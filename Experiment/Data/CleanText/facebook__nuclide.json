    "mostafaeweda": "I could reproduce that and will work on a fix where you would see the error in the caller (part 1) and could navigate to the method definition from the tooltip (part 2).\n. part one is now fixed with: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/cb35f22c2b73cf883d1a2024249f9b27697338b0\npart two will come later with the usage of linter-plus\n. that was fixed by the introduction of traces with the new diagnostics framework\n. Now all the hack errors are coming from the hh_client calls, that should be the case.\n. I just confirmed that 3ae2a3a fixes it.\n. I just tried it, and I'm now getting the proper expected errors\n. I just confirmed that 3ae2a3a fixes it.\n. Ah, I know where is that coming from - only the remote event bus created when connecting to a remote project, has a current working directory.\nBut to fix this, the local event bus created for local development, needs to have a current working directory.\nI'll have that fixed for you ASAP.\n. this is fixed now with: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/84f2e3e5033bd1fb6f9d7f1c4e99302d7097622f\n. wanted to let you know that I'm actively working on this now\n. added, will be updated with the next push\n. I could reproduce and will work on a fix for it - thanks for reporting\n. Fixed with: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/a6a1e626ede001135c28b9240cd2dedf433e0168\n. I'm sure this works now, closing - feel free to re-open if that's still the case.\n. I believe looking up large number of files has improved a lot since reporting this. /cc @jgebhardt \n. This should have been fixed with the UP release, http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. @v3ss0n are you using the latest Atom? We are currently fine at Atom 1.6.2.\nHowever, there is a known issue (pending fix) with Atom >= 1.7 that causes such CPU spike.\n. the fix will be out in ~ 2 days\n. this package doesn't even longer exist, replaced by hyperclick and working fine\n. nuclide-installer is gone now with the UP release: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. that was fixed a while ago\n. The syntax highlighting is initially taken from the php text mate bundle: https://github.com/textmate/php.tmbundle and converted to https://github.com/atom/language-php/\n. We probably fixed that in the recent server improvements and the latest UP release: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/ - feel free to reopen otherwise.\n. cc @hansonw \n. @nmn this is not a flow issue.\n@kalch do you see any errors in the console? CMD+ALT+i or in the log on your server: ~/nuclide.nohup.out and /tmp/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log* ?\nThe file should have HACK grammar enabled at the bottom right of the editor, isn't this the case?\n. Also, make sure you have the .hhconfig file in your remote project root directory.\nI just tried the latest released Nuclide and I see, 3 of those are coming from the hack worker linter and 3 coming from hh_client call:\n\nSo, just to be sure, even if you don't have .hhconfig and just edit a hack grammar file, you should be getting hack lint errors and autocompletions from the local hack worker.\nI'm also suspecting an installer issue. so, does this happen when you build Nuclide from source?\n. @machee No - it's using a WebWorker model of the hack language\n. @jazzdan that's accurate - but it seems that was an installer issue.\n. this should no longer be an issue with the UP release: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. Could you try now with the latest UP package release and feel free to open if that's still an issue: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. Oh, thanks for finding this - coming a fix.\n. Indeed, we are still behind on the javascript code format provider.\nHowever, we have a new to-be-released package that cares about providing missed require statements, and formatting the javascipt code on a rule-based model that could be what you are looking for.\n. I'd close this now and please look for the next release's new package: format-js\n. Refer to #321 for general Nuclide windows support,\nFor the -k, /cc @peterhal @zertosh \n. Our hack linter, based on a hack worker can only process and lint files that has a valid path.\nHence, what this won't really fix it, but what would fix the usage for you is to save the hack file as .php or .hh file and every hack language feature should work fine with you.\n. @steelbrain we ae moving away from the linter anyways for the sake of the new diagnostics package. This is just a safety check that ensures whatever linter or diagnostics versions we use, the hack linter specifically won't lint null or undefined path files/editors.\n. working on it as of writing this\n. Added in d7e89d2\n. All those issues should now be gone with our latest UP release: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. this is working fine now, must have been fixed but not followed up here.\n. this is fixed now, try installing the latest Nuclide, see our latest UP release: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. This went through major changes and now the experience should be much better with the UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. The newly integrated Node debugger should now be working.. The install process have improved a lot with our UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/ - feel free to reopen if still applies.\n. The UP release should have fixed this, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. this is probably an install issue, because the new package versions should have nuclide-atom-helpers as dependency, having projects.js which exports as you see in: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/atom-helpers/lib/projects.js#L90 - try re-installing or installing from source.\n. The second issue has been fixed and will be pushed soon.\nThe first issue, that wasn't the case because we are developing with the hack service remotely with node v0.12.x with --harmony flag - which has the contains method --> will replace with indexOf to work everywhere\n. the first issue has been fixed and will be pushed as well, thanks for the detailed report.\n. Nuclide's high CPU issue should have been addressed with the UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/ - feel free to reopen if still applies.\n. @abourget what version of flow are you running?. That should be fixed in the latest nuclide release. A new HHVM debugger has been ported to Nuclide since then -- please update to the latest and see if things are fixed.. https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9841#issuecomment-345393394. All installation issues should have been fixed with out UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. All installation issues should have been fixed with out UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. this should have been fixed with the UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/ - feel free to reopen if still applies.\n. closing, duplicate issue\n. I just double-verified that all hyperclick providers now have the providerName property.\nHence, I'm pretty sure this is fixed with our latest UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. @nmote could you look into that?\n. this is now fixed - also, make sure you are using the latest nuclide / watchman / mercurial\n. closing this in favor for a general nuclide windows support, #321 \n. /cc @ssorallen\n. yea, switch to our latest Nuclide UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. yea, let's take this in - I've just verified that nothing wrong would come from that.\n. Please try our latest Up release in http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/, and feel free to open if that's still the case.\n. The install process should have improved a lot with out latest UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. Proper windows support, refer to #321 \n. Does your Mercurial repository have a branch remote/master?\nIf so, what's the result of running the command:\nhg log --template {rev} --rev \"ancestor(remote/master, .)\"\nHowever, the 'remote/master' should be auto-detected in a better way rather than define it as a constant FORK_BASE_BOOKMARK_NAME in HgServiceBase.js because it could be different between repositories.\n. The only simple fix is to change the source to be 'default' instead of 'remore/master' until I handle that in a better way. Thanks for reporting.\n. The commit here isn't a definitive fix for every use case, because every commit in Mercurial is a commit on the default (if you use bookmarks to stack your work instead of branches), but it will fix that error and the 'Diff View' would work fine, just not include multiple commits because the fork base is default.\nSince different Mercurial projects have different origin master bookmarks, referring to the compare point of your work. To define a custom fork base, create a file .arcconfig in your project root with the contents:\njson\n{\n  \"arc.feature.start.default\": \"$default_fork_base\"\n}\n. For windows support, refer to #321 - otherwise, I believe this should be fixed with our latest UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. Now we can close this with our latest UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. This have been fixed with the UP release, see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. The collision is avoided when hyperclick is used, and that will be fixed for you with the next release - keep tuned.\nThanks for reporting.\n. Could you verify if our latest UP release fixes this, http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/ - otherwise, feel free to reopen.\n. I can't seem to be able to reproduce that, any repro steps I can try? is this on the latest UP release?\n. All installation issues should have been fixed with our UP release see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. For windows support, refer to: #321\nBut all installation issues should have been fixed with our UP release see: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. This would need to be refactored to use the service framework to be able to use for remote projects as well.\n. look at HgService.js and FileSystemService.js and usages in nuclide's code base as a reference to use the service framework.\n. Great to hear, would be good as well to sync with @nathansobo & @maxbrunsfeld about Atom's async GitRepository implementation, hopefully we can do it once or at least reuse parts of it.\n. @viatsko would be even cooler to have git compatibility with the 'Diff Viewer' through implementing the called methods on _repository here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/diff-view/lib/RepositoryStack.js\n. Sure, we can create a default config that's merged with fb/config if that exists.\n. I understand libgit2, git-utils & nodegit are synchronous and we want to avoid that trap (I think the original GitRepository implementation uses that), hence, I believe the git shell commands implementation is our best option, we do that for mercurial as well, see the implementation.\n. Actually, nodegit is not synchronous (it's now used in Atom's new async git implementation: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/8df13c584981a2c3475acdd406c59afb5e3c37e0/src/git-repository-async.js & see how to get the blame info from it here: https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/blob/master/test/tests/blame.js#L31)\n. @viatsko we had a discussion about that recently and I'd love if you could hack around that (maybe even replacing the original instance somehow after nuclide loads).\n. I'd like to defer this until Atom's GitRepository implementation is all async API and serviceable, so, we can use for local and remote development.\nAtom have promised that's an in-progress project to move away from the sync nature of the git repo implementation.\n. This fixes it by consuming the event (stopping its propagation to the multi-cusror) if it's a hyperclick event (a definition is already highlighted/underlined): https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/7419c1d6987914d5da56a09bd25a9defe59d8d89\n. Please upgrade to the latest Nuclide and see if that's fixed. Please upgrade to the latest. I'm pretty sure we only support  buck projects for C++ features. /cc @hansonw \n. @darrenkenny we do accept PRs, please submit one and we shall put it in as soon as possible.\n. Could you add some description explaining what are you trying to do?\n. @alanzanattadev that's because this option calls a sync method: getRealPathSync which can't be supported on remote directories (because any remote operation is async).\nWe hope Atom will move away from using any of those synchronous APIs, so we and other third party developers can be more compatible no matter what we try to achieve.\nAs this is non-actionable for us at the moment, I'll close and please avoid that option when developing on Nuclide.\n. The git file tree highlighting is coming pretty soon (actively working on it and turned out to be super easy).\nIt needs Atom >= 1.6.x\n. As the message says, the Diff View doesn't yet support git - that may change when we use Atom 1.7 and build on the GitRepositoryAsync\n. Not yet, unfortunately \n. That's not coming soon, however I'm open to contributions enabling it though.. As the error message explains, currently, the Diff View supports Mercurial repositories only, not Git at the moment.\n. Duplicate of #436\n. The error is not directly related to the git tree highlighting, but is coming from Atom's core pathwatcher module -- in a code path intended to update the contents of a directory when it changes on the filesystem.\nThe error indicates that it can't watch that directory --> could that be a permissions issue?\nIf the node module pathwatcher can't watch the directory -- then, probably the GitRepository can't as well, hence, missing status updates causing the file tree color to go out of sync.\nDoes that work with Atom's file tree?\n. I can't reproduce this neither on Atom 1.6.2 not on Atom 1.7.3 -- it seems to pick the changes and update correctly here. any indicators on when this happen? errors in the dev tools console?\n. The newly integrated Node debugger should work for newer node versions.. cc @matthewwithanm for the react-native stuff\n. cc @zertosh \n. Please upgrade to the latest Atom & Nuclide and this should be fixed. Nuclide doesn't yet support windows, tracked in #321\n. the tests aren't passing with that change - I had to split to:\njs\n{\n  'match': '(!==|!=|===|==)'\n  'name': 'keyword.operator.comparison.php'\n}\n{\n  'match': '=|\\\\+=|\\\\-=|\\\\*=|/=|%=|&=|\\\\|=|\\\\^=|<<=|>>='\n  'name': 'keyword.operator.assignment.php'\n}\n{\n  'match': '(<=|>=|<>|<|>)'\n  'name': 'keyword.operator.comparison.php'\n}\nto fix the handling of <<= and >>= while matching != and === as keyword.operator.comparison.php\n. duplicate of #555\n. The newly integrated RN debugger should have this fixed already. I'm back and @shushz is pretty accurate, Atom has no easy API / way to save and restore pane layout, hence, I went ahead without it, but will probably add it in the future - thanks for your feedback.\n. That option was added to mercurial around 2 years ago, hence, I'd recommend updating your mercurial to the latest.\n. We're included a better RN and Node debugger integration in Nuclide, so, these issues are fixed.. That seems just an Atom segfault crash, doesn't seem related to Nuclide.\n. duplicate of #705\n. This seems like a bad installation of Nuclide, can you re-install and reopen if that's still broken. The new node debugger should've fixed this already.. @zertosh that's happening with atom:// uris, not local paths.\n--> I have a fix coming for this in the works.\n. Do you have the mercurial smartlog extension? It's a KP that the Diff View doesn't work for all open source mercurial setups because the smartlog extension isn't always there / enabled.\n. cc @DurhamG \n. Plz try the latest Nuclide (where a ton of improvements were made) to see if this is still an issue.. fix for this on the way\n. Seems to be caused by the same install #856\n. Are you working on a mercurial repository?\nI see the error is coming from this piece of code: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/cf7878ec6bb6e2f4fbaa42f22d2c3d525cd8a37a/pkg/nuclide-bookshelf/lib/applyActionMiddleware.js#L57-L104\nwhile all the bound functions already exist in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/cf7878ec6bb6e2f4fbaa42f22d2c3d525cd8a37a/pkg/nuclide-hg-repository-client/lib/HgRepositoryClient.js\nSo, I suspect something is bad with your Nuclide setup.\nCould you update to the latest version and let me know if it reproduces and how to reproduce it?\n. @acenicks glad that's now fixed\n. We fixed big perf issues in the latest Nuclide release as well.. @bitranch could you check Atom console for a more detailed error message?\nSeems to be there's some hg call failure, could you have an old mercurial installed?\n. CMD+ALT+I --> it will open the chrome dev tools\n. Mercurial is usually installed in /usr/local/bin/ which I can't find in your PATH - hence causing this error.. That should be fixed in the latest RN debugger release.. It\u2019s currently in master  (if you build from source) and will be in next week\u2019s release . This should be fixed with the new RN debugger.. Is this a git or mercurial repository?. Nuclide deactivates the default Atom file tree package on initialization as nuclide brings its own file tree implementation (that works with remote projects).\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-file-tree/lib/main.js#L304-L348\nSince you disabled all of nuclide manually, I'd recommend that you enable Atom's file tree manually too - sorry for the inconvenience.. @zardra that was the case initially, but was removed in response to user feedback - please revise https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/89e4838e026e0474e74caacbf2dd1b0474666828. Now that the console has clickable links (came in the last release) to go to the created/updated revision - I'd say it's totally fine if the dialog goes away, because you can use the console to go there.\nHowever, a config option is also fine with me.  My point is: 89e4838 was done in response to user feedback, so we shouldn't just revert it.. Since the file highlighting worked while mercurial / watchman weren't setup correctly, I assume you are working on a git repository - while the Diff View currently supports Mercurial repositories only.\nSee https://nuclide.io/docs/features/hg/ & https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/436. Could you not have the repository folder not set as your current working directory?\nIf not, right click the folder and click \"Set to Current Working Root\"\nAlso, are you sure you are using the latest Nuclide/Atom/Watchman/Mercurial? - check the install guide at https://nuclide.io/docs/editor/setup/#quick-install\nIf none of that help, I'd check Atom's console for error messages (Open using CMD+SHIFT+I).. Also, plz upgrade to the latest Nucldie. That was fixed in a later Nuclide & Atom version -- plz upgrade to the latest.. The new React Native debugger should have this fixed, plz try it out.. This will be fixed in the next release as we take the source control navigator out of the open source release - since it's adding more trouble than value.. Nuclide should've auto-installed the language-babel apm package, which is the default for js and jsx syntax highlighting.\nHowever, I can't seem to reproduce the Text & tab behavior neither in js nor jsx files.\nCould you give a more detailed description of what you're trying to do / expect, and how is it related to Nuclide?. Closing for missing details / repro steps, please re-open if this is still and issue and help with more details.. That should be fixed now with the debugger old channel removed and cleaned up.. Please update to the latest Nuclide and let us know if this is still an issue. This seems coming from the flow package, not Nuclide.\nYou shouldn't need that package as Nuclide already provides decent flow support. I see you're using an old nuclide version, please update to the latest and re-open if that's still the case. I just released 0.236.0 today. Ooops, I missed the apm publish piece of the release. It should now be available.. I see you're using an older version of nuclide - please update and see if that's still the case.\nIf so, please re-open. You seem to be on an older version of nuclide - please update to the latest & re-open if that's still happening. I'm sorry we missed publishing the apm pieces of the release (we're getting that fixed now).\nWe just published the 0.236.0 and you should be good to go.. React Native debugger support was dropped by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/fccd95d310d021ad67a6e524066bd9ab91e0e3ca\nWe intend to bring a better one back in the future. Debugging React Native is coming back to Nuclide next week & sorry that it had to be taken out due to low quality concerns.. That only came out today in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/0f47df4a2721c2f5456f2e310196efc3e6c71a7a \u2014 you can either build Nuclide from source or wait for next week\u2019s release. Next week, most-likely Tuesday, November 28th. That's now fixed. That was fixed in a later Atom / Nuclide version -- please update to the latest.. We've added new (& more stable) Node and RN debugger integrations in the latest release.\nYou can trigger Launch or Attach from the menu or command palette.. It seems you've connected a Native debugger (C++), not the React Native one.\nA better RN debugger was recently added to Nuclide -- please update and let us know if that's still broken.. That only came last week in 0f47df4 \u2014 you can either build Nuclide from source or wait for next week\u2019s release. You'd be able to Launch / Attach from the Nuclide menu, Command Palette or the Launch/Attach buttons.. Your installed node version is probably old -- it should be >= v7.4.0. Sorry, that regressed (in the nuclide-debugger rewrite) due to that line change: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-debugger/package.json#L82 -- if you remove it from your nuclide installation, it'll bring back the debugger.\nIn the meantime, I'll work on a proper fix.. That was fixed in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/0a2f7b1ffcdc29f3322e3c64980ab342827cbee9, you can either build from source or wait for next week's release.. You may disable JS Auto-Imports from Atom's settings page:\nPackages -> nuclide -- scroll to the bottom, and expand the Enabled Features section.\n\nThere, you can uncheck Enable the \"nuclide-js-imports-client\" feature to disable it\n\n. After disabling, please restart Atom/Nuclide as that could be a bug in the deactivation flow - cc @hansonw. I see you already have a saved profile: magnec (doesn't that profile have the remote command saved with it) - if that didn't save the command, could you try deleting it and creating it again?\nI see you have an error here of nuclide-start-server -- that should be something like: \n~/nuclide-server/pkg/nuclide-server/nuclide-start-server (a path to your nuclide server installation). Yes, you must have it as Nuclide would need these server pices to achieve things like: code editing, language services, debugging . You need both: client and server setup, find documentation at: https://nuclide.io/docs/editor/setup/#installing-nuclide-server. I'm unable to reproduce at the latest - with some fixes around this, could you update to the latest and re-open with reproduce steps & environment details (installed packages, open files, debugger type) to help us fix it.. Please update to the latest nuclide and re-open with reproduce steps as this stack trace doesn't yield code on the line.\nI'm also wondering if you have something that sends text/non-json to localhost:9615 as that port is taken by nuclide to enable python auto-attach debugging: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/modules/atom-ide-debugger-python/RemoteDebuggerCommandService.js#L39. Yes, in nuclide's atom's package settings, expand the last section Enabled Features to find the option to do so:\n\nChange that to Never and it'd disable that sub-package.. Nuclide is only surfacing the linter results.\nI see you're using php-linter which looks non-happy with that syntax.\ncc @ljw1004 @arxanas . We've root-caused this to these lines (if removed, fixes the issue)\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/228d32d6f4573c52e7c0c72df83583548e18c891/pkg/nuclide-js-imports-client/package.json#L76-L78\nA proper fix is on its way with the next release.\n. I've just released https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/releases/tag/v0.366.0 which has this issue fixed - please update.. What extension are you using to power the eslint diagnostics? can you help trace the issue down?. This should be .dirname bc removing the second argument from the join call makes it no-op and won't detect mercurial repositories \n. please do this filtering to avoid calling the expensive buck query unless we're sure this is a rust target & this call will have value.. change to use async / await :\njs\nexport async function getSaveAnalysisTargets(\n...\n  const deps = await BuckService.query(buckRoot, query, []);\n  return deps.map(dep => dep + '#save-analysis');\n}. how long does this typically take for large rust targets? do we need to report its progress?. There's an invalid assumption here that the multi-project language service will only have one LSP server that we need to update its build command (while in reality there can be multiple buck roots, each having a different LSP server -- according to the project files config below).\nDo you need to getAllLanguageServices or observeLanguageServices?\nCan you test with multiple buck roots to see if things work properly?. we don't seem to need this to be an instance variable, right?. that's a non disposed registration, maybe this function should just:\nreturn service.onDidCompleteTask.... Before issuing these 2 potentially-expensive buck calls, could we verify that's actually a Rust target? (maybe using task.buildRuleType.type?. ",
    "steelbrain": "It's an AtomLinter thingy, We've already fixed it in it's rewrite repo https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-plus/pull/3#issuecomment-105521081\n. I fail to think of a reason to choose {type:\"Error\", file:Message.File, position: Message.Position, message: Message.desc} over new Error(Message.desc, Message.File, Message.Position).\nthat Error class however at some points make the codebase of linter-plus simpler.\n. Thank you for providing a valid reason. I agree that Error and Trace constructors are not future proof, It would introduce complications when we add new parameters to constructors.\nOn a side note, createError isn't really the cleanest way to do this, so I am gonna make linter-plus accept Error like Objects very soon after the PR mentioned above has been accepted.\n. @bolinfest That new API has landed in the master branch. You can check out the new API in README. It's right according to what you suggested.\n. @bolinfest The original linter has been depreciated and will be removed soon, all packages are advised to switch to plus API. \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. @k2b6s9j Yep, the linter-plus package can now be unpublished.\n. Yep. I did the same in my language-hack :stuck_out_tongue: \nSo do you guys have any plan about when you can focus on the language-hack fixes or are you waiting for the community to do it?\n. @mostafaeweda I am not sure if I had explained accurately what I was trying to. This is a check that avoids linting files that have not been saved yet (textEditor.getPath() returns empty).\nI have already moved this check to the core linter, You can just skip it in the providers.\n. Understandable.\n. I believe this to be the culprit https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/hack/lib/hack.js#L56-L60\n. @elijahb You can work around this by removing these lines unless it's fixed https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/3ae2a3a9c5ac679ae983c88fba76ad9a919093ff/pkg/nuclide/hack/lib/hack.js#L58-L62\nPlease note that this solution has only been tested on a local hhvm installation. Not sure if it'll work for remote ones.\n. I was using the hack one. but as I said, it's slow even on settings view so not sure if the provider is the culprit.\n. It was a rough guess, nothing too solid. I guessed it by disabling all the provider packages of nuclide and only enabled the core ones.\n. I am super-streched up between work, will provide more info once I am free.\n. No I mean atom-package-deps\n. @bolinfest atom-linter is our helper module in linter, atom-package-deps uses it for it's exec method, but it could be freed from it, not a big deal.\n. @bolinfest class makes things look simpler but that's not the reason it's there, while I was developing that module, I had some non-static methods on it. It can all be just replaced with exports now.\nand Thanks for the tip about async/await. I use non-transpiled ES6 in some of my projects so use Pure ES6 even when using babel, You're right, I should be taking advantage of ES7.\nYes, we're forcing a re-enable because packages that depend on each other can't work properly unless all of them are active. For example linter-ruby can't work if linter is deactivated, so to properly deactivate, the user should deactivate them both. But I get the idea that with nuclide, people would want to disable some and use others, I'll add a second argument to install method for that.\n. @bolinfest all the changes/features you proposed have been implemented and are there in the latest version. We are adding some test cases but that shouldn't be a blocker.\n. @bolinfest the implementation seems nice, except that you are spawning a process per dependency, where package-deps spawns just one process for all the deps.\n. Thank You @mostafaeweda . This has been around before the rewrite was published and Yep we should've documented it. I find it to be a cleaner approach than an attribute. and No we don't have too much special values, this is actually the only one. Everybody has a personal taste, and I respect yours :smiley: \n. Thanks for the investigation into this @shushz \nLinter needs that element to highlight entries in tree view. It does not listen for or stop any kind-of events. Furthermore it works fine in the builtin Tree View, so maybe nuclide should modify it's tree view click event handling?\nI'm asking you this because after a quick investigation, I wasn't able to find any other way (without a ton of complexity that is) to decorate the tree view without adding anything to tree view elements.\nEdit Here's a css snapshot from builtin tree view\n\n. @matthewwithanm I would add it very happily, In fact I'll push an update very soon doing it.\nIn the meantime, if you could have a look inside what's changed between Nuclide v0.218 and v0.219's css that made the linter elements appear all over the tree view, that would fix it for any other packages out there adding decorations on TreeView, because their decorations work with Atom's tree view but only break on yours :). ",
    "ssorallen": "Closing this since Nuclide now uses its own nuclide-diagnostics-ui and this issue was for the AtomLinter.\n. @simonwelsh, does that commit fix the issue for you?\n. @simonwelsh, does the commit that @fredemmott mentioned fix the issue for you?\n. Thanks for the change.\nThis brings up a question: should an item be selected if it is right-clicked / ctrl-clicked? The OS X Finder outlines the right-clicked item to give a hint which item is being edited, but it does not change the selection.\n. Yup, parity with the default tree view seems reasonable for now. :+1: \n. @knowbody the key for accepting a suggestion is configurable in the \"autocomplete-plus\" package. Go to Settings > Packages > Search for \"autocomplete-plus\". Scroll down to \"Keymap For Confirming A Suggestion\".\n\n. A connection status somewhere is a good idea, and I like the mock. I'm afraid the status bar is getting cramped though, and I wonder if it could live elsewhere. It'd be nice to have it near the file tree so there's always a visual cue you are editing remote files. Maybe we could add a status bar above the file tree?\n. @knowbody, we are looking at some additions to your pull request internally. Specifically, when you disable the nuclide-file-tree package the bundled Atom file-tree should re-enable.\n. Great. Thanks for pull request, it prompted us to make nuclide-file-tree interact with Atom's tree-view better. If you still have problems, please comment or re-open the PR/issue.\n. This looks like an installation problem with Atom from a much earlier version. Have you tried after updating to a newer version of Atom?\nI'm going to close this because we can't do anything here. If you still have problems after updating, please comment and reopen the issue if relevant.\n. Thanks for the issue.\nThe latter two are intentional in our file tree, but we are definitely interested in feedback. You can either expand a directory by clicking the arrow next to it or by first selecting the directory and then clicking again.\n3 is unintended, and we will look at merging the PR to prevent the second tree from displaying.\n. Thanks for pointing that out, @enilsen16. That package looks to be relying on the file tree using the icon-file-text icon for all file types, but Nuclide's tree does some file type customization already. I'll open a separate issue to track that.\n. 'nuclide-file-tree' now permanently disables Atom's 'tree-view' package. If you disable 'nuclide-file-tree' via Atom's Settings view, 'nuclide-file-tree' will re-enable 'tree-view' (https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/file-tree/lib/main.js#L153). If you run Atom in safe mode you will have to manually re-enable 'tree-view' or remove it from disabledPackages in ~/.atom/config.cson.\n. Thanks for the report. We've run into this as well, and it's on our radar. As soon as it's fixed, we'll update this issue.\n. This issue should be fixed in 'nuclide-file-tree' now. If you install from source and still see this problem, let me know.\n. Thanks for the report. We are taking a look at a fix.\n. The \"New\" context menu item now displays only when a single directory is selected, which prevents this error from happening: db6ace70cf013bedd54c9e6ae3567a95019350a8\n. This was fixed by 7481487b5fe7d9e96f7e37515ab0d397b3abb972. Please update your Nuclide and comment if you're still having this issue.\n. Can you try installing the package directly to get a more detailed error:\napm install language-hack\n. @balaji, for now we are removing the icon-file-code usage inside Nuclide so this package will work. We can look at a more robust API for file tree customization later.\n. This is fixed with commit 40419734edc14fdebd8a0314aa5015eceea893e8. Nuclide's file tree does less customization to allow the file-icons package to work.\n. Hold tight, we are working on a fix right now.\n. We have a fix for this that will make it to the GitHub repo in the next push. It was due to Atom v0.206.0 permanently removing deprecated APIs.\n. This was fixed by commit fe5f0e7cd9608c640c612bc119d0a0287e036ccf. Please comment if anyone is still seeing this problem after installing the latest Nuclide packages.\n. Closing as a duplicate of #38.\n. This is the same as issues #38 and #42. We have a fix for this that will be included in our next push to GitHub.\n. Thanks for the report. This is a duplicate of #38.\n. Thanks for the report. This is related to #3 and will likely be fixed when that issue is. We will update this issue as well when a fix is pushed.\n. If you are having problems re-enabling right now, you can edit ~/.atom/config.cson and remove the \"tree-view\" from the list of disabled packages:\n\"*\":\n  ...\n  core:\n    disabledPackages: [\n      \"tree-view\" # REMOVE THIS LINE\n    ]\n. The supported way to re-enable Atom's tree-view is to disable the nuclide-file-tree package and re-enable tree-view. The nuclide-file-tree-deux package will be the supported version shortly.\n. Thanks for pointing that out. We are looking at renaming Nuclide's to fix the naming conflict.\n. Babel is unable to transpile Flow's union type it looks like.\n@bolinfest, where is the Babel version specified? Maybe that syntax was not supported in an older version.\n. Can you try upgrading Node and reinstalling? The mention is buried, but Nuclide requires v0.12.0+: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide#installation\n. The nuclide-file-tree package has been rewritten since this issue was open. I'm going to close this, but feel free to re-open if you see problems with the new version.\n. Hi, @Andreyco. Since the codebase has changed significantly since you opened this issue, can you try pulling latest and rebuilding? I am going to close this since it happened a while ago, but please reopen if you have issues after pulling again.\n. Thanks for the report. Can you paste the error you're seeing in the developer console?\n. Oh I must have misread your comment. Is there anything significant about the file(s) you tried to delete, like were they owned by the same user as user that launched Nuclide? Were you able to successfully delete any files or directories?\n. Okay, thanks for the clarification.\nThe different style prompt might be enough to track down this bug.\n. Actually, would you mind taking a screenshot of the prompts you are seeing for folders vs. files?\n. No problem, thanks for the screenshot and more details. It sounds like an Ubuntu-specific issue.\n. Thanks for tracking that down, @aewing. Nuclide's file tree is separate from Atom's, but I suspect they're doing the same thing and hitting the same bug.\n. Thanks for the note. This seems reasonable to replicate, so we will take a look.\n. This is now in master. alt-click on directories recursively expands or collapses them.\nCommit 4f640638480bc1177863547cb453c99c257f6f6d added the functionality.\n. Thanks for the update, @k2b6s9j. We will merge internally and push back to the GitHub repo to accept your PR.\n. We got linter merged internally. If everything looks good, I will merge/push/deploy everything tomorrow morning. Thanks for the docs update and the updates to the Linter.\n. Thanks for the PRs, @k2b6s9j. We will merge these.\n. This made it into master with commit https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/97c423f2b80527677841a0726ead89ae39a3a965\n. This could instead use the same selector that the 'tabs' package does: .tab.\nNuclide's file-tree could add an entry in keymaps.cson and listen for a new command called something like 'nuclide-file-tree:reveal-tab-file' and assume it needs to look up the path to reveal on the tab's data-path.\n. This was added in commit https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/6555291ad129445bb8801aea101c71acc1f9e767\n. Closing this for now. File system functionality like cut/copy/paste is better served by your operating system's file manager.\n. Closing this for now. File system functionality like cut/copy/paste is better served by your operating system's file manager.\n. Closing this for now. File system functionality like cut/copy/paste is better served by your operating system's file manager.\n. @jacobdufault The error you pasted looks like it's Node's fs.rename failing when attempting to move temporary files across partitions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12196163/node-js-fs-rename-doesnt-work\nThis is happening in babel-cache.js: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/node-transpiler/lib/babel-cache.js#L95\n. > In my opinion, I would love to see the 'nuclide installer' as the root Atom package, from there it is an abstracted settings and package management panel purely for the nuclide packages.\n@LukeeeeBennett, stay tuned. We have been exploring that direction to address the many valid critiques of the current approach that make Nuclide difficult to install and update. More updates when we've got something to show.\n. Thanks. I'd like to make the file tree open files on single click as well to support Atom's preview tabs. We will take a look at this.\n. Fixed with commit https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/893af8f365ef4cbfed26cb439c332b2d44a0f851.\n. @joshuahhh, try running brew update first. brew info watchman lists 3.2.0 as the latest version for me. watch-project was added in 3.1.0, so a normal Homebrew install should get you a sufficiently new version.\n. @constantx I think you want brew update && brew upgrade watchman. update updates Homebrew itself, and upgrade watchman scopes upgrades to just Watchman.\n. /tmp directory issue is mentioned on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12196163/node-js-fs-rename-doesnt-work\n. Wakatime looks interesting, but we will leave it up to individual developers to add that to their Atom install. Time tracking in an IDE is interesting but not a necessity.\n. How did you install Flow? It'd be great to find out if Nuclide's check fails on any OS with a standard Flow install. \n. Related to #86.\n. Thanks for the PR. We are going to check out the mv NPM package and make sure it will work for everyone.\n. This looks related to the Windows + Git installation problem: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/56#issuecomment-111715649\nShipping transpiled code is something we have discussed, but it is not yet in the works.\n. This problem also occurred for some users when installing Atom: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5346 It appears related to how Git was installed and whether it has support for \"https\" repos.\n. @jgebhardt, are you familiar with JSX language support in Atom or Nuclide? Nuclide ships Hack support via https://atom.io/packages/nuclide-language-hack, but I'm unaware of how JSX is handled.\n. Thanks for the detailed bug report. The stack trace might be enough for us to track this down until we are able to toggle between minified and un-minified React builds.\n. @jgebhardt This exception originates in the connection dialog. Can you take a look? Excerpt from above:\nat [object Object].ReactBrowserComponentMixin.getDOMNode (/Users/kfischer/.atom/packages/nuclide-file-tree/node_modules/react-for-atom/node_modules/react/lib/ReactBrowserComponentMixin.js:25:12)\nat [object Object].close (/Users/kfischer/.atom/packages/nuclide-remote-projects/node_modules/nuclide-ssh-dialog/lib/ConnectionDialog.js:476:39)\nat Object.onError (/Users/kfischer/.atom/packages/nuclide-remote-projects/node_modules/nuclide-ssh-dialog/lib/ConnectionDialog.js:377:16)\n. @jgebhardt this does look like an error in the ConnectionDialog's logic. It tries to unmount itself regardless of whether it is currently mounted: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/ssh-dialog/lib/ConnectionDialog.js#L444\nThis looks like it could happen if the user closes the dialog and then the SshHandshake resolves after that and tries to close the modal again.\nclose could guard against this:\n``` javascript\n  close() {\n    ...\nvar domNode = React.findDOMNode(this);\nif (domNode) {\n  React.unmountComponentAtNode(domNode.parentNode);\n}\n\n},\n``\n. @MerlinYu Are you having a similar issue? I'm going to lock this issue since it's quite old. Please open a new one, and we will take a look.\n. This transpilation error looks similar to #14. Can you see which version of Babel you are using viacat pkg/nuclide/node-transpiler/node_modules/babel-core/package.json`?\n. Thanks for the confirming Node v0.12.x solved your issue.\n@Keno, I agree the error message could easily be better. I am going to close this and track the error message improvement in #111.\n. I'm going to close this in favor of #84 so we can keep the discussion and investigation in one place. Let me know if you feel they are separate issues.\n. @danneu, the linter-plus package has been replaced by linter. That team was planning on unpublishing linter-plus, and it looks like that happened yesterday.\n. Thanks for the fix. We will get it merged.\n. This looks like the same issue as #88. The /tmp directory is likely mounted and effectively on a different device.\n. Thanks for the changes. Could you split this into at least two PRs: one for the pep8/unused imports changes (purely cosmetic changes) and one for whatever is included in the minor bugfixes you mean from the title? That will make it possible for us to review more easily.\n. This was fixed in commit bbbddd2da3546fbe00ea1a4ecbbc0eebe382d4f6.\n. @rafaelgaspar Let me know if you are still seeing this. 'nuclide-file-tree' went through a rewrite to better handle large remote directories, and so I suspect any issue was in the previous version of the code.\n. As of yesterday's release of v0.111.0, Nuclide is a single package and has the same installation process as other Atom packages. Please try apm install nuclide.\nhttp://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. Thanks for the change. Would you mind adding a test case for this? Otherwise it looks good.\n. Looks great, thanks for implementing the feedback. I'll pull this in for internal review and merge today or tomorrow. :+1: \n. Thanks, we appreciate the work. I've been wanting https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/68 implemented since working with larger file trees. That's another scoped feature that should be doable.\n. Thanks for the PR. I'll take a look at this.\n. This looks great, thank you. It needs to handle the case where the filename already exists, and then I think this should be good to go.\n. I'll pull this in to review internally. Thanks for all of this.\n. I tried this locally and found one issue:\n- Select multiple files in the file tree using Cmd/Ctrl + click. Press 'd'. The duplicate dialog pops up even though multiple files are selected. It should instead do nothing.\nAlso one improvement:\n- Append \"copy\" to the new filename so the name in the dialog is immediately a viable name for the new file. No need to check if the \"_copy\" file already exists, the duplicate error will catch that. This should make the filename unique _most of the time though.\n. Also:\n- The new file opens correctly, but it is not selected in the file tree. It should be selected in the file tree after the duplicate is created.\n. Can you rebase this onto master? Then this looks good to go.\n. @cbosuna Is there anything blocking this?\n. Have you been editing remote files?\nThis is the same stack trace as #98, and it looks like the root cause is in the ConnectionDialog. I'm going to close this as a duplicate.\n. @peramsathyam Which release are you using? Are you running from source?\n. The optional \"linter\" package is called out in the docs under Building from Source, but it is admittedly difficult to parse. The visibility of could be improved on that page, and it makes sense to add the package to the README as well.\nThe \"linter-plus\" package has been superseded by the \"linter\" package, the former is now defunct.\n. There's no immediate plan to improve the docs concerning \"linter\". A PR would be great and much appreciated. :+1: \n. Closing for now based on discussion. This should reuse more of the code that already exists in TreeRootComponent because the functionality is largely the same.\n. Since the Atom team hangs out in Slack on atomio.slack.com, we could potentially create a #nuclide channel there. @bolinfest, what do you think?\n. @edvinerikson I am notified when \"nuclide\" (case-insensitive) is mentioned in the Atom Slack channels. I am rossallen in slack. I believe other Nuclide team members have watches in the Atom Slack channels as well. If you have Nuclide questions, mention the word and we will appear.\n. Nice find. Thanks for this.\n. Thanks for the issue. Linking as duplicate of #76 so we see it later.\n. Can you try the latest release, v0.111.0 of 'nuclide'? The nuclide-quick-open package is no longer supported.\nhttp://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. The 'nuclide-file-tree' rewrite landed in master a few weeks ago, and the performance is significantly improved. We had seen similar flame charts as @despairblue, but those are no more.\nClosing this out. Let me know if you see problems with the new tree.\n. This predates the consolidation of Nuclide into a single package. Please install the 'nuclide' Atom package.\n. Thanks for the report. I will take a look at this.\n. Closing this task because this is specific to Nuclide.app.\n. @jaens The fix is in master but not yet in a public release. If you build from source this issue will be fixed, but I realize I closed this early. I'll keep it open until the next public release.\n. cc @mostafaeweda \n. Can you open Developer Tools in Atom and paste the stack trace that shows this exception? Thanks for reporting this.\n. Is https://github.com/travs/atom-package-dependencies the helper module you mean?\n. Aha great. Thanks for the link. @scv119, would this simplify Nuclide's installer at all?\n. Going to close this one since nuclide-click-to-symbol has been replaced. @iostalk, let us know if you still have problems in the nuclide-hyperclick package.\n. @michaeljcalkins The 'nuclide-installer' package no longer exists. The exceptions you're seeing look unrelated. Can you expand the stack traces and paste them into a new issue?\n. This seems to happen consistently for me. I've been hitting cmd-s a few times when I know the Flow annotations are outdated. Any luck tracking down what's happening here?\n. We have major redesigning going on that replaces the many nuclide-* packages with a single 'nuclide' package that primarily aims to fix this issue and several others open on this repo currently. You can install 'nuclide' from source right now the same way as any other Atom package: clone this repo, npm install, apm link. Instructions are in the README (https://github.com/facebook/nuclide#nuclide) and will be updated there.\nThere was no small fix to make the many-package approach work, which is why we haven't addressed this particular GitHub issue yet. One of the people on the team will close many of these issues once there's a full release of the 'nuclide' package ready to try.\n. @UnsungHero97 No promises or dates yet, but we are aiming for a 1-month scale. It's usable from master as a single package already.\n. Looks like read_file needs to open the file in utf-8 encoding: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7585378/368697 I can fix that.\n. The setup script has been removed as of yesterday's release, v0.111.0 of 'nuclide'. Building from source now only requires cloning, npm install, and apm link.\nhttp://nuclide.io/docs/setup/#building-from-source\n. Looks like it's already updated in Homebrew: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commit/ee072f95fd8d68e54db822c8973cc92ee4f74b35#diff-03d9e472713dea7839b461716dca58c4\nTry running brew update and then brew upgrade flow again.\n. A test runner for Jest is something I'd like to add. The test runner interface currently expects JSON output (current JSON shape is in TestSuiteModel.js:19), which Jest/Jasmine do not bundle yet. https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/513 is open to integrate with Arcanist, the CLI for Phabricator which also consumes JSON output for unit testing.\nIt's possible for a test runner to simply write unstructured output to the buffer, but it would offer little more than typing jest on the command line. Would you find it useful for the first iteration to effectively be a button that runs jest and writes stdout output into Nuclide?\n. Are you hitting this problem when opening the settings view? There was a known problem in settings-view that was fixed (https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/555) and will soon be in a release of Atom.\n. It sounds like you may have hit the issue solved in https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/674 It will be fixed with a new release of Atom.\nIf you have other problems, we can try to track down the problem if you add more details.\n. Can you paste the error you were seeing or a screenshot of it?\n. The many Nuclide packages have been unified into just one as of yesterday's release, v0.111.0, making total disk usage under 110MB.\nhttp://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. :+1: \n. Watchman is required for watching for file system changes and for Mercurial support. Do you have that installed?\nI notice now that Watchman is not listed on the setup page. I will add that to the page.\n. Are you able to install via the instructions on Watchman's install page?\n. The setup script has been removed as of yesterday's release, v0.111.0 of 'nuclide'. Building from source now only requires cloning, npm install, and apm link.\nhttp://nuclide.io/docs/setup/#building-from-source\n. @nmote It seems reasonable to generate a unique name if the provider doesn't create one. Hyperclick doesn't seem to care what the string is, so it shouldn't matter to the rest of the code anyway. It can be generated once when the service is consumed.\n. This is still an issue. The Hyperclick provider than originally caused this issue was not owned by Facebook. (see https://github.com/ensime/ensime-atom/issues/102)\nThere's a change being reviewed internally currently to make the name optional.\n. Because the meta key is the accelerator commonly used in other IDEs, Nuclide intentionally chose to use it as well. Ideally Atom would default the multi-cursor accelerator to the alt key or make it configurable so hyperclick could use the meta key.\nGoing to close this for now since the functionality is intentional.\n. The language-babel package supports Flow type annotations. We recommend installing that package and setting \"Babel ES6 JavaScript\" as the default language for '.js' files.\n. We haven't ignored this problem even though we haven't given much response. We have some large organizational changes that aim to dramatically simplify Nuclide installation and solve this problem for good. We don't have an exact timeline, but it is coming in the near term. We will update all relevant tasks when we have more info.\n. Closing as a duplicate of #84.\nThere is major refactoring in progress that will dramatically improve the installation process. I'll use #84 as the place to discuss it when it gets closer to landing.\n. Thanks for bringing all of these up, @urzds. I am going to consolidate these into #246 because they all have the same root cause in the TextEditor.\n. Consolidating into #246 for Nuclide.\n. Consolidating into Nuclide #246.\n. This is perhaps more problematic now given how the 'nuclide' package loads features using Atom's PackageManager. The error reporting reports the exception as having come from the package with the feature's name. The image below is from installing Nuclide via apm install nuclide and throwing an error in 'main.js' of '~/.atom/packages/nuclide/pkg/nuclide/file-tree':\n\ncc @zertosh \n. nuclide-hg-git-bridge incorrectly lists its dependencies as \"devDependencies\" when they should be real \"dependencies\". After letting nuclide-installer do its work, nuclide-blame-provider-hg/node_modules/nuclide-hg-git-bridge/ does not have a node_modules because it lists no real dependencies.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/v0.0.35/pkg/nuclide/hg-git-bridge/package.json#L11\n. Thanks for bringing this up, and I like the idea of adding a CHANGELOG. We have been writing internal release notes, and checking them in to a changelog seems reasonable as well.\n. @bolinfest Oh yes, you're right.\n@BlaM Where did you expect the change log to be? Nuclide updates all of its packages at the same time, and so the changes are aggregated in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md.\n. You can compare tags on GitHub, v0.0.34...v0.0.35 is an example.\n. Going to close this because the changelog exists at the root and the impending refactor of Nuclide into far fewer Atom packages will make the current one-changelog approach make more sense.\n. Looks like the same cause as #253. Merging this one there.\n. @PointedEars Hyperclick is now part of the 'nuclide' package. You can install Nuclide and disable all of the features but Hyperclick if that is the feature you are looking to use. 'hyperclick' v0.0.35 still has the bug you are seeing, but it is fixed in the current release of 'nuclide'.\n. Can you open the developer tools (View > Developer > Developer Tools) and see if there are any exceptions or logs there?\n. @marcpeterson It looks like your issue is Windows-related (it's trying to run which hh_client as a separate process, a command that doesn't exist on Windows). Nuclide needs to switch to something like the 'which' module to do cross-platform binary discovery.\n. @ruler88 You can deselect \"Enable the 'nuclide-file-tree' feature\" (and in the next release \"Enable the 'nuclide-side-bar' feature\" as well) in Settings > Packages > nuclide to disable Nuclide's file-tree. Doing so will re-enable Atom's bundled tree-view.\n\n\nNote that Atom's tree-view does not support remote file systems, which is the main reason Nuclide has its own. If you are planning on doing remote development, you'll need Nuclide's file-tree.\n. In the next release you will only need to disable the 'nuclide-file-tree' feature. The side-bar will hide automatically when it has no consumers.\n. I believe @bolinfest did some work on exactly what you're asking for. Did that get published anywhere?\n.

All of the 'nuclide-*' packages have been replaced by the single 'nuclide' package as of yesterday's release of v0.111.0. Can you try installing that package, and re-open this issue if you still have problems?\nhttp://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. apm uninstall for each package is the way to uninstall Nuclide completely. One way to one-line it is to find all Atom packages beginning with 'nuclide-' and pipe them to apm uninstall:\nfind ~/.atom/packages -name 'nuclide-*' -maxdepth 1 -type d | sed s/.*\\\\/// | xargs apm uninstall\n. @angexis Thanks, I forgot to mention that. It's difficult to build a package that replaces a core Atom package while being a good citizen that re-enables the core package if it's disabled or removed. We chose to disable 'tree-view' permanently but need to document that in case you want to re-enable the core package.\n. To be quite exact and not rely on the output of apm list, I created a list of the 'nuclide-' packages and put them into a single apm uninstall. The script should be straightforward and remove all Nuclide packages: https://gist.github.com/ssorallen/aff66a1c05d865fe4e83\n. There's now a doc on the site for uninstalling the upcoming single-package release and v0.0.35 and prior, which were shipped as many Atom packages.\nhttp://nuclide.io/docs/uninstall/\n. Can you paste the output of apm list --no-dev --installed so we can see which packages you have installed?\n. path.sep in Windows is '\\', which must be escaped to be a literal backslash in a regular expression. Thanks for the bug report.\n. Thanks for the change. The permission error is likely because you don't have an SSH key uploaded to GitHub, but even so the 'https' URLs are the recommended clone URLs in GitHub's documentation: https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/\nWe will switch to the https one as well.\n. We have some major redesigning of Nuclide going on right now that aims to address this issue in particular. We recognize this has made Nuclide unusable for you and many other open source users and are working on getting the new version out soon. You can read instructions on how to try it now (same as other Atom packages) in the README.\nThanks for the issue; we are on it. I am going to close this as a duplicate of #232.\n. hyperclick is bundled with the 'nuclide' package. Can you try uninstalling that? It seems unrelated, but you have it installed as well.\n. @jacob-israel-turner Yes, nuclide-installer, the previous way of installing the Nuclide suite of features, installed the 'hyperclick' package for you. The Hyperclick functionality is now bundled in the 'nuclide' package.\n. @zertosh I can remove Python. I updated the Atom version to at least 1.0 since I don't think we should claim support for such an old version. We might want to adopt an evergreen support policy with Atom: most recent patch release of the current and previous minor versions. That's for another change and pull request though.\n. Gist embedding is supported in GitHub's flavor of Jekyll+plugins. Here's the rendered version:\n\n. Fixes #266.\n. Can you paste the \"disabledPackages\" value from your ~/.atom/config.cson files? It might be the cause of incorrect disabling.\n. Check out the OP's installed packages list:\n```\nUser\ngit-plus, v5.8.2\nnuclide, v0.0.0\nDev\nNo dev packages\n```\nThis is the UP.\n. Although it was from source since the version is v0.0.0. Yeah, makes sense to close it. @eklavya, can you verify if this still happens with the released version of 'nuclide': v0.111.0?\n. I added a page about uninstalling Nuclide (nuclide-installer included) on nuclide.io: http://nuclide.io/docs/uninstall/\nIt lists all published packages and so requires only apm.\n. When did you see this exception?\nWere you working from Nuclide source or from the 'nuclide' package?\n. @jamesgpearce My push -f nuked your comment because it was on the previous SHA. I'm too used to the workflow now. I added \"The Unified Package\" to the title to make it more grandiose.\n. It done be squashed.\n. @nmote, good catch. That does appear to be the issue. The 'nuclide-blame' package's directory name is actually 'blame', which is the cause. The Nuclide loader will have to work around Atom's PackageManager. cc @zertosh \n. The blob from L71-111 could go away.\n@zertosh Will this still be a problem if, say, someone else publishes a 'nuclide-blame' package in the future? We will no longer own the names of Nuclide's \"packages\", so a collision is likely to occur. Do we still need to reserve the names of all of Nuclide's features-cum-packages?\n. The settings-view's definition of \"installed\" could be changed to at least address the Settings page. It currently only checks atom.packages.isPackageLoaded: https://github.com/atom/settings-view/blob/2f4ad155e2159f9ce3e5242ab711ca8a5d9c25a7/lib/package-manager.coffee#L25-L31 Although maybe that's catering to Nuclide's overloading of a \"package\".\n. We chose to leave VIM-style navigation out of Nuclide's file tree for the time being because there has been discussion of introducing alpha-style navigation, i.e. typing \"j\" would jump to the first entry starting with \"j\".\nYou can, however, add this yourself in your custom ~/.atom/keymap.cson. Create the file if it doesn't already exist, and add the following:\ncson\n'.nuclide-file-tree':\n  'h': 'nuclide-file-tree:collapse-directory'\n  'j': 'core:move-down'\n  'k': 'core:move-up'\n  'l': 'nuclide-file-tree:expand-directory'\nEdit: Added h/l to collapse/expand if a directory is selected.\n. > built-in fuzzy/non-fuzzy file search?\n@chenglou Do you mean the modal that opens with cmd-p? The alpha nav I mean is when the tree-view/file-tree is focused, similar to when you open Finder on OS X, focus the tree, and type an alphanumeric character.\n. Have you tried annotating Component instead? Flow's React lib declares Component as a polymorphic class that takes <DefaultProps, Props, State>.\njavascript\nclass DynamicComponent extends Component<void, Props> {\n. Thanks for bringing this up; we need to document this, likely on the Uninstalling Nuclide page.\nAtom packages don't get a chance to respond to being uninstalled. If, for example, you close Atom and then apm uninstall nuclide, the Nuclide package doesn't have an opportunity to clean up.\n. Can you give more info about how this happened? I haven't been able to reproduce this.\n. Did you uninstall Nuclide via Atom's UI? If you uninstall Nuclide from outside Atom, e.g. apm uninstall nuclide or by removing the '~/.atom/packages/nuclide' directory, Nuclide doesn't get a chance to react and clean up after itself.\nWe include a Re-activate Disabled Core Packages section in the Uninstalling doc that explains how to re-enable the 'tree-view' package, but  it's likely not something most people would consider to look for.\n. Okay, thanks for the note. I will make sure tree-view is re-enabled if Nuclide is uninstalled via Atom's UI.\n. This is blocked by https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/128\nIt is not currently possible for a package to know when it is being uninstalled, even if it's done through the Settings View UI.\n. @ZebraFlesh I think leaving Atom's tree-view enabled would lead to a poorer experience than the current state. Having two tree views looks like a bug in Atom, in Nuclide, or in both. I agree the current uninstall experience is not optimal, but we are optimizing for the unwrapping/installation process rather than the teardown/uninstallation process.\n. @smooJitter http://nuclide.io/docs/editor/uninstall/#re-activate-disabled-core-packages\n@ZebraFlesh If Nuclide left Atom's tree-view enabled, I imagine we'd get an equal amount of questions about having two tree views. I would really like to solve this, and I don't think either option is ideal at the moment.\n. @smooJitter mantrajs-atom injects itself into tree-view's DOM by first calling require on the 'tree-view' package itself. Because it's requiring the package by name, there's no opportunity for Nuclide's file-tree, package name 'nuclide-file-tree', to intervene and interoperate with mantrajs. This is a pattern that has no great alternative at the moment but that we would like to solve so package authors can reliably depend on other Atom packages.\n. It should work for remote development. It's possible the Nuclide server is not able to find the flow binary.\n@nmote How can @sometimesalready debug whether the server is able to find the Flow binary?\n. Do you see an exception or any other information?\n. Re-enable the package named 'tree-view' either from within Atom's Settings page (search for 'tree-view' in the Packages tab) or by editing your '~/.atom/config.cson' and removing 'tree-view' from the disabledPackages array.\nNote: Atom's tree-view does not support remote development and does not integrate with Mercurial. You will have to use Nuclide's file-tree if you'd like to use those features.\n. Shoot, nice catch. It's annoying this worked fine locally with no warnings, which is why I overlooked it. \n. @jordwalke It won't work remotely because Nuclide's service framework doesn't know how to serialize a Merlin process instance. 'LocalMerlinService.js' acts as the service definition for the MerlinService, and calls to functions exported from the module that are correctly Flow annotated with primitive types can be serialized. Serialization is handled in the proxy-generator.\nYou could wrap calls to the Merlin process with annotated, exported functions in LocalMerlinService so the calls can be serialized across the service framework properly.\n. @jordwalke It works like it sounds like you're describing. When the LocalMerlinService process is requested locally, it delegates to a local instance and does no serialization; you should get a reference to the Merlin process object if you run this locally.\nIf you want to run this on the server you need to worry about serialization. The service framework is designed to make the existence of serialization transparent to the developer, but it relies on well-annotated services that use a defined set of types that the service framework knows how to serialize.\n``` javascript\nconst {getServiceByNuclideUri} = require('../../client');\n// Because '/some/path' is a local path, localMerlinService will delegate to a local instance\n// of MerlinService and perform no serialization.\nconst localMerlinService = await getServiceByNuclideUri('MerlinService', '/some/path');\n// Because 'nuclide://some/path' is remote, remoteMerlinService will delegate to the service\n// framework and perform serialization of calls according to the proxy generated by parsing\n// the type annotations in 'LocalMerlinService.js'\nconst remoteMerlinService =\n  await getServiceByNuclideUri('MerlinService', 'nuclide://some/path');\n// Calling methods on them looks exactly the same though.\nconst localLocation = await localMerlinService.locate('/another/path', 15, 25, 'foo');\nconst remoteLocation = await remoteMerlinService.locate('/another/path', 15, 25, 'foo');\n```\n. > I wish there was a way to develop without having to worry about testing in two modes.\nThat's a fair point, and in other pull requests from open source contributors we have commented saying, \"but remote won't work\". Maybe in development mode (starting Atom with atom --dev) Nuclide could always create proxies so you'll get the serialization errors during development.\n. @jordwalke :+1: Looking into this now and if it would be possible. Thanks for your feedback.\n. @jordwalke Yeah this looks good. I'll import this internally.\n. > when I'm dev-ing on a project that uses Haste modules\nDid you set Flow to use the Haste module system as well? It's documented in Flow's [options]:\n\n\nmodule.system (node | haste): the module system to use to resolve import and require. Haste is used in React-Native.\n. If flow type-at-pos is not returning what you expect, then the problem is likely with Flow. Nuclide makes that same call to Flow and uses the response to jump to the correct location. Can you open an issue with Flow? https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues\n. Thanks for discovering this. I tested locally, and it looks good to me. I am working on getting it merged.\n. .tool-panel got a display: block; in 1.6; [hidden] used to be the only style modifying display here.\n. Thanks for the report. This is addressed in #354 (see attached commit that closed it) and will be out in the next release (v0.117.0).\n. I believe you minimally need a /* @flow */ annotation at the top of the file in order for Flow to analyze it. Without that annotation, Flow will skip the file.\n. You also need a '.flowconfig' file in the root of your project in order for Flow to start.\nNuclide will start a Flow server for you if it finds a '.flowconfig'\nYou need to hold Command (on Mac) or Ctrl (on Linux/Windows)\n. Closing as a duplicate of #354. The fix will be in the next release, v0.117.0.\n. @tonytbl Did it work in previous versions?\n. @Daniel15 @nmote Atom core is getting pane move commands in v1.6: https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/500afb0f206c23c9b1a844e2ad07a2f286e36453 You will be able to bind them in your own keybindings once we move to 1.6.\n. Looks like this stopped working when the file-tree got wrapped in another container for working-sets. I'll take a look.\n. Merging this into #375.\n. cmd-shift-i will run Nuclide's 'format-js' package on the active text editor, command name \"Nuclide Format Js: Format\". We need to hook it into the 'nuclide-code-format' service as well.\n. Nuclide's diagnostics clashes with the community \"linter\" package. @nmote, what's the current recommendation for linter / diagnostics?\n. Merging this into #375.\n\n\nWindows support is minimal at the moment, but I'd like to at least ensure you get a file tree.\n. Can you try linting your code? It looks like you're missing const or let on your variable declarations, which is something ESLint will catch.\n$ cd /path/to/nuclide\n$ npm install\n$ npm run lint-all\n. Looks good to me. Can you rebase onto latest master?\n@jordwalke, look good to you?\n. Thanks for the catch. I'll get this merged.\n. I had my eye on this one in Atom Beta, thanks for reporting. We will get this fixed soon.\n. Thanks for the report. The Nuclide file-tree has limited Git support at the moment. Closing this as a duplicate of #260 as @lightning18 mentioned.\n. Can you give more information? What does the shortcut map to in Atom+Nuclide?\n.

Hey thanks for the pull request. I haven't yet had a chance to try this, but I will in the next few days.\n. @yuwang17 No it hasn't. I mentioned the issue in my commit, and so GitHub auto-closed it. I can leave this open and close it when the commit makes it into a release.\n. This is out and fixed in v0.128.0.\n@yuwang17, let me know if you still have problems after updating to the latest.\n. Excellent, thank you for this. I was in the middle of downloading VirtualBox and a Windows VM to finally fix this because my hunch was it was something small and path-related. I'll import this internally and get it landed.\n. This breaks a spec I added when I ensured remote development worked on Windows: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/7537bb8a09b1ae13db07a7dfb8ca71bd92aeb3c1/pkg/nuclide-file-tree/spec/FileTreeHelpers-spec.js#L126 You can run the specs yourself by going into the 'pkg/nuclide-file-tree' directory and running apm test. You need to run apm install from the root first if you haven't already.\nI'm unsure what effect that break will have. Do remote directories still work after this change?\n. @Daniel15 I dig the \"dependency injection.\" I'll pull in your changes, make sure everything works on non-Windows, and get this landed. Thanks for fixing the test.\n. Thanks for the report. I began a fix for this yesterday and would like to get it into the next release. I'll reference this issue in the commit so you know when it lands.\n. @inkytonik This landed in master and will be in next week's release.\n. We certainly accept pull requests. New features in the file-tree have not been a priority, but I would gladly review pull requests and get them in.\n. Nuclide doesn't appear to be in your list of installed packages. Are you using Nuclide?\n. @despairblue I'm able to reproduce this on Atom Beta v1.8.0-beta2. I will take a look.\n. @despairblue Can you see what the value of NODE_ENV is in your default environment? Try running NODE_ENV=production atom-beta. I can reproduce this if I run with no NODE_ENV set because it's letting React run in dev mode. I haven't tracked down what in React is breaking, but running in production mode seems to prevent this issue.\n. @despairblue One solution I've discussed with @zertosh is to ship Nuclide with the production/minified version of React that does not include the environment checks. Nuclide needs to eliminate 'react' as a top-level dependency, and then we can make the switch. The NODE_ENV will behave like apparently is desired in Atom v1.8, but it will no longer affect Nuclide's React.\n. For your additional details, having Flow errors in your 'node_modules' folder is a problem Nuclide itself has. We, however, now rely on a passing flow check for new internal commits and have made that possible by ignoring certain folders in Nuclide's '.flowconfig':\n```\nannotated with @flow but have errors\n./node_modules/babel-types/.\n./node_modules/fbjs/lib/.\n./node_modules/sabor/.\n./nuclide-node-transpiler/spec/fixtures/.\n```\nI suggest ignoring failing folders so the output of Flow is always high signal.\n. @Aweary Are you working from Nuclide source?\n. Aha, glad you figured it out.\nMy comment about looking at Nuclide source came from the fact that this GitHub repo does not pass a Flow check. There are 11 Flow errors due to our funny way of try/catching to see if internal modules exist. Separate issue though.\n. @Aweary Is there a .flowconfig in any ancestor directory? Also, try running killall flow to make sure they aren't lingering Flow servers from when you had the .flowconfig file.\n. Thanks, I will fix this. Nuclide was relying on themes to provide a \"progress.less\" file, but that is not part of the theme guidelines and so should not be expected. I plan to remove the nuclide-blame-ui's dependency on \"progress.less\".\n. Fix is in master. This'll go out in the next release.\n. The fix did not make it into v0.135.0. It will be in v0.136.0. Thanks for your patience with this one.\n. v0.136.0 has been released, and I verified the exception no longer happens with seti-ui. Please comment again if you're still seeing this after upgrading.\n. Duplicate of #484.\nThe fix is in master and will be out shortly with the next release.\n. v0.136.0 has been released, and I verified the exception no longer happens with seti-ui. Please comment again if you're still seeing this after upgrading.\n. You can follow the following instructions to uninstall the old versions of Nuclide packages: http://nuclide.io/docs/help/troubleshooting/#uninstalling-older-versions-of-nuclide\n. Thanks. I'll get this merged.\n. Does this still happen after restarting Atom? After an update, packages typically need Atom to be restarted because it maintains some state that might not be cleared properly when installing new versions.\n. The 'src_b' folder doesn't appear expanded in your screenshot. Does 'src_c' show up when you expand 'src_b'?\n. The GIF looks like artifacts from the 'color-picker' package. Nuclide doesn't have a feature involving colors like that.\n. Thanks for the report. I will put up a fix for this.\n. The stack in the comments about the source control side bar is not the same cause as the original issue. I opened #569 to track the side bar issue and am closing this one as can-not-repro given the original comments.\n. Try disabling the 'linter' package. Nuclide and linter have overlapping functionality, and we discourage using both at the same time. See https://nuclide.io/docs/advanced-topics/linter-package-compatibility/\n. That Panes functionality has actually been removed from Nuclide because new commands were added in Atom v1.6 that enabled users to add that themselves.\nCould you remove the entire Panes section instead?\n. @nmote It does, but for some reason the referenced file in this PR is _docs/editor/basics.md whereas the real file lives in docs/_docs/editor/basics.md (extra \"docs\" directory). It can't successfully patch.\n. @simon-johansson Can you rebase this onto master? There is now a top-level \"docs\" directory in which the \"_docs\" directory lives.\n. Did this happen after an automatic update to the 'nuclide' package? Please restart Atom and see if the problem persists.\n. This sounds related to https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/463 and https://github.com/jgebhardt/react-for-atom/issues/13 given that this is from Atom v1.8.0.\n. The 'nuclide-ui-atom-input' package is no longer supported. For the time being, you will need to copy Nuclide's AtomInput.js file into your package. We haven't yet determined a way to release Nuclide's React components for use in other packages.\n. @jurassix Which other components have you found useful?\nA primary issue we are investigating is having multiple versions of React across multiple Atom packages. react-for-atom aims to solve some of that issue, but it is not bulletproof.\n. @jurassix Great, thanks a lot. Would you mind putting your list of components into a new issue with an appropriate title so others can find it? Then we will know not to close it too.\n. Hyperclick v0.0.37 resolves this issue.\nNote that Nuclide bundles Hyperclick. You shouldn't need to have both installed, and having both might lead to strange behavior. It shouldn't, however, lead to exceptions like you were seeing, and that has been fixed in v0.0.37.\n. The commands appear to be bound to the same keys. Did you mean tree-view:reveal-active-file for Atom's tree-view?\nNuclide's file-tree (keymap):\n\".platform-darwin atom-workspace\": {\n  \"cmd-|\": \"nuclide-file-tree:reveal-active-file\"\n},\n\".platform-win32 atom-workspace, .platform-linux atom-workspace\": {\n  \"ctrl-|\": \"nuclide-file-tree:reveal-active-file\"\n},\nAtom's tree-view (keymap):\n'.platform-darwin':\n  'cmd-|': 'tree-view:reveal-active-file'\n'.platform-win32, .platform-linux':\n  'ctrl-|': 'tree-view:reveal-active-file'\n. @tbarash Aha, I see what you mean. Nuclide's file-tree has that feature integrated, and it's called \"Reveal on Switch\". You can enable it in the nuclide package's settings by scrolling down to the \"Nuclide-file-tree\" header:\n\n. Could you keep a reference to the config object to simplify this?\njs\nvar coreDisabledPackages = atom.config.get('core.disabledPackages');\nif (coreDisabledPackages.length === 0 ||\n    coreDisabledPackages.indexOf('tree-view') === -1) {\n  atom.config.pushAtKeyPath('core.disabledPackages', 'tree-view');\n}\n. Jasmine provides a concept for this called spies that does roughly what you did but ensures the methods are restored after each spec. It would look something like this:\n``` javascript\nspyOn(fileTreeController, 'deleteSelection');\natom.commands.dispatch(el, 'core:backspace');\natom.commands.dispatch(el, 'core:delete');\nexpect(fileTreeController.deleteSelection.calls.length).toEqual(2);\n``\n. Thanks for addingcore:backspacetoo. Can you split this into two specs? It might feel like duplication, but it'll be more instructive in the future if one of these commands break because a single, targeted spec will say exactly what failed.\n. To keep to the public API of the FileTreeController, go throughgetTreeComponent` and use React's TestUtils:\n``` javascript\nvar {TestUtils} = require('react-for-atom').addons;\n...\nvar el = TestUtils.findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass(\n  fileTreeController.getTreeComponent(),\n  'nuclide-file-tree'\n);\n``\n. Oh yeah, perfect. I forgot about thefindDOMNodewrapper in that case. :100: \n. I meant to say that that is a good thing. I can't think of why you would intentionally want to capture system exits and/or keyboard interrupts. I think we should merge this.\n. This can be simplified withsome`:\njs\nfunction isPathIgnored(path: string): boolean {\n  return atom.project.getRepositories().some(repo => {\n    return repo && repo.isPathIgnored(path);\n  });\n}\n. Avoid single-line arrow functions if the function body is an assignment because single line arrows implicitly return the value of the expression.\njs\nawait parentNode.fetchChildren().then(nodes => {\n  childNodes = nodes;\n});\n. The ordering here will make expanding a large, remote directory spin for a long time before giving feedback in the UI because this waits to expand the clicked directory until all of its children have expanded. Instead, the clicked directory should expand immediately and then its children should be recursively expanded.\n``` js\n_onClickNodeArrow(...) {\n  this._toggleNodeExpanded(node);\n  if (event.altKey) {\n    this._toggleChildNodesExpanded(node, this._isNodeExpanded(node));\n  }\n}\n``\n. Check outexpandNodeKeyandcollapseNodeKey`; I think the functionality there can be reused to reduce the amount of new code that needs to be rewritten here. Expanding all children might be better as options to those methods to limit new methods on this class too.\n. Since the first assertion confirms the array is length 1, it can be accessed directly:\njs\nreturn nodes.length === 1 && !nodes[0].getItem().isDirectory();\n. Can you move this into _openDialog? It's a bit goofy that it was copied in the first place, we can do a little cleanup here. _openDialog can take props as an argument instead of a ReactComponent.\n. Can merge this and the next conditional:\njs\nif (!selection || selection.entry.isDirectory())\n. Linebreak after the end of objects.\n. :+1: Thanks for this cleanup.\n. This needs to check the return value of create to see whether the file was successfully created or not. If it returns false, that means the file either couldn't be created or already existed.\n. If it couldn't be created, maybe create one more modal with the explanation that it couldn't be created with just an \"OK\" button? Any ideas there? We don't want to fail silently.\n. That seems like a better approach because those functions already implement expanding/collapsing. They could be recursively expand children of the node rather than implement that in a separate function.\n. :+1: A warning notification sounds good to me.\n. This looks great, but let's stick to all async/await rather than switching between that and promises. I also reworded the detail message to remove the \"We\"; I find it eerie when a computer responds like that:\njs\nonConfirm: async (rootDirectory, relativeFilePath) => {\n  var file = rootDirectory.getFile(relativeFilePath);\n  var createdSuccessfully = await file.create();\n  if (createdSuccessfully) {\n    await entry.read().then(text => file.write(text));\n    this._reloadDirectory(entry.getParent());\n    atom.workspace.open(file.getPath());\n  } else {\n    atom.notifications.addWarning(\n      \"Failed to duplicate file\",\n      {\n        dismissable: true,\n        detail: `There was a problem duplicating the file. Please check if the file \"${file.getBaseName()}\" already exists.`,\n      }\n    );\n  }\n},\n. Yeah await takes some practice to feel natural. This is a good rundown: https://github.com/yortus/asyncawait#8-await-in-depth-awaitable-expressions\n. Can you fill this in or delete it? The other dialog methods are also difficult to test, so deleting for now is fine if it's not easily testable.\n. They can be joined like strings here, but the platform-specific delimiter should be used from Node's path.delimiter:\n``` js\nimport path from 'path';\n...\nif (opamBin) {\n  env = ${env}${path.delimiter}${opamBin};\n}\n```\n. The pattern in Nuclide is to import the path module as 'path' and call functions on it.\n``` js\nimport path from 'path';\n...\npath.isAbsolute(node.nodePath) &&\n```\n. Double semicolon here.\n. ",

With Atom 1.0, I installed the nuclide-installer and then each time I tried to install an indiviual Nuclide package, my CPU would peg with 1 or 2 Node processes at 100% CPU.

We would love to add this to the Nuclide file tree, but it's not a high priority in our immediate plans.\nThe package that adds it to the Atom file tree (https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace) is hardcoded to the Atom file tree CSS selectors. Ideally, we would be able to add this through a service-based API.\n. Fixed with https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/0942e4d0022644a6280565b9a5c5b75c5ac0dcc3\n. It should just work. Is it a Git or Mercurial project? Are there any errors in the JavaScript console?\n. Yes, it should work out of the box. It's definitely a bug, so it would be helpful to get more info. You can access the JavaScript console by going to View > Developer > Toggle Developer Tools and viewing the Console tab.\nThis is what I know: The Git support should be built-in to Atom -- Nuclide uses a hook to grab that info, though it only works for local filesystems. Nuclide adds Mercurial support with a package, and that requires watchman (https://github.com/facebook/watchman) to work properly.\nThere's also an open bug tracked internally where the file tree only provides correct reports of version control status for the first project directory. There's a fix ready, so it should be pushed to GitHub soon.\n. It was experimental and relied on some crude heuristics, so we didn't feel confident in enabling it for everybody. However, I don't see a reason not to enable it if people have been using it without issues\nI'll leave it to someone on the core Nuclide to merge this. ",

I'm having the same issue as well. Same configuration here: Atom 1.12.2 - macOS 10.12.1\n. up up. I am the same question, the error output whenever i toggle browser window, and it's browser-plus@0.0.87. @pelmers I don't know if it's related, but maybe you can check this too? https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/1442\nAlso, I guess it really makes sense to include this inside Atom like VS Code did.. I have tried all kind of startup configs. But when i press \"debug js remotely\" in react native, the chrome debug tab opens up always.\nIt works fine with visual studio code. The debugger there is easily able to attach to the process.. Oh, i just found out that \napm install nuclide@0.288.0\nworks. Is there any plans to bring back debug functionality?. ",

Appears to be fixed, guessing c88465e2c107c5a58688d417fd255b808514f55e. cc @mostafaeweda \n. Still reproduces with:\n- Atom 1.11.1\n- Nuclide OSS 0.175.0 or FB 0.175.41189901\n- HHVM 3.15.1 or FB hh_client 4ff77a60291edf59d686e586a27e8966189830a1 Sun Oct 16 13:39:00 2016\n. Not ideal as it involves setup but you can use https://github.com/etsy/hound thanks to @skevy at exponent:\n\ncreate a directory to hold your hound configuration and data\ncreate a config.json directory with your repostories\nrun hound\nInstall https://github.com/exponent/nuclide-hound-provider (with https://github.com/exponent/nuclide-hound-provider/pull/1 unless you work at exponent)\n\nExample for (2): https://github.com/etsy/hound/blob/master/config-example.json\nMy full example for 2 & 3:\nFreds-Mac-Pro:hound fred$ cat config.json\n{\n    \"max-concurrent-indexers\" : 2,\n    \"dbpath\" : \"/data\",\n    \"repos\" : {\n        \"HackCodegen\" : {\n          \"url\" : \"file:///Users/fred/hackdev/hack-codegen\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nFreds-Mac-Pro:hound fred$ docker run -d -p 6080:6080 --name hound -v $(pwd):/data -v /Users/fred/hackdev/:/Users/fred/hackdev etsy/hound\nThis gets me:\n\n. Still broken in nuclide@0.200.0. This was fixed by ccec96c1c629aa8931df74f2929aa9faaeaa383a. Workaround:\n\ndisable the built-in provider (optionally just for .php/.hh files) in autocomplete-plus settings; leave autocomplete-plus as a whole enabled. Nuclide's Hack support includes an alternative Hack provider\ndisable the autocomplete-snippets package. This one is a bit over-eager about inserting 'where' blocks in the middle of things\n\nIt'd be nice not to have to do this out of the box :/. This should probably be filed against HHVM, as this useshh_client --format, which:\n - has no configuration\n - is unsupported (both externally and within FB)\nIIRC the plan is to make a complete replacement once @ericlippert's work on the full fidelity parser is complete. hh_client --format for code that doesn't use recent Hack features (the amount of code this works for is rapidly shrinking), manual for everything else until the new thing is done.. An FB-free option would be to extend https://github.com/phplang/phack to fully support parsing Hack (as well as the transpilation stuff, it contains an extended nikic/php-parser), then either address https://github.com/phplang/phack/issues/7 or build a separate printer on top of that AST.\nThe work needed on the parser is pretty much stuff not marked 'Alpha' in the table in Phack's README. @jesseschalken : ymmv - https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/754e6f649384ccdb6039bfb879726aa1e809917c/hphp/hack/src/hackfmt.ml. hardcoded - but that's the new thing, so might get fixed :)\nAIUI this should be an issue against hack, as it'll still end up talking to the typechecker server; a fix would probalby involve the options going into .hhconfig.. https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/hack/src/hackfmt/hack_format.ml#L217 < reference for hardcoding. @ssandler: you can experiment with this by:\nbrew unlink hhvm\nbrew install hhvm/hhvm-preview\nThen change getUseLspConnection() in ~/.atom/packages/nuclide/pkg/nuclide-hack/lib/HackLanguage.js to always return true (or Promise(true) depending on what version of nuclide you have)\nWe now have homebrew binaries for high sierra, but not sierra, so if you've not upgraded that'll be a slow build-from-source. I'll try to get sierra binaries/bottles up later today or tomorrow.. disable_optional_and_unknown_shape_fields in experimental_options will get you this - however, this is likely to give you other problems - e.g. dependencies that target 3.23+ may not be usable with this set.. I'm getting this with both the default Hack integration, and when force-enabling LSP support for Hack. Also, I'm pretty sure this is a regression; I remember errors being sorted the way I expect in the past.. The last option sounds more complicated than needed; doesn't replacing the core algorithm with a stable sort basically solve this?. Good point, you're right - memory is needed.. @matthewwithanm \ud83d\udc4b . cc @ljw1004 . Can still reproduce:\n```\nfredemmott-pro:hhast fredemmott$ apm ls --installed\nCommunity Packages (3) /Users/fredemmott/.atom/packages\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ex-mode@0.18.0\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 nuclide@0.273.0\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 vim-mode-plus@1.25.1\nfredemmott-pro:hhast fredemmott$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.23.2\nElectron: 1.6.15\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\nNode    : 7.4.0\n```\nThis appears to be a Nuclide issue: I can't reproduce with vscode-hack+LSP or vim+LSP. Still able to reproduce with nuclide master, hh_client 3.24, all other plugins uninstalled, and ~/.atom/config.cson deleted. Despite being nuclide-specific, this appears to be fixed in the current nightly HHVM builds - at least for remote development.. Fix bisects to https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/7e8613ff04173fc62e08c58b60c405f4bfd9bb16. ",

As a workaround, you can replace ' with {\"'\"} -- lots of Facebook's frontend code does this since historically we just used PHP syntax highlighting which had the same problem.\n(Hopefully Nuclide can actually fix this properly once and for all though! :D)\n.

What was the result of which flow on your system before you moved it? If it's on your PATH, we should be finding it here.\nI'm glad you found a workaround. Another possible workaround is to simply set the path to flow in the settings for the nuclide-flow package.\n. .bashrc is only run when you start bash. Any changes it makes to the PATH variable only affect that shell and the processes that it spawns. So, if you start Atom from outside the command line, it will not pick up on any changes to the PATH that you have made in your .bashrc. That means it won't look in the location where you have installed Flow.\nThere are a couple solutions for this:\n- Install Flow to a typical location (you discovered this).\n- Go into the settings for the nuclide-flow package and specify the absolute path to the Flow binary.\nI will test and make sure that this theory is correct, and then I will update the documentation to include this information.\n. It should work with JavaScript. However, it only works for definitions that Flow knows about, so if you have Flow errors in your code it might cause problems with click-to-symbol. Also, Flow's click-to-symbol is currently pretty slow, so you might have to be patient.\n91 might be the root cause, also.\n. Interesting, I have also observed that error in my console but click-to-symbol still works for me and I can't consistently reproduce it. I will investigate further, and thanks for reporting.\n. @benjamindulau: I believe Flow v0.12.0 included a fix for the End_of_file issue. Here are the relevant commits:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flow/commit/b1290009fadd8fed96778abb73404b61fe41e919\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flow/commit/5406013aa8527de815ab0015fa4b6533f7464391\nI'm going to close this, but if anybody can reproduce this issue with Flow v0.12.0, please re-open and provide repro steps.\n. @gunn: if I understand correctly, in the bottom right instead of saying JavaScript it said Babel ES6 JavaScript because of the syntax highlighting provided by language-babel? And to get it working, you had to change the language to JavaScript? If so, that should be a pretty easy fix.\n. Thanks for letting us know; I will work on this.\n. @gunn: This should be fixed by 9648b729a676ae803ae2718befcd76617bec8fb4\n. > atom will display the check message but the behaviour still not like demo what was shown in official site\nCan you clarify? Does it display Flow errors, but differently than the screenshots, or does it not display them at all? If it doesn't display them at all, this might be related to #91.\n. @Saviio: Thank you for the detailed comment. There are a couple things going on here:\n- On Monday we moved from linter to linter-plus, which accounts for the difference in UI. Unfortunately the Flow docs were not updated along with this change. That would also explain why it didn't work at all without the linter-plus package. CC @oclbdk -- should linting work without the linter-plus package? If not, should we update the documentation and make sure that linter-plus is installed?\n- Click-to-define not working is being tracked in #92.\n. I'm going to close this since it looks like these are the only two issues here.\n. This looks good to me; I've imported it for internal review.\n. We've merged this. It will show up next time we export commits. Thank you for contributing!\n. There's been a lot of churn with the linters lately. I'm inclined to wait a few days and revisit this if it is still a problem.\n. I can no longer repro this on the latest source version of Nuclide. I assume it's been fixed in the linter package. Please reopen if you still have this problem when using the source version of Nuclide.\n. Can you clarify where that output appears? Is it in the output from flow server?\nWhich parts of flow \"do not work\" in Atom? This seems like it's related to autocomplete -- do Flow errors appear in the editor?\nWhat do you mean by \"everything works as expected?\" What commands are you running from the command line? And what version of Flow do you have?\n. Interesting, I will see if I can reproduce. A couple more questions -- what distro/version of Linux are you running? And can you give me the output of flow --version? There was just a new release yesterday so I want to make sure you're on the latest version.\n. Thanks for the report; I will check this out.\n. I'm interested in the\n\nFailure(\"Couldn't parse file\")\n\nlines. @pluma, thanks for posting a detailed repro case. I will try it out. This sounds like it may be an issue with Flow itself, in which case I'll file a bug with them.\n@nmn, if you have trouble with Flow from the command line, then you can file an issue directly with https://github.com/facebook/flow . If you do, I would appreciate it if you CC me or refer to this issue.\n. @pluma: Thanks again for the detailed repro instructions. I can reproduce your issue. If I disable the \"Lint on Fly\" option in the linter package, the issue goes away (but then you have to save to get errors). It looks like we don't send the current file contents to Flow when linting on the fly, which is obviously wrong. I'll fix that.\n@sauerman: I think the autocomplete errors you're getting are a separate issue. It looks similar to an issue with type hints that the Flow team just fixed. I suspect that the reason you aren't getting those errors when running from the terminal is just that you aren't querying Flow for autocomplete suggestions when you run it from the terminal. Do click-to-definition and typehints work for you? If so, I think you're experiencing the same issue as everyone else in the thread.\n@nmn I haven't experienced the issue with Atom Helper pegging the CPU. How do you know it was nuclide-flow causing that? Are other nuclide-flow features working, or is it just linting that's broken? If you disable \"Lint on Fly\" does linting start working? I hope that we can soon get to the level of quality where you won't feel the need to maintain your own linter package :)\n. @nmn Yes, lint on fly is broken but I will have a fix for it shortly. Yes, we've been meaning to expose those errors more intelligently but haven't gotten around to it. A PR for that would definitely be welcome.\nI'm not sure why autocomplete and typehints aren't working; I've never had any issues with them even when I was using my Fedora machine to try to reproduce these issues. @nmn or @sauerman, Are you getting any errors in the developer console?\n. Don't bother with on the fly linting, I've already got that being reviewed internally.\nThanks for clarifying about autocomplete. Yes, the results leave something to be desired. I haven't personally looked into it, but I have observed it.\nNot sure why typehints aren't working. I added them pretty recently; I wonder if you have that version of nuclide-flow? Check in the nuclide-flow settings for an \"enable type hints\" option. If it's not there it just means you don't have that version.\n. I think the only unresolved issue here is the autocomplete priority. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n@nmn, it sounds like you still haven't gotten type hints working -- did you double-check that you have the \"enable type hints\" option in nuclide-flow, and that the box is checked?\n. Nuclide is intended to be used with all of its packages installed; using it piecemeal is not supported. If you followed the installation instructions (running the setup script if you're developing from source, installing nuclide-installer if you are not), you should have gotten all of the Nuclide packages, including nuclide-type-hint.\n. Nuclide v0.31 fixed Flow autocomoplete. I think we're all set here.\n. Hey, this is a pretty old issue -- could you open a new one? CC me so the response is quicker.\nIt's hard to say what's going wrong here without more details. The most likely thing I can think of is that Nuclide isn't finding the Flow binary. You can go to the nuclide-flow section in the nuclide settings and specify the path to the Flow binary. See if that helps. If not there are some other things we can try.\nI have some work planned to make it more obvious why results aren't appearing in various cases. We have to balance making it clear why Flow isn't working against not annoying people who don't want to use it. Right now I think we are too far towards the latter.\n. There is an option in the nuclide-flow package to disable typehints.\nAdmittedly, the typehints UI could also use some work, but hopefully that option is enough to keep you productive for now.\n. Just to update you on this -- we are planning to display type hints as trees. If you are interested you can check out dd74d1830767a5e9be55d7a01243c2d0004149f0, where I added the ability for Flow type hints to be structured as a tree. @jgebhardt is planning to do the UI to make these trees navigable when he gets a chance.\nOnce we have this done, large type hints will start out small, but you will be able to navigate through them if you like. I think this will provide the level of detail we want without getting in the way.\n. Addressed by some recent UI work. Thanks, checking this out.\n. Additionally, apm test fails. Please make sure all tests pass and make sure that Flow errors actually appear in the editor.\n. Thanks for the updates. I probably won't have a chance to review this today, so it will likely wait until Monday.\nThanks also for setting up an .eslintrc. We actually already have linting set up internally, it just hasn't made it to the GitHub repository. It's probably trivial but it just has to be done. I'll do it next week.\n. This looks good to me! Thanks!\nI have to get a second opinion before merging. You should hear back by Monday or Tuesday.\n. @nmn: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/11401bc407d6d089f17577c8a707d4ca16e67929, which enables on-the-fly linting, is already landed.\n. We merged this with a couple more minor style changes. It should be out soon! Thanks for contributing!\n. Is this what you mean?\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/9648b729a676ae803ae2718befcd76617bec8fb4\n. See also https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/92#issuecomment-116875416\n. Flow from the command line doesn't warn me about that either. If you think that's incorrect then file an issue against https://github.com/facebook/flow. If jump to definition works then it's a good indicator that our Flow integration is working.\n. It appears that files with a jsx extension don't get labeled as JavaScript files by Nuclide (something that should get fixed), but I tried this example and once I selected JavaScript as the language, Flow features started working for me.\n. It looks like https://github.com/atom/language-javascript is the package that provides JavaScript syntax highlighting, perhaps filing an issue with them to add \"jsx\" to the list of extensions would be worthwhile.\n. You could create a pull request to add other grammars here:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/flow/lib/constants.js#L13\nSo if you do have a package installed that provides syntax highlighting for jsx files, but uses a different scope name, adding it there should enable nuclide-flow to work.\n. You need /* @flow */ at the top of your files for Flow to understand them. If you don't have that, some Flow features will work on a best-effort basis but it will not be reliable.\n. And I'm not sure whether Flow will look for .jsx files, also.\n. I just tried your example and Flow does in fact support .jsx files. The problem is that you have a syntax error in itNot.js, so Flow cannot find that module. However, it's not getting reported because you don't have /* @flow */ at the top.\n. I see. I'm not familiar with that syntax but Flow does not recognize it. I suggest you file an issue with Flow regarding that.\n. I've never seen a problem with it. Could you provide a bit more context? Is it possible that you could narrow down the specific type hint provider that seems to be causing you trouble (e.g. hack if you are editing hack code).\n. Could you explain what evidence you have that suggests nuclide-type-hints is to blame?\n. OK, I'm going to close this but if you can provide more details (like a CPU trace) feel free to re-open.\n. Have you tried running the entire path from the command line?\n./home/dlaird/node-v0.12.7-linux-x64/bin/node_modules/nuclide-server/nuclide-start-server\nThe leading . looks suspicious to me. I would try removing that from the 'Connect' dialog box.\n. This should be fixed as of a922cd3142254d2bc52acf17206f2cc819c71ff3.\nIf you are using a development version of Nuclide, please pull. If not, this should be fixed in the next release. Please re-open the issue if this problem persists.\n. Should be fixed by a922cd3142254d2bc52acf17206f2cc819c71ff3\n. I will look into this.\n. As @bolinfest says, this should just work. What do you mean by \"that seems to be the only ESLint package that you can install?\"\nI will see if I can repro using linter-eslint.\n. Unfortunately it looks like linter-eslint simply does not start if the linter package is not there. We can't control the behavior of other packages, but I've filed an issue against the linter-eslint package asking them to reconsider this requirement.\n. @admmasters Note that in the mean time, you can actually enable the linter package, ignore our warning, and have both UIs displaying messages. You can even go to the settings for nuclide-diagnostics-store and tell it not to consume diagnostics from packages using the linter API. That way you won't see duplicate diagnostic messages. The ones using our API (Flow, Hack) will still show up in our UI, and everything else will still show up in the linter UI.\nThis isn't ideal but it might be better than missing out on ESLint issues entirely.\n. Should be fixed in ff151885b2569032f315ab93a441e78bd855dc1a\n. I've also experienced this happening sporadically since sometime late last week (around the time Flow v0.15.0 was released). My current theory is that we are hitting a race condition where Flow does not have updated results when we query it, but I haven't verified that theory.\nIn any case, it's high on my list of things to work on. I'll post updates here with progress. In the mean time, sorry for the inconvenience.\n. I've ruled out several potential causes but haven't yet figured out exactly what's going wrong.\n. It turns out that my initial hypothesis was correct, but I incorrectly ruled it out -- Flow hasn't picked up on the fact that the file has been saved by the time that we call it and ask for results.\nThe solution is either to figure out how to make sure that Flow wins the race, or re-architect so that there isn't a race at all. Long term I think we need to do the latter.\nCC @gabelevi from the Flow team who I have been working with.\n. Unfortunately we had to revert the fix because it was mysteriously causing timeouts in our integration tests. We'll investigate and revisit.\n. Thanks for reporting. We are looking into this.\n. Fixed by the unified package: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. Fixed by 132c97d1dd1c07e45a9a0273deba3c6ed8f56796\n. Sorry about that. Do you have .flowconfig files in the projects you are editing? If not, Flow shouldn't run at all. If you do, I would expect 10-15 Flow processes (Flow starts worker processes), but I wouldn't expect that kind of CPU usage, let alone a crashed MBP. I use this every day to develop Nuclide and don't experience anything like that.\nWhat happens when you navigate to that project and run flow server from the command line? If causes the same problem, file an issue with Flow. If not, it's a problem with Nuclide.\nI do have some work planned to reduce the number of requests we send to Flow. Currently we spawn quite a few more processes than we need in certain instances, which could be contributing to the problems here.\nCould you also share some details about the projects you're working on? Even if they are very large, I wouldn't expect this sort of problem. If they are open-source, though, I could try to reproduce on that specific codebase. Also, what version of Flow and Nuclide do you have?\n. @h3l To confirm, your issue was just that Flow wasn't working, correct? I find it hard to believe that you had Flow processes eating up all your CPU and crashing your computer if you never installed Flow.\n. @oguzbilgic Could you provide the other details I requested?\n@h3l That is a separate issue, please see https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/199.\n. @kagha That is a separate issue, please see #199. It is expected to have 10-15 Flow processes idling while you are working. Flow keeps a server running so that it can quickly answer queries, and that server spawns some worker processes.\n. > [2016-01-26T16:20:05.186Z] [ERROR] nuclide - Problem parsing type hint: Kind AnyFunT not supported\nThat's unrelated -- it's due to the experimental \"enable structured type hints\" setting being checked. I haven't implemented structured type hints for all types yet (one of the reasons it's labeled experimental) so for some it will log these errors. The UI for that was either just released or will be in the next release (don't remember off hand), so some types will be expandable trees.\nI think the best thing you could do is get the output of ps -eaf | grep flow when you're experiencing this issue.\nTo be clear, it's expected that Flow will consume a lot of CPU when it first starts up. On the Nuclide codebase it takes in the ballpark of 30 seconds. Then, whenever you save it has to recompute some information. In large projects I've seen this take as long as maybe 5 seconds. However it should only be the Flow worker processes consuming any significant amount of CPU (10-15 of them, maybe). We've seen a few cases where the Flow client processes also consume CPU which is weird and can lead to your system locking up. The ps command above should help us figure out if that's what's happening.\n. That memory usage is absurd. If you can reproduce please report on the Flow repository.\n. Somebody internal just put together a diff that fixes this, so I'm going to close this pull request. Thanks for taking the time to put it up, though!\nRegarding the * dep -- firstly, 'text-buffer' actually isn't needed, since we can just require('atom') to get Range. Anyway, we want to control our dependencies well and since we don't use npm shrinkwrap across the board yet we can at least get part of the way by hardcoding version numbers. That way we at least get known versions of our direct dependencies whenever we npm install.\n. Fixed by the unified package: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. - It's not documented on the API Wiki. This is actually the first I've heard of this. I don't know if it's a recent feature, or if it has been around for a while, but I didn't know about it.\n- I wanted something that I could implement in our LinterAdapter without interfering with the current linter API. Because this either did not exist at the time, or I just didn't know about it, we couldn't modify the functionality of existing properties and maintain compatibility.\n- Generally I don't like mixing unrelated concepts. The grammarScopes array is an array of grammar scopes. Introducing a special value that can go in there but is not a grammar scope can become confusing. Even if the API is clear, it's easy to forget that there is a special value that you need to handle differently, and if you add to many such special values it will quickly become a mess. In contrast, it is immediately obvious that a separate property is something different, both to the consumer and producer of the API.\n. This is a strange error. I've occasionally seen my repository get into a weird state that breaks the setup script (usually in some npm call like this), and cleaning out the repository does the trick.\nAssuming you don't have any uncommitted work in the Nuclide repository that you care about, run git clean -xfd and see if that clears up the issue. Since you ran the setup script with sudo, you may have to run this command with sudo. After that, don't use sudo for the setup script -- it's not necessary.\n. I just tried with npm 3.3 and 3.4, and neither worked. I downgraded npm to 2.0.2 (with node still on v5.0.0), and the script worked.\nWe will settle on canonical versions and make sure that they are clearly documented. In the mean time, try using the versions above when setting up Nuclide.\n. Looks like the symbols-tree-view package does not include a providerName property. Uninstall that package or see if the author will add it so it is compatible with the latest Nuclide.\n. This sounds plausible, and we should have been more careful when changing this API. We definitely should have bumped the API version, and probably should have thought more carefully about whether to make this mandatory. It's used only to gather performance data from our internal users, so it doesn't even have an affect on users outside of Facebook. I think that's a good case for making it optional.\nI'll likely just make it optional but a PR would help move things along :)\n. No. Our move to the unified package deprecates all of the individual Nuclide packages, including hyperclick. There is some interest in splitting hyperclick out again and possibly attempting to get it included with Atom but at the moment we have no concrete plans.\nCurrently we recommend that you install the nuclide package. If you truly only want hyperclick you can disable the other parts of Nuclide, although we are primarily interested in supporting people who want to use Nuclide as a whole.\n. Yeah, like I said we've been musing for quite a while about getting it bundled with Atom but nobody has made the time to push it forward. We'd still like to do it, it's just not a top priority at the moment. There was a PR against Atom a while back where the Atom team outlined what would need to get done:\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6843\nSince the unified package transition hyperclick has become a little bit more rooted within Nuclide. It would require some effort to tear it out but it's certainly tractable.\nCC @joefitzgerald who I have also chatted with about this.\n. Am I correct in assuming that strip_root is just meant to increase readability for humans? If so, I think the right fix would be to have Flow print full paths when --json is passed, even if strip_root is set to true? What do you think?\n. Maybe the Flow docs should be updated to recommend against using strip_root? In any case, I don't think there is anything actionable here for Nuclide so I'm closing this out.\n. Yeah, I think that exposing this via a setting would be reasonable, but I agree that the current behavior is desirable. The documentation should be updated to include the OS X behavior, though.\nThere is an Atom issue (https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7595) for deactivating multiple cursors. If we had our way, multiple cursors would move to a different keybinding and no longer conflict.\n. (We don't currently expose it as a setting but I would happily review a PR that did)\n. Fixed by the unified package: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. @markmiro Does this happen on any remote file, or just JavaScript?\n@scv119 this looks like an error in the generated service framework code. Any ideas?\n. @scv119 has a better understanding of the installation process and may be able to provide more details, but from what I understand, our dependencies simply don't get deduped. So, we have a number of nuclide-* Atom packages, and each one depends on a lot of npm packages (for example, nuclide-commons). Because of the way packages get installed in Atom, each one of these packages pulls down its own copies of all of its transitive dependencies. This means that in essence, our nuclide-commons package and any other packages that are frequently-depended-on have a complete install for every nuclide-* apm package. This adds a lot of bloat and results in what you are seeing.\nWe need some way to avoid installing duplicate dependencies. @zertosh is looking in to options here, I believe.\nSo the good news is that this is a solvable problem, and not something inherent to Nuclide. The bad news is that we haven't solved it yet :disappointed:\n. Fixed by the unified package: http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package\n. @scv119 I don't think that's the right Atom PR\n. It's going to take another release. See my comments on #251 for an explanation about the long delay since the last release. We were hoping to hold off until we get the huge install size and bad performance fixed, but this issue might warrant a release anyway.\nI know this isn't a great answer, but you can always build from source. The way our setup script works alleviates some of the performance and size problems with the released version. And, you'll pick up this fix immediately.\n. Don't quote me on this, but there has been talk of doing one today. I'm not sure if it will happen or not. If not, it's likely to be sometime next week.\n. It is highly unlikely that we will move away from Node. We also have native dependencies and I'm not optimistic that they will all compile properly for a different architecture. This is not going to happen, at least not in the near future.\n. Duplicate of #246 \n. v0.0.32 is the latest version of our Atom packages. v0.0.34 was a release of only our npm packages, as described in the changelog.\n. For context: The reason we haven't done an Atom release in a while is because of issues like #239 -- basically, the number of packages we install doesn't work well with Atom's installation model, and it seriously damages performance. @zertosh is working on some massive changes to fix that, but in the mean time, since the number of packages is only increasing, and the ones we have are only getting larger, we don't want to do a release and cause even more performance problems.\nI wanted to release npm packages because flow-for-vscode (which I just threw together with @bpasero) depends on nuclide-flow-base. I wanted to use a more up-to-date version of that.\n. Yep, should be fixed by the unified package.\n. I'm inclined to approve this. We don't exclude lower priority results for our Flow autocomplete provider and personally I think it's fine. @mostafaeweda, What was the original rationale for excluding lower priority results? Will something go wrong if we land this?\n. Can you provide some information on how you installed Nuclide? We haven't done a release with the single package yet so you must have cloned from GitHub, right? Did you follow the instructions at the README and run npm install?\n. I'm assuming you do in fact have Flow installed, and you get autocomplete elsewhere. What you describe does not sound like something that Flow autocomplete currently supports. You could open an issue on the Flow repository to request more autocomplete.\n. I have seen this message only when the client and server versions are inconsistent. Are you sure that both are on the same version?\n. I just got this too. I closed the settings panel (with the nuclide package settings showing) using cmd+w. I didn't do any resizing, although I do have a split pane with outline view on the right.\nBut, I can't reproduce it.\nError: Undefined screen line when clipping screen position                       \n  at DisplayBuffer.module.exports.DisplayBuffer.clipScreenPosition (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/display-buffer.js:874:15)\n  at DisplayBuffer.module.exports.DisplayBuffer.bufferPositionForScreenPosition (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/display-buffer.js:826:20)\n  at TextEditor.module.exports.TextEditor.bufferPositionForScreenPosition (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/text-editor.js:1283:33)\n  at HyperclickForTextEditor._getMousePositionAsBufferPosition (.../Nuclide/pkg/nuclide/hyperclick/lib/HyperclickForTextEditor.js:266:31)\n  at HyperclickForTextEditor._isMouseAtLastWordRange (.../Nuclide/pkg/nuclide/hyperclick/lib/HyperclickForTextEditor.js:286:43)\n  at HyperclickForTextEditor._onMouseMove (.../Nuclide/pkg/nuclide/hyperclick/lib/HyperclickForTextEditor.js:147:16)\n. CC @jgebhardt, @mostafaeweda, @cbosuna\n. Feel free to reopen if more work is done here\n. We have actually already done the file restructuring you hint at. It's briefly explained in the README. Basically it is now only a single package. The individual nuclide-* packages, including nuclide-installer, will be shortly deprecated. We are working out the final kinks and we expect to have a release out soon. In the mean time you can install from source if you wish.\nThe problems are the same on Mac OS X and Linux, but I believe they are exacerbated in Windows.\n. Personally I quite like the fuzzy matching, but perhaps it would be worth modifying it to favor results where the matched characters are early in the string. That way, results that start with the first character would be at the top but other results would still be available. Would that satisfy you?\n. I understand what you were asking for and I also read the original issue. But the problem with my proposal in this case isn't that you are having trouble selecting the right Flow result, but that the Flow results are preventing you from selecting a result from another provider.\nAlthough \"There are always strings in my open files whose middle section fuzzy matches these\" makes me think that it might not be the Flow provider after all: Flow doesn't just take strings from your open files, it only displays results relevant to your current context. Maybe you could post a screenshot and it would help me understand what exactly is going wrong?\n. Only one report, no repro steps, and happened quite a while ago. Closing.\n. Weird, cmd+P actually works fine for me. CC @jgebhardt \n. I just looked and for Facebook-internal users we override cmd+P to trigger quick-open. We didn't do that for external users, presumably so that we don't mess with existing workflows too much. So the docs should be updated.\n. The current consensus among the team is that we don't want to do this. Even if we did, it would probably be nontrivial and it would be hard to justify the effort right now.\nYou can always disable and enable the Nuclide package when you want to switch back and forth.\n. One thing that stands out is the fact that you have a package named blame. I wonder if this is triggering a weird issue with our unified package code that loads the individual Atom \"packages.\" Can you try removing the blame package and checking whether this issue persists?\n. Makes sense. Assuming it's not realistic to remove that assumption from Atom, this is a pretty convincing argument for flattening our directory structure.\n. I recently added a popup that appears once per Nuclide run if you have a project with a .flowconfig but the Flow binary cannot be located, but that went out two weeks ago. In any case it's expected behavior now, and shows that at least some of Nuclide is working. For the other issue, I don't know if it's a Nuclide problem but it may be worth opening another issue with a screenshot.\n. Thanks for the detailed bug report, but we don't currently support Windows. We are hoping to work out the kinks in the near future but for now you'll be best off returning to Arch if you want to use Nuclide.\n. For now I don't think it's useful to get bug reports on Windows since we won't act on them at the moment, and either way, obvious things like this problem will be one of the first things solved when we do start working on Windows support.\nHowever we would be thrilled to accept contributions to improve Windows support. It's definitely something we want to do, we just haven't prioritized it yet.\n. We don't currently support Windows. The unified package was a step forward but we still have some kinks to work out. Dup of #314\n. For context, @kyldvs is not actually on the Nuclide team and contributed this feature in his spare time.\n. The width of the gutter isn't ideal, but I'm not extremely surprised by this. The line numbers alone take up a constant width throughout the file, so if you have a file with three digit (or even four digit) line numbers, the gutter will look more compact once you scroll down. That's pretty much unavoidable. \nHowever it looks like nuclide-debugger may not be removing its gutter space when it's disabled. Could you confirm that you have disabled the nuclide-debugger-atom feature?\nCould you use the dev tools to see which gutter elements you have, and their widths? There should be a div with the class gutter-container. For each child, could you include its gutter-name and its width?\n. We use these features extensively while developing Nuclide itself and I haven't encountered anything like this. Could you paste your ~/.atom/config.cson? I'm thinking you might have \"Diagnostics as you type\" enabled, which is currently labeled experimental because it has some quirks like this.\n. No problem. Getting this to work properly is yet another item on my long to do list :smile:\n. Thanks! This is fine. I wish I could justify spending more time on this package. I'd love to have really good OCaml support but we just don't have enough people writing OCaml to justify working on this over other things. If you're keen on spending some time here there is a lot of low hanging fruit.\n. Just saw this -- unfortunately Nuclide is pretty silent if Flow is not found, since I didn't want to bother people who don't have any interest in using it. However, I think it would make more sense to first check for a .flowconfig and if it is there, throw up a warning if it cannot find Flow.\nIn the short term, all I can recommend is:\n1. Make sure that .flowconfig exists at the root of your remote project, and that your files start with /* @flow */.\n2. Make sure that flow is on your PATH on your remote machine. (try which flow or flow version).\n3. If those don't work, see if there is anything interesting in your devtools console in Atom.\n. I've since improved a few things here. Now we pop up a warning if Nuclide can't locate the Flow binary, but we do locate a .flowconfig file. I also fixed a bug that could sometime prevent Flow errors from appearing from a remote connection.\n. Is Flow installed on your remote server? The popup just tells you to install Flow, it doesn't install it for you.\n. Unfortunately the \"path to flow\" setting only works locally. We've been meaning to figure out a scheme for per-server config (which is what it would take to do this right) but haven't.\nI bet the path to ~.npm_packages/bin isn't making it onto the PATH variable that the nuclide-server ends up with.\nOne thing that may help here is to enable the setting to allow Nuclide to use the project-local flow-bin.  Since you have flow-bin installed in your project folder that should work. Unfortunately we can't make this the default due to security concerns.\n. Yeah, I'm guessing that the nuclide server wasn't picking up all the PATH changes in your .bashrc. I'm not sure about the specifics but I do know that it doesn't run quite like a normal shell.\n. I'm pretty sure this won't work if you are using Merlin over a remote connection. The service framework will try to serialize the Merlin Process and will probably fail. I'll merge this provided that:\n- You add a comment noting that this will not work remotely and is only for local prototyping. Committed code should not use this function.\n- You test to make sure that the existing features still work remotely. I'm pretty sure that the service framework won't choke on this definition but it has bitten me before.\nLastly, thanks for hacking on this! I really want our OCaml tooling to be better but haven't found the time to improve it. I'm hoping this is a sign that there are more contributions to come :smile: \n. Thanks for the detailed info. Just want to confirm that you mean flow get-def, not flow type-at-pos.\n. type-at-pos is unrelated to click to definition. It just returns the type of the thing at the given position. Nuclide's click-to-symbol is backed by get-def, so it would make more sense to investigate whether get-def returns what you expect.\n. This slipped through the cracks, sorry. Just found it again while triaging another report. This is indeed an issue with Flow. Please report it on https://github.com/facebook/flow if you would like to follow up.\n. Nevermind, it turns out that it's fixed in Flow master and the fix will be released with Flow v0.31.0.\n. Please reopen on the Flow repository. We simply display the data they give us.\n. It is a Flow problem. I've had lots of discussions with them about error position issues. I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at when you say the \"correct wrong line number\" but I assume you're pointing out that line 39 is correctly displayed in the box? Flow can give us several different positions for a single error so that we can display the context in this box. However, there is no reasonable way for Nuclide to figure out which of the (in this case three) positions to actually put the error at. So, we just use the position associated with the first line.\nThe Flow team has taken responsibility for putting good positions on the first line of each error message. They have fixed this type of thing in the past.\nOh, and your next question might be \"If I run Flow from the command line, the correct position appears on the first line, so doesn't that mean it's a Nuclide problem?\" That's because Flow displays errors differently in human-readable form and JSON form (which is what we consume). It's not quite as simple as changing the JSON output to match the human-readable output, since often the first line in the human-readable output is not actually the location you would expect. These things need to be handled by the Flow team on a case-by-case basis.\nHopefully this clears things up.\n. Exactly -- I'm not disputing that it is an issue. I'm just explaining why it's an issue with Flow, not Nuclide.\n. I think that as long as you have a .flowconfig, then Flow's jump to definition will work on a best-effort basis even for files without /* @flow */. Without type annotations, of course, it's not always possible to resolve the definition for a symbol but for simple cases like your example it should work.\nThat's not really a supported use-case, though. We are primarily interested in supporting JavaScript projects that do use Flow.\n. I just pushed v0.120.0 which includes this fix.\n. I tried to repro and ran into https://github.com/santip/move-panes/issues/2. That plugin doesn't appear to be maintained (last commit was 8 months ago) so I don't think it's worth any effort to maintain compatibility.\n. @JoelMarcey I think we should make this clearer in the docs.\n@mostafaeweda Let's pop up a clear warning if watchman isn't installed, explaining the implications and how to install it.\n. Dup of #331\n. I just pushed v0.120.0 which includes this fix.\n. Could you add a screenshot? I think it would help us understand what's going on.\n. Sorry for the delay in responding. Basically, you have a package installed the the Nuclide diagnostics package is not compatible with. I should improve the error message here to include the name of the package.\nThis error, specifically, I think is just a case of diagnostics being overly conservative. When I implemented this validation I wasn't sure what it would mean to have a project-level linter that could lint as you type, so I disallowed it. We could probably relax this restriction, though.\nAnyway, this will only affect results from the one package that is triggering this error. It's almost certainly one of the linter- packages. If you like you could also go in to the Nuclide settings and disable the nuclide-diagnostics-* features and just use the linter package to display issues. You won't get Flow issues through nuclide-flow anymore, but it looks like you're using the linter-flow package which is compatible with linter.\n. I think the validation just has to be relaxed. Removing this if block should do it. Anyone want to put up a PR?\n. I described what I think is the proper fix in my last comment. Feel free to put up a PR.\n. That sounds like a separate issue. If they are doing something too weird we won't bend over backwards to support it but if there's an obvious incompatibility with the linter API that should be fixed. In any case we'll need a separate issue with more details.\n. Overall looks fine to me. I don't have an opinion about shell quoting so I will leave the rest to @zertosh.\n. @jordwalke @ssorallen are either of you planning on driving this through?\n. @yunxing if you rebase one more time I will drive this through. Sorry that we dropped the ball on this PR.\n. I'm still happy to make sure this gets in if you update. Feel free to reopen or create a new PR.\n. Hey, it would be better to file this issue on the Flow repository as it's not specific to Nuclide and they know more about the intricacies involved.\nI do know that they have plans to make it easy to manage 3rd party library type definitions but unfortunately it's not currently very simple.\n. Thank you for providing more details. However this still appears to me to be a bug with Flow. We get all our autocomplete and type hint information directly from Flow so I do not believe this is a bug with Nuclide. Please file a task on the Flow repository.\n. Closing in favor of that issue.\n. Yep, there are a bunch of different things that I'm planning to support with outline view in the near future but I wanted to get an initial working version off the ground ASAP. I'll probably get to this in the next two weeks.\n. exports.foo =..., module.exports = { ... }, and maybe top-level constants are some of the others.\n. See also #437 for a few other things I want to support, if you are feeling inspired to keep working on this.\nI'm not totally sure how I feel about displaying the equals sign but I'm willing to land it and see how it works in practice.\nUpdate the tests and I'll merge.\n. @facebook-github-bot import\n. I made two minor tweaks -- removed trailing whitespace to pass lint, and changed the test file to @noflow since it now has Flow errors. Those were both needed to pass the pre-commit tests and I didn't want to have another back-and-forth before landing.\nThanks for putting this together! Totally understand re: being busy. I just wanted to make you aware of the other plans in case you were interested.\n. Ah interesting, thanks for digging into this.\nIt looks like the linter API has changed a bit: https://github.com/steelbrain/linter/wiki/Linter-API\nA message used to have a type property that could be 'Error' or 'Warning', now it's severity, 'info' has been added, and the case has changed. This is kind of frustrating but I think one of the things we should do here is to add more validation to ensure that we are getting the data we expect from providers. We should pop up a red box if a provider gives us data we don't expect.\nIn this case we should settle on canonical values to use for various levels and make sure we get what we are expecting. We can consider relaxing things like case requirements but we should canonicalize before the message makes it very far into diagnostics.\n. However, linter-jscs uses type with lower-case error and warning so I don't think it ever complied with the published API. We still should handle cases like this better, though.\n. What is the output of hh_client --outline?\n. Ah sorry, yeah you need to pipe in the file contents. I'll look into this.\n. @peterhal I think you addressed this, right?\n. I can reproduce this on Flow v0.21.0 (haven't tried other versions).\nThis is almost certainly an issue with Flow itself. We get the autocomplete results directly from Flow. I get that the Flow typechecker correctly understands extends but the autocomplete that it provides is more rudimentary. Could you re-open this issue on the Flow repository?\n. You had all of the old nuclide-* packages from before we unified Nuclide into a single nuclide package, as well as the new nuclide package. It should have printed a warning explaining the issue, but in any case deleting those packages was the right thing to do and you should be all set now.\n. No, it shouldn't be exposed. Nuclide's .flowconfig is for the source code of Nuclide itself. It's not a .flowconfig that we apply to projects that end-users are working on. @ssorallen was just explaining that we have this same problem working on the Nuclide source, and explained what we have done to deal with it.\nThe Flow team has some plans to alleviate the node_modules problems. I'm not sure if there's an open issue but I do know they are working on this problem. Right now the setup is finicky, but @ssorallen is correct that the best solution is to edit your .flowconfig.\nUltimately this is an issue with Flow and not with Nuclide. Flow should only be reporting errors relevant to you and ignoring them from within Nuclide is only a bandaid.\n. Right. Nuclide won't run Flow if there is no .flowconfig. Flow itself also won't run even if you try to start it from the command line.\n. I can't repro. I made a directory with just a JS file and no .flowconfig and Flow does not start, and no Flow-related features are available (as expected). I also added a .flowconfig, observed that Nuclide started a Flow server, removed the .flowconfig, killed the Flow server, and verified that Nuclide did not start it back up again. I'm on master but this code really hasn't changed much at all recently.\nCan you share the output of ps -eaf | grep flow?\n. Note that Nuclide does cache the locations of .flowconfig files for 30 seconds so after removing the .flowconfig so I would expect Nuclide to try to start Flow for 30 seconds after you remove it, at most.\nThis is also puzzling because Flow itself refuses to start if it can't find a .flowconfig. I just tried running flow server and it just complained that there was no .flowconfig file.\n. And you're absolutely sure that /Users/brandon.dail/.flowconfig does not exist?\n. It just looks upward in the directory tree from the current file until it finds a .flowconfig. It does not treat any folder specially, including the user folder.\n. Yes, this is a problem with Nuclide diagnostics and not a compatibility issue with any other package. As a workaround you can check and then uncheck the \"show only diagnostics for the current file\" box which will force a refresh. I believe also that if you continue working, updates to the table will appear as expected.\n. You're on a very old version of Nuclide from back when we distributed it as many different packages. Please remove the nuclide-* packages and hyperclick and install the nuclide package.\nAlternatively, if you just install the nuclide package it should instruct you on how to remove the old packages on startup.\n. Please fill out the steps to reproduce or at least a little bit more context about what was going on when this happened.\n. If you see this happen again, please post the stack trace from the error message.\n. Hmm, well one thing is that this command is misnamed and there's no reason to use it unless the Flow server has actually crashed. I keep meaning to rename it to avoid confusion. But anyway, it still shouldn't cause an error.\nAnyway, I tried to reproduce just now and was unable to. Can you include more details about what you were doing prior to seeing this error? For example, what combination of local and remote (if any) folders did you have open? Had you added or removed any during the lifetime of the Atom process? If you restart Atom, can you reproduce? If so can you describe in more detail what you do from the time you open Atom to the time when you see this error?\n. We have the nuclide-code-format package which is language-agnostic. For some reason it doesn't appear that format-js is integrated with it. But anyway, that would be the right place to add format-on-save if we wanted it. Generally-speaking we want features like this to be language-agnostic and to have separate packages that plug in for each language.\nI'm not sure what the implementation would look like, though. We wouldn't want to block the file save on a potentially expensive and error-prone operation. Maybe we would save again after the results come back? However that comes with its own set of problems.\n. @matthewwithanm @tagpro: is this fixed now?\n. I agree that we should get rid of this error, but I don't think this is the right way to go about it. This is just a band-aid on top of the actual problem, which is Flow returning invalid JSON (I think due to a timeout? I haven't investigated but maybe increasing the number of retries or something would be a good fix). We shouldn't just silence the error, we should fix the root cause.\n. I understand that -- but the issue is that we end up with an empty string here in the first place. That shouldn't happen and it really does indicate a problem. It's unfortunate that this happens so often that it leads to console spam, but every time it happens it means there was a request that goes unfulfilled. We should fix the root cause rather than just silencing this message.\n. If you'd like to increase timeouts or retries I'll take another look but I don't believe ignoring this error is the right way to solve this.\n. Please reopen if this doesn't work.\n. @ssorallen looks like a problem with the source control sidebar\n. Try restarting. This looks like an issue with Atom's module cache being out of date across a Nuclide upgrade.\nBy the way, the flow package you have installed is not related to Facebook's Flow project.\n. Please include some context, e.g. repro steps, where this message appeared, etc.\n. Yes, this is definitely something we want to do. It's been inching higher on our priority list but we still have no concrete plans to make it happen. @peterhal wrote up an initial spec for this.\nSpecifically, though, we will probably require users to manually install the npm module on the remote server for two reasons: (1) we want to avoid avenues for remote code execution, and (2) a lot of things can go wrong with npm install that we don't want to have to account for in our UI.\n. Yes, but we don't want to make it any worse than it already is \ud83d\ude04 And we certainly don't want to build something that is inherently insecure by design when there is a reasonable alternative.\nFor the same reason, we won't be bundling something that allows arbitrary remote commands to be executed, like you're suggesting, but if somebody used this interface to create a third party package that did that, we couldn't stop them.\n. As long as you understand that this should not be considered a stable API...\n. Not currently, but we have been wanting to develop at least some rudimentary Java support for some time. At the very least, it could help people who normally use Nuclide for other languages but are browsing or making small changes to Java code. We don't currently have plans to work on Java support but it is certainly on our wishlist.\n. @zertosh wrote something (which will be out in the next release) that will make Nuclide refuse to start after an upgrade until Atom is restarted. That should solve all these module cache issues.\n. Looks like a dup of #518. I know the title isn't the same but I believe it's the same root cause.\n. Could you include the following information:\n- Exactly what Flow command you are using, and the directory in which you are running it (pwd)\n- The exact output of that Flow command\n- The contents of your ~/.atom/config.cson\nCould you also open the dev tools with cmd+alt+i, make sure you are on the console tab, and see whether any seemingly relevant errors are there? If you're not sure feel free to just paste an excerpt.\nLastly, have Flow errors ever worked for you in Nuclide?\n. I think a message that pops up would be too disruptive but there is a spinner in the status bar that indicates when we are waiting on diagnostic results from Flow. Sometimes with long startup times the diagnostics request times out so I think we could change some things to make sure the indicator is always spinning if Flow is busy. However I don't like the idea of adding a disruptive notification. I'm open to ideas on how to make this clearer without annoying people, though.\n. It's probably worth noting this somewhere, but not everybody has that line at the top of their .bashrc. Some generic troubleshooting steps, at the very least, would be helpful.\n. You have an unbelievably ancient version of Atom. Please upgrade. Specifically I suspect this error stems from the use of Array.from which did not exist in Atom's version of Node until 1.3 or so.\n. Unfortunately this will break our internal copy: the files do exist, and Flow will complain of an unused suppression. Since we run Flow pre-commit we can't take this as-is.\nOne thing I've thought about is pulling all of the module names out into a separate string on the line above, and then calling require with that string, e.g.:\nconst gatekeeperModule = '../fb-gatekeeper';\n// $FlowIgnore\ngatekeeper = require(gatekeeperModule).gatekeeper;\nThis way Flow will complain that \"The parameter passed to require() must be a literal string\" either way, so we can safely FlowIgnore it whether or not the module exists. This is kind of gross but I don't think it's any worse than what we have.\nCC @zertosh, @peterhal -- does this seem reasonable?\n. @zertosh points out that this will make us lose the type info for our internal modules so my idea is a non-starter.\n. So here's an even worse idea, but I'm not sure I can get it past code review: put a blatant type error on the same line as the require so there is always something to ignore.\n// $FlowIgnore\ngatekeeper = require('../fb-gatekeeper').gatekeeper; ('': number)\nHowever it's been a goal to eliminate these requires inside try/catches altogether so maybe we should just wait until we get to that...\n. I don't think we have the infrastructure to have a different .flowconfig synced to this repo, nor, I think, do we want to. Keeping it up-to-date and properly merged would be irritating. Anyway, I believe that right now all we can do is exclude files from getting synced, but other than that everything here is exactly the same as our internal copy.\n. This seems pretty reasonable to me.\n@facebook-github-bot import\n. The source of truth is actually now in the flow-typed repo: https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/blob/master/definitions/npm/rxjs_v5.0.x/flow_%3E%3Dv0.25.0/rxjs_v5.0.x.js\nWe contributed them there to help beta-test the flow-typed effort. However, I would be happy to work with you to get them included in your repo, if the Flow team likes that idea.\n@samwgoldman, @jeffmo: what do you think? Is it better to bundle them with rxjs or would you rather use flow-typed as the source of truth?\n. What sorts of files are you working on?\nThere is an issue with Flow that can manifest this way when Nuclide asks for type coverage results in certain cases. More details on my pull request to fix it here: https://github.com/facebook/flow/pull/1903. We also need this PR in to fix this in Nuclide: https://github.com/facebook/flow/pull/1904.\nOnce those are released we can start using the coverage command rather than dump-types and avoid this problem (assuming, of course, that this is the same problem).\nIn the mean time, you can disable the \"nuclide-type-coverage\" feature in the Nuclide settings which should mitigate the problem (again, assuming it's the same one I've seen).\n. Thanks for the info. No, Flow compiled from master will still have this problem. It will only be solved when Nuclide can stop calling dump-types for coverage info which will have to wait until the release of Flow v0.28, it looks like. And then, Nuclide doesn't currently have the machinery to call different commands based on the Flow version, so I'll either have to build that or wait to switch over by default until we want to stop supporting earlier versions of Flow.\nThis only happens in pathological cases where the string versions of inferred Flow types are enormous. It's not surprising that changing around your types made this problem disappear.\n. I've never heard of this happening nor have I seen it myself. I'd be willing to bet that it's another package you have installed. Try disabling your non-nuclide packages, then restarting to make sure they are completely cleared, and if this still happens, please reopen.\n. I don't think this is a Nuclide issue. You are using linter-eslint, which is not part of Nuclide, to run eslint. Nuclide displays the results from that, but nothing in that code has changed recently. I suspect a change either in your configuration or in linter-eslint.\nOne thing to check is what grammar is being used for your jsx files -- look in the bottom right of the status bar. Try changing it around to see if that helps. Try using the \"JavaScript\" language.\n. Thanks for the feedback. I do think this message is valuable because otherwise people may expect Flow features to work and not understand why nothing is happening. However I agree that the red box is a bit jarring in this context. What if it were yellow (the ordinary warning color) instead? Would that feel better to you?\nI understand that in the context of this specific tutorial the message is a bit strange, but we have to consider more cases than \"people following the react native tutorial\" with Nuclide.\n. I think you're right -- a blue message would be less alarming. I can also reword it a little bit. It should get the point across without worrying people.\n. I just put up a change for review that makes it look like this:\n\n. @ssorallen -- ping. Does this look good now?\n. Has been fixed. Seems pretty reasonable to me. @peterhal, @mostafaeweda, can you take a look?\n. I'm not sure how far down this path I want to go, but matching against a few more strings is relatively low-effort. I'll implement this.\n. Well, it's actually more complicated than just \"adding something to a list\" because describe.only is actually a different AST node than just describe, due to the dot: http://astexplorer.net/#/KFqGXzZ4TW\nSo, I'm worried that making it configurable would actually just cause more confusion because of issues like this.\nHonestly when I wrote this I just wanted something quick that would help me out with the tests I write... I was worried about the inevitable feature-creep involved in adding something like this that's not actually spec'd as part of the language. And here we are \ud83d\ude1b.\n. I'm glad you like it! I'm slowly chipping away at these feature requests when I have a few minutes here and there. I did this one first (change is currently in review) just because it's pretty quick. But I'd like to point out that it's not very hard to add things like #437 and I'll happily review pull requests (e.g. #441). If you have a new request it's worth opening an issue first to make sure we agree it would be good to have. But for an existing issue feel free to put something together if you want it urgently.\n. You've enabled display of uncovered regions by clicking the percentage in the status bar. Click it again to toggle this off.\nThese are different than ordinary typechecker errors -- they are simply informing you of areas where the typechecker doesn't know what types things have. I usually develop with this feature disabled, and then toggle it on when I want more information about which areas are covered by the type system.\n. cc @shushz -- possibly related to your recent paths change?\n. Please include steps to reproduce. In particular, if you are trying to use diff view on anything besides a Mercurial repository, this is expected behavior as noted in the error message.\n. Flow handles all of our autocomplete for JS code, so this isn't an issue with Nuclide itself. I can tell from your gif that Flow autocomplete in general is working fine, so I think there is something going on with this specific case. If you're sure that it used to work, then something has regressed and it should be fixed.\nFeel free to reopen on https://github.com/facebook/flow\n. It's ctrl-, and ctrl-., not ctrl-< and ctrl->\n. Oh, interesting, it looks like it's supposed to be ctrl-< and ctrl-> on Linux:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-navigation-stack/keymaps/navigation-stack.json\nI don't know why this isn't working. CC @peterhal\n. We switched to the npm which package at one point, but had to roll it back because something broke (I don't remember what). It would be good to fix this across the board (IIRC there are several places where we use which), but I would also accept a PR to add a platform check to that function.\n. This has been fixed\n. I doubt we're going to do that. We would either have to copy all of the files down to a temp directory (which won't work because we want to support very large repositories), or create a virtual filesystem that fetches files on demand (which would be cool, but would be a huge chunk of work that would be difficult to justify).\nI think the solutions outlined in #516 will be the way forward. That way, third-party terminal packages that want to support Nuclide will have the means to do so. However it's unlikely that we will make the remote connection so transparent that all third-party packages work off-the-shelf.\n. If you've uninstalled Nuclide and you're still having problems, I don't think it's a problem with Nuclide. Also, if we are going to help you, we need exact error text. Saying that \"a bunch of stuff doesn't work\" and paraphrasing error messages is not enough information.\n. Nuclide could copy it to a temp directory and checksum it once. But yes, it's necessary to have flow-bin download everything up front for this to be possible. Otherwise we have to run flow-bin code in order to even download the binary, which means we have to checksum the entire contents of the node_modules/flow-bin directory. Which I guess is doable, though not palatable.\n@satya164 regarding bundling Flow with Nuclide, we could either ship binaries for all platforms of all supported Flow versions (probably not doable), or download them on the fly. Since this code lives inside of Nuclide and not in the project being opened, there are not security concerns if Nuclide itself downloads it. However that does have the problems that @zertosh pointed out, such as not using npm's proxies.\nAnyway I will start by implementing a setting that allows Nuclide to look for flow-bin and use the Flow from it. Unfortunately it cannot be the default, but it sounds like it will still add value. Right now I'm in the middle of upgrading Nuclide's own code to use Flow v0.28, but I will implement this setting after that.\n. Note that Atom gets providers on startup even if nothing is consuming them. So the fact that provide is called doesn't actually indicate that anything is consuming it.\nI don't think we ever implemented the * as a wildcard in grammarScopes. Take a look at the type here. There's an alternative that we came up with. Just set allGrammarScopes to true. If you still have trouble after that, let us know.\n. Definitely agreed on the resizing, but realistically I'm not going to get around to it anytime soon. Tooltips with full error output should be pretty doable, though.\nI disagree that we should put an error on line 28 in your example. Flow is clearly reporting the primary location to be line 320. Often, Flow errors have many, many locations and it wouldn't be reasonable to display the error at all of them. Instead, we should work with the Flow team to make sure that errors are placed in the best location to begin with.\n. diagnostics feature requests have since been implemented, and error positioning problems are problems with Flow, not Nuclide. @tyangliu @alanzanattadev Don't worry about squashing, our tooling should squash automatically.\n. @facebook-github-bot shipit\n. @facebook-github-bot import\n. Oh, you need to sign the CLA\n. I'll look into it\n. The working sets feature gets you part of the way there. Extending it from manually-defined working sets to \"smart\" working sets would be awesome.\n. Oh, I don't know why the default for that setting is false. It should be true. There isn't a performance concern. Plugins that don't perform well can opt out of linting on the fly. Anyway, in your case, checking the box should fix it until we push out the change in defaults. I just tried it out with linter-eslint and it worked fine.\nWe have our own interface for linter-like things, called diagnostics. The term \"legacy\" was just used to differentiate between the two (I think it was a poor choice of word and I will change it).\nOur diagnostics interface doesn't poll providers, like the linter interface does. Instead, providers can push messages at any time. This means that it is up to each provider to choose whether to \"lint on the fly\" or not -- it can't be controlled by one central setting.\nWe used to have an option in the nuclide-flow package to allow this. I removed it because people kept getting confused and reporting bugs with it. Here's why:\nThere are two Flow commands for getting errors. flow status looks at the state on disk and returns all of the errors for the project. We want to be able to display all errors, not just the ones in your current file, so we need to call this at some point. flow check-contents takes the unsaved contents of a single file and returns its errors. Obviously, we also need to call this if we want checking without saving.\nHere are the problems that I remember:\n- check-contents will return errors even for files that don't have /* @flow */ at the top. Since we are also calling status that means there will sometimes be errors and there sometimes won't be.\n- check-contents displays errors only for the current file, as if you had the changes in the current file plus everything else on disk. That means errors will be inconsistent with other unsaved files. Granted, I'm not sure how big of an issue this is but some people I've discussed with were concerned by it.\nI will talk to the Flow team and see if we can add an option to check-contents to respect the presence or absence of the @flow pragma, and then I would be okay with bringing back this feature behind a setting.\n. No, not today. I'm getting the ball rolling on that, though. I don't want to release it until we can respect the lack of a @flow pragma, otherwise it can get really confusing. We got a lot of complaints about this when we allowed it.\n. We use eslint: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/resources/eslint-plugin-nuclide-internal/license-header.js\nIf you have more questions about that, open an issue on the Flow repo so we don't further pollute this discussion.\n. I've added the necessary flag to Flow, and it will be available with the next release. Here's what I'm thinking for the desired behavior in Nuclide:\n- Whenever you save any file, we call flow status (which returns all project-wide errors) and use the given results for every saved file. We will leave unsaved files alone.\n- As you type, we call flow check-contents. We update that file only.\nWe still have the problem where changes in a given unsaved file are not reflected elsewhere, but I'm not sure how much of an issue that will be in practice.\n. Just put up https://github.com/facebook/flow/pull/2118 to address another issue with Flow that I found while working on this.\n. This looks like an issue with Atom's install/update process, possibly caused by your beta OS but I don't know enough to really speculate on that.\nNuclide never removes its code itself. The update/install/uninstall process is handled by Atom and we have no control over it.\n. Yeah, I also can't reproduce this. Please include a complete example.\n. Please fill out steps to reproduce\n. Dup of #610 \n. Feel free to reopen if you sign the CLA\n. Please include the requested information. Specifically, the versions and the installed packages.\n. My suspicion is that a pre-UP version of nuclide-blame-provider-hg is installed and it's conflicting with the post-UP version. I'd be surprised if a code caching problem could cause that, since it's been quite a long time since we moved all config into package.json files. Unfortunately I can't confirm that without the requested information.\n. You can always remove packages manually by deleting them from ~/.atom/packages if it comes to that.\n. Feel free to put up a PR, should be trivial given the machinery I've created to support it.only, etc.\n. We simply surface the data provided by Flow. I have noticed this same issue myself but I don't know the reason behind it. If you would like to pursue it, please re-open on https://github.com/facebook/flow\n. Thanks!\n. @facebook-github-bot shipit\n. I want to be very careful about making Flow slower. It's an important part of JS development for people who use it, and while it's rechecking it can't provide any IDE features. Here are a few other ideas that I would like to investigate before just chopping more cores off blindly:\n- Create a config option with a sane default so that people can specify their own preferred number of cores.\n- You say this is a problem with big machines in particular. So maybe make the heuristic take that into account and use a smaller percentage of cores on a bigger machine.\n- Run Flow with ionice and/or nice when available.\n- You cite rebases as a specific pain point. Maybe Flow could wait to recheck until after a rebase is complete (we watch for rebases in Nuclide and delay work until they are over, so there is precedent). Obviously this one would require changes to Flow.\n. Maybe on 32 core machines, but if you have 4 or 8 cores you aren't going to be drowning in IO nearly as much. Which is why one of the suggestions I made is just a more complex heuristic. In your example I think using 16/32 cores would be reasonable, but I don't want to use 4/8 on my laptop.\nAnd ionice ought to solve the IO problem altogether without slowing down the CPU-bound parts.\n. > Does Flow make use of more than one worker when just one file changed?\nYes. The number of files changed is not a good predictor of the number of workers Flow needs. It has to recheck every file that is dependent on the changed file(s). I've seen that number approach 1000 in large codebases. There are several phases but the local inference/typechecking phase is trivially parallelizable I believe. If you are checking 1000 files it's going to be slow but you definitely want to throw as much computation at it as you can spare in that case.\nI recommend getting in touch with the Flow team if you need a more detailed answer. But generally-speaking we want all the workers we can get.\n. @billschaller A while back I made the change to run Flow with nice/ionice. You said you would follow up and I haven't heard anything about it from you, so I assume that alleviated your pain? With that in mind I'm going to close this.\n. Look pretty reasonable to me, aside from a few nits.\n. @facebook-github-bot import\n. @pvolok Thank you! I'm also looking forward to using this when working in Flow.\n. @pvolok I've been starting to do more work on Flow, and finally got my ocamlmerlin updated. I'm really enjoying the outline view. Thanks again for contributing this.. Weird, it does look like that. Can you provide repro steps and all the standard version info? Is this on Atom master? I've never seen this.\n. Oh sorry, I just realized that this did not happen to you personally. Still, do you have any version info sent back along with this? Thanks for reporting.\n. Nuclide doesn't have compatibility with ESLint built in. For that, we recommend the linter-eslint Atom package which will run ESLint and give us the messages to display.\nDoes Flow work from the command line? Can you paste the nuclide-flow section of your ~/.atom/config.cson file, the version of Flow, and all the info requested in the issue template that appears when you click \"new issue?\"\nAlso note that we currently only support Atom 1.8, though I'm not aware of an issue like this with Atom 1.9.\n. Thanks for the thorough bug report. Flow errors are working fine for me so I'm not sure what's going on. We do have a known issue where the diagnostics gutter sometimes doesn't appear at all for a particular tab. I see it from time to time but I don't know what causes it. But that doesn't explain why some errors show up and others do not, in the same file.\nIf you have any more details you can add I would appreciate it. In the mean time I will try out linter-eslint and see if that makes anything weird happen. Though I do use it occasionally and have never run into this.\n. Oh awesome, glad you figured it out. I'll look into it to see if there's something we can do to improve the UX in that case. Should be simple enough to pop up a warning. In general I don't think that's a configuration that we want to support, though. I believe strip_root was added to Flow only to facilitate testing and it is not recommended for widespread use.\n. As of facebook/flow@79b4997, the strip_root option can no longer be specified in .flowconfig. Once that's released this problem should be permanently solved.. I just double-checked to make sure that Nuclide properly kills Flow and for me it still does. I'm not sure what's going on here. I'm on Atom 1.9.6 and OS X 10.11.6 so I suppose one of those version differences could affect it.\nNuclide only kills Flow if it starts the Flow server itself. If there is already a Flow server, Nuclide will not kill it. Were you using Flow on the command line as well?\nCould you paste the output of ps -eaf | grep flow after closing Atom?\n. Thanks for the additional details. I wasn't using flow-bin so I will try reproducing the issue with a global installation of flow-bin. It seems plausible that the way it invokes Flow could mean that the way we kill it won't work.\n. Specifically are you unhappy about the memory usage? If so you'll need to report that on the Flow repo, that is not Nuclide's domain.\n. This is an issue with Flow, which provides this functionality. More discussion in #353\n. Feel free to open or add to an issue on the Flow repo. I'm also pushing on them to get this fixed since I'm also frustrated by this problem.\n. Known incompatibility with Nuclide and Atom 1.9.x. It was just fixed in 2b081d0f17b26a19b37df4ce01030ecf0b960a1a which will be out with the next Nuclide release.\n. CC @peterhal who has most recently worked on this.\nHonestly our ocamlmerlin integration isn't exactly our flagship feature and while I wish I had more time to work on it, I really don't. It basically gets maintained in people's spare time. Pull requests are very welcome.\n. I have the same problem. Specifically my experience has been that while my cursor is moving over the type hint, it stays up. But as soon as my cursor stops (like right when I'm about to click the pin button), it disappears.\n. @jgebhardt the fix for this will be released with v0.166.0 right?\n. I pushed v0.166.0 minutes ago. Closing out.\n. I'm not an expert on npm but v0.165.0 is published to npm so this doesn't sound like an issue on our end. It may be worth uninstalling and re-installing the nuclide package. When you install you can also specify a version via something like npm install -g nuclide@0.165.0. Hopefully that works.\n. We simply display the info that Flow reports. Feel free to reopen on the Flow repository.\n. We just get autocomplete results from ocamlmerlin. Nuclide itself knows very little about OCaml. I think your best bet would be to file a bug against ocamlmerlin.\nClosing as I don't believe this is something we can change in Nuclide.\n. Interesting. @shushz any thoughts on this?\n. We're working on this, but currently Flow does not support find references or rename operations. The Flow team needs to build that, and we need to build the UI.\n. Don't think there is one, and the work isn't planned. We'd like to do it at some point but we don't yet know when.. Nope, check out my answer here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/689#issuecomment-281215820\nThe current Flow find-refs is a good first step but it's woefully inadequate for any real refactoring functionality. And even the limited functionality that it promises is currently really buggy.. I've been working on global find-refs in Flow. It's currently in beta and works fairly well, though there are still a number of known issues. You can try it out in Nuclide by checking the \"Enable global find references\" setting under the Flow category. Make sure you are using at least Flow v0.66.0 because there are some pretty serious issues with find-refs before that version.\nOver the next couple months I plan to implement global rename atop find-references. This will be exposed through the refactorizer command in Nuclide that @FDiskas screenshotted above.\n@scottwio I'm sure that you can imagine how this is handled currently. Obviously it's less than ideal so I am looking forward to shipping rename.. Yeah, I've been continuing to make find-refs more reliable, which will directly impact the quality of rename, and I plan in the next 4-6 weeks to get a prototype for rename landed. I'll probably gate it behind a setting in Nuclide at first while I work out the kinks but if you're interested you'll be able to access it. I would use care at first to make sure it's doing the right thing.. As I said in #688 Flow does not support this operation. Nuclide has the UI for find references and it's used for Hack, but Flow does not provide this functionality. Once they do it will be easy to plumb it up to our UI.\n. Closing as this is a Flow issue, not Nuclide.. Nope, this only finds refs within a single file, not globally. @zertosh actually added a Nuclide setting to surface this functionality (Highlight identifier references under Flow). But it's currently pretty buggy and has surprising results which is why it's currently gated.. FYI I just updated https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/2398. Support for this is imminent.. Do you have Flow installed and accessible? If you have a Flow version specified in your .flowconfig file, is it the same version as what you have installed? Are other Flow features working?\n. Okay, you need Flow for this. You should have received a popup explaining that Flow is not installed and how to install it.\n. Yeah, that would be great. It should look like the blue box in #537, and should only appear once each Atom run (assuming you haven't disabled it). So, restart Atom and try to use outline view. If you don't get the message, and you haven't disabled it, that's weird.\n. Yep, that's the relevant setting. I don't know why you're not getting the warning. Could it be that you actually had Flow installed, but it was the wrong version? We still don't warn if that happens, though I've been meaning to do it for a while.\n. Weird. I really don't know what could cause that, then. All my simple theories have been disproven so it's probably some unusual configuration I hadn't thought of or a weird bug. I don't know what other questions I can ask you so all I'll say is if you come across anything interesting that seems related to this, please let me know.\n. Closing since it appears in at least one case that Flow simply was not installed. The issue where a warning does not appear when that happens is separate.\n. You have some ancient packages installed from when Nuclide was a collection of separate packages. Nuclide consists of only one package now: nuclide. Please remove all other nuclide-* packages.\n. There are limitations with Atom that make this painful. At one point we had a hack that made this work but an Atom update broke it. Honestly we are unlikely to get to fixing this.\nInstead I recommend that you open the full error message by hovering over the red or orange triangle in the gutter at the line where the error is. Then there will be a copy button which will copy the full error text.\n. This looks like an issue with either Atom or a theme, and not Nuclide. For example, we do not control the \"About Atom\" page which is also missing icons.\n. Like @bolinfest says we did this, and really wanted to fully embrace the modular philosophy of the Atom ecosystem but it was unsustainable. Our focus has to be on making sure that Nuclide works well as a whole, and when it was 100 different packages it simply didn't. In fact, because each Nuclide package shared so many dependencies that weren't deduped, the single nuclide package we have now is not much bigger on disk than each package we had in the past.\nIt sounds like you're specifically after extensibility, right? Most of the things you mention actually are extensible via Atom's service-hub. We'd like to make our APIs more stable and well-documented but nobody's found the time yet.\nSo today you actually can write a separate Atom package that interfaces with Nuclide. The main hurdle is finding and understanding the APIs. Hyperclick, diagnostics, type coverage, outline view, code formatting, to name a few, will all happily consume data from other packages.\nThere are a few main issues we are currently facing, but none of them are intractable:\n- We don't have good documentation of our APIs.\n- Many of our APIs should not be considered stable. We should make it clear which ones are and commit to not making breaking changes without a grace period.\n- Some features don't actually use service-hub. For example, I'm pretty sure that getting diff view working with Git would require nontrivial changes to the Nuclide codebase itself. In this particular instance I'm not sure that's a bad thing but there may be some features worth revisiting.\nSo, if you'd like to pitch in I think the main thing that would help right now is documentation. You can take a look at all the packages in pkg, find out which ones expose functionality via service-hub by looking in package.json files, and then submit documentation PRs to the docs folder. It's probably worth opening an issue first so we can discuss whether we want to consider a particular API stable.\nI'm closing since we aren't going to split Nuclide up into a ton of small packages (with the possible exception of a few parts like hyperclick). But we do share your goals regarding extensibility.\n. @bernatfortet Right now it's unfortunately a bit hidden (this isn't a deliberate choice, just nobody's gotten around to making it better yet). You have to go to the settings for the \"nuclide\" package and then scroll all the way down. You'll see a list of checkboxes about various features there.\n. Like I said in my last comment, you actually can disable individual pieces of Nuclide and leave only the ones you want running. You can certainly disable everything but the debugger pieces if that's what you want.. Not a Nuclide issue. See #356 for an explanation.\n. I also wonder whether autocomplete-modules might interfere.\n. Okay, can you give a specific case where it doesn't work and you expect it to? Can you describe the exact behavior that you observe? Are there some cases where autocomplete reliably works?\n. We get all our JS autocomplete directly from Flow, which does not provide autocomplete for React here. I bet it's related to https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/2120. This isn't a Nuclide issue but feel free to reopen on the Flow repository.\n. @matthewwithanm I can reproduce this. Related to the migration to workspace views? It definitely used to work.\n. Also note that our Windows support in general is iffy, though improving. So there might be some issues at play here that we aren't aware of.\n. This is very interesting, thanks for digging in. We just use where/which to check that Flow is installed. We don't actually use the full path to the binary that we receive from it. I assumed that if it's on the PATH, just executing flow would allow the system to find the binary. This assumption works for OS X/Linux but evidently not for Windows?\nThe second issue is unfortunate but I think I understand what's going on. We use the same codepath whether you specify a full path or just leave it as \"flow\" which is the default. One Linux/OS X you can call which with a full path to a binary or just a command name, and it works fine either way. Evidently where doesn't like that.\n. No, frankly we aren't very focused on local Windows development. I'd be happy to discuss solutions and review PRs but I'm not going to spend time solving this myself in the foreseeable future.\n. It seems people have been using Flow on Windows through Nuclide with mixed success. We've had a handful of issues filed and a handful of PRs contributed for minor fixes.\n. We definitely need more information than this\n. What version of Flow do you have? With v0.32 I actually observe an error and no outline.\nAnyway this would be a pretty easy PR if you'd like to contribute. Otherwise I'll probably get to it in the next week or two.\n. I'm fixing this today\n. There's currently no setting for it, but I think it would be reasonable to add one. Due to the way autocomplete-plus works, it would have to require a restart of Atom in order to apply. I would happily review a PR to add this.\n. It looks like your install or the require cache got corrupted. Could you try restarting Atom, and if that doesn't work, try removing and re-installing the nuclide package? Let us know whether that works.\n. That seems worth a try. Honestly this is a pretty weird error and I'm not really sure what to make of it.\n. This looks like either a mismatch between what's on disk and what's in memory or an issue with the require cache. Either way, restarting Atom should fix it. Let us know whether that works.\n. These commands actually exist but they only show up when the file tree has focus. Coupled with the pending pane items feature (where clicking once on a file opens a temporary editor), the file tree doesn't have focus very much.\nYou could put up a PR to make these commands available no matter what has focus. It would just entail moving them up to where the commands are registered for atom-workspace: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-file-tree/lib/FileTreeController.js#L142 \n. This is weird. We all use this every day and haven't noticed this. Could you capture a CPU profile so we can take a look?\nAlso CC @shushz\n. I saw this issue on the Atom 1.12 beta but I'm using Atom 1.11.2 without any issues. @zertosh do you have any ideas what might be going on here?\n. Still thought it's an open question why this would be happening on Atom 1.11.2...\n. Please fill in the requested version information and add some details about your project (e.g. which language, etc.)\n. Do you have Flow installed?\n. This is likely just because Flow was not installed.. I'm just as stumped. What if you open Atom and then use atom -a folderToOpen from the command line? You may have to run 'Install Shell Commands' from the Atom menu first, if you haven't done so already.\nRegarding tool-bar -- automatic installation of recommended packages is off by default, so this setup is normal (https://nuclide.io/docs/editor/setup/#post-installation__recommended-packages). For context, we turn this on by default for Facebook employees so that's where the confusion came from.\n. I understand the motivation here but I disagree that this is desirable behavior. Showing multiple error messages (a) duplicates information, (b) makes it so that it seems like there are more errors than there actually are, and (c) makes the number of errors inconsistent with the command line output, which is liable to confuse people.\nUsually people want this because Flow reports the error in a confusing location. Instead of showing it at all locations, it would be better if Flow just reported it at the best location. In your example (based on a similar example I just put together), Flow reports the main location as that where the props property is defined. I agree that this is a confusing location. However, a better solution would be to have Flow report a different main error location. The Flow team has agreed to treat cases like this as bugs. I recommend opening an issue on Flow or searching for a similar one.\nAnyway, thanks for putting up the PR. I appreciate the time spent even though I ultimately disagree that this is a step forward.\n. I'm not very familiar with that part of the code, but is the clock on your client machine significantly off from the clock on your local machine? I think that could cause this.\n. Please include steps to reproduce.\n@mostafaeweda, @aadisriram: Do you know what's going on here?\n. Had you just updated nuclide or any other packages? Is there any other information you could add about what you were doing before you saw this error? Did you have other project folders open already, or was this the first one? Had you just opened Nuclide or had you already been working for a while?\n. You have an outdated version of Nuclide. Please try updating Nuclide and re-open if the issue persists.\n. We don't currently support the standalone hyperclick package. It is now bundled with Nuclide, so since you do have Nuclide installed the easiest thing to do is to just remove the standalone hyperclick package.\n. While some loss of performance over stock Atom is unfortunately expected, it certainly shouldn't be crippling.\nIf you grab a CPU profile and post it somewhere where we can get it, we can see if there are any obvious problems.\nIt may also help if you shared details about your workflow (at the very least, what language(s) you are working in and if there are any specific Nuclide features you have open).\n. @hansonw since you are neck deep in this code right now could you review?\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. The 'Go to Declaration' item in the context menu is provided by the symbols-view package which ships with Atom, and we have no control over it. It is based on ctags and is not very reliable. It's also not extensible so we can't override its functionality without resorting to some ugly hacks.\nOur replacement is hyperclick, which uses ctrl+click on Linux.\nI haven't pulled down your code to confirm, but my suspicion is that Flow simply isn't able to track the value property through the StyleSheet.create() call. Try temporarily replacing that with just a plain old object and let us know if hyperclick starts working.\nAnother thing you can do is look at the type coverage (click the percentage in status bar). If it says that styles.value is uncovered then it confirms my theory.\nLet us know what you find.\n. Great, thanks for following up. May be worth opening an issue on the React Native repo. I don't know what the state of integration between RN and Flow is.\n. Unfortunately our OSS contribution workflow isn't very streamlined. A lot of us would like to improve it but we just haven't found the time to invest. The issue that you're probably referring to is that we have several instances of require('fb-something') where that module is only available internally. We do this for things like analytics: we want to collect data on how FB employees are using Nuclide, but we don't want to collect data on open source users. There are also a few places where we set defaults differently for employees vs other people.\nAnyway, if that's all that Flow is warning about, don't worry. You can uncomment the FlowFB line in the .flowconfig and if we've been diligent, that should ignore all of those type errors.\nWe do intend to move these to flow-typed. The main issue is that we need to add the concept of namespaces to flow-typed. Right now it is only suitable for npm pacakge libdefs. We started some discussion on a related issue. We are hoping to get to adding namespaces in the coming weeks but if you are interested in helping out we could use the extra hands. Feel free to weigh in on that issue.\nAnyway I'm going to look at your actual PR now.\n. - I'm sure it's a mix of both \"private\" and \"just undocumented.\" Either way, only the public docs give us a good way of guessing which parts of the API are more-or-less guaranteed to be stable.\n- Leaving potentially unstable APIs out of our typedefs means that we can't use them (without doing convoluted tricks to escape Flow, which are obvious in code review). So it does accomplish the intended purpose.\nAnyway, we aren't wholly against adding undocumented APIs here, we just would like to do it sparingly. If you get them added to Atom's docs then we will definitely add them here.\n. urlregexp already matches a ton of things that aren't likely to be URLs so I'm not too worried about that. As long as my inline comments are addressed I'm \ud83d\udc4d.\n. This looks like a corrupted install. Try removing and then re-installing the Nuclide package.. You need to install hack: https://nuclide.io/docs/languages/hack/. In steelbrain/linter, what happens when a provider returns null, or a promise that resolves to null? Is it the same as it returning an empty set of lints?\nAs implemented, this PR means that if a provider returns some results, then on a subsequent call returns null, the previous results will remain visible. Is that intentional, or do you want to invalidate the current messages so that nothing is displayed?. Perfect, then \ud83d\udc4d . That's our fault, and frankly it's something I'm really unhappy about. We have various places where for the sake of expedience we've added some facebook-internal functionality into these fb- prefixed files, which ship with our internal version but do not get synced to GitHub. This means that when running Flow on the GitHub copy, you will see these errors.\nI don't have a great solution for you, to be honest. Probably just run Flow yourself and ignore these errors. And for running tests, just run the tests for the package you are working on.\nFixing this properly will take a concerted effort on our part. A lot of us want to do it but we just haven't had the time. In the meantime if you have ideas for how to ease the pain I would be more than happy to review pull requests (maybe adding options to the script or something). Feel free to open issues to discuss ideas and CC me so I get to them promptly.. But, I don't think we've been diligent about adding those comments so it might not get all of them. And be careful not to include the config change in your PR :/. Thanks, LGTM. Still, the video you posted doesn't look right. Let us know if you uncover anything else that might be useful. I can't really tell what might be going on from the info here. Using pstree might be enlightening.. I let Nuclide sit on the health panel for a while and didn't see the number of child processes growing. Something is definitely strange here.. last-cursor-position isn't our package, nor do we support it. We do have something similar.  Check out the 'nuclide-navigation-stack' commands.. haha oops. @joelmarcey could you follow up?. Yeah if that's the case that's an error. On OS X at least, ctrl-< goes backwards. PRs are welcome.. Yeah, the docs here are wrong for OS X. The docs are correct for Linux, but of course the keybindings themselves are backwards. Should be an easy fix if you'd like to contribute it.. I'm pretty sure this is supported but @hansonw is the expert here so I will leave a full answer to him. Unfortunately our Windows support isn't very good. We have people using Nuclide on Windows as a client for remote development on a Linux machine, but local Windows development isn't in a very good state. I'll happily review a PR if you figure out how to solve this issue, but we aren't going to work on it ourselves in the near future.. Yeah, I think the best place to start would be to look at the canFindFlow function. I expect that's returning false, which means something is going wrong in the which utility which we've halfheartedly attempted to make compatible with Windows.\nThat should give you a good place to start. I'm happy to answer questions when I can. I should be able to get back to you pretty quickly here during normal working hours on the west coast.. It is expected that right now you have to save to get typechecker results. There are some improvements in the pipeline but we haven't fully rolled them out yet. cc @peterhal for an update on this.\nI would expect you to get autocomplete. Could you include a code snippet and indicate where your cursor is in the code?. I think the autocomplete you're seeing is built in to Atom, and not actually part of Nuclide. It does some simple autocompletion based only on tokens it has seen in your code. Unfortunately I don't know why you aren't seeing more autocompletion. I would definitely at the very least expect it after ->. I'll defer to @peterhal who is the expert in this area.. This has been mostly implemented but there are a few minor issues that need to be resolved before we roll it out fully. Nobody has spent time on them recently, unfortunately.\nWe use something called GateKeeper to control feature rollout for internal users. Right now, anything that is behind a GateKeeper will default to off for people outside of Facebook. If you would like to contribute something that would make that configurable somehow I'm happy to discuss and bring it up with the rest of the team.\nOtherwise, you'll have to wait until we are satisfied with the experience and remove the GateKeeper.. I think it's not trivial, but it could be done incrementally. At the very least, something that lets non-fb users enable features hidden behind gatekeepers (or even just this specific one) would be nice. Anyway you are certainly under no obligation to contribute, I just like to suggest it when it's not clear how long it will take the core team to get to something.. https://nuclide.io/docs/help/faq/#how-can-i-jump-to-the-last-cursor-position-in-a-file. Unfortunately we don't currently support the standalone hyperclick package. We may split certain parts of Nuclide back out at some point in the future, but right now it's just not worth the extra overhead for us.. Dup of #911 . Cool, generally I'm supportive of using a first-class service-hub interface that is well-specified rather than a bunch of random DOM hackery. However I don't have any context on this particular problem. Maybe @shushz can weigh in on whether we should move forward with this?\nEither way I wouldn't count on anyone on the core team taking time to work on this soon. If we decide that we'd like to move forward we will likely need community contributions to actually implement this.. Keep in mind that I'm not endorsing this particular change. I don't know enough about the specifics here. I do believe that the Atom folks are generally very reasonable though, so if they had concerns about this API we may very well have the same concerns. We need somebody familiar with the file tree to weigh in here before we move forward.. Looks good, thanks!. You need Flow installed for all of our JavaScript features. Do you have it installed?. Yes, this should work. Unfortunately I don't know when we'll have the time to dig into it, but if you have the time we would very much appreciate it. If you find out what's going wrong I'm happy to discuss possible fixes, and feel free to CC me on relevant PRs for a quick review.. Based on what people have told me, there are a couple problems here.\n\nwhere returns every matching binary. In contrast, which only returns the first one. This might be breaking us (not sure).\nIf a path to Flow is set, we call which/where with that path to see if it exists. This means that we could set the default value for that config to flow and then just use whatever Atom returns for that config (a full path or just flow, or the user could even use an alternate command for Flow rather than a full path). Unfortunately, I believe where fails when passed a full path.\n\nNeither of these should be terribly difficult to work through, but they need somebody with a Windows machine to get around to fixing and testing these cases. As I've mentioned in previous similar issues, support for local Windows development isn't a top priority for the team. If somebody wants to investigate and fix, though, we would welcome a PR. Feel free to CC me on it. I'm also happy to consult on proposed changes.. Check out the \"Show full diagnostic traces\" setting. IIRC it's not the default just because it takes up a lot more room, and the diagnostics panel is intended as an overview.. @mwalkerwells I don't believe it should be on by default but I would happily review a PR to add a toggle switch for it, next to the \"show only diagnostics for current file\" one. This seems likely. Our source control integration is fairly tightly-coupled with the Mercurial installs we have by default at Facebook. CC @mostafaeweda for more info.. @vjeux I thought you fixed this?. I will look into this. I've been refactoring a lot of Nuclide's Flow code so it's possible that caused this problem. I know it used to work.. Hey, I finally got around to checking this out but I actually cannot reproduce with my setup (I admit I didn't go as far as spinning up the vagrant VM you mentioned). The not found warning shows up as expected both for local and remote.. Thanks! At first glance this looks pretty high quality, although I do have some comments. I'll take a closer look tomorrow.. I think that if you just subscribe to the setting (featureConfig.observe) and use that as the source of truth, and when the box is checked you call featureConfig.set, then you should have no problems with inconsistency. I'm not 100% sure that the settings panel will immediately react to outside changes to config options, but even if it doesn't I think this is a good way to go.. Okay, I'm pulling it in for internal review so I can get another set of eyes on it.. @mwalkerwells It looks like @matthewwithanm is planning to just make the copy changes himself. This will land shortly.. I haven't seen this happen, but Atom 1.14 did change the way it handles symlinks. It used to canonicalize paths for text editors, and now it does not. However, Flow still canonicalizes paths. So, I wonder if you have symlinks in your project path. You may be opening /path/through/symlink/MyTest.js. Then Flow tells us that the symbol you are navigating to is defined in /canonical/path/MyTest.js so we open a new editor.\nBefore, Atom would have used the canonical path for the editor, so it would have known not to open a new one.\nThis is just speculation, I haven't actually reproduced this issue. Let me know if this sounds right.. Unfortunately I don't have a great solution here other than to stop using symlinks. After some discussion we realized that in order to have a consistent experience, every tool in the stack has to subscribe to the same symlink philosophy (either always canonicalize or never canonicalize). Given the number of tools we integrate with, that seems unlikely to happen.\nThere are a number of things we could do to hack around simple cases but they all have caveats and it seems like they would overall just increase confusion and add more opportunities for bugs. Ultimately for now we just decided to recommend avoiding symlinks.. Sorry, but I don't think anybody monitoring this repository is qualified to give you legal advice. It looks like you have an old version of Node installed on the server. You currently need at least Node 6.5.0: https://nuclide.io/docs/help/troubleshooting/#installation. This is pretty much a known issue with Flow. I'm closing because this isn't specific to Nuclide, but feel free to open an issue on the facebook/flow repository.. This looks like a corrupt install. Try removing and re-installing Nuclide.. You have enabled the experimental \"Highlight identifier references\" option in the settings for Flow, which warns in its description that \"it is still under-development, so the results may not be what you expect.\". Nuclide doesn't do any syntax highlighting for JS/Flow code. We recommend checking out the language-babel package which does a pretty good job.. There's a setting for this -- look in the Nuclide settings page under the \"Flow\" header. This is an issue with Flow, not Nuclide. Nuclide simply displays what Flow returns. Feel free to re-open on the Flow repo.\nWith that said, we are tracking various issues like this with Flow's IDE features, and I've made a note of this one. A specific repro case would be helpful so that I can catalogue it. I'm hoping we can get a bunch of this stuff done in the next few months.. Nuclide simply reports the errors at the locations Flow gives us. Feel free to report this here: https://github.com/facebook/flow\nYes, the error location may look better on the Flow CLI, but if we took the location that appears first on the CLI there are other errors that would end up in the wrong position. This needs to be fixed by Flow.. I'm willing to bet this is a dupe of #662\nThe strip_root config option is confusing and I think it should be removed altogether. It serves no useful purpose (running flow status already strips the root). The only thing it does is confuse editors.. As of https://github.com/facebook/flow/commit/79b4997cce208dbca9d2b07ff4629e3ce15ff2e2, the strip_root option can no longer be specified in .flowconfig. Once that's released this problem should be permanently solved.. I can't repro on my OS X laptop, using the \"Use the Flow binary included in each project's flow-bin\" setting with Nuclide on master as well as Flow v0.53.1 installed in the project by yarn. Flow starts up and runs just fine for me.\nI also don't see any changes related to how Nuclide finds or executes Flow between v0.244.0 (which several people here have reported as working) and v0.249.0 (https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/compare/release-v0.244.0...release-v0.249.0)\nThis leads me to believe that this issue is caused by something external to Nuclide and Flow. If folks have a different binary for which like @xdissent did, I could definitely see that causing problems. I'd see what the output of which which (lol) is -- if it's not /usr/bin/which (on OS X, anyway) then something weird is definitely going on.\nYou may also be able to shed some light on the situation by posting the logs after this happens. I believe they are located in $TMPDIR/nuclide-$USER-logs. Please put them in a gist or use a paste service, and include the link here. Don't paste them directly into a comment.. I suspect the Windows problems are unrelated. Windows support has been a bit dicey for a while, and #1041 changed things in v0.249.0. It seems possible that it breaks some cases (cc @ebluestein @jrajav). Check out #1281 -- it looks like there's a fix for that coming in #1280.. Check out flow-typed to get type definitions for jquery. I'm not sure about the Audio class, but if it is in fact built in then Flow should understand it out of the box. Feel free to send a PR with supporting documentation to https://github.com/facebook/flow.\nClosing as this is unrelated to Nuclide. For further discussion please open an issue on https://github.com/facebook/flow. I'd happily review a PR to fix this. Feel free to CC me if you put something up and I'll make sure to take a look at it quickly.. That's fair but it's a good candidate for a first PR if you change your mind.. What version of flow-bin do you have listed in your package.json? I thought I fixed this in v0.55.0 but this isn't the only report of people with more recent Flow versions having some trouble with this. I can't reproduce with this code snippet and Flow v0.57.3. Yes, I recently enabled it by default in Nuclide, since I fixed it in Flow. This week's Nuclide release will have a setting so that people using old versions of Flow (or who just don't like the feature) will be able to disable it.. I'm getting a parse error here, due to this extraneous semicolon. Did you actually try running this?\n. Please remove the trailing whitespace\n. Please add a semicolon here\n. semicolon\n. trailing whitespace\n. Since obj is already defined in this scope, please use a different variable name here to avoid shadowing.\n. semicolon\n. nit: there ought to be a space after the if\n. semicolon\n. semicolon\n. Each message is an array of objects. hasMessageWithPath expects an object with a path property. So, it always returns false and all linter messages are filtered out.\n. This won't work at all remotely. I'm fine with adding this, so long as you don't write code in the future that depends on certain flags having been passed.\n. For future contributions, you can use the linter-eslint Atom package to warn you of issues from within Atom. You can also run npm run lint-all --ignore-scripts false from the root of the nuclide repository to check for lint errors (this should probably be in CONTRIBUTING.md or something).\nOur CI prevents changes with lint errors from getting committed so things need to be lint-clean to get accepted.\n. This needs a return type, since this is part of the RPC boundary. If you run the tests they should fail because of this.\n. We prefer checking for null/undefined explicitly rather than relying on truthiness. For example if kind is '' this will have confusing results. It's slightly more verbose but\nif (kind != null) {\n  kind = data.kind.toLowerCase();\n}\ncaptures the intention more exactly.\n. Same here\n. It's surprising that this needs to be reversed. I'm assuming that's the way merlin reports it? Could the reverse be pushed further down the stack to keep the higher-level APIs cleaner?\n. You can just import {getOutline} from './OutlineProvider'; at the top of the file. We have a babel transformation in place that will not actually require the file until getOutline is referenced so there is no performance benefit to lazy-requiring explicitly.\n. You're spying on checkOutput on every test and just changing what it returns. To remove boilerplate in each test, and properly unspy, I'd prefer to see, in a beforeEach in the top-level describe:\ncheckOutput = spyOn(require('../process'), 'checkOutput').andCallFake(() => checkOutputReturn);\nwith checkOutput and checkOutputReturn at the top.\nThen unspy it in the afterEach.\nThen in each test just set checkOutputReturn.\n. It seems suspicious that the mocked return value is an object here and a simple string above. It looks like the actual return value isn't used above but still, it's easier to understand later if things are consistent.\n. One more nit -- don't set a default value here, because if one test overrides it and another doesn't, the second one will end up with the value from the first test which is really confusing. Instead, set it to null here (one trick to satisfy Flow is to do something like let checkOutputReturn: TypeAnnotation = (null: any)), then set the default value at the top of the beforeEach.\n. They actually aren't. Hack provides messages to indicate whether the code is \"partially typed\" or \"untyped.\" I don't understand the difference myself.\nTo get some untyped code in Flow just do something like\nconst foo: any = 5;\nconsole.log(foo);\n. This isn't a documented API. We try to limit the number of private APIs we include here. Can you explain why you need it, and why you can't make do with the public APIs?\n. Also a private API. You shouldn't need this. Instead, use atom.views.getView(editor)\n. Also undocumented. See above for how to get the TextEditorElement\n. This is undocumented as well. I don't see why though, it seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to have as part of the public API. I'll let it in since it seems reasonable and there's no obvious non-hacky way to accomplish this using documented APIs.\n. Well, we're already pretty far into undocumented territory here so I'll allow it\n. We do use shrinkwrap, but we like to pin the version here anyway so that only things we are deliberately changing change when we regenerate the shrinkwrap. Please just specify \"4.0.0.\"\n. RequestSerializer::run never returns null or undefined. If the underlying promise resolves to null it will return an object with a null result field.\nInstead you'll need to check linterMessages (below).\nThis change should also change the types in nuclide-diagnostics-common/lib/main.js to reflect the actual lint return type. Then Flow should guide you through the necessary changes.. lol, good try. Why do you need to remove this?. Good call with the early returns here. It reads much better.. Any particular reason why this block happens before the linterMessages null check? Or did you just choose the order arbitrarily?. We prefer to do null/undefined checks explicitly: if (maybe == null). Better to write what you actually mean even though it's a few more characters, rather than relying on truthiness which has some odd quirks.. same here: linterMessages == null. Yeah, that's the one exception we make in our config. It's basically due to Flow's ?something being shorthand for something | null | undefined. Since it's used so pervasively we basically have to conflate null and undefined. Oh well.. I don't really care either way. I don't think it's important. I just wanted to make sure there wasn't some subtlety I was overlooking.. Weird, well Flow knows best I guess. typo (from/form). I've inlined an identifier regex in shouldFilter in this same file -- could you pull that out into a constant and use it here? Notably, what you have here allows numbers at the beginning of an identifier which is incorrect (not a big issue in this case but why not do it right).. is this really still necessary?. Please don't do this. You can just split this line into multiple other lines.. Looks like I can't change the PR, maybe since I don't have push access to your branch?\nAnyway I'm not super picky how you format it. We have a rule on the team that you can't nitpick formatting at review time. If you care enough about anything you can write a lint rule for it. So, anything that passes lint is okay by me.\nI'd suggest something like this:\n((featureConfig.observeAsStream('nuclide-diagnostics-ui.showDiagnosticTraces'): any):\n  Observable<boolean>),. ",
    "bolinfest": "One objection I have to the linter-plus API is that it requires providers to use linter-plus's object model, which is awkward. Looking at https://github.com/steelbrain/Atom-Hack/blob/rewrite/lib/atom-hack.coffee, I'm not comfortable with how Trace or Error is injected. This makes it very hard to write an apm test for your provider.\nBy comparison, autocomplete-plus does not use inheritance or class-based types. It requires providers to return objects with properties of specific types. I think that is much cleaner.\n. I should be able to write a unit test for my linter provider that does not depend on the consumer. If I were to do that today, I would have to mock out constructors for Error and Trace, which makes the test more tedious to write.\nThis is a real issue. Note that today we have to disable our tests for our FlowLinter because we have observed that tests that have to call activatePackage('linter') in beforeEach() are flaky:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/9ed0ce4571baa7ba987118903f7ba3d46692191a/pkg/nuclide/flow/spec/FlowLinter-spec.js#L13-L14\nThis is because linter requires you to get a superclass from the Atom package itself:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/9ed0ce4571baa7ba987118903f7ba3d46692191a/pkg/nuclide/flow/lib/FlowLinter.js#L13\nThe build flakiness is not worth it.\nAlso, passing in constructor functions is not the cleanest thing to do, IMHO. You could just as easily pass in some sort of factory with methods like createError(), etc., that would be cleaner. At least those would be easier to mock.\nFurther, your current contracts are not future-proof. That is, what happens when you want to start adding more parameters, more of which are optional? Your param list will become a mess. It would be easiest to represent each type as an object literal (at least from the provider's perspective) so that the consumer can recognize more properties over time, but older providers will still work.\nIn sum, let providers return object literals, and internally, you can convert them to Error, Trace, etc. Things will be more loosely coupled that way.\n. Fixed in 1fc2358e646d779c9fe9cb39b22b7c21ad61fa6c.\nThough please take note of https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-plus/issues/87.\n. Can you look and see which version of Babel you ended up picking up? I believe we specify it via a range (^5.1.11) rather than a specific version. (cat pkg/nuclide/node-transpiler/node_modules/babel-core/package.json).\nBabel transpilation should be taking care of the trailing comma for us, but it was a pretty experimental feature for Babel, so perhaps it regressed in the version that npm chose to install for you?\n. Flow v0.12.0 was just published a couple of hours ago. Please go and install it and your issues should be fixed!\n. This sounds like an Atom issue rather than a Nuclide issue because they are responsible for both shortcuts. Please re-file against them.\nNote you can also create custom keybindings for Atom, so I would recommend that for a temporary workaround: https://atom.io/docs/latest/using-atom-basic-customization#customizing-key-bindings.\n. Ah, sorry, I mistakenly assumed you were talking about the built-in symbols view. Reopening.\n. I suspect you need watchman installed for this test to pass?\nIt's available on Mac and Linux, but not Windows.\n. And for the nuclide-buck-base tests, you might need to install Buck.\n. Also, is Python 2.x your default Python?\n. Yep, for the nuclide-buck-base tests, you definitely need to install Buck.\n. @adwitama I think we would prefer to modify the scripts so they work in either Python 2.x or 3.x if it's not too difficult. Do you have a feel for how many call sites would need to be modified?\nIf it's just that one filter() call, it doesn't seem like it should be too hard.\n. Hi everyone, I made two commits today that I think should help with many of the problems that people have been running into:\n- 690e0df6b04750c9fe995c89009cd6fcc57ba45f makes it so ./scripts/dev/setup can be run with either Python 2 or Python 3.\n- 5903a22d3e0e7f79ea608531f0e37678e9d9c7cd fixes it so it can be run on Windows. There is no need to run it as administrator! (I would actively discourage you from doing so.)\nOne other issue that I ran into myself when testing these on Linux and Windows is that, depending on how Atom was installed, I might have to run ./scripts/dev/setup as root/administrator because the ~/.atom/packages directory required root/administrator access to write to it. If you find yourself in this situation, I would fix your file permissions for the entire ~/.atom directory so it requires only ordinary user permissions.\nAssuming you don't have much in the way of state/preferences/packages in your ~/.atom directory and you're not sure what the easiest way to fix the permissions is, you might just want to blow it away and let Atom re-create it when you start it as non-root/administrator.\n. I think that all of the posts on this thread were known issues that are now fixed:\n- @jurosh @flyingfeet @aewing Previously ./scripts/dev/setup did not work on Windows.\n- @tachyons @ml @hknd Perhaps npm was not on your $PATH? Or ~/.npm requires root to write to it? I would fix your file permissions rather than running all sorts of stuff as root.\n- @adwitama Previously ./scripts/dev/setup did not work with Python 3.\nI'm going to close this out. Please reopen if the fixes do not work for you.\n. @itchina110 What happens when you try to run that npm install command manually from the command line?\n. @itchina110 It also appears that all of this code is in your Trash directory?\napm link /Users/yubo/.Trash/nuclide-master/pkg/nuclide/language-hack\nThat seems weird.\n. @itchina110 I would try git clean -xfd as you may have gotten into a bad state and then run the setup script again.\n. For anyone who is still having problems, make sure that git is available from the command line. At least that was the solution for https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/56.\nI am in the process of updating the root README.md to reflect this.\nIt turns out that this is necessary because one of our transitive Node deps is git+https://github.com/kevinsawicki/jasmine-node.git#81af4f953a2b7dfb5bde8331c05362a4b464c5ef, so npm install requires git.\n. I think that something else in your toolchain was, arguably erroneously, installed with sudo if you need sudo to run Nuclide's setup script. As such, we will not take this change.\n. Now that Nuclide is public, hopefully resources like http://nuclide.io/ and https://code.facebook.com/posts/397706937084869 help clarify things, but if not, let me be clear:\n- Nuclide is not a fork of Atom.\n- Nuclide is a set of packages to add IDE-like functionality to Atom. In particular, we're focused on developing packages to support the technologies we use at Facebook, which includes (but is not limited to) React [Native], Hack, and Mercurial. We are committed to providing open source code that we use internally at Facebook to ensure it is of high quality and does not get stale.\n- For technologies that we do not use at Facebook, we try to provide extension points that others can use for building packages for their own technologies. A prominent example of this is hyperclick, as packages for other programming languages will likely also want to provide click-to-symbol functionality.\n- If, over time, some of Nuclide's packages are merged into the core of Atom, that's great. If not, that's cool too, since we will continue to develop and make them available as a suite of packages. (We hope that hyperclick will be such a package, which is why it does not have the nuclide- prefix like our other packages do.)\n- Currently, for end-users, we provide Nuclide via nuclide-installer because Atom does not currently support a way to declare Atom packages as dependencies of other Atom packages. If Atom ultimately supports the ability to install a suite of packages, we'll happily use that API.\n. In the latest version of Atom, they took away a hidden, undocumented property that we were using. Our next export to GitHub will include that and other fixes.\n. I'm going to close this as #wontfix.\n. We also need https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7022 to be accepted by GitHub so we can support this for remote directories, as well.\n. This has been fixed!\n. Is python 2.x your default?\nOn Wednesday, June 10, 2015, Andrew Ewing notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI am also seeing this issue on Ubuntu 14.10 when trying to run sudo\n./scripts/dev/setup for the 2nd time.

FYI, it is this transitive dependency in a package.json that causes the issue:\n\n\n\"jasmine-node\": \"git+https://github.com/kevinsawicki/jasmine-node.git#81af4f953a2b7dfb5bde8331c05362a4b464c5ef\",\nSo npm install doesn't normally need Git, but for this dependency, it does.\nI'm updating the System Requirements to reflect this.\n. @milesj Yes! I moved our test runner (that depends on jasmine-focused, which depends on git+https://github.com/kevinsawicki/jasmine-node.git#81af4f953a2b7dfb5bde8331c05362a4b464c5ef) into a new nuclide-jasmine package, which is now listed under devDependencies in all of our package.json files as of https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/33ffc40e2d8178f921d4a5319ba70133d659a474.\nIf you use npm install --production, it will not try to install devDependencies. This is good for end-users because apm install calls npm install --production. However, we assume that developers are trying to develop, so we don't want to exclude devDependencies when npm install is called from ./scripts/dev/setup.\nSo I'm not sure if this fixes things for you in the developer case, but it will fix things for users who install the prebuilt packages via Atom and do not have Git on their $PATH.\n. @hknd What is the version in /usr/share/atom/resources/app/node_modules/babel-core/package.json?\nMaybe the ^5.1.1 version we specify for babel is not high enough and we just happen to be using a newer version? I'm a little confused because babel-core is getting loaded from someplace that is not under nuclide-server.\n. @hknd So is everything working now? If so, can we close this?\n. Yes, you should re-run ./scripts/dev/setup when you update your Nuclide repo. Some people have run into problems if you ran the script as root at some point, so don't do that :)\nAlso, when in doubt, run git clean -xfd to blow away all of the symlinks and things that the setup script creates.\n. This looks similar to https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/56. Do you have git on your $PATH?\n. Yesterday, I fixed a case where Windows uses %USERNAME% instead of $USER: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/e6318eaf2da834c6437425574ba6aa5a31ebe5a0.\nWhich should be used in place of $HOME on Windows? %HOMEPATH%? %USERPROFILE%?\n. I believe we want to do:\nvar homeDir = process.env['HOME'] || process.env['USERPROFILE'];\n. Fixed in 83d22d6237bfe7bc76181610d754c3bd59f5fdfe.\n. Always running git clean -xfd before running ./scripts/dev/setup will make it run considerably slower. A \"noop\" build takes 20s, but a clean build takes 42s.\nI run this every time I switch branches or pull (which is often) and it works fine without cleaning in between for me. If there is a bug that prevents it from working incrementally, then we should fix it.\n. Duplicate of #38, which has been fixed. I suspect you need to pull and re-run the setup script.\n. Is this the first time you installed the tree or every time? Currently, the first time you open Atom after installing Nuclide, it has to transpile a number of Babel .js files, but those transpilations are cached, so subsequent loads should be much faster.\nAnd how large are the root folders that you are opening (in terms of number of file entries)?\n. We have made some critical fixes that should improve this. Can you try again with the latest Nuclide?\n- Watchman performance fix: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/2318277b3d84a8868ba69d4fd761d27a46e10fd7\n- More efficient use of React in the file tree: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/3d55c9037d1c08cb6c5e1cce457b01d1dbcc5648\n(Note the React fix did not make it into Nuclide v0.0.24, but it will make it into the next versioned release.)\n/cc @ssorallen \n. What's the result of ls -al /Users/andrejbadin/Code/nuclide/pkg/nuclide/server/node_modules/nuclide-clang such that it cannot be removed?\n. To confirm, you're using cmd-t to use Nuclide's file opener rather than cmd-p for Atom's, correct?\nApproximately how many files is Chromium, and are you on an SSD?\n. Hmm, do you have Watchman v3.2.0 or later installed? We call that out as required for our Mecurial support, but perhaps we missed that here?\n. @simonwelsh How about you? ~30,000 files doesn't seem like all that much. Though from our testing, 500,000 files should also work. (I think it should take 30s at most to initially index the path names.)\nCould there be any weird symlink loops that we are not traversing responsibly?\n. OK, so currently it seems like we have two separate issues here:\n1. @simonwelsh We should update our setup instructions to tell people to install Watchman. (Though I want to double-check that that is what fixed things for you.)\n2. @jacobdufault We should either pre-transpile our Babel files or provide better tolerance for this type of error (or be sure to choose a temp directory that is on the same device as the babel-cache directory).\n. Are you on Windows, Mac, or Linux? Anything else about your system that might be special?\n. The nuclide-installer package goes through and runs apm install for each package in https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-installer/blob/master/lib/config.json. We're getting some reports that this is very, very slow. I'm also checking with GitHub to see if there's anything on their end that could be contributing to this.\n. You could experiment with installing each package through Atom's GUI to see if the behavior is any different. I need to dig into the code in settings-view to see if anything extra special happens there.\n. If you backup your ~/.atom/packages directory, that's the easiest way to remove all of your packages.\n. I was doing some monitoring, and it seems like Atom sends individual requests to atom.io for every third-party package you have installed to see if you have the latest version of the package or not. Obviously when you have Nuclide installed, you have a lot of packages, so all of these requests (and presumably DOM updates as the requests come back) seem to be what upset Atom. Presumably things would be better if Atom had a batch API for this. /cc @thedaniel @nathansobo \n. Closing as @jamesgpearce explained the current status.\n. @RamIdeas I believe this is because you do not have git on your %PATH%, as required by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/#building-from-source. As noted in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/56#issuecomment-119373196, I have removed the git requirement for end-users of Nuclide, but it still applies for people who are trying to hack on Nuclide itself.\n. Hi there, if you're comfortable tweaking the code, can you let me know if the following fixes things for you:\nGo to https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/48b6dd525fdad10a63f412e42521bd163b9563a8/pkg/nuclide/remote-connection/lib/SshHandshake.js#L110\nand modify it from:\njs\nagent: process.env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK,\nto:\nagent: process.env['SSH_AUTH_SOCK'] || 'pageant',\nIf that works for you, then I'll commit that to the repo.\n. No problem -- thanks for testing! Proper fix in 7262b88599ba4dbf7396d33b7d2718a048c9f8d9.\n. I'm not sure that's our code doing that. I don't think we, or any of our transitive deps, would have you fetch atom-shell?\n. @Fatxx If apm updates the version of Node that is bundled with it, then I'll update the setup scripts to use the version of Node that is bundled with apm, which should make the setup scripts simpler to run.\n@reflog Today, the setup scripts will use whatever version of Node is on your $PATH, so install Node v0.12.x yourself via https://nodejs.org/ and make sure it appears before any other versions of Node you have on your $PATH.\n. I'm going to close this issue because installing Nuclide alongside Atom 1.0 works.\nI'm not sure if there's still an outstanding problem here, but if so, feel free to create a new GitHub issue with a title identifying the specific problem.\n. The linter package has gone through quite a bit of change recently. I believe that one change is that you have to modify the file before it triggers the linter.\nI realize this is a confusing user experience (I have also been confused), so we're going to be working with the linter maintainers to make sure that we have the APIs we need to create the right experience.\n. In the most recent release of Nuclide, here is the line of code that installs each package:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/installer-base/lib/main.js#L212\nOffhand, I would expect that to work on Windows, but that does involve shelling out to apm, so I guess that's not a guarantee?\n. What happens if you run 'npm install' from the nuclide/node-transpiler package after running setup?\n. @Keno just to save us the trouble of auditing: which APIs are you worried are not Python >= 2.6 compliant?\n. @despairblue No, the latest version is 0.0.24. We removed v0.1.0. Unfortunately, hyperclick was originally on a different numbering scheme than the rest of Nuclide.\n. I'll aim to push one out this weekend. I just exported a bunch of new code\nto GitHub.\nOn Wed, Jul 29, 2015 at 3:02 PM, Naman Goel notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nAny update on a new Nuclide release?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/139#issuecomment-126109588.\n. @nmn Nuclide v0.0.25 is out!\n. @alanrsoares I'm confused where you're claiming the problem is. What version of the linter package are you using?\n. Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but is this a problem building Atom or Nuclide?\n. Ah, since this says \"Atom not building on OS X,\" you should file this against Atom rather than Nuclide.\n. I believe this should be fixed by https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7996 because we need to use a newer version of Babel to get a bug fix.\n. Atom v1.0.3 is out. Please upgrade and reopen if that does not fix the issue.\n. Do you have Watchman installed?\n. Can you try the newest version of Nuclide (both server and client), v0.0.26? We've made some startup fixes.\n. Are you sure that all of the packages installed via nuclide-installer have finished installing?\n. What is in C:\\Users\\Christian\\.atom\\packages\\nuclide-quick-open\\node_modules\\nuclide-client\\node_modules\\nuclide-server\\node_modules\\event-kit\\node_modules\\grim\\node_modules\\emissary? Is there a node_modules with an underscore_plus directory?\n. @arsenx I believe the error you are seeing in the quick open dialog is due to the \"untitled\" editor pane you have open. Under the hood, we are probably calling atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor().getPath(), which is failing.\n\nWe need to add a null check, but for now, maybe closing the pane will fix your immediate issue?\n. @ChristianGrech Yes, but does C:\\Users\\Christian\\.atom\\packages\\nuclide-quick-open\\node_modules\\nuclide-client\\node_modules\\nuclide-server\\node_modules\\event-kit\\node_modules\\grim\\node_modules\\emissary\\node_modules exist? Or is there ancestor folder with a node_modules that has a copy of underscore in it?\nI'm curious if something did not get installed properly. You could try doing the following to fix it:\ncd C:\\Users\\Christian\\.atom\\packages\\nuclide-quick-open\\node_modules\\nuclide-client\\node_modules\\nuclide-server\\node_modules\\event-kit\\node_modules\\grim\\node_modules\\emissary\\\nnpm install\n. @arsenx Did you follow all of the instructions on http://nuclide.io/docs/remote/ for setting up your remote server?\n. Ah, @arsenx, I think you're going to have a problem with local projects because Watchman is not available for Windows...yet: https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/19.\nFlow isn't available for Windows, and our Mercurial support also depends on Watchman. Currently, the biggest value add we provide for Windows users is the ability to connect to a remote nix machine and edit files there where our other tools that depend on nix are installed.\n. @arsenx Yes, I believe it is. I thought we updated the docs to make that clear. I can't find evidence that we did :(\nAdmittedly, it's a bit of work to even trace through the dependencies to deduce this:\n- nuclide-quick-open depends on nuclide-client\n- NuclideClient provides a doSearchQuery method that maps to a /search/query path.\n- In nuclide-server, there is a services-config.json file that has an entry for our legacy service framework for lib/services/NuclideSearchService.js.\n- In lib/services/NuclideSearchService.js, you can see where the mapping for /search/query occurs.\n- NuclideSearchService.js depends on nuclide-path-search.\n- nuclide-path-search depends on nuclide-watchman-helpers.\n- The final piece of the puzzle is https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/b16f67a/pkg/nuclide/path-search/lib/PathSetUpdater.js#L15-L17\n/cc @jssln Do you remember us updating this somewhere? Maybe we only did this for the Mercurial package?\n. Is there anything of interest in /tmp/nuclide-<YOUR USERNAME>-logs/?\n. Here is the fix for quick open crashing on the \"undefined\" editor tab: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/eb0e3aeb7fbe969d387f7c76d379dfc0d70b358e\n. @arsenx Awesome: glad you got that sorted out! We'll have to update our brew recipe so people fall into the pit of success.\n. @ChristianGrech Hmm, that seems odd then. Though we had at least one anecdotal report of problems on Windows when paths are too long? Specifically from https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/23:\n\nFirstly I had issue with long path - longer that allowed on Windows OS.\nThis issue is fixed in NPM somehow but in your python script it's not.\nI temporary solved this by moving it closer to core path.\n\nMaybe that is the case here?\n. Are you still the owner of the file? Are you running the server as yourself or root?\n. @arsenx Thanks for the detailed bug report! I suspect this was introduced by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/32bdf743e423b3643b464a43080954a91542f7d1. I'll get a fix out ASAP.\nWhat Linux distro are you running the server on? I'm curious if there's anything special about your temp directory.\n. @arsenx I believe that https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/b16f67a0216d6f7483a25c585a5a17d7470569ba should fix your issue if you're willing to build nuclide-server from source.\n. @arsenx I'm pushing v0.0.26 out right now.\n. v0.0.26 is out. Closing. Feel free to reopen if you still see an issue.\n. This is a challenge to fix.\nThe reason why it works locally is because there is a GitRepository object that is bundled with Atom core rather than in its own npm package:\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/git-repository.coffee\nOne of its core dependencies is the npm package git-utils, which contains native code:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/git-utils\nSo I'm not sure how difficult it would be to extract GitRepository into its own npm package.\nIf it exists as its own npm package, then we can make it a dependency of nuclide-server and run it there, just like we do with our Mercurial dependencies.\n. I don't know that we have the bandwidth to fix https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8207 ourselves right now, and it is directly on the critical path for a real fix here. If you can get that fixed, then I'd be happy to wire it up to nuclide-server.\n. Yes! We haven't made it part of a public release yet, but if you build from source, try nuclide-file-tree-deux: it is much, much faster.\nIt lacks VCS integration at the moment, but we're working on it.\n. Probably when we have Git support since we don't want to regress folks.\nI've posted About this on some of the other issues, but given how atom\npackage installation works today, it's honestly faster and takes up much\nless disk to build Nuclide from source than to do an official install.\nWe're working to make that better, though.\nOn Saturday, September 26, 2015, Nester notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@bolinfest https://github.com/bolinfest great! Sounds cool \ud83d\ude00 Are you\nplanning to add it to public releases? If yes, then when?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/159#issuecomment-143470493.\n. This is a Facebook-specific issue. Please report internally.\n. We started pre-transpiling the .js in v0.0.28 with the expectation that the server should start up faster now that it no longer has to transpile on the fly.\n. Hmm, it appears that nuclide-buck-base/lib/BuckUtils.js was transpiled whereas it should not have been.\n. All of the other services that were not supposed to be transpiled according to services-config.json were left alone as intended, though.\n\nA quick fix is to edit nuclide-server/services-config.json and remove the following:\n{\n    \"definition\": \"nuclide-buck-base/lib/BuckUtils.js\",\n    \"implementation\": \"nuclide-buck-base/lib/LocalBuckUtils.js\",\n    \"name\": \"BuckUtils\",\n    \"useServiceFramework\": true\n  },\n. Ah, I see what happened. There are two entries for nuclide-buck-base:\n{\n    \"definition\": \"nuclide-buck-base/lib/BuckUtils.js\",\n    \"implementation\": \"nuclide-buck-base/lib/LocalBuckUtils.js\",\n    \"name\": \"BuckUtils\",\n    \"useServiceFramework\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"definition\": \"nuclide-buck-base/lib/BuckProject.js\",\n    \"implementation\": \"nuclide-buck-base/lib/LocalBuckProject.js\",\n    \"name\": \"BuckProject\",\n    \"useServiceFramework\": true\n  },\nOne clobbered the other.\n. https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/e26aafa7caa99f134dfd1f689bda75330da71c02 is the fix for this. Doing a release now.\n. I was doing something funny with Atom and didn't have apm installed when I ran the publish script, so all of the Node packages successfully deployed, but the Atom packages did not. I'm fixing that now.\n. nuclide-installer@0.0.29 is now available! Please close this if everything works for you again.\n. My bad: I broke this with https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/45463ccc3ae19635e06e27c817584afe6ffb6980. react-for-atom should have been listed in dependencies rather than devDependencies.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/cbe63210b541130790d695d313e7dd104c047e68. Pushing a release now.\n. I was thinking about this last night: thanks for calling us out on it. I'll backfill some notes for the flurry of releases in the last 48 hours.\n. It's live!\n. Why does it depend on atom-linter?\nhttps://github.com/steelbrain/package-deps/blob/master/package.json#L22-L24\n. @steelbrain Moving it out sounds like a good idea.\nAlso, if the user has the package installed, but has chosen to disable it, do you force them to re-enable it? I ask because:\nhttps://github.com/steelbrain/package-deps/blob/master/lib/main.js#L20-L23\nAlso, since you're using Babel, you could use async/await to avoid those then() calls.\n. Also, I'm not sure that you need a class when you only have static methods in main.js.\n. We decided to go in a different direction here. https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/dbe5b5fb8fd7f2bee134e954fe9a2c2a8e53309e explains how and why.\nFurther, I suspect that we're going to need to do some more work with our custom installation to address https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8217.\n. Yes, this is a serious issue. I think the problem needs to be fixed in Atom rather than Nuclide. I filed an issue to track this at https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8217.\n. Until https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8217 is fixed, it's honestly much more efficient to build and install from source than it is via apm.\n. What package were you using to see ESLint errors? This should just work with the Nuclide package.\n. @admmasters We have docs on this in a couple of places now:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/master/pkg/nuclide/diagnostics#readme\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/master/pkg/nuclide/diagnostics/store#readme\n. I'm going to exclude nuclide-debugger-node from nuclide-installer until we can get this fixed: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/e14160d26ebe532753384cd4ac6b6b3678a8515d. I'm in the process of pushing v0.0.32 of Nuclide now.\n. The hashlib.sha1() code was a recent addition: we'll have to make something up that is compliant with Python 2 and 3. (Most of us use Python 2.7 by default since we're on OS X.)\nIn the meantime, you could probably comment that chunk of code out (or fix it!): it exists to avoid unnecessary calls to npm install, so it's not required for correctness, but it does speed things up dramatically.\n. Honestly, until https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8217 is fixed, installing Nuclide from source is much, much more efficient because it goes down from taking up O(N^2) to O(N) space and installation time.\n. Hmm, we should make sure to update our brew recipe since we're on Flow 0.16.0 and there are some pretty important improvements:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/Changelog.md#v0150\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/Changelog.md#v0160\n. From the error, I'm guessing that Flow either wrote something to stdout that it should not have, or it segfaulted and the error was written to stdout, which was unsurprisingly not JSON.\nClosing assuming this is a transient issue. Feel free to reopen if you can repro.\n. If you are on OS X, I think you need to upgrade Xcode to get the new version of Command Line Tools.\n. The following packages use hyperclick:\nhttps://atom.io/packages/nuclide-buck-files\nhttps://atom.io/packages/nuclide-clang-atom\nhttps://atom.io/packages/nuclide-flow\nhttps://atom.io/packages/nuclide-hack\nhttps://atom.io/packages/nuclide-ocaml\nIn particular, nuclide-flow gets its information about JavaScript from Flow. Where does the information for determining location definitions in js-hyperclick come from?\n. I don't think we're going to fix this. hyperclick used to do this, but performance was terrible because every time you press the ctrl (or cmd) key, we have to query all of the providers. So if you do ctrl-left or ctrl-right to arrow through a bunch of words, you rack up all of these calls to hyperclick providers and everything grinds to a halt.\nSo I'm not saying this is unsolvable, but one has to be very, very careful about how this is fixed or it will destroy performance.\n. I thought we [historically, at least] exposed this via a setting?\n. Is this Windows or something else?\n. We have a changelog.md in the uber Nuclide repo, no?\nOn Friday, November 27, 2015, Ross Allen notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for bringing this up, and I like the idea of adding a CHANGELOG.

Will path.isAbsolute() properly exclude remote paths?\n. Check out nuclide-datatip.provider, right @jgebhardt?\n. Originally, Nuclide was implemented and distributed this way, but due to some details of how the Node/Atom ecosystem work, this was unsustainable: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8217. This caused issues such as https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/203.\n\nThe reality is that we can move a lot faster and deliver a better overall experience by developing in a monolithic repository and releasing as a single package.\nIf you go to Nuclide's settings, you can disable individual features that would normally be their own Atom packages if there were a reasonable way to distribute them as such.\n. I landed some of the initial code for this yesterday, but there's still a\nlot of work left to do and we're trying to find someone to own it.\nOn Saturday, October 1, 2016, Cristian Cede\u00f1o notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nQuestion:\nHow i can debug python in nuclide?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/758, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAoB_a6k0G_3PxOMVl68mKkkP4j24Bdgks5qv0u3gaJpZM4KL8eN\n.\n. \n",

Please upgrade Atom and Nuclide and file another issue if you still experience this.\n. This is due to another package using a second instance of React. Most likely the culprit is atom-typescript, which uses react@0.13 rather than react-for-atom: https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/package.json\n. Yes, that should work.

You are running an outdated version of Atom. Atom won't offer to upgrade packages that require a higher version of Atom than what you have installed.\nUpgrade to at least Atom 1.13 (1.14.0, released today, should work as well). You should be seeing package upgrades. Please re-open this issue if that did not fix it.. Does this happen when the todo-show package is deactivated?. The minimum required Atom version for Nuclide 206+ is 1.14.2. Update your Atom and you should see Nuclide in the list of available package updates.. Hi @ev1stensberg, the sample-* packages are disabled by default.\nYou can enable them via Atom Settings > Packages > Nuclide > (scroll to the bottom) Enable the \"sample-*\" feature. Let us know if that doesn't work for you.. @ev1stensberg Check out Nuclide's observeProcess and all the various other abstractions around spawning processes: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/commons-node/process.js#L467-L472. @ev1stensberg that sounds awesome. What exactly \"doesn't cut it\"?\nRegarding conventions, it's hard to say without seeing what specifically you're doing, but a few things to keep in mind:\n- Any calls to the file system, local processes etc have to be remoted using the Nuclide RPC framework (since Nuclide works transparently on both local and remote repos). This will already necessitate the use of the Atom Services API\n- We highly prefer the re-use of existing abstractions & services (e.g. the diagnostics UI, quick-open, etc) over one-off UIs\n- We loosely favor Observables over Promises for APIs, but it's not a hard-and-fast rule.\nDo you have any rough drafts or outlines to share? . @niilante What are you trying to do here?. v0.214.0 is the latest release and was published 5 days ago ( https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/releases/tag/v0.214.0).\nYou should be able to install it from Atom 1.14.0+.\nLet us know if anything is unclear!. What is the set of accepted kind values? I think standardizing, or at least publicly documenting, the set of possible values will be important for making the feature work reliably across multiple themes and providers.\nSince there's no validation that the \"kind name\" is actually a valid css className (e.g. that it doesn't contain whitespace), I'd suggest simplifying this API to allow passing a classname rather than kind in the outline- this will at least make the className semantics clear. The above point about standardization would still apply though.. Hi @lifeiscontent, sorry for the delay! To answer your questions (and in case anyone else is wondering):\n1) No, you don't need to follow the Nuclide package guide for regular Atom packages. However, many of the recommendations (ie., everything besides the package creation script and the import vs require guidance) still hold true for non-Nuclide Atom packages.\n2) I believe pulling in nuclide as a dev dependency and using import type is the way to go for now. It's not ideal but currently your best bet.\n3) Thanks! I'm curious, how did your test runner project go?\n. \ud83d\udc4d  @crucialfelix note that Nuclide didn't fully support Atom 1.18 at the time, which was likely the cause here.. open-recent likely does not understand remote URLs.. @jinjorge did this resolve after reloading Nuclide/Atom?. Did the error resolve after you finished updating all packages? . Seems like potentially a bug in Atom's TextBuffer on Windows.. Nuclide v0.245 is about 12 releases / 10 weeks behind; does this still repro for you after upgrading to the current version?. Hi, thank you for the suggestion! We don't currently have bandwidth to tackle this, but if anyone is interested in building this, we'd be open to a PR. Thanks!. Does this still repro with a more current Nuclide version such as 0.321?. Ah, thanks. Sorry about that! Check out https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/1512#issuecomment-385614316 for a likely workaround.. Try updating the nuclide package - we just pushed v0.362.0, which should fix the fb-appsession-observer issue.. @ggeldenhuis the console font is a separate setting from the Atom editor font. Try setting it via Atom's settings > Packages > Nuclide > Terminal > Font Family. Let us know if that doesn't work. Thanks!. Looks like the error is being thrown in the SFTP-deployment package. Try disabling that package if you keep encountering issues. Closing, since this issue is outside of Nuclide's purview.. ",

I think it is generally considered bad practice to use sudo to install npm packages.  Our setup script should not require sudo.\n. Thanks for the pull request.

Older node versions would only bind to ipv4 if '::' was not specified.  Let me test this pull request on a few different platforms.  If it works it will be merged.\n. This does in fact break ipv6.  It seems the correct solution is to start 2 servers one on each address family.\n. Wait, I think something screwy was going on on my box.  This may be ok.  Still testing.\n. This does work on node 0.12.X.  It binds to both ipv4 and ipv6.  We will pull this in.  Thanks!\n. @nmn Did this start working for you?\n. According to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31304593/remote-server-setup-nuclide-start-server-command-doesnt-work it sounds like setuptools might be broken?

Is port 9090 accessible on your VM from your host?\n. It looks good to me, but will test and get back to you Monday.\n. Checked against several versions of python in both the 2.X series and the 3.X series and this patch works like a charm.  I think there is just one tiny merge conflict.

Hm. I don't think this issue is related to permissions.\nAfter a while, I managed to get (most of) it working, but it was very tedious. I had to go through each package in nuclide, and manually run npm install or npm install <missing dependency> while reloading Atom in the background looking for errors on missing modules.\nI think npm may be skipping installing some packages because it sees that the directories are linked (I get many messages about skipped actions while running npm install manually on a nuclide package).\n.

Thanks for the reply @zertosh.  I did the clone -> npm install -> apm link and still don't see the build and simulator buttons at the top of the UI as shown at this point in the video (https://youtu.be/X0VH78ye4yY?t=1383).

I then removed all of them except of the ~/.atom/packages/nuclide link and restarted atom.  Still no luck on the build and simulator buttons.

    "zertosh": "Hm, I just took a quick look at the video and a lot of functionality is already there - albeit, really poorly documented. We have some release issues (like how do we deal with a ton of pre-existing Nuclide packages) to sort out before we publish UP to the atom registry, but it's totally usable right now by cloning -> npm install -> apm link.\n. Your build needs to be setup with Buck\n. @istarkov, try cloning this repo, then opening the nuclide source directory in Atom, and going to pkg/nuclide/arcanist/lib/main.js. Then try cmd+click over '../../busy-signal-provider-base' or over '../../busy-signal-interfaces';. I just tried on that file using flow 0.20.1 and it works.\n. I wonder if Atom respects the issues orbugs field in the package.json. If so, we can just point it nuclide. If not, maybe we can upstream that change.\n. @jacobmischka woops, sorry, I didn't realize issues were off. I made facebooknuclide/hyperclick#3. I'll try to do the sync now. The idea is to remove Hyperclick from Nuclide, and have the Hyperclick package be the source of truth.\n. Published as hyperclick@v0.0.39\n. You don't really need Python\n. :+1: \n. I had a different fix for this and few other windows problems. It was something along the lines of modifiedPath.split(path.sep). But I'll accept this for now :+1: \n. :star2: :+1: :star2: \n. Because he made the comment on the commit itself and not on a line in the commit.\n. squash :stuck_out_tongue: \n. This is the same issue as with the internal package formerly known as fb-snippets. Atom assumes in several places that the package directory name is the package name. Working around it at the loader level would only hide the problem. The real solution is to rename the directories of features to their package.json name \u2013 aka flatten the directory structure.\n. @ssorallen That would be a problem. We'll have to ask the Atom team if we can publish, then unpublish, a package to de facto blacklist the name. Otherwise, the Settings -> Install view would remain crazy crowded (like it is now - before we unpublish).\n. We caught this same issue internally with someone running file-watcher. The plan is to flatten /pkg so each directory is the actual feature name. Since I don't think hg will rebase file moves, we'll have to see how many outstanding diffs there are to figure when the least disruptive time is for this codemod.\n. The fix should come out this week. The work around is to deactivate the package whose name is conflicting. In the case of the OP, he must have a package called \"blame\" that once deactivated allows nuclide to start. Whatever the error message is, the name after the \"nuclide-\" is the conflicting package.\n. I apologize for the hold up on this. The workaround is to disable whatever package you have installed that matches one of these directory names https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/master/pkg/nuclide. Then if you don't want that particular Nuclide feature, disable it from Settings -> Packages -> nuclide -> Settings -> 'Enable the \"xxx\" feature', then re-enable the package that clashed with the name.\nThe real fix for this won't be in tomorrows release, but may be in the following one.\n. The fix is in 2057807, we're aiming for a release tomorrow. Sorry for the long wait on this. As you can see, the change was not trivial.\n. @rulatir I'm seeing that after the update is complete. Reloading Atom seems to make everything work again. Have you tried that?\n. This can happen for multiple reasons. The reason for it happening immediately after an upgrade, but not after restarting Atom, is because when Atom updates a package, it doesn't actually clear the require cache. So unless very specific conditions are met, you end up loading the same modules as pre-update from memory but with a different disk layout.\nThe solution we're going to implement, which is similar to VS Code's, is to require a restarting the editor after an upgrade. In the case of Nuclide, we won't force you to reload, but the update will refuse to load until you've restarted (showing you a notification of course).\n. @jhohlfeld- you mean you don't see a toolbar? That's odd. Please open a new issue.\n. And I'd be more than happy to approve it!\n. cc: @nmote\n. That package is deprecated, and the error likely happened because github was down earlier. Please remove nuclide-installer and use nuclide instead.\n. Next weeks release won't have any more binary dependencies so this won't be an issue.\n. Yup (see https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/releases/tag/v0.126.0). That went out at 2016-03-25T00:08:37Z. So ~7hrs ago.\n. cc: @hansonw \n. That's not really a use case we're aiming to support. Sorry.\n. cc: @shushz\n. cc: @yinghuitan\n. Seems like this was fixed. See https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/480#issuecomment-215628186.

Oh, hey @eeree, can you make the PR against docs in master and not the gh-pages branch please? Thanks!\n. I can't repro. What version of Atom/Nuclide are you running? Did you have any files open?\n. Closing since the issue was fixed by an update.\n. @facebook-github-bot import\n. Thanks @eeree!\n. I took another look at this and I remembered the original problem with the minified version. It's react-dom and friends. But I think that if we use the dist version of react and react-dom loaded at the same time, we're ok. I have to test this. The other issue is with addons like the pure-render-mixin. We're going to end up with duplicate code loaded, but I think it's minimal.\n. I believe the @peterhal got rid of this. @Vahanerevan can you try nuclide@0.131.0?\n. This is an issue with how Atom handles updates. If you restart Atom, it'll work again.\n. @sicum I can't repro. Have you tried restarting Atom?\n. Closing due to lack of activity.\n. cc: @shushz\n. We haven't added debug binaries for Node v6 yet. Maybe in next weeks release. If you start your React Native project with Node v4 or v5, it'll work.\n. @RinatMullayanov, I'm aware of the problem, I suggest you try Node v4 or v5.\n@matthewwithanm, we need to add v8-debug and v8-profiler for node 6. I took a quick look at this last week and it's not as simple as adding the bins. There are (minor) changes to the v8-debug binary that mean we also have to update the v8-debug js, and node-inspector. I'll take a look again today, but I don't know if you're actively touching the node-inspector/v8-debug/v8-profiler code.\n. It was f60e755db8c1d1d7c1050fd9876349b544ebf4ae\n. Docs are incorrect, sorry. We target the same Node version that is bundled with the Atom version we support. Currently it's Atom 1.7.4 and Node 5.1.1, https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/2813c84/package.json#L106-L109.\n. @facebook-github-bot import\n. Thanks! I made some small style changes and landed it internally. It should go out in this weeks release.\n. Looks like two packages may be trying to use different versions of React. @nmn can you run grep -r --include='package.json' '\"react-for-atom\"' ~/.atom/packages to see which packages it is?\n. We found the problem. The version of react-for-atom that hyperclick@0.0.36 was using had this issue https://github.com/jgebhardt/react-for-atom/issues/13. I just published hyperclick@0.0.37 with the fixed react-for-atom. If you updated hyperclick and reload Atom, you should be fine.\n. flow-bin and the wrapper script solve different problems, and we should support both - as in they work with Nuclide and the Flow team maintains them.\nflow-bin\nThe security problem is easy to overcome. Nuclide can have a list of blessed checksums, that we regularly update as flow versions come out. Before running flow-bin/flow, we verify the checksum, and either refuse to run it if it doesn't match, or warn the user and ask for permission.\nMy problem with flow-bin is that it downloads the flow binary instead of shipping with it. This has has problems:\n- it doesn't use npm's proxy settings (so it complicates installs in envs like Sandcastle),\n- it doesn't install if you have ignore-scripts=true,\n- the deps it needs to download flow are larger than the flow bins themselves, so installs are fat and take longer than necessary.\nIMHO, flow-bin should just package all the platform bins, and skip the download.\nThe wrapper script\nI wanted to open source it but legal issues. I have it sitting in a private repo ready to be published to npm. It's more-or-less the script we used internally (before it supported semver), and a publishing script that downloads all the flow versions for all platforms before packaging. The idea was that you'd run npm -g install flow-versions, it would be a (currently) ~250mb install, but then you'd have a script in /usr/local/bin/flow that works in any setup.\nThe wrapper script is not for everyone (given how large it is). I see it as a compliment to flow-bin. Akin to having a global eslint install.\n. cc: @nmote\n. The line should def be highlighted cc: @nmote. As for the tooltips/resizing, agreed. We had that before but had to switch away from FixedDataTable to a simple html table in order to upgrade our Atom support, and haven't revisited the issue.\n. re line 28, after talking it through with @nmote, his explanation makes sense. Nuclide is just following what flow reports, so maybe you should file an issue for that there.\nThough I agree that the table could definite use some love :)\n. Closing since this seems resolved by existing functionality.\n. That package appears to be deprecated. The file-tree already has a \"Show In Finder\" functionality. Try disabling show-in-system to see if our \"Show In Finder\" works for you.\n. There's an option in Nuclide's settings to enable \"lint-on-the-fly\" for legacy linters. But this is something don't offer for Flow (I suspect) because constantly polling flow isn't a good experience perf-wise. @nmote is this correct?\n. The problem is that something is echoing Your ssh agent is not running, you will not be able to log into other hosts while Nuclide is trying to ssh. Maybe something in your bashrc? Unfortunately, with the way we exchange keys, nothing can output anything, or it'll throw off SFTP.\n. When we tried to land this, it failed the flow check, and the \"nuclide deactivates cleanly\" integration test (and will fail the lint check). First, rebase past 8632e79 (just landed). Then:\n-  In SwiftPMTaskRunnerToolbar.js fix the lint warnings. We treat all lint issues as warnings so we can distinguish them from flow errors, but they're both land blocking.

I can't repro. And the line that's throwing the error is https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/d5c1bd0/lib/main.js#L34-L35. That can only happen if Nuclide is not running in the renderer process - which I have no idea how you'd even do that.\nHow come all of your packages say \"inactive\"?\n. Flow reporting should be pretty instant. There was a bug in Atom 1.9.0-1.9.7, that was fixed in Atom 1.9.8, where features that wait on specific grammars (flow waits for language-babel or language-javascript), weren't getting activated until you opened a new of that type. So if you opened Atom, and the js file you were working on was already open, flow would never see it until you opened a new js file.\nI noticed that you're using 1.9.9 now, but maybe you were using an Atom with the bug then? Is your 2 hour wait consistently reproducible?\n. @kennetpostigo so to be clear, if you quit Atom, and open it again, flow doesn't work until after a few hours?\n. I can't imagine a problem with Nuclide or Atom that would cause that issue :/\n. Strange. Glad it's working though.\n. We're aware of the issue and working on a fix.\n. We're working on publishing a fix. In the mean time, you can run this in the console then reload Atom to get things to work:\njs\nlocalStorage.removeItem(\n  atom.packages.getLoadedPackage('nuclide').getCanDeferMainModuleRequireStorageKey()\n)\n. Just published nuclide@v0.167.1. If you update to it, and reload Atom, everything should be working again.\n. Sorry, we're aware of the issue and working on a fix. Tracking this in #698.\n.

If so, we purposefully do not install them by default - if you'd like have them installed, enable \"Install Recommended Packages on Startup\" from Nuclide's settings.\n. @rageandqq works for me - still nothing?\n. @facebook-github-bot shipit\n. Thank you @rageandqq!\n. @shushz This is a bug in nuclideUri.join because path.join('/', '..') === '/.\n. @mostafaeweda I know, nuclideUri.join removes the protocol part and is supposed to run a vanilla path.join on the rest, so the expected behavior should be nuclideUri.join('atom:///', '..') === 'atom:///')\n. I looked at nuclideUri and it's assuming that the scheme is always nuclide:// - seems odd.\n. \ud83d\udc4d nice! but can you run the pngs through https://imageoptim.com please?\n. @JoelMarcey yeah, but we should be doing the ones we're adding - don't want to bloat the repo\n. \ud83d\udc4d I tested re-running platform-android-simulator-output.png through ImageOptim, and didn't compress any further.

I just did some testing. Atom, Sublime, Finder and ls, all sort like how Nuclide is sorting. However, VSCode is sorting how you're suggesting. tbh, I'm a little surprised by VSCode's sorting, I don't expect it at all. Is this something from the Windows world? cc: @shushz\n. @modocache - I don't know anything about this. It's your call. If you import it, I'll stamp it.\n. No idea - I've only seen this in Atom 1.12.0. @admmasters can you repro consistently in 1.11.2?\n. Turns out it is https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=5322. We're working with the Atom team to figure out what to do, since other's are likely to hit this issue in Atom 1.12.0\n. Here's the issue tracking this in Atom https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13073\n. I can't repro in Atom 1.11.2\n. Nope, that's correct. We updated to flow 0.34.0 and that's the syntax for variance. You probably have an outdated node_modules so babel didn't strip out the +.\n. @bitranch, from the Atom console (in the devtools), does process.env.SHELL match the shell you have configured to setup the right PATH? If not, then that's your issue. Atom shells out to your default shell, reads the environment, and patches itself. So if for example, you use zsh and your PATH is set in a .zshrc, but the OS thinks your default is bash - then Atom won't start the right shell, and you won't have the right PATH.\n. This is what Atom does to patch the environment https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/update-process-env.js. I tried /bin/tcsh -ilc command env - which is what Atom does - and that doesn't work. Seems like they don't support, tcsh. I recommend that you file an issue in the Atom repo. \n. url-regex looks like it matches more things that may not be urls. I don't feel strongly either way since nuclide-url-hyperclick has a really low hyperclick priority. We can either add this lib in the correct way (no ^ and proper shrinkwraps), or strip quotes in nuclide-url-hyperclick.\n. Found a very annoying bug in the regex while testing this. It captures the closing parens in [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason/). So you end up going to https://facebook.github.io/reason/) - which, of course, doesn't work.\n@Pangoraw how about just stripping the quotes off a match?\n. Worked.. Thanks!. Sorry we use this internally :(. @JoelMarcey lgtm. I re-verified the release by doing a clean install, and I can't repro. I see the module on disk and in the release https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/v0.196.0/pkg/nuclide-analytics. It could be that you have a partial install, can you try re-installing Nuclide?. Yup, thanks! See ea2580d2e8cbe1918f154af6980b55e09b379449. It'll be out in next week's release..

The version we currently support is here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/package.json#L114\n. This reference to the version number can be removed. When you look for \"nuclide\", Nuclide is the first result. And the rest are unambiguously not Nuclide.\n. That's fine by me. Less places to have to keep updating :P\n. Everything looks great, except this caret... but I can fix this on import.. ",
    "LegNeato": "I don't think so, looks like only the old version is available :disappointed:.\nTo check your setup you should be able to do the buck quickstart (for iOS, Android, or both) and it will create a working app that builds with Buck. Opening that directory with Nuclide should show the build toolbar and building from within Nuclide should work. Note that the quickstart isn't a RN app though.\n. I know the React Native support was being rewritten a bit ago to be more robust (for example, integrating better with the RN packager), which is why Facebook hasn't been pushing Nuclide + Buck as the default/best way to build React Native apps yet.\n. It is my understanding that in the near future Buck+Nuclide will be the preferred (but not the only) way to build RN apps[1]. For now I would follow the generic RN directions, which means you'll have to juggle Xcode, Chrome, and an editor like Nuclide unfortunately (that is, no Buck integration).\nNuclide does provide a lot of value in this situation over a stock Atom or a Sublime or Xcode-only, as it has all the Flow/JS goodies (click to symbol, autocomplete, etc) and talks to clang to get the same goodies for ObjC.\nThe main thing it doesn't have is rebuilding native code automatically in Nuclide (as that requires Buck), which is why you'd need Xcode to press the build button or use xcodebuild from the CLI. When editing just JS, the default RN packager should see when you save JS code in Nuclide and reload the JS bundle in the app, so the JS \"build\" works today. Removing the need to run builds via Xcode or the packager via the CLI is the work that has been happening to make everything plug and play (for example, see https://github.com/facebook/buck/commit/60ccc96ee20640ba2c32cb16b22e8da694a6379f).\nNuclide even has a native debugger UI so that isn't needed in Xcode (ObjC) or Chrome (JS), though I am not sure it is turned on yet for everyone.\n@mkonicek and @jamesgpearce may have more info or suggestions!\n[1] Note: I left Facebook earlier this year so I don't know what is going on internally these days.\n. Looks like @davidaurelio and @natthu did most of the RN Buck stuff and may be able to add more color too.\n. I think this is still an issue even though they appear to have \"fixed\" it on their side? Using latest of everything I can only see eslint errors when disabling legacy linters in nuclide-diagnostics and enabling linter.\n. I put up https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/213 that fixes the issue for me.\n. Without this Nuclide throws an error that it can't read row on range.start and I don't get eslint messages from linter-eslint in Nuclide's UI.\nWith this:\n\n. I wanted to fix it the correct way but don't have time today. Also, curious on your thoughts on the \"*\" dep being better for this case. (don't know why PR comments seem to have disappeared?

FWIW Nuclide actually started this way and there were a bunch of downsides...\n. I actually went to write a test runner yesterday and couldn't get it to work using the provided instructions...the new test runner was never registered with nuclide test runner no matter what I did. Does this work / is the README up to date?\n. @modocache for your swift stuff did you use Nuclide's test runner or roll your own?\n. Good to know, thanks!\n. CPU profile:\nhttp://filebin.ca/2zazuINSzlzj/CPU-20161024T100903.cpuprofile\n. Ah, I was running some generation scripts and have 10956 uncommitted files in the repo. So this is likely not a regression. The uncommitted files are all under one directory that isn't displayed or expanded in the file tree so I would expect Nuclide to still be able to handle it.\n@shushz Turning off \"Show uncommitted changes\"  does indeed fix the slowdown.\n. I'm seeing the same. Will try to debug when I get a chance.\nEdit: I believe uninstalling language-rust fixed it for me.. ",

I believe I found the issue. Gimme a few minutes.\n. Yeah, turned out that git wasn't in my path. That error wasn't apparent till I tried runningnpm install` in the nuclide-node-transpiler folder, as I assumed NPM was downloading archives, not using git. I also recently switched to SourceTree for git projects, which has a self contained git, and the old system git was removed.\nSorry about that.\nPerhaps if there's a way to grab the error message from npm install, might be useful in the future, instead of simply saying that the call failed.\n. SourceTree uses its own Git, so cloning that is no issue. Once I started using the command line outside of SourceTree (Windows cmd prompt), Git was no longer available.\n. Nice find.\nIs there a way for Nuclide to include that dependency manually and avoid Git while having the package that requires it use the local one? Not sure how much customization NPM allows unlike Composer.\n. @hansonw I don't seem to have any logs in /tmp or /private/tmp that match nuclide or atom. Is there another location that they would be? (Haven't found anything in settings).. @hansonw \nCool, here you are.\n2017-04-18 13:30:21.835 INFO (pid:1335) nuclide - Checking the Flow persistent connection gk...\n2017-04-18 13:30:21.853 INFO (pid:1335) Flow -

Hi @sronsiek, the gutter highlighting is actually provided by Atom's 'git-diff' package (https://github.com/atom/git-diff), which expects certain methods in the relevant \"Repository\" class to be synchronous. In Nuclide's implementation of HgRepositoryClient (the analogous class to Atom's GitRepository), we do our data fetching asynchronously and triggered by certain events, so the gutter highlighting may not work as expected.\nMore detail here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/master/pkg/nuclide/hg-repository#api-caveats \n1. Do you see highlighting after you 'save' changes?\n2. Also, do you have watchman installed on your machine? https://facebook.github.io/watchman/\n. via @ssorallen: This seems reasonable but changes the behavior of this except; it will no longer catch KeyboardInterrupts nor SystemExits.\n. ah, got it. @aledista we will merge this!\n.

This might be fixed with the upcoming release by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/13305bd2222e13c479091eb2fcd3b012cfddda35\n. Can't reproduce it. Is it a local or remote development? What kind of repository? Are you using atom-material theme?\n. Can't reproduce it.\nWhat is the remote machine OS?\nDoes it happen with every remote folder you're trying to mount? Are there any sym/hard links?\n. @tominkozhimala the error message mentions different client and the server versions. Could you please update the server 0.116 and see whether the problem persists?\n. Right. I'm able to reproduce the error when the authentication is not made fast enough. Fast enough is in about under 10 sec.\n. Yes, the server does start, I guess it's something in the client. Looking into this and will update.\n. Current status:\nThis error is consistently reproduced when something like a firewall is preventing the connectivity to the Nuclide server. I no longer can reproduce it in other cases.

OK. So, it seems you need to open the port 9090 in your inbound configuration. Otherwise, the SSH passes through and the server is started, but it can't be connected to later on.\n. Awesome :-)\n. @furdei - this seems to be a different issue. This time the stack trace suggests failing to parse some of the paths after a VCS status update.\n. Could you please verify that the server has started successfully and that the port is not being blocked by a firewall or something similar?\nThe different version message in this case is misleading - the actual reason here is ECONNREFUSED xx.xxx.243.140:9090.\n. @maksimsco what happens if you run: \ncurl -X POST http://:9090/heartbeat\n.

It seems like a different issue.  I can't reproduce the ECONNRESET. Is there anything else in the logs on either side?\n. @gwing33 Notice the different error code in the logs you provided. It's ECONNREFUSED, which means the server doesn't run at the time the connection attempt was made. It's different from the issue @corbt is having, where the server did run and Nuclide connected to it successfully, but then one of the sides (probably the server) has closed the connection.\n@bcarroll22 The different versions message is misleading. It's shown when there's a connectivity problem between Nuclide and the server. The detail of the message show what kind of a problem really occurred.\nBTW, the logs are at /tmp/nuclide--logs directory on both the server and the client.\n. @corbt Yes, please do - it seems like a different issue.\nAlso, could please you attach all of the server logs. Those you attached are only from the server startup process. For some reason there seems to be a level of inconsistency about log placing. Please run this command on the server to find all of the log files:\nbash\nps aux | grep nuclide-main | grep -v grep | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f2 | xargs lsof -p | grep logs\n. OK. Seems I'm able to reproduce it on the 119, but not on the master\n. I just learned that the fix I thought was in 119 in fact wasn't there. All of the issues in this thread were, in all likelihood, introduced by a change in v0.117.0 and were already fixed by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/3d49ff69c57bdd370fdfaa31001383d77c28d28a\nwhich will be part of the v0.120.0 release.\nSorry for the misunderstanding.\n. @bcarroll22 Damn!

What does the detail section, the one below the \"Server version is different than client version\" say?\n. Sure - np \ud83d\ude03 \n. What version of Node are you running on the aws instance? It seems to lack the support for generators.\n. Node 0.10.42 is not supported (and is ancient!). Why do you think n stable installed 0.10.42? I'd expect it to install current stable - v5.8.0\n. @levinqdl Could you please paste the your Working Sets configuration (the \"workingSets\" array from you Atom --> Open Your Config) and tell which project roots you have mounted?\n. @levinqdl The WS configuration seems fine. Is the issue still reproducible? Also, what project roots do you have mounted in your Nuclide?\n. OK. @JoelMarcey reproduced it. The issue is triggered by having the Atom's \"About\" pane open. Apparently, in some cases at least, having it open adds a virtual directory with unexpected path and that confuses the Working Sets. The next version - v0.128.0 will have a fix for that.\nFixed by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/2f49bff36f9fa41c7072d2479bc8ad68c1d1a35b\n. FWIW, recently a move by drag&drop was implemented in Nuclide's file-tree.\n. Yep, by John (presumably @drmathochist).. The code in this stack trace has changed a lot in the upcoming version v0.129.0\nLet's see whether this issue will still be reproducible in it\n. @Pszek thanks for reporting! It's a bug introduced in a recent refactoring.\n. I don't think its a good thing to change the Cmd-n behavior. You can always do it in your keymaps file if you find it more convenient, but I think that turning it on by default with Nuclide might lead to an unnecessary confusion.\nNotice that core atom also doesn't do it.\n. The hideIgnoredNames setting controls whether to hide or not files that match the configured ignore pattern.\nWhat about the \"Exclude VCS Ignored Paths\" setting in core Atom's settings? Is it unchecked?\nAlso, the installed packages above lists Nuclide at version 0.127, not 0.135. Could you verify, please, that you're on a recent version?\n. @diego-vieira  I was talking about the setting called \"Exclude VCS Ignored Paths\" from Atom's Core Settings. If you uncheck it, the gitignorred files show up faded, just as in Atom's tree-view.\n\n. Nuclide has recently changed its module loading logic to make it load faster. Unfortunately it doesn't always play nicely with Atom's cache. Could you please reload Atom and see whether this persists?\n. @rrawla  Do you still see the issue after a reload?\n. Closing...\n. Nuclide has recently changed its module loading logic to make it load faster. Unfortunately it doesn't always play nicely with Atom's cache. Could you please reload Atom and see whether this persists?\n. @juanmirocks  I think you confirmed in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/500 that after a restart it works for you. Closing the issue.\n. Yep, doesn't work. Thanks for reporting!\n. After a rather lengthy investigation it seems that it'll be too hard to support a secure connection to an IPv6 address (rather then a hostname), but the connection with an -k or a --insecure flag do work.\nI don't think we can justify further investment in this use case at this time, so I'm closing this.\n. I assume that the rationale is this functionality being not mature enough yet to recommend its wide usage.\n/cc @kyldvs\n. Duplicate of  https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/501 and https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/500\n. What does the details section, the one below \"Server version is different than client version\" say?\nSometimes this error is caused by network issues and the details section should contain the original error code.\n. Confirmed as a network issue here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/374#issuecomment-220489843\n. @steblar I can't repro that. Is there anything in the server or client log files? They are in the <system-temp>/nuclide-<username>-logs/\n@hansonw do you have any ideas? Any information that could help with that?\n. @yinghuitan, it seems to be related to debugger - could you take a look?\n. You probably mean the Current Working Root and not Working Sets, as Working Sets is an entirely different feature used to filter out parts of the file-tree.\nYes, unfortunately this functionality is not connected to the React Native logic, at least not yet.\n. It seems that the exception is thrown from a class that no longer exists in Nuclide as of version v0.137\nI suspect it might be an issue caused by Atom cache. Could you, please, try restarting Atom and see whether the problem is still reproducible?\n. We're working on a Java support, but at the moment it is far from being production-ready and heavily targets internal use cases. Once it's mature enough to be usable (and useful) for the general public we'll release it, but it's not in the near future.. This seems to be related to Atom's module cache. Restarting Atom should solve that.\n. I'm not sure what could cause this and I can't reproduce the issue. The configuration in the screenshot is correct - it does contain a proper object and not it's .toString() as the error you see suggests.\nMaybe there's some configuration listener in one of the other places (packages?) that causes this.\n. Oh, that's interesting. Thanks for mentioning @Emmanuel-PLF! Hopefully this may be a way to repro this elusive bug.. Unfortunately I'm still unable to repro the issue. Apparently something, for some reason, is trying to write a .toString() of a Working Set object instead of the object itself. I never managed to see it on my machine.\nIf you can repro it consistently, perhaps you can set a breakpoint in Atom's code that does this line: (Opt-Cmd-i to open dev tools) and then in the \"Sources\" tab open search (Cmd-O) for config.js and set the breakpoint on the line with the \"Validation failed\" that says that a value \"must be an object\". And once it hits collect the stack trace (with local values, if possible).\n\n. Hmm, don't think so. IIRC it wasn't out yet in 0.144. But, the paths change didn't fix it either. Will look into this.\n. Not sure how it ever worked. There are just too many things in this logic that are not Windows compatible due to various reasons. Most are silly, but some are rather major, such as reliance of that logic on Watchman.\nFor the time being I'm choosing to hope that https://github.com/hansonw/fuzzy-native will be compiled for Windows, removing the need to have this logic at all.\n. Please try restarting Atom, it seems like a source caching issue.\n. @facebook-github-bot shipit\n. Seems more like a problem with an external tool rather than Nuclide itself.\nBut still /CC @matthewwithanm\n. Yeah, sorry - I completely lost track of this. I suspect that this is no longer an issue as this package has been updated quite a lot since. Please reopen if you see it persists.. Also, it seems like a code caching problem. Please restart Atom and see whether the issue persists.\n. Cool, glad it worked for you :-)\n. Yes, I can repro that. Thanks for reporting!\n. Fixed by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/d353e32a3cd9c5d5a79c6bfa8e7ba1a239c55599\n. /CC @nmote\n. @facebook-github-bot shipit\n. @facebook-github-bot shipit\n. Not on the dev server, just run it from the nuclide directory.\n\n. Could it be that you forgot to pass the -g param to the npm install -g nuclide command on the remote host?\nYou can also try giving the full absolute path to the pkg/nuclide-server/nuclide-start-server under the nuclide directory in the connection dialog.\n. Nuclide relies on Watchman for the file system related notifications. If watchman is configured that it can't watch a certain directory, Nuclide will display the message above.\nPlease try mounting a non-root directory and also double check your watchman configuration.\n. Did it help?\n. I think this design decision was done in the spirit of 80/20. Persisting a list of files is much simpler than layout and, unless you use split panes, the result is nearly indistinguishable.\nMostafa, the developer of it, would know more, but he's on PTO for the next month and I don't want to tag him :-)\n. Yes, Nuclide does not have a complete parity with Atom in its file-tree functionality. And in an IDE I feel such a feature is somewhat less necessary than in a text editor.\nBut we accept pull requests.\n. Yeah, the thing is - the remote connection might not be established yet at the moment the deserialization is performed. So once it is, there supposed to be a logic that goes over the editors and swaps the buffer and the file instances.\nMy guess, would be that this logic does not detect the paths properly because they were in the mean time somehow deformed. I'll try to look at that today.\n. You can configure one for yourself in Menu --> Atom --> Keymap. Something like:\n'atom-workspace':\n  'ctrl-shift-d': 'nuclide-distraction-free-mode:toggle'\n. Oh. Yeah, using path module on Windows for remote paths was causing a lot of problems inside Nuclide, until we switched to nuclideUri.\nI don't think we can handle the event ourselves, but we already do intercept and mess with it a bit in some cases, albeit for different reasons.\nI guess we could extend the scope of this messing to address this problem too. From what I see in Atom's code, if the element's data-path will be relative for the duration of this call the path using logic will be avoided.\nBut it's messy. On the other hand, I'm not sure what other options are there.\n. If you're planning on doing remote development from Windows (to a Linux or MacOS machine) that should mostly work.\nIn local development on Windows, unfortunately, much of the functionality will not.\n. Does your project path contain symlinks? If yes, could you try mounting on a path without?\nThere's a KP that this functionality doesn't work on project paths with symlinks in them (maybe added via atom -a <path>.)\n. Reveal still works for everything that doesn't have a symlink in its path. So if you can just mount the project root by its resolved path most of the files, I guess, should be revealable.\nYes, it still won't work for the files under the symlinks in node_modules and .meteor, but it's a start.\nUnfortunately, at the moment at least, Atom does not provide a way to resolve the symlink path for a TextEditor, but hopefully it'll be added (see https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9879). Once it's in we'll be able to use that API to implement the reveal functionality properly for files under symlinks as well.\n. Could you try the following when such a file is opened in the editor?\n- Open the dev tools console (Cmd-Opt-i)\n- Type atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor().getPath()\n- Then, in the file-tree, locate the file that should have been revealed and using the dev tools' console inspect its element (Cmd-Shift-C and click on the file in the file-tree)\n- Look for the data-path property  in the element. Is it identical to what the ...getPath() command printed in the console?\nFrom what I've seen the failure to \"reveal\" is related to these two being different (somewhat simplified. Just editing the data-path wouldn't make it work. It's the internal data structures that use the same key that ends up being in the data-path)\n. Thanks, @maxbrunsfeld. OK. I'm closing this one.. Substitution of nuclideUri.join(workingDirectoryPath, '..') with nuclideUri.dirname(workingDirectoryPath) should do it, I think.\n. So, in case anyone cares, on Windows too dir, Eclipse, IntelliJ, Visual Studio, Explorer and Free Commander use same sorting as Nuclide. I did find one program that uses the other sorting - Far Manager.\n. Yeah, from what I've been told Hack is not a regular language, and regex-based syntax highlighting will never be completely correct. There are plans to move it to a dynamic grammar, but it's not something to expect soon as there are significant gaps to bridge.\n. Could you please provide a stack trace of the exception?\n. The above stack trace happens when a file's connection status icon (monitor shaped) is clicked in the status bar. For some reason it is marked internally as a (disconnected) remote file rather than local, which results in this error being thrown. Thanks for reporting! We'll fix that.\nThis stack trace, however, doesn't seem to be caused by opening of the file, only to clicking on the mentioned status icon, so there may be more. If you could provide a trace that happens when you open the file that would be great too!\n. OK. Thanks for confirming, guys!\n. Regarding the two attempts - I see that first issue of the command switches the mode of the task runner to swift and second toggles it. Probably, when initially opened it is opened in one of the other modes. The command to toggle the toolbar, whatever mode it is currently in is: nuclide-task-runner:toggle-toolbar-visibility.\nAs for the shown by default - it was a deliberate change: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/v0.174.0/CHANGELOG.md#highlights\nPerhaps @matthewwithanm can elaborate on that.\n. Unfortunately, so far Nuclide doesn't have a notion of a per-project configuration. It is on a to-do list, but no concrete plans yet.\n. Seems similar to #780. Just as there, the missing super class is React.PureComponent. It seems as if an old version of React was loaded.\nIf the issue persists after Atom restart, deleting the~/.atom/compile_cacheseems like the next logical step to try.\n. @jgebhardt, do you have any idea why wouldn'tReact.PureComponent` be available?\nAlso, @snavien, could you please open Developer Tools in Atom (Cmd-Alt-i), in the console type (separately):\natom.__DO_NOT_ACCESS_React_Singleton.React.version\natom.__DO_NOT_ACCESS_React_Singleton.React.PureComponent\nAnd tell what the result is?\n. The slow part seems to be rendering the Uncommitted changes section. Specifically the ChangedFilesList. @jgebhardt, could you take a look?\nIn the mean time, @LegNeato, could you please try disabling the \"Show uncommitted changes\" setting in Nuclide settings and see whether it helps?\n. That's a very weird thing. We use this functionality daily and I've never seen any problems with it.\nOne thing I notice in your screenshot is that the \"tool-bar\" package appears not to be installed. This is not a problem by itself, but it it might indicate an incomplete install.\nCould you try restarting Atom and see whether the problem persists?\n. @leeahoward Could it be that all of your project files are .gitignored? You can try unchecking the \"Exclude VCS Iignored Paths\" in Atom's core settings and see whether it helps.. Yeah, I wanted to add some dynamic nature to WS definitions. Unfortunately I never got to doing that. Also, it's somewhat tricky to do properly and a lot needs to be considered like:\n  - How does one name this WS, we don't have a notion of a currently active task.\n  - Several or none WS can be active at any point of time, which one is to be updated?\n  - What if there are multiple windows open.\n    - They can have some shared projects mounted in them, or not, or one can be a descendant of some mounted in the other. WS are stored in the global configuration, having one window update others may lead to unintuitive UI (which, unfortunately, is already happening in some cases with WS).\n  - One natural way of assigning a WS to an activity would be by associating with the source control state (branch, bookmark), but these things are optional, somewhat expensive to recompute, to track and also come with their share of problems.\n    - What happens when a user updates to a different changeset in the repository?\n    - What if the revision is rebased on top of something else.\nAgain, though, that is not to say that a dynamically declaring WS is not something that needs to be done, just that given the amount of corner cases to consider it is not something trivial.. In the Nuclide package settings (not Nuclide's custom, but that in Atom's settings for Nuclide package), towards the end, you have the option to disable the \"nuclide-file-tree-feature\". Unchecking it should prevent it from messing with the built-in tree view.. Sorry, I don't see myself getting to support that. This plugin modifies the DOM directly in the file-tree display:noneing its elements. Since Nuclide's file-tree is windowed this just would not work not to mention mess the internal positioning logic.. Yeah, sorry  - too many things to look at at once. Looking into it now.. @Alhadis so from browsing the source it seems that file-icons uses synchronous fs as part of its icon determination flow. With Nuclide this would be a non-starter, as one of the main focus areas for Nuclide is support for remote editing (on a remote host, that is). So all of our fs interactions are written with remote in mind.\nNuclide is also expected to work with trees of huge repositories, thousands of elements. For that purpose the rendering of the file-tree rendering is windowed. I suspect that adding any degree of complex logic to the rendering process would degrade performance significantly. Current approach in the file-tree is that everything that can be decided ahead of the rendering is, all data is kept in an immutable hierarchical data structure and the rendering is straightforward process from that structure.. I can't repro - just installed the latest version of flow-bin and Nuclide on my Windows laptop and Nuclide locates flow without a problem.\nCan you run commands like flow version from your terminal?\nAlso, you can configure an explicit path to the flow binary in Nuclide settings.. Does configuring the explicit path to the flow binary help?. You can type where flow in the terminal to see what your PATH resolves it to.. There's maybe more to it than I thought - I can't repro the problem on my Win laptop I usually use, but it does repro on another Windows machine.\nFlow is reportedly not found even though it's properly configured and is on PATH.. I can't repro that \ud83d\ude26 \n@wynsmart, could you please attach the logs? They are under /nuclide--logs. You can print the system temp folder with node -p \"os.tmpdir()\" if you have node installed or by opening devtools in Atom (Cmd-Opt-i) and issuing a require('os').tmpdir() command in the console.. Oh, maybe it's related to a fix in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/985. It seems to have been fixed in a PR merged this week: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/968\nLet's see whether it repros in next week's release (v0.201.0). Cool. Thanks for the confirmation. \ud83d\ude03 . CC @johnislarry - according to the stack trace it's the debugger.. File-tree has an automatic file search - if you focus the file tree and start typing it'll start matching only files with names containing the typed string. You can also backspace to delete characters from that filter. Having backspace suddenly delete a file would probably not be a good experience.\nThe file can be deleted by hitting the \"delete\" key. You can also change the keybinding of the nuclide-file-tree:remove command to something else, if \"delete\" is not convenient.. Thanks! Will fix.. No problem \ud83d\ude03  Yeah, it can be tricky sometimes.. Yeah, the file-tree has recently moved into a pane and we inherited these context items from it. It should be fixed (removed) in the next release.. Not a Hack expert, but LGTM. :-) I'll land that.. It's a duplicate of https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/951\nNuclide uses its own implementation of the tree view (file-tree in Nuclide) and it does not consume the atom.file-icons service. It should not be too hard a change, but it's also a low priority one.\nI'll review a PR on this if somebody's feeling like contributing it.. Yes, sorry about that. The atom-material-ui changes a lot of things.\nWhile we strive to make a reasonable effort for Nuclide to be compatible with themes, due to the resources constraints, we only officially support One Dark, One Light, Atom Dark and Atom Light themes.. Thanks for the report - we'll hotfix this.. This is fixed in v0.220.0. What theme are you using? Could you please try with, say \"One Dark\"?\nNuclide officially supports \"One Dark\", \"One Light\", \"Atom Dark\" and \"Atom Light\".\nIn reality it should work OK with many others, but we can't commit to it.. Could you please attach an apm list output and perhaps a screen video demonstrating the behavior?\nIf it's not a theme, then maybe there's some other package that interferes with the DOM. Nuclide's file-tree items were changed lately to enable support for the file-icons package. But without being able to repro this, guessing is more or less like shooting in the dark.\nBTW, if you have the file-icons installed, please make sure it's updated to the latest version.. Thanks for providing the additional details. I've reproed it.\nThe packages you have in common are:\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 busy-signal@1.4.1\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 intentions@1.1.2\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 linter@2.1.4\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 linter-ui-default@1.2.3\nI tried installing this, along with linter-eslint and after I caused an error the behavior would reproduce.\nThe linter inserts a linter-decoration element that spans the entire height of the file tree and intercepts the on mouse down events. So even though you're clicking outside of the visual underline, it grabs the mouse event, which causes the file-tree think that the underlined element was clicked and not whatever the mouse was pointing at.\nSee:\n\nI propose reporting this issue on the linter-ui-default repo. @jgebhardt could you chime in? UI is not really my domain.. That's not very informative.. I think you might be getting this syntax highlighting from the language-javascript-jsx package, rather than from the default language-javascript\n\n. I think these are various manifestations of Nuclide not yet being fully compatible with Atom 1.17.\nThe file-tree should be draggable to any place in the workspace, also I think there are some fixes to such problems in the upcoming release (probably today or tomorrow).. So much has changed/was fixed in these months. I doubt it's still an issue.. Yes, it's a regression. It's fixed already by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/53a3fb815a5abcad964e3bc049e058e12c433085\nand will be available in the next week's release.\nThanks for reporting!. BTW. A single click on a directory will select that directory, but a single click on the arrow left of it will collapse it.. Could you please list the installed packages? The output of apm list. The apm is Atom's package management command that should have been installed automatically when you've installed Atom.\nAnd if possible, attach Nuclide client log file - it should be at \\nuclide-%USER%-logs\\nuclide.log. But hyperclick providers are not limited to just opening URLs. In fact, the most used scenario is navigating the source code.. Sorry, I'm not convinced. Not every clickable link in the UI comes from the hyperclick package, so this still won't be a great place for such setting. What if you have a link in the diagnostics panel, or console, or terminal. So, if anything such setting should be Atom-global.\nAnd for the providers that don't handle URIs this would make a poor API.. Nuclide actually does run clang-format for C++ grammar files provided it's on its path.\nWhat was the active grammar on your file? The one shown in the right part of the bottom status bar.. This is actually thrown by the xterm module that we use.\nPerhaps it's better to be open on their GitHub page: https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js. Could you please share the repro steps? It's not very clear from the stack trace what actually led to exception and I couldn't repro.. Sadly, I don't think it's Atom 1.19 to blame. This was the issue with scroll bars for quite some time. In my experience it shows when you're moving from just using a laptop screen to an external monitor and reload (Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-L) usually fixes this.\nAnyway, it's not Nuclide specific, more likely Atom-wide.. @hansonw has fixed this in 0a860a29acfa7ee4294907b92c658aa88b3be92e! The fix should be available in the next release.. Sigh. We have very ugly and hacky code internally that injects info from the Outline View into Atom's Symbols view, but since it's so hacky and ugly it was never released publicly.\nThe problem was that the symbols view does not expose a service API to do it properly and I just didn't have the time to do it right. \ud83d\ude22 . Nuclide ships with its own implementation of the tree, so it disables the built-in one.\nYou can always enable it again by going to Atom settings, looking for \"tree-view\" package and clicking \"Enable\".\nIf Nuclide's file-tree, however, didn't show up it probably means that for some reason the installation did not go successfully and parts of Nuclide's code are missing (although it's worth trying restart Atom first to really make sure this is not some transient artifact).\nCould you please try reinstalling Nuclide?. Could you please attach the following pieces of information?\n The logs. They should be at $TMPDIR/nuclide-<username>-logs/nuclide.log\n Output of apm list\n* ~/.atom/config.cson\nSanitize the sensitive parts as you feel needed.. The file-tree's backing data structure is pretty complex and large (Nuclide is built and targeted to support huge repositories of tenths and hundreds of thousands of files).\nI'm reluctant adding more properties to it if it will not be used in a significant percentage of cases.\nI don't think softlinks within a repo is a case common enough to justify the extra cost.\nSorry.. Actually, I've already investigated this on Friday to some extent. I have a workaround landing in the next hour or so. The issue will be auto-closed when it does.\nThen, on next release (not sure whether it'll make the cut, so it may only be next week) we'll be able to see whether that helped sufficiently.. Unfortunately it turned out to be more complex \ud83d\ude1e  and the workaround was reverted because of it side-effects. We're exploring the alternatives.... Unfortunately we don't use Linux machines on our team. I suspect that this may be somewhat similar to the issue fixed in 147837fd00c3d55021a66cd05c8e70385a5f30be for Windows, but without a linux box it's hard to test.\nIt may just an issue of turning the custom remeasuring logic at https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/modules/nuclide-commons-ui/observable-dom.js#L272  for linux as well. Or it maybe something more complex, i.e. a Chrome bug.\nIf you feel like poking at it I can review a PR.. At this moment I suspect an interop problem with one of the other packages. Mainly because you'd expect this error to be consistent, yet I can't repo it (on Atom 1.23-beta1). ",

Haven't reported that yet. I'll try to separate the issues and report any other tomorrow.\n. @johnislarry I disabled all packages but nuclide and it's still happening. Are you sure you used the current atom-beta?\n\n\n. NODE_ENV is not defined in my shell. Atom sets it to production on first start. So here's the culprit:\nA new feature in Atom 1.8.0 is that atom overwrites the env vars when you start it from the shell with the ones that are present in the shell. What happens:\n1. You start atom and it sets sensible defaults\n2. You open another file from the shell and it overwrites those sensible defaults with whatever is set in your shell.\nThat's not a problem usually. Most of the time you actually want things like PATH to update.\nIn my opinion react should run in production mode unless NODE_ENV=development and not run in development mode unless NODE_ENV=production. It just seems too common that NODE_ENV is not set in an interactive shell. On the other hand: Why should react care about this specific use case? Most of the time it runs in a web browser where no one is overwriting process.env (which is probably set by webpack oder browserify).\nJust for clarification, there seems to be a bug within react that produces theses errors, but fixing this is not fixing the underlying issue. Using atom from the command line while Atom is already open throws react in development mode (unless you export NODE_ENV=production), thus slowing down Atom as a whole.

Lastly, has anyone started on a pr?\n. @lukeed - I know what you're getting at, forking Atom would mean that those interested in the nuclide behemoth of a package can focus purely on redesigning and redeveloping its infrastructure to perfectly suit nuclides needs. Personally however, I believe nuclide could benefit from the wider Atom community if it stayed as purely an abstraction package for Atom. Additionally, Atom could benefit from nuclide as the nuclide community helps Atom become more suitable and stable for larger package suites.\nMaybe something that should be looked into is the fact that actually the nuclide package in whole is a bit too much and seems to target a very specific use case/user story. In my opinion, I would love to see the 'nuclide installer' as the root Atom package, from there it is an abstracted settings and package management panel purely for the nuclide packages. You could reply \"Well... you can just directly download the packages you want and only them\" but this is a problem of accessibility and usability and I believe that could be of benefit. This is just my opinion, of course there is potential for this to be a very stupid opinion.\n. ",

I installed git using the Github for Windows installer -- not sure what the problem could be since all repos I clone use the https:// url from the browser...\nSo I uninstalled Atom and Github for Windows just in case and deleted the respective folders from AppData.\nReinstalled both but had the exact same problem in regards to the https helper error. I then dug through the atom folders and found C:\\Users\\<username>\\.atom\\.apm\\_git-remotes\\https-github-com-kevinsawicki-jasmine-node-git-38e2b399.\nSo I cloned \"https://github.com/kevinsawicki/jasmine-node\" using the Github GUI Client and copied the downloaded files into the folder above.\nReloading atom then churned the CPU for over 20 minutes (on a quad-core 3.4GHz i5, really?) and with no further manual steps the nuclide packages show up in atoms settings page.\nBut still no jsx support? Is that a unix only feature??\n. That thread was mentioning building atom from source. I just installed it via the clickonce installer. I did try cloning and building from source, with administrative privileges, but that just lead to issues from node-gyp which is notoriously dodgy on windows.\nAny commands I typed into powershell (regarding nuclide) never really failed, anyway. Errors only showed when starting atom. But on my reinstall, after manually cloning jasmine-node, there are no errors. Atom starts. Nuclide packages all seem installed. Just no JSX highlighting, no alt+click to jump to definition, etc...\n. I feel I should mention that I have iojs installed and whenever an application wants to use node, it uses the node.exe from iojs which is just an exact copy of iojs.exe\nBut the process transpiling for ages when I started atom after installing nuclide was an actual node.exe found at C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\app-0.211.0\\resources\\app\\apm\\bin and is v0.10.35\n. @bolinfest definitely had git in my PATH. I had a feeling apm wasn't -- well it was, but might have been truncated out as there seems to be an arbitrary 1024 character limit that applies only in \u2019some' programs. So I cleaned out the junk from my PATH variable but still no dice.\n@ALF-er Run As Administrator made no noticeable difference.\nIn the meanwhile, I've just been using atom and other apm packages such as react and atom-ternjs -- only issue is ternjs doesn't really support es6 -- which I make heavy use of. Not quite sure it's living up to Sublime Text (Sublime's naive 'any word' intellisense is better than no intellisense)\nTbh, I don't even know what I was expecting from nuclide -- I was intrigued by anything that could ease my react webapp development. Right now, I guess I'm just waiting for TypeScript 1.6 so I can go back to a reliable IDE but still use generators and other ES6 goodness!\n. ",

    "nmn": "I was having similar problems till recently. Nuclide-flow wouldn't work at all for me. It would just make atom-helper run at 100% Cpu.\nToday I updated to the latest version of both flow and nuclide-flow and I at least got autocomplete to work for a while. \nStill didn't see any errors highlighted though.\nInfo: I'm using OS X, 10.10.4\nLatest release of Atom.\nI have Autocomplete-plus installed.\nI have linter installed. (linter-plus no longer exists)\nI am on a macbook air early 2014.\nAdditional info, flow from the command line gave me some trouble as well today. I will do more tests and report back.\n. @nmote flow works fine from the command line. There was one version that locked up, but that only happened once and I've not been able to reproduce any more problems.\nNuclide-flow however, still doesn't do any linting at all. Autocomplete works fine now, and Atom doesn't seem to be wasting CPU cycles when I turn on Nuclide-flow\nFor what it's worth, I built my own linter plugin which works just fine. There are some JSON parsing problems which is a trivial fix away, but it works well enough most of the time.\nThere is also another atom plug-in called ide-flow that works decently well. It has auto-complete which is on par with Nuclide, linting support and types on hover. However, it only lints on save, and my plug-in lints as you type, which is why I wan't happy with ide-flow. Further, ide-flow isn't integrated with linter and it's linting styles can only be editing with CSS directly.\n. @nmote I have some updates:\n- The high cpu usage is most likely an issue with Atom and not Nuclide-Flow, as I've had the problem from time to time, even after disabling nuclide-flow. It seems to be connected to the Settings screen. Earlier, this problem seemed to be happening when Nuclide-flow was enabled, and so the co-incidences fooled me.\n- Linting: After the very latest update, linting works. It feels like Lint on Fly doesn't work. As I type, the errors that show up reflect the state of the last save, and not what is on-screen. To make matters worse, linter doesn't update anything on save.\n  For example, let's say there is a flow error when I save a file. After that as I type, the error will stay even if I fix the error. The error will stay when I save the fix. But will then disappear when I type something.\n- Autocomplete: This feature has been hit or miss from the very beginning, but this is probably an issue with flow or autocomplete plus. I get good autocomplete for complex types like promises, but not for simple types like numbers and strings. This is true for ide-flow as well. There is an option in the Api for autocomplete plus that lets you hide lower priority options. So it's possible some other package is hiding the suggestions from Nuclide-flow\n- Type Hints on hover have never worked for with Nuclide.\n- Go-to-Symbol definition, sometimes works, but only with my own custom keyboard shortcut. Atom doesn't seem to like overriding cmd+click.\n. Quick update: While working on my own linter plug-in, (which works almost flawlessly now!) I've added support for traces. Best example of Traces is with the render method annotated with ReactElement.\nWhen you return null from such a method, flow, correctly, complains. But it also points to the type definition of ReactElement as a trace. The actual error message is broken up between the main error and the trace.\nNuclide-flow currently just concats the error string together, but otherwise ignore the trace. Since it would only require changes to a single file, I'll make a patch to fix this in Nuclide.\n. @nmote I'll make pr for on the fly linting / trace support shortly. (My own linter has gotten very good, and I'll be sad to deprecate it :( )\nabout auto-complete, I want re-iterate that autocomplete works for me. I just don't get as many suggestions as I should. I tried over and over and for a function returning a promise, autocomplete ALWAYS works.\nSo the problem is either with flow itself, or that the suggestions being returned by Nuclide are low priority and being hidden by other suggestions from other sources. I will keep an eye out for more details.\ntypehint, just don't work though.\n. @nmote I just started coding and autocomplete working much better. One really annoying bug though: using the autocomplete eats up the prefix. In particular, I typed a dot and got a list of options. When I used one of the options, it removed the dot.\nIf you don't want on the fly linting, Ill give a pr in a couple of hours at most. I can pretty much copy-paste my code!\n. @nmote I can confirm, the autocomplete does give suggestions at a very low priority.\n. https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/139\npull request which adds support for traces in Nuclide Errors. Also it treats warning as warnings, instead of making everything an error. Code has been ported over from my own linter so it's well tested over the last few days.\n. @nmote Autocomplete priority is the only thing pending, yes.\nI still haven't got type-hints to work. The checkbox is checked. I tried to troubleshoot and and I reinstalled the type-hint package, but to no avail. Other people seem to have it working though, so I will keep troubleshooting when I have time. (it's the lowest priority feature for me). Once I have some positive results, I will report back here, perhaps with a documentation PR. (For example, it wasn't clear that nuclide-type-hint was a dependency in the documentation. Only Linter and Autocomplete-plus were explicitly mentioned.)\nNuclide-Click-to-Symbol is the other thing that doesn't work for me. I'm going to try to install the demo providers to test these packages, and then check back for flow.\n. @nmote I did use APM to install all packages of Nuclide while trying to make those things work. But it didn't seem to work. I'll try to install everything from source and report back.\n. @cbosuna Nope... just tried installing from source but no luck. I've tried two separate macs. any of the hover/click things in Flow don't work for me. (type definition tooltips and click to definition)\nThat said, Hyperclick with the demo package DOES work. Also, IDE-FLOW has type tool tips that also generally work.\n. @cbosuna GOOD NEWS, I built from source again, and now type hints and click to source are both working. Sadly, autocomplete seems to be broken now, which was working before I did this update.\nSo as of now, everything is working great (at least in flow) except autocomplete.\n. Please open up the command line and do\napm search nuclide\nYou will see a bunch of nuclide-packages. Install them with apm itself. Nuclide-installed and Atom's UI can take multiple days to do it all correctly.\nBe mindful that certain packages are definitely not supported on Windows \u2014 Nuclide-flow won't work since Flow isn't supported on Windows.\nI'm not sure about Hack and other packages. Without Flow however, you will get no autocomplete, typehints etc. So Nuclide is of little use on Windows. You may get Hack Remote development to work, perhaps.\n. Could either of you tell me if you did anything special when installing Nuclide to get tool-tips working? Any dependencies? I have not been able get tooltips working at all.\n. @phorust Flow works just fine for me. I get linting errors and autocomplete, but not typehints. Just wanted to make sure there wasn't a dependency I was missing.\n. There are packages in Nuclide that don't work on Windows. Flow for example only works on OS X and Linux systems. That may be causing some issues.\nFurther, did you install the packages using the atom UI or with apm ?\nUse APM to install all Nuclide-* packages before you open up atom and you should see better results. Atom itself has some serious issues when you open up the settings screen.\n. There is also the reactiflux slack team that may make sense.\n. @nmote I actually did a little code reformatting to match the style after running it. May have made a mistake. Let me see.\n. Should be fixed now. Sorry again.\n. Just pushed more changes. Here's some info that might help you avoid wasting time:\n1. I added an eslintrc file to help me catch styling problems, and added the missing semi-colons, removed trailing spaces, and add dangling commas\n1a. I made dangling commas mandatory, which meant I had to add a few dangling commas where they didn't exist before.\n2. I Used setup script and tested that the errors work correctly in Atom\n3. I Updated the tests to test the code correctly -\n3a. Errors are not always of the type 'Error', they are either 'error' or 'warning' which is taken directly from the flow diagnostic. I have tested that the lower-case strings work fine with AtomLinter\n3b. I changed the last test to check for the trace array being present on the object.\nOther stuff:\n1. I added a couple of flow type definitions in the file to be a stricter type check for diagnostic objects\n2. I would like to commit the .eslintrc file to help future contributors, let me know if that is OK.\nThis is the eslintrc file I'm using \u2014\njs\n{\n  \"parser\": \"babel-eslint\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"browser\": true,\n    \"node\": true,\n    \"es6\": true\n  },\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"quotes\": [2, \"single\"],\n    \"eol-last\": [0],\n    \"no-underscore-dangle\": [0],\n    \"no-cond-assign\": 0,\n    \"indent\": [2, 2],\n    \"camelcase\": 0,\n    \"new-cap\": 0,\n    \"strict\": 0,\n    \"no-unused-expressions\": 0,\n    \"semi-spacing\": 0,\n    \"dot-notation\": 0,\n    \"consistent-return\": 2,\n    \"default-case\": 2,\n    \"radix\": 2,\n    \"brace-style\": 2,\n    \"comma-dangle\": [2,\"always-multiline\"],\n    \"space-after-keywords\": [2, \"always\"]\n  },\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"TextEditor\": false // used for imported type definitions.\n  }\n}\n.

Hi @cbosuna i've restarted atom numerous times over the course of testing.\nI believe that this issue might be related to #132 since I am able to connect successfully via http but not https\nThe problem does not come from atom itself since the output of the error when trying to start the nuclide-server is Nuclide server failed to respond to version check on port 9090.\nIt is not urgent for me as it's okay for me to connect via http since I am working with a local vm but might be a problem to those who try using this tool as a means to connect to a remote server over the web.\n. I am also getting an error related to the nuclide-quick-open package\nSystem: OSX 10.10.4\nAtom: 1.0.3\nNuclide: 0.0.26\n\nI think the error message code might help in resolving the issue.\nIt just searches forever with no results.\nAlso this error may be cascading and causing the new issue I will file in a few minutes\n. You're right the untitled file was the one causing the message but is not the real problem. The problem is that it does not find any results to any search.\n\n. Yes I did at 100% @bolinfest but as you'll be able to see in the picture above the problem is occurring on local projects too. Let me know if you need me to do any testing.\n. I'm on OS X 10.10.4 @bolinfest it's @ChristianGrech who's on windows 8.1, I don't have watchman installed on my mac though... is it necessary for quick open to work?\n. Wow that is a huge chain of dependants, it definitely deserves to be mentioned in the docs hahahahha\nSo I tried installing watchman from brew and also nuclide-client using npm on my mac (client side) and still get no search results seems really odd. Still no search results both locally and remotely.\nI wonder if I am the only one experiencing this issue or if it happens to others as well.\n. @bolinfest I can't believe you were up for so long yesterday, you're a real champ!\nSo yes I did see some interesting things in the logs. \nSeems like an issue with watchman.\n```\n[2015-08-04 11:44:02.473] [ERROR] nuclide - Error while talking to watchman:  { [Error: Command failed: /bin/sh -c /usr/local/bin/watchman get-sockname\ndyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libpcre.1.dylib\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/watchman\n  Reason: image not found\n]\n  killed: false,\n  code: null,\n  signal: 'SIGTRAP',\n  cmd: '/bin/sh -c /usr/local/bin/watchman get-sockname' }\nError: Command failed: /bin/sh -c /usr/local/bin/watchman get-sockname\ndyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libpcre.1.dylib\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/watchman\n  Reason: image not found\nat ChildProcess.exithandler (child_process.js:729:12)\nat emitTwo (events.js:87:13)\nat ChildProcess.emit (events.js:169:7)\nat maybeClose (child_process.js:997:16)\nat Socket.<anonymous> (child_process.js:1166:11)\nat emitOne (events.js:77:13)\nat Socket.emit (events.js:166:7)\nat Pipe.close (net.js:464:12)\n\n``\n. So if you have read all the way down this issue and gotten to this post then congrats here is the magical touch that will make yournuclide-quick-open` work\nSorry windows guys @bolinfest says you have to wait for watchman for windows\nIf you're on a mac make sure you install the Latest version of watchman by essentially using the\nbrew install --HEAD watchman\nOtherwise you will not be able to use the nuclide-quick-open feature\nI will refer to this issue #87 since they are related in some way\nGood luck everyone and thanks @bolinfest for the great help!\n. The ownership of the file remains the same but permissions pass from 644 to 600\nAnd to answer the question the server is running on the same user as the file owner which are me and not root.\n. Thank you very much @bolinfest \nI'm running this on clean Debian 8 installation.\n. I am confirming that v0.0.26 fixes the issue.\nThank you for addressing to the issue so quickly @bolinfest \n.

But it seems the new ones aren't working, is there something we have to do to turn them on?  I can't find Shan Phylim (who made the commits) in github\u2026  Unless maybe it's @shanpls?. This doesn't seem to be fixed in 0.362.0, I still don't have git diff gutters.. @Boboss74 that's strange, it seems to be working for me in 0.366.0.  I restarted atom, and git-diff is still enabled (I've been manually enabling it each time I restart atom).. Perhaps this is related to https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/issues/144?  Is nuclide only using the first scope?  The scopes I'm getting on that file are:\nsource.flow\nsource.js. It seems that in atom 1.33.0-beta1, the source.js scope is no longer included at all in files using flow, which also happened to break all my snippets.  (https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18398). Yes, you can add source.flow to the list of scopes to lint in the linter-eslint settings.  In the next release of linter-eslint, it will be included by default.. This seems to be the commit which broke nuclide for non-facebook users:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/22eea032f97ba3f724a8f98b62431c6d398286df\n@velocityboy, do you think you could take a look at this issue to see if my guess is correct?.

    "Daniel15": "cc @kyldvs\n. Hey look, a \"Close Issue\" button. :tada:  :smile: \n. Basic functionality for remote projects appears to work on Windows. I'm using Windows 10 on the client side and Debian Linux on the server side. I can see the directory tree, edit remote files, and files are automatically reloaded if I edit them directly on the server. I haven't tested the more advanced IDE-like functionality such as Flow/Hack integration, but I imagine these would be fine as they execute on the remote server rather than the local machine.\nOn the other hand, adding local project folders is totally broken. Nothing happens after clicking Add Project Folder and selecting a folder. The console has no errors, either.\n@mostafaeweda It seems like it'd be useful to have separate Github issues to track each Windows issue individually, rather than just having this one master issue for Windows support.\n. Nuclide seems to run pretty well on Windows now. I've been using it for all\nmy day-to-day work at Facebook (I'm not on the Nuclide team, I'm just an\nend user of Nuclide). I haven't encountered any major issues and for the\nmost part it seems quite usable.\nAlmost all of my work is done on a remote Linux server though, so I haven't\nreally tested Nuclide with local projects. There may be issues with\nHack/Flow for local projects as opposed to remote projects. Remote projects\nrun typechecking/linting remotely so it's less likely to encounter issues\nwith it.\nSent from my phone.\nOn Jun 16, 2016 4:37 PM, \"Ryan Cole\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nPerhaps a run-down of what does not work on Windows, and why? Maybe\nthat'll assist us in knowing why this can't have proper Windows support.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/321#issuecomment-226644001,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AAFnHVRHTgz_cVldKK-JK7DLnlksxa5nks5qMd4fgaJpZM4HFVEP\n.\n. For what it's worth, this plugin is similar, but actually works with Nuclide: https://atom.io/packages/pane-move-plus\n. Good catch, thanks. :+1:\n. > Will path.isAbsolute() properly exclude remote paths?\n\n@bolinfest - It appears to:\n```\n\nvar path = require('path');\nundefined\npath.isAbsolute('c:\\src\\')\ntrue\npath.isAbsolute('c:\\src\\foo.txt')\ntrue\npath.isAbsolute('nuclide://foo')\nfalse\npath.isAbsolute('nuclide://foo/bar')\nfalse\n```\n. @ssorallen - Hmm, I think remote directories still worked, I'll have to double-check tonight though.\n\nI think the issue is that the Node.js path module has different behaviour based on the operating system it's running on. Consequently, this means the behaviour of isValidDirectory is dependent on OS, and the spec is not taking that into account. It's checking if \\a\\b\\c is a valid directory, which untrue on every OS. It should be checking /a/b/c on non-Windows systems, and c:\\a\\b\\c on Windows.\nI think the ideal fix is to have a test that properly handles multiple OSes:\nif (on Linux) {\n  runLinuxTests();\n} else (on Windows) {\n  runWindowsTests();\n} else (on Mac OS X) {\n  runMacOSXTests();\n}\nAnd then ensure the build runs on every operating system.\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a way to force Node.js to use the Win32 implementation of path.\n. path.js has this at the end:\n```\nposix.win32 = win32.win32 = win32;\nposix.posix = win32.posix = posix;\nif (process.platform === 'win32')\n  module.exports = win32;\nelse\n  module.exports = posix;\n```\nSo require('path') gets you the implementation for the current platform, and you can do require('path').win32 or require('path').posix to get a particular implementation.\nI wonder if there's a way to swap out the require('path') so it explicitly requires the win32 version for unit testing (that is, what would be returned by require('path').win32). This is where a proper dependency injection framework would come in handy.\nAny suggestions for what the test should do to handle this?\n. @ssorallen - Just tried one approach to fix the test, let me know what you think. Rather than just overriding path.sep like it did before, I override the entire path module. This means the Windows versions of path.isAbsolute and friends are used. If you squint, it almost looks like dependency injection. :stuck_out_tongue: \nFinished in 10.975 seconds\n69 tests, 135 assertions, 0 failures, 0 skipped\nAlso confirming that remote projects work. See screenshot below - \"nuclide\" is a local project while \"live\" is a remote one:\n\n. Potentially the same root cause as #480\n. This was properly fixed in aac4ce06b3eb5eb18ddc35cd9afe5103b6d749e5.\n. > Not sure how it ever worked.\nI swear it used to work when I was testing https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/435, but maybe I'm misremembering :stuck_out_tongue: \n\nsome are rather major, such as reliance of that logic on Watchman\n\nI don't think I had Watchman installed on my old MacBook Pro? Do we actually need Watchman for local projects?\n. > I also know @Daniel15 is a good resource for Windows (I believe he uses Nuclide on Windows sometimes).\nI use it every day! \ud83d\ude04 \nWorks wonderfully for remote projects - For my work on www at Facebook, everything works perfectly. I guess this is expected, as most of the magic happens server-side.\nIt's okay but not as solid for local projects - OmniSearch is broken for local projects for example (#554). Running Flow locally may work now as Flow has a Windows build, I haven't tested it though.\n. For what it's worth, older versions seem to be working fine for me. I downgraded by running:\napm install file-icons@1.7.25. Thanks, fixed.\n. ",
    "kyldvs": "This is resolved. https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/fdf65bc45d14ca75d84f03d26a4adc4ce6b4bc47\n. Hmm, you sure? It works for me. I know TaggedTemplateLiterals aren't functioning now but it should search through the expressions of a template literal like normal and find the myModule expression.\n. This can be closed\n. Cool I see the issue. http://astexplorer.net/#/D3YrchZQyq\nIn ${bar} bar is just an identifier, in general we don't classify a plain identifier on its own since it's almost always part of a larger expression, but in this case it's not. A fix will be to get all the identifiers from template expressions and include plain identifiers in the non-declaration-identifiers method.\n. Should literally be adding this here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/format-js-base/lib/utils/getNonDeclarationIdentifiers.js#L189\n// `${bar}`\n{\n  searchTerms: [jscs.TemplateLiteral],\n  getNodes: path => path.node.expressions,\n},\n. LGTM, someone else will need to merge it in\n. Ah yeah. Handling comments is really hard. Right now if the comment is meant for the file I require there to be a new line separating it and the require. If it's directly above the require I assume it's attached to the require. For example there is no way to make these cases unambiguous:\njs\n// Have to require these monkey patches for some reason.\nrequire('monkey-patches');\nrequire('a');\njs\n// Copyright blah blah 2015\nrequire('monkey-patches');\nrequire('a');\nIn these two cases we want them to behave separately:\njs\nrequire('a');\n// Have to require these monkey patches for some reason.\nrequire('monkey-patches');\njs\n// Copyright blah blah 2015\nrequire('a');\nrequire('monkey-patches');\nFor now I expect this cases to be differentiated with a new line to get correct behavior:\njs\n// Have to require these monkey patches for some reason.\nrequire('monkey-patches');\nrequire('a');\n``` js\n// Copyright blah blah 2015\nrequire('monkey-patches');\nrequire('a');\n```\n. Yeah it's possible to distinguish between Line and Block comments, or even test the value of the comment, but I don't really think it will solve the problem well enough. In my first example I think it would be reasonable if all of those were also block comments which would still cause things to be ambiguous.\nIn general I don't feel great about fixing an issue in a way that would allow another perfectly valid issue to be created that's basically the opposite of this one. If someone created an issue along the lines of \"Comment on the first require doesn't follow the require when formatting\" it would be perfectly valid after your proposed fix, and it wouldn't be fixable without breaking this again.\nI like forcing the new line in between header comments and requires because it's unambiguous. And in general people naturally separate the header comment from the first line of code anyway.\n. Is this with the, \"Reprint: Format all code\" option selected? This is a highly experimental feature, I haven't had a chance to work on it in a while, we should probably update the description of this option to communicate that it's experimental and shouldn't necessarily be used yet.\nThis is the line that error comes from: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/reprint-js/lib/reprint.js#L534\nWe could try to pop up a notice when this happens though so it's more clear what's going on. For that we should probably do the same with any error from format-js, not just with reprint-js.\n. Yeah, it is not configurable at all yet. The pretty printer is a very experimental feature.\nFirst I'm focused on having it break things according to a single style guide before allowing custom styles to be substituted in for different AST nodes.\n. Yeah this would be a good feature to add behind an option. I maintain this plugin as a side-project, so PRs welcome :)\n. Yeah I'm hesitant to add this functionality because it's definitely not mature enough. I still expect that there will be issues every so often and the user should manually review which requires get added. Making it run on every save seems dangerous to me.\n(also on a more practical note it's not integrated with grammars, it can be run on any file type, it just happens to throw a parse error on non-js files. That functionality would need to be built so that it only runs-on-save for JS files too)\nThere is save-after-run functionality built into it though, which is kind of similar.\n. I guess this is fine now to not require in www, right @DmitrySoshnikov ?\n. I think this one will conflict with Image.react which we do want to require. Can we remove this?\n. What is Option?\n. ",

It's now should be fixed by http://nuclide.io/blog/2016/01/13/Nuclide-v0.111.0-The-Unified-Package/\n. Discussion about the problem of implementing custom git repo is here https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10423\nI have a working git implementation in my fork of nuclide, but to work correctly it requires Atom patching because of that problem (repo detection firing up too early). Or solution 2 - make GitRepository pluggable :(\n. It works on a newer version of Atom + Nuclide (although, not for remote projects). It works for git and mercurial repositories (currently use Nuclide on Atom stable + latest Nuclide). .git should be in the root of the project.\nAlternatively, you can disable Nuclide file manager and enable default one.. @eyko, even after reloading Atom after first run with Nuclide?\n. Oups, I'll put it in a separate branch and will reopen pull request\n. ^ Wanna add I'm interested in feedback, will add remote projects support for it a bit later\n. Correct. I'm voting for complete git support from nuclide side.\nThanks for feedback, will update package :)\n. I'm not sure if decorations for search results output are great, any advices? No clue on how internal BigGrep works or decorated, that part is very secret or could be shared partially? :(\n. Hi! Thanks for the feedback, will do. Same for async support for git-utils! We want git remote projects internally in company too\n. Yes, we already discussed that with him. I'll work on a patch for nuclide on top of async branch this week.\n. :+1: I already have some stuff working, still a lot of stuff to fix\nAlso another 2 cents: we need to have repository links pattern config option, what do you think? (people using gitweb, github, gitlab etc and I'm not sure that everybody's able to create their own ./fb/config)\n. :+1: would be nice\n. Another question, this one is related to nuclide-server - it looks like in both implementations we should compile binaries - for git-utils (libgit2) or nodegit, in Atom's case we can use bundled libraries (and actually npm install will cause binary libs to fail otherwise), but for nuclide-server should we include those libraries installation or maybe we can go with git shell commands execution for the first iteration? That could be easier and I'll finish those today then. Otherwise, I'll need suggestions on libgit2/nodegit + nuclide-server if shell exec is not good for initial iteration :)\n. I see, but we need to make it working on server side also.\nThe problem with Atom's Git now is that the default git module is overriding custom one because of race condition (you'll always get default provider on editor's load and your custom git provider 2+ project opening). I'll try to look into it in the nearest weeks to finally make git usage possible in Nuclide.\n. Hi, any other suggestions? Having this flag makes tests working without pkg/fb/ directory\n. Or maybe even suggest to assign Cmd+T's file search on Cmd+P to replace Atom's file search to Nuclide's omni search:\n'.platform-darwin atom-workspace':\n  'cmd-p': 'nuclide-fuzzy-filename-provider:toggle-provider'\nAnd also add information about watchman there\n. Is it correct then? (default Cmd+P) It pops up with empty keymap.cson\n\nOr omnisearch one is correct?\n. OS? Screenshot? Nothing is happening when you're pressing buttons?\n. Something's wrong for sure on Windows with file-tree:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cAgOptd.png (context menu is still working, but for example if you'll add file in folder - it won't update right away = slightly unresponsive)\nAlso notice about ctags:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Eb2sqUE.png\nAlso\nC:\\Users\\viatsko\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\app-1.5.0-beta0\\resources\\app.asar\\src\\package.js:713 Failed to require the main module of 'nuclide' because it requires an incompatible native module.\nRun `apm rebuild` in the package directory to resolve.\nAlso thrift compilation problem here in the log file:\nhttp://paste.fedoraproject.org/310789/45278783/\nConsole log is clean...\n.

I was using taglist before (similar to the one with vim) and what is available now in nuclide is way better. I would say this is THE best  feature for me as changing syntax of javascript ( ES6 , ES6, flow,..) makes the file longer and harder to navigate. outline really help. I could live without the above requested feature, as you typically uses only with one test, which typically you are currently working on. Typically people may remove only after they done with it.

I can't speak for Facebook (without first talking to Facebook lawyers) but I am definitely open to contributing this work over to you fine folks.\nIn general, we don't have a great answer yet to the question of how libraries should distribute their type definitions. We do currently have the ability to pull in type definitions from node modules\u2014either via .js.flow files or through [includes] which fbjs does.\nHowever, we run into issues with both of those schemes. The underlying issue is that type definitions don't always work with newer versions of Flow, or even projects on the same version that have differing configurations. The end result is that a library consumer gets Flow errors from the library code instead of their own code, which really should never happen.\nWe're circling a solution to this in flow-typed, which is nearly ready for everyday use. My instinct is to hold off on this until that picture becomes a bit clearer.\nI should note that whatever the solution is w.r.t. pulling in 3rd party type definitions, I am still open to moving ownership of the code to RxJS. I'll make a note to follow up here in the coming weeks. Until then, let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.\n. ",

    "inkytonik": "I am seeing a similar problem when using Atom 1.3.0-beta0 on Mac OS X 10.11.1 with nuclide-hg-repository 0.0.35. No other nuclide packages are installed.\nWhen I have a hg project open, add some lines to a file and save it, the standard (non-nuclide) tree view updates to highlight the file and its directory (and parents). Also, the small box with a dot in it appears at the right end of the status bar. I don't get any gutter lines nor any indication of \"added or deleted\" line counts in the status bar. All of this works fine with a git project.\nI don't get any crash report nor can I see any messages that come from the nuclide-hg-repository package in the console, so I'm at a loss as to how to investigate this further. Suggestions would be welcome.\n. I did some more investigation and I found a fix for this problem that works for me when using the latest single package install of nuclide (version 0.115.1). It's an easy fix. See this pull request for more details: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/355.\n. After a brief investigation, it seems that this issue is the same one that is affecting the atom-svn package: atom-svn/issues/20.\n. Great, thanks.\n. Thanks. I'll report back here if there are any issues.\n. I've installed Nuclide 0.128.0 which contains this fix. The hg repo support seems to be working fine in that I get the expected status bar information and gutter annotations.\nHowever, Atom's CPU usage seems be quite a bit higher now when I have the hg repository support enabled. When using the Nuclide hg repository support Atom sits at 25-30% CPU constantly which on my Macbook Pro means the fans are on most of the time. This CPU usage happens even when Atom is running but I am using another application, or when I am using Atom but just navigating around and not making changes to files.\nWhen the hg repo feature is turned off Atom idles at a much lower and \"normal\" CPU usage.\nIs it possible that this async support is doing a lot more work than it needs to?\n.

Disabled 70% of the nuclide-* packages while at it and that dramatically increased the performance, things are smooth all the sudden. Those should not install by default, imho.\n. Hey guys, I have an open issue about this #344 - I eventually managed to get this working by manually cloning the repo and installing the server and client separately. In other words, follow this https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/master/pkg/nuclide/server to install the server and for the client, git clone into .atom/packages, cd into nuclide and npm install. It is not a a node.js issue.\n. Ok after few hours cracking my head with this, I managed to get this working by git cloning the repo on both the server and my machine and installing both manually. The issue remains with the current version so I'm keeping this issue open.\n. ",

FWIW i just found this package. https://github.com/nmn/linter-flow-plus\n. Just to clarify, the reason this is useful is that when developing with live reload / hot reload enabled, saving file would trigger the app to reload and state to be lost. So saving a file just to check flow / lint errors (other than the extra keystroke) is not ideal because it causes interruption in development context and might require one to navigate in the UI back to the original state again. \n. Why is lint-on-the-fly only for legacy linters? What's the diff between legacy linter and linter anyways?\nRegarding performance, recently I started using https://atom.io/packages/linter-flow with atom's linter package to get on-the-fly linting support and it seems to work pretty well performance wise. \n. Fantastic, thanks for the explanation @nmote . So to confirm, is there a workaround I can use to get check without save working today with flow + nuclide diagnostics?\n. got it. On an unrelated note, @nmote is there a way to validate all files have // @flow enabled if you want to be extra strict with types? Perhaps via eslint?\n. ",

By a process of elimination I figured out its the term3 package - not quite sure why but disabling it fixes this issue.\n. I finally got things working by modifying the code to use 'exec bash -c' rather then 'shell'. I don't understand why this changes things\n. In case it matters, the ssh server is dropbear not openssh.\n. I have made this work by ssh port forwarding.\nSomething like:\nssh $J -L T:22 -L T:9090 -L T:9091 -L T:9092 T:9093\nthen have nuclide connect to the 127.0.0.\nAlthough as this isn't supported and is kinda hairy it can take a bit of messing around to make it work.\n. I am having the same symptoms. Manually starting the server starts a running process, I can telnet to 9090 and curl -X POST http://server:9090/heartbeat gives curl: (52) Empty reply from server.\nHowever, when I try and launch through Atom, on the server I briefly see the node process launch, it creates logs in /tmp/ etc. but then quickly disappears. The nuclide logs on the server don't report any error.\nAtom 1.5.3 and Nuclide 0.117.0.\n. Two additional data points.\nDowngrading client and server to 0.116.0, and everything seems to work fine again. I was wondering if it might be to do with the change from using an interactive shell to exec (https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/cbc5c62dfe66e73932d195edc886cb6718adefe1/pkg/nuclide/remote-connection/lib/SshHandshake.js)\nIn doing so, I also found a workaround (although I don't quite understand how this works).\nOn my laptop I run\nTERM=nuclide ssh $SERVER nuclide-start-server --common-name=$SERVER --workspace=$HOME --json-output-file=/tmp/nuclide-sshhandshake-me -t 60\nand then when I connect through Atom to the same server it seems to attach to the existing server process (and the two server log files show the same certificate being used).\n. Thanks!\n. This seems resolved for me in version 0.120.0\n. version 0.123.0 also seems to be unreleased?\n. This seems to be fixed now.\n. This relates to my request for a nuclide api.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/516 where you've provided an interim solution.\n. Can't any atom package already access the ssh connection during the initial connection and execute commands?\nAnyway, at this stage most of the packages I've messed with are doing everything on the client other than executing a command (e.g. a linter) so they haven't required installing a package on the server, but I suppose that's not a particularly onerous requirement if it fits the security model better, it would be nice to have an example of a remote package that simply executes and command and returns the respond.\n. @capouch in general any package that is specially made to do so (which is not terribly easy right now) and isn't one of the built-in nuclide packages isn't going to work with remote projects.\n. Ok. It does seem to fire now. I swear that this used to fire without that but ok, problem solved. Thanks.\n. This is very related to https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/282\n. I've put them (lightly redacted) here. I have the one from 0.168.0 when it works and 0.172.0 when it fails.\nhttps://gist.github.com/jjh42/e4fe5c5441903b9da136a8138a475529\n. I just setup on a new server running update Debian linux and I ran into the same issue which was also resolved by @fanch317 's change (thanks). Comparing with my previous server, I believe the formating of openssl has changed slightly inserting an extra space hence the new for the change in the regular expression.\nIt would be great to get this accepted into the mainline.. It may be this crash occurs when I have  poor network connectivity / like the dropped connection results in an incomplete message or something? I'm not sure.. thanks. is there an easy way to disable the python debugger so that port\nnever gets opened/ to eliminate that possibility.\njj\nOn Thu, May 31, 2018 at 8:37 PM Mostafa Eweda notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nPlease update to the latest nuclide and re-open with reproduce steps as\nthis stack trace doesn't yield code on the line.\nI'm also wondering if you have something that sends text/non-json to\nlocalhost:9615 as that port is taken by nuclide to enable python\nauto-attach debugging:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/modules/atom-ide-debugger-python/RemoteDebuggerCommandService.js#L39\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/1517#issuecomment-393653217,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAWpXvzD8m5BdIk_xHpdFf6wTzELZ6C5ks5t4EaTgaJpZM4T0_KO\n.\n. \n",

I can't repro, but I think I know what might be causing it\u2026fix coming!\n. Hi @collegeimprovements! Sorry, but that's not a feature that's currently on our roadmap. Depending on the details of your situation, you might be able to get something working with SSH tunnels but right now the only supported usage is connecting directly to a machine running the nuclide server. (Of course, you could always mount the remote drive and edit it that way.)\n. Sorry, this is an issue on case-sensitive filesystems. A fix is coming!\ncc @ssorallen\n. @googlaev We fixed the issue this afternoon. Please update to 0.115.1!\n. Sorry about this. It was reported in #349, fixed in 062aa89 (which @zertosh just pushed as 0.115.1).\n. Hi @Nikamura! Two quick questions. Have you used the debugger successfully with a previous version of RN? Also, what version of node do you have installed?\n. Ah, I think I see. Sometimes the debugger gets stuck for some reason. Can you hit the Pause button (F8) and see if it resumes?\n. Okay, those are RN issues \ud83d\ude22\nI have commits in to fix it (facebook/react-native@bb3d8d535000ad78a95776f2de9282130f80d0bd and facebook/react-native@ecf6981093f7f9afe4a462eee9e7af864c6d9e70) that I'm hoping to get into 0.21.\n. You too! Thanks for helping me diagnose!\n. The paused thing is a bug \ud83d\ude22. I'll try to figure it out ASAP.\n. Sorry, I've been working on an overhaul of the debugger stuff that's taken longer than anticipated. I'll put in a quick fix for this today.\n. Hey all! I've pushed a bunch of updates. Here's the current story (as of bb3311c75092ad7d80a456b3be0b734c55398f72):\n1. You don't have to unpause between reloads (yay!)\n2. The debugger isn't paused when you attach it if you're running node 4 (yay!)\n3. \u2026but it is if you're running v5 (boo!)\nI've opened a new issue (#402) for the remaining bug. Thanks for bearing with me!\n. Hey @micksabox! Nuclide actually uses your system node for this task (e.g. whichever is on $PATH). Sorry, I'll add a setting so that you can customize this. \ud83d\ude15\nIn the meantime, can you try opening Atom from the CLI in a terminal that has the right version of node on the PATH as a workaround?\n. Oops! The packager doesn't actually call out to node; it just calls the packager.sh in react-native which in turn uses the node on your path.\nThe workaround should still do the trick, but this illustrates a need for a better $PATH story in Nuclide.\n. To clarify what's going on here: Nuclide is executing the packager script in react-native which does the following:\nTHIS_DIR=$(dirname \"$0\")\nnode \"$THIS_DIR/../local-cli/cli.js\" start \"$@\"\nSo whichever node is in your $PATH is the one that's going to be used. Note, though, that Nuclide isn't going to get $PATH modifications made in your shell configurations (.bash_profile, .zshrc, etc) unless you launch it from a session that has those modifications.\nThere are a couple of things we could do to make this better: 1) give users more control over their $PATH within Nuclide and 2) allow alternate ways to specify the packager command. (We already have one alternative, which is a .buckconfig with a [react-native] section.)\n. @Emilios1995 @micksabox With 2d735053a7140b5ee0026a18ca532d0e91f1f576, Nuclide will use the nuclide-react-native.pathToNode setting to run the packager. (\"Path to Node Executable\" under \"Nuclide-react-native\" in the Nuclide settings.) This'll be in next week's release.\nAlso related, once atom/atom#4126 lands, Atom should automatically pick up your PATH settings!\n. Hm, this is currently the expected behavior. (If you want another directory open, you can add both to the project.)\nI'm honestly not sure about recursively searching the tree for packager information. Not only is it potentially costly, it also means we'd have to account for the possibility of finding multiple RN projects. I think a better idea might be to specify the packager command in a config file in your top directory. As the error message alludes, this can already be done with a .buckconfig file that looks like this:\n[react-native]\n    server = path/to/node_modules/react-native/packager/packager.sh\nIn the future, I think we'll probably be adding other ways to configure this command (e.g. a package.json script or some kind of Nuclide-specific config) but that's still a bit up-in-the-air \ud83d\ude25.\nEDIT: Sorry, packager.sh uses the cwd so you couldn't just call it directly like that. You'd need to create another script that uses the correct directory.\n. I just wanted to jump in and say that this would be so awesome @dpo! Keep us/me in the loop!\n. Alright, 152cbe00befb85671376ab4e683d92ba1f16978c should take care of this. It'll be in the next release \ud83c\udf89\n. Hi @tsvetann! Have you gone through the troubleshooting tips yet? If you're seeing \"Upgrade Required\" in a browser, it probably means there's another inspector connected. Do you have another Atom window open with one? Have you tried restarting Atom yet?\nYou can check to see what's using the port by running lsof -i :8097 in your terminal.\n. It's interesting that you're not seeing your React Native app in that list. It's running, right? What version of RN is it?\n. Sorry, @darrenkenny but we can't accept code unless you sign the CLA. \ud83d\ude22\n. Sorry about this @rawon. \ud83d\ude1e\nDid this just start with 0.127?\ncc @ssorallen @shushz\n. Hey @zyu! Could you please describe your issue for us?\n. Sorry, @zyu, I'm having trouble understanding your issue. Please bear with me!\nAre you saying that you're unable to install Nuclide? I see a very old version of node in the error you showed. Is your Atom up to date?\nCan you answer these questions for me?\n- What are you trying to do?\n- What were you doing when you got the error?\n- What was the expected result?\n- What actually happened?\n- What versions of the following are you using?\n  - Atom\n  - Nuclide\n  - Operating system (for example, \"Mac OSX 10.10.5\")\n. Sorry, @zyu, this looks like an apm issue, not Nuclide.\n. Hey @gonsfx! I think I have a repro here, but I'd like to confirm. I see the \"breakConfig\" error (but I don't think that's actually the issue). Instead, it looks like Nuclide gets stuck on the loader breakpoint. Clicking the pause button (actually clicking it, not pressing F8) will get Nuclide un-stuck, after which breakpoints seem to work normally. Does this match what you're seeing?\n. Hey @mschipperheyn! If you're seeing this in Chrome, it seems pretty unlikely that it's a Nuclide issue. The \"stopping at another\" position thing seems to suggest there might be a sourcemap generation issue, but I'm not really sure. If you create a reproducible test case, I can look into it though.\n. Thanks for the issue, @mikelambert! We're working on updating how the output is displayed so I'm not sure how much time we want to spend on updating the old version. Still, I can at least make this autoscroll when you're at the bottom in the meantime!\nThis is just an Atom Text editor, so Page Up/Down should work as normal. Did the pane have focus when you tried?\n. Hey @ganvinalix! The debugger and packager are supposed to used different ports; you don't want the debugger to use 8081. \nIn the current release, 8080 is hardcoded for the debugger. 08d9363c364f4ef4ab449dceb322651186c81962 (which'll be in next week's release) changes this to a less common port. In the meantime, you'll need 8080 open for the debugger. You can see what's currently using it by running lsof -i :8080.\n. Awesome. I'm gonna close this then \ud83d\ude0a\n. Hey all! Can you try running buck from the command line and let us know what the output is?\n. Thanks for the report, @tychota! This should be fixed by a4ff2e70b1eb2cb7414ebc60d04acc423cc49603, which'll be in next week's release.\n. Sure thing!\n@tagpro So are you saying that you were already successfully debugging, but then ran the \"React Native: Start Debugging\" command again and that's when you saw this?\n. I've seen this error pop up in the console before and pushed 029c0e561f8cfb086f002ed3fc76867fa38f49b7\u2014which should be in next week's release\u2014a few days ago to work around it. I'll try your repro steps and see if it still exists after that commit!\nI had the fix ready to go a couple weeks back but then had to take off for an emergency and it sat in limbo for while. Sorry about that \ud83d\ude22\n. Hey @zhiquan-yu! This was fixed in a53a8b6418cc7e4c21df2586da746498fe632e45. Thanks for the report!\n. Oh interesting. Do you have an invalid package.json?\n. @facebook-github-bot shipit\n. I feel like this should work (but it throws random errors):\njs\nconst serialized = atom.workspace.paneContainer.serialize();\n// later...\natom.workspace.paneContainer.deserialize(serialized, atom.deserializers);\nI wonder if the fact that it doesn't is an Atom bug or just not an intended usage.\n. Hey @stefanwuest! We have another thread going on about this (#667) so I'm going to close this one. If you could help us get a repro, that would be SUPER appreciated!\n. Thanks! Fix on the way (:\n. Hi @danfairs! A few questions:\n- Do you have multiple roots open in your file tree?\n- If so, which one is selected as the working root? (It will have a briefcase icon instead of a folder)\n- Where is your node_modules directory relative to your working root?\n- Where is the package.json relative to your working root?\n- Does your package.json include react-native as a dependency?\n- Is react-native installed in your node_modules directory?\nThanks!\n. Thanks all. I've found the issue and a fix is on the way! Sorry about this.\n\nAtom 1.8.0 (Nuclide is still not fully compatible to Atom 1.9, right?)\n\nYeah, that's right.\n. Okay, I just pushed v0.161.0 with the fix. Let me know if there are still issues and thanks for reporting!\n. \ud83d\ude1e Yeah, please open a new one.\n. Hey @kmiyashiro! This is an issue that was introduced by Atom 1.9 (we currently support 1.8).\nHaving said that, this should be fixed by 4e70e59930e1cdc7b75808f31a457076aec6642d and I'm putting together a release that includes that now.\n. Alright, v0.161.0 is out! Let me know if you still have issues (:\n. Thanks for the report @pleonex! @nmote does this help you diagnose #660?\n. Sorry we missed your previous report @lfaler! \ud83d\ude1e\nWe still haven't switched over to Atom 1.9 so it's possible that this is related to the Atom version, but I just tried to repro with both 1.9 and the 1.10 beta and couldn't.\nIs it possible one of your other packages is interfering here? Also, do you see the same thing with other versions of Atom?\n. None of us have been able to repro this so far\u2026do you have any errors in the devtools console when you see this?\n. @frostpuppet @stefanwuest Can you share which packages/versions you're using too? Even with two monitors, we haven't been able to repro.\n. Hey @michaelsteenkamp! What version of mercurial are you running?\n. Sorry everybody \ud83d\ude1e\nLooks like this is an issue with node 6. For now, you can just point Nuclide to 5.x by changing the \"Path to Node Executable\" setting under \"React Native\" in the Nuclide settings (nuclide-react-native.pathToNode).\n. We're actually going to be switching to using JSC instead of node soon. That way it'll be more like the actual environment.\n. Sorry for the delay, @dili91. Unfortunately, we don't currently have any resources about this, but the Buck team is looking into creating some. We're also hard at work on supporting non-Buck flows.\nSorry I don't have a better answer for this.\n. Thanks for the feedback @andresn! Even better stuff is on the way!\n@frantic Any ideas about improving this?\n. Seems like this is more of a React Native issue, so I'm going to close this one. Thanks for reporting @andresn!\n. Hey @tzt3315! That's really weird. Can you give a little more information about how we can repro this? Does it happen every time you start Atom? Thanks!\n. Yeah, we should have a way to do this from within Nuclide.\nIt's not quite as straightforward as adding a setting, because Nuclide allows multiple ways of specifying the packager command (since we use a .buckconfig file to do it internally\u2026so technically, you could hack Nuclide into using a different port today by adding a .buckconfig file to your project with the right incantation).\n@frantic Can you think of a good way to handle this, knowing that we don't have control over the command being run? Maybe an environment variable? Or rn-cli.config?\n. Thanks @Rovack!\n. Yeah, this is a result of how package serialization interacts with deactivation. I'll look into it.\n. Thanks for the report @ffxsam! This will be fixed once atom/atom#12759 lands so I'm going to close.\n. Hey @ffxsam! So here's how it works: the task runner is shown by default and it tries to pick the most relevant task for you.\nSince the Swift toolbar hasn't (yet) been updated to indicate that it's not relevant, that one winds up getting selected. If you hide it, that will be serialized with the project though.\nHaving to toggle it twice is definitely a bug. Does that repro consistently for you?\n. > Yep, every time.\nCan you file another issue for that? I can't repro so any debugging info you could provide would be \ud83d\udcaf.\n\nPS: I noticed for each folder Atom is run in, it remembers the open files, and if the Swift toolbar is open. Where is that information stored exactly?\n\nThat uses Atom's workspace serialization. It's stored in ~/Library/Application Support/Atom IIRC.\n. Sorry, it's stored in IndexedDB. You can clear it by running atom --clear-window-state or via the resources tab in the Developer Tools.\n. Thanks, all. We know about the issue and I'm working on the fix now.\n. Sorry I forgot to report back on this one! Hopefully you noticed that it's not automatically showing that toolbar anymore (:\nlmk if there are still remaining issues.. Hey @moogus! If you hide it, that'll be remembered for that project.\nI'll look into adding a setting that hides it by default though.\n. Gonna close this since it's a dupe of #768.\n. This sounds like a bug in facebook/react-devtools. @jaredly @gaearon Have you seen this before?\n. Hey @nanandn! Do you see the logs if you relax the \"tags to include\" setting under \"Nuclide-ios-simulator-logs\"?\n\n. The tags are our way of recognizing which items are coming from React Native, but it seems like they're not being applied in some cases (or maybe we're not parsing them correctly).\n@yungsters Anything spring to mind here?. @wellyshen @alexhhn Sorry, @yungsters is trying to help debug.. @yungsters We don't tag messages at all in open source? Having no filter (^.*$) isn't really a solution because the console gets spammed with irrelevant logs.. Ugh. Maybe we have to go back to tailing that one random file. I'd much prefer having React's messages tagged in some way that we could identify though. @frantic do you have any ideas here?. @wellyshen No updates currently, sorry! For now, you need to change the filter like you're already doing.. Hey all, we're aware of issues with debugging React Native. We're currently working on debugging using JSC (instead of Node) so we haven't prioritized fixing the node issues. We're hoping to roll that out within the next few releases (before the holidays). Sorry for the pain.\n@johnsonsu We actually are using the system node. You can change which node we use via the \"Path to Node\" setting in the Nuclide settings. You can try changing that to point to an older version.. Sorry! This was a regression in this week's release. I pushed the fix earlier this week (4e99fe4) and it'll be in next week's release.. Earlier this week = today, apparently \ud83d\ude1d. Hi @moogus! I don't think the file tree ever had a context menu item like you describe, did it? The items you're seeing are entirely new ones that come as a result of putting the file tree into a panel. This way, users can have more control over their workspace (for example, by dragging the source control tab below the the file tree).. Oh, I see. We have that under the \"Split\" submenu.\nYeah, this is confusing.. @shushz How do you think we should resolve this? My first inclination is that we should keep the separate \"Split\" items (mirroring the regular Atom menu). Then they would override the same-named items added for the atom-pane selector.\nIt's a little weird that the same label does different things, but Atom's the same way so\u2026. @moogus Thanks for the screenshot btw!. Should be fixed by 2e08e5327f3ed0e2cf49aa9de20bb45eca1f03e4. Thanks again @moogus!. Sorry for the slow response, but glad you figured it out! It should work fine as long as node's on your PATH (Atom tries to construct the correct PATH variable).. Thanks @lcbarco! Fix landing soon.. Hi @kracwarlock! Nuclide will search for .flake8 config files. We don't (currently) support setup.cfg or tox.ini, but we should. PRs welcome!\n1: https://flake8.readthedocs.io/en/2.0/config.html. @nmote Thoughts?. Thanks for the PR @fcFn! The updated expression is going to require the unknown: though, right? So it's not going to match \"React\". Maybe just change it to unknown:React|React?. derp, sorry. of course it will. thanks!. @fcFn Thanks so much for doing this! Is there any chance we could get a tiny test to make sure we don't regress?. @fcFn Thanks!!. Thanks @gaearon! A couple of things:\n\nDependencies need to go in the root package.json (not individual packages'). I was just going to fix this myself (and regenerate the shrinkwrap files) but\u2026\nThe react-devtools package is pulling in electron-prebuilt. That's a pretty huge (unnecessary) dependency, and it has a postinstall script, which we won't run. @zertosh suggests publishing a separate react-devtools-client package, that we and react-devtools can depend on.\n\nThoughts?. @zertosh @gaearon Thanks you two, this looks great!! \u2764\ufe0f. @mwalkerwells thanks for doing this! the \"diagnostics\" in the label is kinda redundant and \"traces\" should probably be \"descriptions\" since that's what they're called below.\nalso, how wide does the window have to be to accommodate this? we're getting a little tight with those two checkboxes. maybe we could shorten the other label too as an easy fix. (\"Show only diagnostics for current file\" is awkwardly worded anyway imo). @hansonw @zertosh Are we okay to bump 2.0 now?. Hey @a-koka! Sorry for the disruption \ud83d\ude14\nThis is actually expected behavior\u2026we should probably post on the (very neglected) blog about it. The first time you cmd + clicked, you should've seen this notification:\n\nIn short, Jump to Definition and Multiple Cursors both want to use it. In the past, we had some clever logic for determining which to do but, ultimately, the effect was just that it was never predictable. As of 0.207, cmd + click will always trigger Hyperclick. You can use cmd + option + click for multiple cursors or, if you really want to use cmd + click for it, change the Hyperclick trigger in the settings.. Sure! It's Under Nuclide's package settings:\nAtom > Preferences > Packages > Nuclide > Settings > Hyperclick\n\n. Sorry, @AlexDufresne, looks like this slipped through the cracks! Are you still having the issue? If so, can you give us repro steps? What language are you using?. Wow, sorry this slipped through the cracks @jazmon. Thanks!. Thanks @KatSick! 759bf2f859fd2148471a8735dd08b217bfd74611 should fix this (:. @steelbrain If you don't need to intercept any events, could you add pointer-events: none to the linter-decoration element? That seems to fix it.. Looking through the commits my guess would be that it's facebook/nuclide@147924b, which seems to have removed one of the nodes.\n@jgebhardt @shushz Any background on this change?\n1: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/compare/release-v0.218.0...release-v0.219.0. Hey @mikedotJS! Does this happen every time you reload Atom? If so, it sounds like you have a bad Nuclide install and reinstalling Nuclide should fix it.. Great! (:. Sorry, but no. Hopefully our continuing improvements to Nuclide will make you want to install it someday!. Thanks for the report @kungfu321! @a20012251 has fixed this so I'm going to close (:. If you drag the tab back into the left dock does it stay there?. @seekshiva awesome for! It looks like you're just splitting the center pane? Can you drag it further, into the left dock?. @crucialfelix Can you provide a repo? I can't repro this behavior.. @crucialfelix Thanks so much for the followup! This seems like something that'll have to be addressed in that package then, so I'm gonna close.\nThanks again!. Hey @ericschaal! Looks like this is an issue with meteor-helper. I've opend PEM--/meteor-helper#62 to try to get it fixed. In the meantime, you can work around it by disabling that package.. > Hence, for guys that haven't set NODE_ENV to production, they have a slow down usage.\nAtom automatically sets NODE_ENV to 'production' unless you launch it with --dev.. Great minds\u2026 \ud83d\ude0a\nThat would be awesome if you could make that change. Handling the mutation of process.env in Nuclide seems like an edge case that isn't worth the cost since it would make using dependencies that require React themselves a huge pain. Also, I'm sure that other packages using React (like [the new GitHub one][2]) are just requiring it without compiling it too.\n[2]: https://github.com/atom/github. Does this happen multiple times for the same project? We changed the serializer name and accidentally didn't also keep the old one (for the transition) \ud83d\ude1e so it should happen just once per project.. Aw sorry. We missed some locations \ud83d\ude22. @ffxsam Thanks for reporting btw!. This has been reported by other Windows users but we haven't had time to look at it yet. I'm going to try to download a VM and take a look.. @SimerdeepSinghPopli @arufian Also, do you see anything in the Dev Tools console? (View > Developer > Toggle Developer Tools). Hey @daveysigma! Any chance you can make a video showing this? I can't repro.. Hey @nahuelhds! Can you explain (3) a bit more? If you focus the file tree and use the arrow keys, it should change the selected file (at which point you can hit return to open the selected one). As far as I can tell, this is how Atom's tree-view behaves too.\nThe first two are features we don't support yet. I'm not sure if/when we will, but PRs are welcome!. @shushz Aren't we already putting the outline view items into the symbols view?. @idevelop Thanks for the report!\n@wbinnssmith I'm surprised that this can be null (there's a NullGrammar) but \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Hi @bibekg! Have you tried setting the nuclide.pathToFlow (\"Path to Flow Executable\") setting?. Yeah, that makes sense. I'll ask @nmote to look at it next week when he gets back \ud83d\ude0a. Hey @santhosh2sai! Is Learn IDE a fork of Atom? What version of Atom are you using? Seems like it's a pretty old one as atom.workspace.toggle() has been around since 1.17.. This has been hanging a while so I'm going to close it. lmk if this is still an issue \ud83d\ude0a. Ah yeah. The current sorting logic sorts by type then path then line number\u2014all either ascending or descending. Some options are:\n\nUpdate the \"type\" sorting to be type, path, then reverse line number. This means:\ntype \u25b2 = type ascending, path ascending, line number descending\ntype \u25bc = type descending, path descending, line number ascending\nMake it so that descending sorting isn't necessarily the reverse order of ascending. Then we could always sort the lines ascending when sorting by type:\ntype \u25b2 = type ascending, path ascending, line number ascending\ntype \u25bc = type descending, path descending, line number ascending\nAdd \"memory\" to the sorting (and more column parameters to the function) enabling you to sort by multiple columns as @ljw1004 suggests. Honestly, I'm not super thrilled with the idea because it means that the current sorting state wouldn't be indicated by the view (at least not just the arrow in the header). Also, it seems reasonable to me to expect that if you sort by type, then by line, then by type, you should be back to the original sorting whereas this wouldn't be the case.\n\nThoughts?\n1: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/9f3f927262e01e5397d5b5561a36c14dc5940de6/modules/atom-ide-ui/pkg/atom-ide-diagnostics-ui/lib/sortDiagnostics.js#L44-L49. @ljw1004 Do any of those indicate the current sorting state (e.g. with a \u25bc)? Maybe the right answer is to have that behavior and just remove the arrows from the header. That might better convey that you're performing a sorting operation and not changing the sorting state. \ud83e\udd14. @fredemmott so if a new diagnostic is appended to the end of the list, its order wouldn't be affected by its line number?. hi @fredemmott \ud83d\ude0a\nwe've already got an issue for this at facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/issues/101. better yet, i'm about to ship the fix! should be in next week's release.\nthanks for the issue \u2764\ufe0f. @kikoseijo that's a different issue! should be fixed with today's release though. if not, please open a new issue or find an existing one dedicated to it\u2014this one's for renaming the commands (:. sorry about this! fix on the way!. thanks for the report, @allenylzhou! @wanderley's out but i'll ask him to take a look at this next week.. thanks for the issue @k! are you looking for a mouseless keyboard shortcut or a different +click modifier?. cool (:\nwe do have a command for this, but it's kinda weirdly named: \"Hyperclick: Confirm Cursor\", and it has a default keybinding of \u2318\u2325\u23ce. is that not showing up for you?. @wbinnssmith maybe we should add some aliases for this one?. weird! i can't seem to repro this. do you have any errors in your devtools console? also, does this repro when nuclide is the only package enabled?. Thanks for the follow-up, @awilkins! Gonna close this since it seems to have been addressed there (:. Thanks for the report @ValliusDax!

We're going to close it out, but if you can repro with the latest versions of Atom and Nuclide (and other third party packages disabled), please let us know!. hm, does this also happen in a brand new project with no gitignore? also, do you have a global gitignore (excludesfile in your .gitconfig)?. sorry, i can't seem to get this to repro. if you can figure out a repro or could share your global gitignore, please feel free to reopen!. Thanks for the report! This should be fixed in the current release (:. Hey @alina-zubbb! Sorry for the delay, but this should be fixed \ud83d\ude42. Last week I made it so that the task runner package will call setProjectRoot() on task runners (if that method exists) so you don't really need to consume this service.\n. Do you think you could lazily create these when they're used instead? Since we're using inline imports, that would save us having to do the IO for loading the modules until/unless the user actually selected a Swift task.\n. How about using \"success\" and \"error\" levels for 0/non-zero exit codes?\n. Since the task meta doesn't actually change, you could just do:\njs\ncallback(SwiftPMTaskRunnerTaskMetadata);\nreturn new Disposable();\nnbd though.\n. Hm, I think I'm actually calling this several times. I guess I should change that!\n. nit: I don't think this will lint. (We avoid parens for single arg arrow functions.)\nAlso, what's the desired behavior for this when your current project isn't a swift one? Not sure what all this would affect, but it seems a little weird for the directory to \"stick\" to the last selected swift project.\n. ",

I forgot to demonstrate that click-and-mark doesn't work either, but that's straightforward to verify as well.\nNote: the video was shot against another plugin, autocomplete-python, but I later verified that the responsible plugin is this one.

",
    "chenglou": "Sorry, in case that wasn't clear: I do want the fuzzy matching. But ST and atom's default fuzzy marchers and providers still only match if the first letter is matched. The rest of the string is still fuzzy.\nOtherwise, as it is currently the Flow autocomplete destroys all my snippet shortcuts: if, fn, ret, etc. There are always strings in my open files whose middle section fuzzy matches these, so I have to tab around. \n. Sorry yeah, that was a bit of a generalization. It's my current context, though it turns out to be surprisingly big.\nDisplaying the results whose first letter match, first, would be a big improvement for me.\nAs an aside, I thought the fuzzy matching logic was provided by autocomplete+? Do you actually have a say in how results are ranked?\n. I see. What's the difference between alpha-style navigation and atom's built-in fuzzy/non-fuzzy file search?\n. I see, thanks!\n. yes, it's with that option selected.\n. I'm using the latest version of Nuclide and the problem still persists.\n. Might be in flow itself: https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/1282\n. Ah yes I did have it enabled. Didn't think it'd affect this. It works with that turned off. Thanks!\n. No I didn't\n. Btw, I tried implementing this using the existing nuclide code. I can't intercept the editor on onWillSave and paste in the newly formatted code; setting the buffer to the formatted code seems to happen after the save. I'm guessing it's because API for formatting returns a promise and I resolve that and do the formatting, but the save's already done? The format-js code doesn't use the nuclide formatting facility afaik, so didn't have this problem.\n. It'd be reaaaallly nice if one could recursively click inside the datatip to jump to another location\n. Oops sorry about that. Looks good!. This should be postponed until after we convert to the new function application syntax. Otherwise the regexes will have to change again after that conversion.. This API exists since the earliest documented version of Atom (1.3.2)\n. But that'd actually be less readable and wouldn't shortcut (it currently does), lol\n. Oh oops, misread what you wrote. Fixed!\n. ",
    "johnislarry": "Thanks, looks good, we'll merge this in.  Also \nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/f95c0ffdd0b565fdd89485ebc518a1d50cb9ac98\nfixes the original issue\n. We've talked about it and we'd like to leave discussion to GH issues for now.  If there's a lot of interest for a public nuclide slack channel in the community, then we will revisit the issue. \n. Did you follow these instructions?\nhttp://nuclide.io/docs/remote/\n. When you use the nuclide server we recommend installing the npm nuclide globally npm install -g nuclide on your server, and locally install the apm nuclide with apm install nuclide or install from within atom, to use the atom packages.  Feel free to re-open if there's still a problem\n. Hey, currently we only officially support Atom 1.1.0 with Nuclide, can you try on that version and see if it works?  That said, maybe the fix for this is simple.  Assigning to @ssorallen -- the file tree master\n. I'm not sure if flow supports autocomplete with this yet.  @nmote do you know\n. cc @kyldvs who wrote format-js.\n. cc @kyldvs who maintains this\n. Hey!  There are currently no written guidelines for interfacing debuggers.  I can point you to some examples that might help you -- they all have roughly the same structure.  Nuclide currently supports 3 debuggers:\n1. LLDB -- works for local projects (and soon for remote projects).  Look in pkg/nuclide/debugger/lldb-{client,server}\n2. HHVM -- works for remote projects only.  Look in pkg/nuclide/debugger/hhvm and pkg/nuclide/debugger-hhvm-proxy\n3. Node and React Native -- works for local projects only.  Look in pkg/nuclide/debugger/node\nEach of these debuggers shares common UI code in pkg/debugger/atom.  Hopefully this is enough for you to get started.  I'm going to close this issue but feel free to reopen with follow up questions, comments, etc.\n. My guess is that you have some conflicting package.  I can't repro this on my machine and I only have Nuclide and vim-mode installed.  When you open atom you get a lot of redboxes that seem to be about the linter, so maybe the issue is that the linter conflicts.  I would try disabling the linter packages and other suspicious packages until the issue resolves, and then try to narrow the conflict down from there.  I'll assign this to Nat and he can close it if he doesn't have anything else to add to my response.\n. What do you think @matthewwithanm \n. Please include steps on how to reproduce this issue, what version of atom you're running, what version of Nuclide you're running, what packages you have installed, and any other information you think can help debug this.\n. When you created a new issue there was a template for how to report your problem.  Please use that template.\n. Can you elaborate on what you mean by \"Console Header\", and \"fixed in debugged\".  I don't understand what the expected behavior should be.\n. Ah I see.  The workaround is to use the \"Console\" tab up at the top of the devtools.  We have a lot of debugger UI work planned for the next few months so stay tuned.\n. The Chrome Devtools UI has been deprecated in favor of the new debugger UI, and in the new UI the Nuclide console's prompt has the behavior you want, i.e. the 'clear' button's position doesn't change. Strange, I can't repro.  Does this happen every time you load Nuclide?\n. I believe this is fixed now, please try v134 and re-open if it's not\n. Where is your .buckconfig file and what are its contents?\n. Assigning Matthew for any Buck insight he might have.  What's the status on this @FlyingSeven?\n. @lenage the function that caused this error in the stacktrace was removed over seven months ago:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/49517d10f522100d6bd4e74a372bea963ef2bef4#diff-b825fd5d04802d4d33044727f93d6d25L61\nSomehow you're running the wrong code.  Maybe try rm -rf ~/.atom/packages/nuclide and then re-installing via the atom package manager?  The issue is definitely that you're running old code though.\n. Are you actually on atom 1.0.8 or did you mean to type 1.8?  Does your project have any other flow errors?  Running flow from the project root might expose something\n. Hmm ok.  Can you provide a real working code snippet that reproduces this issue?\n. Where does it say that Hyperclick on Windows should be alt+click?  @mostafaeweda has done some work in the past to try and improve the competition between multiple cursors and Hyperclick.  The current behavior is:\nWhen there are Hyperclick results ready, it's assumed you want to use Hyperclick instead of using the multi-cursor feature -- so, the event is prevented from propagating up triggering the multi-cursor feature.\nHowever, when the Hyperclick has no results, e.g. clicking at the end of the line, or on non-symbols we delegate to the multi-cursor feature.\nWe don't want to change away from ctrl/cmd+click for Hyperclick because it's a keybinding that a lot of editors choose.  One solution is to make it clearer when Hyperclick has given up or is otherwise not doing \"Hyperclick\" work, and has delegated to the multi-cursor functionality.\n. Does the error repro when you don't have a remote project added?  We don't use the fuzzy-finder package on the server so I don't think it's related to the remote connection.  It looks like the keybindings for Nuclide's quick-open are the same as atom's fuzzy-finder.  Does the modal that pops up when you use cmd+P or cmd+T look like the screenshots here:\nhttps://nuclide.io/docs/features/quick-open/\n. Ok it looks like in the open source version we have this mapping:\ncmd+T ---> opens quick-open (the nuclide package for search)\ncmd+P ---> opens fuzzy-finder (the atom-provided package for search)\nFor searching remote projects, you need to use quick-open.  I would also argue that you should use it for local projects as well :)\n. I've left some comments on https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues/233.  At this point I'm pretty convinced that the fix should be done on the fuzzy-finder side, and the workaround I've written above should work to get you going.  Closing this out now.\n. Thanks, sign the CLA and we can check it in\n. It could be an incompatible version of merlin.  @peterhal may know more\n. I think it's likely that https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/56ab72c51a405a5a576466e684b3c074ef924a8e will solve this issue, but it's hard to say for sure.  It'll go out with the next release, which should be today or tomorrow.\n. A lot of work has been done here, including launching a new UI for the debugger, and revamping the node debugging support.  Things should be up and running, but please open an issue if there are any problems, thanks!. Hi @ultragtx, we're currently in the process of revamping our node debugger and in the churn of things it seems that we did in fact remove our entry point to the node debugger.  In the next two weeks, we're going to re-release the node debugger, and it will have the ability to debug node processes running locally, as well as server-side (via the nuclide server).  Thanks for your patience.\n. Hi @fbunn, what does node --version report when run locally?\n. I have a fix in review for this issue: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/900 which may impact this.. Well that's no good.  Is there anything interesting in your logfile?  It should be in /tmp/nuclide-unixname-logs/, the relevant lines should be prefixed with nuclide-debugger-php\n. For the subscription is not defined errors in this thread, I believe this may be fixed by 4cbf50cd12d6d6eaf86a92b7019beb4aee1336b4. Calling this fixed and closing out this issue.  Please re-open if you encounter this on a recent version of Nuclide.. Thank you @danmademe!\n. @zardra can you please take a look, thanks\n. @habovh We recently dropped support for some older versions of flow.  Looks like you've already figured this out, sorry for the inconvenience!\n. Excellent, yes we will be testing our build in the coming weeks with the new v1.13 atom beta and this will definitely be addressed. \n. @mostafaeweda can you take a look?\n. This looks really cool!\n. My guess here is that one of your installed non-Nuclide 3rd party atom packages is using a different version of React from the one Nuclide is using, and this is conflicting.  I'm not sure which one, but if you use atom with Nuclide as the only 3rd party package installed, then the problem shouldn't persist.  Please feel free to reopen this issue, and let us know if this isn't the case! :)\n. To be clear, you are selecting 'Go to Declaration' in the right-click menu, is that correct?  If you do this in the first file over the symbol styles it should move the cursor to the import line, and this is the expected behavior.  Is it not doing that?  What is the behavior you're seeing?\n. Gotcha, a workaround is to use hyperclick.  Hold cmd, hover the mouse over the symbol until it underlines, and then click, and it should jump to where the symbol is defined.  Not sure why Go to Declaration doesn't work, @nmote may know more.\n. The issue is with conflicting React versions I believe.  @vjeux has this issue on his radar\n. Sorry I missed this, there is a fix in React Native master.  See my comments in this issue: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/900\nClosing this as duplicate.. Hi everybody, I have a fix in review for this.  I'm going to explain what the issue was:\nCurrently Nuclide's RN debugger works by requesting JS from the packager, executing that JS in a Node process, and then debugging that process.  This strategy works pretty well but sometimes can be problematic.  The reason is that Node (and therefore Nuclide's debugger) uses V8 to execute JS code, whereas devices and simulators use a different JS runtime called JavaScriptCore (JSC).  The root cause of this issue turned out to be a discrepancy between how JSC and V8 handle the delete keyword.  This line was the culprit:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Core/InitializeCore.js#L160\nThis delete failed in a V8 context, and succeeded in a JSC context.  The expectation is that this property is a getter which is deleted after its first use, and replaced with the actual value inside the require.  Since the delete failed, the getter was never replaced, and ended up being called recursively, until a stack overflow occurred.\nBecause having the debug environment be different from the production environment is so hazardous, we're going to revamp the RN debugger so that it actually debugs code running inside JSC.  This will eliminate this class of (terrible) bugs, and give a more reliable and stable debugging experience.  Thank you for bearing with us!\nBig thank you to @matthewwithanm for gently pushing me to get a fix out for this!\nI'll follow up here on the status of this change, and which RN release it can be expected to be in.. The fix is now in RN master at https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a6844bdf7589b38297328e69f61e2986a129ab30\nRN has a monthly release cadence, so the schedule looks like this:\nRight now: You can build RN from master to get the fix\nOn February 1: v0.42.0-RC will be published to the releases page, here:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases \nand this will include the fix.\nOn March 1: v0.42.0 will be promoted to stable, and will also be available on the releases page.. @wellyshen If you're on Android, this guide seems helpful: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-building-from-source.html\nIf not, then you could try asking in the RN repo. The release candidate containing the fix is out, if somebody wants to confirm that this issue doesn't repro anymore.. Thanks @jesseschalken!. Hmm this changed somewhat recently, the play button being active is dependent on setting your current working directory (right click in the file tree on your php project root directory and choose \"set current working directory\").  Your project should also have an .hhconfig at the top I believe.  If this doesn't work, then you can go through the debugger selection UI, (cmd + shift + A) and select PHP and 'attach'. Closing this out, feel free to re-open if my suggestions don't work for you.. Thanks @maxbrunsfeld!  I just landed the fix and it'll be in this week's release.  That doc was helpful :). You can start the RN debugger in a much simpler way from the command palette.  Open the command palette with cmd+shift+P, and search for 'React Native' to find the 'Start React Native Debugger' command.. Historically this RN debugger has given users some trouble, see https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/900.  If you want to try an experimental debugger, you can choose iOS Webkit Debug Proxy in the debugger selection modal cmd+shift+A.  In the latest release this is renamed to the more appropriate Mobile JS.  Feel free to re-open if none of these suggestions work for you!. Here's how you can attach the JSC debugger for Android:\n\nStart your app, and make sure the packager is running.\ncmd+shift+A to open the debugger selection dialog\nSelect iOS Webkit Debug Proxy  in the Type dropdown (apologies for the terrible name, I'm fixing it soon)\nChoose Android in the `Environment dropdown.\nPress the Attach button and triggering your breakpoint should pause execution.\n\nI will say that I'm not optimistic about console.log working, but that should be a simple fix that I can prioritize.  As for the breakpoint not setting... do the files you're trying to set bp's in have extensions that are not .js?   We used to do some filtering based on file extension.  Interesting that it also doesn't work in Chrome.. Are you on the latest version of Nuclide?  Those errors in the console are normal (unfortunately).   Will the debugger pause your app if you insert a debugger; statement in a codepath that you know is hit?  If so then the issue would most likely only be with BP resolution.. Could be related to https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/900.  If someone wants to build React Native from master (or wait until early Feb for the RC to be published and try that) and confirm that the issue still repros, that would be useful information.  The difference between these two issues could be explained by different versions of RN, or different versions of iOS.. Closing as fixed.  If you still have issues please file a new task and include detailed repro steps, along with the versions of RN, node, OS, etc that you are using.  Thank you!. A quick look doesn't show that we're assigning any custom properties to the marker that I can see.  I think it's likely that there is a codepath inside atom that can assign custom properties to a marker.  A google search for similar issues turns up a lot of different results:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=github+atom+issue+Function.extractParams\nClosing this out as a wontfix, feel free to re-open if there is more compelling evidence that we're actually violating this deprecation.. Hi @jrajav, unfortunately our Windows build isn't a high priority for the team, though we do have a few team members who have done some work on this (@ebluestein).  I wouldn't necessarily expect all of our tests to pass on Windows.  If you're interested in running a specific test, you can cd into the package directory and run the test manually.  E.g.\ncd Nuclide/pkg/nuclide-flow\napm test\nIf running tests in a server package (e.g. nuclide-debugger-php-rpc) you need to use npm test\n. Hey @zakiaziz I wonder if it's possible that atom auto-upgraded you to Nuclide's v0.208.0 (which was just published a few hours ago) on the client, and this mismatched your server version.  It seems like upgrading the nuclide npm package on your server to v0.208.0 will fix the issue.. This looks like nuclide is a dependency of a different package.  Were these the steps you followed?\nhttps://nuclide.io/docs/features/remote/#nuclide-server__setup. I wonder if the old Nuclide server is running on your server machine?  Can you check for rogue node or nuclide processes and kill them?. I think this is because of how you're starting the server manually.  Can you try killing the nuclide server on your server machine, and then add a remote project from the Nuclide client?  That should cause Nuclide to spin the server up by itself automatically.. Hi @tugrul, unfortunately Windows support in Nuclide isn't a priority for the team right now, so we have rough edges like this.  In this case, our path-handling logic seems busted for the case when you pick a partition root.  It should work if you choose a subfolder of the partition root, e.g. C:\\path\\to\\my\\repo.. Open the electron devtools with ctrl+shift+i and then in the console something like this should do it:\n\n. You may also be able to delete it from the persistent storage, I believe it's in ~/.atom/storage/application.json. @jgebhardt has informed me that we have a long outstanding issue that underpins this problem: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8800, namely that determining the font family in a canonical way is non-trivial\n. Are you able to share the contents of the log file it references?  The one in /tmp/nuclide-xhvozdik-logs/server-start\nIt may have some relevant information.  Also are you sure that those ports are open on your server?. It looks like you might have an old Nuclide server running on your linux box.  Can you try killing any node processes with the word 'nuclide' in their name, and trying again?  You shouldn't need to start the server manually on your box either, the client should do that for you. Are you editing this PHP code locally or remotely on a server?  Do you have hack and HHVM installed?. Nuclide's autocomplete is powered by Hack.  You can install it with brew install hhvm and it should work. Let's change \"required for debugging\" to \"recommended for debugging\".  Theoretically our PHP debugger works for zend as well, since both Zend and HHVM speak Xdebug.\n. This migration is in the release going out this week FYI\n. Can we change this from cmd+shift+y to cmd+shift+a (which is another keyboard shortcut that does the same thing).  I'd like to remove the cmd+shift+y binding\n. Let's change from \"Output Window\" to \"Console\"\n. ",
    "JoelMarcey": "We have a new page of keyboard shortcuts now. I hope that resolves this issue:\nhttp://nuclide.io/docs/editor/keyboard-shortcuts/\n. shipit!\n. The docs have been updated. Closing this! :)\n. @danharper Thanks for finding this. \nCan you actually make the change from master instead of gh-pages. There is a docs directory in master that gets sync'd with gh-pages. In essence, gh-pages is read-only for us. I should clarify that.\n. Thanks @vjeux!\nI accidentally merged this directly from GitHub. I need to bring it internally. So I had to revert. But I will get it in there. :)\n. Ahh! Nice catch. Thanks!\n. Can you please sign the CLA so I can import your pull request? Thanks!\n. @DimitrK Hi. Thanks for the pull request. I have two internal diffs out right now that update the README as well as clarifies our current (or lack thereof) support for Windows. These two diffs will override this current pull request.\nI am going to close this. If for some reason my diffs are not accepted, I will re-open and consider merging this instead as a stopgap.\nThanks!\n. Will require us to update Nuclide Mercurial prerequisites in the docs to show how to get full support\n. @markmiro Sorry it has taken so long to get to this. \nWe have a troubleshooting doc that this might fall better into.\nhttps://nuclide.io/docs/help/troubleshooting/\nThe file is at: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/docs/_docs/help/troubleshooting.md\n.

When I press Cmd-D in the iOS simulator, I see....\n\nAm I behind in a version or something?\n. I am going to leave this as a starter task that should be looked at in the next week or two.\n. That's a good question. Will the console be used anywhere outside the debugger under normal circumstances. I was thinking Basics would be for those features that would be of everyday use, throughout your Nuclide session and workflow.\nMaybe just having the toolbar button documented and for the debugger is ok.\nYou can probably add the toggler keyboard shortcut to the keyboard shortcuts doc. The shortcut is https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/e93bbe4cd0d25bf442656cccc7b372441d96b59e.\n. Yeah, I think this might have gotten take out at some point if iirc. It is not in the pkg directory, so I am going to close this issue.\ncc @bolinfest in case I am mistaken here.\n. @hansonw is the above question something you may be able to answer?\n. Let's close it!\n. @vjeux installed Nuclide on Windows last night by following similar instructions like we have for macOS and Linux. \nWe should document that we can install on Windows -- see which features are good now since this issue was made and what may need work still.\nI also know @Daniel15 is a good resource for Windows (I believe he uses Nuclide on Windows sometimes).\n. I just went ahead and made a pull request with the fix in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/760\n. @zertosh Just saw this. Sorry.\n@modocache There are few minor grammar and formatting issues that I would have recommended updating, but nothing major for sure. I am glad to see this!\n. Oh the spelling was just fine I think :)\nJust some minor, nitty re-wording. I can comment in this PR.\n. Reading it again, I think that is it. Like I said, minor :-)\n. Looks great!\n. @facebook-github-bot shipit\n. @facebook-github-bot import\n. Looks like the shipit bot isn't working very well. We can land from the internal dashboard instead.\n. Just a few things to update. But general improvement. Thanks!\n. Yeah, it looks like we are going to have to get your local branch in a good state before we can land this because of the conflict... I can help you see what can be done there.\nBut, the content changes look good.\n. Just thought about this ... are you finding that any of the images are woefully out of date. If there are just minor indescrepencies, it is probably ok not to update (otherwise, we might be spending all of our time updating images) -- but if there are big changes, please go ahead update the images as well.\n. @zertosh We wanted to eventually do that with all our images, right?\n. Oh, yeah, agree. We will do it on all new images. Just gotta get around doing it on the the old images :)\n. cc @zertosh \n. @zertosh -- want to get your blessing on this before I land it. This affects 177 images. Updates seem reasonable?\n. I will land this soon - I am going to have to land this manually, given all the binary files.\n. A couple of small nits, but good improvement here.\n@johnislarry -- anything seem out of place in this update.\n. having to import this manually given the binary files. So will land internally.\n. :) @zardra If you want to just fix in your doc, I can close this. Either way is cool with me.\n.

Looking good.\ncc: @zardra \n. https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/a993b4eda4aad4868784ee3063ab7471234e4595 closed this\n. closes #789 \n. but we can land that in a different diff\n. @modocache Is Swift also supported too for Context View? Or just Objective-C?\n. I can get the images aligned height and width -- but some then look stretchy. So, I am trying to put my CSS hat on to figure out how best to solve that problem.\n. One option is that we take the current images on the landing page, re-screenshot them to exactly the same proportions and then use a specific img.width in the CSS and set img.height to auto or something.\n. I got something that doesn't look too bad.... I think :)\nBasically, in _base.scss force the object to fit in the container, even if we have to crop a bit.\n```\n.gridBlock {\n  margin: 20px 0;\n  padding: 2vh 0;\n.twoByGridBlock {\n    padding: 0;\nimg {\n  margin-top: 6vh;\n  width: 670px;\n  height: 370px;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n```\n\n. Then we can add some to gridblocks.html to check for the last picture, and if is an odd number (e.g., the 7th picture), then center it.\n. Ok, to center an odd item, I added a center tag in the YAML. We would basically only put that if we have an odd number of images to display on the landing page. Then I said, if that center tag exists, we use this new centerInGrid styling that moves the margin of the gridblock over to the middle. It is 25% and not 50% because we are in a 2x2 grid styling.\nSo these are the changes you would make, where the + signs are.\n\nNote in gridblock.html, it is not a mandatory change. I just indented the <img tage for readability.\n\n```\ndiff --git a/docs/_data/features.yml b/docs/_data/features.yml\nindex ecc333a..1f238b3 100644\n--- a/docs/_data/features.yml\n+++ b/docs/_data/features.yml\n@@ -44,3 +44,4 @@\n     noise. \\\n     Read More\n   image: images/docs/promo-working-sets.png\n+  center: true\ndiff --git a/docs/_includes/content/items/gridblock.html b/docs/_includes/content/items/gridblock.html\nindex 8fb8331..d79b5f8 100644\n--- a/docs/_includes/content/items/gridblock.html\n+++ b/docs/_includes/content/items/gridblock.html\n@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@\n-\n+\n   {% if item.image %}\n-  \n+    \n   {% endif %}\n   {{ item.title }}\n   {{ item.text | markdownify }}\ndiff --git a/docs/_sass/_base.scss b/docs/_sass/_base.scss\nindex 40b2117..1e3c46e 100644\n--- a/docs/_sass/_base.scss\n+++ b/docs/_sass/_base.scss\n@@ -700,6 +700,10 @@ a.blockButton {\n       width: 50%;\n     }\n\n.centerInGrid {\nmargin-left: 25%;\n}\n+\n     .leftBlock {\n       padding: 40px 20px;\n     }\n```\n.

Could rebase this pull request against that commit, so we don't have any merge conflicts. I know, simple change, but it would just be cleaner that way; otherwise, we have to manually resolve conflicts, etc. Thanks!. Thanks for going through the trouble of doing this. . Awesome! Thanks so much @benbalter. I am looking forward to this landing and trying it out. Then we can look at adding this to other sites as well.. Hey @zertosh -- can you have a look at this and make sure what you had on the unified blog post is captured enough in its new place. I believe other parts are captured within other parts of the docs.\nWhen you give your ok, I will land this.\nThanks!. This is fixed now. I have to fix this manually for the time being. Due to an issue we are trying to work with GitHub to get fixed. Hopefully this problem is resolved permanently early next week.. Sorry for the inconvenience. . Thanks @zertosh for the non-jquery suggestion.. @mostafaeweda Did you mean \"revert\" that commit?\ncc @jgebhardt \nCould we have a nuclide setting that can be toggled with respect to dialogs (or just this dialog) as a happy medium? Or is that too granular of a setting?. no \",\" here.\n. Wondering if PATH should be PATH?\n. No sorry, I meant the second comma.\n. spelling - s/enviroment/environment\n. Probably could link to the actual Hack and Flow pages that we have at nuclide.io. But not a stopper for this pull request, unless you want to when making other updates.\n. So, in theory we can find stuff in files.... but it depends on the type of project you are working on. Maybe we could say something like:\n\n, including *OmniSearch, which quickly displays recently opened files, quick searches for files based on partial names and, depending, on the project, can search within files for symbols, etc.\n. Should we add \"by\" like \"You can also search by filenames in your project....\"?\n. Nit: Could probably link to the source control section we have (Mercurial) here, but we can do that in a different pull request if you want.\n. At the time this was written, it wasn't always the case you would see a confirmation. However, I think theoretically, it should be \"will\". I won't block landing this because of that, but that can be changed in another pull request.\n. remove the \"is\" after \"shows\"\n\ncomma after \"file\", I think .... \"file, while...\"\n. nice addition \ud83d\udc4d \n. It, of course, doesn't affect the rendering --- I would have pushed it --- but I think it should be \"will\", even if it doesn't always show up all the time currently. Documenting more for what should happen rather than what does :D\n. Wanted to get your thoughts here...\nInstead of pointing to a specific Atom version that will change over time, does it make sense to say something like:\n\"culminating with a version of Atom that is equal to or greater than that specified in Atom's dependencies under \"atom\"\"\nOr is that too much?\nI am just thinking that way we don't have to continually update it. \n. I assume you meant to keep this here for future reference? I think it is ok to have it as a comment.\n. You can probably delete this image if it is not being used any more.\n. ...same here with respect to deleting it.\n. I think I was wrong from the beginning...\nit is \"Xdebug\" - no capital D.\n. Is this true any longer given the new interface? I know there is a setting to go back to the old chrome dev interface, but in general, the new interface is a bit different now, right?\n. Good idea -- [Autocomplete](#features__autocomplete) \n. Ok - we can land this and think about whether we want to remove that sentence or not.\n. I think this should be \"Xcode. However, there...\"\n. Maybe we should do the same like we did with Atom and point to the package.json file so we do not have to keep up with version information. What do you think? Would do the same in the Linux part below too.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/package.json#L114\n. Same here to point to https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/package.json#L114\n. <3\n. I think you meant to put a link in [Nuclide Settings](), right?\n. s/got to/goto\n. Ahh - good catch! Our template uses docid. Nuclide changed it to pageid. Will fix. \n. s/Content View/Context View\n. Should the commands be code formatted?\n. The images seem to show Swift code; but Swift isn't listed as one of the languages above. Should Swift be listed here?\n. Oh, are they? ... oh yeah, I guess they are. Thanks!\n. Does it make sense to be less specific on the version here and say like we do in another places...\n\nA version of Node that is equal to or greater than that specified in \u201cnode\u201d (under \u201cengines\u201d) in the package information\n. We should think about whether this stands alone as its own feature (i.e., that would live on the docs sidebar). I am not convinced either way right now.\n. I assume the Flow and Hack inline type check are the same look since you reused the flow image for the Hack section?\n. I think it might be best to remove this completely, along with updating the blog directory itself so that it can't be accidentally stumbled upon by people who know the link. In fact, maybe we redirect the blog page to the Nuclide home page or something.\n\nSo, change https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/nuclide/master/docs/blog/index.md and remove all the Jekyll {% .. %} stuff and put a redirect under title: Blog  that says:\nlayout: redirect\ndestination:  /\nSomething like that.. like index.html for the docs does: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/docs/docs/index.html. Actually, not sure / will work, maybe you could use an absolute URL https://nuclide.io. You can experiment :). Btw, I saw remove this instead of commenting out because we can easily revert this when we want a blog again and better not to have blog artifacts lying around until then.. Your stuff here seems like a good pull out of information from the blog.. I think we can be a little simpler here. And we may not always have a sidebar, possibly.\n\nThen, to find out more about using Nuclide, see Basics or any of the other guides available in the Nuclide documentation.  \n\nWhat do you think?.

First of all the way nuclide is trying to locate the binary even when specifying absolute path, is essentially running which flow or if the absolute path is filled out which c:\\some\\path\\to\\flow.exe. The problem here is that windows doesn't have the which command. I borrowed it from the git mingw binaries. I copied which.exe and msys-2.0.dll to c:\\unix-utils and added c:\\unix-utils to PATH. The second problem is that Windows is case-insensitive when using environment variables. And I have added the my unix-utils path to the already existing Path environment variable. But when nuclide access' the environment variable it does it by process.env.PATH which unfortunately was not where I added the path.\nSo lastly I renamed the Path variables (both system-wide and local) to PATH, now I just restarted atom and it worked.\nNote: I have downloaded the pre-compiled windows binaries and extracted it to c:\\flowtype and added that to PATH as well.\nNote: My Git for windows is faily new, and I found the unix-util binaries at C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin on my x64 windows 10 machine.\n.

Mostly looks good, just:\n1. simplify the boolean expression (see inline comment)\n2. change the docblock here to document this behaviour: https://github.com/chenglou/nuclide/blob/format-opts/pkg/nuclide-code-format/lib/types.js#L13\n. :+1:\n. Solved by 0.126.0.\n. We just pushed 0.126.0 which solves this. cc @zertosh\n. This will be fixed by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/716. Thanks @jesseschalken!\n. Thanks for trying us out! We should definitely do this. In the meantime, I'll at least update the docs to indicate that this is a requirement.\n. This might've been safe to ignore. Were you able to do things remotely as usual after the error appeared?\n. Ah, okay. You can just close and ignore the message (although as mentioned, Nuclide may not be able to automatically update when you manually change files via the command line - e.g. via git commands, or using another editor).\nYou can also try installing Watchman to get full functionality and stop the warning. (instructions are here: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)\n. I suspect the exception from minimap is the root cause here, throwing off Atom's built-in buffer destroy behaviour. Perhaps we can handle this better, but have you reported this to the minimap package yet?\n. Fixed in c6fadf8dd3996fc6e97ec40f60444849c27b99a8. We'll probably release this next Monday, apologies for the inconvenience in the meantime :(\n. Hi - I think this is due to an incompatibility with the atom-hg package. You shouldn't use both atom-hg and Nuclide, as Nuclide's hg implementation is not compatible (and it looks like we provide a superset of the features that atom-hg does, including diff view). Could you try disabling atom-hg?\nAre there any features in atom-hg that are missing from Nuclide?\n. Hmm.. was this file recently added? Unfortunately, the file indexer we use in quick-open won't update itself unless you have Watchman installed (https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).\nThere are two workarounds for now:\n1) remove/re-add the remote directory, or kill + restart the Nuclide server remotely\n2) manually restart the file indexer process; pkill -f nuclide-task/lib/bootstrap.js should do it.\nSorry about the inconvenience. This is where the logic happens, if anyone feels like making a PR: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-path-search/lib/FileSearch.js#L88\n. What are the full permissions of ~/pkg/nuclide-server/scripts/nuclide_server_manager.py? The read/execute bits for 'other' should be set (755).\n. Strange.. I believe the permissions are set to 755 by default. Could it have something to do with installing the package as root? I don't think that's necessary to get it to run.\n. cool! thanks for the report\n. Hi @arielelkin, sorry about the misleading message: the autocompletion in the Buck targets is a little broken at the moment. You can enter the buck target as you would on the command line and ignore that message; pressing Run should work regardless. I'm working on a better autocomplete at the moment!\n. Hmm actually it looks like the react-native init script does not enable Buck for iOS at the moment.\nInstead you should use the non-Buck instructions available here: https://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/#running-applications__command-line\n. Seems like some kind of React version incompatibility - @ssorallen or @zertosh, have you seen this kind of issue before?\n. Hey, I'm having trouble reproducing this (granted, I'm not using Windows). I'm using terminal-fusion with a Nuclide remote connection at the moment on Mac OS X and things are going fine.\nCould you provide some more information perhaps?\n1) Could you copy + paste the error logs from the console? or\n2) Could you provide a screenshot of the terminal that appears with a remote connection open? If you can get it to appear at all.\n. @yinghuitan can :)\n. Done!\n. Should be fixed by acc805f (hopefully will be released next Monday).\n. 175 is out, please re-open if it happens again.\n. Hey, thanks for the PR! This is also used on Macs, though, and it doesn't seem like python2 is available by default there.\nCan you check if python2.7 is available on Arch/Ubuntu? I'd be happy with that :)\n. Perfect, thank you! I'll get this merged in.\n. Could you upload your Nuclide logs to pastebin or similar? They can be found at\n$TMPDIR/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log-2016-*.\n. Looks like we're failing due to \"Unknown system error -126\" trying to resolve your remote directory. Strange that it works in 0.168 since we haven't really touched that codepath.. the only Google result for that error links here, which isn't too helpful: https://github.com/dart-atom/dartlang/issues/1084\nNot sure how to debug further, sorry :(\n. You have the package flow-ide installed, which is probably not compatible with Nuclide. Could you try removing that and trying again?\n. Hmm I managed to reproduce this. It looks like when Atom opens an atom:// URI, it adds an atom: project - then we try to detect the nearest HG repository with findHgRepository, which enters an infinite loop.\n@mostafaeweda or @shushz, any idea what the best fix is?\n\n. Nuclide is indicating that it can't find flow (ENOENT). You can either add it to your PATH or set its location manually in Nuclide Settings.\n. @jgebhardt: I assume you're thinking about this?\n. This is not an issue with our usage of flake8 - actually, it seems that flake8-commas just does not support running from stdin (which is what we do).\nA simple repro is to just run flake8 - < test.py with your test input.\nIt looks like flake8-commas needs to be fixed. Here's a more correct plugin, flake8-quotes: https://github.com/zheller/flake8-quotes/blob/master/flake8_quotes/init.py#L8\nYou can either persuade the flake8-commas maintainer to do the same thing, or make A PR there :)\n. Could you upload your logs somewhere so we can see if anything sticks out there?\nThey should be available at $TMPDIR/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log-2016-*.\n. Oh.. just realized you're on Atom 1.12. We don't support that yet, unfortunately. (Looks like we need to build some new binaries, but I'm working on it)\n. You can leave it- I'll close this it's fixed in 1.12 :)\n. This is fixed in 0.176 (we still don't have full compatibility with 1.12 though.)\n. Can you look at your logs again and tell me what's in there? We've added new prebuilt native modules for MacOS so it should be fine..\n. @imwithsam One thing that I noticed with your repo is that it doesn't have a .gitignore, so the file indexer is indexing everything in node_modules (this contains 25K+ files, which shouldn't be a problem, but maybe your system is having trouble with it). Atom's source control functionality will also be bogged down by having 25K untracked files. Try adding node_modules to your .gitignore and see if that helps.\n. @K-Leon is this remotely or locally? If you are connecting to a remote project check the server logs as well.\n. @johnryan could you have a look at your logs as well? should be $TMPDIR/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log. Look for any messages with the word \"fuzzy\".\nAlso, while the spinner is going, could you open the Nuclide Health pane (you can find it in our toolbar, menu bar, or cmd-shift-p) and attach a screenshot of the process tree? Thanks\n. @johnryan thanks! weird that nothing from the file searcher seems to be present... could you also check the JS console when the \"File search indexing\" spinner is going maybe?\n. Open the devtools via cmd-option-I (same as Chrome)\nOn Fri, Nov 18, 2016 at 12:04 PM, John Ryan notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@hansonw https://github.com/hansonw how do you check the JS console?\nSorry i'm not too familiar with debugging this stuff.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/794#issuecomment-261628466,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAjPYmpOoY_mGx12E5jYJwbkOFoStMk-ks5q_gTZgaJpZM4KUYy_\n.\n. @johnryan: Amazing! that's exactly it, I think.\n@zertosh Do you know why this would be failing in the open source build? (it's from nuclide-task which I think you modified to require the transpiler via --transpiler)\n. @johnryan after some digging, we realized that codepath would be getting triggered if you have the babel-core package installed somewhere globally (e.g. ~/node_modules or ~/.node_modules). If you don't need them, a simple workaround for now would be to delete babel-core from there. Not sure if that's true for @K-Leon or @imwithsam as well?. @imwithsam can you check your JS console as well when the indexing spinner is going? cmd-opt-i on Mac OS. Thanks!. I actually have a pending change that touches this code. If you don't mind, I'll just incorporate this change into my diff to avoid conflicts :D\n. Included your change in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/e466e158be1d6cf60020e421a73d9a6821083dc2#diff-39f6ff4e40573f868dbc45fc0501cf56R274 :) Thanks!\n. @matthewwithanm made proper \"Nuclicons\" for this. Thanks anyway!!. I would recommend setting this with flake8's built in configuration mechanism - adding a .flake8 file to your project root. You can also create a ~/config/flake8 config file for all projects. Nuclide and linter-flake8 will both respect this by virtue of flake8 picking this up.\n\nYou can then indicate ignored rules with\n[flake8]\nignore = E501\nSee http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html.. @nmote The linter package does what you mentioned in its implementation here: https://github.com/steelbrain/linter/blob/v1/lib/linter-registry.js#L65 so I think that's reasonable. I'd imagine you would return empty to invalidate the current messages.. For the time being a lot of these fb-only requires are preceded by a // $FlowFB so uncommenting this line https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/.flowconfig#L31 in the .flowconfig may reduce the noise.. You can put a compile_commands.json file in each project root. http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html\nDoes that solve your use case?. I see. We have a long term plan to have per-project configuration in the form of a .Nucliderc or similar, but nothing at the moment. Note that there are ways to programmatically generate compile_commands.json databases based on make/build scripts, so I'd recommend that for now.. The flags are visible as flags to a clang_server.py process, so you can do ps ax | grep clang_server to see the flags. Do those match up?. The two Clang versions may not be in sync; we use libclang not clang\ndirectly. What versions of clang and libclang do you have installed?\n(probably check your apt packages). I'd recommend at least having libclang\n3.7+ installed.\nOn Tue, Dec 6, 2016 at 10:14 AM, Phil Hord notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nYes, thanks.

Oh... I think @modocache was also running into this before. I wonder why the clang binary and libclang.so behave differently here. The -### flag is a great tool, thanks for that - maybe I can figure out how to obtain those same flags somehow.. I found this related issue from YouCompleteMe: https://github.com/valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/303\n\nMaybe we can implement the heuristic of grabbing the paths from Clang :/. Keeping this open - although @AlexTalks's contribution will help quite significantly, I imagine we still want to do this by default :). Cool, thanks! Have you verified that these don't conflict with any existing Atom default keybinds?. Thanks for the PR! in the future please make sure they don't have trailing commas though (142c066). It seems we don't have any lint protection against this yet :(. Yes! Here's a detailed rundown of what happens with the default configuration:\n1) We establish an SSH connection to your remote server and then execute nuclide-start-server (or whatever you type into the Remote Connection dialog). [1]\n2) nuclide-start-server then starts up nuclide_server_manager.py, which randomly generates a HTTPS certificate, signing authority and client key. Unless you pass --insecure, of course.\n3) The Nuclide server uses these certificates to start an HTTPS WebSocket server. The cert/CA/key is then passed back over the SSH connection and stored in the Atom client, and also encrypted and saved in the OS keychain for easy reconnection.\n4) Finally, client side, the NuclideSocket class uses these credentials to establish the HTTPS WebSocket connection. All client-server Nuclide interactions go through this connection.. You'll have to be more specific. What language does your project use? Ideally could you provide a link to the github repo, if it's open source?\nAlso try looking in the devtools (cmd-opt-i) for any errors/warnings.. OK. Note that Hyperclick relies on Flow for Javascript projects, so make sure that's set up and enabled for your files (i.e. they have the @flow header.). This is fixed in ef68b6517b860; unfortunately it wasn't patched into v0.192. It will be fixed next week for sure, but in the meantime the Command Palette \"Reveal Active File\" (cmd-shift-) should probably work correctly.. Our node debugging support is very much experimental. It seems that it doesn't respond to console commands yet, but I managed to trigger a breakpoint by pressing pause and then continue (play) to resume the process. Maybe @yinghuitan can comment on other features.. Ah, that might be trickier. Can you try nodemon with the --debug flag (provide a port)? I'm not sure if we'll be able figure out the port, but it's worth a try.. Sorry, just got back from vacation. Where is your compile_commands.json relative to your remote project root? It needs to be either at the root or symlinked there (i.e. it can't be in a subdirectory). If you added it recently you might have to restart the server to pick it up.\nYou can check the server logs remotely via $TMPDIR/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log to try and debug.. Ah cool. Glad you figured it out! :). Thanks, LGTM!. Check out the example in https://buckbuild.com/rule/cxx_binary.html for a example of a simple binary using Buck (https://buckbuild.com/setup/install.html).\nThe output should be in buck-out/gen/echo or similar.. The \"run\" workflow isn't supported for binaries yet, unfortunately. (We find that many binaries require some kind of piping to be useful, so we haven't found this to be a pressing need).\nCould you try \"Nuclide > Clang > Clean and Rebuild\" from the menu to see if that fixes the warning? Otherwise, try opening the dev console (cmd+alt+i) to see if there's any messages that indicate why the flags couldn't be found.. Oof, looks like just getting the Buck Websocket port takes 1-2 seconds on a Mac. I can probably add an option to skip that, since it's not super critical.. dc829a14ea4ea60b9355b9123a48883dbed3f5b2 and 20e02820661bdccfee320bdb2493ed29b3e0f3f6 should go a long way towards fixing this. They should be coming out next week. No idea. Maybe the author @oclbdk knows?. Hehe, will import the other one instead. Thanks :). It looks like symbol-gen is not compatible with Nuclide's remote projects (in general, we don't have a good way for third-party packages to work with remote files and directories at the moment).\nHowever, if you generate a tags file remotely by yourself, Nuclide can pick that up and use it in the Cmd-T results as well as for Hyperclick support. You can probably just copy https://github.com/weskinner/symbol-gen/blob/master/lib/.ctags into your remote project and run ctags by yourself :). The .ctags file is the configuration for ctags. looks like the symbol-gen package runs ctags --config=<path to .ctags> but it might just pick it up automatically.. probably ctags --help will reveal everything :)\nNothing else should be necessary. Note that we unfortunately cannot support remote cmd-r and cmd-shift-r at the moment, as there is currently no API within Atom to integrate with these.. Yes, exactly :)\n\nOn Jan 31, 2017, at 11:09 AM, Yuankai Z notifications@github.com wrote:\nIs it related to atom/symbols-view#204 ?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Nice, this is cool! I'm a bit reluctant to add a one-off configuration file for this (ideally Nuclide should have one definitive file for project-level configuration), but since we don't yet have a plan for that I'm happy to take this for now. Just keep in mind that if we ever create a .nucliderc or similar we will probably migrate this over :)\n\ncc @a20012251, this may be useful for what you're working on too\nI'll find some time to review the code in detail, but some bikeshedding first ;)\n\nMaybe we should make the file 'hidden', as is the standard for most configuration files. Perhaps also make the naming a bit more generic, i.e. .nuclide_clang_config.json.\nI think it's a bit redundant to have both extra flags and extra includes, when one is a special case of the other. Plus this adds ambiguity in terms of the ordering. Can we just let people add the -isystem to their flags manually to simplify the API?\ncopts and nocopts are a bit cryptic. How about extra_flags and exclude_flags?\n\nSo in summary the file would look like {\"extra_flags\": [...], \"exclude_flags\": [...]}.. Actually I see in your code that you already used extraCompilerFlags and ignoredCompilerFlags.. I like those, so let's be consistent? {\"extra_compiler_flags\": [], \"ignored_compiler_flags\": []} then. Good stuff, thanks! Yeah our GitHub -> Phabricator flow will squash all your commits and close this PR. Just going to pass it through internal review first. Yes this is in v0.204! Check the PR for docs (the C++ docs section was updated). @janosimas have you seen https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/916? libclang seems to be unaware of the default system header location, so you have to extract them via clang -### -c <file>. @steelbrain Thanks for this - we'll actually upgrade to 4.5.0 if https://github.com/steelbrain/package-deps/pull/89 gets in! ;) A little hesitant to take on a bunch of extra dependencies that will be unused. Also:\n\ninstallRecommendedPackages is reserved for internal use so we don't want to remove that\nWe'll want to leave promptUser to false, as we want to really ensure that our internal Nuclide users install these packages.. Dang, we should probably add python2.7 to the shebang in nuclide_server_manager.py. Will take care of it. If you're using Atom 1.19 the new remote file implementation should work with encodings!\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-remote-connection/lib/RemoteFile.js#L355. Are you using the 'ssh-agent' authentication method? I can't think of what else would trigger that kind of error.\n\nYou can enable debug console logging in the ssh layer by adding debug: console.log in the connect() calls here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/801931c28bca1cce17a73a3b6e4f44113fd887a8/pkg/nuclide-remote-connection/lib/SshHandshake.js#L239; maybe that'll help?. @vtambourine You can just modify your local installation in ~/.atom/packages/nuclide/pkg/nuclide-remote-connection/lib/SshHandshake.js for debugging. I probably don't have time to get around to this, but I'm open to a PR (or maybe @AlexTalks is up for it! :P). Unfortunately, filename searches use the crappy fallback matcher on Windows.\nWe need to spend some time setting up prebuilds for the native matcher over at https://github.com/facebooknuclide/nuclide-prebuilt-libs. This is because we have activation hooks tied to the grammar names. I just added language-cpp14 to it - you can also modify pkg/nuclide-clang/package.json manually, or activate the nuclide-clang package manually in the meantime :). You can actually type in relative paths like ../file-copy.ext to make copies above the current directory! For our use cases displaying the full relative path tends to be too long, so we likely won't do that, sorry :(. Hmm... where is the path of your node binary on your server? Is it in your $PATH at login time?. can you check your Nuclide server logs for any errors? /tmp/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log. Anything in the Atom console when searching? (cmd-option-i). Many packages, e.g. atom-haskell-utils are not compatible with Nuclide and its remote file system, as you can see in the error message. In this case it's impossible to implement Directory.getEntriesSync for remote directories. Sorry :(. Please keep internal bugs to Facebook tasks, thanks ;) Also this looks like a temporary error unless you can consistently repro this. (Also try removing the incompatible package, as seen in your last bug report).. Can you upload the contents of your local logfile somewhere? /tmp/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log. Ah sorry it's $TMPDIR/nuclide-$USER-logs (mac OS is special). Hmm that seems fine, actually. I can't manage to reproduce this either.\nCan you also open the dev console (cmd-opt-i) and see if there's any warnings or errors in there? Maybe try just after you've reloaded Atom and opened Quick open.. Hmm I'm out of ideas, I also tried on another Mac machine + Windows machine and couldn't reproduce. Is there anything you can share about the repo you're working in? Also have you adjusted any relevant settings (check ~/.atom/config.cson)?.

Please file tasks for the Facebook version internally using the bug nub in the toolbar. Thanks. Glad you were able to fix it!. Open \"Nuclide Settings\" from the command palette and look for a flow path setting - try manually setting that to C:\\softwares\\flow-win64-v0.44.1\\flow\\flow.exe. Not sure why the auto-detect would be broken though :(. This seems like you're using the insecure code path \"nuclide-start-server -k\". Is that the case / if so, does this work without that extra flag?. Yeah sounds like we'd be happy to take this with the flow-typed list. Using the LSP set seems good (and then we can even start doing the kind -> icon mapping in one place so we don't have to do it for every provider!)\n\nI think:\nexport type OutlineTreeKind =\n  'file' | 'module' | 'namespace' | ....\nshould work. \"kind\" seems like a totally reasonable name to me.\nNote that our JS formatter (prettier) is pretty particular about how this is formatted; run eslint and it should be able to check your formatting.. thanks!. Good catch. Thanks!. Uh oh, looks like we're not compatible with the new text-editor implementation! :(. yay! When are these icons going to be in Atom?. @damieng should these be named \"Atomicons\" rather than \"OcticonsPrivate\"? Or at least that's what the PR suggests: https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14657. Thanks @maxbrunsfeld! Our remote editors have always had a custom async save so this particular piece is pretty painless. We're now using the new APIs in 1.19 so hopefully this is good to go :). Yeah the hyperclick package isn't well supported. I may do a release later this week, though..\nFor a lighter-weight package that includes Hyperclick, try out https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui :D.

Hi, can you check Atom's devtools to see if any error messages show up? (View > Developer > Toggle Developer Tools)\nI also just published Nuclide v0.244 if that helps.. Ah, okay. Atom has a cache for the native modules check, which you might have to manually override. Could you try running\n\nlocalStorage.setItem('installed-packages:nuclide:0.244.0:electron-1.6.9:incompatible-native-modules', '[]')\nin the Atom console? \"View > Developer > Toggle Developer Tools\". Good suggestion! We probably won't get to this anytime soon but PRs are welcome ;). The shortcut for code formatting is cmd-shift-C (or find it in the command palette, cmd-shift-P, under \"format code\"). You need to have a suitable provider installed, though - we'll use clang-format for C++ files or yapf for Python files, for example.. Oh dear - that package will be renamed soon - it actually only formats your requires.\nIf you want general JS formatting please check out https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom! :). This should be fixed as soon as you reload Atom. Please let me know if that doesn't do it.. We can just keep this PR on facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui: I'll sync it back up afterward :). I see you're at FB, could you use the internal bug reporting mechanism? Thanks!. Looks related to https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/issues/85.

Odd, somehow the native file search module is not loading for you (you're seeing the crappy fallback version). Can you reload Atom and see if something related to \"fuzzy-native\" comes up?

Yup you will want to make sure that both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled (the Nuclide client prefers IPv6).. Ah, https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/bb1b7c4c15e4699ae0b9b9be645b064986bd57fd made it so that the server process has 4GB of memory allocated to it. I'll see if I can make this a configurable flag.. In the meantime I guess you can stick with 0.266 (or modify the source locally to edit the 4GB limit). I am guessing that one of ide-css/html is returning invalid URIs :( Unfortunately these are not likely to be compatible with our context view. Sorry!. Please try clearing the APM caches and reinstalling as described in https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/issues/64.. Seems like an issue with the core Atom API screenPositionForMouseEvent. Please track \n https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15682 instead. Shit, sorry about this guys - I'll push the fix shortly. In the meantime there are two workarounds:\n1) Downgrade to v0.271.0\n2) In console, run atom.config.set('nuclide.useLocalRpc', false) and reload Atom\nv273 will have the fix.. I've unpublished 0.272.0 for now.. v273 is out with the fix, apologies for this one!. Any error messages in the Atom devtools (cmd-opt-i)? You can also check $TMPDIR/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log for additional logging; I'd check for any errors there as well. (A paste would be super helpful if you don't mind sharing that!). I just noticed that nuclide-js-imports-client was enabled for the first time in v0.273.0 as well. If you open the Atom devtools console, you can type atom.config.set('nuclide.use.nuclide-js-imports-client', false) to see if disabling that has any effect.. It'd also be helpful to mention what project(s) you're working on so I can try to repro; are these JavaScript projects or some other language?. Could you paste the contents /tmp/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log somewhere so I can see the full error trace? Also, if the JS project is public a link to the repo would be super helpful to repro :). Ah, we haven't added a good catch-all for non-Git repos on Windows. An easy workaround is to git init an empty Git repository in your directory (if you don't mind that). We might add the ability for Omnisearch to pick up rg --files if you have ripgrep installed, as it's quite popular these days.. Seems reasonable. Thank you!. Sorry! Known issue at the moment. The workaround is to disable the local RPC process by going to Nuclide's settings and unchecking \"Use RPC for local services\" at the bottom (or: atom.config.set('nuclide.useLocalRpc', false)). Unfortunately, there is no straightforward remedy short of bundling an ESLint server into the Nuclide server. @wanderley is currently working on it - we should hopefully be able to open source this at some point :).

Addressed in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/8d94af2676d8baa65ac4fadff20e20f94d5594f5 - will be pushed next week.. Yeah that seems correct (I might've made some assumptions about Facebook machines). Thanks!. Does password authentication work? I think private key authentication doesn't support passphrases right now (which it sounds like you have?). Closing due to duplication. Do you happen to have a node_modules in your home directory? Or are you setting a custom $NODE_PATH? Try to see if there's an older version of nuclide-commons somewhere else on the filesystem.. Ah, we've identified the problem now. @chmac's fix in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/1512#issuecomment-385614316 is the right one - or just use an earlier version. @matthewwithanm is going to unpublish the faulty versions.. Please make sure you restart Atom after updating Nuclide. Failing that, please try uninstalling and re-installing Nuclide.. Hey, did you install Atom from pacman? We've received reports of an issue where pacman incorrectly installs the wrong Electron version as a dependency, leading to a similar error for Nuclide's terminal: https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/issues/241#issuecomment-388630859\nYou can install Atom from the tarball in https://atom.io/releases as a workaround.. Atom 1.26.1 is using Electron 1.7.11. (Electron 2.0.0 has landed in Atom master and will likely be released in 1.28, though.). No easy fixes here, unfortunately! We'd welcome a community contribution here; the code that gets Python diagnostics is over here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-python-rpc/lib/PythonService.js#L457\nSince this is running on the server, the config would have to be read and sent up from the caller of this function (over in pkg/nuclide-python).. Seems like you've set your system Python version to 3, which APM doesn't really like (looks like it dies while trying to install \"fsevents\" which has some native dependencies.) Is it possible to revert the system Python version to 2?\nOtherwise you could stick to v0.301.0 of Nuclide, which doesn't have the \"fsevents\" dependency (which is included transitively by the \"jest\" dependency). cc @aaronabramov @captbaritone - looks like 'jest' includes some native dependencies, which can cause some unpleasant behavior.. Yeah I think the workaround is to rollback to v0.301.0 for now. (I don't know how to resolve the underlying 'msbuild' issue here, but we'll probably remove \"jest\" from the dependencies for the next release.). Makes sense! Re the original issue: do you mind also adding this to nuclide-flow? Flow is actually the main provider of autocomplete suggestions for JS files in Nuclide.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-flow/lib/main.js#L147. Perfect. Thanks for your contribution!. see #1541 - you'll need to downgrade to v303 for now.. Ah yeah we switched to passing the port option in as part of a JSON blob.\nYou can still use the --port=8080 flag but it has to be through the Nuclide UI:\n\nWe'll silently parse that flag out and put it into the JSON blob for you.. cc @semmypurewal - people are already using Nuclide with Docker :). I don't think there's any PHP / TypeScript integration for Nuclide at the moment, unfortunately. If you use HHVM/Hack, Nuclide should support your project, though.\nWe may be able to support configuring arbitrary remote LSP servers in the near future!. Thanks, just needs the CLA!. Ctrl+Shift+P isn't something that Nuclide provides - that's https://github.com/atom/command-palette.. Simplify the boolean expression! :P\n!A || A && B === !A || B\n. what do you mean? the second \"selectionRangeEmpty\" check is redundant, so it actually avoids an extra check - to clarify, what I mean is\nif (provider.formatCode != null && (!selectionRangeEmpty || provider.formatEntireFile == null))) {\nIMO it's just as readable - the explanation would be \"use me if the range is non-empty, or we're forced to because formatEntireFile isn't defined.\"\n. Make sure you document the flag exclusion as well.\nI would also specifically state that the additional flags are to be added after the ones in compile_commands.json.. This is a bit heavyhanded - just leave these as Array<string> in this state.. We only have one ClangFlagsManager for each remote server, so you need to also disambiguate by project. Also note that you need to cache the actual Promise, as otherwise this creates a race condition when multiple files are opened simultaneously. This should probably be a Map<string, Promise<?ClangProjectFlags>>. Nitpick: I would prefer writing this snippet as\nif (projectFlagsDir == null) {\n  return originalFlags;\n}\nconst projectFlagsFile = ...\nconst projectFlags = await this._....\nif (projectFlags == null) {\n  return originalFlags;\n}\nto avoid mutation & make the intent clearer. Nitpick: the slice is unnecessary. we can write this block in the functional style:\nreturn originalFlags\n  .filter(flag => ignoredCompilerFlags.indexOf(flag) === -1)\n  .concat(extraCompilerFlags);. After changing these to plain arrays the || [] should be unnecessary. As mentioned above, I'd just leave these as the raw arrays.\nAlso it's probably a good idea to make these fields optional in the config, so make sure you handle the case where they're null.. As mentioned above, you need to look this up by flagsFile. And you need to cache the promise- see the getFlagsForSrc cached vs impl pattern above. Let's use a real temporary directory for this test. We have a copyFixture utility (see https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/648d770f3f58794dbdcfa1b0d9ccf6ae484e1581/spec/clang-refactor-integration-spec.js#L25), so let's copy out the fixtures directory. The temporary directory will be automatically cleaned up so no need for the manual afterEach either :). The Atom code always keeps this non-null/non-empty (and we've Flow-typed it as such), so I think that's fine to assume here as well. Let's just inline options as {encoding} below.. Nuclide uses a transform to lazy-require all imports, so just import this at the top of the file in the usual way.. Something about this feels off. Does this work? Doesn't this implicitly encode the buffer as a UTF-8 string? Or does this work because the readFile call implicitly decodes into a UTF-8 string?\nIs that guaranteed to work? IMO it would be clearer and more preferable to keep the readFile call encoding-agnostic, let it keep returning a raw Buffer, and do the decoding here (as with Atom's implementation).. ditto. We've taken to using prettier to format our code so you gotta remove these spaces. It looks like this should be moved to rpc-types.js so you can actually use it from both OutlineTreeForUi and OutlineTree. Or is there something blocking that?. Can you actually make this kind?: OutlineTreeKind now? (Same above).. Ohh yeah.. unfortunately we don't have great docs about this :( atom$Octicon is not supported because that's a type from flow-libs, which the RPC framework doesn't know about. Rest assured that simple literal unions like this one should work fine.\nThere's an option in Nuclide settings called \"Use local RPC\" that is sufficient for testing this (just make sure Flow outlines still work, for example)..

    "micksabox": "@matthewwithanm opening Atom from the CLI did not work as well. Luckily, you put me on the right track and I realized I had another version of node installed in my $PATH. Once removed, the packager worked as expected.\n. @cco5566  what I ended up doing was symlinked the latest nvm version of node (mine is v5.0.0) to the path /usr/bin/node (If there was a node install there already I removed it). I think that Nuclide looks for the node installed specifically at /usr/bin/node, so just by symlinking it to the right version this solved the problem.\n. @Emilios1995 As per my answer above, I removed the existing node binary in /usr/bin/ and made a new file called node there, and symlinked it to the v5.0.0 version of node. I followed instructions here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1951742/how-to-symlink-a-file-in-linux. Basically, symlink is like a file redirect, so whenever something is looking for the node in /usr/bin, it will get redirected to the v5.0.0 version. Good luck.\n. Gotcha, thanks. I agree with you.

But my project has symlinks I can't just get rid of (in node_modules and .meteor).\n. > Reveal still works for everything that doesn't have a symlink in its path\nI'm afraid not. My open file is something in imports/components/...etc and there are no symlinks anywhere in there, yet the feature fails to work.\n. Aha, that's it! It's because all my web dev work is in ~/Sites which is actually a symlink to /Volumes/SuperData/Sites. So it seems like there needs to be some symlink resolution call somewhere.\n. The icons came back randomly for a while, and now they're gone again (between restarts). No rhyme or reason.\n. Ahh, I missed that option! I seemed to remember it auto-installing.. I guess that's not the case :) Thanks!\n. @jgebhardt Thanks, that works! However, it also increases the time it takes for the tip to go away when I mouse off of it, which doesn't seem right.\n. In addition, it takes two attempts at choosing \"Toggle Swift Toolbar\" to actually hide it.\n. It says \"Task runner is now displayed by default\" in the changelog - but the Swift toolbar is showing. That would make more sense to me if a majority of Nuclide users were using it for Swift.\n. > Having to toggle it twice is definitely a bug. Does that repro consistently for you?\nYep, every time.\nPS: I noticed for each folder Atom is run in, it remembers the open files, and if the Swift toolbar is open. Where is that information stored exactly?\n. > That uses Atom's workspace serialization. It's stored in ~/Library/Application Support/Atom IIRC.\nI don't think that's it. I did a grep -ri in that folder for some of my project names, and nothing turned up. I'm just looking for a way I can reset Atom's \"memory\" of a specific folder.\n. @matthewwithanm I sure did, thanks! You rock! \ud83c\udf7b . Cool, I'll keep an eye out for the update. Thanks!. @nmote I think you nailed it. I was using symlinks for my project folder, and I just stopped doing that.. now it seems fine.. Is it really Flow that's the issue though? It's returning valid information, it seems, but where I mouse over (in Nuclide) seems to make no difference. In other words, Nuclide is displaying the wrong thing.\nAlso, I forgot to attach a screencap. See below.\n\n. I disabled type hints. Kind of a shame, as it would be a useful feature.\n\n.

I've did the same as @courthead mention but it auto-enables again after restart.\nPlus, in Nuclide 0.239.0 I'm not seeing the option Enable the \"nuclide-file-tree\" feature, so I really don't know how to perform this so it persist even after Atom restart.\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks!. Just in case: when disabling the nuclide-file-tree package and enabling tree-view (default's Atom) the \"Current only\" option works fine.. In my case, I went to the root project at command line and ran flow, it gave me something like this:\nshell\nLaunching Flow server for D:\\dev\\my-project\nWrong version of Flow. The config specifies version ^0.45.0 but this is version 0.49.1\nCould not start Flow server!\nSo I've modified my .flowconfig to my exact same version. After that it worked like a charm.. This happened with Nuclide 0.236.0. It makes me want to disable the file tree, moving to Atom folder view. It's quite annoying. I've disabled the Nuclide's tree view going to my ~,atom/config.cson and replacing \"tree-view\" for \"nuclide-file-tree\" into the \"disabledPackages\". That works fine but it's doesn't remain after Atom restart, so I have to do it manually every time. =S. Hi @matthewwithanm. Point 3:\n\nIf you focus the file tree and use the arrow keys, it should change the selected file (at which point you can hit return to open the selected one). As far as I can tell, this is how Atom's tree-view behaves too.\n\nThat's exactly what I expect but it doesn't happens on my Atom instance under Windows.\nAbout points 1 and 2 it's a basic feature that every tree view have, so I don't see the reason to not support it. I mean, default's Atom tree view does it, so I think that any user that see it's tree view changed -without knowing that it would happen after installing Nuclide- it should at least contain the same basic features. It's very annoying copying and pasting using the right click and the mouse for it.\nI love Nuclide so far, but the tree view, without those points it's just a pretty pane and not a useful tree view, in my opinion..

But the highlighting of modifications still didn't seem to work.\nThen discovered that I also need to install watchman. Only found it out through the author of this issue mentioning it. The instructions for installing it are almost hidden at the end of the Setup guide.\nSo installed watchman 4.4.0 and initially things still didn't seem to work... then finally I realized that I have to wait a bit for watchman to notice the change and update the file tree highlighting. Takes like 5 seconds on my repository.\nI thought that maybe I can speed things up by defining a \"Working Set\", but apparently this feature has stopped working. It worked before, but now with updated Mercurial and Watchman it no more does. Attempting to create \"Working Set\" results in the following error in dev console:\n/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/config.js:1015\nError setting item in array: Validation failed at nuclide.nuclide-working-sets.workingSets, \"[object Object]\" must be an object\nTried to speed things up by adding a smaller subset of repository as the project folder. But things remained about the same... still a lag of several seconds between saving the file and highlight appearing in file tree.\nOh well... at least it works...\nBut now the file tree highlighting no more works with Git.

I agree this would be definitely nicer, but this is expected behavior, i.e. currently you must save to get diagnostics.\n. We're having trouble repro'ing this.

The error message seems to originate here which suggests you've got some ssh connection issue in your setup. Hope that helps!\n. Great idea! I believe @jgebhardt is working with you on this so I'll just chime in with a few thoughts :)\nI think a good specific use case would be integration with the very new and already quite popular \"Create React App\": https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\nThis is an example where the project files are dynamically created. So it's a good example of where static template formats will not work with a potentially important use case. React Native's cli (e.g. react-native init for new RN projects) is another example.\nMy perspective is that you can support both static template and dynamically-generated projects by structuring the new project wizard to be pluggable. So you have different providers for the different types of new file/project wizards, e.g. one for \"Create React App\" and one for a static template format. \nAnd the design of the API that supports the pluggability is informed by exploring both types of wizards. You could start off by looking at creating a provider for \"Create React App\", since that's already a proven/working system. And then for bonus points, explore a provider for the static template format (e.g. new React component files, new Xcode projects, etc). That could help ensure you are supporting a broad set of \"new wizard\" use cases.\n. The client and server have to run the same version. The simple fix is to upgrade your client/Atom version of Nuclide to 233. ",

You just won the bet, removingstrip_rootfrom.flowconfig` fixed it. Thanks.. For me 0.232.0 is the latest version, there is no update available.. Ok, then there is a problem with the update mechanism on my side.

When/After this is implemented, I think it would be very helpful if nuclide comes with a fs module that is a drop-in replacement for the system one, but also works with nuclide: paths.. Just wanted to say thanks for the comment, I ran into this as well and it turned out my clocks were off by about a minute. Resyncing them fixed the error. Would be good to have a better error message in this case.. No worries, hope you had a good break! I spent (one day of) my break trying to get nuclide works because it looks so amazing. :)\nMy compile_commands.json is in the project root (although from what I saw in the code it actually walks up recursively to try to find compile_commands.json). I did check /tmp/nuclide-$USER-logs/nuclide.log but it only has messages like\nnuclide - ClangServer-[$FILE] - created child process with PID: [$PID]\nwhich don't help diagnose this issue. I also looked at /tmp/nuclide-$USER-logs/clang/[$FILE]-[$BLAH].log, but that also doesn't contain any relevant messages.\nDoing a ps aux | grep clang shows process python2.7 /usr/lib/node_modules/nuclide/pkg/nuclide-clang-rpc/python/clang_server.py -- [$FILE] [$ARGS] where $ARGS are my default compilation flags.\nI also briefly tried adding debug log messages to my atom nuclide package as well as the npm nuclide package on the server, but didn't see anything relevant being printed (thus the question about how to debug and what's executed on client vs server). Might have been doing something wrong though.. BTW, there might be something wrong with my compile_commands.json since it's my first time trying to generate it \u2013 if there might be an issue there, let me know how to test the file too.. NVM, I was being silly :). The debug log messages I added weren't showing up because I was using console.log which apparently isn't printed to nuclide.log. You have to use logger (or in my case, just output to a file). Once I figured that out, debugging was pretty simple.\nTurns out I had a (invalid) compile_commands.json in one of the higher up directories that I forgot about, which was shadowing the one at my root. Once I fixed that, and added workaround flags for #916, everything worked perfectly!. Actually it seems to run properly on the selection in certain cases, but not in others\u2026not sure what the exact logic is under the hood. But in a class declaration, it seems to be reformatting everything inside the section (e.g. all functions under public or private), even if I only have one function selected.. ",

Having to maintain a separate file internally would be a hassle, I agree. I'm thinking maybe you would have to go that far though. Is there some way to conditionally set certain directives in the .flowconfig file from the flow command or anything like that?\nEven if there isn't, if a special comment pattern like $FlowFBRequire were used here instead of $FlowIgnore, you could add a line to the .flowconfig file like this:\n``` editorconfig\n[options]\nsuppress_comment=.\\$FlowFixMe.\nsuppress_comment=.\\$FlowIssue.\nsuppress_comment=.\\$FlowIgnore.\nsuppress_comment=.\\$FlowFBRequire.\n```\nThat way external users would have an easy way to ignore these errors without causing any trouble in the default case for internal users. You could then either just mention that this line should be uncommented for external users in the documentation or you could provide an option to one of the scripts which would do it automatically.\n. I've implemented this last suggestion. I think this approach shouldn't cause any problems for internal users and it's easy enough for me to just uncomment the one line in .flowconfig.\n.

With a bit hacking around in the inspector, I was able to determine that it is due to the container not resizing as the lines-tile-component in atom sets a position: absolute to the wrapped lines-component. I don't really know how Atom renders these lines and containers or how Nuclide renders type hints, but hopefully these can help you debug this further and even fix it?\n\nI am able to \"fix\" this by dropping away the position: absolute from the wrapper component as shown in this screenshot:\n\n.

I had \"show only diagnostics for current file\" checked.  There's about 15 more errors attributed to other files, including this one:\nError   Clang  my_hdr2.h  26   'stddef.h' file not found\n\nThis could be the source of all the other errors. \nFrom this FAQ:\n$ clang -### -c foo.c\nclang version 3.8.0-2ubuntu4 (tags/RELEASE_380/final)\nTarget: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\nThread model: posix\nInstalledDir: /usr/bin\n\"/usr/lib/llvm-3.8/bin/clang\" \"-cc1\" \"-triple\" \"x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\" \"-emit-obj\" \"-mrelax-all\" \"-disable-free\" \n    \"-disable-llvm-verifier\" \"-main-file-name\" \"foo.c\" \"-mrelocation-model\" \"static\" \"-mthread-model\"  \n    \"posix\" \"-mdisable-fp-elim\" \"-fmath-errno\" \"-masm-verbose\" \"-mconstructor-aliases\"  \n    \"-munwind-tables\" \"-fuse-init-array\" \"-target-cpu\" \"x86-64\" \"-dwarf-column-info\"  \n    \"-debugger-tuning=gdb\" \"-coverage-file\" \"/home/phord/git/bld_linux/purity/foo.c\"  \n    \"-resource-dir\" \"/usr/lib/llvm-3.8/bin/../lib/clang/3.8.0\" \"-internal-isystem\" \"/usr/local/include\" \n    \"-internal-isystem\" \"/usr/lib/llvm-3.8/bin/../lib/clang/3.8.0/include\" \"-internal-externc-isystem\"  \n    \"/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu\" \"-internal-externc-isystem\" \"/include\" \"-internal-externc-isystem\" \n     \"/usr/include\" \"-fdebug-compilation-dir\" \"/home/phord/git/bld_linux/purity\" \"-ferror-limit\" \"19\"  \n    \"-fmessage-length\" \"277\" \"-fobjc-runtime=gcc\" \"-fdiagnostics-show-option\" \"-fcolor-diagnostics\"  \n    \"-o\" \"foo.o\" \"-x\" \"c\" \"foo.c\"\n\nInvestigating further.. Maybe -cc1 is a red herring.  But I'm still parsing the faq.\nThis is suspicious:\n\nSome header files (stddef.h, stdarg.h, and others) are shipped with Clang \u2014 these are called builtin includes. Clang searches for them in a directory relative to the location of the clang binary. If you moved the clang binary, you need to move the builtin headers, too.\n\nMaybe I need to symlink my .so into a specific location instead of using it where it was installed by the OS pkg.. The FAQ says:\n\nthe default location to look for builtin headers is in a path $(dirname /path/to/tool)/../lib/clang/3.3/include relative to the tool binary.\n\nPresumably that \"3.3\" should be 3.8.\nMy libclang.so is at: /usr/lib/llvm-3.8/lib/libclang.so\nMy clang stddef.h is at: /usr/lib/llvm-3.8/lib/clang/3.8.0/include/stddef.h\nSo I expect to find stdlib headers at: /usr/lib/llvm-3.8/lib/../lib/clang/3.8/include\nI tried to symlink /usr/lib/llvm-3.8/lib/clang/3.8 -> /usr/lib/llvm-3.8/lib/clang/3.8.0 with no luck.\nBut this does work as a workaround for this problem.  I added this to each of my compile commands:\n-isystem /usr/lib/llvm-3.8/lib/clang/3.8.0/include\nMaybe there needs to be an extra setting for the system include paths, or maybe it can be discovered somehow with libclang.  In case it matters, my libclang.so and my stddef.h come from two different packages. Perhaps they are dependent on each other or some common package. I didn't dig that far. \nlibclang-common-3.8-dev: /usr/lib/llvm-3.8/lib/clang/3.8.0/include/stddef.h\nlibclang-3.8-dev: /usr/lib/llvm-3.8/lib/libclang.so\n\n. I guess that would work.  But it seems goofy.  :roll_eyes: It's always bugged me that this is hardcoded into the compiler, even for gcc, but I don't really have a better suggestion.\nIf you go this route, I expect this info is worthy of caching to avoid an extra fork every time.  And maybe worthy of providing the user an option to override with his own explicit paths.\nBecause, for example, on my system I actually have 14 different installations of the C++ stdlibs. There's even a better one to be had from llvm, and it might be installed in some user-defined location.. It occurred to me that RTags doesn't have this problem.  I looked at what he does there; I think he runs the compiler at startup and gets it to cough up the path.  But he also allows the path to be overridden by an environment setting.. As shown in the demo, deleting a file from FOLDERS tree view does remove the file from the UNCOMMITTED CHANGES tree view as well.  But when the file is deleted from (by clicking \"delete\" on) UNCOMMITTED CHANGES, it is only removed from the FOLDERS view until some other event causes the UNCOMMITTED CHANGES view to be refreshed.. This is a Git repository.. The video is a maybe a little too fast to show it, but when I deleted the first file, it never was removed from the list until I took some further action that caused a refresh. The file was actually deleted right away, but the file list never updated.\nHowever, I'm not able to reproduce it now.  Maybe it cleaned up in 0.188 already.. I see this was fixed separately in 50c638ead9c55895860c58f3730258f64281187a, but the documentation wasn't updated in that commit.  Should be easy enough to merge, still.. I checked some of them, but I'm not certain I checked all.  I did verify that the ones listed in the documentation do match what's in this change.. ",
    "wbinnssmith": "Good news! This feature landed :)\nYou can now hold command while hovering to get a preview of a symbol!. thanks for reporting @Tikam02. We have a fix for this coming in the next release of Nuclide :). this looks fine to me! what do you think @hansonw?. Your timing is pretty coincidental! We just open-sourced both flow-language-server and ide-flow (not yet in the atom package installer, but you can apm install it).\nWe'd love contributions or ideas if you've got them!. @idevelop we fixed this with this week's release. You should receive it in a day or two! Please reopen if not resolved :D. Hi @xclidongbo -- based on the context it looks like you're using Nuclide for Objective-C or Swift development.\nNuclide integrates with clang to offer autocomplete suggestions for Objective C, and does the same with the Swift compiler.\nIf you're using Objective-C, make sure you have clang installed and Nuclide should offer completions.. @xclidongbo if that's the case, you should definitely check out our page on React Native features in Nuclide.\nAs you might know, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language and it's difficult to build tools that offer accurate insight without explicit type structures and annotations. \nNuclide has fantastic integration with Flow, which will give you suggestions, diagnostics, and other Nuclide features right in the editor.\nIf you don't want to use flow, there are plenty of react native and JavaScript packages for Atom that you'll find useful.\nI'm going to close this for now, but if you have questions not addressed on the Nuclide documentation, let me know!. Hi @mban, can you try upgrading Nuclide to the latest version (0.252.0 as of now) and see if this issue persists? Thanks!. Just released a new version of Nuclide with a fix. Thanks for your patience everyone!. We shipped a fix in last week's release (338, I believe) that fixes this by making terminals behave like other Atom pane items. This way, if you drag a terminal around, future terminals will also open in that location.\nWe also changed the default location for the terminal to the bottom dock.\nWe also introduced a new command, atom-ide-terminal:toggle, to toggle the visibility of all terminals.\nThanks for reporting @Pawper!.

Disable/gray-out the task runner toolbar when the project root is set to a path that doesn't contain a Package.swift file. \n2. Update based on the current project root no matter what.

I'll run spell-check on it and submit fixes for what I find. :)\n. @Ben-G thanks for the feedback! A few suggestions to troubleshoot:\n- Off the bat, it's worth mentioning that nuclide-swift doesn't currently provide any syntax highlighting. The highlighting in the screenshots from the documentation comes from a different Atom package called \"language-swift\". nuclide-swift will soon include \"language-swift\" as a \"recommended package\" -- in the meantime, you might want to try installing it yourself (since I usually use it in tandem with developing Swift support, it might be related to your issue).\n- ~~You'll need to build your project before Nuclide can provide autocompletion suggestions. Have you built your project via the Nuclide toolbar?~~ Ah, never mind, I can see from your screenshot that you have.\n~~I'll try building ReSwift locally to see if I experience the same error.~~ I actually can't try this myself; I don't have Xcode 8 installed and so I won't be able to build a Swift 3 package (except on Linux).\n. Awesome!! Thanks for the great bug report.\n. @Ben-G Hey, so autocompletion and everything is working, huh? How's the performance? Is it mostly accurate? How are the snippets and tab support working?\n. By \"snippets\", I meant the fact that, when autocompleting a method, you can use the tab key to select each parameter:\n1. Type pokemon.att, use the up/down keys to select the method you want to autocomplete, then press Enter.\n2. The cursor will be placed at the spot where you can type the first parameter to the method.\n3. Press Tab to go to the next parameter.\n\nAlso type hints don\u2019t seem to be working for me\n\nYeah, those aren't done yet. I'm trying to figure out why I can't get SourceKitten demangling to work, which I need for that feature. But soon!\nThanks for all the great feedback!\n. Awesome, thanks for trying it out! One thing to note: autocompletion requires you to first build the Swift package via the task runner toolbar (see the docs; sorry I'd link them but I'm on a plane and the WiFi is super slow). Are you saying that autocompletion is limited to just the current file on Linux, even though it works well when you try it on macOS?\n. Hmm... I don't have any ideas off the top of my head. If you have some time to plug away at it, maybe try to diagnose the issue, that'd be awesome. Otherwise hang tight, I'll try to get to it soon.\n. That's strange. The error message you're seeing is coming from the Swift compiler. I would certainly expect this error message to be the same regardless of whether you invoke sourcekitten via the command line, or via Nuclide.\nThe nuclide-swift packages passes an additional set of compiler flags to SourceKitten here. It looks like those flags may be causing the Swift compiler to produce that error. That's strange, since the commands should be the exact ones included in the YAML file SwiftPM produces.\nThe best way to diagnose the issue would be to add a console.log to your Nuclide installation on the line that I linked to above. Take a look at the compiler arguments being passed to SourceKitten. If you invoke SourceKitten yourself with those same arguments, does it produce an error? If so, check the YAML file SwiftPM produces (I believe it's called debug.yaml or release.yaml. Do the compiler arguments in that file work? If not, perhaps this is an issue with SwiftPM.\n. > Issue was related with libraries of sourcekit.\nSo it was an issue with SourceKit and SourceKitten? Is there an issue on the SourceKitten repository, or a Swift JIRA bug report that explains what the issue was? I'm curious to see if I can help. :)\n. Thanks for the detailed report! It sounds like SourceKitten on Linux requires some additional environment variables to be set. Perhaps the best way forward is to provide Nuclide configuration options for those paths, so that users may set them to the correct paths and get SourceKitten working.\n\nBy the way, have you any plans to support swift modules or multiple files? For example I see we can't use completion in this case: use public/internal stuff from A.swift in B.swift.\n\nThis is definitely supported! I've only ever used nuclide-swift on macOS, and it can do autocompletion across files there. In fact, that's the main reason I built this package. :)\n. Hmm... I assume you did, but just in case: did you build the package via the task runner toolbar after having added both main.swift and Robot.swift? The compile commands need to be updated any time the files change.\nI'll try to take a closer look at this over the weekend.\n. Could you tell me which package you're working on, or share a package that the problem reproduces for?\n. Crazy idea, but: what happens if your package is at a path that doesn't contain any spaces? \ud83d\ude1b \n. Hahaha, love it. Alright, well, that explains things. Allow me to use this issue to track fixing the underlying bug.\nThanks a ton for the report!!\n. The Swift version shouldn't affect autocompletion. I'll look into this further. But first, could you confirm that you've built your project at least once via the Nuclide toolbar, as in the instructions here? https://nuclide.io/docs/languages/swift/#features__autocompletion\nAutocompletion only works for projects that have been built at least once.\n. Awesome, thanks. Something must have changed within SourceKitten. I'll take a look.\nKeep in mind that this package doesn't currently support autocompletion on single Swift files. It only supports Swift packages built with the Swift package manager. :)\n. OK, I'll try to get to this soon. An alternative would be to send a pull request to SourceKitten that allows both kinds of arguments to be accepted. See the discussion on that issue here: https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten/pull/231\nThe onus is probably on me here to update it, which I'll try to do. Pull requests would also be really appreciated -- it should just be a matter of removing the -- here and confirming that everything works.\n. No reason at all! Just have to make a pull request. I'll try to do that soon. :)\n. Thanks, @keith! Very much appreciated!!\n. All thanks go to @keith! Thank you!! \u2764\ufe0f \n. Looks good to me, thanks @keith!\n@zertosh How do I import it again? \ud83d\ude05 \n. I would be very surprised if Swift was also supported. I don't think it is.\n. Nice catch, thanks. I forgot to put the code in backticks, so <cursor> was treated as an HTML and so invisible. \ud83d\ude05 . Huh, I wonder... maybe to handle the case in which @\"foo\"<cursor>, and then typing ] should result in [@\"foo\"<cursor>]...?\nOh well. If it doesn't have a unit test, I think it's fine to change it. If that logic isn't working out, then dropping it seems like a good idea.\nThanks for working on this, @eliperkins! \ud83d\ude0d . Thanks, everyone! \ud83d\ude0d . Interesting, thanks for the report! What does Xcode do here? Does it start showing suggestions as soon as you type x.?\nYou might be able to fix this by modifying the logic here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/7421277382f3ad40495f64b7e7f2e6034a3b2b20/pkg/nuclide-swift/lib/taskrunner/providers/SwiftPMAutocompletionProvider.js#L45-L50\nBased on that code, it seems like the nuclide-swift package requests completion suggestions from SourceKit whenever the user types, not just when there's text after x.. If we're not getting completions back, then maybe SourceKit doesn't usually return completions for x.? If that's the case, and if Xcode does indeed show completions for this situation, then I wonder how we can get SourceKit to do the same...? Ideas welcome!. Yes, please do! If you think you're able, a pull request would be awesome. Let me know if you have any questions about how to get set up.. Yeah, I saw that API -- neat! Did you mean to leave this comment on the consumeCurrentWorkingDirectory line, though? I think I'll need the output service, to display the build output from SwiftPM.\n. That makes so much sense...! Ha, completely spaced on that. Thanks, will do!\n. Ah, that explains why nuclide-buck creates these lazily. Will do.\n. Wow, that looks awesome. Thanks!\n\n. You mean: \"On macOS it will use\"? Can do.\n. Should we have $PATH be monospaced here?\n. Should this be a link to the autocomplete section below?\n. +1, although to be clear, the images are of Objective-C.\n. ",

Is there any special convention you use for PR's? Such as using observables, providers etc..? I'm sending in a PR on adding CRA to Nuclide next week, it's pretty sweet. Allows beginners to avoid being in the terminal to get started with React, which I think is a major step in a direction that allows users to cut their learning curve down by a dozen in order to learn react. . If I use your convention, the process doesn't start :( Could be an error on my side. I can open a WIP PR at the start of next week. Right now I've only hooked up a homeFragment command with an spawn, so there's really not much to see yet. . I'm finishing this after the release of the webpack CLI.

This started with Atom release: https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.17.0\nThis is what we are seeing:\n\nIt opens on top of which ever pane you have currently focused. I think it is just a css issue due to renamed or restructured classes.\nWhen selecting a file it closes, so maybe this is meant to be a new modal dialog; but it isn't working right at all.\nThanks !. Actually I'm getting the same behavior with nuclide disabled. It happens if I split the pane.. I would guess this has to do with the new docks feature: http://blog.atom.io/2017/05/16/atom-1-17.html\nIt's good that there is an official API for sidebars and panels.. Oh. Very non-obvious. Glad you figured it out, thanks !\nYou can also drag the diagnostics down to the bottom pane.. Sorry, this is still really unusable.  You can drag the file tree into a sidebar, but the next time you open the project it is back to the main. Double click a file in the file tree and it opens in the SAME pane as the file tree.\n\n. Install nuclide.\nI will post other packages that are installed but I don't know what could possibly cause this other than nuclide tree view itself.\nSplit panes ? Off the top of my head that is core atom.. It might have been this https://atom.io/packages/pane-layout-plus that caused it.\nThough it looks like it is just calling atom core pane API: https://github.com/chemoish/atom-pane-layout/blob/master/lib/pane-layout-formatter.coffee\nI've disabled it and it seems fine for now.\nThis is what I've seen:\n\nIt affects all nuclide panels (File Tree, Diagnostics, Outline View)\n. You now have to drag the file tree into the sidebar. Drag it from the filename tab \"File Tree\" into the left edge. Look for the <  icon to appear. \nSame with diagnostics panel. But they aren't stable there, they will reappear in main when you reopen the project. Sometimes files are opened in the panel rather than the main area.  Doesn't work with splits very well.. Disabling nuclide and then re-enabling managed to clear them out. It was a serious performance drag.. ",

This should have been addressed in the PR that was just accepted..\nThe issue was with node-inspector, since that project it looks dead, I took an open PR that fixed the problem and updated that library here. \nBut my long term suggestion is to re-write this without node-inspector, using the inbuilt node debugger instead\n. I found the issue it's in NodeDebuggerHost.js , looks like its a Babel issue\nhttps://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-debugger-node-rpc/lib/NodeDebuggerHost.js\nInside you have the Constructor\n```js\nlet NodeDebuggerHost = exports.NodeDebuggerHost = class NodeDebuggerHost {\nconstructor() {\n    this._subscriptions = new (_UniversalDisposable || _load_UniversalDisposable()).default();\n    this._nodeSocketServer = new (_WebSocketServer || _load_WebSocketServer()).WebSocketServer();\n    this._subscriptions.add(this._nodeSocketServer);\n    this._close$ = new _rxjsBundlesRxMinJs.default.Subject();\n    this._close$.first().subscribe(() => {\n      this.dispose();\n    });\n  }\n```\nLine 58 is this._close$ = new _rxjsBundlesRxMinJs.default.Subject();\nLooking at the source this._close$ = new Subject(); it seems that when transpiling it's adding .default to the init method.. So I'm guessing babel is adding defaults...\n. I'm on the latest for both. Two different machines same problem. I go to the transpiled code and remove the default and it works perfectly. So yeah. There you go. @tsenterd basically turn this on Line 58 of \n.atom/packages/nuclide/pkg/nuclide-debugger-node-rpc/lib/NodeDebuggerHost.js\n```js \nlet NodeDebuggerHost = exports.NodeDebuggerHost = class NodeDebuggerHost {\nconstructor() {\n    this._subscriptions = new (_UniversalDisposable || _load_UniversalDisposable()).default();\n    this._nodeSocketServer = new (_WebSocketServer || _load_WebSocketServer()).WebSocketServer();\n    this._subscriptions.add(this._nodeSocketServer);\n    this._close$ = new _rxjsBundlesRxMinJs.default.Subject();\n    this._close$.first().subscribe(() => {\n      this.dispose();\n    });\n  }\n```\nInto\n```js\nlet NodeDebuggerHost = exports.NodeDebuggerHost = class NodeDebuggerHost {\nconstructor() {\n    this._subscriptions = new (_UniversalDisposable || _load_UniversalDisposable()).default();\n    this._nodeSocketServer = new (_WebSocketServer || _load_WebSocketServer()).WebSocketServer();\n    this._subscriptions.add(this._nodeSocketServer);\n    this._close$ = new _rxjsBundlesRxMinJs.Subject();\n    this._close$.first().subscribe(() => {\n      this.dispose();\n    });\n  }\n```\nBut really maybe you should wait till they rebuild this.. your choice man\n. It's a very hacky solution, the better way of doing it is to fix the problem with the compiler/transpiler. It's probably the reason. Ok I filled out the CLA\n. I don't work at Facebook. But it's not me that's gonna kill it it's the node-debugger package is now no longer maintained. Plus node has its own way of doing this. \nIt's slow for you because your doing it in chrome. That's not an ideal way. The most ideal way would be to use the built in debugger in node and access it in the IDE. \nFrom memory the new method can be connected to via some web socket of sorts. So when someone works on a way of joining the two then your good to go. \nAlso. Debuggers are supposed to be slow. That's just the way things are. If you hate the speed of debugging you should try debugging large scale Java applications. That is really really slow. JavaScript debugging is really fast by comparison. \n. ",

Also, jpsim/SourceKitten#223 was closed in favor of jpsim/SourceKitten#268\nI've had limited success running a Docker image based on norionomura/sourcekit:30 image in an Arch host and editing this line to allow SourceKitten execution on non-Darwin platforms. The autocomplete seems to be not so responsive and limited to Foundation or current file types, ignoring any imports from SPM dependencies, which I'm not sure if it's a nuclide-swift or SourceKitten issue to be honest since it could be related to the current \"partial\" requirement of a Swift 3 toolchain on SourceKitten's master.\nVersions:\n- Atom: v1.12.2\n- Nuclide: v0.177.0\n- Client OS: Dockerized Ubuntu 14.04 on 4.7.1-1-ARCH host\n. Yeah, I did build it a few times using the toolbar, making changes and seeing if the autocomplete would report them properly. I can't really try it on a macOS machine right now and didn't use nuclide for swift development on a mac when I could - what I said about it being limited is mostly based on what I expected from such a functionality, e.g., pressing ctrl+space on a Vapor 1.1 Droplet instance gives me no suggestions (sometimes only ones that where already used, but I think that's Atom's \"dumb\" autocomplete, not related to nuclide).\n.

Still not work (I followed the steps above, removed check for non-darwin systems and compiled code before testing).\nI didn't have any error notifications in atom, so there were no issues with calling sourcekitten. Then tried to debug it here. Exit code was 0 with stderror:\n<unknown>:0: error: unable to load standard library for target 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nBut SourceKitten worked properly via command line: completion.json\nI couldn't find anything how to solve this issue, I guess it can be related with my OS.\n- Atom: v1.12.2 \n- Nuclide: v0.177.0\n- OS: Ubuntu 14.04\n- SourceKitten: 9ede44\n- Swift: 3.0.1 release with SourceKit\n. Did more tests yesterday. Found location where sourcekitten works properly. Issue was related with  libraries of sourcekit.\nAutocompletion doesn't appear correctly for instance methods:\nlet a = []\na.  doesn't appear\na.a  appear\nKind source.lang.swift.decl.function.method.instance exists in sourcekitten's result. It's stdout logged by atom's dev console when I tried to complete a.\n. As you could understand sourcekit, sourcekitten were builded using docker, link. Norio Nomura has implemented custom build for sourcekit (link) in on linux, which not contains in main swift repo.\nIn the end we have only builded sourcekitten, some of dependencies were in docker containers. So I needed to solve problems with some of it:\n- error while loading shared libraries: libswiftCore.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n  It was solved by additional library path in .bashrc: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$SWIFTENV_ROOT/versions/3.0.1-RELEASE/usr/lib/swift/linux:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\" (i'm using swiftenv, $SWIFTENV_ROOT located in ~/,switenv\n- <unknown>:0: error: unable to load standard library for target 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'\n  I didn't find exact reason. But I think this error related with dynamic linking for stdlib. Probably in my case missed dependency in libsourcekitdInProc.so or libswiftCore.so (link, link)\n  Solved by adding in .bashrc:\n  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/usr/include:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\nexport LINUX_SOURCEKIT_LIB_PATH=\"$SWIFTENV_ROOT/versions/3.0.1-RELEASE/usr/lib/libsourcekitdInProc.so\"\n  Also sourcekitten should be located near libsourcekitdInProc.so, in swift/usr/lib/. Now my current path to soucekitten is ~/swftenv/versions/3.0.1-RELEASE/usr/lib/sourcekitten. I don't know why but it works only here althought I added LINUX_SOURCEKIT_LIB_PATH env var and tried to move sourcekitten to /opt/sourcekitten/. Anyway I added link of sourcekitten to /ust/bin.\nTo use sourcekitten I needed launch atom using terminal (sourcekitten should use env vars for normal work).\nIt's all. You can correct me, some of this stuff I did first time or long time ago.\nBy the way, have you any plans to support swift modules or multiple files? For example I see we can't use completion in this case: use public/internal stuff from A.swift in B.swift. If yes how soon?\n. It's great. But it doesn't work for me.\n. Yes, I did.\n. ",

Sorry about that @Rovack , there is currently no way to do that inside of nuclide.\nWhat I meant to convey in my previous post is that --port parameter was the only way to do it (although not inside of nuclide).\n. This has been fixed, the number of files shown by default has been restricted to 50 with the option for the user to see more.. @phord going through your video, the issue that I see is the lack of progress updates that makes it look like it isn't working. You are right, it does what for the repo status to update before updating the uncommitted changes. From the video it seems like the delete is indeed removing the files. Is there any problem other than the slow update of uncommitted changes that i'm not understanding?. I've seen this happen a couple of times with atom 1.10 if i'm right, but its not really a problem with uncommitted changes and its some interactions between the toolbar, file tree and atom together that is causing it. I was unable to narrow it down and find the exact issue as it wasn't a reproable case. Is this a 100% repro for you?. Was it a hg/git repo?\nAny errors on the console? (cmd + alt + i). Sorry about the delay in responding to this.\nReason I asked about the repo type is because some actions are restricted to 'hg' repositories.\nI found an issue where clicking anywhere outside the text displayed in uncommitted changes wasn't triggering the context menu, i've put put out the fix for it which will be out in the next release. If you still have issues with the context menu not showing up please update this issue.. This could mean 'hg' was holding the lock for some other operation, is this a consistent issue for you? If there is a set of steps you have to repro this feel free to reopen and update the steps.. I'm able to repro this, looks like the click event is getting funneled down to the Icon but the context menu shows up if you click anywhere else but the icon itself. I'm looking into pushing a fix for this soon.. Fixed it in v0.211. I tried the repro steps you gave and the conflict resolution completed successfully and nuclide removed the merge conflicts pane. Is this a 100% repro for you?. I've been trying to repro this but it seems to be working fine, on a side note I did fix a couple of bugs in the merge conflict flow, maybe this was a side effect of the previous bugs. Can you update to v211 and update if this is still happening?. Lets track this internally, i'm unable to repro this case.. Are you still facing issues installing Nuclide?\nIt could be that one of your other installed packages is using the deprecated method tmpDir\nPlease reopen if issue persists.. Ah, I found the issue, this is only going to be a problem on windows. I have the fix ready and will be addressed in the next release.. This is fixed in the latest release!. Ideally fetchBookmarks shouldn't timeout if it is able to access hg, is this a 100% repro? If not maybe the lock on hg was being held by some other command that was run.. Do you have a constant repro on this? Please reopen and also let me know if 'hg bookmarks' gives you results on the terminal.. You should convince this to happen https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2/issues/352 :)\nWe use the external ssh library . There is no active plan to add support for this but the team would be willing to review a PR for this if you'd like to work on it :). Can you please provide steps to repro this?. This could be a case of lazy loading and you could have updated to a new version and not reloaded atom. If this issue persists please reopen the issue.. I just verified this, on mac it uses cmd but on linux it uses the same keybinding as grammar selector. I've put out the fix for it. Thanks for reporting.\nThis will be fixed with the next release of Nuclide (0.241). I just started hacking around this, i'll hopefully have it up and running soon. Will update once it gets going :). I am extremely sorry for the lack of responses and updates here, this is unfortunately not on our roadmap, I did try to put in some effort into this but was unable to prioritize this. . I am extremely sorry about closing this without leaving an explanation.\nThe diff view is an fb internal only feature that at one point used to be open sourced. We had to do this because of how many fb specific features we were adding to it and over time the diff view wasn't providing enough value to external contributors and users. Unfortunately we weren't able to gate the context menu options to only show up in the internal build and this is one of those occurrences where the reference to diff view is externally shown. I'm sad to say this but the feature won't be open sourced :( . ",

It will be like enabling hell's power but an inch after an inch, instead of having all (if not all, a lot of it) or nothing?\nThanks again.. @nmote Ah, ok, there is a Use menu in the settings that offers to disable every feature one by one (I finally found it by mistake).\nMay you consider renaming this Use settings in Activate / Deactivate Nuclide features?\nMay you consider adding a disable all button, so anyone can start using Nuclide little by little? Disable every 94 (!) features take me a minute (and I code on several computer, has you may think).\nMay you consider adding a long description to every feature plus a hyperlink to the documentation (or the repository, if any)?\nThe settings panel is not very straightforward and easy to use IMO; it seems to be design as a configure what's in there by their technical name more than a choose and configure Nuclide features. Improving this settings pane would greatly help me in the use of Nuclide and the progressive activation of its features.\nMay you consider reordering those features, so instead of a disable button in a given menu, every feature would be described, would list every options they gives, and offers a disable button (like the Mercurial Diff Grammar, for example \u2014 which lack of context and a disable button, yes \u2014 but displays all its options in one place)?\nThanks a lot.. @nmote If I enable only nuclide-debugger and nuclide-debugger-node and disable every other features, the debugger won't show anymore.

It has been disappointing to see version control integration in the release notes that I can't use. \ud83d\ude1e Especially considering we are moving from PhpStorm which has state of the art Git integration.. Also broken when function occurs in a type parameter to a generic interface method:\n\nRemoving the type parameter on the method fixes it. For some reason generic methods (but not functions) get different colors for their name than non-generic ones, which is possibly related.\nI defined these types to work around it (the problem also occurs in the definition of these types, even with GitHub's syntax highlighter):\nhack\ntype fun0<+T> = (function(): T);\ntype fun1<-T1, +T> = (function(T1): T);\ntype fun2<-T1, -T2, +T> = (function(T1, T2): T);\ntype fun3<-T1, -T2, -T3, +T> = (function(T1, T2, T3): T);\nIt was bugs like this that led me to consider using token_get_all() to create a syntax highlighter in PHP/Hack to test Nuclide's highlighter against.\n. I can't think of any programming languages that are regular languages, since a regular language wouldn't be able to have nested parenthesis.\nAtom's language grammars (based on TextMate) allow recursive rules which means it can parse non-regular languages. Vim's syntax definitions are similar. It'd be pretty useless otherwise.\n. The brokenness I mentioned above with function parameters was recently fixed (probably by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/2c7e6aedbaadce16e1f2950224370d8a565113e3 ?) but the original issue with (function in a shape still stands.\n. What's the relationship with the tool-bar package? It wasn't installed by default by installing nuclide.\nInstalling the tool-bar package manually doesn't help. Restarting Atom doesn't help. Reinstalling and deleting ~/.atom and starting from scratch also didn't help.\n. @leeahoward @shushz That fixed it. My home dir is a Git repo with a .gitignore that ignores everything (link), and my project repo is directly inside my home dir, so Atom hides it because it is hidden by the repo it is inside of. That's definitely a bug - a project root should never be hidden.\nMoving the project one level deeper fixes it, but I'm not sure why, since it's still effectively ignored by the outer repo. Probably just a quirk of how Atom handles .gitignores..

I still can't install hg-experimental (for smartlog), but it seems to be working again.\nThe issue seemed to be tied to the fact that I relocated my brew installation away from the default location and into my home directory. However, when I moved the installation, there was still a ton of stuff left over in /usr/local/ that had to be wiped out as it was causing a lot of problems.\nAfter wiping out pretty much everything in there that didn't need to be in there, deleting ~/.atom and ~/Library/Preferences/com.github.atom.plist, properly reinstalling everything (mercurial, python, atom, etc), and rebooting, the issue cleared up.\n. Yup, that was it!

It seems like the debugger is still broken for some features. For example the react native debugger console will not log console.log statements and throws some weird errors. There's already another issue open about this #899 maybe it could be related.. hey just curious are you getting any errors in the console? @nanandn . ",

Atom's hyperclick package is pointing to the read-only mirror repo, so this needs to be synced with the latest release. No idea why there is this mirror in the first place, but here's the related issue in that repo: https://github.com/facebooknuclide/hyperclick/issues/5. ",

Since it was working until recently, something must have changed either in Atom or in my system. (No major system updates in a while, so...)\n. It's using the correct shell (/bin/tcsh). It seems to only be picking up the global .tcshrc and not the one in my user dir. And I'm starting Atom under my user, so it should be finding the right stuff.\n. ",
    "joshg111": "You are correct in saying that I am selecting 'Go to Declaration', sorry for being unclear. You are also correct in saying that if I select 'Go to Declaration' on the styles symbol it will move the cursor to the import line. \nWhat I'm saying is that when selecting 'Go to Declaration' on the value attribute of styles nothing is happening. The expected behavior from my perspective is that the cursor will be moved to the appropriate file and will be on the declaration of the value attribute of styles in that file. Or if the file is not already opened, then it should be opened, and the cursor moved accordingly. \n. I'm on ubuntu 16.04.1, and I have tried both 'Go to Declaration' and ctrl-click, but neither are working for me. Btw, ctrl-click is what i was using for my testing of other symbols which have declarations in the same file. Those are working fine, just not going outside the file. I'm pretty new to flow and nuclide, maybe I'm missing something. Did it work in your environment with these two files?\n. Also, when I hold control and hover over the other symbols which have declarations in the same file I see the cursor turns into the \"hand pointer\", but for the out of file declaration I never see the \"hand pointer\" when i hover over it holding ctrl. \n. I tried creating a plain object, and the hyper click works, so I think you're right. \n. ",

Perhaps that only makes sense once it's under flow-typed and can be pegged against atom's version\nI'll review and see where I can simply use the documented methods \ud83d\udc4d or see if I can add to the Atom docs. Many of these I inherited from the module I forked. Thanks for the review!\n. I was able to rewrite my module using only the documented APIs / existing flow annotations so I'm going to close this PR.

Please share the entirety of that log message.. @wellyshen Hmm, looks like the iOS Simulator logs are for some reason missing the standard tags that Nuclide uses as the default filter. Thanks for the help.. I think I have it figured out.\nInternally at Facebook, we have configured React Native via RCTSetLogFunction to log not only the message, but also [core.react]. This is how we differentiate logs coming from React Native apart from the rest of our app.\n@matthewwithanm Is there a mechanism to configure the default tag filter in Nuclide differently internally? The current default is very specific to our internal environment.\nSolution: Use ^(.*)$ as your tag filter in Nuclide.. @matthewwithanm We do not.

    "Alhadis": "I better weigh in on this...\nHi guys, I help maintain the File-Icons repository. I'm solely responsible for the mess I unknowingly thrust onto Nuclide's users, because I only just learned of its existence in the last 24 hours.\nThe reason your users are suddenly seeing this in their workspace is because the nuclide-file-tree isn't consuming Atom's icon service the way the built-in tree-view does:\njson\n\"consumedServices\": {\n    \"atom.file-icons\": {\n        \"versions\": {\n            \"1.0.0\": \"consumeFileIcons\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nNow, before somebody rushes off to apply a hasty hotfix, I better explain the other half of the issue: Atom's icon service is too limited to be of use to File-Icons. I had to monkey-patch five core packages with absurd gymnastics and Promise-riddled hackery to get icons updating correctly. This was necessitated by the Atom team's decision to keep the service \"simple\": that is, barring packages any DOM access whatsoever.\nNow, Atom's package code is easy to hack. Obviously, yours is not. I tried jackhammering Nuclide into cooperation with a MutationObserver to update element classes, which... uh... didn't go too well.\nTo TL;DR this for you: I'm in the final stages of developing our own icon service, which will obviate gorilla-punching the crap out of package classes at runtime. I urge you to use this first, Atom's API second. Here's how I did it when testing it locally with a fork of tree-view:\n```coffee\n    if service = IconServices.get 'element-icons'\n      service.addIconToElement @fileName,\n        path: @file.path\n        type: 'file'\n    else\n      service = IconServices.get 'file-icons'\n      iconClass = service.iconClassForPath(@file.path, \"tree-view\")\nif iconClass\n  unless Array.isArray iconClass\n    iconClass = iconClass.toString().split(/\\s+/g)\n  @fileName.classList.add(iconClass...)\n\n```\nAll that's left is to provide access to icons for directory elements, and then we're in the all clear. =)\nFYI, my knowledge of React/Flow is precisely zero, as it is with any modern framework. So I'm not sure I'd be well-equipped enough to submit a PR for this.... Integration is ready to go.. Paging @jacobmischka regarding the aforementioned \"community involvement\" factor.. @nmote Can you explain what you mean by this?\n\nI do believe that the Atom folks are generally very reasonable though, so if they had concerns about this API we may very well have the same concerns. I've implemented a stopgap solution that adds partial Nuclide support. Icons are still missing in some parts of the file-tree and OmniSearch, but it's better than nothing. Icons won't update dynamically either, and there're no icons being applied to directories (other than what Nuclide already applies), so this is still an issue.\n\nI noticed you've gone out of your way to support the package before, so I'm hoping you'll do so again. =). > Maybe @shushz can weigh in on whether we should move forward with this?\nPaging @shushz in the hopes of getting this looked at.\n7f09071 has me concerned Nuclide will eventually reimplement other Atom packages too, eventually introducing a change that's impossible to monkey-patch.. > With Nuclide this would be a non-starter, as one of the main focus areas for Nuclide is support for remote editing (on a remote host, that is).\nSynchronous stat-calls are only made for detecting symlinks and deduping resources based on their inode. If the stat-call fails, the resource is assumed to be either unreadable or virtual, and marked as such. In which case, the package is instructed to avoid making an attempt to scan its contents.\n\nCurrent approach in the file-tree is that everything that can be decided ahead of the rendering is, all data is kept in an immutable hierarchical data structure and the rendering is straightforward process from that structure.\n\nIf your rendering procedure is that restrictive, then it's better to use Atom's simpler icon-service. Anywhere in Nuclide where a [data-path] or [data-name] attribute is expected to show a file's icon should be instead using a call to the service hub.\nBottom line: the services API needs to be used one way or the other..

You can hit it and it reload even if e.g. your simulator/emulator window is currently in the front, not just Atom.

As @johnislarry said, many of the individual tests likely work, but there are large parts of Nuclide that don't work on Windows at the moment.

I cannot promise we'll get to them immediately, but I will try to take a look!. This should be fixed in the latest Nuclide.. @jesseschalken, sorry but we currently only officially support HHVM in the Nuclide debugger. Since we use the xdebug protocol, it is likely that other compatible PHP servers will work (at least to some extent) with Nuclide, but those setups are neither tested nor supported by our team.\nOf course, if you encounter an issue, pull requests are always welcome ;-). @ugendrang, what does it say if you run where flow at a command prompt?. That path looks reasonable, I would expect this to work.\nYou may want to try installing the flow-bin npm package:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/flow-bin\n. This should be working on Windows now. Please let is know if you still have an issue.. Unfortunately we are not supporting the react native debugger right now from Nuclide due to several issues such as this one.. Unfortunately the Nuclide file tree does not currently allow this, it always puts the cursor (and focus) into the text editor of the file selected in the tree, this is true for the selection that happens as a result of revealing in the file tree as well. This version is supported on Windows. What issue are you encountering?. With what do you need help?. Hey all, we are currently investigating this issue.

These paths are incorrect.. @fsi thank you for the detailed report. This change was made to mimic the keybindings of the file tree in Windows Explorer, but I see that this conflicts with what people are used to in Chrome and other browsers.\nWe're going revert that change, look for this to be fixed in next week's release.. Sorry @fugitifx , Nuclide server is not supported on Windows at this time. The startup scripts and server itself have many dependencies on *nix that have not been ported over to Windows yet.. Sorry, this is by design. There were significant issues with the Nuclide react debugger and we decided to remove it for now since it was broken and not actively supported. We will look into re-adding this functionality in the future.. Yeah #1041 regressed locating flow for certain configurations, a fix is on the way. . Thanks for the report! This will be fixed in the documentation in next week's release.. @nsrosenqvist how did you try to start the Nuclide debugger? From that error message, it sounds like you're attempting to attach the Native debugger to the HHVM server itself, which is not what you want.. Please be sure to either launch the debugger via the HHVM toolbar, or choose the \"Hack/PHP\" tab if launching from the debugger dialog.. lldb-server is no longer used. \nRemaining LLDB launch issue is being tracked here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/1531. The credentials Nuclide prompts you for are credentials for SSH'ing into the remote server. From the error code you're receiving (407) it appears your proxy requires authentication to establish a connection. I do not believe there is any way to do this from Nuclide unfortunately.. I'm not able to repro this with a recent Nuclide, since this issue is quite old I am going to go ahead and close it. Feel free to reopen if this is still happening.. We'd need more information to be able to help you troubleshoot this. Please let us know how you installed Nuclide, what OS and Atom version you are running, and what happens when you load Atom (are there any errors, for example?). Sorry, we cannot accept this pull request at this time because the author has not accepted the Contributor License Agreement. Please feel free to re-open the issue after accepting if you still want this PR merged.. Do you have LLDB installed and in your PATH?. Unfortunately, it is not possible to launch LLDB debugging with the open source version of Nuclide at this time. This functionality requires the lldb-vscode module, which is not available yet. \nA PR is pending to open source lldb-vscode here: https://reviews.llvm.org/D50365. You'll need to build and install lldb-vscode.  Instructions for building LLDB can be found here:\nhttps://lldb.llvm.org/build.html\nYou can then build lldb-vscode using ninja lldb-vscode.  The resulting binary must be available in your $PATH for Nuclide to find it.. @dragostis Rust support is not something we've looked into (yet) but might in the near future. Rust-lldb actually just sets up some type formatters for LLDB and then starts debugging. You can probably import those type formatters after starting debugging in Nuclide.  The Nuclide console allows you to run LLDB commands directly by prefixing them with a backtick ( ` ).\nIt runs 3 commands like this:\nscript_import=\"command script import \\\"$RUSTC_SYSROOT/lib/rustlib/etc/lldb_rust_formatters.py\\\"\"\ncategory_definition=\"type summary add --no-value --python-function lldb_rust_formatters.print_val -x \\\".*\\\" --category Rust\"\ncategory_enable=\"type category enable Rust\". Sorry, unfortunately installing this package standalone from source is not supported yet. You'll need to install Nuclide if you want to use the Java debugger at this time.. This is probably coming from atom-ide-ui\nTracked by https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/issues/287. This should be working in the most recent Nuclide..

Seems to be es6 / flow related. plain old functions are there but many exports functions are not. types and constants are not.\ne.g.\n type RowTransformer<T> = {[string]: any} => T;   --- in outline not in symbols\n\n\nis  in Symbols and outline\n\nfunction fieldToRowTransformer(fieldTransformer: FieldTransformer): ({[string]: any}) => {[string]: any} {\n   return (obj) => _.mapValues(obj, fieldTransformer);\n }\n\n\n-- is not in Symbols / is in outline \n const lut = Array(256).fill().map((_, i) => (i < 16 ? '0' : '') + (i).toString(16));\n\n-- is not in Symbols / is in outline\nexport function transformGroupedTable<T>(unTypedTable: Array<Array<{[string]: any}>>, rowTransformer: RowTransformer<T>) : Array<Array<T>> {\n  return unTypedTable.map((row) => row.map(rowTransformer));\n}\n\n\nIS in Symbols and outline\nexport function stringToTableLooseTyped(txt: string, ...fieldTransformers: Array<FieldTransformer>) :      Array<{[string]: any}> {\n      let result: Array<Array<{[string]: any}>> = stringToGroupedTableLooseTyped(txt, ...fieldTransformers);\n      return safeCheckedFirst(result);\n    }\n\n\nMaybe something to do with new es6 features as well as generic notation in flow??\n. So I guess when/if someone gets time to fix the symbols view (without having a symbols service API) this feature will not be needed. Will change from feature request => bug.

    "asiandrummer": "I should also mention that the community are looking to improve the GraphQL configuration and how-to by suggesting a generalized approach. There are still some action items to attend but the suggested JSON format for .graphqlrc looks pretty solid. Just wanted to surface this in case we want to include the actual JSON structure in this documentation, in which case we should make sure we update this doc when the language service goes under the change to reflect on the suggested format.\ncc @schickling. aaaah sorry @dpeek! I updated a bunch of things in graphql-language-service and completely forgot to update the documentation, especially around .graphqlrc (even the name changed to .graphqlconfig). I'll go ahead and change them right now. Apologies for this.\nIn a nutshell, there's now a different format for the GraphQL configuration file:\njs\n// `.graphqlconfig` file\n{\n  \"projects\": {\n    \"productName\": {\n      \"includeDirs\": [],\n      \"excludeDirs\": [],\n      \"schemaPath\": \"schema.graphql\"\n    }\n  }\n}. @kassens @steida my official recommendation for now is to include them in the .graphqlconfig file:\n{\n  \"extensions\": {\n    \"customDirectives\": [\n      \"directive @connection(key: String!, filters: [String]) on FIELD\",\n      // ...\n    ]\n  }\n}\nAlthough I think the language service should just hard-code them in the implementation.... @steida I'd say using .graphqlconfig to specify the custom directive is a valid fix as of now. We're discussing the possibility to embed the custom directives used in Relay in the language server, but it won't be anytime soon I presume. . Configuration setup instructions can be written here I believe. I took a pass using information from https://github.com/graphql/graphql-language-service#graphql-configuration-file-graphqlrc - please feel free to modify:\nGraphQL Language Service, to provide its full feature set, will need to know some information about your GraphQL development environment. .graphqlrc is a GraphQL configuration file that contains this information. .graphqlrc can define mutliple configurations for each GraphQL environment, should you have more than one.\nMake sure .graphqlrc file is configured and saved in your project's top level directory. For more information on how to configure, refer to this documentation.. Nuclide has access to the schema with the GraphQL configuration file (.graphqlrc) defined. I'm not sure where to put this information - still wanted to point this out.. ",

It would be most helpful to include the host platform (windows/mac/linux), the target platform/device, and your react-native version.\nAlso it may be helpful to review documentation at https://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/#debugging. see https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/1389, v0.271 will have the fix which makes the react native debugger selectable. @HessiPard ah thanks, I misunderstood your situation. could you make a new issue for your bug and include the react-native version?\nideally some code/repro example would be very helpful.\njust an initial hunch: an old node bug (because atom uses old electron which uses old node) sometimes prevents setting breakpoints at launch. it may work if you set the breakpoints after launch and reload the app.. @minhduc200585 sorry, a little one word bug in the 270 release prevented the menu option from appearing, but it is fixed for next time in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/7d568b475444e01ec7a9da2df8c889609a230420. Actually we have a Node debugger now (and have for several months)! It looks like the docs aren't updated but it supports both Launch and Attach entry points. Just use the 'start debugging' button and select the Node tab.. fixed with upstream upgrade. For c++ projects the task runner only supports Buck at the moment: https://nuclide.io/docs/features/task-runner/\nHowever it exposes a simple Atom service that would be simple to extend! See the sample at https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/master/pkg/sample-task-runner if you have interest in making a CMake task runner.\nClosing because it seems the original issue is resolved. . @matanster if you're on macos it looks like there's a package available. Otherwise I think you need to build buck from source. https://buckbuild.com/setup/getting_started.html\nIf you're looking to have C++ language feature support, then all you need is a compile_commands.json at the root of your project. If you use cmake then you can symlink it from your build folder.\nHaving buck is only necessary if you want to use the task runner toolbar (i.e. buttons to run, debug, test, etc.). With other build systems you'll have to trigger from a command line.. Hi @imdadahad, I will update the react native instruction docs on the next release to illustrate how to launch/attach the debugger.. it should be either later today or early tomorrow. update: the release 0.270 went out yesterday which includes the react native debugger, however a little typo prevents it from being active in the menu and it will not be visible until the next release.\nBut if you're itching to try it out then you can manually edit the line in ~/.atom/packages/nuclide/pkg/nuclide-debugger-vsp/lib/main.js and delete/comment out the return statement following the isOpenSource check.. @imdadahad  not yet, I wanted to sync the docs update with the working release.\nBut if you make the change I suggested you should be able to choose 'react native' from the 'attach debugger' menu and debug apps spawned by a running packager (aka metro bundler) as long as there is no debugger already attached. The debugger included here is a direct port of vscode-react-native@0.4.4 with some vscode-specific\u00a0parts removed. It looks like you're running into issue 581 which seems to have been fixed in their 0.5.2 release, but we haven't updated our port to match.\nFor now could you try downgrading to react native < 0.50? I have tested with 0.49.. https://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/#debugging. If you are trying to attach to a running packager then you will have to close the Chrome debugger first. . packager was renamed to metro at some point, try 'metro start' instead. looks like @font-family is one of the ui-variables a theme should define. (https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/static/variables/ui-variables.less#L84) which ui theme are you currently using @PointedEars ?. waiting on https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui/pull/459\nsimilar to https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/issues/14\n. thanks for the report, I was able to reproduce as well.. Please keep internal bugs to internal tasks \ud83d\ude00\nThanks!. duplicate of #1392 \n. hi, please report facebook internal (e.g. hack refactor) issues with the bug icon at the bottom left. this is a facebook-internal issue, please open a task/file bug through the bug icon at the bottom left. hi @tootwo2, could you also post your react-native version number? thanks for the report!. thanks, looks like this is known issue with vscode-react-native: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native/issues/613\ndoes it happen on every app? I can look into reproducing/fixing the issue. that message should appear if the packager has not started 60 seconds after starting the debugger. how do you normally run the packager? you may be successful using the \"attach\" option to put the debugger on that port.. hi @tootwo2 , sorry for the late reply: the retry/timeout line should be found at ~/.atom/packages/nuclide/modules/modules/nuclide-debugger-vsps/VendorLib/vscode-react-native/out/common/packager.js (it should be this line: https://git.io/vbh7m)\nBy default it checks 30 times, 2 seconds apart. Increasing either value would effectively raise the timeout. If you are still having trouble with higher values, I would recommend starting the packager separately and using the attach method to start the debugger.\nFor reference, that file is ported from Microsoft's vsocde-react-native debugger tool: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native/blob/master/src/common/packager.ts#L286 so you could post a question asking them if you can reproduce from vscode.. @Unforgiven-wanda yes, the react native debugger was dropped in June, but then re-added in release 0.271 by porting from Microsoft/vscode-react-native through our new vscode debugger protocol support. \nSince then I fixed a couple of issues related to handling source maps (bfd730b9c219bd8258fcc30ec6fcb18cf9255226) and mistakenly expecting a \".vscode\" directory to exist (7a4bcdb8ed005f825e26de684c85f6f48ccaf495). (see context at https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/1411). These fixes will appear in the next release.\nwhat version of react native are you running? the currently included debugger only supports <0.50 (fixed in new release by 5cc0055b9cc1055dc75375a21da23ef6a21c6fe7). @HessiPard  thanks for the detailed info, unfortunately I don't develop on windows but I can look into adding the sourcemap override to the available launch options.\nre: path not existing, the line which should be creating the directory is here: https://github.com/pelmers/vscode-react-native/blob/68a10569859a8ee0f958e63200de4d1f8f0e4bf9/src/debugger/scriptImporter.ts#L74\nhowever looking at the source again it appears it does not use mkdir recursively so it can only make the trailing portion of the path.. @lilin666 thanks, does your program also use source mapping?. @HessiPard yes my plan is to add the source mapping fields to the launch/attach dialogs very soon by porting from launch.json configuration of vscode! (probably by next release). closing by bfd730b9c219bd8258fcc30ec6fcb18cf9255226 , see updated documentation at https://nuclide.io/docs/platforms/react-native/#debugging\nthe new launch window looks like this:\n\n. Since this is a facebook-specific error, please file a bug with the internal task tool, thanks! (there is bug icon at the bottom left of the window). @velocityboy is currently on PTO! I imagine he'll reply in a few days. fixed in 639a755545f800284781208e5dbf079ade1fbfa9. which omnisearch provider is searching the ignored files? is it the filename search or the code lines search?. thanks, at least for the \"Code Search\" provider, whether it searches ignored files will depend on the underlying search provider used, which can be set in Nuclide settings under \"Code search.\" I know that ripgrep will follow gitignore but regular grep will not.\nRecently I changed the default to prefer ripgrep if it's installed but otherwise it will fall back to ack or grep.. I just realized as well there's a 'prefer git/hg grep if available' option checkbox which should also work without ripgrep.\nre: bundling ripgrep with Nuclide, that's something we can consider since vscode does that as well. In fact we may be able to directly include their https://github.com/roblourens/vscode-ripgrep.\nfor now though I recommend installing with homebrew if you're on macos. internal issue, please file a bug with bug nub at the bottom-left of the window!. a couple more question: which version of react-native are you running (react-native --version), and what target platform did you debug?. I did some looking and the same issue affects both the Node and the React Native debuggers (since their backends are both chrome).\nOur translator only looks at the output field of the output event and stringifies it. However the vscode debug adapter can also have a variablesReference field in the OutputEvent which should be expanded into the object contents: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug-core/blob/c07dc3f6b26fa0b4bac42c8aabeaf520c2e7e268/src/chrome/chromeDebugAdapter.ts#L999-L1000. There is likely going to be a major refactory of the translator code in the near future so I will leave this issue alone for now. As a workaround you can JSON.stringify when you console.log.. @rajivshah3 thanks for the feedback, as a quick fix for now I'll change the wording to make it clear it should be an absolute path. A bit later I can look into making the path relative to the workspace. \nremark to anyone who wants to make a PR, that would probably mean adding a bit of logic to this part: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-debugger-vsp/lib/ReactNativeCommonUiComponent.js#L76-L86 as well as passing the workspace path into the component (or fetching from atom's api). @rajivshah3 have you tried running it with the chrome devtools open? (cmd-shift-i on macos) There might be an error message or stack trace that could help find the issue.\nSince the launch/attach portion is UI code (i.e. runs in electron process) you can have console.logs and they will appear in the chrome console.. Hmm you're right, these messages aren't related to the debugger. If you're editing Nuclide from source, make sure you've apm link the correct location, see https://nuclide.io/docs/advanced-topics/building-from-source/. merging to #1576. actually we already have custom shell support! The documentation just hasn't been published yet but will be very soon. cc @rightparen . I've seen this issue too, currently I think there's no way to tell project search to only look at one project. I believe this depends on https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues/846 since they own the UI here.. closing, upstream bug. duplicate of #1461 , see instructions there. duplicate of #1459 , and I believe that 3704e5b1bb409f120e241b74272e2f6472e808a2 fixes it. fix is in: 889d1f278fc2f572dfc434a0a37e5510885e46f9\nwill be released later this week!. the error message here says that the name is too long, I believe that this relates to the 'commonName' field. What is the value of that in openssl.cnf?. @arhurMARNI  I think the certificates generator prefixes the common name with 'username.Nuclide' which might be making it go over the limit. I suggest taking a look at https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/1120 and picking a shorter name. @arhurMARNI have you tried again recently? f1c438f57abd47e7c57b336927a9ca8db5f1236a may have fixed a related parsing bug. please file facebook-internal issues with the bug nub at the bottom left of the window! (also steps to reproduce will be helpful!). since this is facebook-specific, please file a task internally with the bug button at the bottom left of the Nuclide window!. thanks for the contribution! This feature has been requested internally often as well.\nre: 4gb limit, that's been happening often lately and generally I just press the re-run button.. thanks @marudor ! I'll get this reviewed internally now. I did one quick change to make the default line size 1.5 and a number, so it matches the default editor configuration we currently use.. @Goom11 sounds reasonable to add a way to provide an adapterExecutable.\nit looks like currently the only supported ones are hardcoded in debugger-registry.js. What OS/gdb version are you using? cc @velocityboy . duplicate of #1434 . Hi, if this is still a problem -- how did you generate the compile_commands.json? Do you have a reproducing example?. The cause is a node version mismatch, we only distribute the prebuilt binary for node v7. for a fix see facebook/nuclide#1431. Hi, are you trying to debug the node process? I'm not familiar with koa.js but in general you need to launch node with --inspect=<debug port>, then that debug port is where you point the debugger. Make sure you're not trying to debug the port for the HTTP endpoint.. @yeswolf I cleaned up your patch and applied it, but I couldn't confirm whether it works because the swift integration is no longer actively maintained. . An option for the preferred location is likely to come soon. @wbinnssmith . Mentioned in https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/issues/308, but it's fairly simple to script the color selection.\nHowever deriving the colors from syntax theme in a general way is prone to inconsistencies because not every package defines the same colors. Our full list is in https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/blob/master/modules/atom-ide-ui/pkg/atom-ide-terminal/package.json#L140-L235.. If you write ~/.nuclide-terminal.json file with your preferred default shell then it should skip us calling dscl to derive it: https://nuclide.io/docs/features/terminal/#custom-shell. At the time I upgraded the library, I did check to make sure it worked with react native 0.50, on both android and ios emulators ( and android device ). What version of react native are you using, and what is the target type (device/emulator/android/ios)?. fixed in latest release. I can't reproduce this issue, can you check your shell's wraparound mode setting?\nrefer to https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/1359 for detail. Looks similar to #1561, a workaround is to write a ~/.nuclide-terminal.json config to specify a shell which would avoid the call to dscl.\nDocumentation: https://nuclide.io/docs/features/terminal/#custom-shell. thanks for report @BlueSkyInwind. could you share your react native version as well?\nIt's probably time to update https://github.com/pelmers/vscode-react-native/tree/nuclide again.... thanks for the info, I'll go ahead and merge this one with a duplicate: #1576 . @samuel-ye what Atom theme are you currently using? Does the same issue happen with using defaults such as Atom Light/Dark? Also do you have any custom styles defined in .atom/styles.less?. This nuclide version is quite old, are you running it as a workaround for #1576?\nOtherwise I suggest updating Nuclide/atom and see if it still reproduces.. Hi, sorry about this issue. It is safe to ignore and will be fixed in this week's release. Fixed by https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/commit/f625549e6102e6d3eaa1a20f4f57ab40f204fae7. thanks! I'll get this reviewed soon.. thanks! We'll import this change once the job finishes. thanks for reporting! However I think this issue is more suited to the flow repository (https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues), because Nuclide just surfaces what it reports.. updated, thanks!. Hi, to see all of the buck-related features requires having a .buckconfig setup in the project folder. I suggest starting from the ios buck sample: https://github.com/fbsamples/bucksamples/. Sorry I don't have a working example ready to link you at the moment. However the autocomplete features are only tested/supported internally on Xcode 9.3+.. Seems like a file is missing/corrupted, can you try uninstall + re-install nuclide?. That would be nice! however the Atom's find window is tied closely to the target being a text editor. See https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/blob/master/lib/buffer-search.js#L144.\nOne could bridge the text editor methods in Atom with the xterm search addon from https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/master/src/addons/search/search.ts\nBut I don't have plans to do this work at the moment.. The color settings in the menu only affect colored output from tools such as ls.\nYou can currently only change the foreground/background with custom CSS. See details at https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/issues/300.. Not sure about why it doesn't work on the material ui, the terminal does just pull the 'color' CSS from the terminal-pane div: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/c77ce65ea50f95e797190a695570de6ed8fb24f0/modules/atom-ide-ui/pkg/atom-ide-terminal/lib/terminal-view.js#L772-L775. Ah, I just tried it and the issue is that the theme uses transparency, which must be enabled separately for the terminal as well.\nGo to the nuclide settings (cmd-alt-comma) and find the Allow Transparency option under the Terminal section. Then make sure it's checked.\nYou can also find this in regular Atom settings under packages > nuclide, but it's a bit harder to find there.. I wasn't able to reproduce this case, here's how it looks for me using Material UI + Flatwhite syntax and no custom CSS styles.\n\n. @w-hc do you have a workaround for the issue?\nis there a chance it's related to this bug I filed on vertical split dock items to Atom? https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17963. The terminal should be serializing the last known location and opening new ones there. If you put a last-opened terminal at the bottom pane and reload Atom, the new ones should go there too.. maybe fixed by a199693ac048545a02843bbb7537da841636ae52, though I wasn't able to reproduce the problem.\nPlease re-open if it happens in Nuclide version > 349.. actually there is some tests for this function: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-remote-projects/atom_tests/RemoteDirectorySearcher-test.js#L43-L52\nBut I think the issue here is a windows specific bug -- the path expansion is happening locally (so it's getting a Windows path) but the search is remote (so expects / separators). If the active node (i.e. selected DOM node) is in the file tree, then cmd-f opens find in project. That's implemented in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/d28fa2933206132c4ad691bee7cac535c46130ef/pkg/nuclide-file-tree/lib/registerCommands.js#L244-L247\nWhen you click file in file tree, the active element is still the file tree. Once you click a file, then cmd-f will search in buffer.. and the opened file isn't focused because you have pending panes enabled:\nsee https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/d28fa2933206132c4ad691bee7cac535c46130ef/pkg/nuclide-file-tree/lib/redux/Epics.js#L92-L99. Good to hear that works, the focus editor option has been in the settings for a while now -- I don't think its behavior changed recently.. @dilyin  you can click 'Ship it' in phabricator to commit this change, no need to make a pull request here. fixed in e981edc44f3c63ee5bd83df80f914ad38a20bcf4. The version with the fix is 0.368, I think that's not released yet.. merging into #1652. while we're at it, would you also be willing add terminal-specific font size and line height settings?. instead of adding a new call to setOption for fontFamily (which will conflict with the existing one that sync the Atom text editor setting), could you instead rename existing 'editor.fontFamily' to be FONT_FAMILY_CONFIG (line 136)?\nThen change syncAtomStyleItem (~line 400) to match the new terminal group (ideally you could also add options for the fontSize and lineHeight).. if (\n      // eslint-disable-next-line eqeqeq\n      (code === 0 || code === null) &&\n      !this._terminalInfo.remainOnCleanExit\n    ) {.

Unfortunately, BSD is not a supported platform for nuclide server.. @lorixx thanks for reporting!  I suspect that when you attached to the process, Nuclide was debugging native code rather than Javascript.\nBecause usage of the Javascript debugger was so low relative to support costs, Javascript debugger support was removed from Nuclide.  The picture you mention is a documentation bug.\nSorry I don't have a more helpful answer here.. @huogh if this is something that you can reproduce consistently, could you provide repro steps?

Nuclide's terminal does try to discover your default shell (as set by chsh on the target machine), but it is also possible to control explicitly. I just landed the documentation, so in case there is a delay in syncing to nuclide.io, here is the relevant section:\nCustom Shell\nBy default, Nuclide terminal starts a new shell by running /bin/bash --login -i.  You can customize this behavior by adding a file $HOME/.nuclide-terminal.json on the machine where the shell process runs.  Here is an example you can use on OSX to start the version of bash from MacPorts:\n{\n  \"command\": [\n    \"/opt/local/bin/bash\",\n    \"--login\",\n  ]\n}. ",

As new ones are added to the spec we'd add icons for those. A theme author could specify their own default using CSS and if they did not then they would get our default icon for the new ones until they update their theme.\nOnce LSP supports visibility, traits etc. we can just add them like this as \"trait-interface\" \"access-private\" etc. and further overlay icons etc.\n. Should I update the PR to make the changes to flow-type the list of current possible values for kind then?. Also do we want to call it something other than 'kind' on the css and/or outline view object given that there is already a 'kind' at the outline level for empty/loading etc..

Yeah I can rename those and rebase.. What's the state on this?  I thought it had got merged.... I'm not sure what restrictions your RPC stuff has. The one above is supposed to be from the list of atom$Octicons but is also defined as string as \"that type's not allowed over rpc\" - do you have any docs about the RPC process or steps I can test this with?. \n",
    "ljw1004": "Damien I'm not familiar with this codebase so I'm having a hard time following through. Would you mind writing out a concrete example of the HTML that will be produced? And then what would the theme do to skin it? (Also, is a theme able to introduce new icons? PNG or SVG? do themes do this already?)\nAlso, we're going to be asking LSP to add a new \"kind\" for Trait. In general, if LSP adds new kinds, what will existing icon themes be like?\nIncidentally, several people have approached me to say \"I want the same icons as IntelliJ\" and others to say \"I want the same icons as Eclipse, not IntelliJ\". So there's a definite wish to theme the icon-sets.\nThey also want, like Eclipse+IntelliJ, to use icon representation of more information - public/private/protected for sure. In VisualStudio those are represented by small mini-glyphs superimposed in the bottom right corner. Anyway, those thoughts are for the future, unrelated to this current PR.. Okay, so I guess if we did add a new kind called \"trait\", and a theme didn't yet provide an icon for that theme, then it would fall back on whatever in-the-box CSS style was present for \"kind-trait\", which would look out-of-place but at least would look like something. That's fine.. @ssandler Thanks for reporting. What you've describe is actually just a small tip of the iceberg where the connection between Hack and Nuclide is inadequate. I've spent the past six months rewriting all of this connection code (inside both the Hack project and the Nuclide project). The resulting work is currently in beta-testing with a small group of users, and I'm expecting it to go out in the 3.23 hhvm release (Nov17).\n\nThe new code has much better \"connection health monitoring\". If hh_server isn't responding to Nuclide for any reason, then it shows why.\nThe new connection code is based on the standard \"Language Server Protocol\". That theoretically makes it easy to also do Hack development from other clients as well (such as VSCode, and plain vanilla Atom without the Nuclide package) although I haven't yet got around to writing extensions for them to support this.\n\nSo sorry to say that I don't think it's worth pursuing this issue in the current legacy hack/nuclide.\nHow to unblock you? Hmm... I'm not actually sure. I'm kind of hoping you can live with this unacceptable behavior for a few weeks longer.... Thanks for the pointer. Actually we're going for a slightly different approach. The way Pranay's plugin works is when VSCode asks for something e.g. \"please show me hover at line 15 column 23\" then it invokes a command-line utility hh_client --type-at-pos 15:23.\nWhat we're doing is making hh_client lsp itself a native speaker of LSP. This means we have the ability to report stuff out-of-band (i.e. not solely in response to a request from VSCode). So for instance when hh_server stops, or is restarted, or is busy doing a typecheck, then the editor will show that straight away and can offer a \"[Restart]\" button when needed.\nIt also means that our LSP adapter has much easier access to the internals of hh_server. I'll be working to get Hack doc-comments into hover and autocomplete next month.. What I expect from other IDEs is that if there are these diagnostics\nwarning line20\nerror line26\nerror line15\nthen I can click on the Filename column header to sort by line number\nerror line15\nwarning line20\nerror line26\nand then I can click on the Type column header so it sorts first by type and then within that it leaves the previous sort-by-line-number:\nwarning line20\nerror line15\nerror line26\nBut in Nuclide, when I click the Type column header, then it discards the previous sort-by-line-number. It produces this:\nwarning line20\nerror line26\nerror line15\n. For what it's worth, Quip, Word, Excel and VS have the table-sorting memory I described. I didn't try any other table-presentation software.. Excel and Visual Studio indicate current sorting column with an arrow as you describe. I haven't yet tried IntelliJ or Eclipse. Word and Quip don't use a column, I guess because they're intended more for beautifully formatting an output document.. ",

It would be better to ship it in production. Lighter, for sure.. Something could be done here, I could avoid tuning the process.env.NODE_ENV as BufferedProcess can accept it's own set of ENV.

binaries for Node versions corresponding to Electron versions corresponding to Atom versions (Phew!) Currently Atom 1.23/1.24 correspond to Node 7.4.0, and Atom 1.25 corresponds to Node 7.9.0, both of which are covered by this package.\n\nIf you aren't using a supported version of node, the nuclide prebuilt libs may not contain useable binaries for you.. Knowing that something is in the works is very good to know! ESlint is sorely missed in these remote projects, maybe this is a good architecture question for the atom crowd.. I totally feel your pain. I closed the issue because ESlint is its own organization, it's ultimately up to them or create their own ide language server like Facebook has with flow. \nI don't know of a more universal solution that Nuclide could facilitate. Running any linter on the remote box and reporting back the results via atom UI doesn't feel very vender agnostic. ",

That doesn't seem to work - Nuclide disables the native tree view anyway.\nYou can get it to resolve the issue temporarily by enabling the native tree view, then switching to that tab, and then back again, for the same reason I presume that folding / unfolding the \"Folders\" region in the Nuclide tree works - it redraws that element and the styles are actually applied.. @hansonw Nice detective work there ; props to you for knowing how to fix it as well..

Hunting this down, it appears that getFlowVersionInformation() is ending up in the catch block with the error:\n\nProcessExitError: \"/Users/ericbiewener/dev/repo1/node_modules/.bin/flow\" failed with exit code 127\nenv: node: No such file or directory\n\nThis ultimately traces to somewhere in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/modules/nuclide-commons/process.js#L817. I haven't worked much with observables so digging in deeper than this would really take some time. For now I'm probably going to hack together a workaround..

The env: node: No such file or directory error suggests that node isn't being found, and I was able to recreate the issue in a custom Atom plugin with both child_process.spawn and child_process.exec..

Running it from an incorrect nodenv version will just error with a message telling you which versions contain the actual pkg. On macOS, the native which is in /usr/bin, which is after the nodenv shims in my PATH. So nuclide was using the shim, but from a nodenv version without the which pkg.

While implying I should build the project with buck, I've no idea how to do that. Could you please advise on this relative trivitality? I've simply built the project with make but this seems not enough as none of the nuclide features seem to be working for it.. Okay, I guess a project building with make cannot be fully used with nuclide, unless converted to a buck build.

Especially the last one feels obviously broken, as the command behaves differently based on where the definition you're jumping to lives. There doesn't seem to be an option to fix this behavior.

Have the docs been updated to describe how to connect the debugger to a running RN app on the emulator?. @pelmers that seems to work, sort of...\nHowever, on selecting 'Debug JS Remotely' on the Android emulator it automatically connects to the Chrome debugger. Maybe I need to override REACT_DEBUGGER with some value to force it to attach from Nuclide?\nEDIT: So instead of following the above, I selected Launch debugger on Nuclide and then added the workspace path along with Android. It then started the packager and looked like it succeeded until the following error appeared in the Nuclide console:\nStarting custom debugger by executing: echo A debugger is not needed:  \"~/Developer/rn-apps/test-rn-db\"\nreact_native\n21:35:48\n[Info] 11-28 21:35:35.323  5399  5399 D ReactNative: ReactInstanceManager.onReloadWithJSDebugger()\n11-28 21:35:35.324  5399  5399 D ReactNative: ReactInstanceManager.recreateReactContextInBackground()\n11-28 21:35:35.324  5399  5399 D ReactNative: ReactInstanceManager.runCreateReactContextOnNewThread()\nreact_native\n21:35:48\nDebugger worker loaded runtime on port 15920\nreact_native\n21:35:48\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token <\n    at createScript (vm.js:74:10)\n    at Object.runInThisContext (vm.js:116:10)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:537:28)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:584:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:507:32)\n    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:470:12)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:462:3)\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:609:10)\n    at startup (bootstrap_node.js:158:16)\n    at bootstrap_node.js:598:3\nIt then shows a blank screen on the emulator. .

    "semmypurewal": "@Ybrin, thanks for filing this issue! Unfortunately I think it is an issue with SourceKitten, not Nuclide. Can you file an issue through their project and see if they can help?. Yeah, @Empornium is correct. We stopped compiling away async/await in Node once it landed in Node 8. So updating to Node 8+ should resolve this issue.. I think this is resolved with 0.315.0. Please re-open if you're still seeing the issue.. Sorry you're having trouble! We're aware of this issue and have a fix for it. Unfortunately it won't be out until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest. In the meantime, try installing 0.310.0 which shouldn't have this problem.\n(This is a duplicate of #1547 and #1546.). Oh no! Can you tell me what you're setting as the 'Remote Server Command' in the connection dialog? I think it should be something like nuclide-start-server.. Oh ok! I can repro this now. It only happens when you try to add the PATH in the server command. I'm working on a fix and should have it ready by the next release. Sorry for the inconvenience!. @timzchang Can you set your path for node on the server instead of in the remote server command? The next release will come out early next week.. This is fixed in our master branch and will be rolled out next week with the release!. Oh cool! Hey @ryan953 it'd be awesome to sync up some time and hear how you and your team are using Nuclide with Docker! Feel free to reach out to me at my first name (semmy) at fb.com!. Ah, gotcha! Yeah, that's been something we've been thinking about. I was able to create a VM with the dependencies (including watchman) which was pretty straightforward, so a Docker container shouldn't be too much different. If we could do this, then I think we could more easily distribute development environments. It's something that I'm hoping we look into next half.. Hi @liaocs2008! Thanks for reporting this.\nCan you tell me which version of Nuclide you're using? From the stack trace it looks like a pretty old version. Specifically, in the latest version we should no longer be using the Python script to generate certificates.. Can you see if you still have this issue with the latest Nuclide?. When you updated the package on the server, how did you do it? It needs to be done globally:\nnpm install -g nuclide@0.341.0. Yeah, we definitely feel your pain. This is, in part, due to our stateful RPC framework.\nWe've talked a lot about approaches to making this work, but they all involve migrating away from our current approach to RPC. That's a long-term project, though, and won't be finished soon. :(. ",

Just a FYI; I got this error on a machine that did not have atom or apm cli tools installed. . I was very surprised at how much this is advertised as supporting PHP, but it really doesn't. And personally I don't think it should be advertised as being supported as none of the great functionality of nuclide actually works with PHP remote projects. It's a real shame as it's basically pointless if you work solely with PHP as you cannot get Outline, Symbols, Typechecking or anything. \n\ud83d\udc4d  for better PHP support. Or at the very least change the website so that it's not so misleading. Spent a lot of time trying to get this working. . Is this fixed in the latest release (0.345.0) ?. @captbaritone any reasoning behind this decision? IMO if you're offering any sort of file functionality copy and pasting seems pretty standard. . Really agree with this. \nAny minor change requires full uninstall and re-install on the server which is quite jarring when there's lots of developers using it.  I like to keep stuff up to date, but it requires all developers to update their IDEs all at the same time, and then not work for a few minutes while the server is uninstalled and re-installed. . Thanks @pelmers! Very useful response, this can be resolved by enabling the Focus editor on file selection option;\n\nI feel like this functionality has definitely changed as it's just something I noticed started happening with my normal workflow. I believe the default atom file-tree works as my original issue expected.\nHappy to close this if this isn't actually changed default functionality. . Strangely when Atom starts and this error occurs I get linked to this issue; https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/1439 \nThis is still a problem for me and my entire team in 0.360.0. ",

Is that desirable/okay for now?. > I hope we can get something more elegant in the longer term though.\nDefinitely, I am conviced this will not be an issue anymore once the RLS natively supports custom build systems.\nUpdate: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/53870 has been merged and the newest Rust nightly (2018-09-04) contains the RLS binary supporting external simple build systems (needed for this) out of box, as well as external Rustfmt.. @mostafaeweda @jsgf Rebased and pushed two changes: one being displaying busy indicator while the Buck builds the save-analysis build and the other one working around a Buck bug (https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/1606/commits/9f64faf40f56e04178c0af7feef7a298a3ae98bf), where outputs are relative to the cell, even when these are executed from the outer Buck root.\nDoes this still need more work or can we land it as the 1st increment?. @jsgf signed the CLA here, just in case.. This still requires explicit filtering for rust_* target kinds.. Done in https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/pull/1606/commits/8d4772f9ecda99b132d0f4b8eced16b9124455af. Forgot to remove the comment, sorry!. I understood that MultiLspLanguageService spawn separate LSP server per appropriate 'top-level' project config files like .hhconfig and that calling this seems like a good way to retrieve a handle to appropriate LSP server that's responsible for the fileUri we're building.\nHowever, I did assume there's going to be a single Buck root; I'll see if it works with multiple ones.. It depends; using cargo check as example, complete check build can even take a minute or two; rechecking the leaf only shouldn't take longer than a couple of seconds. Third party deps are vendored and pre-compiled from what I understand, so this should also further cut down compilation time. @jsgf would know more about how long exactly these #save-analysis builds take in the Buck environment.\nIt would certainly be good to report the progress - do you know if it's possible to pass a callback or report the progress gracefully using the Buck API here?. Changed this to display a busy spinner indicator while the save-analysis build executes.. @mostafaeweda sorry it took so long! Just tested this with multiple buck roots, using https://github.com/Xanewok/rust-buck-skeleton and building both //server:server and nested//:nested. This correctly retrieved the LSP server at root dir and nested/, respectively, so this looks good so far =). It seems that we can't avoid at least one call here:\n getRustBuildFile is called to work around Buck cell-relative output bug (tested this with @jsgf, it seems that buildfile query is unaffected and always returns output relative to current Buck root and not the cell)\n getRustFiles already checks if it's a Rust target but we also need to get a representative file for which we get the LSP service\n@mostafaeweda since the Buck cell bug will probably not be fixed quickly, do you think we can leave these 2 queries as it is, now?. @mostafaeweda my bad, I misunderstood what you were saying - I thought the gist was there being 2 calls and not checking before issuing them. Sorry! Will fix that in a moment.. Done here.. ",

    "w-hc": "Hi thank you so much for the help. Is it possible to change the font color as well? The referenced issue only discusses bg color.\nI tried \n.terminal-pane {\n  background-color: cornsilk;\n  color: red;\n}\nThe bg color does change, but the text color does not.\n--- update:\nI see if I change the theme to for example Atom Light, then both bg and text color change as specified. \nIt's only with Atom Materials UI theme that bg and text color are somehow enforced to be the same in terminal. \nAny thoughts on what their CSS did to make this happen?. I have enabled this terminal transparency option. But still things are not changed.\nMy syntax theme is Flatwhite. But I've tried other syntaxes and it goes the same. So I suspect it must be the UI.\n\nI've restarted Atom several times to make sure the settings are in effect.\n---- update\nok I noticed that my cursor color can be changed as according to \"color\". The command line remains transparent.. How curious.\nYou know that by default, ~/.atom/style.less is populated with a few dummy examples like \n```css\n// style the background color of the tree view\n.tree-view {\n  // background-color: whitesmoke;\n}\n// style the background and foreground colors on the atom-text-editor-element itself\natom-text-editor {\n  // color: white;\n  // background-color: hsl(180, 24%, 12%);\n}\n// style UI elements inside atom-text-editor\natom-text-editor .cursor {\n  // border-color: red;\n}\n```\nIf I comment them out completely, then everything is working.\n--- update\nActually no, it stopped working again whether I comment them out or not. I need to confirm.\n---update\nThis is much more sinister. If I only open 1 shell, it doesn't work, but once I open up another, then both shells are working. \nI can confirm that if I type commands in the blank shell, even though I cannot see the prompt display, the cursor does move downwards, and this means that the shell is indeed executing and not stuck.\n\n\nIn addition, if I open up console first, then open terminal, it works too. \n\nBasically that bar just needs to be there first. \nIf I open up terminal first (which is blank initially) and then open up console, and go back to the terminal, it works too. \nThe above happen regardless of whether I switch terminal transparency option on or off.. Hi, I think there is some relationship. \nI cannot reproduce the bug you reported. \nAfter poking around, now when I open new terminal, it opens up not as a new bottom pane, but as a new pane just like when I open up a new code pane. \n\nI do not know how this actually happened. I just drag them around trying to reproduce your bug.\nUnder this setup, the command line prompt is displayed correctly.\nThe trouble is I don't know how to go back. Even the console comes up as a new pane. I miss the bottom pop-up. hahah\n . ",

@pelmers Still occurs on my system; everything is up to date. seems like my less file still does not have the @accent-text-color definition.. Ah gotcha; i could not find the version number in that commit link. I appreciate the reply, and await the release. :). ",

    "hoxiea": "Uninstalling and reinstalling Atom and Nuclide didn't make in-editor typechecking feedback work. \nI also switched over to hhvm@3.27-lts in homebrew, thinking that an LTS release might be more stable/functional. That didn't work either.\nI also downloaded Ubuntu 18.04, ran it inside VirtualBox, and followed the official instructions to download and install Atom and HHVM - no real-time in-editor typechecking appeared there either, despite hh_client providing the correct typechecking feedback. \nI realize that this is a naive, fairly non-technical issue that I'm having. But the documentation just assumes that it'll work, with very little information about what to do if this feature (which seems to be a major selling point of hack) doesn't work. \nIs there some kind of log I can upload or diagnostic I can run to try to figure out where this is breaking down? I'm a longtime Vim user who's totally new to Atom/Nuclide, so unfortunately, I'm in the dark here. Any help would be appreciated.. ",
