    "lingoer": "Thanks!!!\nI just fixed it in the latest review.\n. Thank you so much!!!\nI'm still preparing the demo, I just don't know how to demonstrate it. \nAny suggestion?\n. add unit tests, yet not fully covered\n. Yes I do. But I'm still tracking the swift issue of pods here, waiting for a stable solution\n https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2218\n. That's a very nice idea!!!!\nThank you!!!\n. Well, in my opinion, it's better not...\nIt's true that collisions are not impossible, but using the same syntax with Swift may cause ambiguity, which is not good.\nAfter all , It's just a little one more character prefixed\n. Nice idea.\nIt did bothered me, too. \nIn one of the first commits it was a NSNumber, But, I Changed that later.\nBecause I don't want any NSThings come out from the value ------ The Cocoa things always comes with implicitly-unwrapped-optionals. Which I think , is not following the fundamental ideas of Swift language.\nIf there has a way simple and explicit as basic types yet functional as NSNumber, I'd be very happy to use that.\nI need a few time to think about it.\n. I give up.\nChosen NSNumber finally.\nAddition two methods provided\n. Interesting\n@garnett Shall we introduce some LiteralConvertible Protocol or some other init method?\n. Agreed! :) \nYesterday, I've replied a similar question in a Chinese forum with a similar answer to you.\nI think a class func parseFromString() is also needed\n. An ugly implementation would be String => NSData => NSJSONSerialization, ugly, but worked?\nAs for JInvalid :\ncase JNumber(Double)\n    case JString(String)\n    case JBool(Bool)\n    case JNull\n    case JArray(Array<JSONValue>)\n    case JObject(Dictionary<String,JSONValue>)\n    case JInvalid(NSError)\n. Ok, I'll commit the JInvalid thing later and think awhile for the init method. I want to keep NSData as the default init ,while provide some other init method for other types\n. Good, I'll add that later today. \nThanks\n. SwiftPods Not Yet.\nI think CocoaPods would support swift when the \"Beta\" gone\n. @andelf \u5e2e\u5fd9\u8865\u5145\u4e00\u4e0bReadMe\u5457~~~\u4e48\u4e48\u54d2~~\n. Well, I don't think so.\nIn my opinion, retrieving value with subscript is still in the context of JSON,when and only when the time you try to cast the real value out from JSON should then be an Optional.\nAdditionally it also makes it possible to trace the breaking point of the subscript chain.\n. I think it's duplicated with #4 \nWe will add to CocoaPods, but we are still waiting for the Swift Support in CocoaPods\n. Thanks!\n. You can use the .array property to cast a JSONValue in to an Array.\nAnd the .string property can cast a JSONValue in to String\nswift\nif let boardsArray = boardsJSON[\"boards\"]{\n  let countOfArray = boardsArray.count //Here you got your count\n}\n//If you are sure about the stability of your data struct, you can also use:\nfor board in boardsJSON[\"boards\"].array!{\n  let name = board[\"name\"].string!\n}\nHope this help.\n. The idea is good. \nBut maybe the use case is too limited?\n. Maybe we can make it an extension?\n. Swift Syntax changed in XCode Beta3, Please update your XCode\n. Please update your XCode to Beta3, Syntax changed\n. @Drogenix \nAny help would be welcomed\n. CocoaPods supports added.\nruby\npod \"SwiftyJSON\"\nNote that it requires your iOS deploy target >= 8.0\n. Thanks\n. Yes, you have to include the files manually.\n. Yes, because the cocoapods is using that type.\n. The dict[\"value\"].dictionaryValue do return a none optional value,\nIt's the second subscription:valueDict[\"display\"] that produce an optional value.\n\nyou should directly subscription like dict[\"value\"][\"display\"] to access the value wrapped in a JSON\n. Great job!\nSince XCode7 and Swift2 is still in beta I'm considering branching the repo to support Swift1 and 2 separately. What do you think?\n. Missed comment, we do return true at this situation. \n. https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/commit/5f5d00dbdcd256600a250765d9f674964080ceee\n. swift\nlet jsonString = Mapper().toJSONString(article!)\n// {\\\"price\\\":\\\"220.00\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Capricciosa\\\",\\\"active\\\":true,\\\"calculable\\\":true,\\\"id\\\":76,\\\"article_type\\\":2,\\\"ingredients\\\":[],\\\"critical_qty\\\":\\\"0.00\\\",\\\"barcode\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"tax\\\":\\\"1\\\"}\nlet jsonData = jsonString?.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)\nlet json = SwiftyJSON.JSON(jsonData)\n// i need here to get [String: AnyObject]\njson.dictionaryObject\n// here it is\n. the latest SwiftyJSON version is 2.3.1 and it seems you were using the 2.2.1 ?\n. Oh, yes! thank you!\n. Nice!!!\n. See the code in swift3 branch\n. Good job!\n. ",

Please merge so I can continue adding tests\n. I see your point here. Closing this one\n. Interesting use case! Why do you expect to achieve from this input, a dictionary, right?\nWhy don't you specify [a: b] (a dictionary) as an input?\n. I've thought about implementing literalConvertibles, but It's not the case where it will help. If we implement convertible, the call will look like:\nlet value : JSONValue = [1, :\"Foo\"]\nBy manually specifying the type, we allow to assign the value omitting the constructor (now it looks like let value = JSONValue([1, :\"Foo\"])\n. Ya, that was confusing to me, i'd recommend making a separate init that only takes NSData or allowing String input as well.\nGood point! @lingoer we should rethink public API and use cases of the library. Accepting both primitive types and NSData as well really looks confusing.\n\nMaybe, it will be better to make the following public api:\n- fromObject - converts json from NSJSONSerialization result\n- fromData - which internally uses NSJSONSerialization to get object representation.\nThis will allow us to keep these two use cases separated\n. As addition to previous comment: I personally do not like .JInvalid as return value.\nlet value = JSONValue(...)\nif value != .JInvalid {\n... some logic here\n}\nFor me, it looks more natural to return here something like fancy optional wrapper: http://swiftlytyping.tumblr.com/post/88210131086/error-handling\nIt can return both Error and JSONValue\n. @lingoer it will be really pain to implement, regexp all the things? I still do not see any real-world usage for this\n. I like JInvalid(NSError), let's keep this\n. Agree, this information is really necessary since Cocoapods are not yet supported.\nThe answer to your question is pretty simple:\n1. if you have swift project - drag-n-drop SwiftyJSON.swift to the project tree\n2. if you have mixed project it's probably better to include whole SwiftyJSON.xcodeproj as subproject\n. @bensarz I hope that Cocapods will support swift later (work in progress as I know)\nYou can add this repo as submodule and perform the steps I've described\n.

    "pvwoods": "Whenever a subscript object can not be guaranteed to exist, it would seem logical to cast it as an optional in order to avoid people assuming that it should exist.  This is an issue that JSON is specifically susceptible to since people will often treat elements of a JSON object as being required, when in reality, it can only be assumed that it will usually exist, though it is not guaranteed.\n. I believe that JArray works in the way most standard arrays do.  Specifically, I don't believe under this case you are guaranteed that at least one element exists and you would still need to check that the length of the JArray is greater than 0.\nTake this specific case:\n{ \n    \"myArray\" : [] \n}\n. This solution would actually break completely valid JSON.  The following would be an example:\njson\n{\n    \"thisIsValid\": \"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\n}\nDo you have an example of JSON you are using that cannot be parsed by SwiftyJSON?\n. Your second example is not a valid JSON string; It has been escaped. You need to un-escape it before passing it into SwiftyJSON.  IMO, there is no reason to make a change to the SwiftyJSON code base, as this is out of the scope of what SwiftyJSON does.\n. ",
    "mogocat": "I think that if the value exists, the code returns the value, if not, the code returns something about which subscript is nil.

The NSNull  Category which you post on stackoverflow in Objective-C is a masterpiece solution.\nThere are few way in SwiftyJSON to get NSNull object are var null: NSNull? and var object: AnyObject(better not use), other methods and properties that return the swift type in SwfityJSON are safe and reliable. such as: \n``` swift\nlet data: NSData = dataFromNetworking()\nlet json = JSON(data: data)\nif let mayBeNull = json.null {\n    //It's null\n} else {\n    //It's not null\n}\nif let string = json.string {\n     //It's String or NSString\n} {\n     //It's not String or NSString\n}\n// If json is .String return the object as String, \n// if json is.Number or .Bool convert the object to String\n// Otherwise return empty string\nlet iDontCare = json[\"iDontCare\"].stringValue \n```\nIt's seem like NSNull  Category.\nIf your have any idea, please let me know or submit a pull request. \nThanks.\n. https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/76\n.

Please try my fork, it may speedup you (pushed it several minutes ago): https://github.com/k06a/SwiftyJSON/tree/laziness\nIt should really speedup your code because of wrapping lazily only data which you is really using.\n. @ArifADS don't check \nif let jsonArray = json.array\nJust use this:\nfor subjson in json {\n    // ...\n}\n. This lazy keyword just evaluates your recursive construntor on first property access. It is not the same. I'll give you an example of laziness working.\n. @tangplin, this example of let json = JSON(object: raw) where raw is parsed object:\n[\n  {\n    ......\n    \"text\": \"just another test\",\n    ......\n    \"user\": {\n      \"name\": \"OAuth Dancer\",\n      \"favourites_count\": 7,\n      \"entities\": {\n        \"url\": {\n          \"urls\": [\n            {\n              \"expanded_url\": null,\n              \"url\": \"http://bit.ly/oauth-dancer\",\n              \"indices\": [\n                0,\n                26\n              ],\n              \"display_url\": null\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n      ......\n    },\n    \"in_reply_to_screen_name\": null,\n  },\n  ...\u2026\n]\nyour version of library parses whole hierarchy recursively to this:\n.Sequence([\n  .Mapping({\n    ......\n    \"text\": .ScalarString(\"just another test\"),\n    ......\n    \"user\": .Mapping({\n      \"name\": .ScalarString(\"OAuth Dancer\"),\n      \"favourites_count\": .ScalarNumber(7),\n      \"entities\": .Mapping({\n        \"url\": .Mapping({\n          \"urls\": .Sequence([\n            .Mapping({\n              \"expanded_url\": .Null(nil),\n              \"url\": .ScalarString(\"http://bit.ly/oauth-dancer\"),\n              \"indices\": .Sequence([\n                .ScalarNumber(0),\n                .ScalarNumber(26)\n              ]),\n              \"display_url\": .Null(nil)\n            })\n          ])\n        })\n      })\n      ......\n    }),\n    \"in_reply_to_screen_name\": .Null(nil),\n  }),\n  ...\u2026\n])\nbut my lazy implementation for let json = JSON(object: raw) just did this:\n.Sequence([\n  .PrivateRaw({\n    ......\n    \"text\": \"just another test\",\n    ......\n    \"user\": {\n      \"name\": \"OAuth Dancer\",\n      \"favourites_count\": 7,\n      \"entities\": {\n        \"url\": {\n          \"urls\": [\n            {\n              \"expanded_url\": null,\n              \"url\": \"http://bit.ly/oauth-dancer\",\n              \"indices\": [\n                0,\n                26\n              ],\n              \"display_url\": null\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n      ......\n    },\n    \"in_reply_to_screen_name\": null,\n  }),\n  ......\n])\nwhen anybody access json[0] it returns:\n.Mapping({\n  ......\n  \"text\": .PrivateRaw(\"just another test\"),\n  ......\n  \"user\": .PrivateRaw({\n    \"name\": \"OAuth Dancer\",\n    \"favourites_count\": 7,\n    \"entities\": {\n      \"url\": {\n        \"urls\": [\n          {\n            \"expanded_url\": null,\n            \"url\": \"http://bit.ly/oauth-dancer\",\n            \"indices\": [\n              0,\n              26\n            ],\n            \"display_url\": null\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    ......\n  }),\n  \"in_reply_to_screen_name\": .PrivateRaw(null),\n})\nand then accessing json[0][\"user\"] it returns:\n.Mapping({\n  \"name\": .PrivateRaw(\"OAuth Dancer\"),\n  \"favourites_count\": .PrivateRaw(7),\n  \"entities\": .PrivateRaw({\n    \"url\": {\n      \"urls\": [\n        {\n          \"expanded_url\": null,\n          \"url\": \"http://bit.ly/oauth-dancer\",\n          \"indices\": [\n            0,\n            26\n          ],\n          \"display_url\": null\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  })\n  ......\n})\nand then json[0][\"user\"][\"name\"] it returns:\n.ScalarString(\"OAuth Dancer\")\nSo it means only 10 enum wrappings instead of 17 wrappings.\nAnd only 3 calls of object as ClassName instead of 17 calls!\nMy lazy solution wraps objects to JSON enum only if necessary. It removes recursion in init(object:) method and in property var object. So this operations works faster.\n. You need to fully rewrap your edited object in JSON enum or propose another genius solution for editing SwiftyJSON :)\n. Try this fork: k06a/SwiftyJSON/tree/editing I think this functionality will be implemented in SwiftyJSON soon, method names and form of calls may be changed.\n. @yelled3 you can see example of usage in my PR: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/61\n. @yelled3 just added new syntax:\nlet json2 = json.updated((0,\"user\",\"name\"), newValue: JSON(object: \"Anton Bukov\"))\nIt is mush shorter and readable :)\n. Looks most native way to update a nested JSON. Are you using mutable collections inside JSON enum?\n. Full form of this code looks like this:\nlet json2 =\njson.updated(0) { j1 in\n    j1.updated(\"user\") { j2 in\n        j2.updated(\"name\") { j3 in\n            JSON(object: j3.stringValue + \"Denis\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nshortest version can be single lined:\nlet json2 = json.upd(0) { $0.upd(\"user\") { $0.upd(\"name\") { JSON(object: $0.stringValue + \" Bukov\") } } }\n. func update is implemented near subscripts because my first try looks like this via subscript interface:\nlet json2 =\njson.updated[0, {\n    $0.updated[\"user\", {\n        $0.updated[\"name\", {\n            JSON(object: $0.stringValue + \" Bukov\")\n        }]\n    }]\n}]\nBut Swift's xxx[a, {...}] can not be shortened to xxx[a] {...} :(\n. At least mark this PR as discuss to talk about nicing update syntax\n. I wanna achieve this syntax:\njson[0,\"user\",\"name\"] = \"Den\"\nor at least this:\njson[(0,\"user\",\"name\")] = \"Den\"\ntuple can be enumerated like this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/24831640/440168?stw=2\n. Oh just did this:\nlet json2 = json.updated((0,\"user\",\"name\"), newValue: JSON(object: \"Anton Bukov\"))\nTha main problem is class subscript can not be templated like this:\npublic subscript<T>(arr: Array<T>)\nor like this:\npublic subscript<T>(tuple: T)\n. This can be achieved with this code:\nvar err: NSError?\nlet data = NSJSONSerialization.dataWithJSONObject(json.object!, options: nil, error: &err)\n. What wrapper do you mean?\n. You're using them wrong. What you want is .description and .debugDescription\n. If you need to serialize json object to data it can be achieved like this: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/62\n. ",

This is also occurring in cococoapods 0.39 b4\n. This seems to be a bad interaction between upgrading Xcode and Cocoapods.\nIt can be cleared up by wiping Xcode's derived data for your project and then running 'pod install' again.\n. I've updated the original post with actual JSON data I'm having issues with.\n. I'm facing the same issue\n. https://github.com/appsailor/SwiftyJSON/tree/swift3 is working fine with carthage and swift 3\n. https://github.com/appsailor/SwiftyJSON/tree/swift3 works fine too\n. Still getting the errors\n. Oh it didn't upgrade to SwiftyJSON 3.0.0 by itself... Fixed it now :)\n. It appears you're trying to pull user/profile images of users from an unspecified source/array. Could you elaborate what it is exactly you're trying to do?. Hi, \nSame here. Parsing otherwise valid JSON fails in some cases. I have, in my opinion, quite a big JSON array (70k items). I'm getting it compressed from the server (in gzip). After that I'm passing the decompressed data to SwiftyJSON  constructor init(data: Data, options opt: JSONSerialization.ReadingOptions = .allowFragments, error: NSErrorPointer = nil).  I'm passing the same json data, but sometimes this line JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: opt) throws: \n\nError Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3840 \"Unable to convert data to string around character 1944859.\"\n\nIn respect of the above issue I'd like to suggest something. Initially I used SwiftyJSON constructor like this let json = JSON(data: decompressedData), and then my check was for a .null  JSON. What I expected is if the JSON is .null, to have the error for that set in  SwiftyJSON  error property, but it's not set even if JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: opt) throws an exception. Then I had to switch tolet json = JSON(data: decompressedData, options: [], error: &error) in order to obtain the error. It seems kinda inconsistent to use another error object only for the constructor when working with SwiftyJSON. Could you please, add one line in constructor that will copy the exception error to your property. . I found a way to fix my issue. Still I think that the error, that may arise in the constructor, should be stored to the local property.. ",

Hi @jansabbe, I just had the same problem and opened an issue for that (https://github.com/lingoer/SwiftyJSON/issues/42).\nBut I like the approach more to connect SwiftyJSON to all targets where it is going to be used and only to make the JSONValue object public to be able to use JSONValue objects as part of public method APIs in frameworks. I've created an own pull request (https://github.com/lingoer/SwiftyJSON/pull/43) with the corresponding implementation. What do you think? Does that work for you as well?\n. Okay, I see that and agree with your perspective. Adding as a framework and git submodule seems to be the most useful and clean usage pattern. I hope this will become the standard for Swift iOS frameworks. ;)\n. I just tried to use your framework branch and added it as a git submodule + added the whole XCode Project to my Project file (like I already did with Alamofire) but I get the Could not build Objective-C module 'SwiftyJSON' error when I try to import SwiftyJSON. What am I doing wrong?\n. I've made JSONValue public and created a pull request for it (https://github.com/lingoer/SwiftyJSON/pull/43). Hope this solves it for everyone who's also interested in using SwiftyJSON as part of public framework APIs.\n. OK, my solution might not be the right one as I receive 'JSONValue' is not convertible to 'JSONValue' when trying to use the method with JSONValue parameter. Anyone know if this issue derives from a different source?\n. This solution is not working, see https://github.com/lingoer/SwiftyJSON/issues/42#issuecomment-53590344. Check out @jansabbe's pull request instead: https://github.com/lingoer/SwiftyJSON/pull/41.\n.

If I can do that, I can just add a library by using git submodules. Any updates I can just pull without worrying about conflicts.\n. There might be some extra information in the compile-logs.

The backslashes infest the string in the string fetched by our iOS App HttpRequest.  The reason: .Net actually sends the string in that format, but is parsed when the browser displays it to the user. But only by the Decoder the Backslashes are literally still there but interpreted.\nNow the first two double quotes you wonder why they are there, maybe. The thing is since its a string coming from the web apparently it add those quotes by itself on Xcode without the backslash. However they still pose a problem to the \"Invalid Json Format\" error that Xcode will haunt you about.\nSo yeah maybe in your situation is wouldn't work. Buy your scenario is very specific. Mine it can be common if you are trying to fetch data from a Microsoft Sql Database to display it on your iOS app.\n. the second example is on purpose escaped. \nit is an invalid Json Format, it is how the HttpRequest NSdData gets the json in Xcode. \nI believe you are right about the scope. I was thinking of a possible fix addition to the SourceCode because is a code that seems not to hurt and possible solution for a spectrum of Developers that are having hard time using SwiftyJson is a good library addition I must say.\nBut anyways if the Coder Owner wants to leave this few lines of code to aid others with the same issue.\n. Sure. \nI'll do a pull to suggest a solution and test it well myself before submitting it.

I remember I had to fix a small syntax issue which I really didn't understand why, I can't remember what exactly was but it was not complicated 15 mins top to fix it. \n. hmm thats wierd. I didnt have to add anything about the alamofire. And nothing about adding Link binary. I just added SwiftyJson and some other one like if both files were '.swift files' created by me. tomorrow that I get at the office and see my project Ill check and get back here. \n. i solved it the same way, by just adding to my project the two source code files SwiftyJson and something else I can't remember.

It was great working with you.. I actually don't know of a specific example, but I guess, if the user has a very big JSON it is a good idea to have this method for performance reasons.. I wouldn't necessary treat that as an error, since the main identifier in a JSON is the key, but I see how this could lead to bugs and confusion. \nBut on the other hand some applications doesn't want to have their JSONs strictly typed and what to change the types to change dynamically.. Totally!. > My point is that we should always make sure that errors are propagated back to the client and that we corrupt data without one of those errors.\nIn my opinion it is not an error, but a proper use case of this merging function. And by prohibiting merging two key-value-pairs that are of different types, we would rob users of this possibility. \nI love the idea of python, which is \"we're all consenting adults here\". Programmers mostly know what they are doing, and if there is overriding is happening because of type mismatch it is either on purpose or it is not SwiftyJSON's tasks to prohibit that by cutting functionality. \n\nIf someone did want to replace the entire JSON when merging with conflicting types, they could simply do:\n\nThis is not the same as what is happening in my implementation.

Also can you provide a sample of you json response?\n. JSON Parsing in SwiftyJSON are actually done by NSJSONSerialization.\nAnd NSJSONSerialization supports\n\nThe data must be in one of the 5 supported encodings listed in the JSON specification: UTF-8, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32LE, UTF-32BE. The data may or may not have a BOM. The most efficient encoding to use for parsing is UTF-8, so if you have a choice in encoding the data passed to this method, use UTF-8. \n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSJSONSerialization_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSJSONSerialization/JSONObjectWithData:options:error:\n. This part is actually handled by system NSJSONSerialziation class, seems like currently it doesn't actually support number with e format\n. Since it's not in the http://www.json.org/ standard. And IMHO, it's should be part of JSON Parser's job, instead SwiftyJSON.\n. It's should be working with the latest version now.\n:beers: \n. This issue should have been resolved.\nIf you're using Xcode7, please use version 2.3.0 and up\nIf you're using Xcode6, please stay on version 2.2.1\n. I don't think SwiftyJSON is creating nested dictionaries\nswift\nvar json: JSON = [:]\njson[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] = \"1.2\"\nprint(json)\nOutput\n```\n{\n}\n```\nFor now, you'd have to do\nswift\nvar json: JSON = [:]\njson[\"a\"] = [:]\njson[\"a\", \"b\"] = [:]\njson[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] = \"1.2\"\n. Just did a fix and make the operator overload internal to SwiftyJSON. It shouldn't affecting anything outside the framework anymore.\n. Can you paste in the code of how you're getting this date value?\n. Feel free to reopen this if you have any more questions.\n. Which version of SwiftyJSON are you using?\nIf you're using Xcode6.4 for Swift1.2, please use version 2.2.1 or below\n. It's tagged, and released to cocoapods\n:beers: \n.

Can you show a bit of code rather than just the json data. :)\n. Oddly, this code is actually working fine here\n\n. Also since JSON is a struct, try preventing copying\n``` swift\nvar json:JSON = [:]\nvar jsonCopy:JSON = json\njson[\"aaaa\"].intValue = 999\nprint(json[\"aaaa\"].intValue) // 999\nprint(jsonCopy[\"aaaa\"].intValue) //0\n```\nFeel free to reopen this issue of you've further questions\n. merged into master, tag 2.3.0 has been published to CocoaPods\n:beers: \n. I'm guessing you only needs to do\nswift\nself.storyInfo = response[\"data\"][\"story\"].string // if it's a string\n. Are you using Xcode7 for this?\nIf so, please upgrade to 2.3.0 version or up\n. Cool, please use version 2.3.0 or up for Xcode7 support\n. It's merged, watchOS2 should be working properly.\nFeel free to reopen this issue if there are any more issues.\n:smile: \n. \nClick the plus in your workspace\nIt's that easy.. :smile: \nBut remember, you have to build the target first before you can import it in the playground\n. try with tag 2.2.0, if it's in CocoaPods do it like this:\nruby\npod 'SwiftyJSON', '~> 2.2.0'\nor\nruby\npod 'SwiftyJSON', :git => 'https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON.git', :tag => '2.2.0'\n. This actually not quiet related to SwiftyJSON, can you specify which platform and which version is it crashing on.\nBecause it's actually printing 0 on my Mac.\nAlso, can you simply try\nswift\nlet print = \"% o\"\nNSLog(\"Trying to log bad json will crash: \\(print)\")\nAnd see if it causes the same crash there.\n. Also you can try this:\nswift\nlet jsonString = \"{\\\"crash\\\":\\\"% o\\\"}\"\nif let data = jsonString.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding) {\n    let json = JSON(data: data)\n    NSLog(\"%@\", \"Trying to log bad json will crash: \\(json)\")\n}\n. Seems like it's the same issue with https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/351\nUse this\nAlamofire.request(.POST, baseUrl, parameters: parameters)\n        .responseJSON { _, _, result in\n            print(result)\n            let json = JSON(data: result.value)\n    }\n. I'm not quiet sure what exactly is the issue here.\nCan you explain a little bit more?\n. Feel free to reopen this issue if needed\n. Well, I don't think there is any way other than this.\nIf you think it's too ugly maybe you can try this:\nswift\njsonString.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)\n    .flatMap({JSON(data: $0).dictionaryObject})\nNot sure if it helps\n. It feel to me this method is really confusing to people, and also myself.\nAnd it's not add enough value for us to clarify and document this method.\nAlso every team might have different definition of empty, so maybe this should not be part of the SwiftyJSON, but rather a simple extension on the actual product code.\n. Can you also provide Carthage version?\n. \nTry this new version\n. Please let me know if this helped\n. It's was actually because NSJSONSerialization doesn't accept this encoding. \nswift\nlet string = \"{\\\"A\\\":\\\"A\\\",\\\"C\\\":{\\\"D\\\":\\\"\u5357\\\"}}\"\nif let dataFromString = string.dataUsingEncoding( CFStringConvertEncodingToNSStringEncoding(CFStringEncoding(CFStringEncodings.GB_18030_2000.rawValue)), allowLossyConversion: false) {\n    try! NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(dataFromString, options: [])\n}\nThis code was crashing as well.\nI'm not sure if you have a particular reason to use this encoding, but try use NSUTF8StringEncoding\nswift\nlet string = \"{\\\"A\\\":\\\"A\\\",\\\"C\\\":{\\\"D\\\":\\\"\u5357\\\"}}\"\nif let dataFromString = string.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding) {\n    let json = JSON(data: dataFromString)\n}\n. I'm guessing you have to this\nlet idNumber = j[J.ChannelId.rawValue].number ?? j[J.Id.rawValue].number ?? NSNumber(int: 0)\n. This?\n```\nstruct J {\n    static let Id = \"id\"\n    static let ChannelId = \"channel_id\"\n}\nlet idNumber = j[J.ChannelId].number ?? j[J.Id].number ?? NSNumber(int: 0)\n```\n. Pull Request has been merged.\nYou can try it out now in master branch.\n. Sorry about deleting the trailing spaces.\nI can revert them if it's too much trouble.\n:)\n. What do you wanna out of jsonObj.stringValue?\nBut I'm guessing you want something this?\nswift\nprint(jsonObj[0][\"lastName\"].stringValue)\n. You're looking for rawString\n``` swift\nlet keys = [\"firstName\", \"lastName\", \"age\",\"carNumber\", \"licenseNumber\", \"email\",\"password\", \"msgType\"]\nlet objects = [\"Pencil\", \"Eraser\", \"2332\",\"534543\", \"543543\", \"Notebook\",\"Pencil\", \"ADD_DRIVER\"]\nlet dictionary = NSDictionary(objects: objects, forKeys: keys)\nvar data = Dictionary\ndata.append(dictionary as! Dictionary);\nvar jsonObj = JSON(data)\nprint(jsonObj.rawString())\n``\n. Have you tryclean build folder` and build again?\nIf so, it's also possible that you're not embedding the frameworks in your app. \nAre you using CocoaPods or Carthage?\n. IMHO\nIf we don't escape \\n then the string becomes\njson\n[{\n  \"uid\": \"a8dc9967-5abd-475a-96a7-ce77ee9b4480\",\n  \"id\": \"edbba732-27da-4dba-96b0-e9478577eca7\",\n  \"name\": \"hello\",\n  \"mem_name\": \"\",\n  \"touser\": \"\",\n  \"content\": \"[asdsadf]\n  [asdfasdf]\",\n  \"min\": 6\n}]\nWhich is corrupted...\nJSON parsing in SwiftyJSON is actually delegated to iOS's NSJSONSerialization which is where this parse is failing.\nAlso you can escape it simply by wrapping it with another \\. like \\\\n\n. :+1: \n:beers: \n. Just fixed in master.\nThx for pointing it out.\n:beers: \n.

Cool, feel free to reopen this if needed.\n. You're looking for parse \nhttps://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/blob/master/Source/SwiftyJSON.swift#L86\nThe string literal conversion was meant to be used within JSON object.\nlike this:\nvar jsonResult = JSON.parse(\"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"0402\\\",\\\"message\\\":\\\"\u8bf7\u5148\u83b7\u53d6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\\\"}\")\nlet test:JSON = \"\u8bf7\u5148\u83b7\u53d6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u78012\"\njsonResult[\"code\"] = test\njsonResult[\"code\"]\nCheers.\n:beers: \n. Do you mean cache?\n. Nice work.\nOne concern that I have is that this might break other ppl's existing app.\nAlso, how would you differentiate index 0 and string \"0\"?\nAlso, apologize for not getting to this PR earlier.\n. Hm, for instance, if someone out there is using . in their json key. (I know it's not quiet possible)\nLike:\n{\"com.apple.app1\":\"fadbifdoafboadbfojabdfoajbfhauebbfuuryrwowrgk\"}\nThen this pr will cause their code to fail, and their is no way for them to easily fix it.\nGranted, same thing happens for valueForKeyPath, still a bit of concern from my point of view.\nWhat do you think? \n. Feel free to reopen this if needed.\nCheers\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Seems like you're create a new folder for this example, and copying the source code?\nHow about doing it in the Example folder we already have and create a new PR?\nI'll close this one for now, but feel free to reopen this if you'd like to discuss more.\nCheers\n. Agreed, I think we need to rethink our error handling model.\nBecause most of the code for this library was written back in Swift1, it's definitely need a rewrite and take advantage of the new Swift features.. @ldiqual  I think that's a good idea, we should document the crap out of it this time. \ud83d\ude04  . I believe isEmpty was dropped a bit before, during Swift3 migration.\nThis PR might be outdated. Feel free to reopen this if needed.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. hm, to me, JSON feels like a data, value type.\nYou should use it just like number or string or array.\nIMHO, The way to use it in test, is not to extend it to be able to stub or mock.\nBut rather just create one.\nAnd set the expected value in there, and just use it like a normal JSON.\nGonna go ahead and close this PR, but feel free to reopen this if you'd like to discuss more.\nCheers\n.

Sorry for the late reply.\nCan you maybe add a bit of testing to it and let's merge this PR. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Nice example,\nThanks for proposing this.\nSo from my understanding,\nThe problem here, is TitleResponse and maybe OtherResponse not reusing code from each other, right?\nThe solution is to have a generate Response<T>, and T in this particular case means something that can be converted from JSON.\nIMHO, from the aspect of abstracting. Your abstraction is perfect. Having a JSONSerializable and constrained type T.\nBut if we were abstracting it all the way to the library level.\n1. It might cause mental overhead for other people that doesn't know what its for.\n2. In order to move it to the library, we have to make it very generic. like why is the init failable, if it's failable then should we do error reporting, or at least being able to. In the end, it might be to generic to be used in this particular use case.\nAnyway, let me know what do you think. \ud83d\ude04 \n. hah hah,\nThat's exactly my point.\nWhich is for something to be in the library, it will have a lot more to consider.\nLike failable init or throw, failable works in your case, but throw can do error reporting and tell you exactly what went wrong. Or even something like Argo.\nMaybe I wasn't being clear enough. \ud83d\ude04 \nWhat I'm trying to say is, JSONSerializable is a perfect abstraction on response<T> level which close to the final concrete product: response<Title> or response<Other>.\nBut if we move it into the repo, then the level might be too high. For the two reason I listed.\nApologize if I sound really picky or unreasonable.\nLet me know what you think. \ud83d\ude04 \n.

So for literal conversion, we assume that the object on the right is a plain object.\nThis one would work:\n``` swift\nlet subJson = JSON([\"foo\": 1])\nlet json = JSON([\"bar\": subJson])\nlet description = json.debugDescription // this is {\"bar\":{\"foo\":1}} as excepted\nlet litJson: JSON = [\"bar\": [\"foo\": 1]]\nlet litDescription = litJson.debugDescription // this is unknown\n```\nStill You're right, we should address this inconsistency.\n. I think this PR address this issue.\nFeel free to open this if needed.\n\ud83c\udf7b \n. hm, not sure if I follows.\nIs this what you're looking for?\n\nUnless your intention is to convert Optional.None into null.\nIf that's the case, IMHO, I think they are a bit different, like Optional.None aka nil means this thing doesn't exist.\nWhere as null mean this thing (or key) exist, but the value is null.\nSo if the api is asking you to send null for empty fields, maybe we can map nil it to NSNull.\nBut doing it in the framework level seems a bit to specific.\nWhat do you think? \ud83d\ude04 \n. Thanks for the quick reply,\nIn you example, type [String: Any?] is not quiet the same as [String: Any].\nIMHO, JSON dictionary is a type [String: JSON] or in this case [String: Any].\nOptional type is swift only. You can't find 1 to 1 mapping in JSON that represent Optional.\nThen with your example.\nvar json:[String: Any] = [\"hello\":\"world\"]\nsetting something to nil.\njson[\"sup\"] = nil remove the sup key if exist, and does nothing if it doesn't.\nsetting it to NSNull\njson[\"sup\"] = NSNull() would actually create a key with sup and set its value to NSNull.\nHope I'm making sense here.\n\ud83d\ude04 \n. sorry, I didnt close this on purpose, we cleaning the swift3 branch since we no long need it.\n. Can you try pointing this to master branch?\n. I'd definitely prefer to having a separate method or option doing this.\nNot sure if you can extend  JSONSerialization.WritingOptions though.\n. hey mate, sorry for the late reply.\nTry a couple times solve the conflict and merge this PR, but seems like I'm can't push to you repo.\nbash\nkylefang:SwiftyJSON/ (PR-610) $ gp gsabran PR-610:swift3                                                                                                                [0:32:59]\nCounting objects: 299, done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (294/294), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (299/299), 57.89 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.\nTotal 299 (delta 174), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (174/174), completed with 14 local objects.\nTo https://github.com/gsabran/SwiftyJSON.git\n !

A framework like this one cannot afford (IMHO) to gloss over this and assume all users want \"no value\" to be mapped into \"0\" (or similar).\nThat said, after fussing with nil for weeks, I threw in the towel and created the NSNull category above, which gives you exactly what you want - two cases.

Maybe this will help someone in the future. \nI'm using SwiftyJson through CocoaPods. \nHere's my code: \nswift\nHttpClientManager.get(url,\n      headParameters: headParams,\n      success: { (responseData: JSON) -> Void in\n         //If I comment the next line, I get the seg fault 11\n         SwiftEventBus.post(Constants.Events.LOGIN_SUCCESS, sender: responseData[\"someField\"].string)\n      }, failure: { (error: String) -> Void in\n         //if I comment the next line, I get the seg fault 11\n         SwiftEventBus.post(Constants.Events.LOGIN_FAILURE, sender: error)\n      })\nIf I never use the closure variable (responseData in success and error in failure) then I get the segmentation fault 11.\nI wasn't calling them because I was just printing strings to see if the behaviour was working. I had another file with the same structure working and copy pasted the whole content and started removing code until I figured it out. So, if I don't want to care about the closure variable, I'll just use \"_\" instead to avoid this mess... \n. @michaldudek I'm glad I could help someone. :) \nToday was another fight with xcode for no reason was keeping indexing files indefinitely and I lost sintax highlighting. Had to uninstall and reinstall xcode to make it back to work. I guess we won't ever stop blaming xcode for something. \n. I'm using the xcode6.3 branch and haven't noticed anything different.

I'm not too sure which example you're referring to, are you talking about the playground code maybe?

But maybe you're thinking about something else, let me know.\n. @refried Bump.. @refried Oh wow, yes it's a super old issue, I thought it was from January of this year. Given that you can just use Enum(rawValue: json[\"foo\"].stringValue) and json[\"foo\"].stringValue = enum.rawValue I'm not sure I see the value of such a feature.

PR in review https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/731. @zhigang1992 I believe you added this in https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/406 to parse json strings as opposed to initialize with a string value like JSON(\"hello\") which does accept invalid json strings. Since JSON.parse is undocumented already, how would you feel about having init(jsonString: String) throws instead? It would avoid the init(object: ) confusion by making it clear you need a valid json string there. We would also throw if the data is invalid. Let me know..

Please let us know it you'd like to reopen it.\n. @zhigang1992 Looking at the code, it seems that we're gonna end up with a confusing API. For instance, to unpack a string you have\n\njson.string -> String?\njson.stringValue -> String with a fallback on \"\" if not found, potentially error prone\njson.requiredString throws -> String which throws if the value is incorrect.\n\nI would argue that we should be as strict as possible and leave the responsibility on the user to fallback on whatever is best if the value cannot be unpacked. This is why I'm proposing this unique interface:\n\njson.string() throws -> String\n\nIt covers all the cases above:\n\ntry? json.string()\ntry? json.string() ?? \"\"\ntry json.string()\n\nIt also has the value to provide an explicit error if the unpack fail, as opposed to returning nil or a \"fake\" value. Imho it'll lead to more robustness in codebases.\nHowever it does introduce a code-breaking change, probably worth a SwiftyJSON v4 or something. What do you think?.

Let me know if we need to reopen!. @simonnarang Thanks for opening an issue! I believe you want to iterate over the reponse2.data array by using a for in. I think what you need to do is to use json.arrayValue or json.array and iterate on that. Something like\nfor menuGroup in groupsJson.arrayValue {\n    let name = menuGroup[\"name\"] as! String\n}\nFor the sake of safety, I would actually add more safeguards:\nguard let menuGroups = groupsJson.array else {\n    fail()\n}\nfor group in menuGroups {\n    guard let name = menuGroup[\"name\"].string, let image = menuGroup[\"image\"].string, let guid = menuGroup[\"guid\"].string else {\n        continue\n    }\n    // append\n}\nbecause arrayValue has an implicit fallback on [] and as! String may lead to crashes, especially with flexible structures like JSON.\nLet me know if it solves your issue.. @jaymutzafi At first sight your example should definitely work. Can you share a sample project?. @LastSoul @merktassel @selaysoysal @lucasderraugh Sorry for the delay on this. Can each one of you post the actual JSON data that you're parsing? Not just the dictionary representation but the full json data. Here's what I'm thinking so far:\n\n@LastSoul I ran your code and the JSON parses correctly, I don't get nil. Are you on the latest version of SwiftyJSON and if not, would you mind trying again with the latest version?\n@selaysoysal Would you mind posting the JSON data you're trying to parse? Will make it easier to investigate\n@merktassel @lucasderraugh I believe both of you are accessing id with the incorrect type. In one case, you're using .string instead of .int, and in another case it's the opposite. It would be easily confirmed if you could post the actual data that you're parsing. Let me know\n\nThanks!.

In theory it shouldn't be too hard to implement, it'd just make one test case a tad slow. What do you think?. PR in https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/708. @devM4x Bump. @AmitBhavsarIphone I would argue that it's not the role of SwiftyJSON to map JSON to models. SwiftyJSON's role is to allow manipulating json data flexibly, but not map it onto an object. There are a ton of other libraries whose role is to do this, on top of my head: Unbox, ObjectMapper, Mapper, etc. Those are fully unit tested and are doing a much better job at this than what SwiftyJSON would provide.\nI'm going to close this as a wontfix, let me know if you'd like to reopen.. I think it'd be a very interesting feature for SwiftyJSON that would allow it to differentiate itself from competitors. I'm gonna tag this as help wanted in case someone would like to work on this, please let us know in this issue so we can assign you.. @sujaykakkad Awesome! Assigning you here then. Would you mind discussing the architecture in this issue before creating a PR? Just so we're on the same page. Thanks!. @sujaykakkad Are you talking about https://cocoapods.org/pods/JSONSchema, or are you planning to write JSONSchema yourself?. @papertigers @wongzigii Is there anything we can do at the SwiftyJSON level to fix this issue? Or is it using --no-use-binaries an appropriate workaround, which would make this issue resolved?. @wongzigii Thanks for elaborating on this! It seems that it's a Carthage issue and not related to SwiftyJSON so I'm gonna go ahead and close this. Let me know if you need to reopen. Thanks!. @mokagio Bump. Can you give more context on the changes of your PR and why it creates warnings in 8.1? Thank you!. @ftgithub Would you mind clarifying what you're trying to extract? Also, please post the json string that you're trying to parse, this seems like a dictionary that was printed in the console, not a valid json.\n. @ftgithub Bump.. @ftgithub In order to keep our issue backlog clean, and given the absence of followup, I'm gonna go ahead and close this. Please feel free to ping us if you'd like to reopen. Thank you!. @zoufishanmehdi I believe your issue was addressed so I'm gonna go ahead and close this. Let me know if you need to reopen. Thanks!. json[\"data\"] returns a value of type JSON which is a non optional, you can't use it in an if let unwrapping pattern. I would remove the if check altogether.\n. Looks like your issue is addressed, closing now. Thanks!. @danielkiedrowski Awesome!  Thank you so much for contributing to SwiftyJSON, this is a great feature. Merging now.. @chaiyanpu Thanks a lot for your contribution! I've used part of your modifications in https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/729 and made sure tests also build without warnings. Most importantly, I avoided using force unwraps so that nothing leads to crashes. Closing this in favor of https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/729, thanks again!. @victorlin Thanks a lot for your contribution! Merging. @cwkatzmann Thanks a lot for your contribution! Merging. @wongzigii Restarted the build and tests passed correctly. Can you review this PR as well, I'll take which ever \ud83d\udc4d comes first :P. Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/716. This is a carthage issue, unrelated to SwiftyJSON. Thanks!. @wongzigii Are we good on this PR?. @wongzigii Great suggestion. Updated the CHANGELOG.. @zhigang1992 Bump. @strangeliu If I understand this properly, this adds the ability to convert \"1\" and \"0\" to the corresponding booleans, with \"-1\" having some kind of undefined behavior (whatever NSDecimalNumber decides it is).\nI'm personally in favor of moving away from any wobbly conversion like \"true\" => true or 1 => true because they can introduce unexpected bugs \u2013 I'd rather go with strict typing or return nil that the client would handle whichever way is best for their usecase. This is something we're actively discussing internally, so please hang in there until we decide of an outcome. We'll let you know asap. Thanks!. @gmoledina There is no reason to prevent 3.0 compilers from running the latest master as there is no code breaking change. I could be convinced if there actually were new language features that we'd ship along with the change, but as it is, this PR only adds a major inconvenience for no benefit whatsoever. You can compile with 3.0.1 if you want, and you can compile with 3.0.0 if you'd like too, but we're not going to force you either way.\nI'm gonna go ahead and close this. Thanks a lot for contributing to SwiftyJSON, let me know if you'd like to reopen.. @JeffGuKang Neat! Would you mind discarding your changes in contents.xcplayground and contents.xcworkspacedata? Thank you!. @JeffGuKang Still shows up in the diff: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/739/files#diff-baa084bbb5cafa8d9e3a530988a38ca4. @JeffGuKang We should probably fix this as part of a PR that is more related to it, like the Xcode 8.2 upgrade or something like that. It's more about keeping the history clean and avoiding conflicts, I don't mind too much about the change itself but it can be misleading for git blaming.. @flybrotherlixiang Thanks for your contribution! Would you mind elaborating on what this fixes?. @mitchellporter Thanks for opening an issue! The proper constructor to create a JSON instance with Data is JSON(data: Data). JSON(_ object: Any) is to create a JSON value, so it needs to be a JSON-compatible type (Data isn't a compatible type). There is a pull request open to avoid the confusion here: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/664. I'll close this when the PR gets merged. Thanks again!. This strikes me as dangerous, because if you have a.merge(b) with a being a dict and b being an array, you're basically replacing a with b with no error or warning. I would suggest making the function throw an appropriate error indicating the type mismatching.. I can't think of a usecase where you'd like to mutate a JSON value instead of returning another value. Do you have an example in mind?. merged(with: JSON) reads a bit better I think. Can you clarify what you mean by\n\nI wouldn't necessary treat that as an error, since the main identifier in a JSON is the key\n\nI think SwiftyJSON's goal is to be as safe as possible, which is why there is no force unwrap, that all getters are optional and that non-optional *Value have fallback values. My point is that we should always make sure that errors are propagated back to the client and that we corrupt data without one of those errors.\nIf someone did want to replace the entire JSON when merging with conflicting types, they could simply do:\nlet json: JSON\ndo {\n    json = try json.merged(with: otherJSON)\n} catch {\n    json = otherJSON\n}\nHow does that sound?. @wongzigii Great suggestion! Let's track it here: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/749. @danielkiedrowski Sorry for the delay on this.\nOh got it, I didn't realize it would replace nested types too. I actually think nested fields make a lot more sense to be replaced when they have different types.\nI would expect this:\nlet a = [\"foo\": \"bar\"]\nlet b = [\"foo\": 1]\nlet c = a.merged(with: b) // c.foo == 1\nbut not this:\nlet a = [\"foo\": \"bar\"]\nlet b = [1]\nlet c = a.merged(with: b) // c == [1]\nSo what I would propose here is to only replace nested fields, but add a sanity type check for the root object. Would that work?. You should probably throw an error instead of printing. Missing space after merge. Extra space after get. The indentation is kind of weird, can you replace all this with 4 spaces?.

Also, after fixing up the SwiftyJSON source code, make sure to use \"carthage build\" instead of \"update\", as that will wipe out all your local changes before building, reverting all the instances of \"as!\" back to \"as\" and generating a ton of errors.\nAs for the backwards compatibility issue, can't you make the changes and tag it as a major version update, i.e. 3.0.0, and advise all non-beta users to stay on 2.x.x?\n. iOS 9 and XCode 7 are now out of beta and are the latest public stable releases.

If you do, that might be the same issue that others described in #200.\n. This seems to happen only if SpriteKit is imported somewhere in the project. See my comments on #200.\n. That doesn't seem to be possible currently. The subscript setter can only update existing entries for the array case.\nModifying the wrapped Array via json.arrayObject!.append(...) could work.\n. You could use the (quite new) array-based initializer: JSON(myArray.map { $0.toJSON() }), which has been added in 28ab56bc653298111f623b1269088355f65a6b8b.\nI don't think this can be done with an implicit type conversion in Swift.\n. In Swift, [:] represents an empty dictionary, but SwiftyJSON doesn't have an dictionary-based initializer yet. This should be quite easy to add.\n. Just checked it: var json:JSON = [:] works, because JSON implements the DictionaryLiteralConvertible protocol.\n. There seems to be an issue with the subscript operator in Swift 1.2. It returns nil when a Swift dictionary is converted to AnyObject, which is what SwiftyJSON does here.\nThe following snippet prints nil, not Optional(\"World\"):\nlet obj: AnyObject = [\"Hello\":\"World\"]\nprintln(obj[\"Hello\"])\nI already reported a bug to Apple.\nPull request follows.\n. The error seems to occur only if there is an \"import SpriteKit\" somewhere in the project.\n. @slysid, @Jan0707: JSON({\"unit:kms\"}()), is basically the same as JSON(\"unit:kms\"). It just creates a a JSON instance representing the string \"unit:kms\". To create a JSON instance representing a dictionary, you need to pass a Swift dictionary to the initializer, e.g. JSON([\"unit\" : \"kms\"]). To parse a string into a JSON instance, you could use something like that (quite ugly because the quotes need to be escaped):\nJSON(data: \"{\\\"unit\\\":\\\"kms\\\"}\".dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)!)\n. @Jan0707: After removing the .URLString from your code, it compiles and prints http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/144440 on my environment. Which iOS SDK do you use?\n. @Jan0707 Strange, that's exactly how I do it. Maybe you could create a minimal example (Code Snippet including a small JSON string) that fails and put it into a Gist?\n. This fixes the occasional nil dictionary values reported in #200.\n.

Strangely, I had tried this in the past, but it hadn't worked for me. But it did this time! Thanks @fertejada!\n. First, I get a JSON response from an Alamofire POST request.

CC @ianpartridge @skyline75489 @zhigang1992\n I've created #943, any code review would be appreciated \ud83d\ude4f. This issue has been addressed. Closing now.. @jaymutzafi  \nYour issue is because let json = JSON(data!) is actually calling this initializer init(_ object: Any).\nIf you correct it to let json = JSON(data: data!), then you will get it.\nI admit this initializer is misleading somehow,  as part of SwiftyJSON 3.1.4,  in this case if you trying to passing a data object to init(_ object: Any), data will be parsed successfully.. Closing this due to lack of activity. Feel free to reopen if you have any other questions!. Hey @LucasVanDongen I assume yours is not related to this issue. Would you mind open another issue for this?. Maybe related to https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/1755\n. I don't see this leak in the latest Xcode 8.2.

Would you like to share some progress on this ?\n\n. @alynmuntean Would you mind uploading a sample project to reproduce this ?\n. Everything works fine on my laptop. Have you changed the build settings? Are you running on a 32bit machine?\n. rm -rf ~/.cocoapods/repos/master\nThis could take a long time to go,  please wait :)\npod install\n. Closing.. @brandonlee503 Thanks for the following up!. @4np I believe your issue is related to #705 .\n. If I understand you correctly, you are trying to inherit a JSON from a class. I don't think structs in Swift have inheritance since now. :(\n. @SeongBrave I believe your issue is related to an approach to mapping realm-friendly model. I would suggest you to use ObjectMapper to handle that chore job.. Hey @patricks \nYou are parsing a long JSON file . This will cause a gargantuan memory consumption. I would recommend you \n1. write your data into file then read file with Data(contentsOf:options:)  method with Data.ReadingOptions.uncached and Data.ReadingOptions.alwaysMapped flag\n2. separate parsing job into several parts\n(Or use something likes  YAJL SAX style JSON parser )\n. I believe the documentation is outdated \ud83d\udc4d \n. ~> means it will compatible with the version you pointing to. \nIf you want v2.3.1 exactly,  please use\ngithub \"SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON\" == 2.3.1\n. I believe it's 2.3.1, according to the release note. \n. @cikpis FYI: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/releases/tag/3.1.3\n. @daviejaneway (FYI) Once #707 merged, you might need to update Package.swift to a proper version of SwiftyJSON.\n. @athzuma Any chance to try this?\nswift\nlet json = JSON(data: data as Data)\nprint(json[\"ServicoCliente\"][0][\"id\"])\n. No, I just export your data into a single json file, and the output is 195.\n. What does does not work means ? Are you using Alamofire ? What is the result of response ?\n. So hard to say what exactly your problem is. Would you mind including some codes here so we could dig more?\n. @ldiqual SPM currently doesn't provide a way to include resources e.g. .json file to be tested.\nRelate: \nhttps://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/Week-of-Mon-20161114/003987.html\nhttps://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/Week-of-Mon-20161107/003912.html. It makes sense at this time as a workaround. I will give it a try later.. Closing in favor of #943 . For those who suffer this issue, you can use my branch as a workaround for now:\n.Package(url: \"https://github.com/wongzigii/SwiftyJSON.git\", majorVersion: 3, minor: 1)\n. @zhigang1992 Would you mind pushing a new release so that SPM could catch this up? \ud83d\ude03\n. @zhigang1992  Confirmed\n\u279c  swift build\nCloning https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON.git\nHEAD is now at 1dc2ce0 Merge pull request #699 from JeffGuKang/feature/Playground\nResolved version: 3.1.2\nCompile Swift Module 'SwiftyJSON' (1 sources)\nCompile Swift Module 'MyProject' (1 sources)\nLinking ./.build/debug/MyProject\n.

Hey @devM4x \nWhat's json looks like ?  Are your trying to parse data from dataFromNetworking ?\n. Closing this due to lack of activity. Feel free to reopen if you have any other questions!. @sujaykakkad Source folder is fine. What's the progress on this? Would you need someone to help out?. Are you using Carthage ? Try adding a --no-use-binaries flag after carthage update.\ncarthage update --platform iOS --no-use-binaries\n. @bishalg I would suggest you to use carthage bootstrap for CI build. https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/1403\n. SwiftyJSON was being downloaded precompiled by Carthage. The precompiled version was with Swift 3.0. So compiler complains that for the version is not match. \nI would suggest you guys to build Swift frameworks from code locally.\nThis is not a bug of SwiftyJSON, though. Instead, it is a limitation of Swift at this time until Swift's ABI get stable. \ud83d\ude04 . @solidcell  You can use the latest SwiftyJSON 3.1.4 while using Xcode 8.2 .FYI #764 . Closing. As of Xcode 8.2 recommend settings in #764 \nThanks everyone. \ud83d\ude4f . FYI: Sometimes CI is broken for this known issue: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6675. LGTM. I would like to defer to @zhigang1992 and move on.. Since this is a breaking change, what about adding a change log entry for this? . @ldiqual I want to get this into mater. Could you resolve the conflict?  Seems the conflict is related to #664. Closing in favor of #833 . From 4.0.0, \"yes\" and \"1\" will return true if you call .boolValue. See #887. Closing now.. Hi @gmoledina Thanks for you contribution. One thing I want to ensure is: Is SwiftyJSON still buildable with Xcode 8.0? \nHere is a relate issue: https://github.com/antitypical/Result/pull/193. self-merged. @zhigang1992 . Duplicate of https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/716. Agree! Feel free to submit a PR. :). Hey @Uk44 , thanks for filling an issue.\n\nWhat's your CocoaPods version?\nWhich version of SwiftyJSON you are trying to integrate?. Closing this due to lack of activity. Feel free to reopen if you have any other questions!. Hello @flybrotherlixiang .Thanks for your PR so much! I would like to merge this into master. Could you help out to fix some format, which it should use 4 spaces indentation instead, otherwise I will fix this by myself.. Sorry for the late response. @flybrotherlixiang Looks like rawArray is being set correctly now, so I am going to close this issue. https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/blob/master/Source/SwiftyJSON.swift#L225 \n. I am going to close this now. FYI, Swift 4.0 has brought the NSNumber casting, you can checkout the in-process #943 to figure out the test cases about NSNumber.\n\nSee https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0170-nsnumber_bridge.md\nNote:\n\nConsiderations for Linux platforms\nWe do not have bridging on Linux so the as? cast is less important; but if it were to have bridging this would be the desired functionality.\n. Closing this for #664 . @FridaySG Yes, I believe this is an existing issue on Ubuntu, I am currently working on this. Thanks for filling this. We are going to support this ASAP.. @elk941 Sorry for the late response, I have maintained a fork here to start Linux bridging progress. SwiftyJSON is already buildable on Linux, however, there are still some testcases which need more investigation. . @Takanu @rlubke Hey, can you try the this swift-test-macos branch https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/tree/swift-test-macos to see if this work for you?. @drewmccormack Try this branch if you are playing with Linux platform.. Closing in favor of #744 . > Can there be an initializer in the JSON class that accepts a string containing the JSON code, and initializes the object with it? \n\nHi @Phacometer If you mean initializing a model object from JSON mapping, I recommend you to use a mapping framework: etc. Unbox, ObjectMapper. \nClosing for now. If you have any issue, feel free to reopen it. :). Cool! Thanks! @looseyi .

I've addressed the issue of \"1\" and \"yes\" 's `boolValue` in #887 and credit your name in pre-release note. Cheers!. Thanks @JeffGuKang . Good catch! . Hi @sandipdhagdi You should use a asynchronous image framework likes:[SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage) (Objective-C) or [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) (Swift) , to prevent blocking your main thread while downloading image.. Hello @OuSS-90  Sorry for the late response. Can you take a look at #215 ?. Thanks! @lbrndnr . Close as duplicate of #764. Thank you! @kscheff \ud83c\udf85 \ud83c\udf89 . You can use `init(_ object:)` to create a JSON object likes:swift\nlet arr: [String]! = [\"fish\", \"beef\", \"lamb\"]\nlet arrayObject = JSON(arr).arrayObject\n```. Hey @tarang9211 Just take a look at the issues list and pick the one you're interested. :). Hello there! I just uploaded a latest archive file compiled with Swift 3.0.2. This issue will be closed now. Thanks for filling an issue. Cheers! \ud83d\udc4f .     carthage update --no-use-binaries SwiftyJSON. Closing.. Hey @alychyana. Sorry for the late response. From the code you given, I assume you are trying to set the[:]` \uff08which is a dictionary\uff09\n````swift\nfunc testUnlimitedElements() {\n        var jsonTPXtest: JSON = JSON([\"events\": [:]])\n    for index in 0...20 {\n        jsonTPXtest[\"events\"][\"\\(index)\"] = [\"id\":index,\"x1\":0,\"x2\":0]\n        XCTAssertEqual(jsonTPXtest[\"events\"][\"\\(index)\"], [\"id\":index,\"x1\":0,\"x2\":0])\n    }\n}\n\n````\nHowever, if you wanna set the array indeed, you would need to create a fixed size array.\n````swift\nfunc testUnlimitedElements() {\n        var jsonTPXtest: JSON = JSON([\"events\": [[:], [:], [:], [:]]])\n    for index in 0...4 {\n        jsonTPXtest[\"events\"][index] = [\"id\":index,\"x1\":0,\"x2\":0]\n        XCTAssertEqual(jsonTPXtest[\"events\"][index], [\"id\":index,\"x1\":0,\"x2\":0])\n    }\n}\n\n```\n. Hey @robertmryan Totally agree! We are considering to drop NSErrorPointer for next major release. FYI #749. I am happy to merge this into master at that time, though. Thank you for your works. \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks @robertmryan !. Awesome, thank you. @skyline75489 \ud83d\udca5 . Sorry for late reply. I had just pushed 3.1.4 to CocoaPods. Feel free to hit me up if there is still an issue. Closing. \ud83d\udea2 . Hey @justinmakaila Sorry for the late reply. Is https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/475 what you are looking for?. Sorry for the late response. I just uploaded a latest archive which compiled with Swift 3.0.2, tagging with3.1.4`. Cheers!. Thanks! @craiggrummitt . @juicyfru1t Not sure what's wrong with you code right now? If you could provide a sample project which could demonstrate this leak, it will be able to quickly iterate on the solution if so.. FYI: This leak is caused by Alamofire. \n\nIt seems like this issue is related to https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/1717.\nI am going to close this now, feel free to re-open it if you need.\n. Hey @djdance Sorry for the late response. Could you provide a specific sample to reproduce it?. I assume this issue can be closed since #793 would fix the mutability. Thanks for reporting this. . Closing. . Hi @cikpis I just uploaded a latest archive which still tagged 3.1.4, there should not be an issue now. Thanks for filling an issue. Cheers!. rm Cartfile.resolve file and run carthage update again.. @crickabhi Looks like you have a duplicate SwiftyJSON module ? Could you please open a new issue ?. @AleksandarPetrov @haiderashfaq I would love to take a look at this if you guys can share a sample project to reproduce this. :). Good to know you solved! I am closing this for now! Feel free to open if you have any issue.. You should consider to use CocoaPods or Carthage to manage swift module.. The latest Socket.IO works for me. One thing need more consideration is:  JSON is a typealias of  [String: Any] in Socket.IO. \nSee https://github.com/nuclearace/Socket.IO-Client-Swift/blob/163a770abc4842250d31b8662354d0df190c2885/Source/SocketTypes.swift#L45. @yonlau You can specific the JSON with the namespace, SwiftyJSON.JSON or SocketIO.JSON. . Unfortunately, dictionary is an un-order data struct in Swift and Objective-C. You might need to use an array with some kind of sort algorithm. eg. array.sort() { $0.age < $1.age }. Closing for now. Feel free to open it if need. :). Looks good to me.. Merged. Thanks \ud83d\udcaf  @MikotoZero . Thanks for your contribution. @Humoud . Hi @calvinorchiz From what you have given, elements is an array which wrapping with a [] . :). Pretty strange behavior. \ud83e\udd14 \n````swift\nmutable[\"mutable\"] = [1, 2, 3] // this works\nXCTAssertEqual(mutable[\"mutable\"], [1, 2, 3])\nmutable[\"mutable\"] = [] // this fails\nXCTAssertEqual(mutable[\"mutable\"], [])\n````. Hey @MikotoZero Thanks for your PR, I will review this If I have some spare time at this weekend. :). #793 has been merged into master. \nI've added a MutabilityTests to track down these use cases.\nCheers. . Hey @gsabran Thanks for this PR, anyway #793 has been merged. I am going to close this now. Let me know If you have any issue. :) \nCheers!. Hey @interchen \nIn your first example, \\uD83C*** is not a valid character. If you remove the duplicate *, JSON will be parsed successfully. Unfortunately, SwiftyJSON does not  provide a way to verify your character if is valid at this time. Let me know if there is any issue. :). Hey @gsabran Seems like the format is broken, would you mind fixing it? Or I will do it by myself.. Thanks! @jobinsjohn . Addressed in #887 Thanks!\n. Hey @dirk68-fu Did you try adding a module name before extension, for instance:\nswift\nextension SwiftyJSON.NSNumber {\n    var isBool:...\n}\nIs this solve your problem?. I noticed your comment is SwiftJSON, is it a typo? (Should be SwiftyJSON). @dirk68-fu It seems like there is no way to disambiguate them. A workaround here may look like (not test):\n````swift\nlet a = 1 as SwiftyJSON.NSNumber\nlet b = 1 as Alamofire.NSNumber\na.isBool // SwiftyJSON's NSNumber extension\nb.isBool // Alamofire NSNumber extension\n````. LGTM Thanks so much!  @neoneye . @quanguyen You're right. Mergeability is a new feature included in SwiftyJSON 3.1.4. I should bump the minor version number to follow Semantic Versioning. Sorry about this. \ud83d\ude22 . Hey @unittesting0 ,  you will likely want to perform an ad-hoc export to see the size of each thinned variant of your app anyway. Does not test it but it may works.. Addressed in #887\n. IBM's branch is Linux compatible since Swift 3.0? or even earlier, I believe this is a good point where we can start from cause we are going to focus on Linux platform in the future.. @bostonmacosx You should use \nvar tempJSON: JSON = JSON(parseJSON: test1)\n\nto construct a JSON object if you are parsing from string literal.. Hey @chessboy, thanks for filling an issue here. It seems like you are using an old version SwiftyJSON (3.0.0), which is not compatible with Xcode 8 and Swift 3.1. . @justinctlam \nAre you getting the same compiler warning as this issue? \nAre you using CocoaPods or Carthage ?\nWhat's the version of your dependency manager?. Great to hear that! So I assume this issue can be closed now. Feel free to open another issue if you have any problems.. Thanks @mictab . @pachun @spurdow  We need to build the framework with the local swift version at this time. This is a pain point of using Carthage pre-built framework.\nSee https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/700#issuecomment-287955781 \n. Thanks for the following up! Glad you work fine. @spurdow . Closing for inactivity.. Thanks, @JackSteven I should have noticed this, my bad.. Hey @zhihuitang In your case, info is a JSON object, so calling rawString()  results in the string representation of JSON. \nFWIW, you can still obtain the string value without \\\\ and \\n if you access the value directly.. @zhigang1992 . Added documentations about API breaking change.. Hi all, sorry for late response. \ud83d\ude22 \nTL,DR:\nReplace \npod 'SwiftyJSON', '~> 3.1.1'\n\nwith\npod 'SwiftyJSON-3.1.1'\n\nWhat happens:\nIt seems like the CocoaPods/Spec is pointing to a wrong tag with a  'v' prefix as this issue stated.\nTo solve this issue, I try to run pod trunk push to push a new 3.1.1 tag so that we can replace the old podspec. Unfortunately, it seems that this is not a recommend way due to this \n\nIf you want to modify an existing CocoaPod you should be shipping a new patch version.\nCan I submit a pull request if..\nQ: I want to update my Pod to a new version?\nA: No, this is no longer the appropriate way to update your Pod. Pod updates must be uploaded using pod trunk push [NAME.podspec].\n\nand this.\n\nYou cannot overwrite a spec using trunk. You should just push a new version with your changes. \n\nFWIW, So the workaround: I just pushed a new pod called SwiftyJSON-3.1.1, which should contain the old specific version:\npod 'SwiftyJSON-3.1.1'\n\nLet me know if there is still an issue.\nNote: if you are getting warnings while building the framework, you should consider to use a newer version of SwiftyJSON cause that warnings are being compressed when using old Xcode(old Swift version) at that time.\nZigii Wong. Hey @philippeauriach  Sorry for the late response.\nJust drop the arrayObject and you will be good:\nswift\nmyJson[\"array\"] = []. Hey @mzbik Thanks for pointing this out, I would prefer the first solution. In SwiftyJSON, JSON is designated to be a struct type, from this point, we are not expecting the JSON(data from server) is strictly mutable.. Sorry @dyang , we are not going to support this.. AFAIK, _ObjectiveCBridgeable is a private protocol use internally within swift standard library, it may be changed in the future release.\nConsidering this, we are not going to implement this until 0058-objectivecbridgeable  launched. . Good catch :). Carthage is using this to checkout and build the scheme independently.. A pr for this issue will be appreciated :D . Thanks for this! @matthew-an . Try this online json parser: http://json.parser.online.fr/\nJSON will finally transfer to the readable format.. @praveenambekar Can you post the crash message here?. Looks like the Travis CI is broken.. Hey @LeoValentim This is related to this issue https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/839. Thanks @JeffGuKang . Closing as a duplicate of https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/839. Relate to https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/839.     pod 'SwiftyJSON-3.1.1'. @Sukhrob You need to update your local pod spec.. @nitrag Can you post the result from getGeoJSON function? What is the JSON looks like?. Hey @webersson \n1st: \n\nHow could i remove the quotation marks before the data is stored in core data? \n\nYou can use json[\"age\"].intValue or json[\"age\"].int to handle as Int.\nYou can also use SwiftyJSON/Alamofire-SwiftyJSON to parse json directly.\n2nd:\n\nHow would it be possible to change the \"100m_running_time\" key into \"running_time_100m\" before it gets fetched into core data?\n\nMutating a json(value type) is not a recommend way IMO, except you need indeed, but changing 100m_running_time to running_time_100m from your backend server would be more elegant.\nHowever, you can construct a new json from the old one which may met your need.\n3rd:\nYou can check the null with json[\"Data\"].null == NSNull(), sorry for the inconvenience, we are planning to add such null check.. Addressed in #887. Fixed in #848 . Thanks for the pull request! I've addressed this issue in #887 and credit your name in pre-release note. Cheers!.

This is useful when you are writing unit test.. This should work in the latest version. . SwiftyJSON will continue with Swift 4. 4.0.0-alpha.1 is the first pre-release version compatible with Xcode 9.. @keason If you run pod search SwiftyJSON locally and the resut of seach is missing something likes:\n-> SwiftyJSON (4.0.0-alpha.1)\nSwiftyJSON makes it easy to deal with JSON data in Swift\npod 'SwiftyJSON', '~> 4.0.0-alpha.1'\n.......\n\nYou will need to run pod repo update to update the latest pod spec.

JSON's dictionary does not guarantee to be listed in order, you should consider to use an array instead. (if you need in order data). Thanks @otaviolima . The latest version [4.0.0] is compatible with Swift 4.1.. I am going to close this issue. If you have any questions, please open another issue. Thanks.. @antsangrigoli \nlet jsonObject = JSON(jsonRequest)would be fine.. @cx5168 What kind of dependency manager you are using?. Closing as inactivity.. I've created #959 Thanks for this PR anyway..

For more info for the --no-use-binaries flag, see here. You can clone the whole project and build the framework by yourself. Or you can use Carthage to auto-build framework.. Hey @meghs91 Thanks for this PR! \nCan you please fix the format so the README could look nicer?\n\n. Ah sorry for the misleading. I just mean changing the word to uppercasing. . Thanks @qkdreyer .

Thanks @egorzhdan  one question: should we add swiftLanguageVersions: [.v4, .v4_2] to this file?. +1 for throws here. . Since NSError Bridging was launched in Swift 3, we could consider to move NSError to  Swift's Error. Another PR for this is welcomed, though.. \ud83d\udcaf . Should we use parse(jsonString ...) instead of parse(json ...) ? This might be ambiguous.. I would prefer clearer over cleaner : parse(json: JSON) and parse(jsonString: String). :). nitpick: unwrapped, double p. \ud83d\udc4d  for format. But a single separate commit for this would be much appreciated.. There is an existed file called NestedJSONTests.swift. Would you mind moving your test cases into that file?. Those JSON.init can be simplify to JSON. Might be testNestedJSON?. nitpick: this dictionary should format with a trailing space after :, just like line 135.. What about this for setter?\nswift\nif self.type == .array && self.rawArray.indices.contains(index) && newValue.error == nil {\n    self.rawArray[index] = newValue.object\n}. https://github.com/matthew-an/SwiftyJSON/blob/6b7c67c6c38eaf92e52a45908a238b4fc442c24e/Source/SwiftyJSON.swift#L421 should be refactored too.. If this struct is used by testCodableModel only, shouldn't we move it into the function?. Every test function should start with an empty line within Tests class.. Nitpick: Prefer testListCoder -> testArrayCodable. Nitpick: Prefer testDictCoder -> testDictionaryCodable. - JSON Cafe\n- JSON Export\nI would prefer this markdown format.. Your email address should change to another example address something likes abc@gmail.com.

Multiply that by a dozen times and it's not very nice, compared to the intuitive, obvious, and terse j[\"a\"].int. The priority, as far as the semantics go, should be developer intention and usefulness.  We're using SwiftyJSON to parse our data and not code, and it stops just short of that goal by insisting that a string in the source JSON has to be parsed as a String, even if I know it is an Int. \nEverything starts out as a String, that's why we're using a library to parse it. The JSON spec may say that \"5\" is a string and 5 is a number, but I happen to know differently. I care whether an Int can be parsed from it, not whether or not SwiftyJSON happens to know that it is an Int. Developer knowledge should trump naive type detection.\n. ",

    "namanhams": "Hi,\nIt seems that XCode apps are quite unreliable now. I tried with XCode 7.1 beta then it shows memory leak. I tried with XCode 7.0 GM then no memory leak. I highly believe this is XCode problem, because i did investigate this issue and it seems that SwiftyJSON doesn't do anything that can cause the memory leak. \nI'll keep monitoring it more.\n. I just found out exactly the same as Tehong. It seems that this is bug with Swift, but has been fixed in XCode 7.1 beta 2. \n. It's documented very clearly here https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON\n. I updated the link. It's just the github link of this library. \n. What's the error you got ? The documentation says very clearly on how you can retrieve the value of a key in the json response. \n. ",
    "tehong": "I have detected the same memory leak problem with the JSON(result) with xCode 7.0 GM.  I commented out the let json = JSON(result) line and the leak went way.  Am I using the code incorrectly?  I have a lot of Alamofile URL Get and JSON results,  this caused my application to run out of memory quickly.\n. Could this be the same memory leaks in the Argo swift?  See  https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo/issues/205.  This is related to Switch ... as.. statement that Apple said that could result in memory leak.\n. According to Apple xCode 7.0 release note.  \nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/xc7_release_notes.html\n\nUsing switch against multiple types with as patterns may cause a memory leak. For example, avoid this kind of switch statement:\nswitch x {\n  case let a as A: ...\n  case let b as B: ...\n  case let c as C: ...\n  default: ...\n}\nRewrite the code to use if let a = x as? A statements instead of switch. This pattern performs type checks that avoid the memory leak. (22587077)\nSwiftyJSON uses the syntax extensively.  We need a workaround ASAP.\n. There is only one block of code that has the switch... as expressions.  I modified the following code in the SwiftyJSON.swift file and the memory leak went away:\nif let number = newValue as? NSNumber {\n                if number.isBool {\n                    _type = .Bool\n                } else {\n                    _type = .Number\n                }\n                self.rawNumber = number\n            } else if let string = newValue as? String {\n                _type = .String\n                self.rawString = string\n            } else if let _ = newValue as? NSNull {\n                _type = .Null\n            } else if let array = newValue as? [AnyObject] {\n                _type = .Array\n                self.rawArray = array\n            } else if let dictionary = newValue as? [String : AnyObject] {\n                _type = .Dictionary\n                self.rawDictionary = dictionary\n            } else {\n                _type = .Unknown\n                _error = NSError(domain: ErrorDomain, code: ErrorUnsupportedType, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: \"It is a unsupported type\"])\n            }\n/*\n        switch newValue {\n        case let number as NSNumber:\n            if number.isBool {\n                _type = .Bool\n            } else {\n                _type = .Number\n            }\n            self.rawNumber = number\n        case  let string as String:\n            _type = .String\n            self.rawString = string\n        case  _ as NSNull:\n            _type = .Null\n        case let array as [AnyObject]:\n            _type = .Array\n            self.rawArray = array\n        case let dictionary as [String : AnyObject]:\n            _type = .Dictionary\n            self.rawDictionary = dictionary\n        default:\n            _type = .Unknown\n            _error = NSError(domain: ErrorDomain, code: ErrorUnsupportedType, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: \"It is a unsupported type\"])\n        }\n        */\nSo this is the right workaround.\n\n. This is addressed in XCode 7.1 beta 2.  It is in the release notes.\n. I don't think so.  Just modify SwiftyJSON.swift in your xCode SwiftyJSON framework directory as I did and that will eliminate the memory leak for any product produced with xCode prior to xCode 7.1 beta 2.\n. ",

    "gkaimakas": "\nI agree that it might cause some mental overhead for other people. A small explanation would work I think.\nConsider this case:\n\nYou expect from the server a JSON response that must absolutely contain a field called id that is an integer, and the response might have another field, title, that is optional.\nYour object would be the following then\n```\nstruct SomeObject: SwiftyJSONSerializable {\n   let id: Int\n   let title: String?\ninit(id: Int, title: String) {\n       self.id = id\n       self.title = title\n   }\ninit? (json: JSON) {\n       guard let id = json[\"id\"].int else { return nil }\n       self.init(id: id, title: json[\"title\"].string)\n   }\n}\n```\nIf for some reason the server does not send the id field your code will continue to work and you can probably deduce that there was a mandatory field that was missing from the response to begin with. \nSomeone could argue that having the init throw would be better suited and more generic but I think that it would complicate the code a lot. For my use cases it was sufficient for the init to be failable\n. I see your point. I will take a look at it.\nIf I have anything new I will post a new PR\n. ",

Not a long term solution but a decent one in the meantime.\nSee https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#pod for more information.\n. You're welcome :)\nActually, it doesn't matter if the .podspec currently commited in the tag 2.3.3 has version 2.3.2 because cocoapods use the spec published in the specs repo and only the version in that file really matters when running pod [install|update].\nDuring the process of pushing a new version, cocoapods use the tag currently defined in the local .podspec to checkout the pod directly from the git repo and check if everything compile without issues. That's why you need to tag a version before pushing it to cocoapods.\nSo in theory, publishing the 2.3.3 afterwards is possible! Hope it's clear!\n. ",

Moved to #905 . @B-Gio-KGJ I think that is the Swift language's feature. \nIf you write more code, it will be good to understand what you tried.. Is this typo? You did not close the bracket invar json =  JSON([\"array\": [1, 2, 3])`\n. @alicksnake22 @garrettjmilovich \nI tested JSON.arrayObject?.remove in playground.\nswift\nvar testJson = JSON.init([1, 2, 3])\nprint(testJson[0]) // 1\ntestJson.arrayObject?.remove(at: 0) // remove first object as 1\nprint(testJson) // 2, 3\ntestJson.arrayObject?.remove(at: 1) // remove second object as 3\nprint(testJson) // 2\nBut I could not find any problems.

",
    "gsabran": "Yes, but this doesn't play well with dictionaries that have optional values, which can't be represented with NSNull. I've addressed it in my PR https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/610 and there's now an option to do that:\nswift\nlet user = [\n  \"name\": \"me\",\n  \"username\": nil,\n] as [String: Any?]\nlet representation = JSON(user).rawString(options: [.castNilToNSNull: true])\n// representation is {\"name\": \"me\", \"username\": null}\n. Actually it seems to already work :)\n. Thanks. I was not good enough to find exactly where this difference is happening so I could not do a PR\n. Yes, I'm trying to address the conversion of nil to json. Many objects have optionals and it felt natural to be able to convert them to json, and those json to string representation. It's really weird to think that a json with nil should have no string representation.\nCurrently it's not possible to convert such a json object to a string representation.\nTo you, how does the value is null differ from this thing doesn't exists. In both cases, there's no confusion on wether or not the key exists, because both \n[\"foo\": nil] as [String: Any?]\nand\n[\"foo\": NSNull()] as [String: Any]\nconvey the idea that there's a key foo. I guess this question is not really json related, but more like what difference in meaning do you see between the two objects above?\n. I agree this is all very confusing. I've dig a bit into this, and found even more confusing things.\nI get your point that json[\"sup\"] = nil deletes one key instead of setting a value to nil, and I believe that this shorthand is some bad design from swift more than anything else, especially given the questions raised in the SO post linked above. I'd much rather do json.removeValue(forKey: \"sup\") but this is a personal opinion.\nI also think we need to have something that fits the daily challenges of developers, so I don't think it's fine to not be able to serialize dictionaries with nil values, that for instance could represent object with optionals fields. So if the solution is to drop the fields with nil values and serialized what's remaining, this is already much better than saying we can't convert json to string.\nNSNull and NSJSONSerialization are Objective C things, and their design probably make sense there since there is no optional (other than that, I don't know Objective C that well).\nBut frankly in Swift I don't get the point of NSNull and the only time I've considered using it was to replace nil in dictionaries to parse them to json. So this might also be a bit of my personal opinion, but to me Swift NSNull should be forgotten, Swift nil is equivalent to json null, and Swift should forget about its shorthand to remove keys from dictionaries.\nHappy to learn/discuss anything I'm missing here!\n. Is the discussion closed? What about having this as an optional way to cast to string? Like\n`` swift\nfunc rawString(\n  _ encoding: String.Encoding = .utf8,\n  options opt: [JSONSerialization.WritingOptions],\n  maxObjectDepth: Int = 10\n) throws -> String? {\n  // then, if an option is passed to castniltoNSNull`, do it, else don't, like\n  // rawString(options: [.prettyPrinted, .castingNilToNSNull])\n  ...\n}\n// and keep the original one for backward compatibility:\nfunc rawString(\n  _ encoding: String.Encoding = .utf8,\n  options opt: JSONSerialization.WritingOptions = .prettyPrinted\n) -> String? {\n  return rawString(encoding, options: [opt])\n}\n``\n. Ok I've rebased\n. Let me see what I can do for the option\n. I've changed things so that:\n- the previous syntax works as before\n- you have more options to describe the string casting, likejson.rawString(options: [.castNilToNSNull: true]). Ah sure. Let me look at what has change on the main branch\n. I've rebased\n. It seems weird thatXCTAssertEqual(json[\"inner_json\"], [\"some_field\": \"12\"])works while I'd expectXCTAssertEqual(json[\"inner_json\"].rawValue, [\"some_field\": \"12\"])to make more sense.\nAnyway I did a similar PR https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/801 (didn't see yours) that works withXCTAssertEqual(json[\"inner_json\"].rawValue, [\"some_field\": \"12\"])`.

Keep in mind, this is not a permanent, but temporary solution, until authors come back and official release is made.\nWhen that happens, SwiftyJSON3 pod will immediately be deprecated in favor of original pod, and after transition period will be removed.\n. @rodrigoruiz Run pod update and you will see it. Also, if you have a fix for infinite loop problem you are talking about, we can fix it in next beta release.\nJSON example would be super helpful.\n. @cobear25 Apparently your Podfile is not configured properly, don't specify git URL or branches, simply use\nruby\npod 'SwiftyJSON3'\nand run pod install.\nCode you are showing on your screenshot is not the code from SwiftyJSON3 repo.\n. @Dbigshooter podspec is definitely there - https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/tree/master/Specs/SwiftyJSON3\nTry running pod repo update before pod install, maybe you were installing on different machine?

Plus, a developer would expect to be able to construct JSON objects like this fairly regularly.

    "TheNamesJames": "Firstly, a minor syntactic clarification: .stringValue never returns nil. Another property, .string will return nil if the value of that JSON instance is not a String.\n.stringValue on the other hand, will return an empty string (\"\") in these cases.\nn.b. From here on, I will assume you meant .string instead of .stringValue.\nWith that (brief) definition of .string, we can now start to see why calling .string on json[\"questions\"] returns nil. While the json at json[\"questions\"] can be represented as a string, it is not actually a String.\n{\n  \"20161111\" : {\n    \"id\" : \"1\",\n    \"name\" : \"Q1\"\n  }\n}\nThe above is a String representation of a Javascript object (specifically a Dictionary). It consists of a single String key (\"20161111\") with another object as its value ({ \"id\" : \"1\", \"name\" : \"Q1\" }). That object is also a Dictionary, consisting of two String keys (\"id\" and \"name\"), each with String values (\"1\" and \"Q1\" respectively).\nAs the value at json[\"questions\"] is a Dictionary, we can call .dictionary to retrieve the actual object.\nside note: This is not actually an issue. If you have any questions with how to use libraries like this one, try asking/searching StackOverflow\n. TLDR: No, DictionaryLiteral is not supported\nWhy?\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not hugely familiar with the core development of SwiftyJSON - this answer is based on reading the source code and a couple assumptions.\n\nIn the current implementation SwiftyJSON, a dictionary's elements are copied, inserting the keys one at a time - inherently losing its order (see SwiftyJSON.JSON.init(dictionaryLiteral:) and SwiftyJSON.JSON.object & SwiftyJSON.unwrap(_:)).\nSo even if an init could instantiate a JSON object, the order would be unstable (either immediately jumbled, or when the dictionary is modified).\nAlso, the JSON spec tells us that a JSON object (Dictionary being the Swift equivalent) is an \"unordered set of name/value pairs\" so, besides the SwiftyJSON limitation, the JSON spec itself holds no guarantees on the ordering of name/value pairs (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/4920304).\n\nSide note for your update:\nSwift's DictionaryLiteral type and JSON.init(dictionaryLiteral:) (from the ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral protocol) are not directly related (see how the argument type is different) - perhaps a little misleading.\nJSON.init(dictionaryLiteral:) expects arguments more like this:\n```swift\nlet json = JSON(dictionaryLiteral: (\"Date\", \"Cool\"),\n                (\"Time\", [\n                    \"Morning\": \"Cool\",\n                    \"Night\": \"Cool\"\n                    ]))\njson.rawString(options: []) ?? \"\"\n// {\"Date\":\"Cool\",\"Time\":{\"Night\":\"Cool\",\"Morning\":\"Cool\"}}\n```\nBut, really, ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral (along with the other ExpressibleByXXLiteral protocols) is aimed at being used like this:\nswift\nlet json: JSON = [\n    \"Date\" : \"Cool\",\n    \"Time\" : [\n        \"Morning\" :  \"Cool\",\n        \"Night\" : \"Cool\"\n    ]\n]\nI hope this helps?.

",
    "Evertt": ".int! is not the same though, because that will only force unwrap an optional. I mean trying to convert a string integer to a real integer. I would like to have that functionality, while still receiving nil if the conversion was not possible.. Sigh, that's not what I meant. What I mean is that I would want to merge the functionality of .int and .intValue. In other words, I want a computed variable that tries to convert whatever value it holds to an int (like .intValue does), but return a nil when that's not possible (like .int does).. Okay, it proves more difficult to communicate my intention than I had anticipated. I'm going to try one more time to explain and then I'll give up.\nRight now .int is implemented basically like this:\nswift\npublic var int: Int? {\n    if case .number = self.type {\n        return self.rawNumber.intValue\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nNOTE: This is NOT its real implementation, I'm simplifying things for the purpose of this demonstration.\n\nPro of .int: when the rawValue = \"not a number\" it will return nil, which clearly conveys that there's no integer.\nCon of .int: when the rawValue = \"2\", it will also return nil, while \"2\" could perfectly well be converted to an integer 2.\n\nAnd .intValue is basically implemented like this:\nswift\npublic var intValue: Int {\n    switch self.type {\n    case .string:\n        // try to convert string to int.\n        // if that's not possible return 0\n    case .number:\n        // return that number as an int\n    case .bool:\n        // convert bool to int and return\n    default:\n        return 0\n    }\n}\nNOTE: This is NOT its real implementation, I'm simplifying things for the purpose of this demonstration.\n\nPro of .intValue: when the rawValue = \"2\" it will convert it to an integer and return that.\nCon of .intValue: when the rawValue = \"not a number\", it will return 0 and then there's no way of knowing if rawValue was \"not a number\" or if maybe rawValue was actually just the integer 0.\n\nSo like I said, I want to merge these two features, like so:\nswift\npublic var newInt: Int? {\n    switch self.type {\n    case .string:\n        // try to convert string to int.\n        // if that's not possible return nil\n    case .number:\n        // return that number as an int\n    case .bool:\n        // convert bool to int and return\n    default:\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n\nPro of .newInt: when the rawValue = \"2\" it will convert it to an integer and return that.\nPro of .newInt: when the rawValue = \"not a number\" it will return nil, which clearly conveys that there's no usable integer.\n\nSince this new feature is, in my opinion, better than both .int and .intValue, I would argue to make this the new .int and drop the old .int and .intValue.\nAnd this could be applied to bool, and float, double, uint, etcetera.\nPlease tell me you guys understand what I mean now..

Did I miss something?\n. ",
    "ThreeTen22": "Since you cant return an Int or nil from the same function you could extend JSON and create your own computed var  that returns a tuple with the value from .intValue, and whether or not .int returned nil.\nIt could look something like:\n```Swift\nextension JSON {\n   public typealias IntValue = (value:Int, notNil:Bool)\npublic var intEx : IntValue {\n        get {\n            //let newSelf = self\n            if let intValue = self.int {\n                print(\"inside intvalue\")\n                return (value: intValue, notNil: true)\n            }\n            return (value: 0, notNil: false)\n        }\n    }\n}\n//Ex:\nlet myInt = myJsonVar[\"myNumber1\"].IntEx  //myJsonVar[\"myNumber1\"] returns 5\nlet myOtherInt = myJsonVar[\"myNumber2\"].IntEx //myJsonVar[\"notANumber\"] returns \"abc\"\nprint(myInt)\nif myInt.notNil {\n    print(myInt.value)\n}\nprint(myOtherInt)\nif myOtherInt.notNil {\n    print(myOtherInt.value)\n}\n//would print:\n(5, true)\n5\n(0, false)\n``. I get it,  it seems like strings that can be converted to numbers do not work withint?, float?,double?etc while the value versions do.  It seems it comes from how the varnumberis calculated compared tonumberValue`.\nIf you want to modify the api, you can change the computed var number to this:\n```Swift\npublic var number: NSNumber? {\n   get {\n       switch self.type {\n            case .Number, .Bool:\n            return self.rawNumber\n        // added .String case that mimics var numberValue,  but returns nil \n        case .String:\n            let decimal = NSDecimalNumber(string: self.object as? String)\n            if decimal == NSDecimalNumber.notANumber() {  // indicates parse error\n                return nil\n            }\n            return decimal\n       // end addition\n\n        default:\n            return nil\n        }\n    }\n\nset {\n        self.object = newValue ?? NSNull()\n        }\n}\n``\nThe only downside to the above changes is that callingint?on something like \"5.25\", will return true, and return a rounded number. You could modifyint?` to check for this.   \nhere is an extension trueInt? that works with the changes above, but will also check if the value is a whole number.  If it is not a whole number it will return nil.\nswift\nextension JSON {\n    public var trueInt: Int? {\n        get {\n            if let num = self.number as? NSDecimalNumber {\n                let intLong = num.longValue\n                    if num == intLong {\n                        return intLong\n                    }\n                        return nil\n            }\n            return self.number?.longValue\n        }\n        set {\n            if let newValue = newValue {\n                self.object = NSNumber(integer: newValue)\n            } else {\n                self.object = NSNull()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}.

Although I wouldn't mind \"3.14\" generating a \"3\" (Android's core JSON class does the same). Would love to see your pull request merged!. This is the pull request which should fix the inconsistency: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/pull/910. Would like to see it merged. ",
    "Causaelity": "@kevinvanmierlo saw your comments and added some more unit tests to make sure that floats and ints also work.  Had to add additional code to the Int type so that \"3\" would generate 3, while \"3.14\" would generate nil so that it behaves more like Swift typecasting. the intValue version would generate 3 and 0 for the same cases.. Looking at your code I think this is because public var numberValue: NSNumber has a .string case where public var number: NSNumber? does not.  Adding the following code fixed this problem:\nSwift\n   //Optional number\n    public var number: NSNumber? {\n        get {\n            switch self.type {\n            case .string:\n                let decimal: NSDecimalNumber? = NSDecimalNumber(string: self.object as? String)\n                if decimal == NSDecimalNumber.notANumber {  // indicates parse error\n                    return nil\n                }\n                return decimal\n            case .number:\n                return self.rawNumber\n            case .bool:\n                return NSNumber(value: self.rawBool ? 1 : 0)\n            default:\n                return nil\n            }\n        }\n        set {\n            self.object = newValue ?? NSNull()\n        }\n    }. Forked the code, added the fix and provided some new unit tests, created pull request.. I'm not sure how they decide what to merge vs not.  . ",

    "kengruven": "Apple's documentation says:\n\nSwift bridges between the NSNumber class and Swift numeric types, including Int, Double, and Bool.\nYou can create an NSNumber object by casting a Swift number value using the as operator. \n\nAssuming this is still true (the NSNumber should be NSNumber(value: value) in Swift 3, no?), this looks like a bug in Foundation on Linux.\n. There's a few things going on here.  One change is to add support for the string \"yes\" as a bool.  On its own, that looks reasonable to me.\nThe bigger change, to modify the meaning of the getters, is less clear to me.\nFirst, there's some easy fixes which would probably make this more likely to be considered:\n - fix whitespace (as reported by the bot)\n - use nil coalescing, rather than \"if let\" (easier to read, and consistent with other getters)\n - update documentation to accurately describe the new functionality\nHowever, it's not clear to me that this is a worthwhile change to make.  The if let val = json.typename idiom is very convenient, and if we made all getters disregard actual types and just try their best, we'd lose this ability.  In my experience, being able to pass a number in JSON as a number-or-string just isn't a big use case, and not worth making each JSON access check the type on its own.\n. The title of this bug is a bit odd.  It's not the number of digits that's causing the issue, correct?  It's that you've got a string, and you're expecting SwiftyJSON to automatically parse that into a UInt.. @da-na: You say you're calling json[\"errorCode\"].uInt in one case, and json[\"status\"].uIntValue in the other case.  uInt and uIntValue are different vars, which do different things.  \nI can't reproduce any bug here which is related to the number being 3 or 4 digits..

What you are seeing is the floating point representation of an input decimal number, and computers cannot correctly represent all decimal numbers in floating point.\nYou should instead print a string computed by NumberFormatter, configured with a numberStyle set to .decimal. You will then see the correct value:\nlet json: JSON = JSON([\"number\": 8.7])\nlet num = json[\"number\"].numberValue\nlet formatter = NumberFormatter()\nformatter.numberStyle = .decimal\nlet stringOutput = formatter.string(from: num)!\nprint(\"\\(stringOutput)\")\nOutput: 8.7\nNOTE: The console printer does not use NumberFormatter, so even printing an NSNumber will simply call the receiver's doubleValue, leaving you with the conversion error you are encountering.\nWhenever you require parsing, processing, and display of decimal numbers, you should wrap them in NSDecimalNumber or Decimal (Swift's bridge to NSDecimalNumber).\nIn your input JSON, keep these numbers as strings (don't even put a Double into the dictionary!), and then parse them to Decimal directly with an initialiser:\nlet json: JSON = JSON([\"number\": \"8.7\"])\nlet numberAsString = json[\"number\"].stringValue\nlet numberAsDecmal = Decimal(string: numberAsString)\nYou can then do arithmetic using conventional operators like +, -, *, / etc.\nThen, if you require the output printed or displayed on-screen, is must go back through the NumberFormatter. The formatter only takes NSNumber or NSDecimalNumber, but since the latter is bridged, you can simply cast it: numberAsDecimal as NSDecimalNumber.\nNever use Double for any currency related operations.\n.
