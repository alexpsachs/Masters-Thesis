Is it not possible for you to safely and securely make code review of submitted PRs, and conduct appropriate testing and analysis of submissions, and have the correct licence information that ensures your outright ownership of all contributed code?\nIf you start this process by putting up barriers (however small) to contribution, the friction you create will ensure that eventually your open source projects will be replaced and ultimately forgotten by history, because open-sourcing in a productive manner is more than simply opening access to source code, and using Github as a release mechanism.\nMany great open source projects have good developer guidelines that explain what you expect and demand for contribs to be considered, and if you were able to run it like that, with implicit agreement to the T&Cs of submission it would really make a substantial difference.\n. @gaffer01 I hope you are thinking of ways you can move away from this simplistic publication model, and into a more collaborative mode. I understand it's all happening within an organisation that has thousands of internal barriers to collaboratively working on software in an open community, but without that mutual trust, you haven't built any trust, just gave us a tool, which is fine, but ultimately disappointing and not worthy of the same excitement that most other interesting OS projects command.\n.

    "gaffer01": "@iand Thank you for your comment. We have taken advice and are happy that the Apache License is appropriate for this project, and do not think that additionally releasing it under the OGL would provide extra benefit to software developers.\n. Thanks for your interest in the project and for your contribution. We're not yet in a position to accept pull requests as we need to sort out a 3rd party contributor license. Once that is done, and has been signed by contributors, we will be happy to consider pull requests.\nHowever please note that this version of Gaffer (version 1) is no longer under active development. All effort is going into Gaffer 2, which although offering some of the same functionality, has a very different API and different base classes to this version of Gaffer. So it would be worth holding off making contributions to Gaffer 1 and instead waiting for Gaffer 2.\n. @karabijavad Gaffer2 should be available within the next 2 or 3 weeks.\n@SamMorrowDrums Thanks for your thoughts. Having a contributors license is fairly standard - see for example https://code.facebook.com/cla, https://azure.github.io/guidelines.html#cla. But we will consider your points further as we prepare the license.\n. We agree with the comment of @emilv but we are contacting the Apache Software Foundation to double check.\n. Hi. Gaffer2 will not be complete when it is published - it will be a work in progress with plenty of room for further development.\n. The Gaffer2 code is currently being tidied and reviewed before release. Once it has been released, further development will be done here. The hope is to be able to accept contributions from the community, while retaining control of the project in the short term.\n. We are interested in a Tinkerpop API, and whether it could support the range of filtering, aggregation and bulk query options we provide. We do not currently have a timescale for investigating this though. If anyone wants to investigate this, that would be great.\n. Merged into develop.. Can a description of this issue be added please? It doesn't say anything about what the proposed improvements are.\n. The point is that initialising a graph with particular store properties should cause that store to be instantiated. Only initialising it when addElements is called leads to problems when multiple parallel processes simultaneously start writing to a new store.\nYou shouldn't be able to query a table that doesn't exist. You query via a graph and initialising the graph causes the store and hence table to be initialised. If you don't have permissions to create a table then a meaningful exception should be thrown.\n. In \"Building-and-Deploying-Gaffer-Container\", there is an issue on step 8:\ndocker build --rm -t gaffer-docker/centos6:base -f Dockerfile.centos6 .\nThis fails with Error: image gaffer-docker/centos6 not found. Changing the FROM line in Dockerfile.centos6 to centos:centos6.7 fixes this problem.\n. Please remove the file LICENSE from all of the subfolders. Remove all the commented out lines from the file ssh_config (but leave the copyright and Apache license notice).\n. Closing this. Spark functionality will now be implemented in #306.\n. Thanks. A few comments:\n- GafferTableSc.scala: Unnecessary imports should be removed; some scaladoc is broken as need to import Edge and Entity; the 2 onlyGroups methods have wrong scaladoc as it should be groups not group.\n- GraphConfig.java: Need to import Entity, Edge and MockInstance so that Javadoc works; throughout this class the diamond operator should be used to reduce verbosity, e.g. Set<Range> ranges = new HashSet<>(); rather than Set<Range> ranges = new HashSet<Range>();; setConfiguration: The RangeFactoryException should be thrown or wrapped and thrown, not logged and ignored.\n- GafferTable.java: import Entity and Edge so Javadoc works; use the diamond operator.\n- GafferRegistrator.java, class KryoWritableSerializer<T> extends Serializer<Element> - the T isn't used in the body of the class?\n- ElementInputFormat.java: import InputFormat so that Javadoc works; seems to assume ByteEntityAccumuloElementConverter is being used, which won't always be true?\n- BatchScannerElementInputFormat.java: import InputFormat so that Javadoc works; also seems to assume ByteEntityAccumuloElementConverter is being used?\n- In GafferTableData in the unit tests, use the diamond operator; it also appears to use a MiniAccumuloCluster if the store properties specify a MockInstance? Why? A MockInstance is not the same as a MiniAccumuloCluster.\n. Agreed. In general stores should return their results lazily, e.g. if the user queries for a node which has a lot of edges, those edges shouldn't be materialised into a set and then returned. Instead, edges should be read from the underlying data storage as the user consumes them by reading through the iterable. The ArrayList store materialises the set, which should be discouraged and so should be changed to return results lazily. I'll raise a separate issue about this.\n. It looks like both ends of the edge are checked to see if they are in the Bloom filter. Really it is only necessary to check the non-query end of the edge (i.e. the second one in the rowkey). Checking the query end as well will increase the number of false positives.\n. Can you clarify what this behaviour means? What is the first edge returned, i.e. what does (A-B+A-C) mean, what is the source and what is the destination?\nThis behaviour is not generally what is wanted from a range scan. Generally from a range scan you would just want those 3 edges returned. Is it possible to turn the behaviour described above off (and still do aggregation of the values over column family and visibility)?\nIf the data was:\nA-1 GROUP1 Count 1\nA-2 GROUP2 Count 2\nA-3 GROUP1 Count 1\nA-4 GROUP2 Count 2\n...\nA-1000000 GROUP1 Count 1\nA-1000001 GROUP2 Count 2\nthen the the aggregated edge would contain a lot of data (i.e. whatever A-B+A-C means would be large), and if there were a lot of groups then a lot of data would need to be cached before it could be output.\nIn general this breaks the idea that the iterators read data, aggregating into one element, then when the next group is reached, the element is output - it's a very low state process.\nDoes this behaviour work across tablets? A-C might be in a different tablet (and on a different tablet server) to A-B. Does the aggregation work in this case?\n. The most common use case for range scans is to return all edges for vertices in a certain range, doing standard aggregation of properties over column qualifier (e.g. different time windows), e.g. if the graph is:\nA->B GROUP1 date=20160101 count=10\nA->B GROUP1 date=20160102 count=20\nA->C GROUP1 date=20160101 count=5\nB->E GROUP1 date=20160101 count=2\nB->E GROUP1 date=20160102 count=3\nC->F GROUP1 date=20160101 count=2\nC->F GROUP1 date=20160102 count=4\nD->G GROUP1 date=20160101 count=1\nand we specify a range of B to C, the desired edges are:\nB->E GROUP1 date=20160101-02 count=5\nC->F GROUP1 date=20160101-02 count=6\nFrom what you say, this is not currently supported and is not the standard meaning of doing aggregation in a range scan?\n\"Currently all aggregation assumes that all data for the provided ranges lives on the same tablet server, client side aggregation is needed for all cases of aggregation to catch cases where the desired ranges are split across tablet servers.\"\nIs the client side aggregation implemented? If not then the current implementation will not always work and needs fixing.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Probably the right thing to do is to decide whether a schema should allow the same group name for entities and edges, independent of any particular store. I tend to think it should.\nA layer of indirection could be introduced to solve some of the problems you describe, e.g. an entity group of \"red\" could be internally mapped to a group of \"entity_red\", and an edge group of \"red\" could be mapped to \"edge_red\". A map from these forms to the appropriate serialisers, aggregators, could be derived from the schema and could then be used for all the necessary look-ups. When recreating elements from the key-values, the \"entity_\" or \"edge_\" could just be dropped.\n. Looks good. Can one of the classes (probably the main operation SummariseGroupOverRanges) have some Javadoc explaining what it does?\nIterators can't aggregate across multiple tablet servers. If a range spans multiple tablet servers, the current code will not return one aggregated result. Somewhere it should be documented that this is the case.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Looks good, but can we wait before merging this? I'm about to submit a pull request for a serialisation of ints that uses a variable number of bytes (and only 1 byte if the value is less than 128). If we use this in this code where currently 4 bytes are written to give the length of the serialised property, then that should be a significant saving.\n. Do the unit tests check that it works correctly with null properties? There is code to deal with that, and there are unit tests to check that missing properties are dealt with, but there don't seem to be any tests that check that it works if the property is null.\n. If I comment out the TableUtils.ensureTableExists(this) line in the AddElements method in AccumuloStore then lots of tests fail, e.g. AccumuloIDBetweenSetsRetrieverTest fails even though that test does initialise the store. This is because it uses SingleUseMockAccumuloStore. The initialise method in that calls super.initialise which ensures the table exists, but it is then deleted in the rest of the initialise method.\nChanging the order of super.initialise and the deleting of the table calls does not solve the problem as then the getConnection method fails as the MockInstance has not been initialised.\nThis can be solved by calling super.initialise both before and after the delete table call in initialise in SingleUseMockAccumuloStore although that looks a bit odd.\nProbably the best long-term solution is to avoid using SingleUseMockAccumuloStore and give MockAccumuloStore the option to delete the table. Or each test could create its own MockAccumuloStore with its own unique instance name.\n. If no serialiser is provided for a vertex, is a default one used? If so, then it might be worth using a different default serialiser for an integer that is a vertex rather than an integer that is a property.  If a vertex is an integer, then you might want to use a serialiser that preserves the ordering (so not the CompactRaw one), but if the integer is just a property then you don't need to preserve ordering and so should use the CompactRaw one.\n. Could this table be used to check that a table has been initialised by Gaffer? There have been instances where a table has been created in Accumulo manually and then Gaffer data has been put in, and the user isn't aware that this won't function correctly because the correct iterators, etc., have not been applied.\n. True. We could insert a key with some very obscure string as the column family and record in the value when the table was created, and then check for the existence of that before doing any operation on the graph.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop.\n. It also explains why the number of reducers has often been half the number of tablet servers - every second line is ignored (as readLine is called twice in the loop).\n. This should probably be unit-tested, however suggest creating an issue to add unit tests for the whole end-to-end bulk import process and test this as part of that.\n. Could you provide more details? Checking out tag gaffer2-0.4.0 and running mvn clean install doesn't produce that error for me. Which tag are you using? Which version of Java? Which version of maven?\n. Similarly, GetAdjacentEntitySeeds has some options that don't make sense, such as populateProperties and includeEntities.. Closing as a solution to this already exists - use the RangeElementPropertyFilterIterator with the option to return outgoing edges only.\n. A quick look at the code suggests that it's because the visibility field is ignored if it's 0 length - it shouldn't be.\n. If you seed the GetElements operation with an Entity, what results do I get back? e.g. If the seed/id is an Entity with say a property called count with a value of 10, do I only get back Entitys which match exactly, i.e. have exactly the same properties? (Presumably that is what should happen if the matching option is set to EQUALS.) If not, then it seems a bit confusing to allow Entitys to be seeds. If yes, then that requires quite a lot of changes to the current code as the operations would need to be changed to do the full matching.. The Spark-related code is currently split across the modules in the same way as everything else - operations in the operations module, Accumulo handlers in the Accumulo module, etc.\nThis issue is not specific to Spark. We have a dependency on the library that provides HyperLogLogPlus in the serialisation library for example. Any code that uses the Accumulo store has dependencies on Hadoop which has dependencies on many things.\nWhat do we use to decide what belongs in its own module and what doesn't?\nWould we have a separate module for the HyperLogLogPlus serialiser for example?\nJust want to see if we can establish general principles before making Spark a special case.\nIf Spark-related code is moved to its own module, I'd favour having one Spark module with a submodule for operations, and a submodule for the Accumulo handlers, etc.\nAlso see the comment in #535 about why it may be tricky to make Spark just a place where data is exported to.\n. Is there any particular reason for using version 2.2.0 of Hadoop? That's relatively old - sticking with something like 2.6.3 or 2.7.0 might be better?\n. If enumerated types are used, how are they referenced from the REST API? At some point we may want to introduce monitoring that uses the Jobtracker REST APT to retrieve information about the counters. How would they be identified using the enum?\n. \"If the accumulo store receives an schema with no aggregators it should configure the accumulo table using the versioning iterator (i.e don't delete it as we normally do) and don't add the aggregator iterator.\"\nI don't think this is right. If you add the same edge twice (i.e. identical in all ways, including the properties) then that edge should be present in the database twice, and be returned twice from queries. That's the way that all current graph databases work. If we use the versioning iterator then you only get the most recent version which isn't what you want.\nThe versioning iterator should be turned off and no aggregator iterator added.\n. Merged into develop.. Thanks - other classes that need these methods (or at least some of them) are View and Schema and other classes they use. Can this be done as part of this issue, or should it be a separate issue?\n. Closing this pull request as it was easier to create a new one from a fresh copy of develop rather than fix these merge issues.\n. Looks good. Should there be unit tests on the equals() methods? Or is that unnecessary?\n. It's worth noting that some of these operations (specifically the Spark ones) can't be implemented by just taking the results of say GetElements and converting the results into the right format. This is because the way the results are obtained is important - the Spark ones should not be implemented by taking an iterable of results that goes to a client and then converting that into an RDD, the extraction of the results from Accumulo needs to be done in parallel taking into account locality, etc. This is why it uses the InputFormat behind the scenes.\nAnother example is that the operation that returns a Dataframe doesn't actually return any data - no data is returned until subsequent queries are executed against the dataframe.\nThe goal of this issue is good. But it's not as simple as just specifying an output destination/format for the results of the standard get operations.\n. Agree this needs further thought. I think putting operation parameters in the view could be confusing.\nSome seeds for operations are effectively infinite (you can query for a never-ending iterable of seeds).\nSome operations seeds are actually groups of seeds (e.g. edges between these sets of seeds).\nWould every \"seed\" for every operation go in the view? What if the operation took a triangle of edges as a seed and looked for those?\n. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. I think there should be a unit test of what happens when the same element is added multiple times, if there is no aggregation. If the same element is added twice, it should be returned twice.. Can the other problems from the issue be dealt with at the same time or should they be a separate issue?\n\nGetAllElements is a GetElements of ElementSeed  - shouldn't it be a GetElements of Void?\nThe setIncludeIncomingOutGoing method currently says that it is only possible to set this to outgoing edges only. This doesn't make sense - there is no concept of outgoing for GetAllElements. It would be better if this method threw an IllegalArgumentException (even if under the hood it uses that option to avoid returning the same edge twice).. Is it possible to exclude the examples module from codecov? This merge reduces the coverage but it doesn't seem necessary to unit test the examples.. Merged into develop.. Agreed.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. NOTICES file updated, thanks.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. @p013570 Thanks, I'll make those changes.. Merged into develop.. I've updated the NOTICES file as suggested.. Copyright headers updated as requested.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. As part of this will the deduplicate and resultLimit options be removed from operations like GetElements? I think they should be as these are really options that apply to the whole iterable. It's more consistent with standard functional style for these to be operations/functions that are applied after the iterable is created, not as part of the creation of the iterable.. Thanks, looks like that issue will sort it.. Can you add a description of what this common cache service would do?. @AdamRobertsEF Apologies, we've only just noticed your comment. Implementing an in-memory store using Redis would be very interesting and useful. This issue is for a simple in-memory store that will not scale. Redis would obviously allow greater scalability. If you do implement a Redis store, please consider contributing it here.. Closing this issue as it has been merged into develop. There are other open issues to improve the current MapStore, and alternative in-memory stores could be developed, e.g. using Redis - new issues should be created for these.. Closing whilst working on feedback.. I spotted a couple of typos so added a note about them. Otherwise, looks good, but worth @t616178 checking as well as it's a big change.. I think it's fine to have a dependency on an external functions library, but Gaffer should own the core interfaces that define the functions it can do (aggregate, filter elements, transform elements, etc) and these should not depend on external functions libraries. It must be possible to plug-in other function libraries later - we may want to write higher performance libraries later.. This would be useful. I think most of the value will come from extracting data in parallel (via operations like GetRDDOfAllElements) and creating GraphX graphs from that.. Updating this issue to just do FreqMap and HyperLogLogPlus. Using Kryo serialisation for some of the sketches from the DataSketches library needs more work, as classes like DoublesUnion are abstract and the actual concrete implementations of them are not publicly accessible from outside the project. A separate issue will be raised for this.\n\nA separate issue will also be raised for Kryo serialisation of Schema and other properties.. Decided not to implement this. These high-level classes have lots of subclasses, and lots of pluggable classes, which would cause issues with making them serialisable. There are other ways of using these in closures in Spark operations such as recreating them from JSON bytes representation within the function.. Merged into develop.. Thanks for reaching out to us. We would be very interested to learn of new sketches that are in development - is there a list of these available anywhere? We would be keen to implement serialisers and aggregators for them so that they can be used as properties on nodes and edges (implementing these serialisers and aggregators is generally just a case of wrapping some methods from your library in classes that implement Gaffer interfaces).\nWe will also support using HLLSketch from your library, once this pull request has been merged and a version released: https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-core/pull/142.. Thanks. The HLLMap looks interesting. A typical use of HLL in Gaffer is to store a HLL on each node in the graph which allows for a quick estimate of the degree of a node. The only limit on the number of nodes is the limit of the underlying storage technology (e.g. Accumulo or Hbase). The comments on HLLMap say that it is optimised for many millions of keys - does it have any advantages if the number of keys is small, e.g. if there was a need to store several (<5) HLLs on each node, would HLLMap offer a storage advantage over just storing a map from key to HLL?\nExperimenting with UniqueCountMap, it seems that the length of the key must be fixed? Is that an absolute requirement? In practice this could be a bit limiting.\nAs the documentation for HLLMap notes, for datasets where the number of values per key is power-law, the storage cost is dominated by the large number of keys which have a small number of values. It is crucial for the serialisation of a HLL which is almost empty to be very efficient. HLlSketch seems to serialise to 73 bytes even if nothing has been added to it. Is there any way to improve that? One option might be to have an object which accepts items but internally only actually creates a HLL once a certain number of items have been added, e.g. if only one string of length 10 has been added then it would be more efficient to store that than the HLL. If more items are added later then internally a HLL could be created and the previous items added to that.. Thanks for all these comments.\nI can see the advantage of HllMap. Being able to derive other sketches from it is really nice as well. Within Gaffer, nodes can have multiple properties, and the underlying store typically serialises these into a value, with the key being the serialised node. To use HllMap within a store we'd need to store some of the properties on the node, and all the HLLs in the HllMap. It's not impossible to do this, but it doesn't fit into the current Gaffer stores at the moment. The HllMap could of course be used in a streaming setting before data reaches the graph.\n\nThe HllMap was designed for fixed length keys (identifiers), which was critical for efficient map storage and speed.\n\nThe fixed size of the key is understandable. It makes it a little harder to use as we support arbitrary objects as our nodes, so we'd have to hash those into a fixed length byte array to generate the key, ensuring that the array is long enough to avoid collisions, but that's ok.\n\nAll of our sketches have a \"warm-up\" mode where the sketch starts out very small and grows larger only as required by the data.\n\nThanks - yes, we noticed that the sketches increase in size slowly, and this is very useful for conserving space.\n\nThe HllSketch has a number of configuration options, but let me look into it. I think it can be even smaller\n\nIf there was a way of making HllSketch serialise to smaller than 73 bytes when it's close to empty, that would be useful. If not, the idea of creating a wrapper class that stores a set and only creates a HllSketch when the size gets bigger than say 2, may give us all the benefits plus smaller serialisations for sketches that are nearly empty.\n\nof all the different HLL sketches in the library, the one in the HllMap is the most efficient during warmup\n\nIf the HllMap is more efficient in space usage for HLLs with a small number of entries, then is it possible that we should use HllMap with a single key in the use-case of estimating the degree of a node, where we expect the majority of nodes to have low degree? (I assume not based on your earlier comment of not using HllMap for small number of keys.)\n\nWe didn't have the need to ser-de, but if that is important, let us know.\n\nIt would be very useful if HllMap supported SerDe - it makes it much easier to create one from a significant volume of data, experiment with it, save it, return to it later.. Thanks again for these comments.\nIt makes sense that the updateable form of the sketches requires more storage space than the compressed ones. The challenge for our framework is that it supports aggregation of properies (e.g. merging of two HLL sketches), and that merging can happen a long time after the sketch was last updated. Therefore we need to be able to serialise the sketch, leave it stored in the underlying key-value store for a long period, and then at some point deserialise it, merge the new item in, and then reserialise it. Of course, this is inefficient in comparison to simply leaving the sketch in memory, but that's not always possible.\nOnce the HllSketch has been compacted, I understand that it is not possible to update it, i.e. add new strings into it. Would it be possible to take the union of 2 sketches though? i.e. to be able to do h3=h1.union(h2) where h1 and h2 are both compacted sketches? It seems that is is not possible now - is there any chance it could be possible in future? If it could then we would get the advantages of the compact serialisation and retain the ability to merge 2 sketches later.\n. @leerho Thanks again for these comments.\nWhen using sketches to estimate the degree of a node, the primary concern is compact serialisation, as there will be one sketch per node (or one per node per time window if the properties are stored keyed on some time window). The creation, update, and serialisation speed, and on-heap space, are of secondary importance. As discussed before, in a power-law graph the majority of nodes have low degree so compact serialisation for the low cardinality case is particularly important. Ideally the sketch should provide accurate estimates for both low cardinalities and high cardinalities. It's worth noting that for large-scale graphs a small sketch size might be chosen at the expense of accuracy, i.e. prioritise small serialised size over the accuracy of the sketch.\nIf the HLL implementation could be extended so that it allowed merging of the compact sketches, that would make it a lot more useful for this application. Presumably by \"advanced estimators\" you're referring to the improvements in the HyperLogLog++ paper? Look forward to seeing the improved HLL code in due course - please raise an issue here if you want us to test it.\nSet intersections using theta sketches are of interest, and are supported by our framework - theta sketches can be added to nodes or edges. But serialisers and aggregators to allow these to be used have only recently been added so it's not yet clear how widely they will be used. One use case for the theta sketches would be to understand the evolution of the graph over time. For example, maintain a theta sketch of the edges added to the graph for each day, and then perform sketch intersections to understand what proportion of edges added one day had already been added the previous day. This use case only requires one sketch to be stored per day, so serialised space is not important, but update speed would be very important as the sketch would be updated many times.. > So if merging of mixed k sketches is very common, you may as well choose space or accuracy to determine k, and stick with it for all scales.\nGenerally, the same k is used for all the sketches in an application.\n\nif your cardinality distribution is power-law, you might consider using the p-sampling option of the Theta Sketches\n\nThanks - we weren't aware of that option. We should investigate that.\n\nWe also have developed advanced estimators for the low and intermediate cardinality zones that has not yet been published (coming soon).\n\nSounds interesting - look forward to seeing the publication.. I'm going to close this issue now. Thanks for the conversation. Please re-open it if you wish to continue the discussion.. @leerho Thanks, we'll take a look soon.. Reopening so that it's easier to see the discussion is on-going.. @leerho We've briefly experimented with the new version of HLLSketch. Here are some simple observations - these mostly won't be a surprise to you:\n\nIn terms of the serialised size of HLLSketch, as the number of items added increases there's a transition point. Once at or past the transition point, the serialised size is predictable (e.g. 2^k + 40 for TgtHllType.HLL_8).\nThe point at which the transition occurs increases as k increases.\nThe estimate up to the transition point appears to be perfect.\nSerialisation size for small sets: it takes 8 bytes to store an empty HllSketch, then approximately 4 bytes per item, up to the transition point to the full sketch.\nIt is easy to merge HLLSketchs using the Union. The Union has a toByteArray method but there doesn't seem to be a way to deserialise it back from that byte array - is there a way?\nComparison with the HyperLogLogPlus class from the com.clearspring.analytics:stream library:\nAs small serialised size is more important than absolute accuracy, we compared the smallest versions of each (namely HyperLogLogPlus(4,4) with HLLSketch(7, TgtHllType.HLL_4)). Here size is the number of items added, CS=clearspring, DS=DataSketches, the number of bytes is the serialised size and the percentage error is the difference between the estimated size and the actual size:\nSize 0: CS - 8 bytes, DS - 8 bytes\nSize 2: CS - 12 bytes (0% error), DS - 16 bytes (0% error)\nSize 100000: CS - 20 bytes (0.25% error), DS - 104 bytes (12% error)\nSize 200000: CS - 20 bytes (24% error), DS - 104 bytes (0.02%)\nSize 1000000: CS - 20 bytes (34% error), DS - 104 bytes (2.6% error)\nThe size of the error from DS at size 100000 is surprisingly large, much larger than when more items are added which is odd.\nIn power-law situations, there won't be many large sets, therefore the additional size likely doesn't matter, and the additional size of small sketches (e.g. 16 bytes vs 12 bytes) may or may not matter). Is is possible to have smaller HLLSketchs than HLLSketch(7, TgtHllType.HLL_4)?\n\n\nSpeed: When adding ints to a HLL, DataSketches is ~10 times faster, when adding strings the performance is similar.\n(Minor) The Javadoc for TgtHllType explains the trade-off between speed and size well, but doesn't comment on the accuracy.\n(Minor) The constructor of HLLSketch seems to allow values outside the range the Javadoc says is allowed (e.g. new HllSketch(6) doesn't throw an exception).\n. > If you don't mind, the next time you run this, try the two sketches, both with LgK = 7.\n\nI've rerun the comparison between DataSketches and clearspring using HyperLogLogPlus(7) and HLLSketch(7, TgtHllType.HLL_4):\n\nSize 100000: CS - 96 bytes (13.5% error), DS - 104 bytes (12% error)\nSize 200000: CS - 96 bytes (7.8% error), DS - 104 bytes (0.02%)\nSize 1000000: CS - 96 bytes (3.8% error), DS - 104 bytes (2.6% error)\n\nSo DataSketches is more accurate - by a very large amount for size 200000, by a small amount for size 100000 (but as discussed the 12% error seems anomalous) and by a moderate amount at size 1000000.\n\nwould you actually use a sketch with an RSE of 25% error? Or more practically, 50% error with 95% confidence?\n\nI think there are use-cases where the sketch is used to provide an estimate of the rough order-of-magnitude of the size, i.e. it's an indication whether the size is ~100, or ~1000, or ~10000, or.... In this case a 25% error may be acceptable.\n\nFirst convert the string to a char[] and feed the char[] to the sketch.\n\nThis does indeed speed it up so that it's twice as fast as clearspring.\n. @leerho OK, a slightly more intelligent test, averaging over many trials now gives approximately 5-6% error for HllSketch(7, TgtHllType.HLL_4), and this is consistent for sets of size 100000, 200000, 1000000.\n@AlexanderSaydakov Thanks - the 12% error seemed anomalous in comparison to the other errors, but as you say it's well within expected bounds.. @leerho For info, PR https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/986 uses another sketch from your library. The PR contains properties to store sets of timestamps on nodes or edges. One of the properties allows the user to specify a maximum number of timestamps to store; if more than that number are added it uses a ReservoirLongsUnion to maintain a uniform random sample of them.. @leerho Great, we will check out the new version over the next few days.. @leerho We've looked at the new HLL, and the accuracy seems great. We're working on a serialiser and an aggregator for it so that it can be used within Gaffer graphs (issue https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1011).\nHere's a summary of the use of sketches from Data Sketches in Gaffer - there are a couple of questions in there to check we're using it in the optimal way.\nFor any sketch that we use we need to be able to serialise it to a byte array for storage. Later we need to be able to deserialise it (a) back to the sketch to obtain whatever estimates the sketch provides, (b) to merge it with another deserialised sketch. Of course this serialisation and deserialisation can be relatively expensive, but as some of our stores (e.g. the Accumulo and Hbase ones) are designed for large-scale storage, it is not always viable to leave the sketches in memory. Streaming jobs can be used to aggregate sketches over a time window before they are serialised and stored, but the requirement to deserialise them later and possibly merge with other sketches of the same type remains.\nSketch: HyperLogLog\n    Typically used to obtain quick estimates of the degree of a vertex (by putting a HyperLogLog sketch on each vertex - the HLL contains all the vertices at other ends of edges from the vertex). The com.yahoo.sketches.hll.Union class is used for this. It is serialised with the toCompactByteArray() method, deserialised with Union.heapify(bytes), and two Unions a and b are merged using a.update(b.getResult()).\n    Question: Would it be more efficient to use the static method unionImpl on Union to merge the two Unions (but this method is not public so presumably it is not intended to be used by external code)?\nSketch: ReservoirItemsUnion\n    Example use-cases: Maintain a random sample of some property on a node or edge. This is used in the BoundedTimestampSet class to maintain a random sample of the timestamps a node or edge was seen active. It could also be used to store a random sample of the neighbours of a vertex on the vertex.\n    Classes ReservoirLongsUnion and ReservoirItemsUnion are used for this. They are serialised with the toByteArray method, deserialised with heapify(WritableMemory.wrap(bytes), SERIALISER) method, and two Unions a and b are merged using a.update(b.getResult()).\n        Question: is this the best way? Should it be done with a.update(Memory.wrap(b.toByteArray()))?\nSketch: Quantiles\n    Example use-cases: Estimate the percentiles of some numerical property that is associated to a vertex or edge. \n    Classes ItemsUnion and DoublesUnion are used for this. They are serialised with union.getResult().toByteArray() method (it seems that there is no toByteArray directly on Union, unlike the reservoir sampling package?), deserialised with DoublesUnion union = DoublesUnion.builder().build();\n        union.update(WritableMemory.wrap(bytes)); and two Unions a and b are merged using a.update(b.getResult()).\nSketch: Frequencies\n    Example use-case: Estimate the frequency with which a long property is seen on a vertex or edge.\n    Classes ItemsSketch and LongsSketch are used for this. They are serialised with toByteArray(), deserialised with getInstance(WritableMemory.wrap(bytes)) and two sketches a and b are merged using a.merge(b).\nSketch: Theta\n    Example use-case: Estimate the number of distinct edges seen on Jan 1st, the number seen on Jan 2nd and the number in common between those two days.\n    Class com.yahoo.sketches.theta.Union is used for this. It is serialised with union.getResult().toByteArray(), and deserialised with Union union = Sketches.setOperationBuilder().buildUnion(); union.update(WritableMemory.wrap(bytes));, and two sketches a and b are merged using a.update(b.getResult()).\n. @leerho Thanks.\n\nSketch uses after deserialization: You mentioned (a) get estimate and (b) merging, but you didn't mention (c) continue updating the sketch. Do you ever have this 3rd use case?\n\nNo we don't generally have this 3rd use case - once a sketch has been serialised, it only changes when it is merged with another sketch that has been deserialised (normally as new data for a vertex or edge arrives, it will be serialised and later merged with older versions of that vertex/edge).\n\nIn this environment we routinely merge millions of sketches and provide sub-second query latency.\n\nThose figures are impressive. We generally merge much smaller number of sketches at query time, e.g. merging sketches associated to the same node for different time windows. Here it's only a few 10s of sketches that are being merged.\n\nThere is no UnionImpl method in the HLL Union.\n\nI was looking at the unionImpl static method on line 199 of https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-core/blob/sketches-core-0.10.0/src/main/java/com/yahoo/sketches/hll/Union.java, but you've answered my question anyway thanks.\n. @AlexanderSaydakov \nThanks for asking that question (i.e. why do we use Unions not sketches). It's a fundamental question and probably worth revisiting.\nOur main requirement is to be able to aggregate two serialised properties together, where the property is either a sketch or a union. As we use a union, to aggregate two of them a and b, we can just do\na.update(b.getResult());\n\nIf we were using sketches we would have to do something like:\nReservoirLongsUnion union = ReservoirLongsUnion.newInstance(10);\nunion.update(a);\nunion.update(b);\nReservoirLongsSketch merged = union.getResult();\n\nIn the first approach, we need to call getResult() once and update once. In the second we need to create a new Union, call update twice and then call getResult().\nAlthough we will often be merging more than two of these together (although generally only a few of these per node or vertex, not millions), the aggregation API requires the result of the aggregation to be of the same type as the things being aggregated. So when using sketches (2nd code snippet) we would have to repeatedly get the result from the union, and then create another union when the next item for the same vertex/node needed to be merged.\nThere was also some issue, which I can't remember in detail, about some of the sketches \nnot being updateable once they have been serialised to a compact form.\nIf this doesn't make sense, or you think that using Unions is the wrong approach, please let us know.. @AlexanderSaydakov \nThanks. We'll write serialisers and aggregators for both the unions and the sketches. Then users can decide which to use, and in slower time we'll do some investigation to see if there are any significant performance differences between the two approaches.. @leerho\nI've started experimenting with storing the sketches off-heap and am beginning to appreciate the power that offers. We will be interested when the HLLs support off-heap storage.. I'll close this now. Serialisers and aggregators for the new HLL sketches have been written and merged into develop. For most of the sketches from data-sketches that we support, there are serialisers and aggregators for both the sketch form and the union form. We'll update this issue in future if we decide on general guidelines for which to use.\nWe will continue to watch the development of data-sketches, and will look out for updates that increase the sketches that support off-heap storage.\nThanks for the guidance.. @leerho Thanks for the update on the HLL sketch. Look forward to seeing more documentation - more examples of how to use the off-heap approach would be very useful.\nThanks for the offer of the talk. We'll get back to you on that.. @leerho Apologies for the delay in replying - because this issue is closed I hadn't spotted your comments.\nThanks for the link to the paper of Kevin Lang and to the comparison of the Datasketches HLL with the Clearspring HLL++  - very useful.\n. Looks good - there are a couple of minor comments above.\nI'm going to raise an issue about providing an example in the documentation about how this change affects queries which have a filter that specifies the destination, e.g. if undirected edge B-A is inserted into a graph, and B is queried for, with a filter saying that the destination should be A or match A* then no results will be returned, because B is the destination. When executing such queries on undirected edges, the user should specify that either the source or the destination is A.. Can you explain this in more detail? Is it one of the examples built-in to Gaffer that is generating the invalid end date or a particular example you've found on your own data set?. Is there any reason to use Base64 from net.iharder.base64 rather than org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64 which is what is used in IngestUtils?. @p013570 Yes, looks good, but CI build is failing.. Update: this is still being reviewed. Some changes have been pushed to this branch, and there are a few more to come.. Closing for now whilst further refactoring is done to simplify the code.. I'll close this for now while I make a couple of changes:\n\nMake the main method that generates the serialised sizes a unit test.\nAdd an example for the wiki.. I'll have a detailed look at this early next week (some methods that are heavily used in the current serialisation have changed) - can we hold off merging until then, please?. Looks fine.\n\nThe only question is whether BoundedTimestampSet should have an equals() method at all - if it's in the state where it's sampling then it's using a ReservoirLongsUnion which maintains a random sample. The equals() method uses the random sample. So two BoundedTimestampSets which have had exactly the same data added might not be equal (as the random sample might be different). We could either accept this, and decide equals() means that they happened to retain exactly the same sample, or not implement equals() at all.. Not sure. Maybe the general pattern is that a store can have an optional list of enabled operations in its properties? So admins can instantiate a store with all options enabled, but the store that is used in a REST API will only have a small number of operations enabled?. If we can already provide similar functionality with the declarations file, then I don't think \"advanced\" makes sense. The only option I can think of is a \"don't enable additional operations\" option. If this is on, then you only get to use the default operations that all stores provide.. Another thought: is there any value in having a \"read-only\" mode? If this is on then you can't run any operation that changes the graph.. How do we deal with uniqueness of IDs? If I'm creating multiple graphs in the same Accumulo instance, then it is easy to check there isn't already a graph with that id (if we're using the id as the table name).\nBut what if multiple Accumulo instances are being used? Will the graph need to check with the schema registry to ensure it's not re-using an ID?. Closing while suggested changes are made.. Created ReservoirItemsSketchSerialiser and made ReservoirStringsSketchSerialiser and ReservoirNumbersSketchSerialiser extend it to reduce code duplication as requested.\nSuggest creating a separate issue to update the examples/documentation for the sketches library. The examples are currently contained in the properties guide - this could do with a better introduction to what sketches are, which libraries we use and the differences between the unions and the sketches.. You're right, it's done in the addIterators method which then calls updateConfiguration. Closing this now.. > We need to update the SchemaElementDefinition class to allow a ElementAggregator to be provided. Then getFullAggregator, getIngestAggregator and getQueryAggregator methods will need to be updated to use combine the Type aggregators and the schema element definition aggregator.\nNot sure I understand what this means. What does an ElementAggregator do? What if the type aggregators and element aggregators disagree on what to do?\nIf multiple properties need to be aggregated by one function then they could be put in one property. If you were maintaining a mean and need to update the sum and the number of items then those 2 fields could be made into one property which could then easily be aggregated with a normal aggregation function. Is there a good use-case which can't be satisfied by this approach?\nNot sure the extra complexity that this will introduce (which feels like a lot) is justified. Users already find writing a schema the hardest thing to do. Too much generality will result in a framework that is too hard to use.\nFrom #1058, \"I don't think it's a high priority. Especially if it complicates the schema config\".. OK, thanks that helps.\nWe need to decide whether our fundamental unit of aggregation is a single property or whether it can be more than 1. I tend to think that for the type of custom aggregation you're specifying it maybe should be one property as they are somehow logically related. But if they're the only properties you have then they end up nested (and the main properties map only has 1 key) which is a bit odd.\nWe'll have to see how much complexity it adds.. Can someone clarify how this relates to #1303 ?. Thanks, that makes sense.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Almost - I think it would be better for the subpackage to be called cardinality rather than hyperloglogplus, i.e. HyperLogLogPlusSerialiser should be in the package uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.clearspring.cardinality.serialisation rather than uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.clearspring.hyperloglogplus.serialisation. This is more consistent with the naming for the sketches under datasketches and it's more consistent with the internal structure of the clearspring library which has HyperLogLogPlus in a cardinality package.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Hi,\nThat does seem slow. Accumulo is not optimised for reading all the data in a table, but it still seems a bit slow. We would say that reading all the data in a large table into an RDD will be so slow as to be unusable but 20 million records is not that much. Is this an Accumulo instance with just one server? Is the total table size 20 million records?\nIs the performance ok when you're using a Spark operation like GetRDDOfElements with a seed so that it should only have to read a small amount of data that is relevant to the seed?\nWe're also working on improving the speed of Spark against Accumulo by adding an option to read Accumulo's Rfiles directly, rather than going via the tablet servers (see https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/1222). This requires the user running the Spark job to have read access to the files within the relevant table directory inside \"/accumulo\" (or wherever Accumulo is storing its data) in HDFS.. Thanks for the additional info. The total time to run the job is obviously dominated by the 3.1h which is to read the tablet with 27 million key-values. That works out as 2400 key-values read from the tablet server per second by a single Spark executor. Whether we'd expect better performance than that depends on lots of things: what networking you have, whether the tablet server has enough memory, how large the properties on the edges are, etc.\nIf you ran a compaction operation on the table then you'd get more balanced tablet sizes, and probably more tablets, which would improve the overall job time.\nI wouldn't say \"we don't recommend reading in the whole table\" - it depends on your volumes and latency requirements. Very large tables will always take a long time to read. Your table is moderate size - it should be possible to read that quickly enough to be useful (but it would always be a batch job, rather than an interactive query).\nWe expect the performance of reading the Rfiles directly to be better than the current approach but only by a factor of 2-5.\nI'd expect reading the raw csv files to be significantly faster than reading from Accumulo (but not seconds vs several hours).\nWe also have a Parquet store which is more designed to allow operations like GetRDDOfAllElements to run quickly - once the data is loaded in it is basically just reading the Parquet files directly from Spark. This store is still experimental - if you do use it please let us know how you get on.\nWe will do some performance tests of GetAllRDDOfElements to see what level of performance is normal.\nYour 8 million results from using GetRDDOfElements for a single vertex is a lot! Using the standard Java API we easily get sub-second response for retrieving all the edges for a vertex when the vertex has a small (maybe up to thousands) number of edges. The Spark API might be a little slower as there is a small amount of overhead in starting executors. If there are 8 million edges then it could easily take a few minutes to return those. It shouldn't take 41 minutes though unless your tablet servers are under-resourced or there is some other bottleneck.. Also see #1245: There is a bug with the GetRDDOfAllElements operation which means every edge is returned twice (each edge is stored twice in the Accumulo table so it can be found from either end), so the Spark executors are receiving twice as much data as they should. The GetAllElements operation in the standard Java API automatically makes sure it only returns each edge once.\nIt's not clear whether you'll get a 2x performance improvement when this bug is fixed - it depends whether the bottleneck is the networking between your Spark executor and the tablet server, or IO from your tablet server to the files or CPU in the tablet server.. >I did notice that the IP of the spark task executor rarely matches the IP of the accumulo tablet server it's reading from.\nThat's odd. You should get locality most of the time. I don't know why that is happening. It won't help the performance and as noted above without more information on the networking on the EC2 instances it's hard to know if network bandwidth is the limitation.\n\nThe tablet server jvms each are allocated 2G max\n\nThat's a bit small. It would be worth increasing it if possible.\n\nI haven't aggregated on ingest so each edge is an event - which explains the 8 million result for a single vertex. I've tried to pinpoint exactly where the slow parts are (because the bad performance seemed to follow the data) and the scan rate slows dramatically when it is reading the millions of edges between the same vertices. Do you think it could be because the row id would be the same for all of those millions of edges?\n\nI think if your schema is not doing aggregation and your data has millions of edges between the same 2 vertices then that will explain the unbalanced tablet sizes and that could explain the poor performance. The fact that the row id will be the same means that all the edges will be in the same tablet, so that work can't be parallelised.\nWe'd encourage you to think about using aggregation to replace the 8 million edges between the same 2 nodes with a summarised version. This could significantly reduce the data volumes.\nIf you can share your schema and generators for converting the raw data to elements, it's possible we could try the same experiments you're doing to see what the performance is.. Excellent.\nWhen you say \"using a batch scanner\" can you clarify what you mean? Which operation were you using and what were the options?. @supamanda Thanks for this. We have the setBatchScan option on for GetRDDOfElementsHandler and GetJavaRDDOfElementsHandler, but not on for GetRDDOfAllElements as we believed that the batch scan option improved performance for range scans but not for full scans. If you have figures saying that it helps for GetRDDOfAllElements then we should change that, or at least make it an option.. Apologies for the delay in responding.\nYou're right, there is a bug. Serialising the byte array to a string as it is currently done isn't safe. I'll change it to base 64 encode the byte array and use that as the string.\nThanks for finding the bug.. Looking at the current branch for this, I think more discussion is needed as to what we're trying to achieve and the design.\n\nThe operation should not be called Path. It should be called GetPaths and should return Paths.\nWe need a Path class that can be used to store a path through the graph. A Path is more than just an Iterable of Edges as there is a guarantee that one of the vertices in the next edge is the same as one of the vertices in the current Edge. The Path class should enforce this constraint when it is created.\nAre we going to use the MatchedVertex field in a Path to identify which end of the edge was either the seed (if it's the first edge) or appeared in the previous edge (if it's not the first edge)? If so the Path class should enforce this.\nWhat Paths are valid? Is A->B->A valid? Is A->B->A->C valid? Is A->B->A->B valid?\nA Path class could include just Edges, or include both Entities and Edges. We should allow the user to decide which they want. This would then mean that the GetPath operation with only 1 hop could return Entitys for the seed vertex, Edges and then Entitys for the destination vertex (currently users have to manually query to find the properties of vertices at the other end of a hop).\nCreating multiple GetElements operations as the input to the operation gives maximum flexibility to the user but is complicated if all you want to do is run multiple GetEdges. There could be another operation called GetNHopPaths which did this automatically.. Thanks. The other advantage of having a Path object is that it can have methods to return the vertex at \"distance\" N from the original seed. This avoids the user having to iterate through the list of Edges until N have been consumed and then use MatchedVertex to find the actual distance N vertex.\n\nIt might be worth thinking if there is some object that wraps an Iterable of Paths that would support methods like getVerticesAtDistance(n) - that could then be used to return all vertices at distance N from some seeds.. We should be careful about whether our Path object is actually a trail or a walk: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory).\nIn a directed graph A->B->C there is a path A->B->C but there is no path C<-B<-A. But with the current proposed implementation of this operation, C<-B<-A would be returned as path from the seed C.\nWe need to:\n- Be clear about whether we're creating walks, trails, or paths.\n- Be clear whether we're treating the graph as undirected (so that C-B-A is a valid path in the above example) or respecting the edge directions (so that it isn't a valid path).. The way this should work is:\n\nValidation should be applied to all elements when new data is added (as all the data has to be read anyway) - this should be optional though in case your application knows for sure that no invalid data has been added.\nThere should be a RemoveInvalidElements operation that reprocesses the entire graph and removes invalid elements.\n\nAll queries against the Parquet store should have an optional option to validate the data before it is returned. There are scenarios where you know there isn't any invalid data, e.g. you do a nightly update to the graph which adds new data and removes old data and you then know that all queries that run in the next 24 hours won't see any invalid data (because all the data in the graph is now valid for the next 24 hours). In this case you want to avoid the expense of validation (the additional expense of doing validation could be very high if you're getting a data frame and then only reading one column - doing validation may require reading all the columns, converting to a Java Element object and applying a predicate).. Merged into develop.. Before this is merged can someone comment on the question raised in the issue about how this relates to #1303 ?. An initial attempt to unit test this using the following code in GetRDDOfElementsHandlerTest fails - the value set on the configuration isn't present in the configuration obtained from the RDD:\n@Test\npublic void checkHadoopConfIsPassedThrough() throws OperationException, IOException {\n    final Graph graph1 = new Graph.Builder()\n            .config(new GraphConfig.Builder()\n                    .graphId(\"graphId\")\n                    .build())\n            .addSchema(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"/schema/elements.json\"))\n            .addSchema(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"/schema/types.json\"))\n            .addSchema(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"/schema/serialisation.json\"))\n            .storeProperties(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"/store.properties\"))\n            .build();\n    final User user = new User();\n    final SparkSession sparkSession = SparkSessionProvider.getSparkSession();\n    final Configuration conf = new Configuration();\n    conf.set(\"AN_OPTION\", \"A_VALUE\");\n    final String encodedConf = AbstractGetRDDHandler.convertConfigurationToString(conf);\n    final GetRDDOfElements rddQuery = new GetRDDOfElements.Builder()\n            .input(new EdgeSeed(\"1\", \"B\", false))\n            .sparkSession(sparkSession)\n            .option(AbstractGetRDDHandler.HADOOP_CONFIGURATION_KEY, encodedConf)\n            .build();\n    final RDD rdd = graph1.execute(rddQuery, user);\nassertEquals(\"A_VALUE\", rdd.sparkContext().hadoopConfiguration().get(\"AN_OPTION\"));\n\n}. The intention for the GetElements operation was that seeds have to be provided (i.e. not null, and if null is passed in then an exception is thrown), but if an empty set of seeds is passed in then an empty set of results is returned (it's quite common to query for an empty set of seeds if doing a breadth-first search expansion around a node and the next frontier is empty because you've already touched all the nodes in the component).. I think this also needs fixing in GetRDDOfAllElementsHandler. And the issue also asks for the GetDataFrameOfElementsHandler class to pass the option containing the encoded Configuration on to the operations that return the RDD.. It depends what \"remove the property\" means. If it means that the property should never be returned from a query then the above approach works. If it means that the property should actually be removed from the store, then the above won't work, e.g. in the AccumuloStore key-values may not be deserialised and reserialised in a major compaction (if there is a validation filter then they will be deserialised but not reserialised) so the values of the property will persist in the store indefinitely. To deal with this a new operation would be required.\n\n\n@javadev001001 Can you confirm whether the requirements is for the first case, the second or both? . Merged into develop.. Is there any difference between a bi-directional edge and an undirected edge? Are there any domains where you would want to have an undirected edge and a bi-directed edge in the same graph? e.g. in a road network graph you would use directed edges for one-way streets and undirected edges for two-way streets.. Looks good.. This new key package should be significantly better than either of the current two key packages. It should be the default key package in version 2.0.. Reopening - no explanation of why the 'invalid' label was added or why the issue was closed.. Reopening - no explanation of why the 'invalid' label was added or why the issue was closed.. I don't think there's any need for an option to set the number of reducers. It's best to use one reducer for each tablet, and this should be the default. Early versions of Gaffer didn't have the option to set the number of reducers, and this was based on Accumulo's recommended approach.\nThe times that isn't the best idea are described in the documentation, quoted below. Suggest we remove (or deprecate) the option to set the number of reducers.\nIf there's believed to be a bug in the logic for using the minimum and maximum numbers, then can this be explained here, as it was tested fairly carefully when it was added.\n\nBy default the number of reducers used in the MapReduce job that converts data into the correct form is the same as the number of tablets. There are at least two scenarios where this is not ideal. First, if a large amount of data is being added into a table with a small number of tablets, then the number of reducers will be too small (i.e. each reducer will have a very large amount of work to do). Second, if a small amount of data is being added into a table with a large number of tablets, then the number of reducers will be too great, and there will be a large amount of unnecessary task creation. There are two options on the AddElementsFromHdfs operation that can be used to set the minimum and maximum number of reducers that are used in the MapReduce job. This bug was fixed during the major rewrite of the Parquet store in #1884 .. Do we need an issue about to gaffer-doc to improve the documentation of min and max there, and note that setting the number of reducers has been deprecated?. I've made a couple of minor comments.\n\nMain comment is how are the list of split points applied to a table? There is a SplitStore operation but that takes a path to a file of split points, whereas the new operation added here outputs a list of split points. Is the intention that the split points will be written to file and then read by the SplitStore operation? Should we add the ability to split a store directly from a list of split points?. This bug was fixed during the major rewrite of the Parquet store in #1884.. The timestamp isn't necessary. Specifying the timestamp as the startTime causes the same records to be deduped in Accumulo as you found. We'd recommend not using the timestamp (using it in situations where it is safe to do so might cause very minor performance benefits).\nIf by \"default timestamp\" you mean not specifying the timestamp field then that is odd, as that should work. The following code shows how the same edge will appear multiple times in the data if no aggregation is specified:\nSchema schema = new Schema.Builder()\n            .type(\"timestamp\", new TypeDefinition.Builder()\n                    .clazz(Long.class)\n                    .build())\n            .type(\"string\", new TypeDefinition.Builder()\n                    .clazz(String.class)\n                    .build())\n            .type(\"boolean\", Boolean.class)\n            .edge(\"EDGE\", new SchemaEdgeDefinition.Builder()\n                    .source(\"string\")\n                    .destination(\"string\")\n                    .directed(\"boolean\")\n                    .property(\"p\", \"timestamp\")\n                    .aggregate(false)\n                .build())\n            .build();\n\n    AccumuloProperties properties = new AccumuloProperties();\n    properties.setStoreClass(SingleUseMockAccumuloStore.class.getName());\n\n    Graph graph = new Graph.Builder()\n            .config(new GraphConfig.Builder().graphId(\"test\").build())\n            .addSchema(schema)\n            .storeProperties(properties)\n            .build();\n    Edge edge = new Edge.Builder()\n            .source(\"A\")\n            .dest(\"B\")\n            .group(\"EDGE\")\n            .property(\"p\", 1L)\n            .build();\n\n    List<Element> elementList = new ArrayList<Element>();\n    elementList.add(edge);\n    elementList.add(edge);\n\n    AddElements add = new AddElements.Builder().input(elementList).build();\n\n    graph.execute(add, new User());\n\n    GetAllElements g = new GetAllElements.Builder().build();\n    CloseableIterable<? extends Element> res = graph.execute(g, new User());\n    for (Element e : res) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n\nThis returns:\nEdge[source=A,destination=B,directed=false,group=EDGE,properties=Properties[p=<java.lang.Long>1]]\nEdge[source=A,destination=B,directed=false,group=EDGE,properties=Properties[p=<java.lang.Long>1]]\n\nCan you share your schema?. Which version of Accumulo are you using? Some versions of Accumulo have a bug where bulk imports can lose data.. Where are you getting the ingest counts from? From running a GetAllElements and counting, or from the Accumulo web page, or via a Spark job?. I don't know why the Schema allows a timestampProperty to be set. It can't be taken advantage of using any of the query APIs (unlike say the visibility property which is a key part of queries). If it can be specified then it should be a store property - a store could for some reason require some particular value to be provided when ingesting and could offer options for getting that from a property, or specifying a random generator.\nSo vote we deprecate the timestampProperty in the schema.. If the timestamp becomes part of the store properties then that ties them to a schema, if it specifies that the timestamp should be set to a property (it could specify a class to be used to generate the timestamp, e.g. randomly, in which case it wouldn't be tied to a schema).\nIf the property goes in a config option in the schema, then that ties the schema to a particular store type.\nEither option has problems. But the config option may be best.. Are there any situations in which you might want to apply query time aggregation to a group which is marked as not requiring ingest aggregation? The schema still requires aggregators to be provided for all properties, which is strange if properties in non-aggregation groups can't be aggregated.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. A note on the migration steps has been added to the issue.\nI haven't listed the packages that need to be renamed as the renamed ones are only internal to the Parquet store; clients of the Parquet store shouldn't be using these classes directly.. Issue #1760 created for JSON serialisation.. Version of datasketches updated in NOTICES file.. Just to note that:\n\nYes, an in range predicate would be useful for the timestamp sets\nBut these could have various meanings, e.g. at least one of the timestamps is in the range, or all of the timestamps are in the range. We'd need to allow the predicate to be configured with these different meanings.. Merged into develop.. In an undirected edge between a string and an int, there's no guarantee that say the source will always be the string, and the destination will always be the int. They may be flipped around based on their order.\n\nHow will we know which serialiser to use for the source?. Don't think this is the right way to do it.\n\nThis consumes the entire iterable of elements to be added to check whether the groups are in the schema - it then needs to be consumed again to add the elements - this is very expensive and there's no guarantee that the iterable can be consumed twice.\nIt iterates through all the elements and if any one has a group in the schema then it says it's fine and will then attempt to add all the elements - you'll still get a NPE if one of the elements has a group that's in the schema and one doesn't.\n\nThe check that the group is valid needs to be done per element just before the element is added - if the group is not in the schema then a warning should be logged.. This bug is due to a fundamental problem with the partitioning of data in the Parquet store. Fixing this requires significant changes. Data that is currently stored in the Parquet store will not work in the fixed version. Further work on the Parquet store should wait until this issue is fixed. . This bug was fixed during the major rewrite of the Parquet store in https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1884 .. If all the vertices and source and destinations are the same type, will a MultiSerialiser still be used? That seems wasteful. If they're all a string, we should just use a string serialiser.. I still think that using a MultiSerialiser by default in the case that the vertex, source and destination are all a string or all a long is unnecessary. It may only be 1 additional byte, but that's a very high overhead in the case of a long.. For undirected edges, the src and dst are compared (using the compare method if they're comparable, or based on toString if not) and the src set to the first to ensure a consistent representation. This is intentional behaviour.\nWhat is this issue suggesting needs to be done?. This is a breaking change - anyone with a schema with undirected edges with different types at the end will find that their schema no longer works.\nI guess the point is that that didn't work anyway in a store that did serialisation because if the edge got flipped then it wouldn't know which serialiser to use, but the issue doesn't actually say that. And it could have worked if the user had allowed for it in their serialiser, so that does make it a breaking change.\nAn alternative solution would be to identify the case that where the schema says the edge is undirected but the source and destination types are different and automatically use a serialiser that included the type of the vertex and then delegated to the user's serialiser.\nWe seem to have limited the schema purely for the convenience of the MultiSerialiser.. > It\u2019s not possible for any user to currently be creating \u201cundirected edges with different vertex types\u201d\nI think it is possible. The following code which creates an undirected edge from a string to an integer works fine:\n Edge e = new Edge.Builder().source(\"A\").dest(1).directed(false).build();\n\nThe errors you post are only from a schema that contains validation that the source is a String and the destination is an integer. If the edge is undirected you shouldn't be doing that validation as they may get flipped so that the ordering is consistent.. >So the row key 1\"a\"U will be turned into src:1 dest:\"a\" which is against the schema, src:string dest:long\nIt's not against the schema. If the edge is undirected, then saying in the schema that the source is a string and the destination is an integer is only saying that one of the vertices is a string and one is an integer. There isn't really a source and a destination in an undirected edge. The getSource() and getDestination() methods on an undirected edge are just ways of returning the 2 vertices, there isn't really a source and a destination.\nWe don't need to retain information in the key package about whether an undirected edge has been flipped, as the flipping is irrelevant. The constructor takes care of deciding which one is the source and which is the destination, by comparing them however it can. This is a convenience method so that representations of undirected edges from toString() or as JSON will always be consistent (if we don't ensure they're ordered then undirected edge A-B would appear different to undirected edge B-A when printed using toString() or converted to JSON - this causes problems for downstream systems).. My original comment on this issue was that there is no issue. It's working as intended. I haven't seen anything above to change that.\nThe only possible issue is that if you have different vertex types for source and destination in an undirected edge then we may use the wrong serialiser, e.g. if the source is a string and the destination is an integer, then if they're flipped when an edge is created, we may try to use a string serialiser for the integer. There are a few possible solutions:\n\nLeave it as is and document that if you use different types in undirected edges your serialiser has to deal with that, or else it breaks;\nNot allow schemas with different types for the source and destination in undirected edges (but I'm not sure we can do that - the directed field is just a type and we may not know when that is always false);\n\nSpot situations where the serialiser for the source and destination in an undirected edge are different and automatically add information to the serialisation that specifies which was used.. In the PR that's been merged for this, what does the line\nif (!srcClazz.equals(dstClazz) && !Boolean.valueOf(edgeDef.getDirected())) \n\n\nactually achieve? edgeDef.getDirected() returns the name of the type, not the class so testing Boolean.valueOf(edgeDef.getDirected()) is true doesn't achieve anything.\nIn the test shouldValidateEdgeWithDifferentVertexDirectionTrue, if you change the name of the type from \"true\" to \"myTrue\" then it fails and says it's invalid, even though we don't know it's an undirected edge. All we know is that the type of the directed field is called \"myTrue\" and is a Boolean. It may always be true and the edge may be directed.. That's a bug in the automatic validation then. It's a valid edge and it should be possible to add it to a graph. That doesn't change any of the other arguments. . > Otherwise later validation is going to fail.\nWhat later validation? There shouldn't be any validation that assumes that the string is the source and the int is the destination in the case of an undirected edge.\n\nIn accumulo these will aggregate together and be displayed as src:a dest:b\n\nThey won't necessarily be aggregated together.\n\ninput (1,a) will fail validation and not make it to store because it's not legal \n\nIt is legal. If it's not the validation is wrong.\n\nSo currently (the recent change) direction was being enforced for different vertex types...\n\nAs noted above, the recent change (the one merged in the PR for this issue) doesn't enforce that.. > Are you saying that you believe that creating and undirected Edge(1,\"a\",group1) and adding it to a graph with a schema that is expecting undirected edge(String,Int,group1) should be legal and the graph should accept it and all validation should pass?\nYes, undirected edge 1-\"A\" is equal to undirected edge \"A\"-1 (that's what undirected means). So they're both valid. We need to change the validation of undirected edges so that both are valid.\n\nrow1 scr:a dest:b\nand\nrow2 src:a dest:b won't be aggregated together?\n\nThey're only aggregated if the group specifies aggregation.\n\norderVertices() and possibly KeyPackage changed\n\nI don't see any need to change either of these.. Summary:\n\nWe need to reverse the PR that was merged for this - it doesn't achieve what it was intended to.\nThere's a bug in the validation for undirected edges. If the schema says that the source is a string and the destination is an integer, then undirected edge \"A\"-1 is valid and undirected edge 1-\"A\" is valid.\nIf the user specifies the source is a string and the destination is an integer, and they specify different serialisers for those, then there may be issues serialising / deserialising. Options:\nLeave it as is and document that if you use different types in undirected edges your serialiser has to deal with that, or else it breaks;\nNot allow schemas with different types for the source and destination in undirected edges (but I'm not sure we can do that - the directed field is just a type and we may not know when that is always false);\nSpot situations where the serialiser for the source and destination in an undirected edge are different and automatically add information to the serialisation that specifies which was used (but again we can't always tell from the schema whether an edge could be undirected - it could be of type \"myBooleanType\" which is of class Boolean and not have any validation logic - then we don't know whether it's undirected or not).. The vertices in the schema cannot be reordered as the schema does not tell us whether an edge is undirected. The schema might tell us this if the user specifies the validation logic but they may not specify any validation logic at all so we will not know whether the edge is undirected (and it's possible to have directed and undirected edges for the same group).\n\nSomething to think about for version 2.0: I don't know why the schema accepts a type for the directed field. There are only 3 possibilities: every edge in that group is directed, every edge is undirected, or there is a mixture. It could just be an enum. I'll raise an issue for this.. Closing for now.. Should this be about joining iterables (which are possibly unlimited) or about lists? If it's about joining iterables then you need standard streaming functionality such as windowing functions to deal with the possibly unlimited stream of data. I assume that's not going to be implemented. If we're going to read all the data in before outputting any results then I'd prefer to make that clear from the signature of the operation and force the user to turn the inputs into fully in-memory data sets before trying to join them.. Merged into develop.\nNote this is a breaking change for the Parquet store (the store is marked as experimental so breaking changes are allowed).. Closing whilst fix failing tests.. @d21211122 Should #1865 be updated then to say what the correct approach is? It implies that a Regex predicate is needed but as you say that already exists in Koryphe. So we just need a FreqMapKeyFilter class which accepts a predicate.. Failed due to tests taking longer than 45 minutes. Closing for now.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. That's not changed in this PR though. If we want to do that then that should be a separate issue.\nIt is a long method but in this case I think breaking it out into smaller methods makes it harder to understand and maintain.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Approved, apart from I think it's better to leave the separate paragraphs in the Javadoc for MapImpl - see suggestions..

No, no problem. There's just a backlog of things that need merging. This has built up as release 1.8 is being prepared. We'll get the open PRs merged once that release has been done.\nThanks for your contribution.. Added vote-required label to indicate this will need at least 2 committers to review.. Can you use this PR as the starting point for these fixes? https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/2059/files\nThat will help avoid unnecessary work updating that PR.. This was forked from PR #2059. Once that has been merged, this PR will show that only the README changed. . This could be final, and might be better named numEdgeGroups?\n. This could be final, and might be better named numEntityGroups?\n. The only difference here is that a space has been added at the start of the line - it should be deleted.\n. Does this actually aggregate over column visibility as well? If so, should the name reflect that?\n. Unnecessary and inconsistent empty line.\n. Could be final.\n. Could be final.\n.

Should be serialisedSet not serialiedSet.\n. Should be serialisedSet not serialiedSet.\n. Is it worth adding -DskipTests to this line to speed it up?\n. Sentence starts twice: \"and the rest api is at The ui can then be accessed\".\n. Should say A <code>CollectionContains</code>. Can this be written as \"Unable to clone a HyperLogLogPlus object\".. Should be \"final IOException e\" to be consistent with other parts of the code.. Should be \"final CardinalityMergeException e\" to be consistent with other parts of the code.. Can we be more precise here? It should say \"This example demonstrates how storing a HyperLogLogPlus object on each vertex in a graph allows us to quickly estimate its degree (i.e. the number of edges it is involved in). The estimate can be obtained without scanning through all the edges involving a node and so is very quick, even if the degree is very large.\". Think it's best to remove the word \"data\" from this line.. Method should be called shouldNotBeEqual.... Method should be called shouldNotBeEqual.... Would it be better to test to see if they're both comparable, and if so, cast them to comparable and use their natural ordering? That way if the vertices are ints or longs they will sort in a more natural order (with the source less than the destination preferably).. Is it worth adding a test that edge1.getSource equals edge2.getSource? The test of the toString() method partly tests that but it might be better to test it explicitly.. Above 4 lines should be final.. Should be final.. Should be final.. 4 variables above should be final.. Seems to be a repeat of code from ImportKeyValueJavaPairRDDToAccumuloHandler ? Can it be moved to a utils class?. 3 variables above should be final.. Above 2 lines should be final.. Add final. Replace with return tuples.listIterator(). Few lines above should be final.. 2 finals above.. final. final. Above 3 lines should be final.. Need space after if. Add final. Above 2 lines should be final.. Space after if. final. final. 4 lines above should be final.. Add final. 2 finals. 3 finals above. 2 finals. Space before implements. Delete empty line. Delete empty line. Delete empty line. This should say GetAdjacentIds and it should be \"A\" not \"An\".. \"vertices\" should be \"vertex.\". That would be great. Or I can update this once that one is merged in.. Yes, good spot.. Could this be improved if we made the properties field in Element protected? It seems a bit inefficient to have to put each property into the properties map twice (once in the builder and once here).. These 2 lines are the same. Was the intention that the first line counted the number of unique values of the source and the second line counted the number of destinations?. See above comment.. There's a possibility here that there will be collisions - 2 elements that hash to the same int. It's unlikely for small numbers of inserts, but not impossible. Ideally we'd avoid this.. Could this approach be replaced by:\n- Using the MapStore to store and aggregate elements that need aggregating. Once the MapStore reaches a certain size the whole lot could be written to HBase.\n- For elements that don't need aggregation, a dummy few bytes (say 4 bytes long and just a simple counter) could be added to the end of the column qualifier. This would ensure unique values. Whenever a key-value corresponding to a group that doesn't need aggregation is deserialised those bytes would need to be removed.. In the AccumuloStore this is done in batches. There's nothing to say that the iterable of ids fits into memory. The API is designed to allow querying for arbitrarily large iterables of ids, returning arbitrarily large numbers of results.\nHappy for this to stay as it is for now, and for this improvement to be suggested in an issue.. Does the option OPERATION_RETURN_MATCHED_SEEDS_AS_EDGE_SOURCE work now that the source and destination can be flipped by the creation of the undirected edge?. Yes, that would be another way of doing it - I didn't make it at a test because it's not core functionality, but it could be done as a test.. Needs a space after for. Should be final - can we throw an exception if the key is not a string?. Should be final. Should be catch (final IOException e) - space after catch and add final. final missing in the parameters for methods in this class. The original is more correct - it should be Overlapping. Would this be better as this?\nnew byte[(2 * bytes.length) + ((appendAfterEscaping == null) ? 0 : appendAfterEscaping.length))];\nThe maximum length that temp can be is twice as long as bytes, plus the length of appendAfterEscaping. If bytes is 10 long and appendAfterEscaping is 5 long then the code in the PR creates a temp array of length 2 * (10 + 5) = 30, whereas this suggestion creates a temp array of length 25, which will be a bit cheaper.. The line int currentPosition = 0; is superflous, as the value is immediately changed on the next line.. (Minor) This line could spread over two lines - it's too wide as it is.. Delete the \"Created on ...\" bit and add some Javadoc.. Should be 2017. Delete this Javadoc. Delete this Javadoc. Delete this Javadoc. Can this be split over multiple lines?. It's convention to use final here, i.e. catch (final NullPointerException e). Should be catch (final ...). Shouldn't this be return length == 1 && TRUE == allBytes[offset] ?. Minor - Should be \"A\" not \"An\". Should this be taken from an option on the operation? Putting split points from a table of data which has visibilities to protect the data into /tmp could be unsecure.. 'you' should be 'your'. There shouldn't be a new line after 'should'.. Is the test in the if necessary (a couple of lines above this snippet)? The elementClone.copyProperties method just iterates through the provided properties and adds them. The for loop in the else code does the same thing. Either way the result is the same - only properties from elementDef get added (which is the right thing to do). Comparing two sets to see if they're the same is possibly a bit expensive (and this method will be called a lot).. The original design tried to minimise the number of map look-ups that needed to be made before an element could be aggregated into the existing data. The element in the Map<Element, Properties> elementToProperties contained the group so only 1 look-up was needed. Now 2 are needed - 1 to get the right map for the group, and another to get the properties for the element. As the first look-up is always a local one (in a Java HashMap) the performance difference probably isn't worth worrying about, but is there any advantage in having the group as a key?\nThe Javadoc above this line needs updating as well.. Think it's best to replace Integer by Long.. MAP_NAMES and MULTI_MAP_NAMES aren't used anywhere - are they necessary?. \"If I a do\" - remove \"a\". Not sure this can be marked as Serializable as there's no guarantee that F and S are Serializable. Can you use a custom pair class?. The issue doesn't say to remove the handler for ImportRDDOfElements and replace it by ImportJavaRDDOfElements. Can both be handled?. Add Javadoc. Don't want the expense of computing the Schema from the JSON every time this method is called. As Schema isn't Serializable, it can't just be made a field of the class. It needs to be created by an init() method and the field marked as transient.. This class isn't used anywhere.. Don't add a new line in the middle of the sentence.. No new line.\nThis needs some explanation - readers won't understand what \"filter tree\" you're referring to.. No new line.. Can you give an example?. Remove commented out lines.. Remove commented out lines.. Add final. Maybe use the default compression?. Can you use a more meaningful variable name than x?. Shouldn't this be GenerateIndexedColumnSortedData.class?. final String tempFileDir - should be on a separate line.. The */ should be on its own line.. Can you use a temp folder as other tests that need to write to file do?. This parameter (numOfFilesPerGroup) isn't used anywhere.. This variable isn't used.. This variable isn't used.. comparision should be comparison.. Those 4 at the end of the line should be deleted.. The above 4 variables should start with a lower-case 'e'.. The above 4 variables should start with a lower-case 'e'.. Lower-case 'g'. The code inside this 'if' statement is almost identical to the code in the 'if' statement above - can you refactor it into a separate method and re-use?. Debateable. We don't provide any way for users to delete data (removal of data that is invalid isn't deletion of data in the sense the javadoc means). But they could manually delete table from the table. I'll add it in to be safe.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Separate issue opened: #1248 . Added in. This was also not implemented in theElementInputFormatapproach. Fixed in both and a test added.. It doesn't need to be Serializable so I've removed \"implements Serializable\".. Is there any reason for the odd placement of these brackets?. \"unexpeveed\" should be \"unexpected\". Can the bubble under the 'a' be moved a bit lower? I know it's like that in the png version but here it looks like the bubble is part of the 'a' which is confusing.. This looks like debug code?. This looks like an old comment.. This looks like an old comment.. Would it be better to actually run a GetDataFrameOfElements operation, rather than manually create the AccumuloStoreRelation? The approach here seems a bit more brittle.. This line should be commented - it's not clear why it's necessary.. \"all of the paths\" should be \"all of the walks\". This should be changed back to Path. This should be changed back to Path. This should be changed back to Path. This should be changed back to Path. It looks like theIterableresultswill be consumed twice causing the same edges to be pulled back from the database twice. Can this be avoided? The results are being cached in memory anyway. Mayberesultsshould be cached?. 'allow' should be 'allowed'. Should be final I think. Pedantic but should be \"region servers\" not \"tablet servers\". \"to\" should be \"too\". \"Flink\" not \"flink\" to be consistent. \"Kafka\" not \"kafka\". This can be replaced byreturn randomVal | time << 32`, and the whole of the method below can be deleted.. I'm not sure we need to say this. If you're ingesting the same elements from the same JVM then it's the same instance of SplittableRandom being used and this doesn't give repeated elements until at least 2^64 applications. We're using nextInt not nextLong so the chance of a repeat is higher but still very low.\nIf you're ingesting elements from different JVMs then different instances of SplittableRandom are used but the default constuctor of that says it varies \"across program invocations\".\nI would replace the end of this paragraph with \"If you don't set the timestamp values then HBase will attempt to create a unique timestamp value. This value is created from a combination of the current time and a randomly generated number. The chances of this not being unique are negligible.\"\n. Should this say \"then the time when the conversion to an Hbase Cell happens, mixed with a random number, is used\"?. Can we have a final else to log the fact that the element is ignored if it's not in schema - probably DEBUG level logging?. Can we have one more test to cover the case when one element is not in the schema, and one is in the schema - in this case the one that is in the schema should still be added.. So it is, ignore my comment.. Very minor, but should probably just add these properties to groupByProperties - a set is created at the top of the class so no need to create another one.. Maybe add all these to the existing set? It's safer as then the set won't change if the caller of this constructor changes the set.. This comment looks wrong.. Same comment as above.. Oh yes, you need to create a list before you can add it so not worth it - just thought creating another set was unnecessary.. suggestion\n * <p>This class can be thought of as an analogue to a conventional database. Internally,. suggestion\n * <p>The internal variables of this class are package-private. This allows operation. It's not, but in fixing this issue I found it useful to log that so left it in. I don't see any harm in adding it in this issue.. There already are unit tests that the process works, and those still pass. The issue only happens when speculative execution causes multiple attempts of the same task on the same partition. I don't see how it's possible to unit test that scenario. (The title of this PR is misleading - changing the name of the file to include the attempt id is just part of the solution, not the point of the PR). But it is probably possible to test two manual attempts to process the same partition and check that only one works - I'll add that.. Yes, renaming them is critical to fixing the issue. A unique filename needs to initially be created for each call of the function to avoid the failed to create file error but then the result needs to be renamed to the correct file name. Whichever call of the function renames it first wins, other calls just don't do the rename.. ",

Hmm.  There's a lot of speculation in this thread as to the reasons GCHQ isn't doing the work in the open in the first place.  Only @gaffer01 can say for sure which reasons are correct and which aren't, but if it were just a matter of code having to be audited before being published, the usual method for solving that -- a method that continues to work after publication -- is to have a dedicated branch for pre-audit code, and keep that branch only in internal repositories.  As soon as changes are approved, they can go to out to the public repository (on whatever branch is appropriate, presumably master).  Git makes this pretty easy; I have worked on projects that published to two repositories and it was fine.  One can set up hooks (\"triggers\" I guess git calls them) to make sure changes don't get published in the wrong repository just because someone made a typo when pushing, obviously.\n@foxx and @SamMorrowDrums: As to whether GCHQ should be working more collaboratively, that's a separate question from publication, and I don't think we know enough to say whether they should be more collaborative or not.  It's not all upside, after all -- they might have good reasons for choosing one side of that tradeoff instead of the other.\nMore generally, I think there's often a mistaken impression that \"open source\" equals \"collaborative development methodology\".  The two don't always go together, and that's okay.  The only thing open source is definitely about is users' freedom to copy, customize, and redistribute the software as they see fit.  Whether a broadly collaborative development model makes sense for a particular project is a complicated question, and involves many more factors than just the license the software is under.\nSo I'm not making any assumptions about what reasons GCHQ has for not open-sourcing their code from Day One, nor about whether they should try for a more collaborative style of development.  However, I am emphasizing to @gaffer01 that one can put stuff in a public place starting from the earliest stages of development, without being under any obligation to change one's development methodology by taking on more collaborators.  While the latter would require the former, the former does not force the latter.\n. Thanks, @gaffer01.  Looking forward to seeing it.\n. ",

Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop.\n. ### Migration Steps\nThe Accumulo AgeOff filter has been removed and replaced with store validation. The property accumulo.ageOffTimeInDays is no longer used. The schema validation functions you specify are now used to continually validate and remove invalid elements. This allows for custom expiration of elements as well as standard age off. \nIf you were making use of the automatic Accumulo AgeOff filter then next time you create a new table it will no longer be added - instead a validator filter is added. \nInstead ensure each element group that you wish to be aged off has a timestamp property with a type similar to \"timestamp\", then in the types section add something similar to the following:\njson\n\"timestamp\": {\n    \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n    \"validateFunctions\":  [\n      {\n        \"function\": {\n          \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.AgeOff\",\n          \"ageOffDays\": 365\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n}\nTo migrate to the new validator filter on an existing table do the following:\n- Open the accumulo shell and remove the AgeOff iterator.\n- Assemble a jar containing the main class AddUpdateTableIterator and any other functions or serialisers you are using in your schemas.\n- Then run the AddUpdateTableIterator jar on accumulo with your new schema paths, property path and the 'update' argument.\n. I'm going to close this as it is unlikely we will ever change the serialisation. Instead of trying to create a HyperLogLogPlus object in json you should consider writing the logic in Java and using an ElementGenerator or ObjectGenerator operation.. It is actually quite simple to allow new HyperLogLogPlus objects to be created from son, by adding optional 'p', 'sp' and 'offers' fields. For example you could create a new HyperLogLogPlus object by doing:\njson\n{\n  \"p\": 30, \n  \"sp\": 30, \n  \"offers\": [\"value1\", \"value2\", \"value3\"]\n}\nThis will be a simple change to the deserialisation logic. The way it is serialised into json will not change, these new fields will not be outputted into json so it will be backwards compatible.. ### Migration Steps\nSchemas can now be written in 1 file - DataSchema and StoreSchema have been merged to form Schema. However, to reuse schema types and element groups across different stores it is recommended to split your schemas into small modules. \nRecommended modular schema approach\ndata schema\nelement groups and their corresponding types\njson\n{\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"<entityGroupName>\": {\n      \"vertex\": \"<vertexType>\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"<property name>\": \"<property type>\"\n      }\n   }\n },\n \"edges\": {\n   \"<edgeGroupName>\": {\n      \"source\": \"<sourceType>\",\n      \"destination\": \"<destinationType>\",\n      \"directed\": \"<directedType>\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"<property name>\": \"<property type>\"\n      }\n    }\n }\n}\ndata types\nall types and their corresponding functions for validation\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"<type name>\": {\n      \"class\": \"<class name>\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"<validate function class name>\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nstore schema\nstore specific configuration such as the vertex serialiser\njson\n{\n  \"vertexSerialiserClass\": \"<serialiser class name>\"\n}\nstore types\nall types and their corresponding functions for aggregation, additional store validation, store position, serialiser\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"simpleProperty\": {\n      \"serialiserClass\": \"<serialiser class name>\",\n      \"position\": \"<position e.g VALUE>\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"<aggregate function class name>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nIn some cases it would be useful to split the schemas out future, such as:\n- the dataSchema could be split out into element groups to allow the groups to be shared across graphs\n- the store types could be split out future to allow for stores that don't support aggregation.\n.

Instead they just require transient properties (along with filterFunctions and transformFunctions).\nViews will now be validated before an operation is executed to ensure it is valid against the graph schema.\nSo a valid view now looks like this:\njson\n\"view\": {\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"summaryGroup\": {\n      \"transientProperties\": {\n        \"average\": \"java.lang.Float\"\n      },\n      \"filterFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsMoreThan\",\n            \"value\": 5\n          },\n          \"selection\": [\n            {\n              \"key\": \"count\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"transformFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.example.function.transform.Average\"\n          },\n          \"selection\": [\n            {\n              \"key\": \"count\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"key\": \"sum\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"projection\": [\n            {\n              \"key\": \"average\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nthis would only be valid as long as the corresponding schema defines properties \"count\" and \"sum\"\n. Javadoc has been uploaded to http://governmentcommunicationsheadquarters.github.io/Gaffer/\n. I can't seem to reproduce this. Please could you provide the code you were using to throw the exception.\n. Probably best to remove the not flag from FilterFunction and create a Not filter function that wraps a FilterFunction and inverts the result.\n. ### Migration steps\nThe not flag on FilterFunction has been removed. So if you were using this in a data schema, store schema or view then you will need to wrap your function inside a Not filter function.\nFor example:\nin json\njson\n\"filter\": {\n  \"functions\": [\n    {\n      \"function\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.Not\",\n        \"function\": {\n          \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsEqual\",\n          \"value\": \"user02\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"selection\": [\n        {\n          \"key\": \"userId\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\nin java using a view builder\njava\n.filter(new ElementFilter.Builder()\n  .select(Property.USER_ID)\n  .execute(new Not(new IsEqual(\"user02\")))\n  .build())\nAny custom filter functions will also need to be migrated to implement the method\njava\npublic boolean isValid(final Object[] input);\ninstead of \njava\nprotected boolean _isValid(final Object[] input);\nThere also are classes FilterFunctionTest, AggregateFunctionTest and TransformFunctionTest that should be extended when writing tests for any custom functions.\n. Merged into develop\n. The limiting number could be added as a field to the operation class.\n. Merged into develop.\n. ## Migration Steps\nThe query parameter 'n' has been removed from the rest api. Instead, each get operation now has a resultsLimit field - this allows each operation in a chain to be limited instead of just the final operation.\n. Merged into develop\n. Merged into release 0.3.1 branch\n. This issue will also address:\n- Renaming constants files to package specific names to avoid import conflict\n- Adding ability to use custom partitioner to addElementsFromhdfs operation\n. Merged into develop\n. We may need to add an additional section to the data schema for extra input validation. This would allow additional validation (could be computationally expensive) to be carried out when elements are added. However this will require a substantial change to the code will should be investigated as a separate issue gh-72.\n. This will now be done via a store schema validator section in issue gh-17\n. It is quite simple to make this change, it won't cause a breaking change, just simply an extra 'aggregator' field in the ViewElementDefinition class. So I'm happy for this to come after version 1.0.\nWe should wait until someone actually needs this feature before implementing it.. OK, I take my previous comment back. Seeing as thought it is quite simple to implement, it would be worth adding as it allows users to ask questions like this:\nAssume you have some Edges in day buckets (achieved using a day timestamp groupBy property), so you can either query for Edges on a particular day or summarise over multiple days. If you have a property like 'count' on your Edges, then for a particular day the count is the sum of Edges that occurred in that day.\nAt query time if you were able to change the Sum aggregator to a Max aggregator for the count property you could then summarise the days together and calculate the maximum count that occurred in the provided day range.. It might be easier to do #1060 first.. This is what the updated documentation will look like:\nAggregation\nThe code for this example is Aggregation.\nAggregation is a key powerful feature in Gaffer and we will guide you through it in this walkthrough. \nAggregation is applied at ingest and query time.\n\nIngest aggregation permanently aggregates similar elements together. Elements will be aggregated if:\nAn entity has the same group, vertex, visibility and any specified groupBy property values are identical.\nAn edge has the same group, source, destination, directed and any specified groupBy property values are identical.\n\n\nQuery aggregation allows additional summarisation depending on a user's visibility permissions and any overridden groupBy properties provided at query time.\n\nFor this dev.walkthrough we have added a timestamp to our csv data:\ncsv\nM5,10,11,2000-05-01 07:00:00\nM5,10,11,2000-05-01 08:00:00\nM5,10,11,2000-05-02 09:00:00\nM5,11,10,2000-05-03 09:00:00\nM5,23,24,2000-05-04 07:00:00\nM5,23,24,2000-05-04 07:00:00\nM5,28,27,2000-05-04 07:00:00\nThe schema is similar to what we have seen before, but we have added a start date and a end date property. \nThese properties have been added to the groupBy field. \nProperties in the groupBy will be used to determine whether elements should be aggregated together at ingest. \nProperty values in the groupBy are required to be identical for Gaffer to aggregate them at ingest.\nElements schema\n```json\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"RoadUse\": {\n      \"description\": \"A directed edge representing vehicles moving from junction A to junction B.\",\n      \"source\": \"junction\",\n      \"destination\": \"junction\",\n      \"directed\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"startDate\": \"date.earliest\",\n        \"endDate\": \"date.latest\",\n        \"count\": \"count.long\"\n      },\n      \"groupBy\": [\n        \"startDate\",\n        \"endDate\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"RoadHasJunction\": {\n      \"description\": \"A directed edge from each road to all the junctions on that road.\",\n      \"source\": \"road\",\n      \"destination\": \"junction\",\n      \"directed\": \"true\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nTypes schema\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"junction\": {\n      \"description\": \"A road junction represented by a String.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\"\n    },\n    \"road\": {\n      \"description\": \"A road represented by a String.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\"\n    },\n    \"count.long\": {\n      \"description\": \"A long count that must be greater than or equal to 0.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Long\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsMoreThan\",\n          \"orEqualTo\": true,\n          \"value\": {\n            \"java.lang.Long\": 0\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Sum\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"true\": {\n      \"description\": \"A simple boolean that must always be true.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsTrue\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"date.earliest\": {\n      \"description\": \"A Date that when aggregated together will be the earliest date.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.util.Date\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Min\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"date.latest\": {\n      \"description\": \"A Date that when aggregated together will be the latest date.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.util.Date\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Max\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nOnce we have loaded the data into Gaffer, we can fetch all the edges using a GetAllElements operation.\nNote this operation is not recommended for large Graphs as it will do a full scan of your database and could take a while to finish.\n```java\nfinal GetAllElements getAllRoadUseEdges = new GetAllElements.Builder()\n        .view(new View.Builder()\n                .edge(\"RoadUse\")\n                .build())\n        .build();\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> roadUseElements = graph.execute(getAllRoadUseEdges, user);\n```\nAll edges:\n```\nEdge[source=10,destination=11,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Mon May 01 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=2,startDate=Mon May 01 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\nEdge[source=10,destination=11,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Tue May 02 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=1,startDate=Tue May 02 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\nEdge[source=11,destination=10,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Wed May 03 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=1,startDate=Wed May 03 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\nEdge[source=23,destination=24,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Thu May 04 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=2,startDate=Thu May 04 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\nEdge[source=28,destination=27,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Thu May 04 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=1,startDate=Thu May 04 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\n```\nYou will see in the results, the timestamp has been converted into start and end dates - the midnight before the timestamp and a millisecond before the following midnight, i.e. the start and end of the day. This effectively creates a time bucket with day granularity. \nSo all edges with a timestamp on the same day have been aggregated together (ingest aggregation).\nThese aggregated edges have had all their properties aggregated together using the aggregate functions specified in the schema. \nNext we will further demonstrate query time aggregation and get all the 'RoadUse' edges with the same source to the same destination to be aggregated together, regardless of the start and end dates. \nThis is achieved by overriding the groupBy field with empty array so no properties are grouped on. Here is the operation:\n```java\nfinal GetAllElements edgesSummarisedOperation = new GetAllElements.Builder()\n        .view(new View.Builder()\n                .edge(\"RoadUse\", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()\n                        .groupBy() // set the group by properties to 'none'\n                        .build())\n                .build())\n        .build();\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> edgesSummarised = graph.execute(edgesSummarisedOperation, user);\n```\nThe summarised edges are as follows:\n```\nEdge[source=10,destination=11,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Tue May 02 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=3,startDate=Mon May 01 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\nEdge[source=11,destination=10,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Wed May 03 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=1,startDate=Wed May 03 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\nEdge[source=23,destination=24,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Thu May 04 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=2,startDate=Thu May 04 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\nEdge[source=28,destination=27,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Thu May 04 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=1,startDate=Thu May 04 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\n```\nNow you can see the edges from 10 to 11 have been aggregated together and their counts have been summed together.\nIf we apply some pre-aggregation filtering, we can return a time window summary of the edges. The new operation looks like:\n```java\nfinal GetAllElements edgesSummarisedInTimeWindowOperation = new GetAllElements.Builder()\n        .view(new View.Builder()\n                .edge(\"RoadUse\", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()\n                        .preAggregationFilter(new ElementFilter.Builder()\n                                .select(\"startDate\")\n                                .execute(new IsMoreThan(MAY_01_2000, true))\n                                .select(\"endDate\")\n                                .execute(new IsLessThan(MAY_02_2000, false))\n                                .build()\n                        )\n                        .groupBy() // set the group by properties to 'none'\n                        .build())\n                .build())\n        .build();\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> edgesSummarisedInTimeWindow = graph.execute(edgesSummarisedInTimeWindowOperation, user);\n```\nThe time window summaries are:\n```\nEdge[source=10,destination=11,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Mon May 01 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=2,startDate=Mon May 01 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\n```\nNow we have all the RoadUse edges that fall in the time window May 01 2000 to May 03 2000. This filtered out all edges apart from 2 occuring between junction 10 and 11. Therefore, the count is has been aggregated to just 2 (instead of 3 as seen previously).\nAggregation also works nicely alongside visibilities. Data at different visibility levels is stored separately then at query time, the query time aggregation will summarise just the data that a given user can see.\nThere is another more advanced feature to query time aggregation.\nWhen executing a query you can override the logic for how Gaffer aggregates properties together. \nSo by default the count property is aggregated with Sum. \nAt query time we could change that, to force the count property is aggregated with the Min aggregator, therefore finding the minimum daily count.\nThis feature doesn't affect any of the persisted values and any store aggregation that has already occurred will not be modified.\nSo in this example the Edges have been summarised into daily time buckets and the counts have been aggregated with Sum.\nNow at query time we are able to ask: What is the minimum daily count?\nHere is the java code:\n```java\nfinal GetAllElements edgesSummarisedInTimeWindowWithMinCountOperation = new GetAllElements.Builder()\n        .view(new View.Builder()\n                .edge(\"RoadUse\", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()\n                        .preAggregationFilter(new ElementFilter.Builder()\n                                .select(\"startDate\")\n                                .execute(new IsMoreThan(MAY_01_2000, true))\n                                .select(\"endDate\")\n                                .execute(new IsLessThan(MAY_03_2000, false))\n                                .build()\n                        )\n                        .groupBy() // set the group by properties to 'none'\n                        .aggregator(new ElementAggregator.Builder()\n                                .select(\"count\")\n                                .execute(new Min())\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .build())\n        .build();\nlog(\"GET_ALL_EDGES_SUMMARISED_IN_TIME_WINDOW_RESULT_WITH_MIN_COUNT_JSON\", StringUtil.toString(new JSONSerialiser().serialise(edgesSummarisedInTimeWindowWithMinCountOperation, true)));\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> edgesSummarisedInTimeWindowWithMinCount = graph.execute(edgesSummarisedInTimeWindowWithMinCountOperation, user);\n```\nSo, you can see we have just added an extra 'aggregator' block to the Operation view.\nThis can be written in json like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\",\n  \"view\" : {\n    \"edges\" : {\n      \"RoadUse\" : {\n        \"aggregator\" : {\n          \"operators\" : [ {\n            \"binaryOperator\" : {\n              \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Min\"\n            },\n            \"selection\" : [ \"count\" ]\n          } ]\n        },\n        \"groupBy\" : [ ],\n        \"preAggregationFilterFunctions\" : [ {\n          \"predicate\" : {\n            \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsMoreThan\",\n            \"orEqualTo\" : true,\n            \"value\" : {\n              \"java.util.Date\" : 957135600000\n            }\n          },\n          \"selection\" : [ \"startDate\" ]\n        }, {\n          \"predicate\" : {\n            \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsLessThan\",\n            \"orEqualTo\" : false,\n            \"value\" : {\n              \"java.util.Date\" : 957308400000\n            }\n          },\n          \"selection\" : [ \"endDate\" ]\n        } ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"entities\" : { }\n  }\n}\n```\nWe have increased the time window to 3 days just so there are multiple edges to demonstrate the query time aggregation.\nThe result is:\n```\nEdge[source=10,destination=11,directed=true,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Tue May 02 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=1,startDate=Mon May 01 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\n```\n . Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.\n. Hi @pranita-s,\nThank you for raising the issue, it has highlighted a problem with the way we were loading resources. The framework is still undergoing active development and we are now looking at loading the resources as streams instead of paths.\nWe have raised a ticket gh-78 to deal with the problem and are carrying out the work on branch G78-load-resources. We will get it merged into develop shortly and hopefully it will be included in release 0.3.2. Please feel free to check out this branch and confirm it resolves your issue.\n. Closing this issue as it has been fixed as part of issue gh-78 and has been included in release 0.3.2.\n. Merged into develop\n. Need to add integration tests to check age off works in accumulo\n.

Add a description field to SchemaElementDefinition and TypeDefinition. \nAdd the option to serialise a Schema to json and skip the description field, such as toCompactJson().

Merged into develop.\n. merged into develop\n. merged into develop\n. Merged into develop-0.7.0. The functions library in Gaffer has been split into a separate project called koryphe. This has caused a large number of functions (filters, aggregators and transforms) to be moved and hence the package names have changed.\nWe have also aligned with Java 8 function interfaces:\nFilterFunction -> Predicate\nAggregateFunction -> BinaryOperator\nTransformFunction -> Function\nThe interfaces for these methods has changed too.\nFilterFunction.isValid -> Predicate.test\nAggregateFunction.aggregate -> BinaryOperator.apply\nSimpleAggregateFunction._aggregate -> KorypheBinaryOperator._apply\nTransformFunction.transform -> Function.apply\nThe statelessClone and state methods have been removed.\nthis has also caused package names to be changed so match the java 8 packages.\n```\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.aggregate.FreqMapAggregator -> uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.binaryoperator.FreqMapAggregator\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.aggregate.IntegerFreqMapAggregator -> uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.binaryoperator.IntegerFreqMapAggregator\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.aggregate -> uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.MapFilter -> uk.gov.koryphe.predicate.PredicateMap,\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.filter -> uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.transform -> uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.function\n```\nImplementations of FilterFunctions now need to extend KoryphePredicate. For FilterFunctions that require 2 or more inputs (X) you should implement KoryphePredicateX. The input annotation is no longer used.\nImplementations of AggregateFunctions now need to implement KorypheBinaryOperator. The implementations should now be stateless. To merge 2 objects together, A and B, you can just add the contents of B to object A. The input/output annotations are no longer used.\nImplementations of TransformFunctions now to implement KorypheFunction. For TransformFunctions that require 2 or more inputs (X) you should implement KorypheFunctionX. The input/output annotations are no longer used.\nThe ElementGenerator interface has been split into ElementGenerator and ObjectGenerator.\nYou will need to update your implementations to use the new interfaces.\nThe REST end point has been split into /graph/elementGenerators and /graph/objectGenerators\nElementGenerator.getElements -> ElementGenerator.apply\nOneToOneElementGenerator.getElement -> OneToOneElementGenerator._apply\nElementGenerator.getObjects -> ObjectGenerator.apply\nOneToOneElementGenerator.getObject -> OneToOneObjectGenerator._apply\nThe syntax for serialising validateFunctions in json schemas has been improved slightly.

I believe this is no longer an issue.. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop\n. gh-127 will extend this cache operation and add the functionality to return a new gaffer graph.\n. This should done after gh-129.\n. After some thought, there are some operations (let's call them advanced operations) that we should just disable via the REST API. So we will create a new store property 'gaffer.store.operation.advanced.mode' to toggle advanced mode. When we are not in advanced mode (i.e. when running over a rest api) we should disable these advanced operations such as AddElementsFromHdfs.\nBy default we will set the advanced mode to true. The rest api DefaultGraphFactory will disable advanced mode.. Getting this working via the rest api would be quite difficult due to conflicting dependencies. For now the rest api will now just automatically disable this operation.. Merged into develop.. The accumulo store inserts all edges both ways round so we need to make sure that when all the elements are returned via the new operation we don't return these extra flipped edges. In order to differentiate the flipped undirected edges we should compare the source and destination bytes and return edges where source is 'less than or equal' to destination.\n. Hi @pranita-s \nI've been trying to replicate your problem, but I am struggling. When I do:\nbash\nmvn install -P exampleJar\nit produces the example-simple-query-jar-with-dependencies.jar and, for me, it does include com/fasterxml/jackson/core/util/ByteArrayBuilder. As this class is in the jar, when this jar is deployed on Accumulo, Accumulo should be able to find the class.\nPlease could you check your example-simple-query-jar-with-dependencies.jar so we can try and narrow down the problem. If you run the following it should list the ByteArrayBuilder.class file contained in the jar:\nbash\njar -tvf example/target/example-simple-query-jar-with-dependencies.jar | grep com/fasterxml/jackson/core/util/ByteArrayBuilder\nOn a side note, the examples are set up to run on a mock Accumulo store, purely as a quick walk through of the framework. If you want to run the example on a real Accumulo cluster then you may need to make a few changes. For example, you would need to change the store.properties file (in example/src/main/resources) - change the value of gaffer.store.class to gaffer.accumulostore.AccumuloStore and update the other relevant properties.\n. OK, from your previous comments it looked like you were trying to run the jars on a real Accumulo cluster. \nTo run the example on the mock Accumulo store it is actually quite straight forward - it doesn't require an Accumulo cluster or even any additional Accumulo jars, everything it needs is packaged inside the jar-with-dependencies. \nTo run it all you need is java and to execute the jar:\nsh\njava -jar example-simple-query-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n. Assuming your initial question has been answered, please reopen the issue if you need to. We have raised a bug gh-164, to fix the build on Windows.\n. Need to update documentation to state that the cache is maintained per single request only, it cannot be used across multiple separate operation requests. So, it must be used inside a single operation chain.\n. Updated javadoc as stated in previous comment.\n. Linked to gh-247\n. I think implementing this may mean a rather complicated Operation and tricky to use. Instead users should use a FederatedStore.. Should be done after gh-129.\n. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop\n. Now if you want to run the integration tests over your store all you have to do is create a test file named [store-name]ITs.java, which extends AbstractStoreITs and create a default constructor that calls super(StoreProperties, ...). The constructor should create your store properties and if you have any special store schema configuration then also pass that to the super constructor - see AccumuloStoreITs.java for an example. \n. Merged into develop.\n. This would be helpful for the gaffer-tools issue gh-9\n. Work in progress on branch gh-140-proxy-store. Merged into develop.. A Gaffer Graph exposes a method to execute a single operation or a chain of operations. For example, if you wanted to start at a vertex 'vertex1' and traverse along 3 edges and get the vertices at the end you can build up an operation chain using 3 GetAdjacentEntitySeeds operations. This can be written directly in Java and executed directly on the Graph or in JSON and execute via the REST API.\n``` java\nfinal Graph graph = new Graph.Builder()\n    .storeProperties(storeProperties)\n    .addSchema(schema)\n    .build();\nfinal OperationChain> operationChain = new OperationChain.Builder()\n    .first(new GetAdjacentEntitySeeds.Builder()\n        .addSeed(new EntitySeed(\"vertex1\"))\n        .build())\n    .then(new GetAdjacentEntitySeeds())\n    .then(new GetAdjacentEntitySeeds())\n    .build();\nfinal Iterable results = graph.execute(operationChain);\n```\njson\n{\n    \"operations\" : [ \n    {\n        \"class\" : \"gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAdjacentEntitySeeds\",\n        \"seeds\" : [ \n            {\n              \"gaffer.operation.data.EntitySeed\" : {\n                \"vertex\" : \"vertex1\"\n              }\n            } \n        ]\n    }, \n    {\n        \"class\" : \"gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAdjacentEntitySeeds\"\n    }, \n    {\n        \"class\" : \"gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAdjacentEntitySeeds\"\n    } \n  ]\n}\nI'm assuming you will be running your performance test on the Accumulo implementation, however please note that as Gaffer is a framework you could actually write a Neo4J or Titan implementation of Gaffer.\nWe are currently working on a lightweight TinkerPop implementation of Gaffer (gh-110) - it will simply wrap Gaffer in the TinkerPop API. There will be a few limitations due to Gaffer not currently supporting edits, deletes or fetch all elements without a seed. But from our initial investigations it looks like it will work quite well. We hope to have the code pushed up in the near future.\n. Assuming your question has been answered, please reopen the issue if you need to.\n. I was thinking about using codecov which also integrates nicely with github.\n. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop. \n. Merged into develop\n. merged into develop\n. Merged into develop as part of gh-131.\n. Merged into release-0.3.4\n. We could really do with a test to check all the accumulo operations have registered handlers. \nWe do a similar thing in test StoreTest.shouldCreateStoreWithValidSchemasAndRegisterOperations, however, this only tests the core operations have been registered. We need a similar method in AccumuloStoreTest, to check the extra operations.\n. We have had a few problems with builders now - perhaps we should add the following method to the OperationTest interface:\njava\n@Test\nvoid shouldBuildOperation();\nThen we should write a test for all operation builders to check all the builder methods are available, public, return the correct builder and set the correct field on the operation.\n. Hi @pranita-s \nWe have just attempted to build the project on a Windows environment and as you correctly pointed out it fails. From a quick glance at the errors, it looks like there are several issues due to different new line encodings on Windows and Unix. \nI have raised an issue, gh-164, to make the maven build compatible with Windows in the future. So unfortunately for the time being it will need to be built on a Unix environment.\nAdditionally, until we have been able to further test running the application on Windows, we recommend that it is also run on a Unix environment.\n. Closing this bug as it will be fixed by issue gh-164.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop\n. I agree, properties are an integral part of elements so let\u2019s make the equals method compare everything in an element.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Please have a quick look at our branching strategy: https://github.com/GovernmentCommunicationsHeadquarters/Gaffer/wiki/Ways-of-Working#git-branching-model\nIssues should be worked off the develop branch and merged back into the develop branch.\n. Closed pull request as the work will be merged in via pull request gh-176.\n. Merged into develop as part of gh-131.\n. This is covered by gh-182.\n. See comments from old pull request gh-168.\n. See gh-195\n. The changes look good. We could also really do with similar methods in the REST API within GraphConfigurationService to allows users to call your new graph methods via the REST API. This can either be done as part of this issue or we can create a separate issue for the work.\n. There are a few swagger icons that I don't think we are using and could be removed.\n. This should also fix gh-172.\n. Merged into develop.\n. # Migration steps\nThe example module has been renamed to example-graph. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop as part of gh-131.\n. ## Migration Steps\nThe Graph and Store classes now have an additional 'User' parameter required for the execute methods.\nThe User object contains the id of the user executing the operation and any data authorisations the user has. The default constructor for User will create a user with ID = \"UNKOWN\".\nREST API implementations that have user based requests should override the createUser method and return a User object, populated with the user's id and auths.\nPreviously the Accumulo store used an operation option for the user auths. Instead of adding that option, users should now create a User object with those auths. e.g:\nPreviously:\n``` java\nfinal GetRelatedEdges getRelatedEdges = new GetRelatedEdges.Builder()\n    .addSeed(new EntitySeed(\"1\"))\n    .option(AccumuloStoreConstants.OPERATION_AUTHORISATIONS, \"public,private\")\n    .build();\ngraph.execute(getRelatedEdges)\n```\nNow:\n``` java\nfinal User user01 = new User.Builder()\n    .userId(\"user01\")\n    .dataAuth(\"public\")\n    .dataAuth(\"private\")\n    .build();\nfinal GetRelatedEdges getRelatedEdges = new GetRelatedEdges.Builder()\n    .addSeed(new EntitySeed(\"1\"))\n    .build();\ngraph.execute(getRelatedEdges, user01)\n```\n. Merged into develop.\n. ## Migration Steps\nThe GetElementsSeed operation has been rename to GetElementsBySeed. Any uses of this operation will need to be updated. The functionality of the operation has not changed.\n. Automatic indenting in an IDE would cause problems with this as it would end up looking like:\njava\nSchema.Builder()\n      .type(TestTypes.ID_STRING)\n      .clazz(String.class)\n      .build()\n      .build();\nand I think that is actually more confusing.\n. Closing as I don't think there is currently a way we can simplify them with the current model.. @a09631 as this is nearly a year old it would be good to progress this issue. We don't really want to start refactoring too much of the accumulo store as we will end up breaking some of the complex key package logic. Perhaps we could break this issue into smaller issues that target specific bits of the code.. Merged into develop.\n. Hi @dongxinghua,\nWe have created a lightweight Gaffer implementation of TinkerPop in issue gh-110. This is due to be released within the next couple of weeks. It is included in 0.3.5-RC1 (release candidate 1), as soon as this has been tested it would be released as part of version 0.3.5.\nThere is a README for the TinkerPop implementation, that explains how to use it. Please note it is still experimental and should be used with caution.\nAs it is very early days with this TinkerPop implementation we would appreciate any feedback you have on it.\n. Nearly done - just need to update the docker documentation and create some basic scripts to make building and running the containers easier.\n. Some of the docker files still need improving but that will be done separately. Also we need to create a docker image for the rest api - this will be done in issue gh-261\n. Merged into master in gaffer-docker repository.\n. See comments from old pull request gh-176.\n. In the last release of Gaffer there were a few modifications that mean unfortunately some changes need to be made to the docker scripts to get them working again with Gaffer 0.3.5.\n- Java version now needs updating in the base docker script to 1.8.\n- The gaffer examples have been refactored, so gaffer/setup_files/configure_store_prop.sh will need to be updated to use the correct path for the store properties.\n- The test at the end of the guide will need to be updated to use the slightly modified film example.\nAlso, we could do with 'yum install -y tar' being added to the top of Dockerfile.centos6.gaffer and Dockerfile.hadoop.centos6.\n. Brilliant, thanks. \nThe core framework of Gaffer still requires Java 1.7, however the TinkerPop implementation that was added as a module in 0.3.5 requires 1.8. So in order to build the entire project Java 1.8 is required. If the hadoop testing is a problem, for the time being you could leave Java at 1.7 and exclude the tinkerpop module from the maven build. If using maven with version > 3.2.1 then you can use:\nbash\nmvn clean install -pl \\!tinkerpop\n. ## Migration Steps\nGetRelatedEntities, GetRelatedEdges and their builders are now generic so if you use these classes in java you will need to parameterise them with ElementSeed, EdgeSeed or EntitySeed.\nThe above example would now be:\njava\nnew OperationChain.Builder()\n    .first(new GetAdjacentEntitySeeds.Builder()\n            .addSeed(new EntitySeed(\"1\"))\n            .build())\n    .then(new GetRelatedEdges<EntitySeed>())\n    .build();\n. Isn't really anything we can do about this except for updating to later versions of our dependencies. It looks like the codehaus dependency is being pull in via hadoop-common:2.6.5.. ## Migration Steps\nTo run the examples on the command line you now need to specify which example to run by providing the class name as an argument and using 'java -cp' instead of 'java -jar'\nbash\njava -cp example-jar-with-dependencies.jar gaffer.example.gettingstarted.analytic.LoadAndQuery1\n. Yes, this is something we want to do in the future, but at the moment we don't have a good estimate of when it will be set up.\n. Needs to be done after gh-434\n. The Spark integration is currently tied to the AccumuloStore. In the future we will want to make this generic so it can be used with any type of Gaffer Store.\n. There is a useful guide on the github help pages on syncing forked repositories - https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork try following this guide and using the 'develop' branch in place of where it uses 'master'. When you have updated your local forked develop branch, you will then be able to merge develop into your gh-212-DevelopmentOfSparkIntegration branch.\n. Needs to be merged in after gh-214.\n. Should be merged in after gh-215.\n. The operation examples have been copied up to the wiki.\n. Merged into develop\n. We should create a propertyGroups section in the schema.\ne.g:\njson\n{\n\"edges\" : {\n    \"edgeGroup1\": {\n        \"source\": \"A\",\n        \"destination\": \"B\",\n        \"directed\": \"true\",\n        \"includeProperties\": \"propertyGroup2\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"count\": \"sum.long\"\n        }\n    }\n},\n\"entities\" : {\n    \"entityGroup1\": {\n        \"vertex\": \"A\",\n        \"includeProperties\": \"propertyGroup1\"\n    }\n},\n\"propertyGroups\": {\n    \"propertyGroup1\" : {\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"visibility\": \"visibility\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"propertyGroup2\" : {\n        \"includeProperties\": \"propertyGroup1\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"startTime\": \"min.long\",\n            \"endTime\": \"max.long\"\n        }\n    },\n}\n}\n. Should be done after gh-601.. # Migration steps\nSchemas now must be constructed via the schema builder - Schema.Builder class. Once they have been constructed they cannot be modified. To change a schema you will need to create new schema instance, add the old schema to the builder and make your changes.\n```java\nnew Schema.Builder()\n   .merge(oldSchema)\n   // make your changes\n  .build();\n. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.\n. This will be done as part of issue gh-785. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into release-0.3.6.\n. This solution does not work when running the examples from a jar. We need a different mechanism for loading all resource files in a given folder.\n. Merged into release-0.3.7 branch.\n. ## Migration Steps\nFreqMapIsMoreThan has been replaced with MapFilter and the standard IsMoreThan filter.\nInstead of doing:\njava\nnew FreqMapIsMoreThan(\"key1\", 2, true)\nor \njson\n{\n  \"class\" : \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.FreqMapIsMoreThan\",\n  \"key\" : \"key1\",\n  \"frequency\" : 2,\n  \"orEqualTo\" : true\n}\nyou now have to do:\njava\nnew MapFilter(\"key1\", new IsMoreThan(2, true))\nor\njson\n{\n  \"class\" : \"gaffer.function.MapFilter\",\n  \"function\" : {\n    \"class\" : \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsMoreThan\",\n    \"orEqualTo\" : true,\n    \"value\" : 2\n  },\n  \"key\" : \"key1\"\n}\nAlso, previously the FreqMapIsMoreThan would default to requiring the threshold to be more than 0, now you must always specify the threshold for the filter.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop\n. The ArrayList store was initially intended to demonstrate different types of Gaffer stores. However, it isn't particularly efficient and lacks a lot of the features you get from using a mock accumulo store. I don't think it is worth spending time refactoring this store and adding the extra features in. Instead we could remove the store and implement a different store see gh-278 or gh-279.\n. This applies to the pom for the example module.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Needs to be merged into develop rather than master\n. ## Migration Steps\nThe cache operations have been extended into a set of generic export operations. If you were previously using any of the cache operation then you will need to switch to using the relevant export operations instead.\nFor example, previously the cache operations were used as follows:\njava\nfinal OperationChain<Iterable<?>> cacheOpChain = new OperationChain.Builder()\n  .first(new GetRelatedEdges.Builder<EntitySeed>()\n          .addSeed(new EntitySeed(\"vertex1\"))\n          .build())\n  .then(new UpdateCache())\n  .then(new GenerateObjects.Builder<Edge, EntitySeed>()\n          .generator(new EntitySeedExtractor())\n          .build())\n  .then(new GetRelatedEdges<EntitySeed>())\n  .then(new UpdateCache())\n  .then(new FetchCachedResult())\n  .build();\nThis should now be written as:\njava\nfinal OperationChain<CloseableIterable<?>> exportOpChain = new OperationChain.Builder()\n  .first(new InitialiseSetExport())\n  .then(new GetRelatedEdges.Builder<EntitySeed>()\n          .addSeed(new EntitySeed(\"vertex1\"))\n          .build())\n  .then(new UpdateExport())\n  .then(new GenerateObjects.Builder<Edge, EntitySeed>()\n          .generator(new EntitySeedExtractor())\n          .build())\n  .then(new GetRelatedEdges<EntitySeed>())\n  .then(new UpdateExport())\n  .then(new FetchExport())\n  .build();\n.

Instead there is a now a 'groupBy' field, which should contain the list of property names that should be used as aggregation keys.\nThere is are also 2 new fields, visibilityProperty and timestampProperty, that defines which properties are for visibility and timestamp.\nMigration for accumulo positions\nThe following changes may need to be made to your schema files:\n- Remove any reference to positions\n- Any properties that were previously stored in the column qualifier need to be added to the groupBy properties list - in the order that they are currently stored.\n- If you used the visibility position for a property, then this property name should be assigned to the visibilityProperty field.\n- If you used the timestamp position for a property, then this property name should be assigned to the timestampProperty field.\nExample schema migration\nIf your schema was previously:\n``` json\n{\n    \"entities\": {\n        \"BasicEdge\": {\n            \"vertex\": \"vertex\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"prop1a\": \"keyed-string\",\n                \"prop1b\": \"keyed-string\",\n                \"prop2\": \"simple-string\",\n                \"visibility\": \"visibility.string\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"timestamp.long\",\n            }\n        }\n    },\n\"types\": {\n    \"vertex\": {\n        \"class\": \"java.lang.String\"\n    },\n    \"keyed-string\": {\n        \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n        \"position\": \"COLUMN_QUALIFIER\"\n    },\n    \"string\": {\n        \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n        \"position\": \"VALUE\"\n    },\n    \"visibility.string\": {\n        \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n        \"position\": \"VISIBILITY\"\n    },\n    \"timestamp.long\": {\n        \"class\": \"java.lang.Long\",\n        \"position\": \"TIMESTAMP\"\n    }\n},\n\n \"vertexSerialiserClass\": \"gaffer.serialisation.simple.StringSerialiser\"\n\n}\n```\nThis would need to be migrated to:\n``` json\n{\n    \"entities\": {\n        \"BasicEdge\": {\n            \"vertex\": \"string\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"prop1a\": \"string\",\n                \"prop1b\": \"string\",\n                \"prop2\": \"string\",\n                \"visibility\": \"string\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"long\"\n            },\n            \"groupBy\": [\n                \"prop1a\", \"prop1b\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n\"types\": {\n    \"vertex\": {\n        \"class\": \"java.lang.String\"\n    },\n    \"string\": {\n        \"class\": \"java.lang.String\"\n    },\n    \"long\": {\n        \"class\": \"java.lang.Long\",\n    }\n},\n\n\"vertexSerialiserClass\": \"gaffer.serialisation.simple.StringSerialiser\",\n\"visibilityProperty\": \"visibility\",\n\"timestampProperty\": \"timestamp\"\n\n}\n```\n.

Hi @unclassified01,\nThanks for raising the issue. There are a few different jars produced from the build for different usages. \n- If you are simply running the example then there is a maven profile \u2018exampleJar\u2019, which produces an example jar with all dependencies.\n- If you are deploying the jars onto Accumulo for use by the iterators then you need to use the following jars produced by the default maven build: \n  - accumulo-store-iterators-[version].jar\n  - simple-serialisation-[version]-library-serialisers.jar\n  - simple-function-[version]-library-functions.jar\nWe will get the wiki updated with this extra information. Hope that helps, if not then let us know which jar has the missing dependencies and we will look into it.\n. Closing as we have updated the wiki with the additional information. Please let us know if you have any other questions.\n. Hi @flitte,\nInteresting question. As you mentioned this can be done via an operation chain, similar to:\nJava\njava\nfinal OperationChain<Iterable<SimpleEdgeDataObject>> opChain = new OperationChain.Builder()\n        .first(new GetRelatedElements.Builder()\n                .addSeed(new EntitySeed(\"vertex1\"))\n                .build())\n        .then(new GenerateObjects.Builder<Element, CustomGenerator>()\n                .generator(new CustomGenerator())\n                .build())\n        .build();\nJSON\njson\n{\n  \"operations\": [\n    {\n      \"class\": \"gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetRelatedElements\",\n      \"seeds\": [\n        {\n          \"gaffer.operation.data.EntitySeed\": {\n            \"vertex\": \"vertex1\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"class\": \"gaffer.operation.impl.generate.GenerateObjects\",\n      \"elementGenerator\": {\n        \"class\": \"package.name.CustomGenerator\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nWe have thought about creating a generator registry to avoid having to supply the CustomGenerator to the GenerateObjects operation and then Gaffer would automatically use the correct generator for you. However, selecting the correct generator to use isn\u2019t always possible if there are multiple generators dealing with different domain objects - users would need to specify the type of domain object they wished to be returned.\nAs it stands, you could write an ElementGenerator implementation that could deal with all elements and correctly hand the elements off to the correct ElementGenerator automatically. This could be based on the element group (see gaffer.example.films.generator.DataGenerator, or a particular property value (such as 'domainClass').\n. So we could check the table is configured in the same way Gaffer configures a table. When gaffer creates an Accumulo table it always removes the Accumulo Versioning iterator and adds a bloom filter property. It then adds a validator iterator and an aggregator iterator (if the schema has aggregators).\n. It is surprisingly common for users to think they need to manually create a table in Accumulo before creating an AccumuloStore. If they do this then the table will not have the correct Bloom filters and iterators set, and this will cause poor performance and errors.\nWe should investigate setting a configuration property on a table when Gaffer creates it. Whenever a new store is created against that table, then the property could be checked, and if it is not present then the creation of the store should fail (if there are scenarios where experienced users may need to manually create a table and add iterators, then there could be an option on the store properties to ignore this warning, and carry on, but the default should be to fail).. ## Migration Steps\nThe following serialisers have been moved into the core serialisation module. This meant the package names needed to be changed. If you are using any of the following serialisers, you will need to switch to use the new ones - simply update the package names in your schema.\n- gaffer.serialisation.implementation.BooleanSerialiser\n- gaffer.serialisation.implementation.StringSerialiser\n- gaffer.serialisation.implementation.TreeSetStringSerialiser\n- gaffer.serialisation.implementation.raw.CompactRawIntegerSerialiser\n- gaffer.serialisation.implementation.raw.CompactRawLongSerialiser\n. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop.\n. After some discussion we think that we will leave the restriction on unique groups for the time being. \ngh-219 will allow users to create a propertyGroup and reuse that propertyGroup across multiple element groups. Using the \"red\" example above, it would be up the user to create a propertyGroup called \"red\" then create an entity group called \"entity_red\" and an edge group called \"edge_red\" that both includes the properties from \"red\".\n. Merged into develop.\n. This may need reworking after issue gh-260.\n. Merged into develop\n. ## Migration Steps\nThe summarise flag has been replaced with a groupBy property in the view on each edge/entity.\nThe groupBy in the view allows you to define a subset of the the groupBy properties in the schema. If you don\u2019t specify a groupBy in the view then it will use what is in the schema.\nSo to migrate from previous summarise true/false values:\nsummarise = false           ->   don\u2019t specify a groupBy  (groupBy null)\nsummarise = true            ->   set groupBy to an empty array for each entity/edge\nnew partial summarise   ->   specify some properties in the groupBy\n. Thanks again for your help. As you saw we have a very basic implementation over in the Gaffer Tools Repository. \nThe current implementation was written just to investigate if and how it might be done and is still very much a prototype. Unfortunately we just haven't had chance to tidy it up and implement the extra bits. As you mentioned, we do really need to make use of TraversalStrategies to optimise it for Gaffer.\nI'll close this issue and reopen a similar one in the gaffer tools repo with your ideas.\n. Closing as the issue is now being tracked in the gaffer-experimental repository: https://github.com/gchq/gaffer-experimental/issues/7. Closing as the issue is now being tracked in the gaffer-experimental repository: https://github.com/gchq/gaffer-experimental/issues/8. Closing as the issue is now being tracked in the gaffer-experimental repository: https://github.com/gchq/gaffer-experimental/issues/9. There is a basic working version on branch gh-281-schema-builder. It needs further work to tidy up the code and improve the functionality. However, it is quite easy to get it running, see: Schema Builder.\n. Note - the gh-281 branch is now quite out of date as the format of a Gaffer schema has changed slightly.\n. This has been merged into develop in the Gaffer Tools repository. Merged into develop\n. The basic implementation has been done on branch gh-283-file-exporter. This requires further work to remove old exports and needs further testing.\n. As we have no requirement for this I am going to close it. The implementation would be different depending on the platform you are running on and you may need various security handling and age off to be carried out. If this is something you require then it is probably best to just write your own custom operation.. This exporter was intended to just export elements to a different accumulo table on the same instance of accumulo. Therefore, it would be able to use the same accumulo login details and gaffer schema. \nExporting elements to a different Gaffer store is a bit more complicated and we will tackle that in a separate issue - we have just created issue gh-287 to do it.\n. This will be done as part of gh-287.. Merged into develop as part of #287.. Merged into develop\n. Work in progress on branch gh-287-export-to-graph. I have implemented a very basic ExportToOtherGraph operation that takes a StoreProperties object. It is different to other Export operations as it doesn't use the \"key\" field and it doesn't implement a Get from export. Perhaps we need to update the parent Export interface. . Rather than a user having to provide the store properties in their query we should allow them to provide just a graphId (and optionally a store properties ID) and then we can use the store properties associated with the graphId or store properties ID.\nIssue #954 should be creating a GraphLibrary where these IDs will be stored.. The example for this operation to go on the wiki is:\nExportToOtherGraph example\nSee javadoc - uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.export.graph.ExportToOtherGraph.\nThese export examples export all edges in the example graph to another Gaffer instance. \nTo add this operation to your Gaffer graph you will need to include the ExportToOtherGraphOperationDeclarations.json in your store properties, i.e. set this property: gaffer.store.operation.declarations=ExportToOtherGraphOperationDeclarations.json\nRequired fields\nThe following fields are required: \n- graphId\nSimple export\nThis example will export all Edges with group 'edge' to another Gaffer graph with new ID 'newGraphId'. The new graph will have the same schema and same store properties as the current graph. In this case it will just create another table in accumulo called 'newGraphId'.\nAs Java:\njava\nfinal OperationChain<CloseableIterable<? extends Element>> opChain =\n        new OperationChain.Builder()\n                .first(new GetAllElements.Builder()\n                        .view(new View.Builder()\n                                .edge(\"edge\")\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .then(new ExportToOtherGraph.Builder<CloseableIterable<? extends Element>>()\n                        .graphId(\"newGraphId\")\n                        .build())\n                .build();\nAs JSON:\njson\n{\n  \"operations\" : [ {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\",\n    \"view\" : {\n      \"edges\" : {\n        \"edge\" : { }\n      },\n      \"entities\" : { }\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.export.graph.ExportToOtherGraph\",\n    \"graphId\" : \"newGraphId\"\n  } ]\n}\n\nSimple export with custom graph\nThis example will export all Edges with group 'edge' to another Gaffer graph with new ID 'newGraphId'. The new graph will have the custom provided schema (note it must contain the same Edge group 'edge' otherwise the exported edges will be invalid') and custom store properties. The store properties could be any store properties e.g. Accumulo, HBase, Map, Proxy store properties.\nAs Java:\njava\nfinal Schema schema = Schema.fromJson(StreamUtil.openStreams(getClass(), \"operation/schema\"));\nfinal StoreProperties storeProperties = StoreProperties.loadStoreProperties(StreamUtil.openStream(getClass(), \"othermockaccumulostore.properties\"));\nfinal OperationChain<CloseableIterable<? extends Element>> opChain =\n        new OperationChain.Builder()\n                .first(new GetAllElements.Builder()\n                        .view(new View.Builder()\n                                .edge(\"edge\")\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .then(new ExportToOtherGraph.Builder<CloseableIterable<? extends Element>>()\n                        .graphId(\"newGraphId\")\n                        .schema(schema)\n                        .storeProperties(storeProperties)\n                        .build())\n                .build();\nAs JSON:\njson\n{\n  \"operations\" : [ {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\",\n    \"view\" : {\n      \"edges\" : {\n        \"edge\" : { }\n      },\n      \"entities\" : { }\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.export.graph.ExportToOtherGraph\",\n    \"graphId\" : \"newGraphId\",\n    \"schema\" : {\n      \"edges\" : {\n        \"edge\" : {\n          \"properties\" : {\n            \"count\" : \"int\"\n          },\n          \"groupBy\" : [ ],\n          \"source\" : \"int\",\n          \"destination\" : \"int\",\n          \"directed\" : \"true\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"entities\" : {\n        \"entity\" : {\n          \"properties\" : {\n            \"count\" : \"int\"\n          },\n          \"groupBy\" : [ ],\n          \"vertex\" : \"int\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"vertexSerialiser\" : {\n        \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.serialisation.implementation.raw.RawIntegerSerialiser\"\n      },\n      \"types\" : {\n        \"int\" : {\n          \"serialiser\" : {\n            \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.serialisation.implementation.raw.CompactRawIntegerSerialiser\"\n          },\n          \"aggregateFunction\" : {\n            \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Sum\"\n          },\n          \"class\" : \"java.lang.Integer\"\n        },\n        \"true\" : {\n          \"validateFunctions\" : [ {\n            \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsTrue\"\n          } ],\n          \"class\" : \"java.lang.Boolean\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"storeProperties\" : {\n      \"accumulo.instance\" : \"someInstanceName\",\n      \"gaffer.cache.service.class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.cache.impl.JcsCacheService\",\n      \"accumulo.password\" : \"password\",\n      \"accumulo.zookeepers\" : \"aZookeeper\",\n      \"gaffer.store.class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.accumulostore.MockAccumuloStore\",\n      \"gaffer.store.job.tracker.enabled\" : \"true\",\n      \"gaffer.store.operation.declarations\" : \"NamedOperationDeclarations.json,ResultCacheExportOperations.json,ExportToOtherGraphOperationDeclarations.json\",\n      \"gaffer.store.properties.class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.accumulostore.AccumuloProperties\",\n      \"accumulo.user\" : \"user01\"\n    }\n  } ]\n}\n\nSimple to other gaffer rest api\nThis example will export all Edges with group 'edge' to another Gaffer REST API.To export to another Gaffer REST API, we go via a Gaffer Proxy Store.

The full class name has changed fromgaffer.function.simple.types.FreqMap to gaffer.types.simple. FreqMap\n. We have also come across a few issues with the NON_DEFAULT flag. Initially we thought it would be useful as it would reduce the amount of data sent via the REST API, but it has led to complications.\nI agree we should just remove the NON_DEFAULT option.\nOn a side note, looking at your schema, your 'myEdge' group states the edge should be directed but you are adding undirected edges into your graph. Either you have skipped validation or you may want to ensure you have the following in your dataTypes.json file:\njson\n\"true\": {\n  \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\",\n  \"validateFunctions\": [\n    {\n      \"function\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsTrue\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n.

As part of the buildAndRun script it builds 4 docker containers, 1 is the gaffer-docker/gaffer container. From your logs it looks like the gaffer container failed to build. If you still have the previous logs I expect there will be an error message in the process of building the gaffer container.\nAs this code isn't on the master branch yet - it has become a bit out of date and there is a high chance the Gaffer code has changed and is no longer compatible with the docker scripts.\n. New docker files have been merged into master in gaffer-docker repository. They are still using gaffer version 0.3.9 - but hopefully it fixes your issue. If you have any other problems please let us know.\nWe have also pushed the docker container (gchq/gaffer:0.3.9) up to docker hub.\n. Although it makes it simpler for a user having just 1 operation to do all the above steps, if we did this for lots of different cases then we could end up with a huge number of operations which would be confusing. Perhaps we just need to improve the documentation and create an example operation chain in the examples section of the wiki.. OK, perhaps we could just update the AddElementsFromHdfs operation to delegate to SampleDataForSplitPoints and SplitTable operations first if the table has no split points already defined.. # Migration Steps\nThe following operations have been renamed:\n- uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.accumulostore.operation.hdfs.operation.SampleDataForSplitPoints -> uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.hdfs.operation.SampleDataForSplitPoints\n- uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.accumulostore.operation.hdfs.operation.SplitTable -> uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.SplitStore\nThese magic AddElementsFromHdfs operation options have been replaced with fields on the operation:\n- accumulostore.operation.hdfs.use_accumulo_partitioner -> partitioner (if you wish to disable using a partitioner, you can set the partitioner class to uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.hdfs.operation.partitioner.NoPartitioner)\n- accumulostore.operation.hdfs.use_provided_splits_file -> useProvidedSplits\n- accumulostore.operation.hdfs.splits.file_path -> splitsFilePath\n- accumulostore.operation.bulk_import.min_reducers -> minReduceTasks\n- accumulostore.operation.bulk_import.max_reducers -> maxReduceTasks\nIf your Accumulo table has less than 2 splits (and more than 1 tablet sever) then when you do an AddElementsFromHdfs it will first sample the data and generate splits, set the splits on your table and then do the add from hdfs. It does this by delegating to the SampleDataForSplitPoints and SplitStore operations.\nWhen this has been released there will be an example of an AddElementsFromHdfs here.. Merged into develop.. AddElementsFromHdfs example\nSee javadoc - uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.hdfs.operation.AddElementsFromHdfs.\nThis operation must be run as a Hadoop Job. So you will need to package up a shaded jar containing a main method that creates an instance of Graph and executes the operation. It can then be run with: \nbash\nhadoop jar custom-shaded-jar.jar\nWhen running an AddElementsFromHdfs on Accumulo, if you do not specify useProvidedSplits and the Accumulo table does not have a full set of split points then this operation will first sample the input data, generate split points and set them on the Accumulo table. It does this by delegating to SampleDataForSplitPoints and class uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.SplitStore.\nRequired fields\nThe following fields are required: \n- failurePath\n- mapperGeneratorClassName\n- inputPaths\n- outputPath\n- jobInitialiser\nAdd elements from hdfs\nAs Java:\njava\nfinal AddElementsFromHdfs operation = new AddElementsFromHdfs.Builder()\n        .addInputPath(\"/path/to/input/fileOrFolder\")\n        .outputPath(\"/path/to/output/folder\")\n        .failurePath(\"/path/to/failure/folder\")\n        .splitsFilePath(\"/path/to/splits/file\")\n        .workingPath(\"/tmp/workingDir\")\n        .useProvidedSplits(false)\n        .mapperGenerator(TextMapperGeneratorImpl.class)\n        .jobInitialiser(new TextJobInitialiser())\n        .minReducers(10)\n        .maxReducers(100)\n        .build();\n\nAdd elements from hdfs main method\nExample content for a main method that takes 5 arguments and runs an AddElementsFromHdfs\nAs Java:\n```java\nif (5 != args.length) {\n    System.err.println(\"Usage: hadoop jar custom-hdfs-import--shaded.jar     \");\n    System.exit(1);\n}\nfinal String inputPath = args[0];\nfinal String outputPath = args[1];\nfinal String failurePath = args[2];\nfinal String schemaPath = args[3];\nfinal String storePropertiesPath = args[4];\nfinal Graph graph = new Graph.Builder()\n        .storeProperties(storePropertiesPath)\n        .addSchemas(Paths.get(schemaPath))\n        .build();\nfinal AddElementsFromHdfs operation = new AddElementsFromHdfs.Builder()\n        .addInputPath(inputPath)\n        .outputPath(outputPath)\n        .failurePath(failurePath)\n        .splitsFilePath(\"/tmp/splits\")\n        .workingPath(\"/tmp/workingDir\")\n        .useProvidedSplits(false)\n        .mapperGenerator(TextMapperGeneratorImpl.class)\n        .jobInitialiser(new TextJobInitialiser())\n        .minReducers(10)\n        .maxReducers(100)\n        .build();\ngraph.execute(operation, new User());\n```\n-----------------------------------------------. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into branch release-0.4.0\n. Merged into develop.\n. For stores that use the vertex serialiser, there is a method on Serialisation called preservesObjectOrdering that can be used to check if the vertices can be used in range scans. If this method returns false then the range scan operation should not be allowed.\nFor stores that don't use the vertex serialiser then we would have to check each seed in the operation is comparable. However, at the moment the range scan operations are specific to the Accumulo store so we could delay doing this part of work for now.. There is a validateOperationChain method in the Store class. Perhaps this could be overridden in AccumuloStore and the extra range operation validation could be applied.\nHowever, a better approach would be to add logic into the AccumuloStore initialise method to check if range operations are applicable for the given Schema (vertex serialiser) and add/remove the range operations as required. This way mean we wouldn't have to apply the validation for every query.. Merged into develop.. Merged into release-0.4.0 branch.\n. Closing the pull request whilst the suggested changes are made.\n. Merged into develop\n. We should add nightly builds to travis to check the different java versions - need to get the Travis cron feature enabled.\n. We now have Travis cron jobs enabled. Just need to configure it - https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/ \n. It's not possible to run a travis cron build with a different .travis.yml. \nWe could use the travis $TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE variable to check whether the job is being run as a cron job (variable set to 'cron'). This would allow us to skip checks when it runs normally and run extra tests for different build environments when run overnight. This approach is a bit brittle. We probably need to investigate using our own CI server. See gh-477.\n. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop\n. Needs some additional tests\n. It could be. However there must be a simpler way of doing it - perhaps by somehow setting a property on the table when a table is created by Gaffer.\n. Looks good but we could really do with some unit tests for the new functionality.\n. Closing pull request whilst we make the suggested changes\n. I think the limit parameter is actually quite useful. It makes it a lot simpler and avoids users having to provide 2 operations when they need to limit their results. It also follows the same pattern we did for deduplicating results.\n. The travis fix I put doesn't return the error code properly so the build is failing but it isn't getting reported correctly. I'll have a look at this now.\nThe errors are due to the new Closable Iterables being merged in (gh-235). Either we need to change your operation handlers to return closable iterables or implement gh-396 first.\n. ## Migration Steps\nThe FreqMap class now is a map of Strings to Longs and is not compatible with the old FreqMap (now called IntegerFreqMap) which was a map of Strings to Integers.\nIf you are currently using the FreqMap (Integer values) then you will need to switch to using IntegerFreqMap, IntegerFreqMapSerialiser and IntegerFreqMapAggregator classes. These classes have all been marked as deprecated and when possible you should switch to using the new FreqMap that handles Long values and the FreqMapSerialiser serialises the values much more efficiently.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop as part of issue gh-388.\n. Looks like the error is caused by that test expecting the schema types to be iterated over in a particular order. However, the types are stored in a HashMap so the order will not be consistent.\nWe need to update the test and possibly others too to not rely on the ordering of the schema types. This basically means if we import and export a schema - the json types may not be in the same order.\nAlternatively, it might be neater to just change the TypeDefinitions HashMap into something like a LinkedHashMap so order is preserved.\n. This has been fixed as part of gh-427. The change has been merged into the develop branch and will be released soon.\n. This has been added to the gaffer-tools repository.\n. Please can you add some migration steps to the issue.\n. We are planning to create a separate Gaffer Tools repository, where all the tools like this, the python shell and the tinkerpop implementation will live.\n. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop.\n. When I was implementing the iterators in the HBase Store I implemented them as 1 big coprocessor. This removes the need to deserialise and serialise multiple times. Perhaps we could do a similar thing in the Accumulo Store?. From doing some simple analysis the changes I have started to make to the accumulo iterators will result in a significant reduction in query times.. # Migration Steps\nThis issue doesn't actually require you to make any changes. However, if you make a few minor changes it could make a bit difference to your performance if you are running on Accumulo. It is really worth reading the optimisations below as in some cases it can easily halve your query times.\nThese are the changes that were actually made in the issue:\n- ValidatorFilter, ElementPreAggregationFilter and ElementPostAggregationFilter accumulo iterators are only applied if they are actually required. I.e there are filters defined in the schema/view.\n- ValidatorFilter, ElementPreAggregationFilter and ElementPostAggregationFilter iterators now lazily deserialise the different accumulo columns. So if you only filter on groupBy properties then we don't need to deserialise all the properties in the Value, just the ones in the column qualifier.\n- The accumulo handler for GetAdjacentIds now only deserialisers the rowId and extracts the destination. Unless the user provides post transform filters.\n- Tidied up some other classes.\nHere are some optimisations when using Accumulo:\nYou can optimise your ValidatorFilter iterator, by removing any unnecessary validation. You can do most of the validation you require in your elements in your ElementGenerator class. The validation you provide in the schema should be just the validation that you actually have to have, because this will be run A LOT: major/minor compactions and for every query. If you can, just validate properties that are in the groupBy, this will mean that the ValidatorFilter doesn't need to deserialise the entire Value to perform the validation.\nWhen doing queries, if you don't specify Pre or Post Aggregation filters then these iterators will be skipped. So, if applicable, you will save time if you put all your filtering in Pre or Post (in some cases this isn't possible). If you want to execute a time window query and your timestamp is a groupBy property or the special timestampProperty then your query will be really fast as again it doesn't need to deserialise the entire Value, just the column qualifier or timestamp.\nWhen doing GetAdjacentIds, try and avoid using PostTransformFilters as if you don't specify these then the final part of the query won't need to deserialise the properties it can just extract the destination off the edge. \nAlso, see optimising-my-queries.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop.\n. We have tested it on tomcat, jetty and wildfly - that is probably enough different types.\n. This has been moved to the gaffer-tools repository - gh-1.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop.\n. I've added an issue gh-502 that moves these options onto GetElements or a new operation GetIterable. So this issue may be automatically resolved with gh-502.\n. If the spark operations require any of these options then they need to be added specifically to the spark operations. \n. These options do really increase the complexity of implementing a new Store. Perhaps we could remove some options or make some of them optional.. # Migration Steps\nThe following options have been removed:\n- populateProperties (this never used to do anything)\n- includeEntities (the view should be used to control if entities are required)\n- includeEdges (the view should be used to control if edges are required)\n- limitResults (users will now have to use the Limit operation)\n- deduplicate (users will now have to use the ToSet operation)\nA 'directedType' option has been added to replace includeEdges, this allows only directed or undirected edges to be filtered.\nThe hierarchy of some of the operations has also changed to try and avoid operations having illegal options. This change led to the removal of all Abstract Operation classes. All operation implementations now just need to implement Operation and any of the following interfaces they wish to make use of:\n- Input\n- Output\n- InputOutput  (Use this instead of Input and Output if your operation takes both input and output.)\n- MultiInput (Use this in addition if you operation takes multiple inputs. This will help with json serialisation)\n- SeedMatching\n- Validatable\n- GraphFilters\n- OperationView\n- SeededGraphFilters\n- Options\nWhen writing a Operation Builder, you need to extend Operation.BaseBuilder and again implement the builders for the interfaces you selected above. See GetElements.Builder for an example.\nA View can now only be set on Get operations. It doesn't make sense for a View to be supplied on operations such as AddElements and GenerateObjects.\nHandlers for operations have now changed slightly due to Operation not haven't an output type. If you have an operation handler for an operation that implements Output. Then your handler should implement OutputOperationHandler instead of OperationHandler.. Merged into develop.\n. Design idea:\nIn the schema, create a new array field called \"indexedProperties\". This would be populated as part of the store specific schema. Properties in a group that should be indexed should be added to this array. If configured to do aggregation, the indexed properties should be a subset of the groupBy property. This is due to the groupBy properties not being aggregated at ingest time so they remain constant. As they are constant they can be indexed easily.\nIn the accumulo store, a new table will be created for each different indexedProperty type. The new tables will be almost an exact copy of the main table, the difference will be that the rowId bytes will be swapped with the indexedProperty bytes. Aggregation and age off/validation should be the same as the main table. Doing this will have a significant performance and storage cost.\nAt query time a user should then be able to specify a property seed to query on. Depending on the property type accumulo will look the element up from the correct table.\nFor example:\nMain table\n\n\nRow ID\nColumn Family\nColumn Qualifier\nVisibility\nTimestamp\nValue\n\n\nsrc|dest|dir\ngroup\ngrpByProp1Value|grpByProp2Value\nvisibility\ntimestamp\nall other properties\n\n\ngrpByProp1 index table\n\n\nRow ID\nColumn Family\nColumn Qualifier\nVisibility\nTimestamp\nValue\n\n\ngrpByProp1Value\ngroup\nsrc|dest|dir|grpByProp2Value\nvisibility\ntimestamp\nall other properties\n\n\ngrpByProp2 index table\n\n\nRow ID\nColumn Family\nColumn Qualifier\nVisibility\nTimestamp\nValue\n\n\ngrpByProp2Value\ngroup\ngrpByProp1Value|src|dest|dir\nvisibility\ntimestamp\nall other properties\n\n\n.

I have started looking into that issue but may take a bit of time to finish it.\n. @d21211122 - do you mind if I finish this issue off?. I have been having a look into the seeds and ids and come up with the following:\nElementId\n    -> EntityId\n        -> EntitySeed\n        -> Entity\n    -> EdgeId\n        -> EdgeSeed\n        -> Edge\nAll operations now refer to IDs instead of seeds. This way you can seed an operation like GetElements with an EntitySeed or Entity.. # Migration Steps\nOK, this doesn't actually require a migration step but this feature does allow you to simplify some of your queries. GetElements operations can now be seeded with Elements.\nFor example if you previously had an operation like:\njava\nfinal OperationChain opChain = new OperationChain.Builder()\n                .first(new GetElements.Builder()\n                        .input(seeds)\n                        .view(new View.Builder()\n                                .edge(\"red\")\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .then(new GetElements.Builder()\n                        .view(new View.Builder()\n                                .entity(\"Cardinality\", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()\n                                        .preAggregationFilter(new ElementFilter.Builder()\n                                                .select(\"edgeGroup\")\n                                                .execute(new IsEqual(CollectionUtil.treeSet(\"blue\")))\n                                                .build())\n                                        .groupBy()\n                                        .postAggregationFilter(new ElementFilter.Builder()\n                                                .select(\"hllp\")\n                                                .execute(new HyperLogLogPlusIsLessThan(5))\n                                                .build())\n                                        .build())\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .then(new GenerateObjects.Builder()\n                        .generator(new EntitySeedExtractor())\n                        .build())\n                .then(new GetElements())\n                .build();\nYou can remove the GenerateObjects step as the entities can be passed straight into the next GetElements operation.. Hi @nickwallen,\nThe changes look great - thanks for tidying the collections up. Before we can accept your pull request, we will need you to agree to our OSS Contributor License. Once you have read through them there is a link at the bottom to send an email to confirm. After we have received the email I will add you to our Contributors team and then I can merge your changes in.\nThanks!\n. Sorry to be a pain, but please could you change your pull request to merge into our develop branch? I have updated our wiki page on pull requests to make this clearer.\n. Merged into develop.\n. I think we are still missing these bits:\nxml\n<shadedArtifactAttached>true</shadedArtifactAttached>\n<shadedClassifierName>[insert name]</shadedClassifierName>\nOnce you have run a mvn clean install, if you look inside your repository in your .m2 folder, the jar names will still have 'shaded' appended.\n. Can you change the pull request to go into the develop branch please.\n. We should add nightly builds to travis to check the different java versions. I'll close the pull request for now and reopen it when we have updated the travis configuration.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Steps\n\nWrite install scripts for yarn/accumulo/gaffer\nMeasure performance of adding data from hdfs (how many elements added per second?)\nWrite install scripts for Gaffer REST API\nMeasure performance of element retrieval from REST API\nMeasure performance of streaming data into Gaffer\nOptimise. @gaffer01 it would be great to get some statistics included before we do version 1.0.0. Merged into develop\n. The spark operations may need refactoring in the future to avoid creating a large number of operations similar to GetElements in different formats/wrappers. For example, we could make use of the Export operation and create different spark exporters.\n\nFor the time being I think it would be best to just move the spark code into separate modules.\nSpark operations and serialisers should be moved into a new module: spark-lib\nThe accumulo spark operation handlers should be moved into a new module: accumulo-spark-operation-handlers\nThen to use accumulo with spark users would need to add a dependency on accumulo-spark-operation-handlers and create an AccumuloStore with a operationsDeclarations.json file similar to this where the spark operations and their handlers are registered. A path to the operationsDeclarations.json file must be a provided in the store.properties file using the key \"gaffer.store.operation.declarations\".\n. Good spot - I had forgotten about the HyperLogLogPlus dependency. Yes I think we need to follow the same pattern for that too. So something like this:\nlibrary\n        - core-library\n        - hdfs-library\n        - spark\n            - spark-library\n            - spark-accumulo-library\n        - sketches-library (hyperloglogplus). # Migration steps\nThe libraries module has been split up into core, hdfs, spark and sketches. To use these you will need to include the relevant dependencies (artifactIds: core-library, hdfs-library, spark-accumulo-library, sketches-library). E.g:\nxml\n <dependency>\n  <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.gaffer</groupId>\n  <artifactId>core-library</artifactId>\n  <version>${gaffer.version}</version>\n</dependency>\nThe accumulo store now depends on the following new libraries: core-library, hdfs-library and sketches-library. So, you now only need to deploy 1 jar to the accumulo iterators:\naccumulo-store-[gaffer.version]-iterators.jar.\nSpark has been separated from the accumulo store so if you require spark you will need to register the operations - see the spark README in the spark library module.. Merged into develop.. I need to add some schema validation to prevent anyone using VERTEX, SOURCE, DESTINATION or DIRECTED as property names.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Most of the above issues have been addressed. The last one is gh-467.. Closing this pull request for now. It needs updating and thoroughly testing first.\n. Merged into develop.\n. Accumulo 1.7.2 depends on Hadoop 2.2.0 so it is probably best to stick with 2.2.0 until we update the version of Accumulo.\n. Let's leave the hadoop version as it is for now and raise a separate issue to update it.\n. Should be done after gh-600.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop\n. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.\n. I think what the issue really wants is to update AbstractAddElementsFromHdfsMapper.java\nIn addition to just logging a warning \njava\nLOGGER.warn(\"Element \" + element + \" did not validate.\");\nwe should update a counter e.g. \njava\ncontext.getCounter(\"Add Elements From HDFS\", \"invalid element count\").increment(1L);\n. I'll close the pull request for now. Just reopen it after the changes have been made.\n. Merged into develop.. This has been merged into develop as part of issue gh-93.. See gh-93 for migration notes.. Yeah we don't currently have tests for the counters. If possible, it would be good to write some as part of this issue.\n. Merged into develop.. This probably involves making a change to the SchemaElementDefinitionValidator validate method. If isAggregate() is false then there should be no groupBy properties.. Merged into develop.. This is the example markdown that is generated:\nExample 8 - Aggregation\nThe code for this example is LoadAndQuery8\nThis example demonstrates the aggregation functionality in Gaffer. Aggregation is applied at ingest and query time.\n1. Ingest aggregation permanently aggregates similar elements together. Elements will be aggregated if:\n   1. An entity has the same group, vertex, visibility and any specified groupBy property values are identical.\n   2. An edge has the same group, source, destination, directed and any specified groupBy property values are identical.\n2. Query aggregation allows additional summarisation depending on a user's visibility permissions and any overridden groupBy properties provided at query time.\nThe data file for this example has simple pairs of integers, as before and each pair has a timestamp and a visibility (public or private):\ncsv\n1,2,01/01/2016 00:00:00,public\n1,2,01/01/2016 00:00:00,private\n1,2,01/01/2016 01:00:00,public\n1,2,01/01/2016 02:00:00,public\n1,2,01/01/2016 03:00:00,public\n1,2,02/01/2016 00:00:00,public\n1,2,02/01/2016 01:00:00,public\n1,2,02/01/2016 02:00:00,public\n1,2,03/01/2016 00:00:00,private\n1,2,04/01/2016 00:00:00,private\n1,3,01/01/2016 00:00:00,public\n1,3,01/01/2016 01:00:00,public\n1,3,02/01/2016 00:00:00,public\n1,3,03/01/2016 00:00:00,public\n1,3,04/01/2016 00:00:00,public\nThe schema is similar to what we have seen before, but we have added a start date and a end date property. These properties have been added to the groupBy field. Properties in the groupBy will be used to determine whether elements should be aggregated together at ingest.\nData schema\njson\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"data\": {\n      \"source\": \"vertex\",\n      \"destination\": \"vertex\",\n      \"directed\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"startDate\": \"date.earliest\",\n        \"endDate\": \"date.latest\",\n        \"count\": \"count.long\",\n        \"visibility\": \"visibility\"\n      },\n      \"groupBy\": [\n        \"startDate\",\n        \"endDate\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"visibilityProperty\": \"visibility\"\n}\nData types\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"vertex\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.Exists\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"date.earliest\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.util.Date\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.Exists\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"date.latest\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.util.Date\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.Exists\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"count.long\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Long\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.Exists\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"true\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsTrue\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"visibility\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.Exists\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nStore types\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"count.long\": {\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.Sum\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"date.earliest\": {\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.ComparableMin\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"date.latest\": {\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.ComparableMax\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"visibility\": {\n      \"serialiserClass\": \"gaffer.example.gettingstarted.serialiser.VisibilitySerialiser\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.example.gettingstarted.function.aggregate.VisibilityAggregator\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nOnce we have loaded the data into Gaffer, we can fetch all the edges using a user that can see both public and private data.\n``` java\n        final GetAllEdges allEdgesOperation = new GetAllEdges();\n    final Iterable<Edge> edges = graph.execute(allEdgesOperation, user);\n\n```\nAll edges:\n```\nEdge{source=1, destination=2, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=private, endDate=Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=5, startDate=Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=2, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=public, endDate=Sun Jan 03 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=3, startDate=Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=2, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=private, endDate=Mon Jan 04 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=1, startDate=Sun Jan 03 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=2, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=private, endDate=Tue Jan 05 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=1, startDate=Mon Jan 04 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=3, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=public, endDate=Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=2, startDate=Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=3, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=public, endDate=Sun Jan 03 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=1, startDate=Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=3, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=public, endDate=Mon Jan 04 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=1, startDate=Sun Jan 03 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=3, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=public, endDate=Tue Jan 05 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=1, startDate=Mon Jan 04 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \n```\nYou will see in the results, the timestamp has been converted into start and end dates - the midnight before and after the timestamp. This effectively creates a time bucket with day granularity. So all edges with a timestamp on the same day have been aggregated together (ingest aggregation). These aggregated edges have had all their properties aggregated together using the aggregate functions specified in the schema. At query time, the query time aggregation merged together similar edges with the same visibility, so 'public' and 'private' edges have become 'private' edges.\nNext we will further demonstrate query time aggregation and get all the 'data' edges with the same source to the same destination to be aggregated together, regardless of the start and end dates. This is achieved by overriding the groupBy field with empty array so no properties are grouped on. Here is the operation:\n``` java\n        final GetAllEdges edgesSummarisedOperation = new GetAllEdges.Builder()\n                .view(new View.Builder()\n                        .edge(\"data\", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()\n                                .groupBy() // set the group by properties to 'none'\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .build();\n    final Iterable<Edge> edgesSummarised = graph.execute(edgesSummarisedOperation, user);\n\n```\nThe summarised edges are as follows:\n```\nEdge{source=1, destination=2, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=private, endDate=Tue Jan 05 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=10, startDate=Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=3, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=public, endDate=Tue Jan 05 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=5, startDate=Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \n```\nWe now have 2 'data' edges, 1 to 2 and 1 to 3. These edges are summaries of all the 'data' edges from 1 to 2 or 1 to 3. You can see the count property has been aggregated.\nIf we apply some pre aggregation filtering, we can return a time window summary of the edges. The new operation looks like:\n``` java\n        final GetAllEdges edgesSummarisedInTimeWindowOperation = new GetAllEdges.Builder()\n                .view(new View.Builder()\n                        .edge(\"data\", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()\n                                .preAggregationFilter(new ElementFilter.Builder()\n                                                .select(\"startDate\")\n                                                .execute(new IsMoreThan(JAN_01_16, true))\n                                                .select(\"endDate\")\n                                                .execute(new IsLessThan(JAN_02_16, true))\n                                                .build()\n                                )\n                                .groupBy() // set the group by properties to 'none'\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .build();\n    final Iterable<Edge> edgesSummarisedInTimeWindow = graph.execute(edgesSummarisedInTimeWindowOperation, user);\n\n```\nThe time window summaries are:\n```\nEdge{source=1, destination=2, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=private, endDate=Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=5, startDate=Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=3, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=public, endDate=Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=2, startDate=Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \n```\nAgain we have 2 edges, but this time the edges only contain data from within the time window of Jan 01 2016 to Jan 02 2016 (inclusive), demonstrating all edges within that window have been summarised together.\nFinally we can repeat the previous time window query, with a user who can only see public data (not private). In this case the summarised edges don't contain any private data.\nThe public time window summaries are:\n```\nEdge{source=1, destination=2, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=public, endDate=Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=4, startDate=Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \nEdge{source=1, destination=3, directed=true, group='data', properties={visibility=public, endDate=Sat Jan 02 00:00:00 GMT 2016, count=2, startDate=Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2016}} \n```\n. Should probably follow the same pattern as with the schema group inheritance in gh-219.. Code is pretty much done on branch gh-519-global-filters. It is branched off gh-219-Schema-group-inheritance so we need to wait for gh-219 to be merged into develop first.. # Migration Steps\nMigration steps\nViews now must be constructed via the view builder - View.Builder class. Once they have been constructed they cannot be modified. To change a view you will need to create new view builder instance, add the old view to the builder and make your changes.\n```java\nnew View.Builder()\n   .merge(oldView)\n   // make your changes\n  .build();\n. Merged into develop\n. If the view contains transient properties then these properties don't have a serialiser or aggregator specified in the view - as they would never be serialised or aggregated. Therefore it wouldn't be possible to automatically create a schema.. @gaffer01 - it isn't possible to implement this fully. Are you happy for me close it?. Rather than adding yet another field to schemas and further complicating them, I think this can be handled by creating pre canned Views, like RedElements, ColouredElements, etc. These pre canned views could be added as NamedViews after this issue is completed: #1542.. Sorry gh-182 did some heavy refactoring of module names, resulting in some conflicts on this branch.\n. The issue wants toString, equals and hashcode methods on all functions, the view and the schema. It looks like there are a few missing?\n. Changes look good. Just wondering how we force new Function implementations to override the toString, hashcode and equals methods? Could we add a test into ConsumerFunctionTest to somehow check these methods have been implemented and all public fields are included in these methods?\n. This would be quite useful alongside code coverage metrics. Perhaps hold off until we have gh-142 done and we can add that badge to the readme too.\n. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop. Closing as after further thought, and as @gaffer01 pointed out, this could be quite confusing.. It would be nice to make the api more like a typical RESTful api, but things like putting the seeds in the url is not possible as there is a limit on the number of characters in a url, therefore users would then be limited to the number of seeds they could supply.\nPerhaps we should rename the REST API to WEB API?. Merged into develop.. Closing this issue as it is only a small amount of code and probably easier and more flexible if users just added the code themselves. Otherwise we would be restricting users to use the group name \"Cardinality\" and properties \"edgeGroup\" and \"cardinality\". We also have other sketches now so different users may want to use different Sketch classes.\n. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Issue #824 added an operation to add elements to Gaffer from Kafka using Flink. I will update this issue to be to export to Kafka.. Merged into develop. Merged into develop.. Still need to configure codecov properly - don't merge it in yet.. Merged into develop.. Merged into hotfix-0.4.6.1. If you add an element with the following property values, no properties will be serialised:\n\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"\"\nThere is a bug such that if that last property is an empty string or empty map then the serialisation will be skipped an no values will be stored.. Merged into hotfix-0.4.6.2 and hotfix-0.4.7.2.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Most of the rest api is tested via the proxy store integration tests.. Merged into develop.. Hi @dwd,\nThanks for fixing the javadoc links. We would really like to merge your pull request in, but before we can accept your pull request, we will need you to agree to our OSS Contributor License. Once you have read through them there is a link at the bottom to send an email to confirm. After we have received the email I will add you as an outside collaborator then I can merge your changes in.\nThanks!. I've just noticed that your changes are applied to our master branch and we had actually already fixed the javadoc links on our develop branch a few weeks ago. \nI'm going to close this pull request as these javadoc fixes will be merged into master when we next do a release (0.5.0). Sorry not to able to accept your pull request, but I hope this won't put you off from raising other pull requests in the future. \nPlease see our Ways of Working wiki page for information on our git branching strategy and creating pull requests.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. @gaffer01 - I've updated it with your suggested changes. Thanks.. I have written tests for the new functionality, but the test coverage has gone down slightly due to a couple extra lines to catch an IOException that could be thrown by HyperLogLogPlus. It is not simple to invoke this exception so I don't think it is necessary to test it.. @gaffer01 - I've made the suggested changes.. They will be updated as we change files to 2016-2017.. If the bytes are empty then the hyperLogLogPlus object must have been null to start with.\nTherefore when empty bytes are deserialised the result should be null.\nThe deserialiseEmptyBytes method should just return null.. Closing pull request until changes have been made.. Sorry I merged the serialisation interface changes in. I will fix your branch for you.. I've renamed isByteOrderPreserved to preservesObjectOrdering in the serialisers. I have just removed the method as it wasn't used.. @gaffer01 - good spot. I have renamed the test methods.. I think this requires gh-499 to be merged in first. Closing the pull request for the time being.. Travis CI is killing the job. It is either using too much memory or using too many threads.\nThis is most likely due to the addition of the integration tests and requiring a server with the Gaffer REST API to to be started. However, the chunking rest api code also creates new threads.. I've removed the integration tests from Travis CI, they will still be run in Jenkins. This will have a big impact on our test coverage.. Merged into develop.. Closing this as I don't think moving to Jackson version 2.3.1 is a good idea as it is quite old and we lose several a few features. Also it would be incompatible with several libraries such as spark.. I've addressed the review comments - with the exception of the 400/500 status one. The 400/500 status will be address as part of issue gh-656. Merged into develop.. Thanks for raising the bug. That visibility serialiser is only in the test jars as it just used for testing. Therefore it is not included in the accumulo-iterators jar that is deployed to accumulo, which is why accumulo is not able to find the serialiser.\nI hadn't really imagined the integration tests would ever actually be run against a real cluster, but it does seem like a nice way of testing your cluster is setup correctly. \nIf you deploy the accumulo-store-[version]-tests.jar to your cluster and rerun the tests - do they pass?.

We need to apply the same shading to the library modules, e.g https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/blob/develop/library/bitmap-library/pom.xml. ## Migration Steps\nThe side effect of shading the iterators jar means any other custom jars containing serialisers/functions that are added to Accumulo's classpath that use jackson will also need to be shaded in the same way.

Merged into develop. That seems strange - what version of Gaffer are you using? In the latest version of Gaffer (0.6.1) GetRelatedEdges is deprecated and has been replaced with GetEdges.. Just looked a few older versions of Gaffer. I was able to replicate your issue on versions pre 0.5.0, before we made the changes GetEdges. On versions before 0.5.0 you will need to use GetRelatedEdges as you suggested. \nThe wiki is update for each release we do and currently is aimed at release 0.6.1. You can view the wiki pages for older versions here: https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/wiki/Operation-examples/_history\nPlease get in touch if you have any further problems.. Merged into develop.. Closing pull request until I have added some more tests and a walkthrough to the getting started guide.. Merged into develop.. I haven't seen this occur before. Please could you provide the following so I can try and work out what is happening:\n- the version of Gaffer you are using\n- your full schema\n- the elements you added\n- the query you are doing and the results you get back\nThanks.. OK, thanks for the details. I'll try and replicate the issue and get back to you soon.. Just having a look at your schema and it looks like you are missing a few things? Perhaps you missed some bits off when you sent it? When you add the GafferPopVertex, you set a value for the \"description\" property, but in your schema there isn't a \"description\" property.\nPlease could you also provide the dataTypes.json file (or the part of the schema containing all the types information). For each type used in the schema, e.g. \"string\", \"weight\", \"entity\", \"true\" you need to tell Gaffer what those types are. See types. Also, you need to decide on how values of those types should be aggregated together. When you added the same GafferPopVertex twice Gaffer will merge the 2 entities together using the aggregator functions provided in the schema. I updated your schema to this:\njson\n{\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"entity\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"visibility\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"groupBy\": [\"type\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"knows\": {\n      \"source\": \"entity\", \"destination\": \"entity\", \"directed\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"weight\": \"weight\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"learns\": {\n      \"source\": \"entity\", \"destination\": \"entity\", \"directed\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"weight\": \"weight\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"types\": {\n    \"type\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.StringConcat\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"string\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.StringConcat\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"weight\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Double\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.Max\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"entity\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.StringConcat\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"true\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsTrue\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"visibilityProperty\": \"visibility\"\n}\nand it seems to work ok. \nI used the StringConcat aggregator function to merge \"string\" properties together. The StringConcat function isn't very clever and I wouldn't recommend it. If you add the same entity twice it will simply comma separate the \"string\" properties together even if they are the same. \nA better approach would be to either implement your own Aggregate Function (see StringConcat as an example) - doing this you could decide exactly how 2 strings should be merged together. Or use a java.util.TreeSet containing strings instead of just a String. This way string property values are deduplicated nicely for you, but it adds a bit more complexity to adding and fetching properties. E.g:\njson\n{\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"entity\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"visibility\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"string.set\"\n      },\n      \"groupBy\": [\"type\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"knows\": {\n      \"source\": \"entity\", \"destination\": \"entity\", \"directed\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"weight\": \"weight\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"learns\": {\n      \"source\": \"entity\", \"destination\": \"entity\", \"directed\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"weight\": \"weight\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"types\": {\n    \"type\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.StringConcat\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"string\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.StringConcat\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"weight\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Double\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.Max\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"entity\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.StringConcat\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"string.set\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.util.TreeSet\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.SetAggregator\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"true\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsTrue\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"visibilityProperty\": \"visibility\"\n}\nWhen you add a \"description\" property now you will need to do:\njava\nfinal TreeSet<String> description = new TreeSet<>();\ndescription.add(\"A guy who does the thing for the stuff.\"\");\nv1.property(VertexProperty.Cardinality.list, \"description\", description);. No problem. If there is anything in the docs that don't make sense, please raise an issue and we will get them updated.\nI haven't updated the version of Gaffer in the Tinkerpop implementation for a while, as I assumed no one was really going to use it as it is just a prototype and the performance isn't as great. I can update it tomorrow if that is helpful for you? There are some quite big breaking changes in Gaffer from 0.4.7 to 0.6.1, you would need to do a bit of migration but would be useful to do it before you get to tied to 0.4.7. . I've just pushed up the changes to master so it now depends on Gaffer 0.6.1. To migrate, the easiest thing to do is just to delete your Accumulo table as your Gaffer 0.4.7 data will not be compatible with Gaffer 0.6.1. Other migration steps can be found here: https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/releases . OK that seems very strange. I've created a branch in gaffer-experimental containing your schema and sample code. I wrote a quite test that adds your vertices and edge twice then does a query and the data comes back aggregated as expected. Here it is: https://github.com/gchq/gaffer-experimental/blob/gh-739-aggregation/tinkerpop/src/test/java/gaffer/gafferpop/CustomGafferPopGraphTest.java.\nThe output is:\n```\nv[entity-id_123]\nProperties: \n    visibility=Public\n    description=This should work.,This should work.\n    type=first_type\nv[entity-id_999]\nProperties: \n    visibility=Public\n    description=But it isn't for some reason.,But it isn't for some reason.\n    type=second_type\ne[id_123-knows->id_999]\nProperties: \n    weight=0.5\n```\nThis is running on the old version of Gaffer, which I believe is the same version you are using. I can't think what else it might be. Perhaps you have some configuration issue with your cluster. . OK, so I think we have got to the bottom of your issue. It is likely to be related to gh-757, where the schema wasn't being validated correctly. If you want aggregation, then you must provide an aggregator for each property type in your schema. If you don't then the schema is invalid. Previously the schema was not validated correctly and missed aggregators meant at query time the properties would disappear - as you discovered. I will close this bug as it will be fixed as part of issue gh-757. \n.

Merged into develop-0.7.0. # Migration Steps\nInstead of using GetEdges and GetEntities, you will now need to use GetElements with a View containing the entity and/or edge groups you want. See GetElements example.. Closing while I tidy up some of the operation interfaces. Most of the integration tests currently use the same schema - which has aggregation. We would need to create another integration test class similar to VisibilityIT that uses a different schema with no aggregation. \nA very basic test would be to Call AddElements with an Edge twice, then call GetAllElements and you should get the Edge back twice.. Merged into develop.. Thanks @gaffer01 I'll get them fixed.. I've made the requested changes.. @gaffer01 - I agree. I have raised a separate issue to refactor the code to remove the hard dependency on Koryphe functions: gh-820.. As part of this issue we should also move the functions in core-library to the koryphe library.. I've created a koryphe repository ready.. The code has been added to the develop branch in the koryphe repo. Once koryphe version 0.1.0 has been released we can remove the koryphe code out of the Gaffer repository.. # Migration steps\nA large number of functions, aggregators and transforms have now been moved into the Koryphe library. This has meant we have had to rename the packages for these functions.\ne.g\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.filter.IsMoreThan\n-> uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsMoreThan\nWe have also renamed packages so they match the Java 8 function interfaces:\nfilter -> predicate\naggregate -> binaryoperator\ntransform -> function\ne.g\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.theta.function.aggregator.UnionAggregator\n-> uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.theta.binaryoperator.UnionAggregator\nNote that some fields have also been renamed to maintain a consistent naming pattern and that this will affect any serialised JSON.\ne.g\n```\n \"postTransformFilterFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"function\": {\n            \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.ExampleFilterFunction\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n->\n\"postTransformFilterFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"predicate\": {\n            \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.ExampleFilterFunction\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n```\nIf you have any custom predicates/binaryoperators/functions then you may need to add a dependency on the koryphe test jar so your unit tests can extend the koryphe abstract test classes:\nxml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.koryphe</groupId>\n    <artifactId>koryphe</artifactId>\n    <version>0.1.0</version>\n    <type>test-jar</type>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\nSee the predicate  examples for further details..

Merged into develop.. There are a couple of merge conflicts - I'll fix them. This should be fairly easy now we have the AggregatorUtil class. We just need to be careful to only apply query aggregation if we need to, to avoid unnecessary processing.. Can this be implemented in a similar way to how we did it in the Parquet Store using the VisibilityEvaluator class?. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop. This has been moved to the koryphe repository gh-3. This would be a very hard, time consuming task. I'm not sure it will be worth it.. Closing for now as we don't really have a strong requirement for decoupling it.. This is similar to gh-849.\nShould the sort operation also work on other objects, not just elements? If so we would either need the object to be comparable or we need to provide a comparator as part of the operation. As discussed in gh-849 we may then need a library of comparators that users can use over the rest api. \nOr, perhaps we have 2 sort operations. A simple SortElements that sorts based on a comparable property value and a Sort operation that requires a comparator to be provided.. It might be useful to have a \"reverse\" field on the operation to reverse the sorting order.\nIf a user only wants the top 5 results, it would be wasteful to load all the results into memory and sort them all. To help with this we could add a \"resultLimit\" field to the operation so that the operation handler could just hold a small number of top results in memory.. Merged into develop..

We have added the following operations:\nAddElementsFromFile\nAddElementsFromKafka\nAddElementsFromSocket\nBe default these operations are not registered.

Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. This is a duplicate of gh-267. I will add your comment to that issue.. I agree. Although it is shame we have to duplicate the Java API stream functions, there should be very little code required.\nFor example to implement a Max operation the following would be required:\nMax operation class that takes a Comparator  and implements:\n        Operation,\n        InputOutput, T>,\n        MultiInput\nMaxHandler the operation handler for the Max operation. This could take the Iterable input convert to a stream and call max with the provided comparator.\nMaxExample and example of the Max operation for the wiki documentation.\nThe issue with this Max operation is ensuring users can provide a comparator over the rest api. Which may result in another library of comparators being required. I can envisage a comparator such as given 2 Elements, extract the \"count\" properties as Longs and compare them. This could apply to any property that is comparable. . Operations Min and Max have been added as part of this issue. If Sum or any other operations are required then please raise separate issues. . Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. I don't think we would ever want any other JobTracker implementations apart from the GafferCacheJobTracker. If you wish to use the JobTracker with a different cache you would do that by writing a CacheService implementation instead. So we should make the JobTracker a concert class and put the GafferCacheJobTracker logic in there. Similarly with NamedOperations. You will need to do a bit of shuffling around of the code to sort of the dependency hierarchy of modules as currently JobTracker is in the Operation module.\nStoreProperties will need to be updated:\ngaffer.store.job.tracker.class can be removed\ngaffer.store.job.tracker.config.path should be changed to be the general cache config path\nWe may need to add a boolean property to enable/disable the job tracker.. Closing while the changes are implemented.. Looks good. Please could you add some migration steps to the issue gh-763.. Merged into develop.. Sorry, I've just seen your message. Thanks for the contribution \ud83d\udc4d I've just merged it into our develop branch and it will be released in version 0.7.0.. Please can we also make sure the stack trace is always logged.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Hi @goti921,\nYeah go for it, thanks! \n@GCHQDeveloper404 has completed the toString part of the issue, I'm not sure how much is actually left to do. Please branch off the develop branch and refer to our ways of working wiki page.\nLet me know if you have any questions.. Merged into develop-1.0.0.. I've added the output user-guide and dev-guide to the wiki: \nhttps://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/wiki/User-Guide-0.7.0\nhttps://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/wiki/Dev-Guide-0.7.0\nSome of the links within the walkthroughs won't work until Gaffer 0.7.0 has been released and is on the master branch.. Replaced with pull request: https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/900. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. The issue was actually mainly around the validation of the Or and And predicates. This has now been fixed in Koryphe 0.1.1. So to fix this issue we will need to update to Koryphe 0.1.1.. Merged into develop.. @morrme that would be great, thanks.\nHere are our notes on pull requests.. Merged into develop.. @morrme sorry I've only just seen your comment above.. Merged into develop.. I've split out the code base into separate sections so they can be run in parallel on different travis VMs. We should monitor the builds and check whether we need to split them out further. Currently:\n\ncode analysis of whole code base\ntest everything except hbase and accumulo\ntest accumulo\ntest hbase\n. Closing this for now as the build seems to be ok.. This has been done in #1341 . Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. # Migration Steps\nThe method deserialiseEmptyBytes in the Serialisation interface has been renamed to deserialiseEmpty.\n\nSerialisation has been renamed to Serialiser.\nAccumulo and HBase now requires all provided serialisers to implement ToBytesSerialiser. Merged into develop.. # Migration steps\nThe core-library has been removed and the contents have been added to the core/serialiser and core/type modules. These will be included automatically in all Gaffer Stores so you can remove your dependency on the core-library.. # Migration Steps\nThe UI has been moved to the gaffer-tools projects. The maven groupId and artifactId will not be affected.. Merged into develop. We can't use the try with resources for a lot of the cases as we only want to close the input if there is an exception thrown. I think the try with resources would always close the input at the end of the try statement. We need the input to stay open until the output of the operation chain has been consumed by the user, either via REST or java.. Hi @morrme,\nThanks for making the change. Before we can merged you pull request in, we will need you to sign our Contributor-License-Agreement. There is a link at the bottom of there to send an email. \nI know it seems silly to have to sign it for a pull request that just involves removing a line of code. But, you just have to sign it once and you will then be able to make contributions to any of GCHQ's OSS projects.\nThanks again.. Ah sorry I missed the email. \nWe just need an email containing the following with your full name and GitHub ID:\n```\nI hereby agree to the terms of GCHQ Open Source Contributor License Agreement V1.0.\nFull name:\nGitHub ID:\n```. Thank you very much.\nIf you would like any help getting started with any of the other issues then please let me know. As you probably noticed we have started to label issues as beginner and intermediate, so picking some of them would probably be best.\nAs you did, if you want to work on any of the issues just add a comment to the issue and hopefully that will prevent anyone else doing it.. I have done a bit of work on this on branch gh-892-map-store-impl but it looks like there are several issues that need investigating. \nI branched off the gh-763-cache branch as that is due to be merged in soon and it contains some hazelcast bits in that I thought might be useful.. As part of this issue the following has been done:\n\nadded a MapFactory so users can provide a more complex map implementation like Hazelcast or MapDB.\nelements are now split up into different maps based on their groups\nnon aggregated and aggregated elements are now in separate maps\nadded a store property to configure batching elements up and applying aggregation before adding them to the existing map store. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. We should wait until we next plan to do a major release before we make this change, due to the migration required.. Rather than doing this, bytes will be the default output type. All serialisers that serialise into anything other than bytes should have a class named accordingly. So for serialisers that output bytes we don't need to put ToBytes in the class name.. Sorry @t616178 , I've finished tinkering with your branch now. Please could check you have happy with the changes I made.. This will be done as part of issue #406.. Merged into develop as part of #406.. Merged into develop.. Thanks @t616178 for correcting the typos - looks good.. Any class that is public facing should have a class javadoc. Any complex methods in those classes should also have a javadoc.\n\nWe can all collaborate on this issue and work on the same branch:\ngh-910-javadoc. Merged into develop.. To implement the change I basically just changed the directed boolean on EdgeId to be a nullable Boolean. So it is now optional to specify the directed field on an EdgeSeed when doing a query.. Closing whilst we investigate switching to use an Enum to represent the directed flag - 'DIRECTED', 'UNDIRECTED' or 'EITHER'.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. @t616178 happy with the changes?. Merged into develop.. @gaffer01 don't think so, it would make more sense to use the same. I'll make that change now, thanks.. @gaffer01 happy with the changes?. Closing until the conflicts have been addressed.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. # Migration steps\nYou will need to update your JCS cache.ccf config files according to: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jcs/UpgradingFrom13.html\nPlease note there is a bug in JCS version 2.0 so if you plan on using JCS age off then it won't currently work until we update to JCS version 2.1. See #970.. Merged into develop.. Ah, good spot - yes the groupId should be \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer\".\nThanks for pointing them out.. Merged into the develop branch and will be released as part of version 0.7.4.. # Migration Steps\nWhen creating an instance of Graph (or initialising a Store) you must provide a graphId. This is a unique identifier String for your Graph. You can now configure your store to persist the graphId and schema you initialise it with, so following calls to instantiate a Graph do not need to provide the schema again.\nThe graphId must be provided when constructing a Graph, e.g:\njava\nreturn new Graph.Builder()\n    .graphId(\"graph1\")\n    .storeProperties(storeProperties)\n    .addSchema(schema)\n    .build();\nWhen using the rest api, you will need to set the 'gaffer.graph.id' system property.\nA graphId can contain: letters, numbers and underscores (regex = [a-zA-Z0-9_]*).\nThe table name store property for Accumulo and HBase has been removed. This has been replaced with the graphId. Please remove the table name property out of your store.properties file and use a graphId when you construct an instance of Graph instead.. Merged into develop.. New section for wiki:\nFederatedStore\nThe code for this example is FederatedStoreWalkThrough.\nThe FederatedStore is simply a Gaffer store which forwards operations to a collection of sub-graphs and returns a single response as though it was a single graph.\nThis example explains how to create a FederatedStore, add/remove additional graphs, with/without authentication and call operations against the FederatedStore.\nConfiguration\nTo create a FederatedStore you need to initialise the store with a graphId and a properties file.\njava\nfinal Graph federatedGraph = new Graph.Builder()\n        .config(new GraphConfig.Builder()\n                .graphId(\"federatedRoadUse\")\n                .library(new HashMapGraphLibrary())\n                .build())\n        .storeProperties(StreamUtil.openStream(getClass(), \"federatedStore.properties\"))\n        .build();\nAdding Graphs\nYou can't add a graph using a graphId already in use, you will need to explicitly remove the old GraphId first.\nYou can limit access to the sub-graphs when adding to FederatedStore, see Limiting Access.\nTo load a graph into the FederatedStore you need to provide:\n * GraphId\n * Graph Schema\n * Graph Properties\nNote Schema & Properties are not required if GraphId is known by the GraphLibrary\nUsing either the FederatedStore properties file...\n```\ngaffer.store.class=uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.federatedstore.FederatedStore\ngaffer.store.properties.class=uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.store.StoreProperties\ngaffer.federatedstore.customPropertiesAuths=,\ngaffer.federatedstore.graphIds=, \ngaffer.federatedstore..properties.file=\ngaffer.federatedstore..schema.file=\ngaffer.federatedstore..properties.id=\ngaffer.federatedstore..schema.id=\n```\nor through the AddGraph operation.

Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. In the case then aggregation is disabled the elements should not be grouped together and aggregated.\nSo, what should we do in the case that aggregation is disabled for the element?\ne.g\n!schema.getElement(element.getGroup()).isAggregate()\nIn the view we don't know anything about the schema, so can we rely on the method calling this getGroupByFunction() to check? . @d47853 thanks for making the changes. \nBefore merging it in, I'm going to add some extra methods to the branch.. I've added the extra methods/classes. We just need to test them.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. I've updated your branch to make the sets json serialisable. Please could you check you are happy with my changes. It looks like I have changed a lot, I've just done:\nrenamed get() to getTimestamps()\nadded builders for the 2 timestamp sets to allow the json deserialisation to work\nadded a new dependency on jackson-datatype-jsr310 so jackson can serialisation/deseriable Instant objects\nadded/updated the toString, equals, hashcode methods. I think it is better than using the default equals on Object. I've added a javadoc to the equals and hash code methods.. This may conflict with changes in issue https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/864 so it might be worth waiting until that issue is finished.. It would be nice if we could set it to the more verbose style when in debug mode. . I would like to get this issue done in the next release. We can just apply the same changes to the #864 branch later.. Merged into develop.. # Migration Steps\nIf you have an existing table in accumulo or hbase and your schema does not have serialisers defined for all of your properties and vertices then you will need to add them in manually rather than relying on Gaffer to select them for you. This is because there have been changes to which serialisers it would automatically select for you.\nThe Serialisation Factories were updated to replace the deprecated raw serialisers with the new ordered serialisers. This will break the serialisation of all the serialised data that has been serialised with the Raw Serialisers and have not explicitly defined them in their schema. This would occur due to new serialisation factory selecting the new serialiser, which will not be compatible with the existing serialised bytes.. @james010101101 is this still required? Have you done any work on it?. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Closing while I add some more tests.. # Migration steps\nIf you have any custom operations then you will need to make some minor changes.\nAdd the Required annotation to any required Operation fields.\nUpdate your tests for your custom operations as follows:\nOperationTest is now an abstract class, so for any custom Operation tests classes you will need to change:\njava\npublic class CustomOperationTest implements OperationTest\njava\npublic class CustomOperationTest extends OperationTest\nImplement the new test method, getOperationClass(). For example:\njava\n@Override\npublic Class<? extends Operation> getOperationClass() {\n    return CustomOperation.class;\n}\nIf you have required fields then override the test method getRequiredFields() and return a Set containing the field names. For example:\njava\n@Override\nprotected Set<String> getRequiredFields() {\n    return Sets.newHashSet(\"requiredField1\", \"requiredField2\");\n}\n. Merged into develop.. @gaffer01 thanks for reviewing this. I've made your suggested changes.. This is the main class to focus on: AddElementsFromHdfsHandler. See the migration steps for the issue https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/328 for a list of the significant changes.. @gaffer01 - thanks, good spot. I've created a workingPath field on AddElementsFromHdfs and we will use that instead of the /tmp.. I think we should add a \"numSplits\" field to SampleDataForSplitPoints as it might be useful for other store implementations.\nIf a user wants to skip the Sample and Split they can provide their own splits and set useProvidedSplits to true.\nClosing while we implement the above.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. @gaffer01 thanks, I've fixed the typo.. @james010101101 please could you have a look at these changes too?. @gaffer01 perhaps yeah. I'm not quite sure how that would look though.\nCurrently admins can enable/disable any operations by providing an operations declarations file when the store is initialised. This feature is hidden away a bit but it is possible.. I think there are some operations like AddElementsFromHdfs, AddElementsFromRdd, GetRddOfElements etc. that should not be executed over the rest api. It would be nice if there was a way the core rest api could disable these operations rather than every admin having to write their own operation declaration file to disable them. I could write an operation declarations file that disables the Accumulo ones: AddElementsFromHdfs.class, SplitStoreHandler, SampleDataForSplitPoints.class, ImportAccumuloKeyValueFiles.class and then this would need to be added to the accumulo store properties when used in the REST API. . OK I'll try using the operation declarations to disable them. I'll close this pull request for now.. @m55624 thanks for adding the null test and fixing the bug. Looks good.. @m55624 it is not really applicable to other stores, so I think it would be better to just keep it in the HBase and Accumulo store classes.. When a graph is initialised and you are using a Graph Library then it will check to see if the graphId already exists, if it does and the schema or store properties is different then it will error. This will be handled for you in the GraphLibrary.\nThe graph library will be added in the next pull request, until then, the graphId isn't really used for anything, just by Accumulo/HBase for the table name.\nReally the main use for this graphId is so we can do issue #955 and #287.. Merged into develop.. OK - I'm happy for the examples to be updated in a separate issue - can you create that? Your changes look nice.. Thanks for pointing that out! I'll fix that now.. /latest sounds useful\nYeah I think we will need to expose both versions in swagger.\nStandardising the responses would be sensible, but only for the new version of the rest api.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Ah another good spot, thanks @ddseapy! I'll fix that now.\nJust in case you hadn't realised - that Aggregation markdown file you provided a link to is compiled and added to the Gaffer wiki here: https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/wiki/User-Guide#aggregation.\nThe reason visibility isn't mentioned in the Aggregation section is mainly just because we don't introduce the concept of visibilities until later on in the Dev-Guide (just to keep things simpler). However, I will update the wording in the Dev-Guide visibility section to mention aggregation.\nThe Accumulo and HBase stores basically treat Visibility properties as another groupBy property (except it is stored in a different column). So at ingest it will not merge elements with different visibility values together. At query time Accumulo and HBase then effectively remove the Visibility property from the groupBy and summarises the elements with the different visibilities together.\nFor example:\nYou add these Edges:\n1 -> 2   count = 1, visibility = \"public\"\n1 -> 2   count = 2, visibility = \"public\"\n1 -> 2   count = 10, visibility = \"private\"\n1 -> 2   count = 20, visibility = \"private\"\nThese are persisted keeping the Edges with different visibilities separate, you can see the counts have been aggregated as they are not a groupBy property:\n1 -> 2   count = 3, visibility = \"public\"\n1 -> 2   count = 30, visibility = \"private\"\nThen if a user with just \"public\" access to the system does a query they will just get back:\n1 -> 2   count = 3, visibility = \"public\"\nA user with \"private\" access, who by definition can also see \"public\" data, will get back both edges aggregated together:\n1 -> 2   count = 33, visibility = \"private\"\n. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. The columns are set for these operations using the InputConfigurator.fetchColumns method in the AccumuloStore.updateConfiguration method.\n@gaffer01 - can this issue be closed?. 1 - When we wrote the Koryphe library to handle the aggregation/filtering we thought about allowing multiple properties to be passed to a single aggregator function. It adds additional complexity and we didn't have a use case for it so we chose just to implement the basics initially. With validation and filtering we allow multiple properties to be passed to a Predicate by using KoryphePredicate2, KoryphePredicate3, etc. So, we could follow this same pattern create similar classes for aggregating multiple properties. I'll open up a separate issue and put some more information in that issue to describe how it would work.\n2 - Ah sorry, yes we are missing a 'migration' section in the Accumulo Store README. I'll create a separate issue to add some documentation for that. In the meantime... here are the limitations:\nYou can do the following:\n- add new groups\n- add new non-groupBy properties (including visibility and timestamp), but they must go after the other properties\n- rename properties\n- change aggregators\n- change validators\n- change descriptions\nYou cannot do the following:\n- rename groups\n- remove any properties (groupBy, non-groupBy, visibility or timestamp)\n- add new groupBy properties\n- reorder any of the properties. In the Accumulo store we don't use any property names, we just rely on the order the properties are defined in the schema.\n- change the way properties or vertices are serialised - i.e don't change the serialisers.\n- change which properties are groupBy\nPlease note, that the validation functions in the schema can be a bit dangerous. If an element is found to be invalid then the element will be permanently deleted from the table. So, be very careful when making changes to your schema that you don't accidentally make all your existing elements invalid as you will quickly realise all your data has been deleted. For example, if you add a new property 'prop1' and set the validateFunctions to be a single Exists predicate. Then when that Exists predicate is applied to all of your existing elements, those old elements will fail validation and be removed.\nIf you have existing data, then before doing any form of upgrade or change to your table I would strongly recommend using the accumulo shell to clone the table so you have a backup so you can easily restore to that version if things go wrong. Even if you have an error like the one above where all your data is deleted in your table you will still be able to quickly revert back to your backup. Cloning a table in Accumulo is very simple and fast (it doesn't actually copy the data). If you have a table called 'table1', you can do something like the following in the Accumulo shell\n```bash\n\noffline -t table1\nclone table table1 table1-backup\noffline -t table1-backup\n\nDo your upgrades\n- deploy new gaffer jars to accumulo\n- run the AddUpdateTableIterator class to update table1\n\nonline -t table1\n\nCheck table1 is still healthy:\n- run a query and check the iterators are successfully aggregating and filtering elements correctly.\n\ndroptable -t table1-backup\n```. Requirement for this came from #1058.. OK, I've pretty much finished implementing the change. The change has added an extra section to the Schema but this is optional so hopefully it won't complicate things for novice users of Gaffer. There was a bit of complexity around the change due to not be able to aggregation multiple properties together if they are stored in different places. For example - we will not allow groupBy and non-groupBy properties to be aggregated using the same BinaryOperator.\n\nI've done a bit of updating of the Schemas to encourage users to just have 2 schema files - Elements Schema and Types Schema. Then if they need advanced aggregation or validation they can do that in separate files, Aggregation Schema and Validation Schema. I've also updated the documentation for the wiki. Below is the output that will be added to the wiki if this branch is accepted and merged in.\nSchemas\nThe code for this example is Schemas.\nThis example delves into more detail on Schemas. As we have seen previously there are 2 main components to schemas: the Elements schema and the Types schema.\nIt is worth remembering that your schema can be broken up further if required. \nFor example if you have a Graph that is made up of 5 different data sources, you may find it easier to develop and maintain by splitting your schema into multiple parts, for example 5 Element Schemas and 1 Types schema.\nWhen you construct your Gaffer graph you must provide all the Schema parts. These will then be merged together to form a 'master' schema for the Graph.\nWe will talk through some more of the features you can add to your Schemas to make them more readable and to model your data more accurately.\nElements schema\nThe elements schema is designed to be a high level document describing what information your Graph contains - like the different types of edges and entities and the list of properties associated with each.\nEssentially this part of the schema should just be a list of all the entities and edges in the graph. \nEdges describe the relationship between a source vertex and a destination vertex. \nEntities describe a vertex. We use the term \"element\" to mean either and edge or and entity.\nWhen defining an element we must provide a \"group\". This is a unique string that defines the type of an element.\nGroups must be completely unique and cannot be shared between edges and entities.\nEdges must have the following:\n- source - this is the type of object that will be used as the source vertex in your graph. The value here is a string similar to a property type (it could be the same type as a property type).\n- destination - similar to source, it can either be the same or a different type.\n- directed - we need to tell Gaffer if the edge is directed or undirected. Currently, the easiest way to do this is to create a type called \"true\", \"false\" and define that type in the Type schema as being a boolean with a filter predicate to check the boolean is true or false\nEntities must have a vertex field - this is similar to the source and destination fields on an edge.\nEdges and Entities can optionally have the following fields:\n- description - this is a simple string that should provide some context and explain what the element is.\n- parents - this should be an array of parent group names. Note - the parent groups must relate to the same element type as the child, for example an edge cannot have an entity as a parent. Elements can inherit any information from multiple parent elements - fields will be merged/overridden so the order that you defined your parents is important. Any fields that are defined in the child element will also merge or override information taken from the parents.\n- properties - Properties are be defined by a map of key-value pairs of property names to property types. The property type should be described in the Types schema.\n- groupBy - by default Gaffer will use the element group and it's vertices to group similar elements together in order to aggregate and summarise the elements. This groupBy field allows you to specify extra properties that should be used in addition to the element group and vertices to control when similar elements should be grouped together and summarised.\n- visibilityProperty - if you are using visibility properties in your graph, then ensure the sensitive elements have a visibility property and then set this visibilityProperty field to that property name so Gaffer knows to restrict access to this element.\n- timestampProperty - if you are using timestamp property in your graph, then set this timestampProperty field to that property name so Gaffer knows to treat that property specially.\n- aggregate - this is true by default. If you would like to disable aggregation for this element group set this to false.\nThese 2 optional fields are for advanced users. They can go in the Elements Schema however, we have split them out into separate Schema files Validation and Aggregation so the logic doesn't complicate the Elements schema.\n- validateFunctions - an array of selections and predicates to be applied to an element. This allows you to validate based on multiple properties at once - like check a timestamp property together with a time to live property to check if the element should be aged off. Individual property validation is best done as a validateFunction in the property type definition in Types schema.\n- aggregateFunctions - an array of selections and binary operators to be applied to an element. This allows you to aggregate based on multiple properties at once. It is important to note that different types of properties (groupBy, non-groupBy, visibility, timestamp) cannot be aggregated in the same aggregate function. Individual property aggregation is best done as a aggregateFunction in the property type definition in the Types schema.\nHere is an example of an Elements schema\njson\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"RoadUse\": {\n      \"description\": \"A directed edge representing vehicles moving from junction A to junction B.\",\n      \"source\": \"junction\",\n      \"destination\": \"junction\",\n      \"directed\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"startDate\": \"date.earliest\",\n        \"endDate\": \"date.latest\",\n        \"count\": \"count.long\"\n      },\n      \"groupBy\": [\n        \"startDate\",\n        \"endDate\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"RoadHasJunction\": {\n      \"description\": \"A directed edge from each road to all the junctions on that road.\",\n      \"source\": \"road\",\n      \"destination\": \"junction\",\n      \"directed\": \"true\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"Cardinality\": {\n      \"description\": \"An entity that is added to every vertex representing the connectivity of the vertex.\",\n      \"vertex\": \"anyVertex\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"edgeGroup\": \"set\",\n        \"hllp\": \"hllp\",\n        \"count\": \"count.long\"\n      },\n      \"groupBy\": [\n        \"edgeGroup\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nHere is the Validation Schema. It contains advanced validation, that is applied to multiple properties within an Element group.\njson\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"RoadUse\": {\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"selection\": [\n            \"startDate\",\n            \"endDate\"\n          ],\n          \"predicate\": {\n            \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsXLessThanY\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nHere is the Aggregation Schema. It contains advanced aggregation, that is applied to multiple properties within an Element group.\nThe multi property aggregate function defined here overrides the relevant single property aggregate functions defined in the Types schema.\njson\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"RoadUse\": {\n      \"aggregateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"selection\": [\n            \"startDate\",\n            \"endDate\"\n          ],\n          \"binaryOperator\": {\n            \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.doc.dev.aggregator.ExampleTuple2BinaryOperator\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nTypes\nAll types used in the elements schema must be defined in the types parts of the schema. These Types explain to Gaffer what types of properties to expect and how to deal with them.\nFor each type you must provide the following information:\n\nclass - this is the Java class of the type\n\nYou can optionally provide the following:\n\ndescription - a string containing a description of the type\nvalidateFunctions - an array of predicates that will be executed against every type value to validate it. To improve performance put quicker/low cost functions first in the array.\naggregateFunction - the aggregate binary operator to use to aggregate/summarise/merge property values of the same type together.\nserialiser - an object that contains a field class which represents the java class of the serialiser to use, and potentially arguments depending on the serialiser. If this is not provided Gaffer will attempt to select an appropriate one for you - this is only available for simple Java types.\n\nHere are some example Types\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"junction\": {\n      \"description\": \"A road junction represented by a String.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\"\n    },\n    \"road\": {\n      \"description\": \"A road represented by a String.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\"\n    },\n    \"anyVertex\": {\n      \"description\": \"An String vertex - used for cardinalities\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\"\n    },\n    \"count.long\": {\n      \"description\": \"A long count that must be greater than or equal to 0.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Long\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsMoreThan\",\n          \"orEqualTo\": true,\n          \"value\": {\n            \"java.lang.Long\": 0\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Sum\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"true\": {\n      \"description\": \"A simple boolean that must always be true.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsTrue\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"date.earliest\": {\n      \"description\": \"A Date that when aggregated together will be the earliest date.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.util.Date\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Min\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"date.latest\": {\n      \"description\": \"A Date that when aggregated together will be the latest date.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.util.Date\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Max\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"set\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.util.TreeSet\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.CollectionConcat\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"hllp\": {\n      \"class\": \"com.clearspring.analytics.stream.cardinality.HyperLogLogPlus\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.binaryoperator.HyperLogLogPlusAggregator\"\n      },\n      \"serialiser\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.serialisation.HyperLogLogPlusSerialiser\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nFull Schema\nOnce the schema has been loaded into a graph the parent elements are merged into the children for performance reasons.

As well as simple properties, such as a String or Integer, Gaffer allows rich properties such as sketches and sets of timestamps to be stored on Elements. Gaffer's ability to continuously aggregate properties on elements allows interesting, dynamic data structures to be stored within the graph. Examples include storing a HyperLogLog sketch on an Entity to give a very quick estimate of the degree of a node or storing a uniform random sample of the timestamps that an edge was seen active.\nGaffer allows any Java object to be used as a property. If the property is not natively supported by Gaffer, then you will need to provide a serialiser, and possibly an aggregator.\nThe properties that Gaffer natively supports can be divided into three categories:\n\nStandard simple Java properties.\nSketches from the clearspring and datasketches libraries.\nSets of timestamps.\n\nThis documentation gives some examples of how to use all of the above types of property.\nRunning the Examples\nThe example can be run in a similar way to the user and developer examples. \nYou can download the doc-jar-with-dependencies.jar from maven central. Select the latest version and download the jar-with-dependencies.jar file.\nAlternatively you can compile the code yourself by running a \"mvn clean install -Pquick\". The doc-jar-with-dependencies.jar file will be located here: doc/target/doc-jar-with-dependencies.jar.\n```bash\nReplace  with your example name.\njava -cp doc-jar-with-dependencies.jar uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.doc.properties.walkthrough.DoublesSketchWalkthrough\n```\nSimple properties\nGaffer supports the storage of some common Java objects as properties on entities and edges. These include Integer, Long, Double, Float, Boolean, Date, String, byte[] and TreeSet. Serialisers for these will automatically be added to your schema when you create a graph using a schema that uses these properties. Aggregators for these properties are provided by the Koryphe library and include all the standard functions such as minimum, maximum, sum, etc.\nGaffer also provides a FreqMap property. This is a map from string to long.\nThe Getting started documentation includes examples of how to use these properties.\nSketches\nA sketch is a compact data structure that gives an approximate answer to a question. For example, a HyperLogLog sketch can estimate the cardinality of a set with billions of elements with a small relative error, using orders of magnitude less storage than storing the full set.\nGaffer allows sketches to be stored on Entities and Edges. These sketches can be continually updated as new data arrives. Here are some example applications of sketches in Gaffer:\n\nUsing a HyperLogLogPlusPlus sketch to provide a very quick estimate of the degree of a node.\nUsing a quantiles sketch to estimate the median score associated to an edge, or the 99th percentile of the scores seen on an edge.\nUsing a reservoir items sketch to store a sample of all the distinct labels associated to an edge.\nUsing theta sketches to estimate the number of distinct edges seen on a particular day, the number seen on the previous day and the overlap between the two days.\n\nGaffer provides serialisers and aggregators for sketches from two different libraries: the Clearspring library and the Datasketches library.\nFor the Clearspring library, a serialiser and an aggregator is provided for the HyperLogLogPlus sketch. This is an implementation of the HyperLogLog++ algorithm described in this paper.\nFor the Datasketches library, serialisers and aggregators are provided for several sketches. These sketches include:\n\nHyperLogLog sketches for estimating the cardinality of a set (see class com.yahoo.sketches.hll.HllSketch);\nFrequency sketches for estimating the frequencies of items such as longs and strings respectively (see for example class com.yahoo.sketches.frequencies.LongsSketch);\nQuantile sketches for estimating the quantiles of doubles or strings seen on an element (see for example class com.yahoo.sketches.quantiles.DoublesSketch);\nSampling sketches for maintaining samples of items seen on an element (see for example class com.yahoo.sketches.sampling.ReservoirItemsSketch);\nTheta sketches for estimating the union and intersection of sets (see for example class com.yahoo.sketches.theta.Sketch).\n\nMost of the Datasketches sketches come in two forms: a standard sketch form and a \"union\" form. The latter is technically not a sketch. It is an operator that allows efficient union operations of two sketches. It also allows updating the sketch with individual items. In order to obtain estimates from it, it is necessary to first obtain a sketch from it, using a method called getResult(). There are some interesting trade-offs in the serialisation and aggregation speeds between the sketches and the unions. If in doubt, use the standard sketches. Examples are provided for the standard sketches, but not for the unions.\nTimestamps\nGaffer contains a time-library containing some simple properties which allow sets of timestamps to be stored on entities and edges. There are two properties:\n\nRBMBackedTimestampSet: When this is created, a TimeBucket is specified, e.g. minute. When a timestamp is added, it is truncated to the nearest start of a bucket (e.g. if the bucket is a minute then the seconds are removed) and then added to the set. Internally the timestamps are stored in a Roaring Bitmap.\nBoundedTimestampSet: This is similar to the above set, except that when it is created a maximum size is specified. If the set grows beyond the maximum size, then a random sample of the timestamps of that size is created. This is useful to avoid the size of the set for entities or edges that are very busy growing too large. By retaining a sample, we maintain an indication of when the entity or edge was active, without retaining all the information. The sample is implemented using a ReservoirLongsUnion from the Datasketches library.\n\nWalkthroughs\nThis section contains examples that show how to use some of the properties described above.\nHyperLogLogPlus\nThe code for this example is HyperLogLogPlusWalkthrough.\nThis example demonstrates how the HyperLogLogPlus sketch from the Clearspring library can be used to maintain an estimate of the degree of a vertex. Every time an edge A -> B is added to graph, we also add an Entity for A with a property of a HyperLogLogPlus containing B, and an Entity for B with a property of a HyperLogLogPlus containing A. The aggregator for the HyperLogLogPluses merges them together so that after querying for the Entity for vertex X the HyperLogLogPlus property gives us an estimate of the approximate degree.\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema. The edge has a property called 'approx_cardinality'. This will store the HyperLogLogPlus object.\njson\n{\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"cardinality\": {\n      \"vertex\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"approxCardinality\": \"hyperloglogplus\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nTypes schema\nWe have added a new type - 'hyperloglogplus'. This is a com.clearspring.analytics.stream.cardinality.HyperLogLogPlus object.\nWe also added in the serialiser and aggregator for the HyperLogLogPlus object. Gaffer will automatically aggregate these sketches, using the provided aggregator, so they will keep up to date as new entities are added to the graph.\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"vertex.string\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"hyperloglogplus\": {\n      \"class\": \"com.clearspring.analytics.stream.cardinality.HyperLogLogPlus\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.clearspring.cardinality.binaryoperator.HyperLogLogPlusAggregator\"\n      },\n      \"serialiser\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.clearspring.cardinality.serialisation.HyperLogLogPlusSerialiser\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nOnly one entity is in the graph. This was added 1000 times, and each time it had the 'approxCardinality' property containing a vertex that A had been seen in an Edge with. Here is the Entity:\n```\nEntity[vertex=A,group=cardinality,properties=Properties[approxCardinality=com.clearspring.analytics.stream.cardinality.HyperLogLogPlus@756cf158]]\n```\nThis is not very illuminating as this just shows the default toString() method on the sketch.\nWe can fetch the cardinality for the vertex using the following code:\njava\nfinal GetElements query = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .input(new EntitySeed(\"A\"))\n        .build();\nfinal Element element;\ntry (final CloseableIterable<? extends Element> elements = graph.execute(query, user)) {\n    element = elements.iterator().next();\n}\nfinal HyperLogLogPlus hyperLogLogPlus = (HyperLogLogPlus) element.getProperty(\"approxCardinality\");\nfinal double approxDegree = hyperLogLogPlus.cardinality();\nfinal String degreeEstimate = \"Entity A has approximate degree \" + approxDegree;\nThe results are as follows. As an Entity was added 1000 times, each time with a different vertex, then we would expect the degree to be approximately 1000.\n```\nEntity A has approximate degree 1113.0\n```\nHllSketch\nThe code for this example is HllSketchWalkthrough.\nThis example demonstrates how the HllSketch sketch from the Data Sketches library can be used to maintain an estimate of the degree of a vertex. Every time an edge A -> B is added to graph, we also add an Entity for A with a property of a HllSketch containing B, and an Entity for B with a property of a HllSketch containing A. The aggregator for the HllSketches merges them together so that after querying for the Entity for vertex X the HllSketch property would give us an estimate of the approximate degree.\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema. The edge has a property called 'approx_cardinality'. This will store the HllSketch object.\njson\n{\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"cardinality\": {\n      \"vertex\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"approxCardinality\": \"hllsketch\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nTypes schema\nWe have added a new type - 'hllsketch'. This is a com.yahoo.sketches.hll.HllSketch object.\nWe also added in the serialiser and aggregator for the HllSketch object. Gaffer will automatically aggregate these sketches, using the provided aggregator, so they will keep up to date as new entities are added to the graph.\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"vertex.string\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"hllsketch\": {\n      \"class\": \"com.yahoo.sketches.hll.HllSketch\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.cardinality.binaryoperator.HllSketchAggregator\"\n      },\n      \"serialiser\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.cardinality.serialisation.HllSketchSerialiser\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nOnly one entity is in the graph. This was added 1000 times, and each time it had the 'approxCardinality' property containing a vertex that A had been seen in an Edge with. Here is the Entity:\n```\nEntity[vertex=A,group=cardinality,properties=Properties[approxCardinality=### HLL SKETCH SUMMARY: \n  Log Config K   : 10\n  Hll Target     : HLL_8\n  Current Mode   : HLL\n  LB             : 986.7698164613868\n  Estimate       : 1018.8398354963819\n  UB             : 1053.0644294536246\n  OutOfOrder Flag: true\n  CurMin         : 0\n  NumAtCurMin    : 374\n  HipAccum       : 1007.7235730289277\n]]\n```\nThis is not very illuminating as this just shows the default toString() method on the sketch.\nWe can fetch the cardinality for the vertex using the following code:\njava\nfinal GetElements query = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .input(new EntitySeed(\"A\"))\n        .build();\nfinal Element element;\ntry (final CloseableIterable<? extends Element> elements = graph.execute(query, user)) {\n    element = elements.iterator().next();\n}\nfinal HllSketch hllSketch = (HllSketch) element.getProperty(\"approxCardinality\");\nfinal double approxDegree = hllSketch.getEstimate();\nfinal String degreeEstimate = \"Entity A has approximate degree \" + approxDegree;\nThe results are as follows. As an Entity was added 1000 times, each time with a different vertex, then we would expect the degree to be approximately 1000.\n```\nEntity A has approximate degree 1018.8398354963819\n```\nLongsSketch\nThe code for this example is LongsSketchWalkthrough.\nThis example demonstrates how the LongsSketch sketch from the Data Sketches library can be used to maintain estimates of the frequencies of longs stored on on vertices and edges. For example suppose every time an edge is observed there is a long value associated with it which specifies the size of the interaction. Storing all the different longs on the edge could be expensive in storage. Instead we can use a LongsSketch which will give us approximate counts of the number of times a particular long was observed.\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema. The edge has a property called 'longsSketch'. This will store the LongsSketch object.\njson\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"red\": {\n      \"source\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"destination\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"directed\": \"false\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"longsSketch\": \"longs.sketch\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nTypes schema\nWe have added a new type - 'longs.sketch'. This is a com.yahoo.sketches.frequencies.LongsSketch object.\nWe also added in the serialiser and aggregator for the LongsSketch object. Gaffer will automatically aggregate these sketches, using the provided aggregator, so they will keep up to date as new edges are added to the graph.\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"vertex.string\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"longs.sketch\": {\n      \"class\": \"com.yahoo.sketches.frequencies.LongsSketch\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.frequencies.binaryoperator.LongsSketchAggregator\"\n      },\n      \"serialiser\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.frequencies.serialisation.LongsSketchSerialiser\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"false\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsFalse\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nOnly one edge is in the graph. This was added 1000 times, and each time it had the 'longs.sketch' property containing a randomly generated long between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The sketch does not retain all the distinct occurrences of these long values, but allows one to estimate the number of occurrences of the different values. Here is the Edge:\n```\nEdge[source=A,destination=B,directed=false,group=red,properties=Properties[longsSketch=FrequentLongsSketch:\n  Stream Length    : 1000\n  Max Error Offset : 0\nReversePurgeLongHashMap:\n         Index:     States              Values Keys\n             0:          1                 112 0\n             3:          1                  96 6\n             5:          1                  92 4\n             6:          2                 103 5\n             7:          3                  98 9\n             8:          2                  91 2\n             9:          3                  98 8\n            12:          1                 106 1\n            13:          1                  99 7\n            14:          1                 105 3\n]]\n```\nThis is not very illuminating as this just shows the default toString() method on the sketch. To get value from it we need to call methods on the LongsSketch object. Let's get estimates of the frequencies of the values 1 and 9.\nWe can fetch all cardinalities for all the vertices using the following code:\njava\nfinal GetElements query = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .input(new EdgeSeed(\"A\", \"B\", DirectedType.UNDIRECTED))\n        .build();\nfinal Element edge;\ntry (final CloseableIterable<? extends Element> edges = graph.execute(query, user)) {\n    edge = edges.iterator().next();\n}\nfinal LongsSketch longsSketch = (LongsSketch) edge.getProperty(\"longsSketch\");\nfinal String estimates = \"Edge A-B: 1L seen approximately \" + longsSketch.getEstimate(1L)\n        + \" times, 9L seen approximately \" + longsSketch.getEstimate(9L) + \" times.\";\nThe results are as follows. As 1000 edges were generated with a long randomly sampled from 0 to 9 then the occurrence of each is approximately 100.\n```\nEdge A-B: 1L seen approximately 106 times, 9L seen approximately 98 times.\n```\nDoublesSketch\nThe code for this example is DoublesSketchWalkthrough.\nThis example demonstrates how the DoublesSketch sketch from the Data Sketches library can be used to maintain estimates of the quantiles of a distribution of doubles. Suppose that every time an edge is observed, there is a double value associated with it, for example a value between 0 and 1 giving the score of the edge. Instead of storing a property that contains all the doubles observed, we can store a DoublesSketch which will allow us to estimate the median double, the 99th percentile, etc.\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema. The edge has a property called 'doublesSketch'. This will store the DoublesSketch object.\njson\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"red\": {\n      \"source\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"destination\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"directed\": \"false\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"doublesSketch\": \"doubles.sketch\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nTypes schema\nWe have added a new type - 'doubles.sketch'. This is a com.yahoo.sketches.quantiles.DoublesSketch object.\nWe also added in the serialiser and aggregator for the DoublesSketch object.

To get value from it we need to call methods on the DoublesSketch object. We can get an estimate for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles on edge A-B using the following code:\njava\nfinal GetElements query = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .input(new EdgeSeed(\"A\", \"B\", DirectedType.UNDIRECTED))\n        .build();\nfinal Element edge;\ntry (final CloseableIterable<? extends Element> edges = graph.execute(query, user)) {\n    edge = edges.iterator().next();\n}\nfinal DoublesSketch doublesSketch = (DoublesSketch) edge.getProperty(\"doublesSketch\");\nfinal double[] quantiles = doublesSketch.getQuantiles(new double[]{0.25D, 0.5D, 0.75D});\nfinal String quantilesEstimate = \"Edge A-B with percentiles of double property - 25th percentile: \" + quantiles[0]\n        + \", 50th percentile: \" + quantiles[1]\n        + \", 75th percentile: \" + quantiles[2];\nThe results are as follows. This means that 25% of all the doubles on edge A-B had value less than -0.66, 50% had value less than -0.01 and 75% had value less than 0.64 (the results of the estimation are not deterministic so there may be small differences between the values below and those just quoted).\n```\nEdge A-B with percentiles of double property - 25th percentile: -0.6630847714290219, 50th percentile: -0.009776218111167738, 75th percentile: 0.6311663168517678\n```\nWe can also get the cumulative density predicate of the distribution of the doubles:\njava\nfinal GetElements query2 = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .input(new EdgeSeed(\"A\", \"B\", DirectedType.UNDIRECTED))\n        .build();\nfinal Element edge2;\ntry (final CloseableIterable<? extends Element> edges2 = graph.execute(query2, user)) {\n    edge2 = edges2.iterator().next();\n}\nfinal DoublesSketch doublesSketch2 = (DoublesSketch) edge2.getProperty(\"doublesSketch\");\nfinal double[] cdf = doublesSketch2.getCDF(new double[]{0.0D, 1.0D, 2.0D});\nfinal String cdfEstimate = \"Edge A-B with CDF values at 0: \" + cdf[0]\n        + \", at 1: \" + cdf[1]\n        + \", at 2: \" + cdf[2];\nThe results are:\n```\nEdge A-B with CDF values at 0: 0.507, at 1: 0.843, at 2: 0.983\n```\nReservoirItemsSketch\nThe code for this example is ReservoirItemsSketchWalkthrough.\nThis example demonstrates how the ReservoirItemsSketch sketch from the Data Sketches library can be used to maintain estimates of properties on vertices and edges. The ReservoirItemsSketch sketch allows a sample of a set of strings to be maintained. We give two examples of this. The first is if when an edge is observed there is a string property associated to it, and there are a lot of different values of that string. We may not want to store all the different values of the string, but we may want to see a random sample of them. The second example is to store on an Entity a sketch which gives a sample of the vertices that are connected to the vertex. Even if we are storing all the edges then producing a random sample of the vertices attached to a vertex may not be quick (for example if a vertex has degree 10,000 then producing a sample of a random 10 neighbours would require scanning all the edges - storing the sketch on the Entity means that the sample will be precomputed and can be returned without scanning the edges).\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema. The edge has a property called 'stringsSample'. This will store the ReservoirItemsSketch object. The entity has a property called 'neighboursSample'. This will also store a ReservoirItemsSketch object.\njson\n{\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"blueEntity\": {\n      \"vertex\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"neighboursSample\": \"reservoir.strings.sketch\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"red\": {\n      \"source\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"destination\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"directed\": \"false\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"stringsSample\": \"reservoir.strings.sketch\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"blue\": {\n      \"source\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"destination\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"directed\": \"false\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nTypes schema\nWe have added a new type - 'reservoir.strings.sketch'. This is a com.yahoo.sketches.sampling.ReservoirItemsSketch object.\nWe also added in the serialiser and aggregator for the ReservoirItemsSketch object.

Here is the edge:\n```\nEdge[source=A,destination=B,directed=false,group=red,properties=Properties[stringsSample=\nReservoirItemsSketch SUMMARY:\nk            : 20\n   n            : 1000\n   Current size : 20\n   Resize factor: X8\nEND SKETCH SUMMARY\n]]\n```\nThis is not very illuminating as this just shows the default toString() method on the sketch.

For each of these edges, an Entity was created for both the source and destination. Each Entity contained a 'neighboursSample' property that contains the vertex at the other end of the edge. We now get the Entity for the vertex X and display the sample of its neighbours:\njava\nfinal GetElements query2 = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .input(new EntitySeed(\"X\"))\n        .build();\nfinal Element entity;\ntry (final CloseableIterable<? extends Element> entities = graph.execute(query2, user)) {\n    entity = entities.iterator().next();\n}\nfinal ReservoirItemsSketch<String> neighboursSketch = ((ReservoirItemsSketch<String>) entity.getProperty(\"neighboursSample\"));\nfinal String[] neighboursSample = neighboursSketch.getSamples();\nsb.setLength(0);\nsb.append(\"10 samples: \");\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10 && i < neighboursSample.length; i++) {\n    if (i > 0) {\n        sb.append(\", \");\n    }\n    sb.append(neighboursSample[i]);\n}\nThe results are:\n```\n10 samples: Y499, Y351, Y430, Y472, Y58, Y467, Y166, Y144, Y389, Y9\n```\nThetaSketch\nThe code for this example is ThetaSketchWalkthrough.\nThis example demonstrates how the com.yahoo.sketches.theta.Sketch sketch from the Data Sketches library can be used to maintain estimates of the cardinalities of sets. This sketch is similar to a HyperLogLogPlusPlus, but it can also be used to estimate the size of the intersections of sets. We give an example of how this can be used to monitor the changes to the number of edges in the graph over time.\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema. The edge has properties called 'startDate' and 'endDate'. These will be set to the midnight before the time of the occurrence of the edge and to midnight after the time of the occurrence of the edge. There is also a size property which will be a theta Sketch. This property will be aggregated over the 'groupBy' properties of startDate and endDate.\njson\n{\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"size\": {\n      \"vertex\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"startDate\": \"date.earliest\",\n        \"endDate\": \"date.latest\",\n        \"size\": \"thetasketch\"\n      },\n      \"groupBy\": [\n        \"startDate\",\n        \"endDate\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"red\": {\n      \"source\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"destination\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"directed\": \"false\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"startDate\": \"date.earliest\",\n        \"endDate\": \"date.latest\",\n        \"count\": \"long.count\"\n      },\n      \"groupBy\": [\n        \"startDate\",\n        \"endDate\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nTypes schema\nWe have added a new type - 'thetasketch'.

This was added 25 times, and each time it had the 'timestampSet' property containing a randomly generated timestamp from 2017. Here is the Edge:\n```\nEdge[source=A,destination=B,directed=false,group=red,properties=Properties[timestampSet=RBMBackedTimestampSet[timeBucket=MINUTE,timestamps=2017-01-08T07:29:00Z,2017-01-18T10:41:00Z,2017-01-19T01:36:00Z,2017-01-31T16:16:00Z,2017-02-02T08:06:00Z,2017-02-12T14:21:00Z,2017-02-15T22:01:00Z,2017-03-06T09:03:00Z,2017-03-21T18:09:00Z,2017-05-08T15:34:00Z,2017-05-10T19:39:00Z,2017-05-16T10:44:00Z,2017-05-23T10:02:00Z,2017-05-28T01:52:00Z,2017-06-24T23:50:00Z,2017-07-27T09:34:00Z,2017-08-05T02:11:00Z,2017-09-07T07:35:00Z,2017-10-01T12:52:00Z,2017-10-23T22:02:00Z,2017-10-27T04:12:00Z,2017-11-01T02:45:00Z,2017-12-11T16:38:00Z,2017-12-22T14:40:00Z,2017-12-24T08:00:00Z]]]\n```\nYou can see the list of timestamps on the edge. We can also get just the earliest, latest and total number of timestamps using methods on the TimestampSet object to get the following results:\n```\nEdge A-B was first seen at 2017-01-08T07:29:00Z, last seen at 2017-12-24T08:00:00Z, and there were 25 timestamps it was active.\n```\nBoundedTimestampSet\nThe code for this example is BoundedTimestampSetWalkthrough.\nThis example demonstrates how the BoundedTimestampSet property can be used to maintain a set of the timestamps at which an element was seen active. If this set becomes larger than a size specified by the user then a uniform random sample of the timestamps is maintained. In this example we record the timestamps to minute level accuracy, i.e. the seconds are ignored, and specify that at most 25 timestamps should be retained.\nElements schema\nThis is our new schema. The edge has a property called 'boundedTimestampSet'. This will store the BoundedTimestampSet object, which is actually a 'BoundedTimestampSet'.\njson\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"red\": {\n      \"source\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"destination\": \"vertex.string\",\n      \"directed\": \"false\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"boundedTimestampSet\": \"bounded.timestamp.set\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nTypes schema\nWe have added a new type - 'bounded.timestamp.set'. This is a uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.time.BoundedTimestampSet object. We have added in the serialiser and aggregator for the BoundedTimestampSet object. Gaffer will automatically aggregate these sets together to maintain a set of all the times the element was active. Once the size of the set becomes larger than 25 then a uniform random sample of size at most 25 of the timestamps is maintained.\njson\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"vertex.string\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.String\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"bounded.timestamp.set\": {\n      \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.time.BoundedTimestampSet\",\n      \"aggregateFunction\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.time.binaryoperator.BoundedTimestampSetAggregator\"\n      },\n      \"serialiser\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.time.serialisation.BoundedTimestampSetSerialiser\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"false\": {\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsFalse\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nThere are two edges in the graph. Edge A-B was added 3 times, and each time it had the 'boundedTimestampSet' property containing a randomly generated timestamp from 2017. Edge A-C was added 1000 times, and each time it also had the 'boundedTimestampSet' property containing a randomly generated timestamp from 2017. Here are the edges:\n```\nEdge[source=A,destination=B,directed=false,group=red,properties=Properties[boundedTimestampSet=BoundedTimestampSet[timeBucket=MINUTE,state=NOT_FULL,maxSize=25,timestamps=2017-02-12T14:21:00Z,2017-03-21T18:09:00Z,2017-12-24T08:00:00Z]]]\nEdge[source=A,destination=C,directed=false,group=red,properties=Properties[boundedTimestampSet=BoundedTimestampSet[timeBucket=MINUTE,state=SAMPLE,maxSize=25,timestamps=2017-01-01T23:00:00Z,2017-01-15T04:54:00Z,2017-01-19T14:48:00Z,2017-01-20T22:54:00Z,2017-02-03T14:58:00Z,2017-02-18T13:02:00Z,2017-02-28T11:57:00Z,2017-03-23T08:49:00Z,2017-03-28T19:44:00Z,2017-04-21T22:01:00Z,2017-04-24T19:45:00Z,2017-04-26T22:03:00Z,2017-07-20T12:47:00Z,2017-07-29T17:40:00Z,2017-08-12T04:03:00Z,2017-09-09T04:08:00Z,2017-09-27T07:08:00Z,2017-10-16T17:31:00Z,2017-10-29T22:33:00Z,2017-10-30T02:15:00Z,2017-11-20T00:54:00Z,2017-11-20T17:11:00Z,2017-11-25T13:04:00Z,2017-12-18T08:07:00Z,2017-12-26T21:40:00Z]]]\n```\nYou

Merged into develop.. I'm going to close this for now until we have fixed the authorisations and named operations issues.. See #287 for an example of the operation.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. This is related to #1063.. The changes have been completed, but it depends on pull request https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/1092 to be merged in first.. # Migration Steps\nNamed operations are now part of core Gaffer and as long as you have configured a cache service for Gaffer named operations will be available.\n\nThis means you should remove the following from your store properties file:\nproperties\ngaffer.store.operation.declarations=NamedOperationDeclarations.json\nRemove this dependency:\nxml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.gaffer</groupId>\n    <artifactId>named-operation-library</artifactId>        \n    <version>${gaffer.version}</version>        \n</dependency>\nNamed operations are now resolved via a GraphHook. If you do not manually add the NamedOperationResolver graph hook then it will be automatically added as the first graph hook. So if you want to run other graph hooks before the named operations are resolved (such as OperationChainLimiter) then you must manually add the NamedOperationResolver as a graph hook in the required position.. Merged into develop-1.0.0.. The updated Limit Example:\nLimit example\nSee javadoc - uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.Limit.\nRequired fields\nThe following fields are required: \n- resultLimit\nLimit elements to 3\nUsing this simple directed graph:\n```\n--> 4 <--\n\n/     ^     \\\n /      |      \\\n1  -->  2  -->  3\n         \\\n           -->  5\n```\nAs Java:\njava\nfinal OperationChain<Iterable<? extends Element>> opChain = new OperationChain.Builder()\n        .first(new GetAllElements())\n        .then(new Limit<>(3))\n        .build();\nAs JSON:\njson\n{\n  \"operations\" : [ {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\"\n  }, {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.Limit\",\n    \"resultLimit\" : 3,\n    \"truncate\" : true\n  } ]\n}\nResult:\nEntity[vertex=1,group=entity,properties=Properties[count=<java.lang.Integer>3]]\nEdge[source=1,destination=2,directed=true,group=edge,properties=Properties[count=<java.lang.Integer>3]]\nEdge[source=1,destination=4,directed=true,group=edge,properties=Properties[count=<java.lang.Integer>1]]\n\nLimit elements to 3 without truncation\nSetting this flag to false will throw an error instead of truncating the iterable. In this case there are more than 3 elements, so when executed a LimitExceededException would be thrown.\nAs Java:\njava\nfinal OperationChain<Iterable<? extends Element>> opChain = new OperationChain.Builder()\n        .first(new GetAllElements())\n        .then(new Limit<>(3, false))\n        .build();\nAs JSON:\njson\n{\n  \"operations\" : [ {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\"\n  }, {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.Limit\",\n    \"resultLimit\" : 3,\n    \"truncate\" : false\n  } ]\n}\n\nLimit elements to 3 with builder\nA builder can also be used to create the limit - note that truncate is set to true by default, so in this case it is redundant, but simply shown for demonstration.\nUsing this simple directed graph:\n```\n--> 4 <--\n\n/     ^     \\\n /      |      \\\n1  -->  2  -->  3\n         \\\n           -->  5\n```\nAs Java:\njava\nfinal OperationChain<Iterable<? extends Element>> opChain = new OperationChain.Builder()\n        .first(new GetAllElements())\n        .then(new Limit.Builder<Element>()\n                .resultLimit(3)\n                .truncate(true)\n                .build())\n        .build();\nAs JSON:\njson\n{\n  \"operations\" : [ {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\"\n  }, {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.Limit\",\n    \"resultLimit\" : 3,\n    \"truncate\" : true\n  } ]\n}\nResult:\nEntity[vertex=1,group=entity,properties=Properties[count=<java.lang.Integer>3]]\nEdge[source=1,destination=2,directed=true,group=edge,properties=Properties[count=<java.lang.Integer>3]]\nEdge[source=1,destination=4,directed=true,group=edge,properties=Properties[count=<java.lang.Integer>1]]\n\n. Merged into develop.. This will be an improvement to #287. It could involve just creating a separate operation or adding the functionality into the existing ExportToOtherGraph operation.. Operation example documentation for the Wiki:\nExportToOtherAuthorisedGraph example\nSee javadoc - uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.export.graph.ExportToOtherAuthorisedGraph.\nThese export examples export all edges in the example graph to another Gaffer instance using Operation Auths against the user. \nTo add this operation to your Gaffer graph you will need to write your own version of ExportToOtherAuthorisedGraphOperationDeclarations.json containing the user auths, and then set this property: gaffer.store.operation.declarations=/path/to/ExportToOtherAuthorisedGraphOperationDeclarations.json\nRequired fields\nThe following fields are required: \n- graphId\nSimple export\nThis example will export all Edges with group 'edge' to another Gaffer graph with ID 'graph2'. The graph will be loaded from the configured GraphLibrary, so it must already exist. In order to export to graph2 the user must have the required user authorisations that were configured for this operation.\nAs Java:\njava\nfinal OperationChain<Iterable<? extends Element>> opChain =\n        new OperationChain.Builder()\n                .first(new GetAllElements.Builder()\n                        .view(new View.Builder()\n                                .edge(\"edge\")\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .then(new ExportToOtherAuthorisedGraph.Builder()\n                        .graphId(\"graph2\")\n                        .build())\n                .build();\nAs JSON:\njson\n{\n  \"operations\" : [ {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\",\n    \"view\" : {\n      \"edges\" : {\n        \"edge\" : { }\n      },\n      \"entities\" : { }\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.export.graph.ExportToOtherAuthorisedGraph\",\n    \"graphId\" : \"graph2\"\n  } ]\n}\n\nSimple export using parent ids\nThis example will export all Edges with group 'edge' to another Gaffer graph with new ID 'newGraphId'. The new graph will have a parent Schema and Store Properties within the graph library specifed by the ID's schemaId1 and storePropsId1. In order to export to newGraphId with storePropsId1 and schemaId1 the user must have the required user authorisations that were configured for this operation to use each of these 3 ids.\nAs Java:\njava\nfinal OperationChain<Iterable<? extends Element>> opChain =\n        new OperationChain.Builder()\n                .first(new GetAllElements.Builder()\n                        .view(new View.Builder()\n                                .edge(\"edge\")\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .then(new ExportToOtherAuthorisedGraph.Builder()\n                        .graphId(\"newGraphId\")\n                        .parentStorePropertiesId(\"storePropsId1\")\n                        .parentSchemaIds(\"schemaId1\")\n                        .build())\n                .build();\nAs JSON:\njson\n{\n  \"operations\" : [ {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\",\n    \"view\" : {\n      \"edges\" : {\n        \"edge\" : { }\n      },\n      \"entities\" : { }\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.export.graph.ExportToOtherAuthorisedGraph\",\n    \"graphId\" : \"newGraphId\",\n    \"parentSchemaIds\" : [ \"schemaId1\" ],\n    \"parentStorePropertiesId\" : \"storePropsId1\"\n  } ]\n}\n-----------------------------------------------. Merged into develop.. Closing whilst I make a few changes.. # Migration Steps\nGraph hooks are now configured in json. This simplifies the configuration required to add graph hooks to a Gaffer rest api. You can now provide one json files containing the configuration for all of your graph hooks. For example:\njson\n[\n  {\n    \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.graph.hook.OperationChainLimiter\",\n    \"opScores\": {\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.Operation\": 1,\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.add.AddElements\": 2,\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElement\": 5,\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.generate.GenerateObjects\": 0\n    },\n    \"authScores\": {\n        \"User\": 2,\n        \"SuperUser\": 5\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.graph.hook.AddOperationsToChain\",\n    \"end\": [\n      {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.Count\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"after\": {\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.Limit\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.graph.hook.OperationAuthoriser\",\n    \"auths\": {\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.Operation\": [\n        \"User\"\n      ],\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.io.Output\": [\n        \"ReadUser\"\n      ],\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.add.AddElements\": [\n        \"WriteUser\"\n      ],\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAdjacentIds\": [\n        \"SuperUser\"\n      ],\n      \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\": [\n        \"AdminUser\",\n        \"SuperUser\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\nMigration notes for individual Graph Hooks\nOperationAuthoriser\nInstead of supplying the opAuths.properties file, you now need to configure the hook in json using the auths field. auths is a map of operation class name to array of string authorisations. See above for a json example.\nOperationChainLimiter (and ScoreOperationChainHandler)\nRather than providing the authScores.properties and opScores.properties files you now need to configure the hook in json using the authScores and opScores fields. See above for a json example.\n\nauthScores is a map of auth string to integer score.\nopScores is a map of operation class name to integer score.\n\nThe ScoreOperationChainHandler score property files have also been removed and replaced with a single json file similar to OperationChainLimiter. The only difference with the json file is that it does not have a class name field.\nFor example:\nScoreOperationChainDeclaration.json:\n```json\n{\n  \"operations\": [\n    {\n      \"operation\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.ScoreOperationChain\",\n      \"handler\": {\n        \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.store.operation.handler.ScoreOperationChainHandler\",\n        \"opScores\": {\n          \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.Operation\": 1,\n          \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.generate.GenerateObjects\": 0\n        },\n        \"authScores\": {\n          \"TEST_USER\": 4,\n          \"TEST_USER_ENHANCED\": 10\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nREST API changes\nThe system properties have been removed:\n- gaffer.operation.auths.path\n- gaffer.graph.hook.add.operations.path\n- gaffer.chain.limiter.enable\n- gaffer.chain.limiter.operation.scores.path\n- gaffer.chain.limiter.authorisation.scores.path\nThey have been replaced with a single property:\n- gaffer.graph.hooks.path\nthis should be set to a path to your json file containing an array of graph hooks as shown above.. Merged into develop-0.8.0. Merged into develop.. # Migration Steps\nJSONSerialiser is now a singleton and the methods on JSONSerialiser are now static. You will need to remove any instances you have of JSONSerialiser and instead just use the static methods on JSONSerialiser.\nThe behaviour of the JSONSerialiser ObjectMapper can be configured by extending the JSONSerialiser class and configuring the ObjectMapper. Child classes must has a default no argument constructor. You will then need to set the gaffer.serialiser.json.class property in your StoreProperties or as a System Property. You can also add modules to the ObjectMapper by writing an implementation of JSONSerialiserModules and registering it using the gaffer.serialiser.json.modules property in your StoreProperties or as a System Property.\nIf you use libraries like the Sketches library, then they may come with json serialisers that you can use. You can configure your store to use these serialisers by setting a property like:\nproperties\ngaffer.serialiser.json.modules=uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.bitmap.serialisation.json.SketchesJsonModules\nThis property allows a csv of different modules to be configured.\nPreviously there were other ways of configuring the JSONSerialiser, such as in ExportToGafferResultCacheHandler and ProxyProperties. These have been removed in favour of configuring the JSONSerialiser once for the entire jvm.\n. Merged into develop.. @t616178 thanks for reviewing it. I've made the suggested changes.. Closing while changes are made.. # Migration Steps\nSpark has been updated to 2.2.0.. Merged into develop-1.0.0.. Merged into develop.. Currently the Parquet Store has special implementations for primitive predicates for some of Gaffer/Koryphe's core predicates like IsMoreThan. See ParquetFilterUtils.addPrimitiveFilter. I believe this means the IsMoreThan predicate can be applied more efficiently. AgeOff is just another predicate that is quite simple and #1303 is to add specific logic in ParquetFilterUtils to deal with the AgeOff predicate efficiently in a similar way to IsMoreThan.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. This could causes serious problems for anyone who has an '=' in one of they groups. There is no easy way in Gaffer to migrate Gaffer group names in an existing Accumulo or HBase table. Therefore this would mean users could not update to this version of Gaffer.\nProperty names can easily be changed in Gaffer on Accumulo/HBase, users would just need to rename the property in their schema then run the table update utility.\nCould the parquet store escape these characters? Then we could just log a warning for users?. OK, to standardise this we are going to require all group names and property names to be alpha numeric characters (also including the | symbol).\nImportant if you have a group name that isn't currently alpha numeric (including |) this will break your existing data in Accumulo and HBase. If this is the case for you, please get in touch and we can either delay making this change or provide you with advice on migrating your data.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop..

from the Data Sketches library can be used to maintain estimates of the quantiles of a distribution of doubles. Suppose that every time an edge is observed, there is a double value associated with it, for example a value between 0 and 1 giving the score of the edge. Instead of storing a property that contains all the doubles observed, we can store a DoublesUnion which will allow us to estimate the median double, the 99th percentile, etc.\nProperties class: com.yahoo.sketches.quantiles.DoublesUnion\nPredicates:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.And\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsA\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsEqual\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsIn\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Not\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Or\n\nAggregators:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.quantiles.binaryoperator.DoublesUnionAggregator\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.First\n\nTo Bytes Serialisers:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.quantiles.serialisation.DoublesUnionSerialiser\n\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema.

To get value from it we need to call methods on the DoublesUnion object. We can get an estimate for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles on edge A-B using the following code:\njava\nfinal GetElements query = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .input(new EdgeSeed(\"A\", \"B\", DirectedType.UNDIRECTED))\n        .build();\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> edges = graph.execute(query, user);\nfinal Element edge = edges.iterator().next();\nfinal com.yahoo.sketches.quantiles.DoublesUnion doublesUnion = (com.yahoo.sketches.quantiles.DoublesUnion) edge.getProperty(\"doublesUnion\");\nfinal double[] quantiles = doublesUnion.getResult().getQuantiles(new double[]{0.25D, 0.5D, 0.75D});\nfinal String quantilesEstimate = \"Edge A-B with percentiles of double property - 25th percentile: \" + quantiles[0]\n        + \", 50th percentile: \" + quantiles[1]\n        + \", 75th percentile: \" + quantiles[2];\nThe results are as follows. This means that 25% of all the doubles on edge A-B had value less than -0.66, 50% had value less than -0.01 and 75% had value less than 0.64 (the results of the estimation are not deterministic so there may be small differences between the values below and those just quoted).\n```\nEdge A-B with percentiles of double property - 25th percentile: -0.6630847714290219, 50th percentile: -0.0071624422787210824, 75th percentile: 0.6341803995604817\n```\nWe can also get the cumulative density predicate of the distribution of the doubles:\njava\nfinal GetElements query2 = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .input(new EdgeSeed(\"A\", \"B\", DirectedType.UNDIRECTED))\n        .build();\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> edges2 = graph.execute(query2, user);\nfinal Element edge2 = edges2.iterator().next();\nfinal DoublesSketch doublesSketch2 = ((com.yahoo.sketches.quantiles.DoublesUnion) edge2.getProperty(\"doublesUnion\")).getResult();\nfinal double[] cdf = doublesSketch2.getCDF(new double[]{0.0D, 1.0D, 2.0D});\nfinal String cdfEstimate = \"Edge A-B with CDF values at 0: \" + cdf[0]\n        + \", at 1: \" + cdf[1]\n        + \", at 2: \" + cdf[2];\nThe results are:\n```\nEdge A-B with CDF values at 0: 0.506, at 1: 0.839, at 2: 0.983\n```\nLongsSketch\nThe code for this example is LongsSketch.\nThis example demonstrates how the LongsSketch sketch from the Data Sketches library can be used to maintain estimates of the frequencies of longs stored on on vertices and edges. For example suppose every time an edge is observed there is a long value associated with it which specifies the size of the interaction. Storing all the different longs on the edge could be expensive in storage. Instead we can use a LongsSketch which will give us approximate counts of the number of times a particular long was observed.\nProperties class: com.yahoo.sketches.frequencies.LongsSketch\nPredicates:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.And\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsA\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsEqual\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsIn\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Not\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Or\n\nAggregators:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.frequencies.binaryoperator.LongsSketchAggregator\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.First\n\nTo Bytes Serialisers:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.frequencies.serialisation.LongsSketchSerialiser\n\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema.

This was added 1000 times, and each time it had the 'longs.sketch' property containing a randomly generated long between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The sketch does not retain all the distinct occurrences of these long values, but allows one to estimate the number of occurrences of the different values. Here is the Edge:\n```\nEdge[source=A,destination=B,directed=false,group=red,properties=Properties[longsSketch=FrequentLongsSketch:\n  Stream Length    : 1000\n  Max Error Offset : 0\nReversePurgeLongHashMap:\n         Index:     States              Values Keys\n             0:          1                 112 0\n             3:          1                  96 6\n             5:          1                  98 9\n             6:          2                  92 4\n             7:          3                 103 5\n             8:          2                  91 2\n             9:          3                  98 8\n            12:          1                 106 1\n            13:          1                  99 7\n            14:          1                 105 3\n]]\n```\nThis is not very illuminating as this just shows the default toString() method on the sketch. To get value from it we need to call methods on the LongsSketch object. Let's get estimates of the frequencies of the values 1 and 9.\nWe can fetch all cardinalities for all the vertices using the following code:\njava\nfinal GetElements query = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .input(new EdgeSeed(\"A\", \"B\", DirectedType.UNDIRECTED))\n        .build();\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> edges = graph.execute(query, user);\nfinal Element edge = edges.iterator().next();\nfinal com.yahoo.sketches.frequencies.LongsSketch longsSketch = (com.yahoo.sketches.frequencies.LongsSketch) edge.getProperty(\"longsSketch\");\nfinal String estimates = \"Edge A-B: 1L seen approximately \" + longsSketch.getEstimate(1L)\n        + \" times, 9L seen approximately \" + longsSketch.getEstimate(9L) + \" times.\";\nThe results are as follows. As 1000 edges were generated with a long randomly sampled from 0 to 9 then the occurrence of each is approximately 100.\n```\nEdge A-B: 1L seen approximately 106 times, 9L seen approximately 98 times.\n```\nUnion\nThe code for this example is UnionSketch.\nThis example demonstrates how the Union sketch from the Data Sketches library can be used to maintain estimates of the cardinalities of sets. The Union sketch is similar to a HyperLogLogPlusPlus, but it can also be used to create the intersections of sets. We give an example of how this can be used to monitor the changes to the number of edges in the graph over time.\nProperties class: com.yahoo.sketches.theta.Union\nPredicates:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.And\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsA\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsEqual\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsIn\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Not\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Or\n\nAggregators:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.theta.binaryoperator.UnionAggregator\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.First\n\nTo Bytes Serialisers:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.theta.serialisation.UnionSerialiser\n\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema.

For each edge, an Entity was created, with a vertex called \"graph\". This contained a Union object to which a string consisting of the source and destination was added. 500 edges were added to the graph for the day 10/01/2017. Of these, 250 were the same as edges that had been added in the previous day, but 250 were new. Again, for each edge, an Entity was created for the vertex called \"graph\".\nHere is the Entity for the different days:\n```\nEntity[vertex=graph,group=size,properties=Properties[size=com.yahoo.sketches.theta.UnionImpl@1d75e7af,endDate=Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 GMT 2017,startDate=Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 GMT 2017]]\nEntity[vertex=graph,group=size,properties=Properties[size=com.yahoo.sketches.theta.UnionImpl@34b27915,endDate=Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 GMT 2017,startDate=Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 GMT 2017]]\n```\nThis is not very illuminating as this just shows the default toString() method on the sketch. To get value from it we need to call a method on the Union object:\njava\nfinal GetAllElements getAllEntities2 = new GetAllElements.Builder()\n        .view(new View.Builder()\n                .entity(\"size\")\n                .build())\n        .build();\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> allEntities2 = graph.execute(getAllEntities2, user);\nfinal CloseableIterator<? extends Element> it = allEntities2.iterator();\nfinal Element entityDay1 = it.next();\nfinal CompactSketch sketchDay1 = ((Union) entityDay1.getProperty(\"size\")).getResult();\nfinal Element entityDay2 = it.next();\nfinal CompactSketch sketchDay2 = ((Union) entityDay2.getProperty(\"size\")).getResult();\nfinal double estimateDay1 = sketchDay1.getEstimate();\nfinal double estimateDay2 = sketchDay2.getEstimate();\nThe result is:\n```\n1000.0\n500.0\n```\nNow we can get an estimate for the number of edges in common across the two days:\njava\nfinal Intersection intersection = Sketches.setOperationBuilder().buildIntersection();\nintersection.update(sketchDay1);\nintersection.update(sketchDay2);\nfinal double intersectionSizeEstimate = intersection.getResult().getEstimate();\nThe result is:\n```\n250.0\n```\nWe now get an estimate for the number of edges in total across the two days, by simply aggregating overall the properties:\njava\nfinal GetAllElements getAllEntities = new GetAllElements.Builder()\n        .view(new View.Builder()\n                .entity(\"size\", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()\n                        .groupBy() // set the group by properties to 'none'\n                        .build())\n                .build())\n        .build();\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> allEntities = graph.execute(getAllEntities, user);\nfinal Element entity = allEntities.iterator().next();\nfinal double unionSizeEstimate = ((Union) entity.getProperty(\"size\")).getResult().getEstimate();\nThe result is:\n```\n1250.0\n```\nReservoirItemsUnion\nThe code for this example is ReservoirItemsUnion.\nThis example demonstrates how the ReservoirItemsUnion sketch from the Data Sketches library can be used to maintain estimates of properties on vertices and edges. The ReservoirItemsUnion sketch allows a sample of a set of strings to be maintained. We give two examples of this. The first is if when an edge is observed there is a string property associated to it, and there are a lot of different values of that string. We may not want to store all the different values of the string, but we may want to see a random sample of them. The second example is to store on an Entity a sketch which gives a sample of the vertices that are connected to the vertex. Even if we are storing all the edges then producing a random sample of the vertices attached to a vertex may not be quick (for example if a vertex has degree 10,000 then producing a sample of a random 10 neighbours would require scanning all the edges - storing the sketch on the Entity means that the sample will be precomputed and can be returned without scanning the edges).\nProperties class: com.yahoo.sketches.sampling.ReservoirItemsUnion\nPredicates:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.And\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Exists\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsA\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsEqual\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsIn\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Not\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.Or\n\nAggregators:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.sampling.binaryoperator.ReservoirItemsUnionAggregator\nuk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.First\n\nTo Bytes Serialisers:\n\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.sampling.serialisation.ReservoirNumbersUnionSerialiser\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.datasketches.sampling.serialisation.ReservoirStringsUnionSerialiser\n\nElements schema\nThis is our new elements schema.

For each of these edges, an Entity was created for both the source and destination. Each Entity contained a 'neighboursSample' property that contains the vertex at the other end of the edge.

Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. New serialisation documentation for the wiki:\nSerialisers\nGaffer will automatically choose serialisers for you for some core types.\nWhere possible you should let Gaffer choose for you, as it will choose the optimal\nserialiser for the type and your usage.\nFor custom types you will need to write your own serialiser. When manually\nchoosing a serialiser for your schema you will need to take the following into\nconsideration.\nFor vertex serialisation and groupBy properties you must choose serialisers that\nare consistent. A consistent serialiser will serialise the equal objects into\nexactly the same values (bytes). For example the JavaSerialiser and\nFreqMapSerialiser are not consistent.\nWhen using an ordered store (a store that implements the ORDERED StoreTrait),\nthis includes Accumulo and HBase, you need to check whether the serialisers are\nordered.\n\nfor vertex serialisation you must use a serialiser that is ordered\nfor groupBy properties we recommend using a serialiser that is ordered, however it is not essential. In fact it will not cause any problems at present. In the future we plan to add features that would only be available to you if your groupBy properties are serialised using ordered serialisers.\nall other properties can be serialised with ordered/unordered serialisers.\n. Merged into develop.. So basically all implementations of Operation needs to override/implement the shallowClone method. This is intended to be a very shallow clone - simply just creating a new instance of the operation and copying all the fields across (without cloning the fields).\n\nFor example for AddElements:\n```java\npublic AddElements shallowClone() {\n    return new AddElements.Builder()\n        .validate(validate)\n        .skipInvalidElements(skipInvalidElements)\n        .input(elements)\n        .options(options)\n        .build();\n}\nThen adding a unit test to check all fields were copied successfully..

Currently we validate the entire operation chain before it is executed. If the GetElements operation is used in a chain then the input will initially be null. It is only set after the previous operation in the chain is executed. So we would need to add a secondary validation stage, so in addition to validating at the beginning of the chain, we would need to validate just before we execute each individual operation.\nCurrently the GetElements input is just validated in the GetElementsHandler classes.\n@ac74475 - I'm assuming this bug only applies to the ParquetStore?.

I've started work on this on branch gh-1179-remove-properties. It seems to work ok but it needs unit testing. We should also add some integration tests to the integration-test suite to ensure all stores implement it. I've created a utility method ViewUtil.removeProperties(view, element) so it is very simple for new stores to implement it.\nInitially this has been implemented in a very simple generic way in the various stores. In the Accumulo Store and Parquet Store we should be able to optimise this and only fetch/deserialise the properties we need - but that could be done in a separate issue.\nWe also need to update the documentation..

Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. I've just noticed that the SchemaOptimiser.addDefaultSerialisers and SchemaOptimiser.getDefaultVertexSerialiser also need to be updated. We should pick serialisers that are consistent for the vertex serialiser and groupBy properties.\nUnfortunately this will mean a potential migration step for users. Any users that have existing data need to manually hardcode all the serialisers they are currently using in their schema to avoid different ones being used. Similar to the migration steps for this issue: https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/988. Hi Amanda,\nThe best way to implement it would be as a new Gaffer Operation. That way you can write the logic in Java and register the Operation in Gaffer so it can be easily executed just like you would execute a GetElements operation. Alternatively you can write the logic in some other language and execute Operations on the REST API.\nTo write a new Operation that you would need to write 2 files:\n- an implementation of Operation to hold the config/inputs for your algorithm, e.g for Shortest Path that class could have: Object start, Object end, Integer maxHops.\n- an implementation of OperationOutputHandler. This is the class where the algorithm logic should live. Deciding how to write that logic is the hard bit. You have several options - see below.\nOnce you have these 2 classes you can then register them with the Store.\nWe are hoping to start work on these sorts of operations in a few months time. We have done some work on exporting to GraphX in issue #792.\nIn terms of the algorithm logic, you could write the algorithm logic yourself and make calls to other operations like GetAdjacentIds to hop around the graph. The specific logic would be different depending on the types of Entities and Edges you have in your Graph. For example we suggest adding a Cardinality Entity to all vertices so you can get a quick estimate of how connected a vertex is. If your graph has these Cardinalities then you can use these in your algorithm, in shortest path you could make use of these to help decide which edges to traverse down.\nAlternatively you could delegate to one of the spark operations like GetRDDOfAllElements or export to GraphX.\nHope that helps.. Merged into develop.. @supamanda - that sounds like a great improvement. \nIt would be good to get that change to the GetRDDOfAllElements included, either by default or as a configurable option.\nWe should also update the AccumuloStore README to add a some information to tell users to try and increase the value of the table.scan.max.memory property if they experience issues with the spark operations.\nWould you be able to make those changes and contribute your changes back to Gaffer? You just need to sign our contributors license and it might be worth having a quick look at our ways of working. Then just create a Pull Request from your forked Gaffer repository back into our develop branch.\nIf that is not possible, we could make the changes - just let us know.. Merged into develop..

Merged into hotfix-0.7.9.. # Migration Steps\nAll operations must now have an options field. The Operation interface has been updated to include a getter and setter for options.

As we add more examples to the DefaultExamplesFactory the number of if statements is going to grow quite quickly and will soon become a bit of a mess. We should use this issue to refactor the logic and perhaps register the example operations in a HashMap of Class<? extends Operation> to Operation. So instead of using if(class instanceof GetElements) we can just pull out the example from the HashMap.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop..

Thanks @gaffer01. \n\nGetPaths is much better - I've update the issue to refer to GetPaths instead of Path.\nA Path class is a good idea, if it extended something like ArrayList then we could still process it as a List. The Path class would then just override add and addAll to validate the Path is connected.\nYes we need to use the MatchedVertex to ensure we extract the opposite vertex. I actually added a comment about this a few days ago on the pull request for this issue.\nConfiguring the operation with a list of GetElements operations means each hop could be down a different Edge group with different filters. So yes, I think all of those paths should be valid.\nWe had planned to allow Entities and Entity filtering in a future issue, to reduce the complexity of this initial issue. Currently we just validate and say no Entities are allow in the Views.\nAgreed it is complex, however the flexibility it is really powerful. Yes, we could extend the GetPaths operation and make simpler versions of it.. Yes that distance field would be helpful.\n\nThe getVerticesAtDistance(n) is something we need to be able to do. However, I had imagined we would use a generic operation to do it, see - #1345.. Merged into develop.. Yes I agree with @gaffer01. But no, this is a very small issue, separate to applying Store Validation in the Parquet Store, which will be done in #1100. I've added this comment to #1100:\nCurrently the Parquet Store has special implementations for primitive predicates for some of Gaffer/Koryphe's core predicates like IsMoreThan. See ParquetFilterUtils.addPrimitiveFilter. I believe this means the IsMoreThan predicate can be applied more efficiently. AgeOff is just another predicate that is quite simple and #1303 is to add specific logic in ParquetFilterUtils to deal with the AgeOff predicate efficiently in a similar way to IsMoreThan.\nSo this issue is to simply add a bit of logic to handle the AgeOff Predicate in a similar way to IsMoreThan in ParquetFilterUtils.. This has been done as part of #1100.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Should be done after #1321 . This is not really specific to the FederatedStore, but to any properties or schema that are persisted in the Graph Library that need to be updated. We need a mechanism for updating schemas/properties in the Graph Library. For now users will have to manually update the GraphLibrary before using it.. #1430 will add a AddSchema and AddStoreProperties operations, which will fix this issue too.. This is due to the way the Graph class handles the schema. When the Graph is first initialised, the Graph class keeps a copy of the original schema. When a new graph is added to the FederatedStore, the Graph's original schema is not updated.\nWhen you call graph.getSchema() or hit the graph/config/schema end point it actually returns this original schema instance.\nTo make it consistent, we could change it so that graph.getSchema always returns an empty schema for a federated store.. This has been fixed as a result of #1365. graph.getSchema() now will always just return an empty schema.. Merged into develop.. Let's hold off merging this in until we have released the patch version 1.0.1.. This may mean we have to refactor the FederatedAccessHook. The logic may need to live in the FederatedStore instead so it can be reused.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop..

Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. This is linked to #1301.. After #1301 is done, we should then be able to create an Operation perhaps called 'ExtractItems'.\nThis would take an Iterable of Iterables and and returns an Iterable if the extracted item.\nE.g\nInput = \n[\n[1a, 2a, 3a],\n[1b, 2b, 3b],\n[1c, 2b, 3c]\n]\nand we ask to extract the second item out of the iterables then the result would be:\n[2a, 2b, 2c]\nThis would allow us to create an Operation Chain like this:\nPath(some seeds),\nExtractItems(0)   - extract the first edge in each path\nToVertices(MATCHED_VERTEX)  - this extracts the original seeds\n@gchqdev03 - would that work for you?. OK great. However, @javadev001001 - I'm not sure what you mean by 'pick up' properties?. @m607123 the way your code currently looks seems to be going in the right direction. It allows users to plug in any map Function or flatMap Function so they can extract whatever they want.\nSo I would imagine they would do something like:\n- GetWalks\nThis would return something like:\njson\n[\n    [[1-2], [2-3], [3-4]],\n    [[1-5], [5-6], [6-7]]\n]\n\nFlatMap(FirstItem)\n\nThis would return:\njson\n[\n    [1-2],\n    [1-5]\n]\n\n\nFlatMap(FirstItem)\nThis would return:\njson\n[\n    1-2,\n    1-5\n]\n\n\nMap(Extract matched vertex - this might need to be a new function)\nWhich would return:\njson\n[\n    1,\n    1\n]\n\n\nToSet\nThe deduplicated results:\njson\n[\n    1\n]\n\n\nA bit complicated but quite descriptive. Perhaps we could have a function that merges the first 2 flatmap operations into 1.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. A workaround for the time being is to rename the property in the schema to \"empty\" (or something similar) then tell Gaffer to serialise/deserialise it with a NullSerialiser (see below).\nThis way the property would never be added to the Properties map on an element - so it would never be seen by a user.\n```java\npublic class NullSerialiser extends ToBytesSerialiser {\n    @Override\n    public boolean canHandle(final Class clazz) {\n        return true;\n    }\n@Override\npublic byte[] serialise(final Object value) throws SerialisationException {\n    return new byte[0];\n}\n\n@Override\npublic Object deserialise(final byte[] bytes) throws SerialisationException {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic Object deserialiseEmpty() {\n    return null;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean preservesObjectOrdering() {\n    return true;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean isConsistent() {\n    return true;\n}\n\n}\n``` . @gaffer01 yes the ticket is to actually remove the property from everywhere. \nMy workaround above is just an idea to help in the meantime. It would stop the property being returned in queries, but yes it may remain in the store.. Removing a property from elements in Accumulo is hard and could take a lot of computation. There are a few options:\n- Inspect the R files directly and remove the bytes.\n- MapReduce: load the entire table, transform the elements and write the elements back out into R files. Create a new table and load the R files back in.\n- Write a custom Accumulo Iterator that can modify the element properties. This would only work on non-group properties.\n- Reuse the property for something else: rename it in the schema and create a custom serialiser that can handle both the old type and the new type. When the bytes are read out of accumulo the serialiser could determine whether it is the old type and if it is set it to null, otherwise just use the new value.. This is linked to #128. Ideally we would create a generic operation that could be applied to any Gaffer store. Then each store can choose if and how to implement the migration.. OK, how about we add the Operation: \"RemoveProperties\" and implement it just for the MapStore. Other Stores have implement it separately.\nThe operation could have these 2 fields:\n```java\n/*\n * A Map of entity group names to properties to be removed.\n /\nprivate Map> entityProperties;\n/*\n * A Map of edge group names to properties to be removed.\n /\nprivate Map> edgeProperties;\n```\nWe should start by validating that the schema actually contains the properties. The store should fully delete the properties and update all references to the schema accordingly including the reference in the GraphLibrary.\n. Merged into develop.. Hi @PammyS,\nYes it is still open, thank you. \nIt looks like @m607123 did some work on it on branch gh-1360-validate-user-operations, but I'm not sure how far he got with it. Either work off his branch or feel free to start again and branch off develop.\nJust make sure you have signed our Contributors License Agreement\n@GCHQDeveloper404 - can you add a description to this issue please..

Merged into develop.. When using the Aggregator:\nIf you don't supply any groups then it should default to using all groups, similar to the Filter Operation (perhaps also check the Transform Operation)\nIf you aggregate a transient property then the validation fails as it can't find the class of the transient property. Perhaps just skip the validation for transient properties.\nI don't think we need the 'else' block on line 138 of the AggregateValidator.\nPlease can you check all 3 operations in the REST API too..

Instead Gaffer will create a SparkSession for you. If you have an instance of SparkSession that you want to use then this can be added to the User Context and submitted when you execute your job.\nInstead of:\njava\ngraph.execute(operation, new User(\"User01\"))\nyou can supply the sparkSession like this:\njava\nContext context = SparkContextUtil.createContext(new User(\"User01\"), sparkSession);\ngraph.execute(operation, context);\nFor Spark Operation examples see our doc.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Rather than always creating a SparkSession, if possible we should do it lazily.

Merged into develop.. Hi Amanda,\nNot at the moment. Currently you would just have to store the Edge both ways around. I don't think it would be too hard to update the Edge class to allow the direction to set to bidirectional. I'll add it to the backlog of issues.\nIs it something that you would use if we implemented it?\nThanks.. @supamanda - regarding the validation, I believe you have this in your schema:\n```json\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"NetflowCount\": {\n      ...\n      \"directed\": \"true\",\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"true\": {\n      \"description\": \"A simple boolean that must always be true.\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\",\n      \"validateFunctions\": [\n        {\n          \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsTrue\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nIf you want to allow both directed and undirected direction values to be set then you could just rename the \"true\" type to \"either\" and then just delete the IsTrue validation function. The result would be:\n```json\n{\n  \"edges\": {\n    \"NetflowCount\": {\n      ...\n      \"directed\": \"either\",\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n{\n  \"types\": {\n    \"either\": {\n      \"description\": \"A simple boolean that can be true or false\",\n      \"class\": \"java.lang.Boolean\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```.

It is also missing other Gaffer and Koryphe dependencies. It was assumed that this shaded jar would be used alongside the Accumulo shaded iterators jar. To allow it to be used without the accumulo jar I will add all dependencies to each of the shaded library jars - road-traffic-generators, bitmap-library, time-library, sketches-library.. I've made the code changes but it significantly increases the file size of those shaded jars. Not sure we really want to do that.. To avoid coupling libraries together and to keep the file sizes smaller, we will keep these shaded jars distinct and require users to always use the accumulo shaded jar and then any of the extra libraries they want..

We should create a new module within the library module: graph-analytic-library.\nThe PageRank operation should go in there.\nThe PageRank operation should have a generic input type and a generic output type.\nThe PageRank operation should not have a dependency on Spark or GraphFrames, but allow an operation handler to implement it in anyway it wants to. This would cause the input/output types to be unpredictable. So, perhaps in addition to PageRank we need GraphFramePageRank so users can be sure what the input and output type should be.\nWithin the spark module we will also need to add a new module: spark-graph-analytic-library.\nThen add a GraphFramesPageRank operation in there that extends PageRank. The handler for the graph frames operation can also go in this module. Perhaps we should implement 2 handlers one for PageRank and one for GraphFramesPageRank. The handler could do:\nif(!(operation.getInput() instanceof GraphFrame) {\n// extract a graph frame first.\n}\nThen a Gaffer system could have multiple versions of PageRank using different technologies all available at the same time via different operations. But, if a user doesn't care how the operation is implemented they could just use the top level PageRank operation.\n. This issue is basically ready to be merged in, except for an issue with performance that needs to be investigated.. Ideally we would probably not want to allow names to start with a | or a - however, making that change now could result in a breaking change for some users. So for now we will just have to allow it, so what you have done looks good.. Merged into develop.. @gaffer01 I've made a couple of changes to your branch. Please let me know if you are happy with them.. Hi @PammyS,\nSorry I hadn't seen the commit @m607123 had made on his branch until now. It looks like you may have been led down the wrong path. I think the validation should really have gone in the Graph class in one place at the starting point for all interactions with Gaffer.\nI think we need to add something like the following to line 199 in Graph, just after the null check for the operationChain parameter:\n```java\nif(null == context) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"A context containing a user is required\");\n}\nif(null == context.getUser()) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"The context does not contain a user\");\n}\n```\nThe only other thing required would be some simple unit tests to check the validation. The testing should go in GraphTest. There are several different entry points to test, each with a null context or null user.\ngraph.execute(OperationChain, Context)\ngraph.execute(OperationChain, User)\ngraph.executeJob(OperationChain, Context)\ngraph.executeJob(OperationChain, User)\nAn example test for graph.execute(OperationChain, Context) is:\n```java\n@Test\npublic void shouldThrowExceptionOnExecuteWithANullContext() throws OperationException {\n    // Given\n    final Context context = null;\n    final OperationChain opChain = mock(OperationChain.class);\nfinal Graph graph = new Graph.Builder()\n        .config(new GraphConfig.Builder()\n                .graphId(GRAPH_ID)\n                .build())\n        .storeProperties(StreamUtil.storeProps(getClass()))\n        .addSchemas(StreamUtil.schemas(getClass()))\n        .build();\n\n// When / Then\ntry {\n    graph.execute(opChain, context);\n    fail(\"Exception expected\");\n} catch (final IllegalArgumentException e) {\n    assertEquals(\"A context containing a user is required\", e.getMessage());\n}\n\n}\n```\nI'll leave you to test the other bits.\n. Closing this pull request as this has been replaced by #1448.. The tests look good, thank you! \nJust noticed a couple of issues highlighted by the Travis CI build:\n\nour checkstyle has failed due to missing whitespace around 'if' in the code you added to Graph.\nyou can run checkstyle on the project using the command \"mvn clean verify -Panalyze\". If you just want to run checkstyle on one module, e.g graph, then you can do \"mvn clean verify -Panalyze -pl :graph\".\nAs a result of your change it highlights a couple of issues in our code elsewhere which caused tests to fail:\nin GafferResultCacheExporter can you change \"context.getUser()\" to just \"context\" on lines 121 and 138.\nin FederatedOperationHandler can you also change \"context.getUser()\" to just \"context\" on line 46.\n\nThat should get the tests to pass. You can verify the code builds successfully using: \n\"mvn clean install\", although this may take about 10 minutes to run. If you want to just test the modules you have changed (e.g graph and federated-store) you can do something like:\n\"mvn clean install -Pquick\" followed by \"mvn clean install -pl :graph,:federated-store\". @PammyS - if you would like to pick up another issue, that would be great. Here are few other beginner issues that will help introduce you to some of our different Operations: #1449, #1450, #1451, #1452.. Merged into develop.. Just need to make a couple of changes. . Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. @GCHQDeveloper404 please can you add some more detail to this issue?. Looks great, thank you. Just need to fix the checkstyle warnings. Unfortunately Travis CI doesn't log the actual errors just the module that failed checkstyle, the core-rest module. So I've just checked out the code and run:\nbash\n mvn clean install -pl :core-rest -am -Pquick\n mvn verify -Panalyze -pl :core-rest\nand it lists the errors:\nrest-api/core-rest/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/rest/service/v2/example/DefaultExamplesFactory.java:399:62: error: '{' is not preceded with whitespace.\nrest-api/core-rest/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/rest/service/v2/example/ExamplesFactory.java:27: error: Wrong order for 'uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.compare.Sort' import.\nrest-api/core-rest/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/rest/service/v2/example/ExamplesFactory.java:27:8: error: Unused import - uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.compare.Sort.. Brilliant thanks!. They all look good and seem to work nicely. If you haven't already you can see these examples in action you can start up the rest api using:\nbash\nmvn clean install -Pquick -Proad-traffic-demo -pl :road-traffic-demo -am\nThen you will see the swagger ui if you go to:  http://localhost:8080/rest/\nThen if you expand the \"operations\" then \"/graph/operations/execute\" section you will see a dropdown menu. Within that dropdown list there are all the Operations. If you select Min or Max or ToMap then click \"Add Example\" you will see that your example gets serialised into json and added to the input box to the left. This allows users to get an example operation template that they can then manipulate and use.\nAs an improvement, it would be nice to avoid hardcoding the strings \"entity\", \"edge\" and \"count\". It would be better to use the getAnEdgeGroup() and getAnEdgePropertyName() methods to dynamically inspect the current Graph and select a valid string based on the schema. \nSo instead of:\njava\nfinal Max max = new Max.Builder()\n                .comparators(new ElementPropertyComparator.Builder()\n                        .groups(\"entity\", \"edge\")\n                        .property(\"count\")\n                        .build())\n                .build();\nwe could have:\njava\nfinal Max max = new Max.Builder()\n                .comparators(new ElementPropertyComparator.Builder()\n                        .groups(getAnEdgeGroup())\n                        .property(getAnEdgePropertyName())\n                        .build())\n                .build();\nThis same improvement could be applied to Min, Max, ToMap and Sort. If we make this change then when we start the Road Traffic Demo Rest Api (as described above) you will see it uses a valid group name like \"RoadUse\" and valid property name like \"startDate\".\n. @PammyS the values for reverse, deduplicate, resultLimit can just be hardcoded - they are just example values and would work for any Gaffer Graph, they don't rely on a specific schema.\nto get an example vertex you can use:\njava\nfinal String group = getAnEntityGroup();\nfinal SchemaElementDefinition entityDef = getSchema().getEntity(group);\ngetExampleVertex(entityDef.getIdentifierClass(IdentifierType.VERTEX), 1)\nto get an example source:\njava\n final String group = getAnEdgeGroup();\n final SchemaElementDefinition edgeDef = getSchema().getEdge(group);\ngetExampleVertex(edgeDef.getIdentifierClass(IdentifierType.SOURCE), 2)\n. @PammyS - I've just taken a look at your ToMap example and seen where you are trying to insert the source and vertex values. The \"source\" string is actually a string representing the key in the output map, so it can be any value you want. So if you put \"some string\" as the source value the output map would contain:\n{\n    \"some string\": theSourceValue\n}\nSo I would recommend something like:\njava\n final ToMap toMap = new ToMap.Builder()\n                .generator(new MapGenerator.Builder()\n                        .group(getAnEdgeGroup())\n                        .source(\"the edge source\")\n                        .property(getAnEdgePropertyName(), \"the edge property \" + getAnEdgePropertyName())\n                        .build())\n                .build();\nThanks for highlighting the lack of documentation around those classes. I've added a new issue #1463 to update the documentation for the MapGenerator class to inform users how to configure it.. Closing whilst we consider removing schema and store properties IDs. See #1477.. I've done most of the code required on branch gh-1462-getschema. It still needs some unit tests writing.. Merged into develop.. Closing while changes are made.. # Migration Steps\nThere is no breaking change and no immediate migration required. However, the SplitStore operation has been deprecated and we recommend you update to use SplitStoreFromFile when possible.. Merged into develop.. @gaffer01 - I switched to using a flatMap function to reduce the nested iterable. However, flink calls the sink with each individual element, whether or not I use an iterable in the flatMap. There doesn't seem to be a way around that.\nI've changed the queue of elements we give to AddElements to be a blocking queue with a maximum customisable size (defaults to 1,000,000). If the queue is full then flink will be blocked from adding more elements. This should fix the back pressure issue.\nI've also added some more javadoc.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. After our discussion ExtractItems should be converted to a Map operation which takes a function to map the iterable input. We will also need a NthItem function to allow us to extract the nth item.. This operation is not specific to the federated store, so it should be moved into core gaffer. The operation should be registered if the GraphLibrary is not an instance of NoGraphLibrary.. Closed while changes are implemented.. The federated cache PR should be merged into first.. @GCHQDeveloper404 - the AddSchema and AddStoreProperties operations need an \"id\" field. This should be marked as required. Since we have deprecated the id fields in Schema and StoreProperties we need users to provide the ID separately. Please can you also update your unit tests to use the pattern described in our ways of working.. This will be done as part of #1472.. Merged into develop.. Closing while changes are made.. I've made some changed and pushed to branch gh-1435-FederatedStore-getTraits-v2. @GCHQDeveloper404 - please can you check if you are happy with the changes.\nIt looks like this branch is branched off 1430, so 1430 should be merged in first..

So if systems want to display contact information they can include it in their description.. Merged into develop.. Where should the option go? \nIf a user executes an operation chain containing multiple operations, the option should only be required in one place, perhaps on the OperationChain object. \nIf a user executes a single operation, then the option would have to go on that single operation. \nSo basically it just needs to go on the outermost operation. Would that be obvious enough for a user?. @m607123 yeah I suppose we could just scan all operations and see if any of operation has the debug option set.. I've been looking into this and as we already have the gaffer.error-mode.debug property that can enable/disable debugging. If a system admin wants to allow users of Gaffer to view full stack traces of the exceptions then they should enable the debug property. I don't think users then need to worry about disabling/enable debug for specific queries.. Closing until #1513 is fixed.. This is a low priority, if there is a simple quick fix then we should apply it, otherwise it is not worth doing at the moment.. Merged into develop.. We should create a new module within the library module: graph-analytic-library.\nThe GetShortestPath operation should go in there.\nWithin the spark module we will also need to add a new module: spark-graph-analytic-library.\nThe GraphFrames GetShortestPathHandler should go in there.\nThe GetShortestPath operation should not have a dependency on Spark or GraphFrames, but allow an operation handler to implement it in anyway it wants to. This would cause the output type to be unpredictable. Perhaps in addition to GetShortestPath we need GetShortestPathAsGraphFrame so users can be sure what the output type will be.. A similar Function for converting DataFrames and RDDs back to Elements would be useful too. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Closing while changes are made.. @gaffer01 - thanks for the comments. I've made your suggested changes. I've deprecated SplitStore and created SplitStoreFromFile and SplitStoreFromIterable. The SplitStoreFromFile reads the file locally or in HDFS then delegates to SplitStoreFromIterable. Sorry there are quite a few more files to review now.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Hi @supamanda,\nThanks for pointing this out. I've just been investigating it and I believe we have a problem with AddElementsFromHdfs for elements with aggregation disabled.\nThe AddElementsFromHdfs triggers a MapReduce job and it looks like it will deduplicate elements that have an identical Key (Same source, destination, direction, group, groupBy properties).\nTo work around this issue I think you have the following options:\n- add a unique property to the groupBy. If you were to add something like a random number or the timestamp (assuming it is unique but I suppose that is not guaranteed) then the Key would be different and the MapReduce job wouldn't deduplicate them.\n- enabling aggregation for that group and defining aggregators for the properties.\n- don't use AddElementsFromHdfs - instead just add the data via one of the other mechanisms, like AddElements or AddElementsFromKafka.\nI haven't looked into a fix yet. When we have an idea of the complexity I will update you with a timescale.. OK, looks like the fix is going to be quite straight forward. I'm just testing it now. \nI'm aiming to release a patch by the end of Wednesday.. Merged into develop.. Hi @supamanda,\nThis has now been fixed and released in version 1.1.1. Thanks again for spotting the issue and sorry for the hassle. Please let us know how you get on with it in version 1.1.1.. OK. If it is not too much effort, it would definitely be worth upgrading to 1.8.1 - there are some significant performance improvements for ingest and Gaffer is now built against 1.8.1.

Merged into develop.. # Migration Steps\nThis migration only applies to you if you are using the experimental FederatedStore. \nWhen a Graph is added to the FederatedStore the graph is no longer added to the GraphLibrary so you cannot refer to the graphId when adding future Graphs to the the FederatedStore..

Closing while changes are made.. Hi @supamanda,\nLooks perfect. Thank you!\nI just restarted the travis ci - rest api tests and they passed. Travis CI can be a bit temperamental at times.. Currently the ProxyStore generates new exceptions with complex error messages. If the delegate REST server returns a Gaffer Error object as a response, we should just deserialise it and use the contents of that in the Proxy Store exception.. Merged into develop..

Closing while changes are made.. Merged into develop.. This will be done as part of #1565.. Merged into develop.. To fix this we will set the timestamp to 1 for all elements. This field is only used if you set the timestampProperty field in your schema. In this case you will need to populate the field yourself, otherwise the value will be defaulted to 1.. # Migration Steps\nImportant - if you have set the timestampProperty in your schema and are using the Accumulo/HBase store this applies to you.\nPreviously, if you didn't manually set the timestamp value on an element these stores would set the value for you to the current time. This has caused several problems and therefore will no longer happen. If you want to the current time or a different value you will need to set it yourself.\nIn Accumulo the default timestamp value will now be 1. \nIn HBase the default timestamp value will now be a random value based on the current time and a random number.\nSetting the timestampProperty field in a schema for these stores is now deemed an advanced feature and should only be used if you really understand the effects. We recommend you don't use the timestampProperty in the schema.. Fixed as part of #1565.. Merged into develop.. Just been looking into moving it into a store property. It does cause the Accumulo key packages to become a bit untidy. They now need to know about the schema and this new timestamp property. Also,  any classes that serialise/deserialise the key packages also need to know about this new property.\nI think the timestamp property should still be part of the schema, as it is applicable to a given schema. If we put it in the store properties then those properties are tied to the schema and they should be independent.\nPerhaps we create a new config field in the Schema. This could be useful in other ways for other stores too. This config field would allow advanced users to set the timestampProperty for use in Accumulo/HBase. I've created a pull request to demonstrate this.. Agreed. We have a nice modular schema approach where you can split your schema up into small modules. Elements and types are the normal 2. But we suggest you can split out aggregation if you want to apply the schema to a  2 stores, one that supports aggregation and one that doesn't. Similarly you could split out the config into a separate schema that you use only when running on Accumulo.. Merged into develop.. # Migration Steps\nNo migrations steps required, however the \"timestampProperty\" field in the schema has been deprecated.  In Gaffer version 2.0 this will likely be removed.\nInstead of setting the timestampProperty you will need to add a config setting to the schema. We do not recommend using this, it is an advanced feature. However, if you have existing data then you must continue using this feature and will need to migrate to using the Schema config instead. For example, if you previously had a schema like:\njson\n{\n    \"timestampProperty\": \"time\"\n}\nthis should be replaced with:\njson\n{\n    \"config\": {\n        \"timestampProperty\": \"time\"\n    }\n}. Merged into develop.. @gaffer01 - actually properties within groups that have aggregation disabled do not need to have aggregators defined.\nSo if you tried to apply query aggregation to a non-aggregated group there may not be any aggregators defined. So currently if you disable aggregation for a group it is completely disabled, both ingest and query. \nYou could use the Aggregate operation in a chain to apply aggregation separately and when you run that operation you can specify aggregate functions to use for the different properties. This aggregation would normally just be done on a single node in a single jvm.. Merged into develop.. I added some notes to the #1438 issue last week. Let me know what you think..

Hi @supamanda \nThanks for raising the issue, but I'm struggling to reproduce it. I've written this basic unit test to test it and it seems to work ok. Perhaps it is due to the data or schema you are using. Please could you update the unit test below so that it fails for you?\n```java\n@Test\npublic void testGetAllElementsInRDDWithView() throws Exception {\n        // Create graph\n        final MiniAccumuloCluster cluster = MiniAccumuloClusterProvider.getMiniAccumuloCluster();\n        final AccumuloProperties properties = MiniAccumuloClusterProvider.getAccumuloProperties();\n        properties.setKeyPackageClass(ByteEntityKeyPackage.class.getName());\n        final Graph graph = new Graph.Builder()\n                .config(new GraphConfig.Builder()\n                        .graphId(\"testTable\")\n                        .build())\n                .addSchema(new Schema.Builder()\n                        .edge(\"Netflow\", new SchemaEdgeDefinition.Builder()\n                                .source(\"string\")\n                                .destination(\"string\")\n                                .directed(\"true\")\n                                .aggregate(false)\n                                .build())\n                        .edge(\"NetflowCount\", new SchemaEdgeDefinition.Builder()\n                                .source(\"string\")\n                                .destination(\"string\")\n                                .directed(\"true\")\n                                .property(\"count\", \"count\")\n                                .aggregate(true)\n                                .build())\n                        .type(\"string\", new TypeDefinition.Builder()\n                                .clazz(String.class)\n                                .build())\n                        .type(\"true\", new TypeDefinition.Builder()\n                                .clazz(Boolean.class)\n                                .validateFunctions(new IsTrue())\n                                .build())\n                        .type(\"count\", new TypeDefinition.Builder()\n                                .clazz(Long.class)\n                                .aggregateFunction(new Sum())\n                                .build())\n                        .build())\n                .storeProperties(properties)\n                .build();\n    // Add elements\n    graph.execute(new AddElements.Builder()\n            .input(new Edge.Builder()\n                            .group(\"Netflow\")\n                            .source(\"1\")\n                            .dest(\"2\")\n                            .directed(true)\n                            .build(),\n                    new Edge.Builder()\n                            .group(\"NetflowCount\")\n                            .source(\"1\")\n                            .dest(\"2\")\n                            .directed(true)\n                            .property(\"count\", 1L)\n                            .build())\n            .build(), USER);\n\n    // Compact the table\n    cluster.getConnector(MiniAccumuloClusterProvider.ROOT, MiniAccumuloClusterProvider.PASSWORD)\n            .tableOperations()\n            .compact(\"testTable\", new CompactionConfig());\n    Thread.sleep(1000L);\n\n    // Execute operation\n    final GetRDDOfAllElements op = new GetRDDOfAllElements.Builder().\n            view(new View.Builder().edge(\"Netflow\").build()).\n            option(\"gaffer.accumulo.spark.directrdd.use_rfile_reader\", \"true\").\n            build();\n    final RDD<Element> rdd = graph.execute(op, new User());\n\n    // Validate results\n    final List<Element> results = Lists.newArrayList((Element[]) rdd.collect());\n    System.out.println(results);\n    assertEquals(\n            Lists.newArrayList(new Edge.Builder()\n                    .group(\"Netflow\")\n                    .source(\"1\")\n                    .dest(\"2\")\n                    .directed(true)\n                    .build()),\n            results\n    );\n\n}\n```.

The timestamp has now been changed so it is a constant for groups that are aggregated.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Hi @gregm-tnw,\nThe InRange predicate only works on Comparables. So unfortunately you can't apply the InRange predicate directly on RBMBackedTimestampSet. We/You would need to create a specific predicate that behaves like InTimeRange but checks if any of the timestamps within RBMBackedTimestampSet are within the provided range.. I've just been looking into the issue as to why it shows up in Swagger. It is because the InRange predicate takes a generic type and the reflection logic we use to determine whether RBMBackedTimestampSet can be applied to InRange doesn't handle generics very well. In this case it can't determine whether RBMBackedTimestampSet is applicable so it defaults to including InRange in the list.\nI've raised an issue on Koryphe to improve the way the generics used to validate the input types. Thanks for pointing this out.. Hi @gregm-tnw \nCurrently we don't have a generic Transform function that would allow this. That is quite a nice idea and probably very helpful. We could write a Transform function that takes in a method name and calls that method.\nPerhaps something like this:\n```java\npublic class CallMethod extends KorypheFunction {\n    private String method;\n@Override\npublic Object apply(final Object obj) {\n    if(null == obj) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    try {\n        final Method objMethod = obj.getClass().getMethod(method);\n        if (objMethod.isAccessible()) {\n            return objMethod.invoke(obj);\n        }\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Unable to invoke \" + method + \" on object class \" + obj.getClass() + \" as it is not accessible\");\n    } catch (final IllegalAccessException | InvocationTargetException | NoSuchMethodException e) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Unable to invoke \" + method + \" on object class \" + obj.getClass(), e);\n    }\n}\n\npublic String getMethod() {\n    return method;\n}\n\npublic void setMethod(final String method) {\n    this.method = method;\n}\n\n}\n```\nThis function could actually be added to the Koryphe project as it is not dependent on Gaffer.\nOtherwise, you could write your own custom Transform function that calls one of those getters. Once you have written it you just need to include it in your REST war file and you will be able to use it.. I've added the feature into the next milestone for Koryphe: https://github.com/gchq/koryphe/issues/94. Once this has been implemented and released, we will update the version of Koryphe in Gaffer.\nYou could use the code snippet above to create the function for your project and include it in your REST war file if you want to use it sooner.. This was released as part of Gaffer 1.5.0.. Hi @gregm-tnw,\nThanks for the suggestion. It is something we have thought about in the past and I agree it is something that would be useful. \nThe issue is, for our Accumulo implementation, the pre and post filters are pushed down to Accumulo's iterators. At the moment the transform and post transform filter stages happen within the single REST server JVM. \nIf we pushed the transform down to the iterators then the output from the transform would need to have an associated serialiser so it could be serialised back into bytes. Depending on what the user transformed, it could then break the Accumulo iterator. For example if a user wants to change the value of the source/destination or a groupBy property, then this would change the Key for the row in Accumulo and potentially cause the row to be out of order with the other rows.\nWe would need to introduce some sort of restricted transform that ensures serialisers are defined and ensures the transform only applies to non-groupBy properties. Or we need to work out a way of applying the transform in a way that doesn't break the accumulo iterators. If we do that then we could introduce your feature. And yes, that would be we would then be able to allow multiple sequences of filter-transform-filter-aggregate-filter.. Closing while changes are made.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop..

The MultiSerialiser will be able to handle the different vertex types, it shouldn't matter which way around the edge is.

I've tidied up a few bits and it looks like the work is almost complete. I think it might just need some tests writing for it.. After further discussion it would actually be better to split this generator up into 4 parts.\nCSV -> Tuples\nTuples -> Tuples   (manipulate the fields)\nTuples -> Elements\nElements -> Elements + Cardinality Entities\nThese could all be functions and used in a Map operation..

I have done some of the changes required on branch: gh-2090-add-named-op-authorisation.\nHowever, this does not protect against the case where a user defines a parameter to be an entire operation. e.g:\n[\nGetElements,\n\"${OPERATION}\"\n]\nIn this case any operation could be added at runtime.. Pretty much. It might just need some more unit testing to check it all works properly.. It would be helpful to have a javadoc explaining that this class has a main method and when it should be used \n. Perhaps All_Edges_Only should be No_Edges\n. Looks like your ide reformatted your comments here and formatted them strangely. Perhaps put the comment on 1 line or on the line before or as a javadoc\n. It might be better to throw an OperationException here. This also applies to the other accumulo operation handlers.\n. To be consistent with how we manage the other fields that cannot be modified, it might be better to allow setIncludeEntities to be called when includeEntities is false.\n. Could be private\n. could be private\n. I think this is method is missing the test annotation.\n. I don't think the parameter 'numEntries' is used in this method.\n. I think you can do: return null != n ? Iterables.limit(elements, n) : elements\n. There is now a UTF-8 constant in CommonUtils.CommonConstants\n. Should be changed to public\n. Should be changed to public\n. Should be changed to public\n. I don't think this function is needed\n. Please could you remove some of the unnecessary white space.\n. Missing copyright header\n. This seems to be being overridden by 'width: 60%' in print.css.\n. Method names should start with a lower case letter. If possible test methods should use the format 'shouldReturnXWhenY'.\n. It looks like these expected edges could still be final or constants?\n. This test option key isn't a property name, it looks like it is just used as an operation option key, so it shouldn't really be in the AccumuloPropertyNames constants class.\n. Please could you update the main .gitignore file for the repository instead of adding an extra spark/.gitignore file and then make sure your .settings, .project, .classpath and other local files are removed.\n. the parent version has now been updated to 0.3.6-SNAPSHOT\n. In Gaffer2 we refer to this 'rollUpOverTimeAndVisibility' as 'summarise'. This summarisation is now not limited to time and visibility, it will summarise over all properties that have been store in Accumulo's Key.\n. Instead of copying these files from the examples module, would it be possible to add a dependency on the example module in the pom and just reference them?\n. All .classpath files should be removed.\n. Add .classpath to .gitignore\n. All .project files should be removed.\n. All .settings/* files should be removed.\n. Do we need maven.compiler.source and maven.compiler.target properties? The gaffer parent pom sets the source and target java versions to 1.7 in the build plugin management section.\n. Can these test dependencies please be moved down to the other 'Test dependencies' section?\n. In the gaffer parent pom we include junit version 4.12 can we just use that instead? If so, this junit dependency can be removed.\n. In the gaffer parent pom we include maven surefire plugin version 2.19.1, via property \"surefire.plugin.version\". Can we use that instead?\n. Although the code does compile, I am getting errors in my IDE. We should probably be using accessor methods for these variables instead. \ne.g:\njava\nnew Pair<>(t._1(), t._2())\n. The Javadoc needs updating to make it specific to the 'ByteEntity' key package\n. Having these global fields methods the class is not thread safe. It is also a bit confusing that 'entity' is manipulated in the getSrcVertexFromKey method.\n. If possible, could we use constants instead of magic numbers. It would help to clarify why we need to add 2 to the position.\n. It would be slightly more efficient to return straight away if inSrc is true. That way we could skip calculating the inDst value.\n. We don't need the 'else' block here - it would be clearer without it. Similarly with the ClassicKeyBloomFilterIterator.\ne.g:\njava\nvertices.setFirst(Arrays.copyOf(key, pos));\nvertices.setSecond(Arrays.copyOfRange(key, pos + 3, key.length - 2));\nreturn vertices;\n. This could be made slightly more efficient if we do (sourceIsInCurrent && destMatchesClientFilter) check and if true we could skip the calculation for destIsInCurrent and sourceMatchesClientFilter.\nSimilarly with AccumuloIDWithinSetRetriever.\n. Very minor but AccumuloPropertyNames is not actually used in this test class.\n. Just for future reference, these tests don't need changing, we now have builders for edges and entities. So you can do the following:\njava\nfinal Edge expectedEdge = new Edge.Builder()\n    .source(\"1\").dest(\"2\").directed(true)\n    .property(AccumuloPropertyNames.COLUMN_QUALIFIER, 9)\n    .property(AccumuloPropertyNames.PROP_1, 0)\n    .property(AccumuloPropertyNames.PROP_2, 0)\n    .property(AccumuloPropertyNames.PROP_3, 0)\n    .property(AccumuloPropertyNames.PROP_4, 0)\n    .property(AccumuloPropertyNames.COUNT, 15)\n    .build();\n. Can these commented out lines be removed?\n. Would be better to use a logger or throw a StoreException\n. We have a VIEW and a SCHEMA key in AccumuloStoreConstants - perhaps we could reuse these?\n. These deserialise methods are used a lot, so we should minimise the number of objects we instantiate. Although it is more code, it might be better if \njava\ndeserialise(final byte[] bytes, final Class<T> clazz)\njust delegated directly to mapper.readValue(bytes, clazz);\n. this.get(key) could return null. \nWe should consider adding some protection around it. Also an extra unit test for the case when the current value is null would be good.\nPerhaps the following:\njava\nfinal Integer currentValue = get(key);\nif(null == currentValue) {\n    put(key, value)\n} else {\n    put(key, currentValue + value)\n}\n. The method name is actually \"is less than 2 or is more than 2\". \n. Should this be in the child classes? As it would be AccumuloStoreConstants.ELEMENT_POST_AGGREGATION_FILTER_ITERATOR_NAME for the post aggregation filter.\n. This javadoc and the one above should differentiate between pre and post aggregation.\n. The formatting for this looks a bit odd in a markdown viewer\n. FriendsWith isn't actually an Edge in the example schema. Perhaps it is worth just pointing this out.\n. Can we change this to ${project.parent.version} please.\n. Unnecessary javadoc\n. Good spot - thanks.\n. Looks like an incomplete sentence.\n. It would be more efficient to add a break when the first entry with assignable operation class is found.\nIf you need the last operation class then can you iterate through the operation scores in reverse order?\n. It would be simpler to have a single return statement. Perhaps we could change this to:\n``` java\nif (null == operationScore) {\n    LOGGER.warn(\"The operation '\" + operation.getClass().getName() + \"' was not found in the config file provided the configured default value of \" + DEFAULT_OPERATION_SCORE + \" will be used\");\n    operationScore = DEFAULT_OPERATION_SCORE;\n}\nreturn operationScore;\n```\n. A error message would be helpful, e.g. \"An operation class could not be found for operation score property \" + opClassName.\n. It might be clearer to call these properties: \"role max scores\" or \"max role scores\". Just to ensure they are understood to be max scores and not scores that will be incremented. \n. It's not really a problem but something to be aware of ... \nWhen elements are merged together if there is no timestamp property defined in the schema, accumulo will now override the accumulo timestamp column to the current time. \nIf there is no timestamp property, this column won't really be used by anything in gaffer, so it shouldn't be a problem  - but users may have custom code to use it.\n. This information is also on the wiki - can we just link to it instead?\n. These are actually defined in TestGroups in the common utils module (in the test code).\n. The \"count\" property is in defined in TestPropertyNames in the common utils module.\n. The visibility property could be any Object - it may not be a string, so unfortunately we can't default it to an empty string.\n. Perhaps store the response from serialiser.deserialiseEmptyBytes() so we don't have to call it twice.\n. These tests are really helpful and I think they would be useful for any Store implementation. Could we move them into the gaffer-integration-tests module and set the class to extend AbstractStoreIT. We could then reuse them for all Stores.\n. This would be better in the Properties class.\n. As we are making use of the maven dependency management section, we can remove the dependency versions from the other poms that use any of these dependencies.\nE.g in serialisation-library/pom.xml\nxml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.clearspring.analytics</groupId>\n    <artifactId>stream</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n. Can we not just remove these versions? As the version within the dependency management section in the parent pom should be automatically used.\n. @t616178 did you manage to make this change?\n. When elements are serialised into JSON they should always have the \"class\" property, so consumers of the API can check if the element is an Edge or an Entity. Why has it been removed from the JSON here?\n. I think we may need to back out the changes.\n. Please could you change this constant to be in uppercase for consistency - e.g TMP_DIRECTORY\nThis will be useful for other modules too, so it might be better in a CommonTestConstants class in the CommonUtil module.\n. It would be better to use the commons-lang.version property.\n. Can you add this new dependency to the NOTICES file please.\n. The first argument in an assertEquals should be the expected result. Please can we just change the order of these arguments.\n. I don't think this field is needed.. I think this should be null. In the serialise method, if the type value is blank an exception is thrown - so 'new TypeValue()' would not be able to be reserialised.. OK good spot.. Please could we move these tests into GetEdgesTest.java.. Please could we move these tests into GetElementsTest.java. Please could we move these tests into GetEntitiesTest.java. Please could we move these tests into GetEdgesTest.java. Please could we move these tests into GetElementsTest.java. Please could we move these tests into GetEntitiesTest.java. Perhaps do a quick global search for getElementsBySeed and replace it with getElements.. Perhaps we could merge GetElementsBySeedExample and GetRelatedElementsExample into GetElementsExample. Similarly with Entities and Edges.. even a null seed would actually be invalid.. In the quick profile - could we disable this build-extras profile?. Disabling build-extras should be part of the quick profile.. Please can you update the NOTICES file with these extra dependencies. As this name has changed you will need to make the following change to the gaffer.js file:\nin the addExampleButtons function, the id needs to be changed from 'resource_graphdoOperation' to 'resource_operations'. Please can you make sure the NOTICES file is updated to include any new dependencies and these new versions.. Being able to register specific resources is important so any implementation/extensions can remove/override particular resources. Can we add the 'addServices' 'addSystemResources' methods back in?. As graph/doOperation has been renamed to 'operations' you will need to update gaffer.js so that the addExampleButtons method finds the swagger sections properly.\nIn gaffer.js/addExampleButtons method - change 'resource_graphdoOperation' to 'resource_operations'. Please can you also add an example for this executeChunked method into 'SimpleExamplesService.java'. Shouldn't need to create a new mapper every time.. This is going to load all the results into memory. It would be better if we could lazily add them to the chunked output.. This method doesn't seem to work in swagger. I added some elements then tried the following:\njson\n{\n  \"operations\": [\n    {\n      \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements\"\n    }\n  ]\n}. Perhaps this should be:\n\"To use Gaffer on Accumulo the only required dependency is the accumulo-store dependency:\". Perhaps we could put a link to: https://mvnrepository.com/search?q=uk.gov.gchq.gaffer. I realise the reason for changing it from EXTERNAL_PROPERTY, as EXTERNAL_PROPERTY doesn't work with databind in the older version of jackson.\nHowever, changing to PROPERTY may cause duplicate \"class\" fields in the JSON.\nDue to serialising and deserialising generic types we had an issue where the \"class\" field was being completely missed off. To ensure it is always present we added a getter and setter for \"class\". The EXISTING_PROPERTY annotation then just relies on the getter and setter being used.. Using this version is now not compatible with the version of scala/spark - this exception is thrown:\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Jackson version is too old 2.3.1\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.module.scala.JacksonModule$class.setupModule(JacksonModule.scala:56)\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.module.scala.DefaultScalaModule.setupModule(DefaultScalaModule.scala:19)\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.registerModule(ObjectMapper.java:537)\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDDOperationScope$.(RDDOperationScope.scala:82)\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDDOperationScope$.(RDDOperationScope.scala)\n    ... 37 more. I don't think REST API methods should return generic types - you get warnings when the REST API starts up if any are methods that return a generic type.. I'll move them out into a separate class so they can be reused a bit more easily.. I'm not sure. We could throw a different exception or provide some contextual information about why it was a 400/500. What do you think?. It would be useful to state that you also added entities at the source of each edge. As the edge is not directed should you also add an entity at the destination of each edge?. I think this should be ${GET_ENTITIES}. I think it is useful - it is just a shortcut for new Builder().merge(schema)\nAllows users to start from a existing schema and make change.. I think it is useful - it is just a shortcut for new Builder().merge(view)\nAllows users to start from a existing view and make changes.. Thanks - I'll update the getting started guide with an example.. I think it should be the same annotation as seeds in AbstractGetOperation:\n@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = \"class\")\n. If possible we should clone the input instance like we do with other aggregators (e.g SetAggregator). We don't need to use the fully qualified class name here.. By having to register this in the ApplicationConfig anyone wanting to register a different User or Graph Factory, they will need to override this application config class, remove FactoriesBinder and add their own FactoriesBinder class. It seems like a lot more code than what they currently have to do. Currently users can just set the property class name for the factories.. Please could you add a javadoc to say this class has been copied?. and Graph. See gh-755 - perhaps we could fix that bug at the same time?. This check should be before: connector.tableOperations().exists(tableName). I tend to not use that annotation as it will only check that somewhere in the test method an exception is thrown. Using try/catch allows you to test a precise method throws an exception and to validate the exception has the correct message.. You shouldn't need to wrap this in a closable iterable.. If possible we should avoid bringing all the elements into memory. You should be able to do this lazily as the iterable is consumed.. We should avoid bringing all the elements into memory. We should be able to process the iterable lazily as it is consumed.. It was added to mirror the SingleUseAccumuloStore. I suppose it is possible that a user wants the table to be deleted every time a new Graph is initialised, seems unusual but lets leave it here for the time being.. I don't think this import is required.. If possible a simple test for this would be good.. Please can you update the Datasketches version in the NOTICES file.. It probably won't work - this also applies to the Accumulo Store. The OPERATION_RETURN_MATCHED_SEEDS_AS_EDGE_SOURCE is actually quite a nice feature, it would be a shame to lose it. I've added a comment to the other pull request (https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/835). If this throws an exception then you need to ensure the rtn InputStreams are closed.. Perhaps remove these methods and just have the methods that take a URL. This method could be confused with the open stream from path.. Perhaps rename this to CacheServiceImpl or EmptyCacheService. It isn't really a mock.. I think you would be safer catching all throwable objects here. I think you would be safer catching all throwable objects here.. Just need to close the input streams in a finally block.. Remove todo.. Don't think we need the isLogging parameter.. The cache service should not depend on java.servlet. It should work without the REST API. I think the CacheServiceLoader should be triggered by the initialise method in the Store class, not a web listener.\nThis will then mean the CacheService interfaces will need to be moved into the Store module.. See other comment about removing this web listener and having it triggered by initialising a Gaffer Store.. This should come from a StoreProperty not system property so it works without a REST API.. I know there are a lot of changes in version 0.7.0 already, but that could be quite an annoying breaking change. It makes this tidier but doesn't really give any benefit. Perhaps something we think about doing at a later date.. We need to ensure the operation inputs are always closed when any exception is thrown, otherwise we risk leaving connections to accumulo/hbase open.. All operation implementations must be able to close all closable fields it has. But just to simplify things for simple operations I added the default method here to avoid having to duplicate the empty implementation.. I'll add a javadoc. I'm not sure what the best solution is. As it is all operations are closeable and users can chose to override the close method.\nIt also does make sense for an operation implementation to chose whether to implement closable or not and add \"implements Closeable\". \nI think making all operations implement closeable will encourage more users to think about adding a custom implementation of close.\nIt also means in OperationChain.close I can just iterate round all operations and call close. Alternatively I would need to do instanceof and then cast to Closeable for each operation. . Yeah that would be useful. Not sure the best way to share that standard though. We can add notes to the ways of working wiki page. But better would be to share settings files for intellij/eclipse etc.. Good spot, thanks. I've removed it.. A javadoc for this class would be really useful as it is a key part of Gaffer.. should say: byte[] the serialised bytes. This should be Serialiser. This should be Serialiser. This should be Serialiser.. This should be Serialiser.. This should be Serialiser.. This should be Serialiser.. All references to ToBytesSerialiser in this class should be Serialiser. In fact all references to ToBytesSerialiser in the entire Store module should be Serialiser. ToBytesSerialiser should only be required in the Accumulo and HBase stores.. This should be Serialiser.. Is there a reason for using the Canonical name here? Everywhere else we just use getName() or for a short version just getSimpleName(). I don't really understand what the point of this class is? Can you just use one of the other Serialisers we already have?. At this point no serialisers should be null. If they are then we should add an error to the validation result. E.g:\n```java\nif(null == serialisation) {\n    validationResult.addError(\"Serialiser for \" + propertyName + \" in group \" + entrySet.getKey() \" is null. A default serialiser could not be found so you must specify your own serialiser class\");\n} else if(!(serialisation instanceof ToBytesSerialiser)) {\n    validationResult.addError(\n            String.format(SCHEMA_SERIALISER_S_FOR_PROPERTY_S_IN_THE_GROUP_S_IS_NOT_INSTANCE_OF_S,\n                    serialisation.getClass().getName(),\n                    propertyName,\n                    entrySet.getKey(),\n                    ToBytesSerialiser.class.getCanonicalName()));\n}\n```. As a large number of properties may use the same 'type' so you might end up checking the same type serialiser multiple times.\nRather than iterating around all the properties it would be more efficient to iterate around the schema 'types'. \nE.g:\njava\ngetSchema().getTypes().entrySet(). In addition to checking the property/type serialisers please can you also check the vertexSerialiser.\ne.g:\njava\nif (!(getSchema().getVertexSerialiser() instanceof ToBytesSerialiser)) {\n    // add error\n}. This validation logic should also be updated in the HBase store. \nYou could add the logic to the Store class instead with a method similar to:\njava\nprotected ValidationResult validateSerialiserClasses(final Class<? extends Serialiser> requiredParentSerialiserClass) {\n}\nThen both the HBaseStore and AccumuloStore classes could call this method.. I think this can be replaced with StringToStringSerialiser.. This should be removed.. Sorry to be picky but please could this method go further down the class with the other protected methods. It is nice to have the initialise method first. Similarly in the other store implementations.\nAlso you could change the return type to Class<? extends ToBytesSerialiser> . If value is null then we should use serialiser.serialiseNull(). To reduce the migration for users, please can we keep this as 'dest'. You should be able to add a JsonProperty annotation on to tell jackson it is called 'destination'. Everything in example/gettingstarted has been moved to the doc module.. OK, we can have that discussion in a separate issue and do that migration separately if needed.. Please can we keep these methods as protected. This class can be extended so it would be useful to allow child classes to be able to call these methods if they need to.. We use the name 'lastDelimiter' in a few places and I'm not sure the word 'carriage' is actually any better, so please could we keep it as 'lastDelimiter'.. could currentPropLength be final?. typo with getDesialisedObject. Please could you add a quick javadoc and unit test for this method/class. Please could you add a unit test for this.. instead of this you can do:\njava\nfinal Graph graph = new Graph.Builder()\n                .addSchemas(StreamUtil.schemas(getClass()))\n                .storeProperties(StreamUtil.storeProps(getClass()))\n                .build();\nThis will load all schemas in from resource folder /schema   and load the store properties from a resource file /store.properties.. Please could you add a unit test for this method.. Please can this method also be left as protected.. Minor issue but if possible please could you move these 2 private methods to the bottom of the class.. Although it is neater to use the expected exception annotation it means the unit test will pass if an illegal argument exception is thrown from anywhere in the test. We only want the test to pass if the exception is thrown when graph.execute is called. For that reason I tend to use try/catch to ensure I am definitely testing the exception is thrown in the right place. E.g:\ntry {\n    graph1.execute(rddQuery, user);\n    fail(\"Exception expected\");\n} catch(final IllegalArgumentException e) {\n    assertNotNull(e.getMessage());\n}. Could this be converted into a test with assertions?. Instead of having to add this extra method and the extra optimiseSchema method, it would be neater to just override the createSchemaOptimiser() method in the AccumuloStore class:\njava\nprotected SchemaOptimiser createSchemaOptimiser() {\n          return new SchemaOptimiser(new AccumuloSerialisationFactory());\n}. If you made this a List you wouldn't need your serialiserAlreadyinList method. You could just do CORE_SERIALISERS.contains(serialiser). Argh - ignore that comment as the serialiser implementations don't have hashcode/equals methods so it wouldn't work.. Please can you update the notices file with the updated spark version.. Please can you add a javadoc. Please could you follow the standards for equals and hashCodes throughout the rest of the project - using org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.EqualsBuilder and org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder.. You can remove the dependencies on data, serialisation, store and operation as they are all part of graph.\n. Please could you define your traits like we do in the accumulo store:\npublic static final Set TRAITS =\n            Collections.unmodifiableSet(Sets.newHashSet(\n                    ORDERED,\n                    VISIBILITY,\n                    INGEST_AGGREGATION,\n                    QUERY_AGGREGATION,\n                    PRE_AGGREGATION_FILTERING,\n                    POST_AGGREGATION_FILTERING,\n                    POST_TRANSFORMATION_FILTERING,\n                    TRANSFORMATION,\n                    STORE_VALIDATION\n            ));\ni.e wrap them in an unmodifiable set.. Please can we remove these constructors for consistency with other stores as they aren't really required. Users should be using a Graph instance which will automatically call the initialise method.. The SerialisationFactory has been updating since you wrote this class. There is now a constructor that takes an array of serialisers. Then you can remove the getSerialiser method. . this is initialised in the initialise method so you shouldn't need to do the null check. could you initialise this in the initialise method instead?. perhaps this could be refactored to something like:\nfinal SparkUser sparkUser;\nif (user instanceof SparkUser) {\nsparkUser = (SparkUser) user;\n...\n} else {\n...\nsparkUser = new SparkUser(user, spark);\n}\nreturn sparkUser;. You could rename this to just GetAdjacentIdsHandler.. Either add a javadoc or remove this empty comment.. Either add a javadoc or delete the empty comment. Also check other files for this same issue.. I think you could get concurrent modification exceptions with this groupToIndex map. An alternative might be to instead of clearing the map, to create a new map then assign the new map to groupToIndex at the end of the method.. I'm concerned that this latestSnapshot variable could be modified in a different thread whilst you are using it here.. Arrays.toString will be called every time whether or not debug mode is enabled. Probably best to just delete these log statements.. Please could you use try-with-resources to ensure the reader is always closed.. When doing .equals it is good practice to put the constant first, then if the variable is null it won't throw a null pointer exception.. you could either your CommonConstants.UTF_8 or gaffer's StringUtil.toString(colType).. Please can you change the return type to List.. Please can you change the return type to Map.. Bit picky but perhaps put this log statement after the directory has actually been deleted.. Could you use a property here instead of the magic string 200?. I don't think this store.optimiseSchema should be here. It will be called automatically for you in the Store class when the store is initialised.. Perhaps create a ParquetUtil class and add this configureSpark into there. It looks similar to the configureSpark in AddElementsFromRDDHandler.. You can use gaffer's CloseableUtil.close(inputIter). FileSystem is closeable - it should really be used in a try-with-resources block to ensure it is always closed. Please can you check all of your code for this issue.. Perhaps split the method into a couple of smaller methods.. Remove this if it is no longer needed.. Minor issue but this method should be renamed to buildColumnToAggregatorMap. Would it be possible to reuse this thread pool each time this is constructed? Otherwise, we should probably shutdown the thread pool after it is used.. Could we move some of this logic into a method or move it into a util class? It seems odd having a class that just has a constructor.. use a try-with-resources block to close this.. Please could you create a constant for \"sorted\". See other note about thread pools. You could just refer to these as Maps instead of HashMaps. I think this logic should really go in OperationChainValidator and look at the store traits to validate all operation views. . this close method should probably could close fs and also any iterators that are open - have a look at AccumuloItemRetriever and AccumuloRetriever for an example.. It is probably cheaper to do this.currentPath.toString().contains(\"reverseEdges\") so put that first in the if statement.. could getNextElement() return an element with a different group? If so, you will need to get the preAggregationFilter again.. Please could you rename this to ParquetConstants otherwise it could get confusing with CommonConstants, AccumuloStoreConstants etc.. typo - recursively. path.indexOf(\".\") is done twice here. Might be worth storing it in a variable.. You could just do:\njava\nreturn new Object[]{object};. Arrays.toString will be called overtime even if in debug mode.. change this to: LOGGER.debug(\"GroupByColumns: {}\", this.groupByColumns);. also change this to:\nLOGGER.debug(\"PropertyToAggregatorMap: {}\", this.propertyToAggregatorMap);\nPlease could you go through your code and change for this sort of issue.. again:\nLOGGER.trace(\"First Row object to be aggregated: {}\",  v1);. Instead of .toString(), it is safer to use .name() as toString could be overridden to return something different.. Please can you change the parameter types to be Map instead HashMap and also check for this issue in your other changes.. It is probably more efficient to do:\njava\nCollections.addAll(this.groupByColumns, paths);. You could optimise this by not creating the HashSet unless you actually need it.\nIn the case the groupBy is null you could return Collections.emptySet();\nWhen you create the HashSet you can create it using the size of the groupBy set.. Perhaps change the name of the method to createGroupByFunction so user's are more aware that it is doing some work and creating a new instance of the function each time.. The key should also include the Element identifiers (SOURCE, DESTINATION, DIRECTED, VERTEX) and the element group. These are all the things that make up the element key.. Please can you tell your IDE to not change this indenting? Also occurred in the SchemaTest file.. Please can you add a unit test to SchemaElementDefinitionValidatorTest to test this logic.. Oh, I've just been thinking about this a bit more and we can't just use a Set as the key as we lose the context as to what things are in the key. For example:\nif Entity 1 = {\ngroup: \"Red\"\nvertex: \"1\"\nproperties: {}\n}\nEntity2 = {\ngroup: \"1\"\nvertex: \"Red\"\nproperties: {}\n}\nThese entities are different but when Red and 1 are put in the Set they would have the same key.\nInstead of using a Set perhaps we should just use the Element class.\nFor example, something like:\n```java\npublic Function toElementKey(final Schema schema) {\n        return element -> {\n            final Element key = element.emptyClone();\n            final SchemaElementDefinition elDef = schema.getElement(key.getGroup());\n            if (elDef == null) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(\"received element \" + element + \" which belongs to a \" +\n                        \"group not found in the schema\");\n            }\n        final Set<String> groupBy = elDef.getGroupBy();\n        for (final String property : groupBy) {\n            key.putProperty(property, element.getProperty(property));\n        }\n        return key;\n    };\n}\n\n```. I think you need to add BoundedTimestampSet.class to this list too.. This class is not json serialisable. To enable it to be used over the rest api, it needs to be json serialisable, i.e add a default constructor, getters and setters.\nPerhaps add a simple test like this:\n```java\n    @Test\n    public void shouldSerialiseAndDeserialise() throws SerialisationException {\n        // Given\n        final JSONSerialiser serialiser = new JSONSerialiser();\n        final BoundedTimestampSet boundedTimestampSet = new BoundedTimestampSet(CommonTimeUtil.TimeBucket.SECOND, 10);\n        IntStream.range(0, 20)\n                .forEach(i -> {\n                    boundedTimestampSet.add(Instant.ofEpochMilli(i * 1000L));\n                    if (i <= 9) {\n                        assertEquals(BoundedTimestampSet.State.NOT_FULL, boundedTimestampSet.getState());\n                    } else {\n                        assertEquals(BoundedTimestampSet.State.SAMPLE, boundedTimestampSet.getState());\n                    }\n                });\n    // When\n    byte[] json = serialiser.serialise(boundedTimestampSet, true);\n    final BoundedTimestampSet deserialisedObj = serialiser.deserialise(json, BoundedTimestampSet.class);\n\n    // Then\n    assertEquals(boundedTimestampSet, deserialisedObj);\n}\n\n```. This class is also not json serialisable. See comment on BoundedTimestampSet.. Perhaps add a link in these deprecated messages to the new classes.. Please can we not rely on the current time. Just use new Date(10000L) or something similar. Also it would be good to check a few dates perhaps in a for loop to check a range of dates are ordered correctly.. Please can you add a test for ordering.. Please can you add a test for ordering.. Please can you add a test for ordering.. Please can you add a test for ordering.. Please could you order these new serialisers so that the most commonly used serialisers occur at the top. A minor issue but it will be slightly faster. I would imagine that would be something like:\nnew OrderedRawLongSerialiser(),\nnew OrderedRawDateSerialiser(),\nnew OrderedRawIntegerSerialiser(),\nnew OrderedRawDoubleSerialiser(),\nnew OrderedRawFloatSerialiser()\n. Good question. Both are a complex, so I don't think it is worth making the change.. Please could you update the class javadoc too, to include some information on how the different flags work together.. For example, explaining what SeedMatchingType EQUALS and RELATED.\nSome quick notes:\n * An Entity is RELATED to an EntityId if the Entity's vertex is equal to the EntityId vertex\n * An Entity is RELATED to an EdgeId if either the Entity's vertex is equal to either the EdgeId's source or destination\n * An Edge is RELATED to an EntityId if either the Edge's source or destination matches the EntityId's vertex\n * An Edge is RELATED to an EdgeId if the Edge's source, destination and directed values are equal to the EdgeId. Note that the EdgeId directed value could be EITHER, this will mean Edges that are DIRECTED OR UNDIRECTED will be matched.\n. Please can you also update the vertexSerialiserClass getter/setter in Schema.java.. This class needs to be merged with LengthValueBytesSerialiserUtil.java. Either uncomment or delete this.. We shouldn't be looking up the system property every time this method is called. This logic should go in the updateDebugMode.\nPerhaps rename this method to isInDebugMode(). If isDebug is null then call updateDebugMode.\nThen create a isInDebugMode getter that just returns\n. Just leave this as toString().. Just leave this as toString().. Just leave this as toString().. I imagined:\n```java\npublic static Boolean isDebug;\npublic static void isInDebugMode() {\n    if(null == isDebug) {\n        updateDebugMode();\n    }\nreturn isDebug;\n\n}\n```\nEvery time toString is called on an object this method will be called - so that could be a lot. The value of the system property should never really change and if a user decides to change the system property value then it is easy enough for them to call updateDebugMode at the same time. You could have another method - setDebugMode() that sets the system property and updates the isDebug value.. I added these in when I was investigating MapDB and Hazelcast implementations, probably don't really need them.. OK I'll make that change.. Can you remove this carriage++ comment?. I'm not sure about these casting changes in these files. Can we leave it as it was?. I made the change to make the maps a bit smaller. This will reduce the number of hashcode collisions and should make it a bit faster. The Outer map is always a HashMap containing probably only a small number of groups so that initial look up will be very fast. In the future we could then optimise some of the queries to only look in the maps for the groups requested. . Perhaps just put a comment explaining that instead.. This is very similar to ReservoirLongsSketchSerialiser and ReservoirNumberSketchSerialiser. It would save a fair bit of duplication if we had a ReservoirItemsSketchSerialiser that had a constructor:\njava\npublic ReservoirItemsSketchSerialiser(final ArrayOfItemsSerDe<T> arraySerialiser) {\nthis.arraySerialiser = arraySerialiser;\n}\nThen this ReservoirStringsSketchSerialiser would just extend  ReservoirItemsSketchSerialiser and look like:\njava\npublic class ReservoirStringsSketchSerialiser extends ReservoirItemsSketchSerialiser<String> {\n    public ReservoirStringsSketchSerialiser() {\n        super(new ArrayOfNumbersSerDe());\n    }\n}. Is it worth adding another walkthrough for the doc module for HllpUnion, similar to UnionSketch.java? Otherwise these serialisers and aggregators may just get lost and forgotten about.. This will avoid making a breaking change and give users some time to make changes to their code whilst the table name property is deprecated. When we remove the table name altogether in a later version we will remove this too.. You will need to put a null check in to check the file getPropertiesPath(propertiesId) actually exists and has properties in. A user could provide any propertiesId they want and it might not exist.. schemaId and propertiesId could be the same. So you will need to add a suffix/prefix onto the path like with getGraphsPath - it adds \"Graphs\" onto the end of the file name.. I think the properties file created will actually be a .properties file not .json.. Please can you add a test for when the graphId, schemaId and propertiesId are all the same value.. Please can you add a test for when the schema is null or the store properties are null for a given id.. The pathToFileGraphLibrary is not a required argument. As you mention in the javadoc if it is not provided then NoGraphLibrary will be used instead. Therefore you should set the NUM_REQUIRED_ARGS to 4. Same for HBase.. We should call addOrUpdate as we want to update the schema and store properties. Similarly for HBase.. You should check the length of args here. If args.length < 4 then return null;\nSimilarly for Accumulo but < 5.. Perhaps this should be named getOperationChainAsJsonNode.. Please could you add a unit test for this.. Please could you add a unit test for this.. Same as above - the method needs to be private and the swapVertices needs access to set the values of source/destination/matchedVertex.. The method needs to be private and the swapVertices needs access to set the values of source/destination/matchedVertex.. OK good idea, I've moved it into the data module.. If before is empty then the originalOp would never be added. If before contains multiple operations then the original operation is added multiple times.. if before or after is null you will get a null pointer. Please could you write a few more tests to check different combinations of values. Like null values or empty values.. Users should not be given access to the underlying store.. We should expose an addSchema(String schemaId, Schema schema) method instead of this method that takes bytes.. If these methods are now public we will need to validate the ids.. Please could we add some more examples to show the different ways you can export - using parent ids etc.. Please could you add a javadoc to explain what T and U are?. We shouldn't need to expose these store properties.. I don't think this should be a public method. Everything should be set in the Graph Builder.. Please could we add another example showing how we can use a ProxyStore to export to a different rest api?. It is unlikely to be null, but if a Store implementation overrides it, it could be. Perhaps just leave this in just in case. Please can you update your comment?. please can you rename this to graphLibrary as it is a bit confusing to have it called storeLibrary.. Please can you either fix this or delete the comment?. please can you either fix this or delete the comment?. I think it would actually be nicer if this field was called storeProperties in the json.\nPlease can you add @JsonGetter(\"storeProperties\") to this getter and @JsonSetter(\"storeProperties\") annotation to the setProperties method.. Please can you put all the constructors together at the top of the class (below the fields).. Can you remove the getter/setter and make this final?. newOpChain could just be a List of Operation and then you could change the return type to be List of Operation.. This could be a List of Operation.. This line doesn't do anything. It should be removed.. I think these null checks could go in the setters in the AdditionalOperations class instead. . Please can you put the getters/setters at the bottom of the public methods. The important methods should go first, i.e. preExecute and postExecute. Again, perhaps you could move the null checks into the setter.. I don't think we need this file. We should be able to refer to ExportToOtherGraphOperationDeclarations.json instead in these properties: example/road-traffic/road-traffic-demo/src/main/resources/mockaccumulo.properties. I don't think we really need some of these variables. Then you can just pass the export operation to the methods instead of passing so many variables around.. I think we can probably just merge this validationHandling into logic into the validate method and make the validate method private.. perhaps call the methods createGraphX instead of getGraphX. It would be better to use a temporary folder:\njava\n@Rule\npublic final TemporaryFolder testFolder = new TemporaryFolder(CommonTestConstants.TMP_DIRECTORY);\njunit will also delete it for you after the test.. Each test. The tests should be written so they pass independent of what order they are run in.. If hasNext is false then we don't actually need to call iterator.hasNext(). Calling iterator.hasNext() could mean loading the next batch from accumulo and could be expensive. . Please could you add the 'end' field to the error message so users know what limit was hit.. Please could you rename this hasNext variable to withinLimit or something similar.. This could be a boolean instead of Boolean. Then in the handler you don't need to do the null check.. Please could you add another test, when limit is equal to the length of the iterable and truncate is false.. No, I think once the ElementAggregator is locked - no changes should be allowed. If you need to make changes then you should create a new instance of ElementAggregator.. Those 2 methods takes collection, collection. We need to ones that works with an array. I could do Arrays.asList(array) and then use those methods but it seemed wasteful to create an extra object. What do you think?\n. Good idea. I've created a separate issue to do it: #1098.. The default should probably still be false.. Please can we leave this formatting as it was? It would help the review have less changes and I think it looks neater having each method call on a new line.. Why are we allowing the start field to be null?. Going backwards in the jersey version? We would need to also update the NOTICES file.. We should add a migration note to the issue to say that if you had previously extended ApplicationConfig to add custom config then you will now have to extend ApplicationConfigV1 and ApplicationConfigV2. Can we make that any easier for users?. Do we need this code? Also some code commented out below.. This needs to use the Edge Builder.. this could be 'protected static final'. Please can you put constants above the other fields.. Do you have to use a Tuple2, can you use a Pair instead as it will be less expensive.. \"This method this method\" typo. Perhaps split this into smaller methods.. Rather than hardcoding BasicEntity there is a constant TestGroups.ENTITY that equals \"BasicEntity\". You could load the Schema like this:\nschema = Schema.fromJson(StreamUtil.schemas(ConvertViewToFilterTest.class, \"schemaUsingTypeValueVertexType\"));. This should be \"else if\" as if graphLibrary is null then currently you would get a null pointer exception here.. We need to do all the authorisation first. If a user is not allow to export to graph1 then we should not attempt to load graph1 from the graphLibrary. This also applied to checking the user is authorised to use the schema ids and properties id.. Please can we make this a list of parent schema ids like we have in ExportToOtherGraph.. This should not be in src/main\nIt is only example configuration, users will need to create their own version of this file with their own authorisations.. Users will need to write their own json file first.. This should be:\npublic static final String GRAPH_LIBRARY_CLASS = \"gaffer.graph.library.class\";\npublic static final String GRAPH_LIBRARY_CONFIG = \"gaffer.graph.library.config\";\nThen users can choose what graph library they want to use.\nWe could then load it using something like:\njava\nString graphLibraryClassName = System.getProperty(SystemProperty.GRAPH_LIBRARY_CLASS);\nif(null != graphLibraryClassName) {\n    GraphLibrary library = null;\n    try {\n        library = Class.forName(graphLibraryClassName).asSubClass(GraphLibrary.class).newInstance();\n    } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Unknown GraphLibrary class: + \" + graphLibraryClassName);\n    }\n    library.initialise(System.getProperty(SystemProperty.GRAPH_LIBRARY_CONFIG));\n}. See comment above.. I don't think the graphLibrary directory should be committed.. the path should be ${project.build.outputDirectory}/graphLibrary. Don't reference the FileGraphLibrary here as there could be other libraries in the future. Change the comment to:\n// Do nothing.. Change to just:\n// Do nothing.. This system property needs updating to use the new gaffer.graph.library.class and gaffer.graph.library.config properties.. Javadoc needs updating. It still refers to 'Max'.. just use:\nreturn Lists.newArrayList(objectsToDeserialise);. just use:\nreturn Sets.newHashSet(objectsToDeserialise);. Could you remove the instanceof checks and just do:\nreturn new TypeSubTypeValue(objects[0].toString(), objects[1].toString(), objects[2].toString());. You can change it to 2016-2017. Do  you need to add this dependency, it should be included in the bitmap-library dependency.. I think there are a few more things you need to include here (as specified in the issue):\norg.roaringbitmap:RoaringBitmap\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer:bitmap-library\nuk.gov.gchq.gaffer:sketches-library\nOnce the shaded jar is compiled, please could you look at what is included and check it contains all the required dependencies for this time library.. To help with the formatting you can tell markdown the type of code block like this:\nxml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.gaffer</groupId>\n    <artifactId>proxy-store</artifactId>\n    <version>${project.parent.version}</version>\n </dependency>\n. I don't think this dependency is actually required.. set the markdown code block type to properties. set the markdown code block type to json. set the markdown code block type to xml. set the markdown code block type to xml. set the markdown code block type to json. I think we could actually demonstrate the export using just a single instance of accumulo and just export to a different Accumulo table (using a different graphId but the same properties and schema).. Please could you add a sub heading, similar to the FAQs in core/operation/README.md.\nFAQs\nHere are some frequently asked questions.\nHow can I run an example of the authorised Graph exporter?\nTo use an example of the authorised Graph exporter within the road-traffic-demo using the proxy-store, follow these steps.\netc.. Why is this now Integer? Does it need to be nullable?. The graph will deal with that - it will attempt to get it from a provided store and if it is still null it will throw an exception.. Good spot, I've changed it back to Collections.singletonList.. I have now deprecated that method too.. I don't think we need the hyperloglogplus at the end of the package name.. should be opChain. perhaps rename the operation parameter back to opChain. the auths field could also be final. Rename the operation parameter back to opChain.. Again, please can you renamed the operation parameter back to opChain.. Do we need to change the OperationChain parameter to Operation? If possible we should leave it as OperationChain. Otherwise we would need to change the opChain field to operation. Then any previous job details stored in the cache would probably become invalid as they won't be able to be deserialised.. Do we need this bit:\n include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = \"class\"\ncan it just be:\n@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NONE). this should just return null to avoid it being added to the json.. Oh, it looks like this is going to require a migration for any existing named operations. Could we use something like the OperationChainDAO here instead, so the class name isn't required?. This method is no longer called from anywhere. Perhaps the proxy store could just override the handler for OperationChainHandler instead.. Can this be removed now as it is in the OperationChainHandler class instead?. I think you need some additional logic in here. If op is instance of OperationChain, you should check if the first operation in the operation chain is instance of input and set the input if required.\nPlease could you also add some more tests to check nested operation chains are handled correctly.. Please could you add some tests to check nested operations are handled correctly.. Please could you add some tests to check nested operations are handled correctly.. Please could you add some tests to check nested operations are handled correctly.. Thanks, I've added some now.. View, GraphHooks and GraphLibrary don't implement equals so having a GraphConfig.equals method doesn't really work.. Please can you update the return type to be ExportToOtherAuthorisedGraph. Similarly with the other operations.. For all these tests please can you also add:\nassertNotSame(op, clone);\nThis will check that the instance is actually different.. This method should be deleted. It is not used and we don't actually want to validate the property values.\nAfter this method is deleted you could merge validateValue and validate methods.\nPerhaps rename the method to validateName. Why do we need the null check? A null property name should be invalid too.. Perhaps rename the method to validateName. Please could you add unit tests for this class.. Please could you add unit tests for this class.. You can simplify this line to:\njava\nelDef.getProperties().forEach(PropertiesUtil::validate);. You can simplify these lines to:\njava\ngetThisSchema().getGroups().forEach(GroupUtil::validate);\ngetThisSchema().getEntityGroups().forEach(GroupUtil::validate);. Please could you update the error message to:\n\"Serialiser for groupBy property \" + property + \" is inconsistent. This store requires all groupBy property serialisers to be consistent.\". Please could you update the error message to:\n\"Vertex serialiser is inconsistent. This store requires vertices to be serialised in a consistent way.\". So it looks like Accumulo, HBase and Parquet stores all have this same validation. Perhaps you could create 2 methods in Store with this logic.\nvalidateConsistentVertex and validateConsistentGroupByProperties.\nThen in the store implementations we can just call those 2 methods.. This should actually be:\nreturn null != vertexSerialiser && vertexSerialiser.isConsistent();. Please could you also update this to:\nreturn null != vertexSerialiser && vertexSerialiser.preservesObjectOrdering();. this should be false. This should actually be:\nreturn null != vertexSerialiser && vertexSerialiser.isConsistent();. Please could you change this to:\nreturn null != vertexSerialiser && vertexSerialiser.preservesObjectOrdering();. this should be false. Please could you change this to:\nreturn null != vertexSerialiser && vertexSerialiser.preservesObjectOrdering();. This should be false.. This should be false.. This should be false.. This should be false.. This should be false.. This should be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should probably be false.. This should be false.. This should probably be false.. Might be worth leaving this bit in for a bit longer as it was only recently deprecated. . You need to add a null check for operation.getOption(\"gaffer.operation.graphids\"). Please could you make gaffer.operation.graphIds a constant and put it in a class FederatedStoreConstants. Requiring the operation chain class name in this json shouldn't really be required. Is there anyway we an add this in for users or use the OperationChainDAO object instead? Otherwise any existing named operations that are stored in the JCS cache will need to be updated.. Don't really need this space.. See above comment about the operation chain class name.. If deserialisedOp.getStart() is null you will end up with a null pointer exception here instead of a nice error message making it more difficult to debug.. Please can you update the NOTICES file.. Perhaps we could have a constant at the top of this file for the version \"v1\". Similarly in ApplicationConfigV2 . Might be useful to have a description in the Api annotation. Same applies to the other service classes.. Don't think we need this new line.. If this is not required then delete it.. Perhaps we could make constants for these error codes and messages?\nE.g\npublic static final int NOT_FOUND_CODE = 404;\npublic static final int NOT_FOUND_MSG_SUFFIX = \" not found.\";\npublic static final int INTERNAL_ERROR_CODE = 500;\npublic static final int INTERNAL_ERROR_MSG = \"Something went wrong in the server\";\nSimilarly in the other files.. It is an implementation of IStatusServiceV2. If this is not needed then can we delete it?. Can this be deleted?. I'm assuming the proxy store won't work if given /rest/v1? If it now requires a rest api version 2 then we will need to change this context root to just /rest and automatically append v2 to the end.. EntryToElement implements serializable, but if it is actually ever serialised it will break as both converter and view are transient. Do you need a way to reconstruct these transient fields? Perhaps store the serialisedConf as a field and then you can reconstruct the transient fields.. This doesn't look like it applies post transform filtering? Can we added that in?. Do you need to check for deletions?\nFrom the SortedKeyValueIterator javadoc:\nNote that in minor compaction scope and in non-full major compaction scopes the iterator may see deletion entries.\n. you could just do: \njava\nBoolean.parseBoolean(useRFileReaderRDD). Please could you update the GetJavaRDDOfAllElementsExample to tell users about this magic option?. Please could you do this in a try-with-resources to ensure baos is always closed even if there is an exception. Similarly in deserialiseConfiguration.. Please can you rename split to graphIds.. OK fair enough, if it is a big change just create a separate issue for and it and we can do it later.. If this is called in the middle of building a Graph it could cause problems with the updateSchema method and configBuilder.build(). I don't think we need this method here.. Please could this just say \"The Gaffer REST service\"  or perhaps we don't need the description.. needs to be lower case 'wiki' for the url.. It would be nice if this accepted Operation not just OperationChain.. It would be more helpful to return a chain of GetAllElements, Limit(1). can this just stay as 'load' instead of 'Load'?. I don't think we will remember to keep this list up to date. So perhaps generate this list using reflection - anything that is an instance of Operation.. Do we need this class name?. I don't think we need this end point. It just duplicates the POST at /graph/operations with an extra path param that isn't actually used.. should be \"Schema & Properties are not required\". StoreProperties are not guaranteed to be json serialisable. So please could you add these 2 methods in to get it working in JSON correctly:\n```java\n@JsonGetter(\"storeProperties\")\npublic Properties getProperties() {\n    return storeProperties.getProperties();\n}\n@JsonSetter(\"storeProperties\")\npublic void setProperties(final Properties properties) {\n    setStoreProperties(StoreProperties.loadStoreProperties(properties));\n}\n```. missing $ before {removeGraphJson}. Remove this buffer.size property.. If authsIsEmpty or isAddingUser is true then we don't actually need to calculate this.. If authsIsEmpty is empty then we don't actually have to calculate this.. I don't think we need if (hook.graphAuths == null)  as we immediately override it with hook.setGraphAuths(graphAuths);. This should be in a separate file and it might be better as a checked exception.. Perhaps removing a graph should only be allowed if the user actually has access to it?. Remove the buffer.size property. Remove the buffer.size property.. Please could you add some other combination of tests included ones that should error.\ne.g\nstore.getGraphs(\",mockGraphId2,mockGraphId4\");\nstore.getGraphs(\"\");\nstore.getGraphs(\"mockGraphId1\");. Perhaps rename this to 'hasEntityFilters'. Perhaps rename this to 'hasEdgeFilters'. Please could you also write some unit tests to specifically check the validation doesn't fail when there are entities, but without filters.. This should say:\nshould work with any of the 1.8.* versions of Accumulo as well. Perhaps:\nSee our [Store](https://gchq.github.io/gaffer-doc/summaries/stores.html) documentation page for a .... MockAccumuloStore link should be:\nsrc/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/accumulostore/MockAccumuloStore.java\nwithout the accumulo-store bit. This is now inconsistent with FederatedAccessHook.Builder.graphAuths. Perhaps just rename it back to graphAuths.. This logic now means the test FederatedStoreTest.shouldAddGraphIdWithAuths fails.. Please can you rename groupBys to groupBy? There are a few instances of groupBys.. Please could you update the assertions to use assertNull() instead of assertTrue(null == ...)\nAlso, could you add a check to confirm pair.getGroupBy is new String[]{\"timestamp\"} and pair2.getElementAggregator is new ElementAggregator().. Please could you make this an interface we are trying to avoid lots of abstract operation classes.. Please can you use {@code }. Rather than creating a new instance of this for every query, the validator could be a 'private final' field.. Please could we refactor this so we don't have to create 2 separate hashset instances.. Similarly to the comment above, if possible it would be good to do this with a single hashset.. I think some of this logic could be simplified and some of the methods could be removed or some of the arguments could be removed.. Have a quick search through the code and update any federated store.properties so that the properties class is set to  uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.federatedstore.FederatedStoreProperties.\nPerhaps you could update the getters and setters to make them not static and base this class on the other Store Properties classes we have, such as AccumuloProperties.. You might need to update this initialise method now you have FederatedStoreProperties.\nYou could do something like:\n```java\nif(!(properties instanceof FederatedStoreProperties)) {\n    properties = new FederatedStoreProperties(properties);\n}\n````. Please could you have some javadoc for these constants. I don't think they are all \"Operation options\".. Please could you add a javadoc.. Please could you add a javadoc.. Please can you use upper case for enum constants.. Please don't import .* . A lot of the logic in this class is duplicated in ViewValidator. Could you make a utility class for the common logic?. Rather than doing this, it would be better to have separate classes: AggregateValidator, FilterValidator and TransformFilter, which extends FunctionValidator.. This line is not required.. mergedStoreProperties.getId() and/or properties.getId() could be null.. This class doesn't look like it will serialise to/from JSON properly. You have 2 getters for returning the time series information: getInstants and getTimeSeries, one of these needs to be annotated with @JsonIgnore otherwise you will get the same data twice in JSON. You also need a default constructor and a setter for the timeSeries and timeBucket fields. \nAs a lot of Gaffer interactions are done via REST in JSON, it would be great if this class worked over REST. \nYour LongTimeSeriesTest should then extend JSONSerialisationTest and that will add a json serialisation test.. Please could add some more Javadoc to explain that it is configured with a list of GetElements operations.. Perhaps we should make the output type:\nIterable> as we would never expect to do a Path of a large number of Edge that needs to be iterated over lazily. This will mean the edges list can be processed a bit more easily.. Can you test this instead of doing System.out.println please?. If we made this a Set of just the vertex values instead of the wrapper EntitySeed object then it would mean we could be slightly more efficient with our memory usage.. We really need to avoid doing operation.getInput().iterator().hasNext(). It is really inefficient for when run on results from accumulo and it causes the connection to accumulo to not be closed properly. . If the input is empty then I think we should return an empty iterable to make it consistent with other operations.. Should this return an empty iterable?. This validation could go in the Path.validate method. That would mean the validation would be applied before the Operation Chain is started to be executed.. GetElements.toString() isn't very useful. Perhaps you could say something like:\nThe GetElement operations must not contain Entities. Please fix the view for the third GetElements operation.. operations is just a list so you can do operation.getOperations().size(). I think we should avoid doing: Lists.newArrayList(results)\nAs it will bring all the results into memory. Instead can we do: Streams.toStream(results). I think you may as well remove this map phase and just cast the results iterable to Iterable.. Actually you could just do this logic in a for loop instead of using streams.. You could store this as a local variable to avoid having to retrieve it from the edgeTable twice:\nedgeTable.get(e.getMatchedVertexValue(), e.getAdjacentMatchedVertexValue(). I'm assuming this is a limitation of the HashBasedTable that we have to reinsert the value?. You could probably optimise this and just do the conversion yourself here. The ToVertices handler has extra logic you could skip.. I think we would want to extract the opposite MatchedVertex vertex.. Perhaps we could skip the ToEntitySeeds operation here and just convert them to entity seeds as we execute the next operation (if there is even a next operation). Can we avoid creating a new ArrayList here?. Again, perhaps we could remove the new ArrayList construction here?. Is this new ArrayList required?. Please can you create a property for this version and update the NOTICES file.. You don't need this field. See #1379.. Please can you add some assertions to validate the data?. Please can you add some more unit tests to check extracting a graph frame with different views/data.. Please can you change the name of it to \"Documentation\" instead of \"Wiki\". Perhaps you could create a constant for the value so you don't have it hardcoded in 2 places.. Please could you update this sort method so it returns: Sort\nThen the example would just be:\njava\nnew Sort.Builder()\n    .comparators(new ElementPropertyComparator.Builder()\n            .groups(\"entity\", \"edge\")\n            .property(\"count\")\n            .reverse(true)\n            .build())\n    .resultLimit(20)\n    .deduplicate(true)\n    .build(). The compact schema is very similar to the normal schema except for a few fields have been removed, such as the description field. Please could you add a description field to this schema. And add an assertNotEquals to check the compactSchema is different to the schema.. This could be added to core Gaffer. See GetSchema for an example. The FederatedStore could then override the GetTraitsHandler like we do for GetSchemaHandler.. This could be a static constant.. I don't think this is required and it won't be available in core Gaffer.. Perhaps this field could be called: \"currentlyAvailableTraits\". Then the logic would need to be reversed.. When you implement the core GetTraitsHandler you could check to see if the schema contains a visibility property and if it doesn't then disable the visibility trait. Similarly, you could check if the schema contains any aggregated groups - if not then disable ingest and query aggregation.\nIf the schema does not contain any groupBy properties then you could disable query time aggregation.\nAnd finally if the schema has no validation then you can disable the store validation trait.. I don't think rtn = store.getProperties(); is the expected behaviour for all cases. It might be required for the federated store but probably not for AddStoreProperties.. This doesn't really feel like the right place to put this method. It creates a dependency both ways between store and StoreProperties. Perhaps it could just go in GraphLibrary. Similar with resolveSchema.. Please could you add a javadoc to explain what parentSchemaIds does.. I don't think you should include all the properties in the exception.. Yeah I think min is correct.. I think it might be better to not cache the properties in case any of the properties change over time. In the future, if we find it is really slow then we could consider adding a daily cache or something similar.. They look like different lines to me - one is used when a Function isn't found and one is used when a Property is not found.. Instead of assertTrue you can use:\nJsonAssert.assertEquals(). This method needs to be annotated with \"Deprecated\". There are quite a few tests that still use the schema id. If you look at the call hierarchy of this id method then you will see them all. If the test is specifically testing the deprecated id field then it should be updated.. Can this constant be removed?. This method needs to be annotated with \"Deprecated\".. There are still a few usages of this method. Please can we update them unless they are specifically for the old id logic. For example in StorePropertiesTest.shouldRemovePropertyWhenPropertyValueIsNull  and in FederatedGetSchemaHandlerTest.. 'list' should be 'map'. 'list' should be 'map'. 'list' should be 'map'. 'list' should be 'map'. you could use \"else if\" here. Please could you add some extra tests for the new logic.. I think you should validate the input of getElements is null to ensure the input will be populated with the results of ToEntitySeeds.\nThis validation could be done in GetWalks.validate. You would need to validate that all operations (except the first) have a null input. The first should be allowed to be null or populated.. Perhaps add a field for maxHops and default it to null. If you ensure this class is json serialisable then this would allow a sys admin to set a maximum number of hops. Then when the operation is handled we can verify that the number of hops doesn't exceed the maximum allowed.. Perhaps store queue.size() as a variable called hop. To help document that you are using it to calculate which hop you are looking at.. I'm concerned that we could get a StackOverflowError here if there are a large number of edges coming off a single vertex.. Remove this ignore annotation.. Please can you add some tests in this class?. This should not be exposed to users. It should be in the handler.. It doesn't look like they have been 'ignored', the properties has been set to an empty set. Perhaps rename the test method.. Perhaps it should say 'override' in the method name.. It would be good to repeat these tests with globalElements and globalEdges.. Please could you add similar tests for postAggregationFilter and postTransformFilter.. Please could you add tests for setting a global transform.. This should be annotated with \"Required\".. This should be annotated with \"Required\".. We shouldn't collect into a List as that will bring all the results into memory. We should just process the iterable lazily.. You should also implement MultiInput. You should also implement MultiInput.Builder. You should also implement MultiInput>. You should also implement MultiInput.Builder. This PR cannot be merged in until Koryphe 1.1.0 has been released. We cannot depend on SNAPSHOT versions.. Please can you add some information to explain when pruning should be enabled and the effects it will have.. Don't call curr.getAllSources() every time as it create lots of objects.. Please could you rename the iconCircle.png file to logo.png and move it into src/main/webapp/images/. Please could you add Gaffer favicon-16x16 and favicon-32x32?. Please could you remove the images in dependencies/swagger/images that we are not using.. The Gaffer logo you have as a default is not square so setting height and width to 30 squashes it. Perhaps you should adjust the logo so it is square.. If you switch to version v2 in the Swagger ui, then this causes the logo to be added multiple times. We also had a problem like that with the banner, but that has since been fixed.. Perhaps just rename this class to TypeReferenceImpl so it can be used for other TypeReferences in the data module.. This operation (and your other operations) should be registered with their handlers in Store.java.. Do we need the ED generic type? Would it ever be anything other than an Edge?. Do we need these generic types?. Similarly, do we need the generic types?. Perhaps reorder the fields to: preFilters, operation, postFilters. Or add this annotation to improve the serialisation:\n@JsonPropertyOrder({ \"preFilters\", \"operation\", \"postFilters\"}). This allows pre and post filters to be null. Throughout the rest of this class you will need to have null checks for the fields.. We need to come up with a way to get this to work with GraphHooks and the Graph. The Graph needs to be able to update the views on all nested operations. GraphHooks also need to be able to iterate around all operations and update them if required.. Could this be implemented as a Function and used in combination with the Map operation?. I haven't checked, but it looks like you won't be able to iterator around the iterable more than once. You will need something like:\n```java\nreturn () -> {\n    final Iterator vertices = graphFrame.vertices().toLocalIterator();\n    final Iterator edges = graphFrame.edges().toLocalIterator();\nreturn Iterators.concat(vertices, edges);\n\n};\n```\nDoes the iterable need to be closeable?  Is there any way to close the graph frame?. I think we may need to add some validation to ensure the elements don't have properties with names that will conflict with 'vertex', 'id', 'group'. Similarly with SchemaToStructTypeConverter constants.. Have we checked this is ok with multiple Entities with the same vertex? What happens?. Please can you update the NOTICES file.. I just hadn't merged the other branch in.. These functions should extend KorypheFunction.. The constructor is not required.. It would be worth adding a null check for the walk.. It would be worth adding a null check for the walk.. It would be worth adding a null check for the walk.. Not required.. It would be worth adding a null check for the walk.. Perhaps put these walk functions in a walk package: uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.data.graph.function.walk. Let's just get Koryphe 1.1.0 released before we merge this in. In the koryphe version, this should be have some javadoc.. Remember to delete this.. The View class should not reference the NamedView class. It causes a cyclic dependency between the 2 classes. Perhaps you could create a method:\njava\npublic boolean canBeMerged(final View destinationView, final View sourceView);\nIn named view you could override it to to check the destinationView is a NamedView.\nThen in the merge method here you could do:\njava\nthis.canBeMerged(this, view) && view.canBeMerged(this, view);\nThat would check the View is happy for them to be merged and the NamedView class is happy.. Update javadoc.. We recently just fixed a bug in NamedOperationResolver. Please can you apply the same recursion: https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/1588. I.e check if the operation is an instanceof Operations.. Perhaps add some line breaks.. I don't think you need to create a new NamedView object here. Can you create a View object instead?. Before you merge cache.getNamedView(name) in, you should recursively check it doesn't refer to any other named views.. This is only used in one place. It might be better to put this where it is used, so we don't encourage others to use it without realising a new hash map is created with every call.. This could be annoying for people. Could you use the keyword VERTEX instead? Do you also need to check GROUP, SOURCE, DESTINATION and DIRECTED too?. Why does it need entities? It is possible to create Gaffer graphs without any entities at all.. See other comment. Could we change these to ID, VERTEX, GROUP?. Perhaps you could make 0.15d a public static constant - DEFAULT_RESET_PROBABILITY?. I don't think we need this class at the moment. Perhaps just move it onto a separate branch.. I don't think we need this class at the moment. Perhaps just move it onto a separate branch.. I don't think we need this class at the moment. Perhaps just move it onto a separate branch.. This properties file could be simplified, a lot of these properties have default values. You just need:\nproperties\ngaffer.store.class=uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.accumulostore.SingleUseMockAccumuloStore\naccumulo.instance=someInstanceName\naccumulo.zookeepers=aZookeeper\naccumulo.user=user01\naccumulo.password=password\n. A new feature has been added to develop recently. After you have merged in the latest develop branch, please can you add this annotation:\njava\n@JsonPropertyOrder(value = {\"class\", \"name\", \"edges\", \"entities\"}, alphabetic = true). Please could you add a migration step to the issue to tell users that if they want to use NamedViews they will need to add this to any custom cache.ccf files they have. Also, for backwards compatibility please can you make sure you that if a user doesn't set this, then the app can handle it and doesn't crash.. You could merge this for loop and the one before together to avoid having to iterate over the hooks twice.. I think we need the NamedViewResolver to be after the NamedOperationResolver. After named operations have been resolved, we then need to resolve any named views that exist within the named operations.. I don't think we need this updatedOperations list. We are just modifying the existing operations.. You need to use .equals for string comparisons.. I think you need another layer of recursion to check that the resolved named view doesn't need further resolving.. This is a bit tricky to read - perhaps use StringUtils.isEmpty(namedViewInstance.getName()) to simplify your logic.. This has changed the API. A Map is returned instead of a Set. You will need to make this a separate method, e.g \"getSerialisedFieldClasses\".. Perhaps write some other tests to check for different types of classes.. Perhaps just invert the IF logic so you don't need the empty block.. Could we just create the GrameFrame without edges?. I'm not sure about putting this class in the data module and making it part of core Gaffer. Those names are only reserved when using spark. However, it would be useful for users to be aware of these reserved names when they first create a Gaffer schema even before they thing about using spark.\nI would be happy to keep this class here if we included things like: \"vertex\", \"VERTEX\", \"src\", \"SRC\", \"source\", \"SOURCE\", etc. Otherwise we will soon end up having another library that needs to use a slightly different keywords. However, if we are saying these property names are reserved then we really should validate schemas and tell users not to use these names at all. We can't really fail schema validation as we would break any existing systems using these names. Perhaps we include some validation in the core schema validation for these property names, but just log warnings if any of these names are used. In version 2.0.0 we could change the warning to be an error.. What is this plugin used for? It will need to be added to the NOTICES file if we need it.. Please can we make sure this is documented somewhere so users are aware that the reserved properties are skipped.. I know this CHARSET_NAME was copied from NamedOperationDetail, but it would be simpler to remove it and just use our string util: StringUtil.toString().. Ignoring this error means if a user tries to use a named view that doesn't exist it will just not add the view and the user may be unaware that it has failed.. Please can you keep this class in and just deprecate it.. This returns the same thing as getBasicEdge? Can we remove this getFullEdge method?. To simplify things, would it be possible to just remove the simple types and then just use the aggregated types? The aggregated types can be renamed to just LONG_TYPE, STRING_TYPE etc. You can have the aggregate functions in the schema and just not use them.. Do we need these json schema files? Can't we just use the TestSchemas class?. If any users have written their own implementations of AbstractStoreIT then they will need to update it to implement FixedAbstractStoreIT instead. This would need to be highlighted as a migration step. Alternatively, a better approach might be to rename FixedAbstractStoreIT to AbstractStoreIT and rename AbstractStoreIT to something like AbstractStoreWithCustomGraphIT (a better name would be good!).. This could be useful in core gaffer. Perhaps move it into the generator package within the data module.. Why is this test ignored and the logic is commented out? Perhaps remove the ignore annotation and add: assumeTrue(\"Not yet implemented\", true);\nSimilarly with shouldAddElements_visibilitySchema.. I think we need some more verifications to check the data is loaded in correctly, I think we discussed doing a seeded lookup (GetElements) and checking that works to ensure the vertices have been indexed correctly. It would also be worth testing all of the different filters and flags. Similar to what we currently do in GetElementsIT, FilteringIT etc.. I think we need to have some other tests to check failures and check what happens with the different flags are set: validate and skipInvalidElements.. 2 seconds might not be long enough for travis ci. Would it be possible to monitor the ingest and check when it is completed or a max time is hit?. Can this commented code be removed?. Perhaps add assumeTrue(\"Not yet implemented\", true);\nPlease can you make sure these 'not yet implemented' bits are documented in the issue somewhere so we know what work is outstanding?. I think this may need to be generic similar to Limit. I.e If implements InputOutput. It might help when using the OperationChain builder.. Perhaps change this logic to:\njava\n        final Operation nextOp = computedCondition ? operation.getThen() : operation.getOtherwise();\n        final Object result;\n        if (null == nextOp) {\n            result = input;\n        } else {\n            updateOperationInput(nextOp, input);\n            if (nextOp instanceof Output) {\n                result = store.execute((Output) nextOp, context);\n            } else {\n                store.execute(nextOp, context);\n                result = null;\n            }\n        }\n        return result;. This needs fixing. This is required to allow things like the AddOperationsToChain and OperationChainLimiter graph hooks to work. I'm not sure what the best solution is. Perhaps something like this, but it is a bit fragile and would need a fair bit of testing:\n```java\n@Override\npublic Collection getOperations() {\n    if (null == then) {\n        if (null == otherwise) {\n            return Collections.emptyList();\n        }\n        return Lists.newArrayList(OperationChain.wrap(otherwise));\n    }\n    if (null == otherwise) {\n        return Lists.newArrayList(OperationChain.wrap(then));\n    }\n    return Lists.newArrayList(OperationChain.wrap(then), OperationChain.wrap(otherwise));\n}\n@Override\npublic void updateOperations(final Collection operations) {\n    final Iterator itr = operations.iterator();\n    if (null != then) {\n        if (!itr.hasNext()) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Cannot update operations there are not enough operations to set 'then'\");\n        }\n        then = itr.next();\n    }\n    if (null != otherwise) {\n        if (!itr.hasNext()) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Cannot update operations there are not enough operations to set 'otherwise'\");\n        }\n        otherwise = itr.next();\n    }\n    if (itr.hasNext()) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Cannot update operations there are too many operations: \" + operations.size());\n    }\n}\n```\nTo calculate the score of the If operation correctly, we need to calculate the score of the then and otherwise operations and take the largest score. This logic should be done by creating an implementation of ScoreResolver.. These tests have been removed as a context can no longer be created without a user.. I think it would be worth putting a try/catch around 'operation.getPredicate().test(input)' as the predicate may not accept the input type. We should catch any ClassCastExceptions and throw a useful error message for users.. null inputs should be allowed.. I think you'll need to change the parameter to a Boolean, otherwise your shallowClone method will fail if 'condition' is not set.. We need another test to check shallow clone when a condition is not set.. This commented line can be removed.. This commented line can be removed.. See other comment about Ignore/commented code and adding assumeTrue.. See other comment about Ignore/commented code and adding assumeTrue.. Rather than using this mechanism to test classes have the annotation, I think it would be better to use the mechanism we have for checking classes are annotated with JsonPropertyOrder. This is done by adding shouldHaveJsonPropertyAnnotation test to the JSONSerialisationTest abstract class. In a similar way we could add a test to the abstract OperationTest class. Also, for backwards compatibility, we should avoid failing the test if an operation doesn't have the annotation. This is achieved in the JsonPropertyOrder case by using assumeTrue, so the test is highlighted as being 'skipped' but doesn't cause the build to fail.. I don't think we need this annotation.. If you rename version to value, you don't need to include the version field name when you use it. I.e. \njava\n@Since(1.0.0) \ninstead of\njava\n@Since(version=1.0.0). We need this to work in JSON - so I don't think we should have this annotation. Also, this annotation would introduce a breaking change for anyone currently using this in JSON.. This shouldn't need the JsonIgnore annotation.. This annotation would introduce a breaking change for anyone currently using this in JSON.. Could this class go in the serialisation module?. Rather than hardcoded this class name, please could you use: IsTrue.class.getName(). Similarly in you other tests.. Is there anyway we could return \"Comparable\" instead of \"T\"? T is configured to be something that extends Comparable so it would be more useful to tell users it is a Comparable.. This needs to include the Conditional operation.. This should include the conditional operation.. You need a null check for operation.getConditional().. You don't this this else block. Just do:\n```java\nif(null != operation) {... return maxScore}\nLOGGER.warn(\"Cannot score a null operation\");\nreturn DEFAULT_OPERATION_SCORE;\n```. I don't think you should change this interface method signature, as it will cause breaking changes.. The logic will need to be updated when the Conditional operation is added. The conditional operation is always run so the score should always include that. Then the max score from the then/otherwise operation.\nRather than using operation.getOperations(). You can access the conditional, then and otherwise operations directly.. Please could you add some tests for this resolver.. I kind of agree with: public class Repeat implements InputOutput. However, if the operation is designed to repeat, then I think the input type must be the same as the output type. However It is possible to repeat a GetAdjacentIds operation. The input and output types are actually slightly different. Similarly with GetElements. So we probably will need to use public class Repeat implements InputOutput\nRegarding this: Operations   we do this repeat to work with any type of operation. For example repeatedly doing AddElements (no output). Or repeatedly running GetAllElements (no input). Or it could be a chain of operations, consisting of some operations with an input, some with an output and some with both. So I think we will have to leave it as Operations.. These constructors should be removed to encourage users to use the builder.. Perhaps create a constant - TIMES_DEFAULT, equal to 1. And then set 'times' to this default.. Annotate getTimes with @JsonInclude(NON_DEFAULT). just return Collections.singletonList(operation). You will also need to implement updateOperations. This should have some logic like:\nif(operations.size() > 1) {\noperation = new OperationChain(operations);\n} else {\noperation = operations.get(0);\n}. Perhaps create a constant MAX_TIMES_DEFAULT and set it to 100.. I think this can be simplified to:\n```java\nif(null == repeat || null == repeat.getOperation()) {\nreturn 0;\n}\nreturn repeat.getTimes() * defaultScoreResolver.getScore(repeat.getOperation());\n. Just tried the script and it leaves lots of temporary files due to the -e argument.. Please can you put setters/getters at the bottom of the class. Similarly in your other class.. Function tests should extend FunctionTest from the koryphe function library.. I don't think we should limit it to the Gaffer package. Can we just look at all super classes? Just keep iterating up until currentClass is null.. This comment can be removed.. Can this be private?. Could these be sets too?. I realise this looks neat, but it would be more efficient to return straight away if one of these conditions is false, rather than having to calculate all of them up front.. Rather than creating a new HashSet every time, you could use something like CollectionUtils.containsAny(userAuths, validAuth). This just iterates around the collections.. Please could you update the javadoc to include more information about configuring the hook. Detailing how the white/black lists work, mention that all of the fields are optional, etc.. I think I would be tempted to put all of these UpdateViewHook test classes in the one UpdateViewHookTest class.. validate the maxRepeats to make sure the value on the operation is <= the maxRepeats field in this handler.. Add a maxRepeats field. Default it to While.MAX_REPEATS.. Perhaps just move this constant into this class and set it to 1000.. Just get the repeats of the operation.. If you can't calculate a score, just return null.. This needs updating similar to the If operation.. I don't think we need this interface. The BaseBuilder could move to GraphDelegate.. You will need to leave the old static method in too, but you could deprecate it.. You will need to leave the old static method in too, but you could deprecate it.. You will need to leave the old public static method in too, but you could deprecate it.. Please can you annotate this with@Since(\"1.5.0\"). Perhaps add another method parentSchemaIds(final String... parentSchemaIds) for ease of use.. Please can you annotate this with@Since(\"1.5.0\")```.. Please can you update the Datasketches version in the NOTICES file.. Please can you also add the deprecated annotation to the method? Also, can you add the deprecated annotation and doc to the interface method.. This still suggests that the groups are stored in the column families.. This still suggests that the groups are stored in the column families.. Please could you add some javadoc to explain what the currentTraits field does.. Perhaps you could update this test to use a date like 2000-02-03 and check it is truncated to 2000-01-01?. I think this date string should be something like:\n2000-02-03T12:34:56.789Z\nCurrently it is just the same as the offsetDateTime.. Would it be possible to avoid adding this dependency?. This should be wrapped in Collections.unmodifiableSet();. Can you just call op.shallowClone() ?. Perhaps rename this field to unknownEdge. Similarly for the entity.. Please can these fields go at the top of the class.. Perhaps add a bit more documentation to explain how it is configured.. This is going to be quire inefficient. We don't want to construct new serialiser instances every time we need to serialise/deserialise something. We need to change the keyToSerialiser map to be a map of key to serialiser instances.. Please could you add some more javadoc here explaining what it actually does and how to configure it.. Please can you add the 'final' keyword in. It is missing in a few places.. You should check that serialiser is not null. Similarly in the serialise method.. I think we should remove this and force users to provide the byte keys themselves. So, remove this method:  put(ToBytesSerialiser serialiser, Class supportedClass). This null check needs to be done before the serialiser.getSerialiser() instanceof MultiSerialiser\notherwise that line will throw a null pointer exception.. Perhaps rename these to keyToClass and classToKey. Perhaps add a null check for serialiser.. Perhaps add a null check for supportedClass.. Might be better to do:\njava\nfinal Byte key = valueToKeyMap.get(handleClass)\nif(null == key) {\n    return null;\n}\nSerialiser serialiser = keyToSerialiser.get(key);\nreturn null != serialiser && serialiser.canHandle(handleClass);. Perhaps this method should be renamed to getSerialiserDetails() and then rename Content to SerialiserDetail. I think that would make it clearer.. Can these maps be final?. Please could you annotate this with JsonPropertyOrder.. Could this field be final?. I think this error message should say: \"... set to true\". This is going to difficult to maintain. Can you avoid hardcoding all the operation classes here?. This needs to stay as a nested class, otherwise it will cause breaking changes.. This needs to stay as a nested class, otherwise it will cause breaking changes.. Perhaps change the other constructor to call this constructor to avoid duplicating the initialisation logic.. Please can you add an operation that doesn't have an input (like GetSchema) to check it is handled properly.. Please can this be updated to 1.5.0-RC3-SNAPSHOT. Perhaps you could optimise this as it has to load the version.properties file twice, once to get the Gaffer version, then again to get the Koryphe version.. Please could you do a similar thing just before line 88 ( git commit -a -m \"prepare for next development iteration\"). You will need to fetch the new versions, then update the version.properties file again with the new versions.. You could store $('#' + id).find(\"div.footer\") as a variable so you don't have to search for it twice.. Perhaps this could be moved into Koryphe? Similarly with the other new functions. You could keep them in Gaffer for now until Koryphe has been updated, but perhaps just move them to src/test. Perhaps rename this to Identity and again this could be in Koryphe.. Would it be possible to avoid this? Perhaps it would be neater to have a field:\nprivate Map config;\nwhere you can just set arbitrary config in it. This would avoid haven't to add specific logic for migration into the core code.. Rather than calling it \"hasBeenMigrated\" perhaps it should be a config item called \"skipValidation\". . Unfortunately, automatically adding the newGroup transform function in, means if the class is serialised into json it includes this transform. Then if the json is deserialised, it will include the transform twice. Ideally this newGroup (and oldGroup) transform function should only be added at when needed and shouldn't modify the original list of functions.. This should be:\njava\nelse if (opView.isAllEdges() || opView.isAllEntities())\nPlease can you add another test to check it works for both edges and entities.. Please can you format the output type name in the same way that is done for JsonSerialisationUtil.getSerialisedFieldClasses. Sorry please can you do it the other way around? If \"\" then use null.. You could get a null pointer exception here if the value of the option is null. It is probably better to do:\n```java\nif(!Boolean.parseBoolean(options.get(AccumuloProperties.HDFS_SKIP_PERMISSIONS))) {\n    IngestUtils.setDirectoryPermsForAccumulo(fs, new Path(inputPath));\n}\n```. perhaps just put: \njava\nreturn null != string && string.isEmpty() ? null : string;. Please can you also update the hashcode methods.. The toString methods shouldn't be modified.. I think this needs to be updated to:\n```java\n// When\nequalsResult = typeSubTypeValueEmptyStrings.equals(typeSubTypeValueNullStrings);\n// Then\nassertTrue(result);\nassertEquals(typeSubTypeValueEmptyStrings.hashCode(), typeSubTypeValueNullStrings.hashCode());\n```\nsimilarly for the other tests.. Graph hooks need to be stateless, because the same instance is used for every query for different users. So we can't store these maps as fields, they will need to be local variables.. We can't do this because if the OperationChain contained:\nGetElements\nGetElements\nWe would end up adding the hookOpList after both instances of the GetElements operation.. This has been fixed.. This could cause a class cast exception. You will need to check if it is an instance of LinkedHashMap. If not, then you can do: new LinkedHashMap(parameters);. Please could you add a javadoc to this class?. Please can you update this javadoc to explain that given an iterable of inputs it runs the supplied operation for each input, 1 at a time. Then it returns an iterable of all of the outputs.\nFor example:\nA ForEach operation with:\ninput = [\n  [1,2,3]\n  [4,5],\n  [6]\n]\noperation = Count\nWould result in:\n[\n  3,\n  2,\n  1\n]. <I> the type of items in the input iterable. This is the same type as the input to the supplied Operation.\n<O> the type of items in the output iterable. This is the same type as the output from the supplied Operation.. @JsonPropertyOrder(value = {\"class\", \"input\", \"operation\"}, alphabetic = true). You will need to update StoreTest to include the ForEach operation.. Please could you add some more unit tests to test the logic within the handler?. I think you need to remove this if statement and always add the output to the list of outputs. If opInstance isn't an instance of Output then we should add null to the output list.. This could actually now result in a class cast exception.. Changing this public interface to add a CheckedException isn't backwards compatible.. ",

Hi @sterkhedkar,\nMaven is a tool used to build gaffer it can't be used to run gaffer.\nIn order to run gaffer you will need to create some \u201cclient\u201d code,\nI suggest you start by looking at the example folder in the project to get a feel for how to write code to interact with gaffer.\nIf you look at our simple query example here:\nhttps://github.com/GovernmentCommunicationsHeadquarters/Gaffer/blob/master/example/src/main/java/gaffer/example/SimpleQuery.java\nYou can use this as a template for your own code.\nWe also have a getting started guide on a branch here:\nhttps://github.com/GovernmentCommunicationsHeadquarters/Gaffer/blob/G14-user-guide/docs/getting_started.md\nThis relates to the example project and should introduce you to things like writing schemas for your data.\nWe are still working on a full user guide\nHope this helps.\n. As its been over 7 days without a response this issue will be closed.\n. This is expected behaviour, \nThe client side check on if both ends of an edge are valid for set retrievers executes on the client side to check that no incorrect Edges (Not within/between the sets) got through the bloom filter.\nCalling .hasNext() without this check would simply be able to tell you if another Element existed in the accumulo scanner, not if there was a valid Element left.\nIf you were to call .next() and then do the check there, you could get the next Element, check to see if that Element was valid and then find that it wasn't, discard that Element but then find that the iterator has no more Elements left to check, whereupon you would be forced to return null or the last Element again, after the iterator having told you that there was another Element with the .hasNext() method.\nHowever It can be made to behave more like a regular iterator with extra decision logic to scan ahead on a .next() call\n.

Hi @pranita-s \nThe jar you are trying to run doesn't have its dependencies packed into itself, which is why you are seeing that error.\nYou need to run the jar's with -jar-with-dependencies in their name for them to run.\nIn order to create these jar's you need to enable the exampleJar profile when running maven with the -P exampleJar option.\nFor example mvn install -P exampleJar\nI've also added this info to our wiki page : https://github.com/GovernmentCommunicationsHeadquarters/Gaffer/wiki/Getting-Started#examples\n. Merged\n. Hi ,\nThis performance seems slow to us especially the initial query, but we don't have enough information to diagnose the performance\nWe may be able to better tell you what's causing this if you could answer a few questions,\nHow many seeds are you using for your initial query?\nWhat operations are you chaining together to do your depths?\nHow many results are you getting at each depth?\nHow are you querying Accumulo, through a rest-api or through a java app on the Accumulo cluster etc?\nWhat kind of specifications do the Accumulo servers your running on have, are they virtual machines?\nWhat are you using as your Identifiers? Are they Strings, Integers etc? And what serialiser did you choose as your Identifier Serialiser, in addition what serialisers are in use for your properties? \nThe default serialisation for all items if not specified is java serialisation which is very slow which affects performance of querying heavily, its much better to choose serialisers appropriate for your data types from the simple-serialisation-library if you want performance.\n. I've made a change relating to this on the G144 branch.\nI've cached the Connector object inside a store instance, meaning if you can maintain access to the same store instance like in an operation chain you only need to create the zkInstance once. The Connector object its-self can handle multiple threads/operations.\nThe zkInstance is still re-created if a new store instance is created (e.g by a second user) or the underlying getConnection method is called (currently all all but 1 calls pass through the getConnection method on the AccumuloStore class) this is worth keeping because it is good to check that the zookeeper nodes are still available in this case rather than relying on older connections.\n.

Grouping by column Family.\n\"Does this behaviour work across tablets? A-C might be in a different tablet (and on a different tablet server) to A-B. Does the aggregation work in this case?\"\nCurrently all aggregation assumes that all data for the provided ranges lives on the same tablet server, client side aggregation is needed for all cases of aggregation to catch cases where the desired ranges are split across tablet servers.\n. \"Is the client side aggregation implemented? If not then the current implementation will not always work and needs fixing.\"\nIm going to close this ticket and implement client side aggregation before coming back to this.\n. I've Implemented a new Operation that takes one column family and uses this to Summarise over Range's of RowID's within that column family to create one summarised result for that range.\nI ran into some questions when implementing Client Side Aggregation so this will be added later on a separate branch to the operation so at current results may be only partially aggregated particularly in large graphs.\nBoth methods of aggregation discussed above are possible, ROWID aggregation being a specific accumulo operation.\n. One Reason for the restriction is the avoidance of unnecessary parsing to find out if a given element is an Edge or Entity, for example in the accumulostore,  when aggregating properties the aggregation iterator takes the unique group name from the Column Family and knows for this key and Value Iterable how to deserialise the value into gaffer properties.\nIf group names were not unique it would also need to inspect the rowID to determine if the aggregator had the edge or entity to determine which property set the value should be deserialised too. The amount of work to inspect the rowID  would depends on the rowID structure (key-package) and may not be that much extra work, but it does add this extra processing.\n. ## Migration Steps\nThis is a breaking change.\nProblems with the previous method of serialisation in the provided KeyPackages means we have ceased support for the old method of serialisation into the Value/Column Qualifier of Accumulo going forward, if you have existing data it is advised to re-import this data into a new gaffer table using the new format, or write a map reduce job to convert the data from the old format to the new.\nIt is possible to re-implement the old key-packages if you want to migrate versions without migrating your data however this is not advised as this new method is more space efficient and performant, it is highly advised to migrate to the new key-packages as soon as possible.\n. Pretty print isn't enabled on the JSON serialisation of the results coming back from the rest service, but it is on the provided JSONSerialiser class that is often used on the client end.\n. The unit tests don't specifically have a test for if a given property is set to null, \nBut the case is covered by the tests for missing properties, because the behaviour will be the same (asking for a property that doesn't have an entry from the properties map will return null - the correct value and the code checks the value is null on the serialisation and just skips entering that property)\nBut I will add a test in so we can see this in action.\n. ## Migration Steps\nThe Versions of Accumulo and Hadoop have been changed to 1.7.2 and 2.6.3 respectively, while the codebase should still be compatible with the previous versions used we will no longer actively support them and the codebase may become incompatible with these versions at any point in the future.\nIt is advisable if possible to migrate any system running gaffer to the above versions going forward\n. Merged Into Develop\n. Merged Into Develop\n. Merged Into Develop\n. An example of a type value object was created for the testing of gh-335\ngaffer-core/operation/src/test/java/gaffer/operation/data/CustomVertex.java\nThis should be replaced with the Type/Value object created for this issue.\nAlso on the Serialisation of the object, if the serialiser simply did string10string2.\nIf the resulting byte array was placed in the vertex in the Accumulo store the currently implemented key packages will call ByteArrayEscapeUtils on the returned byte array to escape the 0 byte. Similarly any other implemented key packages should escape whatever characters are used to delimit the vertex components (if something other than 0 is used)\n. Merged Into Develop\n. Merged Into Develop\n. It Looks like the API to read/write RFiles is a breaking change from Accumulo 1.7-1.8 and we need to remove this test to build against both.\n. Closing issue, \nInstead of implementing a specific serialiser/function for a map type, \nWe should instead enable generic map/set serialisation/Aggregation. # Migration steps\nThe old method of specifying serialisers has been deprecated, while still useable it is advisable to migrate as soon as is feasible.\nIf you had for example a storeType of prop.string previously you may have specified your serialiser like so : \njson\n{\n    \"prop.string\": {\n        \"serialiserClass\" :  \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.serialisation.implementation.StringSerialiser\",\n        \"aggregateFunction\" : {\n            \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.ExampleAggregateFunction\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nNow you should specify the same like so:\njson\n{\n    \"prop.string\": {\n        \"serialiser\": {\n            \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.serialisation.implementation.StringSerialiser\"\n        },\n        \"aggregateFunction\" :  {\n            \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.ExampleAggregateFunction\"\n        }\n    } \n}\nThis also applies to the vertexSerialiser/vertexSerialiserClass.. Hi, \nFor 1) \nFor the general case of aggregation of a property based on other properties that'll require a bit of thought on our end, your right it isn't currently supported.\nCan you elaborate on your use case for this to help guide our thinking?\nJust a thought based on what you've said so far, \nIf you've got a bunch of elements and just want to aggregate a property based on the \"latest\" value\nIf you don't change your groupBy at query time, then you can use the first bifunction https://github.com/gchq/koryphe/blob/master/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/koryphe/impl/binaryoperator/First.java\n As in Accumulo at least, the elements will be sorted latest->oldest for each element id & groupBy (If you've put the timestamp in the Accumulo timestamp column) \nFor 2) \nThe good news is You can be flexible in allowing new element groups to be created and you don't need to do any import/export to/from tables, bad news you still do need to do a little work, \nOnce you have your updated schema, all you need to do is update the Accumulo table's iterators with the new schema's.\nAnd We have a utility for this \nhttps://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/blob/master/store-implementation/accumulo-store/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/accumulostore/utils/AddUpdateTableIterator.java\nYou need to provide a comma separated list of schema file paths,  a store Properties file path and the argument: update.\nYou can do this programatically through the class by calling main method with the above arguments.\nAdmittedly It's not the most publicly facing API at the moment, we've had some other thoughts around storing schema's in some kind of central location - which could also then make it much simpler to update them on the stores. But we've not really looked at this too much.. The overheads of running Mini Accumulo raise the time taken for tests significantly. \nIntegration tests in particular are a problem, refactoring the IT's to (where possible) use a single store/graph would be best.. Good spot\n. Comments generally need updates/rewrites/reformatting, that will probably have to be done on another branch\n. This is what this does?\nIf includeEntities is true here it throws an exception, otherwise the value is false which doesn't need to be assigned, as we always return false.\n. Done in the executeGet method to avoid having to duplicate the tertiary operator on every Call.\n. Why not add a finally block to these try catches and close these resources there? In this case the streams aren't needed once the objects are created, this could be added in a few of the changed files.\n. This should be de-duplicate edges, also the setting should be set if the option from the accumulo constants  is set (you may want to de duplicate if you know what your doing)\n. I think possibly a new Retriever subclass is needed for all we may be able to simplify other things in a dedicated reliever over doing this check here, this also has a problem of tying in a specific operation to this functionality as opposed to operation calling specific retrievers in their handler. \n. An Entity under this package will always be of length pos (the first delimiter) +2, if its larger its an edge.\n. Because we want to return the position but also do a check on wether what is returned is an entity or edge the check is identical for both cases but you would need to return a complex type if you don't manipulate the variable\n. Can we remove the generics and make it just a set of objects, this will mean this aggregator can be re-used by different types\n. Can this be renamed to StringTreeSetSerialiser or some other variation that references that this serialiser will only serialise tree sets of type string (Or any object that has an accurate toString() method representation)\n. That will aggregate the column qualifier downwards so yes including visibility timestamp and value\nI thought when compared with the RowID aggregator it'd start to make more contextual sense as the iterator naming pattern would be that key portion down.\n. I think we should remove this check and force all tests to call initialise.\nBetter than wasting a check every addElementsCall.\nSimilarly you can remove the check from the BulkImport Operation\n. This method should not be on the interface it only makes sense for specific implementations of a key package.\n. If you haven't specified a property for timestamp then you wont see the result anyway, if your using custom code its best as a general rule not to rely on anything not in the schema.\n. I think that makes it more confusing, its a file of authorisation scores. A max of these is taken but for the actual properties file thats irrelevant its just an auth has a score.\n. The tests show it works without the annotation and the class property is already added in.. Done. ",

    "t616178": "Merged into develop.. We could potentially use Coveralls to do this for us - this also integrates nicely with Travis.\nhttps://coveralls.io\n. The following changes have been applied in order to get codecov integration working:\n\nA new profile has been created (-Ptravis), specifically for building Gaffer on Travis. This is required since the previous profile used in the Travis build process required setting the Maven Surefire plugin's forkCount property to 0, which breaks JaCoCo and prevents the test reports from being generated.\nSince the forkCount property must be set to 1, the tests fail due to memory issues in the Travis containerised environment. To resolve this, fork reuse has been disabled and the amount of heap memory available to the Java process has been increased (-Xmx3072m).\n\nIf there are any issues with the Travis build process in future (entirely possible, as I'm not sure how marginal the build process is on memory at the moment), this approach may need to be revisited.. Closing, as this functionality is available by adding configuration to the MapContext object when creating the MapperGenerator.. Merged into develop\n. Would a change from this:\n\nSchema.Builder()\n      .type(TestTypes.ID_STRING, new TypeDefinition.Builder()\n                                                   .clazz(String.class)\n                                                   .build())\n      .build();\n\n\nto\n\nSchema.Builder()\n      .type(TestTypes.ID_STRING)\n        .clazz(String.class)\n        .build()\n      .build();\n\n\nbe seen as an improvement?\nI have a pattern which can be used to hide the explicit creation of the Builders for components in the parent Builder, but this might come with difficulties when trying to indent the relevant pieces of the chained method calls.\n. Closing for now as the Accumulo store has been tidied up enough. If there are any further issues with the Accumulo store these should be raised under a new ticket.. This is covered by gh-545.. Reopened to add checkstyle configuration to enforce project preferences around final keyword usage.\n. Merged into develop.. Would this likely be solved by gh-548?. The updates to Jenkins in issue gh-544 demonstrate that the current Gaffer build passes on Debian8 and Centos 7, under Java 7 and Java 8. Closing as this issue appears to be solved.. # Migration steps\nThe method for specifying a splits file for Accumulo has changed.\nThe following options are required to set a splits file when carrying out a bulk import:\n\naccumulostore.operation.hdfs.use_provided_splits_file - a boolean flag, set to the String \"true\" or \"false\" \naccumulostore.operation.hdfs.splits.file_path - String representing the file path to use\n\nIf \"use_provided_splits_file\" flag is true, the file path must be provided - this will be used to determine the splits.\nIf \"use_provided_splits_file\" flag is false, the file path must be provided - this will be used to determine where to write the generated splits file to.\n. Reopened to solve issues with undefined states.. Merged into develop.. This has been merged into develop.\n. This issue will be fixed by gh-502.. GetElements requires a generic type which extends ElementSeed, so it's not possible to create an object like GetElements.\nIf the main issue is that some operations specify invalid methods, it might be necessary to refactor the operation classes to move some of the methods into interfaces, e.g.\nGetElements extends AbstractGetIterableElementsOperation\nGetEntities extends GetElements implements WithSeed etc\nThe alternative is to document which methods are supported for each operation and to throw exceptions if an unsupported one is used.\nIs there any preference on this?. Merged into develop-0.7.0. Merged into develop. Merged into develop.\n. # Migration Required\nThe groupId for all packages has been updated from *gaffer. to *uk.gov.gchq.gaffer..\nAny external files containing references to the groupId (e.g. schema files, JSON files containing operation details etc) must be updated in order to work correctly.\nImportant\nIf you have any existing tables created when using gaffer with a previous version then you will need to manually update the class name of a property on that table via the accumulo shell:\n\nopen the accumulo shell: \naccumulo shell\nswitch to your gaffer table: \ntable <tablename>\nupdate the property on your table: \nconfig -t <tablename> -s table.bloom.key.functor=uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.accumulostore.key.core.impl.CoreKeyBloomFunctor .

This will be fixed by issue gh-485.\n. Merged into develop-0.7.0. I've corrected these issues now - the correct artifacts are created in the target/ directories and in the Maven repository.\n. Current thinking for test strategy:\n\nWe will test against 3 different environments:\n- Centos 7\n- Debian 8\n- Windows Server 2012\nThe following Java versions will be tested on each system:\n- Java 7 (latest version available for each platform)\n- Java 8 (latest version available for each platform)\nThis will allow us to support a very wide range of target environments, including Debian or RHEL derived systems.\nA nightly build will be triggered to test all branches on all environments. This will also be used to carry out the release process to Maven Central.\n. After agreeing on a broad strategy with @p013570, I'll add this information to the Wiki.\nThere's still some work to be done to integrate this with the release process, this will be looked at again once we begin publishing artefacts to Maven central.\nClosing this issue for now.\n. This likely needs some extra work/thought before being merged in - what's here is a first pass of a solution to #463 and #466.\n. Abandoning this pull request - this issue will be fixed by PR #488.\n. I've started looking at this issue from the perspective of the socialsensor Graph database comparison benchmarks.\nI've started integrating the Gaffer Accumulo store into their benchmarking project so we can see a comparison against several other graph DB technologies (including Neo4J and Titan).\nThey use a variety of real and synthetic datasets and a number of graph-oriented benchmarks, most of which are easy to support, but some may require a bit more thought or some new analytical functionality.\nOnce I've made some progress I'll try to make this available in the gaffer-experimental project.. # Migration required\nThe format of the Serialiser classes has changed. The serialisers are now generic classes, with the generic parameter being the type of object serialised and the target type for deserialisation.\nThe Serialiser classes are now also responsible for handling nulls. Default behaviour is provided by the AbstractSerialiser class, which should be extended. The default behaviour is to serialise null values as empty byte arrays and to deserialise empty byte arrays to null values again. In combination with the configuration for the Jackson ObjectMapper used, these null values will not be serialised when written as JSON.\n. Merged into develop.. This probably needs some more work/testing. I'm having issues building locally, so wanted to start the process off on Travis to see if the same issues are manifest in the CI environment.\n. There are a couple of consequences to the changes that I've made here, so I'm happy to take suggestions if they cause more problems than they solve:\n- Null handling behaviour is pushed down from the Accumulo Element converter to the individual serialiser classes. This is to provide enough flexibility to be able to discriminate between null values and empty (or default) values. An AbstractSerialiser class has been added which contains default handling for deserialising null values and for serialising empty values.\n- Any Graphs which are created with a visibility property will always result in the visibility property being set on any elements retrieved from that Graph, even if the visibility contains an empty value.\n- Element properties have been modified so that it is not permitted to create a property with a null key or a null value.\nMigration required\nThe format of the Serialiser classes has changed. The serialisers are now generic classes, with the generic parameter being the type of object serialised and the target type for deserialisation.\nThe Serialiser classes are now also responsible for handling nulls. Default behaviour is provided by the AbstractSerialiser class, which should be extended. The default behaviour is to serialise null values as empty byte arrays and to deserialise empty byte arrays to null values again. In combination with the configuration for the Jackson ObjectMapper used, these null values will not be serialised when written as JSON.\n. To clarify, this applies to both external libraries and deprecated classes within the Gaffer project.. Following further investigation, this seems to be specific to my development environment. I'll leave this open for the moment in case the issue relates to Gaffer itself.\n. The release notes for Accumulo 1.7.2 state that 2.2.0 or newer is required. In fact, they run the Accumulo integration tests on Hadoop 2.6.3 - it should be fine (and probably preferred) to stick with the latest Hadoop 2.x.x release, especially if that's likely to match the production deployment environment.\n.

Merged into develop.. As part of this issue, I will also update the existing toString(), equals() and hashCode() methods so that we have a consistent approach across the entire project.\n. I can add those extra methods as part of this issue too.\n. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. @p013570 is this functionality already available through the use of global filters?. Could you have a look at these merge conflicts before I do a review?\n. I've added the missing methods and made sure that properties from base classes are included in the methods (these were being excluded)\n. I think it would be better to just enforce that developers are expected to provide these methods if appropriate. I've updated the Wiki to reflect this.\n. Added a commit which shows what this might look like.\n. # Migration Steps\nIn this issue the following operations have been deprecated:\n\nGetRelatedElements\nGetRelatedEdges\nGetRelatedEntities\nGetElementsBySeed\nGetEdgesBySeed\nGetEntitiesBySeed\n\nThese operations are still available, but will be removed entirely in a future version of Gaffer. These operations have been superseded by:\n\nGetElements\nGetEdges\nGetEntities\n\neach of which have properties which can be set to emulate the functionality of the removed operations.\nThe removed operations have also been removed from the REST API and are no longer displayed when view the Swagger UI. The REST endpoints representing these operations still exist, however, and will not result in any errors for the time being. As with the operations themselves, these REST endpoints will be removed in a future version of Gaffer.\nAll operation chains, workflows etc which depend on the deprecated operations should be migrated to the appropriate new operation.. Closing due to @gaffer01 's comments.. # Migration steps\nVersion 2 of the Gaffer REST API contains a number of changes which require user intervention.\n\nThe OperationChain class is now a subclass of Operation. In order for deserialisation to work correctly, any operation chains written in JSON and submitted to the REST API must contain the type ID in the JSON body. For example:\n\njavascript\n{\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.OperationChain\",\n    \"operations\" : [\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n\nAny users wanting to make use of the new API will be required to add a \"v2\" servlet to their web.xml file. For example,\n\n```xml\n\nGaffer REST example v2\norg.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer\n     \n\njavax.ws.rs.Application\n\n             uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.rest.application.ApplicationConfigV2\n        \n\n\nswagger.scanner.id\nv2\n\n\nswagger.config.id\nv2\n\n2\ntrue\n\n\nGaffer REST example v2\n/v2/*\n\n```\n\nThe API now has four distinct sections:\n\n|Resource|Description|\n|---|---|\n|/graph|The graph root resource|\n|/graph/config|Resources relating to the graph configuration|\n|/graph/jobs|Resources relating to submitting Jobs to the graph|\n|/graph/operations|Resources relating to executing operations on the graph|\nA full list of endpoints (with descriptions) is provided below:\nOperations\n|Method|Resource|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|GET|/graph/operations|list of all operations supported by the current store|\n|POST|/graph/operations/execute|perform the submitted operation|\n|POST|/graph/operations/execute/chunked|perform the submitted operation|\n|POST|/graph/operations/generate/elements|generate elements, as specified in the request body|\n|POST|/graph/operations/generate/objects|generate objects, as specified in the request body|\n|GET|/graph/operations/{className}|get information about the specified operation class|\n|GET|/graph/operations/{className}/example|get an example JSON body for the specified operation class|\n|GET|/graph/operations/{className}/next|list of all acceptable operations which can be performed after the specified operation|\nJobs\n|Method|Resource|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|POST|/graph/jobs|create a new job, based on the Operation contained in the request body|\n|GET|/graph/jobs|get a list of all jobs|\n|GET|/graph/jobs/{id}|get the details of the specified job|\n|GET|/graph/jobs/{id}/results|get the results from running a job|\nConfiguration\n|Method|Resource|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|GET|/graph/config|get all configuration details|\n|GET|   /graph/config/schema|get schema details|\n|GET|/graph/config/filterFunctions|get filter function details|\n|GET|/graph/config/filterFunctions/{inputClass}|get filter function details for given input class|\n|GET|/graph/config/transformFunctions|get transform function details|\n|GET|/graph/config/elementGenerators|get element generator details|\n|GET|/graph/config/objectGenerators|get object generator details|\n|GET|/graph/config/storeTraits|get store traits|\n|POST|/graph/config/isOperationSupported|query the graph to see if a given operation is supported|\n|GET|/graph/config/serialisedFields/{className}|get the serialised fields for a given class|\nStatus\n|Method|Resource|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|GET|/graph/status|get the graph status|.

This PR attempts to fix a bug (or at best some undefined behaviour) where there are some combinations of AccumuloStoreProperties which leave the system in an undefined state when setting up the Accumulo partitioner.. Removing due to renamed branch.. Fixed and merged into gh-434. gh-562 closed and issue fixed.. @gaffer01 Agreed - I've added a test to AccumuloAggregationIT to confirm that this is the case.. Closing to fix some issues. Codecov defaults to showing the coverage of the master branch, so the codecov badge will show \"unknown\" until the codecov changes have been released to master.. The following changes have been applied in order to get codecov integration working:\n\nA new profile has been created (-Ptravis), specifically for building Gaffer on Travis. This is required since the previous profile used in the Travis build process required setting the Maven Surefire plugin's forkCount property to 0, which breaks JaCoCo and prevents the test reports from being generated.\nSince the forkCount property must be set to 1, the tests fail due to memory issues in the Travis containerised environment. To resolve this, fork reuse has been disabled and the amount of heap memory available to the Java process has been increased (-Xmx3072m).\n\nIf there are any issues with the Travis build process in future (entirely possible, as I'm not sure how marginal the build process is on memory at the moment), this approach may need to be revisited.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. The changes for this branch have been merged into gh-140, gh-499 and gh-604.. I've also updated the Maven plugins throughout the project and ensured that the same versions of plugins are being used throughout by adding the version numbers as properties in the main project pom.xml file.. Closing to continue working.. I've added an issue (and a pull request) which fixes this - this PR should be merged in after gh-614.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Closing for the time being.. PR raised on accumlo-website project to add Gaffer to list of related projects.. Merged into develop. Changing approach - will reopen when finished.. This PR contains only Javadoc changes and a method name change - I'm not sure why Codecov is failing.. This is difficult to achieve in practice due to the many ways in which is possible to construct an Edge object - particularly since it is possible to build an Edge incrementally using a no-arg constructor and setter methods.\nWhen would it be necessary for the representation to be modified? Is this something we could implement only when the toString() method is called or when the Edge is serialised?. # Migration steps\nUndirected edges are now created such that their source and destination vertices are ordered. This is carried out when an Edge object is created and should ensure a consistent representation of undirected Edges, removing the need for deduplication in external applications.\nIf the type of object used to represent vertices implements the Comparable interface, the provided compareTo(T obj) method is used to determine the ordering. The \"smallest\" object is chosen as the source. If the objects do not implement the Comparable interface, the toString() method is used instead.\nIt is highly recommended that classes which are to be used to represent vertices implement the Comparable interface. If this is not possible, then the classes should override the default toString() implementation to ensure consistent ordering. If neither of these steps are taken, then consistent ordering is not guaranteed, and users may be required to deduplicate undirected edges in their application.\nThe following methods relating to Element creation have been removed:\njava\nEdge.setSource\nEdge.setDestination\nEdge.setDirected\nand have been replaced with:\njava\nEdge.setIdentifiers(source, destination, directed)\nThe return_matched_id_as_edge_source operation option that used to be available for GetElements operations on Accumulo and HBase has been removed. This option used to flip the edges around to ensure the source was the vertex that was matched by a seed. This produced edges that were invalid and misleading. So instead of flipping the Edges around the result Edges will now always have a matchedVertex field set specifying if the SOURCE or DESTINATION was matched. To allow chaining onto following operations we recommend using GetAdjacentIds instead or using ToVertices. ToVertices has been updated to allow you to ask for the matchedVertex to be extracted or the vertex opposite the matchedVertex to be extracted. See ToVerticesExample.. Merged into develop..

Several possible avenues for performance improvement:\n\npruning of orphaned edges while the elements are being added to the temporary store (reduces overall memory consumption and reduces the amount of data to process when determining the walks)\nPerform walk creation in reverse (starting from known walk destinations and tracing back to start may be more efficient than starting with the initial seed vertices).\n. Closing while improvements are made.. Closing while improvements are made.. It's worth noting that a few approaches could be taken depending on the exact question being asked. Different algorithms are used depending on whether the edges are weighted or not, and whether those weights are nonnegative or not.

Done. I don't think this is required any more.. Could this be moved to a property?. Should we be using an unbounded type parameter here, rather than a raw type?. Same comment here regarding raw types?. Do you need to update your copyright header template?. Did we decide to use the Apache ToStringBuilder to be consistent?. Unnecessary qualified class name.. Would we want any of these to be private? We could return an anonymous class instance in the \"createOutputTypeReference()\" method if so?. There's a mix of underscores and dashes here.. Is there any benefit to making a distinction between 400 and 500 style error responses?. This may need to change depending on the decision on underscores vs dashes from earlier.. Does this Javadoc need updating now that the merge() method has been removed?. Does this Map need to be made protected if there's a getter available?. Example on these two lines of an inconsistency in the way we reference entities:\n\nview.getEntities().entrySet()\ngetThisView().entities.containsKey(entry.getKey())\nNot really sure if this is an issue though?. Redundant telescoping constructor?. Redundant telescoping constructor?. Are there any tests for serialising/deserialising JSON schemas containing parent types? Or any examples of this for the wiki?. Sorry, I mean the call onto this() (the no-arg constructor) which doesn't contain a body.. Have you updated your copyright header yet?. For interest, Java 8 lets us use lambdas now:\n\nelements.forEach((k,v) -> {\n                if (newElements.containsKey(k)) {\n                    newElements.put(k, new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()\n                            .merge(newElements.get(k))\n                            .merge(v)\n                            .build());\n                } else {\n                    newElements.put(k, v);\n                }\n            });\n. Would it make sense for ElementDefinition to extend Cloneable?. Might there be a better name for the \"Finished\" state - presumably this is used to indicate that the task has been completed successfully?. Refactor method signature to key-value, rather than value-key?. Should have consistent imports here (i.e all imported, or all fully defined).. Fixed. Could use JUnit's exception checking here?\ne.g. @Test(expected = SchemaException.class). Copyright header needs updated date.. Have there been some erroneous changes in this file? The class is still called \"EdgeSeed\", but the Javadoc and the equals method now refer to the class as an \"EdgeId\".. Same comment here regarding renaming of ElementSeed to ElementId in Javadoc and equals method.. Same naming comment here as for ElementSeed and EdgeSeed.. Typo. Should be standardised along use of Apache 3 ToStringBuilder?. Should be standardised along use of Apache 3 HashCodeBuilder?. Should these files be part of this commit? (lots of similar files with branch names appended to the file name). Formatting fixes to improve readability.. This dependency should be specified in the dependencyManagement section of the parent pom.. Standardise to match the AccumuloStore class (e.g. should create the Store traits Set in the same way etc). Missing final keyword.. Missing final keyword.. Missing final keyword.. If this is only intended to be used in testing, should this be moved alongside the test classes?. Typo?. This approach is taken in quite a few places throughout the codebase - should we have a standard method for creating an empty Iterable?. Unnecessary inclusion of Object.hashCode()?. Hardcoded strings.. Iterating through properties here since the properties field in Element is private.. Example of method which breaks true immutability.. Could be moved to Builder?. Various Jackson annotations are required here to ensure that the Builder can be used to deserialise objects.. Renamed the source and destination fields in a few places throughout the tests, since the new ordering logic would automatically rearrange these to make \"destination\" the source vertex and \"source\" the destination vertex. Thought it would be simpler to denote this as an Edge from A to B.. This is going to conflict with gh-659. Would you like me to add a commit to preempt any merge conflicts? . Do we want to pass on the original exception object here?. Actually, this will be easier to do after gh-659 has been merged in.. Yeah - this is the obvious fix. I'll add that in.. Good spot - yes, I'll fix that too.. Might it be better to change around the paths for these operations now we're adding the \"execute single operation\" option?\nSomething like:\nExecute operation chain: /graph/doOperation/chain\nExecute single operation: /graph/doOperation\n?. For consistency, do we want to add a chunked implementation of the \"execute single operation\" endpoint?. If there's no implementation here, maybe this is the wrong level at which to introduce this interface?. Can this only be an OperationException, or do we want to catch RuntimeExceptions here too?. Same comment regarding OperationExceptions.. Do we need to agree a standard for formatting? Or at least make sure that everything is using the agreed specification? I've been seeing quite a few places in PRs recently where there are formatting differences.. We might need to check to see if some of these special implementations should be left as they are - there's a debate to be had around making the implementation uniform throughout the project vs keeping some flexibility to handle special cases like this. @p013570 might have an opinion on this. Sorry - I didn't mention this in the original issue ticket.. I've noted on gh-890 that we need to make sure we're all using the same formatting settings to avoid changes like this creeping into pull requests too often. We need to agree and publish this somewhere and make sure we're all following it.. Should this line read:\n.append(\"schema\", new String(toJson(true), CommonConstants.UTF_8))\n?. Should we delegate to the supplier comparator object here?. Is this a typo?. This field is referred to as \"destination\" everywhere else in the code base. There will some migration required, so is it worth changing this so that this is consistent everywhere?. Is there a compelling reason not to just use a Map here?. Should we be adopting a standard practice of using primitives everywhere unless the boxed version is specifically required?. Would a method with varargs be useful or more readable in some cases? e.g.\nCloseableUtil.close(operationScores, authScores). Alternatively:\njava\nreturn map.entrySet()\n          .stream()\n          .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue())\n          .collect(Collectors.toMap(Map.Entry::getKey, Map.Entry::getValue, (v1, v2) -> v1, LinkedHashMap::new));\nNot sure which is more readable?. This should say 2017 - have you updated the template in your IDE?. As we are adding a new serialiser for the Java Date object, would there be any benefit to adding a serialiser for the Java 8 DateTime family of objects? It's heavily discouraged to use the old Java Date classes in favour of the new APIs (e.g. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html) - should we be supporting these?. Should we also be adding the @Deprecated annotation?. Could this method be moved to EdgeId to reduce duplication? It's shared between the EdgeSeed and Edge classes.. Could this method be moved to EdgeId to reduce duplication? It's shared between the EdgeSeed and Edge classes.. Is this an extra character that has crept in? I've seen a few of these dotted around the test classes.. It feels like we have declarations for variations on this \"EdgeDirection\" enum in a few different places - would it be better to have one implementation in the core module?. Does it matter if both are empty?. Could this just be:\nreturn getIds(graphId) != null;\n?. Should be:\n* Copyright 2017 Crown Copyright\n?. Would it be useful to have a method on the graph library API to check for the existence of a schema with a specified ID, e.g.\nif (null != parentSchemaId && !graphLibrary.schemaExists(parentSchemaId))\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Schema could not be found in the graphLibrary with id: \" + parentSchemaId);\n}\n?. Same comment as above regarding copyright headers - if this is a new file, it should have 2017 as the copyright year.. Done. Is it a good idea to write these ourselves? There are several other solutions from the libraries:\nCollections.disjoint(collection, objects); // pure Java libraries\nCollectionUtils.containsAny(collection, object); // Apache Commons. Do we need to be able to unlock as well?. Is this direct access to the property definitely safe?. That sounds reasonable - I just wanted to make sure we'd considered use of the libraries.. Fine.. Elsewhere we are carrying out null checks before calling Collection.putAll() - should we be doing that everywhere?. Should we take a look at the hierarchy of test classes we're using throughout Gaffer and come up with something which is reusable in different modules? For example, the GraphHookTest.shouldJsonSerialiseAndDeserialise() test method should appear everywhere that we test a class (or type of class) which should be serialisable. Is there any value in a hierarchy which features a SerialiseableTest<T> interface (possibly with a default implementation)?. Same comment as earlier regarding null checks on method parameters.. No - this shouldn't have been changed.. I've added an extension point to the ApplicationConfig class.. This should have been changed back to 2.25.. Agreed.. Reverted.. No, this has been removed now.. Is there a reason for preferring this Guava constructor over the Collections library?. Is this method used any more?. Could you check this commented block?. Could you be a little more specific?. The reference name here should be longer than one character - could you update this to:\npublic boolean equals(final Object obj) {\n    // ...\n} \nCould you also update the other equals() methods too?. Could you update your formatting settings to avoid changing formatting like this between branches?. Do you need to update the year in your header template to 2017?. Could you add some javadoc to this class (and the other new classes) please?. Does this method need to be deprecated too?. What happens if graphId is null?. Does this class need some Javadoc?. Was there a reason for removing the equals() and hashCode() methods?. There shouldn't be a responseContainer parameter here, since this operation returns a single value and not a list.. Do we need to enforce any restrictions on the characters that are allowed in the description field?. Could you add in a test which results in a valid OperationChain being successfully validated?. The nulll object should be first in this equality check.. Same comment on these lines regarding the order of objects in equality checks.. Same comment on these lines regarding the order of objects in equality checks.. Missing final keyword.. Does this still result in the correct behaviour if the output path does not exist in the filesystem?. Is this the correct import? Should this be a Guava class?. Could these two lines be moved inside the first branch of the if statement below? This object is only used if the condition is true.. Is this the right import to use?. Same question regarding imports - should this be a Guava import?. These implementations are all identical now - is it possible for this method to be pushed up to the JobFactory interface as a default method?. These test methods should begin with the keyword \"should\" and should describe the expected behaviour of the test, for example:\njava\n@Test\npublic void shouldSerialiseDeserialiseEdge() {\n    // Test logic here\n}. Is there an opportunity here to create a KryoSerializerTest which is extended by the other test classes? The implementation details in each of the test methods are very similar.. The description field is deprecated in v1.5.X and isn't used anymore.. Done.. I think this is a merge issue - fixed anyway.. Done.. Done.. Removed.. Done for the messages - felt a little unnecessary to do the status codes too.. Removed.. Fixed.. Removed.. I've uncommented these lines as they were added on another branch.. Done.. Are we sticking to a convention of ordering the constant part of the equality check first?. Missing final keyword.. Should this be:\njava\nassertFalse(returnedGraphs.containsAny(unexpectedGraphs));\n?. Agreed that this is a potential issue - I'll add an exception here if it was not possible to parse one of the date strings.. Missing class level and method level javadoc.. Try to avoid adding extra unnecessary whitespace.. This is a redundant interface implementation, since the InputOutput<?> interface extends Operation.. We should prefer the use of !Map.isEmpty() here.. We should prefer the use of !Map.isEmpty() here.. We should prefer the use of !Map.isEmpty() here.. We should prefer the use of !Map.isEmpty() here.. Missing class level and method level Javadoc on this new interface.. Potentially - this is mostly a copy of the GetDataFrameOfElements class so I was expecting this to have the same effect as delegating to a new GetDataFrameOfElements operation. Delegating would probably be better to avoid having to update the logic here in two places and would also make this class a bit smaller.. Could you add a comment here please?. What will happen if the selection value is greater than the size of the Iterables contained in the input? Should we try to protect against this? Ideally this validation would take place in the Operation#validate() method.. Does it make sense to return a brand new Schema object if the input operation was null?. Does this comment need to be updated, or with this method only ever be invoked via the OperationChainLimiter GraphHook?. Do we want this to be:\nInteger getScore(final T operation)\n?. Should a type parameter be added to the NamedOperationScoreResolver as well?. *including. This is difficult to do since the size of the queue can change after that variable would have been assigned (we'd have to track all changes to the size of the queue). I'll add some documentation to make this clearer.. The number of stack frames is correlated with the number of hops, rather than the number of vertices, so this shouldn't be an issue.. Done. Done. Done. Done.. Added more description to the class level Javadoc.. Is this meant to be a copy of the Koryphe class, or should we just be using that one instead?. Is this explicit constructor required by Jackson?. Copyright header should be updated - same goes for the rest of the new files in this PR.. Remove commented lines.. It would be good to see some unit tests which look at the effect of building this Map object with invalid arguments.. Aren't we forcing the users to provide a list of functions now, even if that list only has a single entry?. Is this function serialisable? Might we want to inherit from KorypheFunction?. Could you add some Javadoc describing this function please?. Might there be a use case where having this functionality as part of the Walk class might be useful as well? Would methods like:\nwalk.getStartVertex()\nor\nwalk.getDestinationVertices()\nbe useful?. Could you add some unit tests for these methods please?. Ok - fixed now.. This issue builds on the implementation of the GetDataFrameOfElements operation which relies on these keywords to create Rows (for the DataFrame) from the Elements in the Gaffer graph. Any changes applied here would also need to be made to the GetDataFrameOfElements operation.. See my comment on your other comment.. It doesn't need entities strictly speaking, but a GraphFrame object created without any entity objects will not be query-able due to the internal representation used by the Graphframes library. If a user has a graph (or creates a query) which has only Edges, they would expect to be able to carry out operations such as PageRank or ShortestPath, as neither of these algorithms would require the Entities to be present. The options are: prevent a GraphFrame from being created without Entities being present (as I have done here) or add dummy entities to the GraphFrames object when the user does not specify any entities (this will enable users to run more queries on the GraphFrames object). Do you have any preference?. Done.. Done.. This is used to compile a Scala utility class. I've updated the NOTICES file.. Added documentation to the class describing the new behaviour.. Updated to allow the creation of GraphFrames with empty edge DataFrames, though some of the analytics will not work correctly if no edges are present - perhaps we need to validate the GraphFrame when executing specific algorithms?. Usage of <code> tags should be replaced with {@code} markdown.. Does this only make sense if the operation being repeated also implements InputOutput<I, O>? If so, the class signature could be amended to:\njava\npublic class Repeat<I, O> implements InputOutput<I, O>, Operations<InputOutput<I,O>\nThis then would indicate that the Input/Output types are the same:\njava\npublic class Repeat<T> implements InputOutput<T, T>, Operations<InputOutput<T, T>\nPerhaps there is room for two of these operations, one which is more general and one which provides a bit more type safety? Or does that introduce unnecessary complication?. We don't need these constructors - the default value of maxTimes can be set when the field is declared. This would would only be overridden by an operation declaration JSON file. (Like we currently do for GetWalksHandler.. Would it also be useful to have a simple integration test which demonstrates this operation working against a store which contains elements?. Usage of <code> tags should be replaced with {@code}.. Are the operation objects forthenandotherwiseboth also required to be of the typeInputOutput?. Raw type here forCollection. Raw type here forOperations```.. Is the point not that we need to create a Collection with the right number of operations? If so we could do:\nCollections.nCopies(times, operation). These schemas are currently used by other tests throughout the framework. A future issue will deal with the removal of these schema files later.. Could you update your header template to 2018?. Could you update your template for the copyright header so that the correct date is included?. Would it be better for these to be public constants inside the While operation class? Do we gain anything from having an additional utility class just for these constants?. ",

I'll make up my mind in a sec. waiting on #1472. within: gh-1297. probably needs null check, or if null clear the key.. wrong branch. typo in branch name. Not an optimal solution.. The byte[] has the first byte as the key to which serialiser to use.. https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/blob/gh-1771-multiSerialiser/core/serialisation/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/serialisation/implementation/MultiSerialiser.java\njavadoc I hope explains enough.. When the schema vertex serialiser is blank, instead of a serialiser being guessed and supplied by gaffer, it will instead error and suggest using a MultiSerialiser. The user can still ignore this and use a regular serialiser, it just can't remain blank like previously done.\nThe MultiSerialiser only uses 1 additional byte in the byte[].\nThis is breaking change, because of the new error message to suggesting a vertex serialiser instead of previously guessing and inserting one.\nHowever the change is backwards compatible with existing data, by explicitly stating the correct vertex serialiser to use.. In example of the Integer class their are three IntSerialisers which (hopefully) are improvements on the last. By using a MultiSerialiser new IntegersSerialiser can be added but the old versions would still backwards compatible. This may give size or speed improvements.. @p013570 \nInteresting side effect.\nBefore:\nWith an unordered edge int->int the order doesn't matter.\nNow:\nWith an unordered edge with different vertex types. int->string the direction of the edge doesn't matter, but the types do matter. I experienced a flip in the scr/dest when string was being placed within the int vertex.\nHad to add directed = true to the schema and edge object.. The solution to problem:\nWhen the Vertex types of an edge are detected to be different, then validate that directed == TRUE, else throws error. \nThis will ensure consistent representation without flipping around different types.\nUpdate: this was not the solution. It\u2019s not possible for any user to currently be creating \u201cundirected edges with different vertex types\u201d\nThis is because within the Edge Builder for an undirected edge natural ordering is applied to the src/dst within orderVertices().

If the edge is undirected, then saying in the schema that the source is a string and the destination is an integer is only saying that one of the vertices is a string and one is an integer. There isn't really a source and a destination in an undirected edge. The getSource() and getDestination() methods on an undirected edge are just ways of returning the 2 vertices, there isn't really a source and a destination.\nSo currently (the recent change) direction was being enforced for different vertex types, this could be removed. But their needs to be a way to pull the undirected first value from accumulo and place it in either of the field that is expecting a String and the second value into the field that is expecting a Int. Otherwise later validation is going to fail.\n\nWe don't need to retain information in the key package about whether an undirected edge has been flipped, as the flipping is irrelevant. The constructor takes care of deciding which one is the source and which is the destination, by comparing them however it can. This is a convenience method so that representations of undirected edges from toString() or as JSON will always be consistent \n(if we don't ensure they're ordered then undirected edge A-B would appear different to undirected edge B-A when printed using toString() or converted to JSON - this causes problems for downstream systems).\n\nschema= group:1 scr:String dest:String\ninput (a,b) creates an undirected edge src:a dest:b \ninput (b,a) creates an undirected edge src:a dest:b \nbecause vertex types are the same.\nIn accumulo these will aggregate together and be displayed as src:a dest:b \nschema= group:1 scr:String dest:int\ninput (a,1) creates an undirected edge src:a dest:1\ninput (1,a) will fail validation and not make it to store because it's not legal with schema group:1\nif you created a new group:2 for (1,a) these will not aggregate because group:1 and group:2 are different edges.. > My original comment on this issue was that there is no issue. It's working as intended. I haven't seen anything above to change that.\n\nThe only possible issue is that if you have different vertex types for source and destination in an undirected edge then we may use the wrong serialiser, e.g. if the source is a string and the destination is an integer, then if they're flipped when an edge is created, we may try to use a string serialiser for the integer. \n\nThe MultiSerialiser can workout which serialiser to use based on the byte[] encoding byte.\nThe problem later is when row (1,\"a\") gets made into an edge(1,\"a\") then validated for use it fails, 1 isn't a string & \"a\" isn't an int.\n\nThere are a few possible solutions:\nLeave it as is and document that if you use different types in undirected edges your serialiser has to deal with that, or else it breaks;\n\nI think the edge.builder and orderVertices() will break it before it gets to the serialiser by swapping values the wrong way round for the validator.\n\nNot allow schemas with different types for the source and destination in undirected edges (but I'm not sure we can do that - the directed field is just a type and we may not know when that is always false); \n\nThis was the solution that was used in the PR but I'm moving away from this, to allow undirected different types.\n\nSpot situations where the serialiser for the source and destination in an undirected edge are different and automatically add information to the serialisation that specifies which was used.\n\nIf I'm understanding you this is what the MultiSerialiser does already, it places a byte in the byte[] to know which serialiser to use for the byte[].. > In the PR that's been merged for this, what does the line\n\nif (!srcClazz.equals(dstClazz) && !Boolean.valueOf(edgeDef.getDirected())) \nactually achieve? edgeDef.getDirected() returns the name of the type, not the class so testing Boolean.valueOf(edgeDef.getDirected()) is true doesn't achieve anything.\nIn the test shouldValidateEdgeWithDifferentVertexDirectionTrue, if you change the name of the type from \"true\" to \"myTrue\" then it fails and says it's invalid, even though we don't know it's an undirected edge. All we know is that the type of the directed field is called \"myTrue\" and is a Boolean. It may always be true and the edge may be directed.\n\n.type(\"myTrue\", new Builder()\n                        .clazz(Boolean.class)\n                        .validateFunctions(new IsTrue(), new Exists())\n                        .build())\nNicely spotted thank you.\nAs described above I now believe the method validateEdgeWithDifferentVertexTypes() (which contains this spotted bug) should now be removed to allow undirected edges with different types, and instead make the changes suggested for orderVertices()\n. > That's a bug in the automatic validation then. It's a valid edge and it should be possible to add it to a graph. That doesn't change any of the other arguments.\nAre you saying that you believe that creating and undirected Edge(1,\"a\",group1) and adding it to a graph with a schema that is expecting undirected edge(String,Int,group1) should be legal and the graph should accept it and all validation should pass? \nIf so initially I imagine this would require a special behaviour for validation of undirected edges with different vertex types. >>Otherwise later validation is going to fail.\n\nWhat later validation? There shouldn't be any validation that assumes that the string is the source and the int is the destination in the case of an undirected edge.\n\nWhen vertex type is defined e.g String.class I think a koryphe validation isA(String) is auto added. So when it see's a Int it fails.\n\n\nIn accumulo these will aggregate together and be displayed as src:a dest:b\n\nThey won't necessarily be aggregated together.\n\nrow1 scr:a dest:b \nand \nrow2 src:a dest:b won't be aggregated together?\n\n\ninput (1,a) will fail validation and not make it to store because it's not legal\n\nIt is legal. If it's not the validation is wrong.\n\nkoryphe validation isA(String)  and isA(Int) get auto added for the src/dest based on schema.\n\n\nSo currently (the recent change) direction was being enforced for different vertex types...\n\nAs noted above, the recent change (the one merged in the PR for this issue) doesn't enforce that.\n\nYep thats now a bug, the change to enforce directed edge for different vertex types I don't think should be used I think the whole method should be ripped out and instead orderVertices() and possibly KeyPackage changed.. - Users should be able to specify Undirected Different Vertex Type Edge.\n- The Edge Builder for a UDVT edge will behind the scenes order based on the vertex classes.\n- The Schema builder for a UDVT edge will also order the schema based on vertex classes.\nUser defines UDVT edge schema as (src: Z.class, dest: A.class) schema.builder creates (src:A.class, dest:Z.class)\nUser defines UDVT edge as (z, a) edge.builder creates (a,z)\nUser defines UDVT edge as (a, z) edge.builder still creates (a,z)\nUDVT Schema and UDVT edges alway match up.\nMultiSerialiser takes care of the serialisation of these types.\nA User should not be confused when schema and edges are returned in a different order to the input as they have already specified that the edge is undirected..

I shall implement a test for a serialiser that overwrites the default.. @gaffer01 Correct, this is a left over typo from when the appended bytes where being escaped, but this was incorrect behaviour and was append to the end without escaping. However as you spotted I didn't amend the initial array size.. int currentPosition = escape(bytes, temp, 0);. @gaffer01 The importance here is the condition under which to throw an exception and type of exception.

    "m316257": "This issue could be resolved like this:\n- In the store schema we specify properties that can be used as 'group-by' keys for a reduce operation (group-by followed by aggregation)\n- in some stores these group by keys are ordered (for example Accumulo), in others they are not (like a hadoop store where reduce operations are part of map-reduce and, in-principle, any property could be part of a key or a value)\n- so in the store schema we no longer have mappings to 'positions', this is implicit in the ordering of the keys.\nAdditionally\n- Security is promoted to being a top-level concept. Gaffer can do this as a filter operation. The idea being that in the store schema, a property can be marked as 'visibility' (or something similar).\n- Some stores (such as accumulo) implement their own security. In this case, the actual implementation can be optimised by pushing it down to the store.\n- by doing this we allow the grouping of reduce keys described above because if we specify visibilities per element we know that in accumulo these go in the visibility column. Any remaining group-by keys go in the column qualifier.\nThis should make the concept of reduce on a Gaffer graph a lot more general.\n.

    "ac74475": "Being able to prune unwanted properties would be particularly beneficial for the Parquet store.. Code base has been refactored, with improvements made to the testing as well as new parquet reader and writer that works directly with Gaffer Element's rather than going via Avro or Spark parquet readers/writers.. Need to make a quick change to fix a bug. Renaming the ParquetStoreProperties to ParquetProperties (for consistency with other stores) may cause confusion between the Gaffer ParquetProperties and the Parquet ParquetProperties. Therefore I think we should leave this as it is.\n. The way I thought of doing it would be just to see what the visibility property is from the schema and then validate an elements visibility property against their user auths in the RetrieveElementsFromFile class.. Closing while solving conflicts from merging in the latest develop branch. Trying out the improvements with large volumes of data, so there may be more improvements to make. Ready to be merged. The behaviour is the same with the ParquetStore as the AccumuloStore. I just thought we could alert the user if they do not set the input, while still working as it currently does if it is a stage in an operation chain. So from what @p013570 wrote this is just a matter of each GetElementsHandler throwing an error if the input is null. . Updated the indexing to only store the Parquet objects of the first row which correspond to the indexed column. This removes the need to either run a Spark reduce job over the whole file or having to iterate over all the index for each seed and potentially still send a filter to a file and get no results.. This will require the pruned Parquet schema being passed into the ReadContext when calling the ElementReadSupport.init() method instead of the full schema.. Can you update the Parquet Store readme to say that it is now using Parquet version 1.8.2. Also the NOTICES file will need updating. Closing while changing the way the sorting is done, so it just sorts within each split partition. So at the moment the GetElementsAsDataFrame does not apply the visibility filter. Also there are no Unit tests for the VisibilitiesUtils code.. We will also need to change the ingest process to add the visibility column into the key when aggregating data.. This looks like the same issue as #1100 to me. I agree with @gaffer01's explanation of how this should be implemented.. The Parquet Store README will need updating to reflect these changes. This looks like it is down to the individual file sizes being large rather than any particular bug in the code. There is now a limit on the number of files you can output based on how many Parquet writers you can have open in memory at any time, which is why it has not got slower as I have had to output to less files. A way around this would be to have more memory allocated to each Spark executor.. So while the larger the files the slower the read will be, it is actually the Parquet version that makes the biggest difference. When we went from 1.8.1 it took 600ms to query a 60MB file for a single value. After upgrading the Spark version and therefore the Parquet version to 1.8.2 the time to do the same query on the same data now takes 75219ms.. Where possible I reuse the FileSystem object, so this is only applicable in the two Callable classes where it is not getting the FileSystem from the Store.. This if statement has to come at the end as it applies to the element set within the previous if statement.. This has been done. Given you know the size of the ArrayList, you could construct the ArrayList to the desired size.. Same as the previous comment. The folder structure needs to represent the package structure, visibilities is capitalised in the folder structure.. Can we rename this so it makes more sense in the context of the Parquet store, for example ElementVisibility. The filter step should only be applied when required, I expect Spark would optimise it out anyway but we shouldn't require it to.. Why is this change necessary? Any arrays that have come from a Spark row should be a WrappedArray. . All validation and filters should really be applied by the RetrieveElementsFromFile class so that the functionality is computed by the threads per file rather than by a single thread.. We usually try to have the constant first so \"null != e\" would be prefered. ",

Does anyone have any objections to renaming ElementSeeds to ElementKeys? It looks a little odd if Element extends ElementSeed - could get confusing with ElementComponentKey, though?\n. Looks good - could we specify these so they can be tailored for different auth tokens, though?. Hi,\nThanks for your contribution - the functions look really useful.\nWe don\u2019t usually add functionality like this directly to our value objects, though, rather we add that logic to external functions. You can see an example of that if you look at the FreqMapAggregator in the functions package. So rather than adding an \u2018aggregate\u2019 method to the FreqMap, we\u2019ve created an external function that accepts 2 FreqMaps and merges them together.\nSimilarly, we\u2019d prefer to create an external FreqMapFilter function, that takes a Predicate as an argument that is used to filter the keys. The Koryphe project already has a Regex matching predicate that you could re-use for adding the regex functionality.\nI guess it\u2019d look a little like this:\n```java\nclass FreqMapFilter extends KorypheFunction\n{\n    private Predicate keyFilter;\npublic FreqMapFilter() {}\n\npublic FreqMapFilter(Predicate<String> p)\n{\n    keyFilter = p;\n}\n\npublic FreqMap apply(FreqMap input)\n{\n    //iterate through the entries in input FreqMap and remove if keyFilter predicate test fails\n}\n\n}\n```\nYou can then use the Koryphe Regex predicate to get the specific functionality you want:\nFreqMapFilter fmf = new FreqMapFilter(new Regex(\u201cmyPattern\u201d));\nFreqMap filtered = fmf.apply(myFreqMap);. Is this now superseded by #2088 ?. We should open another issue to cover the parameter substitution bug. Updating AddNamedOperation to use the Operations interface should be sufficient for this one.. The operation authorisations are determined at deployment time based on the system administrator's configuration. There isn't a fixed configuration that can be tested, so OperationAuthorisorTest specifies it's own authorisations for the tests (opAuthorisor.json from the resources directory). If you want to test other combinations, you could create different versions of this file for different tests.. We may want to consider operation chain scoring as well - see NamedOperationScoreResolver. Currently this looks up the named operation in the cache and returns the score associated with it. This should be updated so that any Operation returned by getOperations() is also considered and added to the score.. ",

I had to deploy both accumulo-store-[version]-tests.jar and integration-test-[version]-tests.jar to get the tests to pass.\nDo you know if there is any reason that those tests use a serialiser that is implemented in the test classes rather than using one from the serialisation library? Is it okay to switch those tests to use StringSerialiser instead, as per my commit?. This commit fixes the issue by ensuring that the iterators always run with the version of Jackson that they have been developed against, rather than the version that is in the Hadoop lib directories.. This hopefully shouldn't be that difficult. We are already running the integration tests against a single store when we run them on AWS.

It'd be nice to be able to very easily 'pick up' properties as you traverse, but perhaps that's a separate issue?. No, this is for a specific use case.  We need to be able to handle byte[] input to the generator, rather than deserialising things as a string.. Failing test in Parquet store - happy to approve once this is resolved.. Are all standard gaffer operations going to implement this method?  Or is this something that's going to be done by exception rather than default?  . Just a thought - it might be better to use Flinks batch API to load from a file rather than the Streaming API. . Should really be logged as an error. Should we not be highlighting the fact that the data format has changed?. If we're seeing incorrect date formats, is it not worth logging this/reporting it to the user?  Otherwise it's going to look like data is loading, where actually it's being dropped because of the timestamp. Is this a duplicated line?. ",

I get this:\nperson_id_12345\\x00\\x01 entity:\\x06person [Public]\nAnd if I remove the Aggregator iterator from the table I see both records with both properties as are wont because there is not Versioning iterator on the table:\nperson_id_12345\\x00\\x01 entity:\\x06person [Public] \\x00'A guy who does the thing for the stuff.\\x00\\x00\nperson_id_12345\\x00\\x01 entity:\\x06person [Public] \\x00'A guy who does the thing for the stuff.\\x00\\x00\nI don't get properties back from any query or Gremlin traversal because they are \"hidden or removed\" by that iterator.  Does this clarify what I am experiencing?\n. Ooooohhhh... right. Crap.  I totally see that now.  I look at the docs daily and completely didn't put two and two together.  I will mess around with it and get back to you will y findings.  Until then, super big thanks!. That would be extremely helpful!. I think I have found the issue... or at least where it may originate.\nMaking all the relevant changes you suggested I updated all my store and schema documents to your propeosed versions and ran this code:\n```java\nGafferPopVertex sourceVertex = new GafferPopVertex(\"entity\", \"id_123\", graph);\nsourceVertex.property(\"type\", \"first_type\");\nsourceVertex.property(\"visibility\", \"Public\");\nsourceVertex.property(\"description\", \"This should work.\");\ngraph.addVertex(sourceVertex);\nGafferPopVertex sinkVertex = new GafferPopVertex(\"entity\", \"id_999\", graph);\nsinkVertex.property(\"type\", \"second_type\");\nsinkVertex.property(\"visibility\", \"Public\");\nsinkVertex.property(\"description\", \"But it isn't for some reason.\");\ngraph.addVertex(sinkVertex);\nGafferPopEdge edge = new GafferPopEdge(\"knows\", sourceVertex, sinkVertex, graph);\nedge.property(\"weight\", (double)0.5);\ngraph.addEdge(edge);\n```\nNow... all vertex and edge properties go in just fine.  But if I re-run that same method all properties are removed by the Aggregator on the table.\nI have tried the aggregators for Exists, IsTrue, IsFalse, Sum, and Max.  All behave the same way.\nUnfortunately my cluster is currently running at JDK 1.7.  I cannot update it to 1.8 this week so I will have to get back to you on the changes when I can run at 1.8.  I really appreciate you help and will let you know soon about the update to 0.6.1!!!\n. I finally got back to this and yes... that is exactly what I was thinking.  I was just messing around with the current build, modified some of the schema and it magically was working.  I really, really appreciate you taking a look into this.  I'll owe you a pint!. ",

    "leerho": "@gaffer01\nThanks for the quick reply. There is another sketch already in the library that we are using actively at Yahoo that you might be interested in using: The HllMap. See our website for more info.  It is strictly for real-time tracking of unique IDs for many millions of keys.  We didn't have the need to ser-de, but if that is important, let us know.  \nIn addition to VarOpt, we have been considering PCA, K-means, and possibly wavelets, but generally moving into more vector-based sketching.  We are a tiny team and prioritization is largely based on feedback and sound use cases (and published theoretical proofs of error bounds :) )  So your participation in our emerging community would be appreciated. \nThe PR DataSketches/sketches-core#142 is being actively worked on. \n. @gaffer01 \n\nThe comments on HLLMap say that it is optimized for many millions of keys - does it have any advantages if the number of keys is small, e.g. if there was a need to store several (<5) HLLs on each node, would HLLMap offer a storage advantage over just storing a map from key to HLL?\n\nThe short answer is no. Don't use the HllMap for small key counts.\nI don't pretend to understand all of your use case specifics, but allow me to imagine a scenario where the HllMap might make sense:  Suppose you have a potentially large graph with 100M nodes (perhaps IP addresses or Geo Where-on-earth IDs) and unique (user or edge) identifiers, which can be associated dynamically to a node in real time.  You would like to be able to monitor, also in real-time, the number of unique (user or edge) IDs that is associated with each node.  \nInstead of having a sketch at each node, you have a central server (which receives all the incoming traffic) which would contain a single HllMap.  Assume for simplicity, an identifier is a fixed length number (like an IP-address or a geo-identifier).  The HllMap is updated dynamically with each incoming node ID and user ID.  Since it is a map, you can query the HllMap at any time and get the unique count of user ID.  \nNow it is also possible to scan the entire map (in a single pass) at any time using a Quantiles Sketch and obtain the PMF or CDF distribution of Users per node.  You could also scan the map with the Frequent Items Sketch and get the list of IDs of the heavy-hitter nodes.\nThe economy of storage comes with the assumption that the distribution of edges (or users) per node is very skewed (as is usually the case with human traffic) and that the overhead of the machinery of the sketch is amortized because it is all in one instance.  Such an HllMap sketch would typically be large (on the order of a GB or so, but when you compute the cost per node it is far smaller than having a sketch per node.   In our applications with 100M nodes and our traffic distributions, after subtracting the storage required for the keys, the storage allocated for unique counting per node is about 10 bytes.   And the accuracy (RSE) (using this specific HllMap) is about 2.6%.  Which was more than good enough for our application.\n\nit seems that the length of the key must be fixed.\n\nYes it is true.  The HllMap was designed for fixed length keys (identifiers), which was critical for efficient map storage and speed.  You could use strings converted to bytes, assuming the string keys have a maximum length.  Having arbitrary length keys would make the entire HllMap much much larger and much slower.  \n\nHLlSketch seems to serialize to 73 bytes even if nothing has been added to it. \n\nThe HllSketch has a number of configuration options, but let me look into it.  I think it can be even smaller, but let me get back here with some specifics.\n. @gaffer01 \nOne more comment:\n\nIt is crucial for the serialization of a HLL which is almost empty to be very efficient.\n\nAbsolutely.  And this is how all of our sketches have been designed.\nAll of our sketches have a \"warm-up\" mode where the sketch starts out very small and grows larger only as required by the data.  An empty Theta Sketch is only 8 bytes stored.\nSome sketches reach a maximum size that is never exceeded (the (Theta, Sampling, and FrequentItems sketches), while others may not have a maximum size (Quantiles and HllMap).  The Quantile Sketch grows logarithmically and for most use cases is much smaller than a Theta Sketch, which has an upper bound in size.  The HllMap grows, of course, largely based on the number of keys. \nThe HllSketch starts out with a tiny hash table of \"coupons\" and then expands to the full HLL array only when it makes sense.  The HllMap also has a \"warm-up\" strategy that has multiple stages in order to keep the overall storage very efficient, but it's start-up size is considerably bigger than the other sketches.. @gaffer01\nI just noticed in your comment above that you may be assuming that the HllMap internally uses the same HllSketch available in the library.  It does not.  The form of the HLL sketch internally has been specially designed for this mapping application.  It is a bit too complex to describe here, but but of all the different HLL sketches in the library, the one in the HllMap is the most efficient during warmup ( I. E. When the unique counts are very small.  For example, early on, each entry adds only the key and 2 bytes for each new unique update.  . @gaffer01 \nI realized that my references above to HllMap should actually be referring to the enclosing class UniqueCountMap, which incorporates HllMap among other maps.  See code and Overview.  This is because within our team when we refer to the UniqueCountMap we call it the HllMap sketch because the key internal algorithm is HLL and it is a Map.   But the actual class that pulls it all together is the UniqueCountMap.   Sorry about the confusion, my mistake.. I want to return to your question about space usage and introduce some refinements in our terminology with respect to sketch size and memory space utilization.\nSketch size\nMost of our sketches have a configuration parameter k, or NominalEntries,  that affects both the memory requirements of the sketch as well as its accuracy.   k generally refers to the number of entries that the sketch needs to retain in order to guarantee related accuracy bounds.  The size of an entry however, depends on the chosen sketch.  For the Theta Sketches all update values are hashed to a 64-bit long, so an entry is 8 bytes. For the Quantiles, FrequentItems, and Sampling sketches an item can be some arbitrary object defined by the user. And since these objects are retained by the sketch, the overall memory consumed is directly dependent on the item size.\nUpdatable vs Compact (immutable) Memory Size\nMost of the sketches have (at least) two forms of internal data structures.  The Updatable form uses either a set of lists or a hash table that expands as required by incoming data and thus requires some extra overhead in space to enable high performance updating.  The Compact form is designed for read-only operations where no more updating of the sketch is anticipated.  In this form the extra space overhead required for an updating sketch can be eliminated.  Depending on the sketch, and the internal state, the Compact form can be half the size of the Updatable sketch. When multiplied by millions or billions of sketches being stored, a 50% savings is space required can be substantial.  Some of the sketches allow the user to specify during serialization, whether the resulting image is in the updatable or compact form.\nOn-heap vs Off-heap sketches.\nIn large system environments where a single machine can have 500GB RAM and 24 cores, much of that RAM space is often dedicated to memory-mapped files for fast query performance.  When the sketch image is stored off-heap it is usually in compact form, data only, which means there is no Java Object overhead included.  What remains in the Java heap is a \"Direct\" Sketch that is just a small shell wrapper that has a pointer to the off-heap sketch image of the data that it uses to query results.  \nCurrently only two of the sketch families, Theta and Quantiles, have off-heap (Direct) forms that actually can be updated off-heap.  Some of the other sketches can support operations via a \"heapify\" operation, which brings the off-heap data on-heap. \nNow back to the question about the serialization size of the HllSketch.  If an empty HllSketch has been compacted, it will serialize to 9 bytes.  If not compacted, (i.e., in updatable form) it serializes to 86 bytes.  This is because to be updatable it reserves space for 16 potential \"coupons\" (the temporary form of the HLL entries prior to the full HLL table being created) plus a few other registers required for the update process.  The first 11 or 12 entries just fill the potential coupon space thus the space required does not increase.  Meanwhile, if compacted, each of these entries add 4 bytes to the compact form.  So the stored, compacted images would have a size of 9, 13, 17, 21, ... bytes until the sketch converts to the full HLL array.  Then the size depends on the chosen logK for the sketch and whether the compressed form of the sketch (4-bit buckets) or naive dense form (8-bit buckets) is chosen.  \nI hope this helps.\n. @gaffer01 \nWhat you are asking for, the ability to union two compact sketches, is reasonable and is currently possible with the Theta Sketches,  but is a bit more complicated with the current HLL sketches.     \nThe HLL sketches were designed several years ago, and haven't received much use or attention primarily because HLL sketches lack the set flexibility and speed of the theta sketches, lack good documentation and are more difficult to use.  Largely based on your interest and feedback here, we have decided to rewrite the HLL code, simplify its use, make the API more parallel to the other sketches, and incorporate some more advanced estimators that will make them more accurate as well.   The completion of this will be probably a few months out.  \nMeanwhile, you could help us understand your computational environment in order to make sure your use-case is considered as we trade-off the various parameters that determine sketch performance.  For example, you mention that you serialize and store your sketches in some secondary key-value store...    So what are the performance bottlenecks for sketches in this key-value store?  Serialization time, or storage space, etc ? What about on-heap: update time, merge time or serialization time or on-heap space? Your choice of HLL, leads me to think that serialized storage space is your biggest concern and not update time, merge time or serialization time.  Is this correct?    I also gather that set expressions are not of much interest, as they are not practical with HLL sketches and are addressed with the Theta Sketches.\n. @gaffer01 \nThis is very helpful insight into your requirements.\n\ncompact serialization for the low cardinality case is particularly important.\n\nWe agree, and we have taken great pains to make this true.\n\nIdeally the sketch should provide accurate estimates for both low cardinalities and high cardinalities.\n\nFor all sketches (HLL, Theta, Frequent Items, Quantiles, Sampling) the accuracy estimates for low number of entries are better than when the sketches transition into full estimation mode.  In fact,  in most cases, the estimation errors are zero up to some threshold, which is a function of the configured k.  HLL is more complex as it has multiple estimators based on cardinality zones.  The lowest zone (up to a cardinality of about 8 or 16 has practically zero error. \n\nIt's worth noting that for large-scale graphs a small sketch size might be chosen at the expense of accuracy, i.e. prioritize small serialized size over the accuracy of the sketch.\n\nTwo comments here. \n\n\nBe careful.  If you choose a small k for large-scale graphs and a larger k for small-scale graphs ... AND you wish to be able to merge these sketches together the resulting accuracy will always be determined by the small k.   There are some subtle exceptions to this (but not with HLL).  So if merging of mixed k sketches is very common, you may as well choose space or accuracy to determine k, and stick with it for all scales.\n\n\nIf you have millions to billions of sketches in storage and you are concerned about the aggregate storage of all these sketches, AND your cardinality distribution is power-law, you might consider using the p-sampling option of the Theta Sketches.  This allows you to reduce the aggregate storage of all the sketches by factors of ~ 1/p, and maintain the same accuracy for the largest cardinality sketches (but the accuracy of queries against the smallest nodes can be considerably worse).  This works well if you can make the assumption that your queries are mostly concerned with the big guys.  We have experimented with p values as low as 0.1 (thus total space is reduce by about 10) with good results for the vast majority of queries.  With these assumptions, Theta Sketches in aggregate, can consume less space than HLL sketches.  But you will have to experiment with your actual data distributions and query distributions to see if this works for you or not.\n\n\n\nIf the HLL implementation could be extended so that it allowed merging of the compact sketches, that would make it a lot more useful for this application.\n\nThat is always the plan.\n\nPresumably by \"advanced estimators\" you're referring to the improvements in the HyperLogLog++ paper?\n\nThe HLL++ papers refer to compressing the HLL encoding array down to 4-bits, which can be done several ways.  But we haven't found any really good (or correct) implementations out there.  We have come up with what we think is superior in many ways to the HLL++ paper, both in terms of accuracy, size and speed performance.  We also leverage the HIP estimator, when appropriate, which was proposed by Edith Cohen a few years ago.  We also have developed advanced estimators for the low and intermediate cardinality zones that has not yet been published (coming soon). \n\nOne use case for the theta sketches would be to understand the evolution of the graph over time.\n\nThis is what we call retention analysis, and we have it in production in many of our systems, where the time interval resolution is often hours, days, weeks or months, chosen by the user.\nOne application you didn't mention, which we have used to great success, is near-real-time use of sketching.  We currently have systems deployed with real-time query results within seconds of real time.\n. No Problem. Working hard on new HLL impl, will let you know when it is ready for you to try out.. @gaffer01\nThe new HLL code is now in sketches-core/master in the com.yahoo.sketches.hll package.  I suggest that you clone & jar it yourself.  You will also need to pull in the new memory repository. This is in pre-release form but it should be good for testing.  \nIt is a little short on documentation and we are doing characterization testing on it now.\nWe would like you to test it out and feedback to us what is good  and bad, what works and what doesn't \nCheers and thank you for volunteering to do this!\n. @gaffer01 \nThank you!   This is really excellent feedback!  I will respond to each of your points:\n\n\n& 2. Yes. Internally, the sketch starts as a simple list of \"coupons\", then transitions to a hash table of coupons, then at ~ 3/4 * 2^(log2(k) - 3), which is about 10% of k, transitions to the full HLL array, which thereafter is constant in size (except for the 4-bit version, which in very very rare cases might need to grow a few percent.  The word \"coupon\" comes from the famous \"Coupon Collector Problem\", which is very close to how an HLL sketch behaves early on.  Our coupons are 4 bytes each.\n\n\n& 4. Not perfect, but better than anything in the literature.  This is our new estimator for the HLL low range.  The RSE is less than 50 ppm and is independent of K and independent of the Target HLL Type.  BTW, the accuracy for all 3 types is the same for the same LgK, as they are all isomorphic to each other.  The accuracy of unioning is also independent of the incoming sketch type, and you can union sketches of different lgK.\n\n\nNo way to deserialize a union. Oops!  This is an omission! (This is why this is pre-release :) )\n\n\nThe generally accepted practice for rating a sketch is to measure its accuracy per byte of required storage.  So I could argue that comparing a sketch with a lgK = 4 against a sketch of lgK = 7 is a bit misleading and difficult to make sense of.  However, I think I understand why you were motivated to do it this way.  We can certainly look at extending the low range down to 4, but would you actually use a sketch with an RSE of 25% error? Or more practically, 50% error with 95% confidence?  \n\n\nIf you don't mind, the next time you run this, try the two sketches, both with LgK = 7.\n\n\nThe large error at 100K, I can't explain.  It might be a bug, but we will definitely look into it.\n\n\nWhen feeding stings into the DS, there is a feature you could leverage.  First convert the string to a char[] and feed the char[] to the sketch.  This avoids the expensive UTF_8 encoding in Java.\n\n\nWe will fix the javadoc.\n\n\nYou found a bug.  Thanks!\n. One more question.  When running your tests, are you averaging over multiple trials?  For example, run 10K trials of 100K uniques, each trial with a different set of uniques.  . @gaffer01 \n\n\nCool, thanks!  It really helps us to understand how these are being used.  \nIn the next day or so, we will do a major release, which will include the improvements you suggested for the HLL sketches.  Most significantly for HLL, it can now be configured with a lgK down to 4.  The Javadocs have been improved and the bug you found fixed.   \nThe scope of this release is large impacting a number of areas of the library.  In the following week we will be updating the web-site, so stay tuned.. @gaffer01 \nThe new sketches-core_0.10.0 has been released to Maven Central.  Please see the release notes and the web-site for more documentation (which will be rolling out over the next few days).. @gaffer01 \nThis is great feedback, thank you!  I will make some comments and try to answer the questions you have:\n\nFor any sketch that we use we need to be able to serialise it to a byte array for storage. Later we need to be able to deserialise it (a) back to the sketch to obtain whatever estimates the sketch provides, (b) to merge it with another deserialised sketch. Of course this serialisation and deserialisation can be relatively expensive, but as some of our stores (e.g. the Accumulo and Hbase ones) are designed for large-scale storage, it is not always viable to leave the sketches in memory. Streaming jobs can be used to aggregate sketches over a time window before they are serialised and stored, but the requirement to deserialise them later and possibly merge with other sketches of the same type remains.\n\nSketch uses after deserialization.  You mentioned (a) get estimate and (b) merging, but you didn't mention (c) continue updating the sketch.  Do you ever have this 3rd use case?  If so, and depending on the sketch, one must pay attention to the serialized form.  More on this later if you need it.\nSerialization & deserialization costs.  What I can't tell from your comments is your requirements on query latency.  We also have massive data that has been stored in sketch form (on disk) that goes back several years.  Based on the breadth and depth of the query, of course, even in sketch form it can sometimes take a minute (from a Hadoop environment) to bring the relevant sketches (sometimes millions) into memory so they can be merged with more recent sketches.  Still, careful profiling of the queries and staging of history allows us to keep more than 95% of the query latencies under a second.  \nThis query latency is also very sensitive to the design of your back-end store.  While Hadoop (HBase) offers large distributed storage, for some of our most critical latency requirements we find HBase too slow.   For our real-time systems, we use a combination of Storm and Druid.  A typical Druid cluster might have 100 nodes, each node with 256- 512GB RAM and 48 hyperthreads.  All of this RAM is used for data and the JVM, which acts as a supervisor, may only be 8GB. The data in RAM is paged in as required from SSDs. This is where the Memory package from our library comes into play.  So far, two of our sketches, Theta and Quantiles, take full advantage of this by being able to operate directly from off-heap memory.  (We will be adding an Direct (or off-heap) extension to the HLL sometime soon.).  This largely eliminates the need to be constantly serializing and deserializing the sketches.  It takes quite a bit of care and engineering at the system level to make this all work, but the real-time query results are truly amazing. In this environment we routinely merge millions of sketches and provide sub-second query latency.  \n\nQuestion: Would it be more efficient to use the static method unionImpl on Union to merge the two Unions (but this method is not public so presumably it is not intended to be used by external code)?\n\nThere is no UnionImpl method in the HLL Union. Perhaps you captured a pre-release version that had that method (perhaps I called it that at one point, but now it is called 'gadget').   Nonetheless, the non-public members behind the HLL Union must not be directly accessed by users for good reasons,  one of which is that these members can be swapped out entirely during the unioning process, so attempting to keep a link to these private members would be futile.  And no, it would not be faster, and even if you could make it work, it could be catastrophically slower.\n\nIt seems that there is no toByteArray directly on Union, unlike the reservoir sampling package?\n\nI will talk to my colleague who worked on this and get back to you.  We had a good reason, I just don't recall at the moment the details.\nThe rest of your use-cases seem well thought out.  . @gaffer01 \n\nI was looking at the unionImpl static method on line 199 of https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-core/blob/sketches-core-0.10.0/src/main/java/com/yahoo/sketches/hll/Union.java, but you've answered my question anyway thanks.\n\nI am red-faced on this one, and I wrote it!  \nThis static method examines the state of the current internal gadget and the incoming sketch and determines the optimum way to perform the union. This may involve swapping, down-sampling, transforming, and / or copying one of the arguments and may completely replace the internals of the union.  \nThe result is always in HLL_8 form, which may not be what the user wants. In general, it is not safe for a user to have a reference to the internal data structures, which could be changed by the user, or the reference may get completely replaced by later union operations.   \n. @gaffer01 \nI want to let you know that our HLL sketch has now be extended to enable full off-heap operation. The javadocs are pretty much complete, but I will be adding more documentation to the DataSketches.github.io website over the next few weeks.\nBTW, I will be presenting a paper at the ACM IMC-2017 conference in London, November 1-3.\nIf you would like, I can come and do a talk for your team on sketching technology while I'm in London.  It can be completely customized to your interests. (It doesn't have to be the same talk I will be doing for the IMC) . Please let me know if this would be of interest, and how we can communicate to exchange planning and logistical information that really is not relevant for this issues forum.  \nCheers.\n. @gaffer01 \nI will be in London and have time available on Tuesday, Oct 31st.  I will be at the ACM ICM 2017 conference Wed thru Friday.\nI would be interested in doing a talk or just an informal feedback session on features of interest to you.

Could you help us understand why you are associating union objects instead of sketch objects with your vertices or edges? Unions are typically larger than sketches. In case of HLL family, unions are always in 8-bit mode, but sketches can be in 4-bit mode, which is the most compact mode, and is the default mode.\nIn case of Theta family, Union contains an UpdateSketch as its internal state. Do you update your vertices and edges? If not, the associated Theta sketch can be in the compact form.\nBy the way, the Theta family has PairwiseSetOperations if you just want to produce a union of two sketches as opposed to performing a massive union operation on thousands or millions of sketches, for which Unions are designed.. > In the first approach, we need to call getResult() once and update once. In the second we need to create a new Union, call update twice and then call getResult().\nThe first update of an empty union is simple.

You can do this by using addInputMapperPair(inputPath, mapperGeneratorClassName) or adding multiple as a map; addInputMapperPairs(Map inputPath, mapperGeneratorClassName).. we will need to have multiple sections in the json:\n\"auth1\": {\n\"start\": \n\"end\": \n...\n},\n\"auth2\": {\n\"start\": \n\"end\": \n...\n},\nThe map would need to be ordered so it would need to be a LinkedHashMap and then you would have to start at the top and find the first auth that a user has and use the start, end operations from that section.. # Migration Steps\nAll Element groups must now match a specific regex.  Groups can only contain alpha numeric characters and pipes (|).\nThe same applies for all Element properties.  The regex that must be matched is the same, alpha numeric characters and pipes.\nImportant if you have a group name that isn't currently alpha numeric (including pipes) this will break your existing data in Accumulo and HBase. If this is the case for you, please get in touch and we can provide you with advice on migrating your data.. # Migration Notes\nAll Spark RDD Operations now require a SparkSession instead of specific contexts.  When creating any of these Operations the constructor will now use a SparkSession.\nThis means when doing any Operations through the AbstractGetRDDHandler, the Operation passed in to the handler will now contain the SparkSession.. # Migration Steps\nAll new and current Operation implementations must implement a ShallowClone method.  This method should perform a shallow clone that will create a new instance and copies the fields across.  It should not fully clone the fields.. Spoken to @p013570 who has said the canHandle should contain the equals method instead of isAssignableFrom, I have updated this for the TreeSetSerialiser too.. This will be added to the FAQs page after the federated store. . Merged into develop.. Closed for fixes\n. Closing for fixes. Closed until the visibility filter is added to GetElementsAsDataFrame.. # Migration Steps\nFor any Operation that implements the MapReduce.java interface, the builder used addinputMapperPair but has now been corrected to addInputMapperPair.\nWhen using this addinputMapperPair, all usages must be updated to addInputMapperPair.. In regards to the new requirement, this has been added.  If there is no cache class string set in the properties it will not use any cache and continue to work as it did before.  Also, the merging of Schema Id's and StoreProperties Id's has been addressed in https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1431 and merged into this branch.  Tests have also been added on that branch.. Closing for tests fixes. The same exists for Schemas.  Currently addSchema also takes an id, and the Schema that is added contains an id field.  They will clash and could differ with unexpected id's being stored.. Merged into develop. I have just looked through these tests and there is only two Mockito uses, both of which are needed and act correctly.  I don't think there is anything to do on this.. So I think we should add a method within Graph that will update the graphId before the Schema or StoreProperties are updated.  This graphId can then be used within the updateStoreProperties() and updateSchema() (in the Schema.Builder merge method) to set the id's, using the graphId.  This will solve the issue within Graph, although the issue will still remain if a Schema or StoreProperties is added to a graph library not related to a Graph.. Logic has been updated to merge schema/storeProperties ID's rather than set them to null and then allow the GraphLibrary to deal with the null ID (which will then use the graph ID).  This is because a schema/storeProperties can be merged and added to a GraphLibrary without the use of a graph.  This would then throw an IllegalArgumentException as the ID is null.. I think there is a bug in the logic of min and max reducers.  If a max is set it will default to using all the max reducers.  If the max and min is set it should surely try and find the correct number of reducers (based on the tablets) and then correct itself based on the min/max set, not just default to using as many as possible up to the max.  This could end up not being efficient, adding a small amount of data with a large maximum, a large amount of unnecessary task creation.. # Migration Steps\nThere is no breaking change and no immediate migration required, however setting the specific number of reduce tasks in an addElementsToHdfs Job has been reduced, and we recommend you set the min and/or max number of reduce tasks instead.  This will allow Accumulo to choose the right number of reducers for the task.. Closed whilst waiting for css for banner.. Need to check on the catch(Exception e) from the put method in GraphStorage that no Schema info can be leaked.. This should have been fixed as part of https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1497.  The default value's have been removed from the html, and are loaded as a default property value instead.. closing for fixes.. Closing for additional documentation. Merged into parent branch #1542.. Merged into parent branch #1542.. Merged into parent branch #1542.. \nNamedViews\nThe code for this example is NamedViews.\nThis example explains how to configure your Gaffer Graph to allow NamedViews to be used. Named views enable encapsulation of a View, or multiple Views, into a new single NamedView. A NamedView can be used in conjunction with other Views. There are various possible uses for NamedViews, including:\n\nMaking it simpler to reuse frequently used Views.\nShare commonly used Views with other users.\n\nIn addition to the NamedView there are a set of operations which manage named views (AddNamedView, GetAllNamedViews, DeleteNamedView).\nConfiguration\nYou will need to configure what cache to use for storing NamedViews. For more information on the cache service, see Cache.\nUsing Named Views\nPlease note; If you want to change the region for NamedViews you can do so by specifying it within the cache.ccf file using region jcs.region.namedViewsRegion.\nWe will now go through some examples using NamedViews.\nWe will use the same basic schema and data from the first developer walkthrough.\nStart by creating your user instance and graph:\nfinal User user = new User(\"user01\");\nfinal Graph graph = new Graph.Builder()\n        .config(getDefaultGraphConfig())\n        .addSchemas(StreamUtil.openStreams(getClass(), schemaPath))\n        .storeProperties(getDefaultStoreProperties())\n        .build();\nThen add a NamedView to the cache with the AddNamedView operation:\n```\nfinal AddNamedView addNamedView = new AddNamedView.Builder()\n        .name(\"RoadUse edges\")\n        .description(\"NamedView to get only RoadUse edges\")\n        .view(new View.Builder()\n                .edge(\"RoadUse\")\n                .build())\n        .overwrite(false)\n        .build();\ngraph.execute(addNamedView, user);\n```\nFor the next step we need to create a GetElements operation and use the NamedView previously added to the cache, using the name specified. After this we can execute it:\n```\nfinal GetElements operation = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .view(new NamedView.Builder()\n                .name(\"RoadUse edges\")\n                .build())\n        .input(new EntitySeed(\"10\"))\n        .build();\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> namedViewResults = graph.execute(operation, user);\nThe results are:\nEdge[source=10,destination=11,directed=true,matchedVertex=SOURCE,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Mon May 01 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=2,startDate=Mon May 01 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\nEdge[source=10,destination=11,directed=true,matchedVertex=SOURCE,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Tue May 02 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=1,startDate=Tue May 02 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\nEdge[source=11,destination=10,directed=true,matchedVertex=DESTINATION,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Wed May 03 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=1,startDate=Wed May 03 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\n```\nNamedViews can also take parameters, allowing values to be configured by the user when the NamedView is used. When adding a NamedView with parameters the View must be specified as a JSON string, with parameter names enclosed with '${' and '}'. For each parameter, a ViewParameterDetail object must be created which gives a description, a class type and an optional default for the Parameter, and also indicates whether the parameter must be provided (ie. there is no default).\nThe following code adds a NamedView with a 'countIsMoreThan' parameter that allows the minimum edge count for the View to be set, along with a 'selectionParam' parameter that allows the user to set the selection for the View:\nString viewString = \"{\" +\n        \"      \\\"edges\\\" : {\" +\n        \"        \\\"RoadUse\\\" : {  \" +\n        \"           \\\"preAggregationFilterFunctions\\\" : [ {\" +\n        \"               \\\"predicate\\\" : {\" +\n        \"                   \\\"class\\\" : \\\"uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.predicate.IsMoreThan\\\",\" +\n        \"                   \\\"orEqualTo\\\" : false,\" +\n        \"                     \\\"value\\\": {\" +\n        \"                         \\\"java.lang.Long\\\" : \\\"${isMoreThanParam}\\\"\" +\n        \"                       }\" +\n        \"                 },\" +\n        \"             \\\"selection\\\" : [ \\\"${selectionParam}\\\" ]\" +\n        \"         } ] }\" +\n        \"      },\" +\n        \"      \\\"entities\\\" : { }\" +\n        \"}\";\n```\nViewParameterDetail param = new ViewParameterDetail.Builder()\n        .description(\"Selection param\")\n        .valueClass(String.class)\n        .required(true)\n        .build();\nViewParameterDetail param1 = new ViewParameterDetail.Builder()\n        .description(\"isMoreThan param\")\n        .defaultValue(0L)\n        .valueClass(Long.class)\n        .build();\nMap paramDetailMap = Maps.newHashMap();\nparamDetailMap.put(\"selectionParam\", param);\nparamDetailMap.put(\"isMoreThanParam\", param1);\nfinal AddNamedView addNamedViewWithParams = new AddNamedView.Builder()\n        .name(\"customCountView\")\n        .description(\"named View with count param\")\n        .view(viewString)\n        .parameters(paramDetailMap)\n        .overwrite(false)\n        .build();\ngraph.execute(addNamedViewWithParams, user);\nA view can then be created, with a value provided for the 'countIsMoreThan' and 'selectionParam' parameter:\nMap paramMap = Maps.newHashMap();\nparamMap.put(\"selectionParam\", \"count\");\nparamMap.put(\"isMoreThanParam\", 1L);\nfinal GetElements operationUsingParams = new GetElements.Builder()\n        .view(new NamedView.Builder()\n                .name(\"customCountView\")\n                .parameters(paramMap)\n                .build())\n        .input(new EntitySeed(\"10\"))\n        .build();\nand executed:\nfinal CloseableIterable<? extends Element> namedViewResultsWithParams = graph.execute(operationUsingParams, user);\ngiving these results:\nEdge[source=10,destination=11,directed=true,matchedVertex=SOURCE,group=RoadUse,properties=Properties[endDate=Mon May 01 23:59:59 BST 2000,count=2,startDate=Mon May 01 00:00:00 BST 2000]]\n```\n. All looks good. This is a duplicate of #1833 . This ticket has now been split into two branches, gh-1657-loader-tests and gh-1657-flink-IT-tests.  This is because there has been issues with the ITs in the flink library.  When gh-1657-loader-tests has been merged https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1833 can go ahead using the TestSchema class.. There is still gh-1657-flink-IT-tests branch to fix under this ticket.. This seems to be a bigger ticket than originally thought.  We should use this to update the KeyPackages, possibly using a new field to specify where the group is stored.  We should then use this within the methods in the ElementConverter to get the groups, therefore not relying on the group to always be equal to the ColumnFamily.. Rather than using the current Builder classes it would be simpler to add builder methods such as:\nWe have already added a few to the User class. Essentially just add some methods in the form:\n```java\npublic class Pojo {\n    private String x;\n    private String y;\npublic Pojo x(final String x) {\n    this.x = x;\n    return this;\n}\n\npublic Pojo y(final String y) {\n    this.y = y;\n    return this;\n}\n\n}\n```\nThe Pojo class can then be initialised like:\njava\nPojo pojo = new Pojo().x(\"value of x\").y(\"value of y\");\n. This has been completed, waiting for Koryphe version update.. This has been completed, waiting for Koryphe version update.. After discussion, we are going to expose the Koryphe and Gaffer versions through the /properties endpoint.  The Gaffer version will be visible in the footer in the Swagger UI but the Koryphe version will only be available through the /properties endpoint.  This will allow users to see what methods are/aren't available to them through their versions.. Closing for tests to be added.. Changes made look good to me. Looks good. # Migration Notes\nThe default for seedMatching is RELATED so if that is currently used nothing will need to change.  There is one limitation however, if you have a seedMatching = EQUAL and specify both Edges and Entities that will have to now be done under 2 Operations in a chain as there can only be one View applied globally to all input.\nAs seedMatching is now deprecated to write an equivalent Operation for Edges it should now be written as below:\nOLD:\n{\n   \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetElements\",\n    \"seedMatching\": \"EQUAL\",\n      \"input\": [\n      {\n         \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.data.EdgeSeed\",\n         \"source\": \u201csource1\u201c,\n         \"destination\": \u201cdest1\u201c,\n         \"directed\": \"true\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\nNEW:\n{\n   \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetElements\u201d,\n      \"input\": [\n      {\n         \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.data.EdgeSeed\",\n         \"source\": \u201csource1\u201c,\n         \"destination\": \u201cdest1\u201d,\n         \"directed\": \"true\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"view\" : {\n    \"edges\": {\n      \u201cgroup1\u201c:{}\n    }\n  }\n}\nFor entities it should now be written:\nOLD:\n{\n   \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetElements\",\n    \"seedMatching\": \"EQUAL\",\n      \"input\": [\n      {\n         \"class\": \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.data.EntitySeed\",\n         \"vertex\": \u201cvertex1\u201d\n      }\n   ]\n}\nNEW:\n{\n  \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetElements\",\n  \"input\" : [ {\n    \"class\" : \"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.data.EntitySeed\",\n    \"vertex\" : \u201cvertex1\u201d\n  } ],\n  \"view\" : {\n    \"entities\": {\n      \u201cgroup1\u201c: {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n. We cannot update the signature as the methods are public, so new ordered methods have been created and the old ones deprecated, as mentioned above.. The Sets have been updated to Lists and made immutable.. Closing for fixes.. Merged into Develop.. Reopened for missing handler\n. Some thought has been put into this about what will be returned when.  Using examples with a simple POJO, it is possible to see what is expected.\nINPUTS:\nLeft: [new TestPojo(1, 3), new TestPojo(2, 4), new TestPojo(2, 4), new TestPojo(3, 5), new TestPojo(4, 6)]\nRight: [new TestPojo(2, 4), new TestPojo(4, 6), new TestPojo(4, 11), new TestPojo(6, 8), new TestPojo(8, 10)]\nJOINS:\nInnerJoinFromLeft matching only on field 1:\n[{TestPojo(2, 4)=[TestPojo(2, 4)]}, {TestPojo(2, 4)=[TestPojo(2, 4)]},{TestPojo(4, 6)=[TestPojo(4, 6),TestPojo(4, 11)]}]\nInnerJoinFromRight matching only on field 1:\n[{TestPojo(2, 4)=[TestPojo(2, 4),TestPojo(2, 4)]},{TestPojo(4, 6)=[TestPojo(4, 6)]},{TestPojo(4, 11)=[TestPojo(4, 6)]}]\nFullOuterJoin matching fully:\n[{TestPojo(1, 3)=[]},{TestPojo(3, 5)=[]},{TestPojo(6, 8)=[]},{TestPojo(8, 10)=[]},{TestPojo(4, 11)=[]}}]\nLeftOuterJoin matching fully:\n[{TestPojo(1, 3)=[]},{TestPojo(3, 5)=[]}]\nRightOuterJoin matching fully:\n[{TestPojo(4, 11)=[]},{TestPojo(6, 8)=[]},{TestPojo(8, 10)=[]}]\nLeftInnerJoin matching fully:\n[{TestPojo(1, 3)=[]},{TestPojo(2, 4)=[TestPojo(2, 4)]},{TestPojo(2, 4)=[TestPojo(2, 4)]},{TestPojo(3, 5)=[]},{TestPojo(4, 6)=[TestPojo(4, 6)]}]\nRightInnerJoin matching fully:\n[{TestPojo(2, 4)=[TestPojo(2, 4),TestPojo(2, 4)]},{TestPojo(4, 6)=[TestPojo(4, 6)]},{TestPojo(4, 11)=[]},{TestPojo(6, 8)=[]},{TestPojo(8, 10)=[]}]. This isn't feasible.  There are several methods used from external classes in which this Exception is thrown.  We can't update the method signatures so unchecked exceptions must still be thrown.. Reopened for since annotation update.. Merged into Develop.. This is currently at a stage where parameters need to be reviewed/reworked for this to work.  It will work now in certain cases but not all can be guaranteed.  The issue with deserialising unresolved parameters still stands.  We have the option of leaving this as is and giving users the ability to use variables within a json opChain, or waiting for a fix for using the variables within the Java.. Merged into develop.. Merged into #1860 . Merged into #1860 . Merged into #1860 . To be merged after 1.7 release. Merged into Develop.. Closing for fixes.. Closing for fixes.. To be merged after #1934 and #1936 . Closing for fixes.. Hi @g609bmsma.  So Having a think about this we have 2 options that I can think of.  Move the GetElementsBetweenSets Op to the store package, or we implement our own GetWalks handler within the Accumulo Store.  I think Logically it makes more sense to implement the latter, and implement a new handler which will be the same as the updated one with your code in but in the Accumulo store package.  Then tests will need to be added for this using GetElements and GetElementsBetweenSets.. A better way to do this would just add an extra initialise method to the Store to take a boolean to add the core opHandlers.  By default we leave this to true, but then within the ProxyStore you just call initialise with false and the store will not add any core handlers.  This will be a lot smaller and easier change.. I am going to close this discussion.. Closing for fixes.. this will be completed under #1657 . To be merged after Koryphe version updated with updated Guava version. This is now at a stage of consistently working, apart from ParquetSchemaHidingIT which fails due to aggregation, which is a known bug.  A skip for these tests needed then should be good to merge.. The federated store tests fail due to invalid Edges, this will need to be fixed by adding direction bits as discussed.. Related to #1836 . Hi @benj-fletch, thanks very much for the contribution.  I have just noticed the Travis-CI build has failed on your test, this will need to be fixed before it can be merged, thanks!. Hi @benj-fletch, just had a read quickly and the ticket is to check the snapshot path does exist, however your fix currently checks it does not exist.  Just on another note you need to use an if round the exists method, this will currently fail on an IOException which is not how you want to test the existence of the directory.  Let me know if you need anymore direction and I can add some change suggestions.  \nEDIT: sorry just also can we add a test to check this passes when the directory does exist, as well as an exception test for when it doesn't.  Thanks. @benj-fletch thanks very much for that, looks great.  Just one small issue with the IOException catch then it should be good to go.  Thanks again for the contribution, and feel free to pick anything else up unassigned :). Your above comment was considered when it was implemented but users may want to use a null value (for whatever reason) and this provides a way to do this without a flag.  Also further flags makes it a lot harder to use nulls within JSON OperationChains using Variables (which is the final goal for these Variables tickets), again something we don't want to limit users to.. @benj-fletch No problem, thanks for the contribution again :). \ud83d\udc4d . Merged into develop.. Closing for fixes.. Unreliable tests need fixing.. @EmekeN This has now been passed on as we would like this in the next release. @c015dariu.. Branch relating to this is develop-2.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. Hi @benj-fletch.  What we are looking to do it remove the Store specific StoreProperties class in favour of one single class, as you said.  StoreProperties should not really change.  A StorePropertiesUtil class should also be added to the store package, which will contain the Strings for properties out of the StoreProperties class and any 'top level' helper methods.  Each Store implementation will now have their own implementation of StorePropertiesUtil class, and then can just use a StoreProperties.\nPackage structure will look something like this:\nSTORE PACKAGE\nStoreProperties.java (containing just map)\nStorePropertiesUtil.java (containing 'top level' constants and their helpers)\nOTHER STORE IMPLEMENTATION PACKAGES\nOtherStorePropertiesUtil.java (extends StorePropertiesUtil and adds their own store specific constants and helpers). Hi @benj-fletch, no I dont think there is any reason we don't extend that, sounds like a good idea.  Thanks!. This will be merged into develop-2.. Merged into develop-2.. merged into develop.. So I wrote this method and added it in, however the reason this ticket is blocked and it is commented out is that it is a breaking change, as for users who have schemas without direction validation currently, it would throw an exception and require direction.  We cannot make breaking changes on minor versions so it will have to wait until V2, however feel free to create a branch and re add this method back in, and add a unit test, and when we get to the point of V2 we can merge it back in. \nEDIT - For more context see https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1980. We can't currently assign to you but feel free to pick it up.  When it's done just open the PR and I will have a read through.  If you're struggling at all let me know here and I can help.  You will need to sign the CLA when you open the PR. Thanks. Hi, so for the getTestObject method yeah just put a new instance of the class.\nFor example with the NamedOperationResolver GraphHook It will look something like this (obviously with the other current tests in there too):\npublic class NamedOperationResolverTest extends GraphHookTest<NamedOperationResolver> {\n      public NamedOperationResolverTest() {\n            super(NamedOperationResolver.class);\n      }\n      @Override\n      protected NamedOperationResolver getTestObject() {\n           return new NamedOperationResolver();\n      }\n}\nFor the shouldHaveJsonPropertyAnnotation test method to work this line will need to be added to the GraphHook class:\n@JsonPropertyOrder(alphabetic = true)\nYou can go ahead and add these lines within this ticket.\nNot sure what you mean about the Log4jlogger bits, I've just tested and it seems to be alright using the same implementation as above.\nThanks very much for this, let me know if there are any other issues.. Closing for fixes.. This will be merged into branch:develop-2 and then all the features will be merged in after the 1.8 release.\n. Merged into develop-2.. This will be merged into branch:develop-2 and then all the features will be merged in after the 1.8 release.. Merged into develop-2.. Just noticed also there is a checkstyle issue with your code somewhere.  If you run mvn clean install -Panalyze it will fail on the checkstyle issue and you can fix it.  They are normally quite useful errors but any problems let me know.. I have stopped the build due to this branch failing on a checkstyle issue with your code. If you run mvn clean install -Panalyze it will show you the issue. They are normally quite useful errors but any problems let me know.. So these Validators and optimisers should be completely removed from the Store.  The OperationChainHandler should now implement the OperationValidation interface and then implement its own prepareOperation method using the classes own OperationChainValidator and Optimisers.. This has been done as part of #2080 but the fields will need removing in V2, and possibly some slight logic changing.. Merged into develop.. Merged into develop.. View validation for empty/null views can't be added in the Graph class, as this will introduce large breaking changes to the FederatedStore (and others).. Merged into develop.. This will be done as part of develop-2.. This is not going to be done.  The OperationValidation interface can be implemented by the Handlers themselves.. Closing for fixing.. Hi @c015dariu, yeah this is just as simple as copying the variables over on a shallowClone. Thanks.\nEDIT: Can you add one test, something like shouldShallowCloneContext() and just assert they are not the same but equal.  Something like this:\n```\n@Test\n    public void shouldShallowCloneContext() {\n        // Given\n        final User user = new User(\"user\");\n        final String testConf = \"testConf\";\n        final Context context = new Context.Builder()\n                .user(user)\n                .config(testConf, \"testConfVal\")\n                .variable(\"testVar\", \"testVarVal\")\n                .build();\n    // When\n    Context clonedContext = context.shallowClone();\n\n    // Then\n    assertNotSame(context, clonedContext);\n    assertEquals(context.getUser(), clonedContext.getUser());\n    assertEquals(context.getExporters().toString(),\n            clonedContext.getExporters().toString());\n    assertEquals(context.getConfig(testConf), clonedContext.getConfig(testConf));\n    assertEquals(context.getVariables(), clonedContext.getVariables());\n}\n\n```\nNote;\n- Can't test full equality due to diff jobIds\n- Can't test Exporters without toString due to not implementing Equals methods\n- Check one config, if works we can assume its cloned correctly. Just FYI this milestone has been update to 1.9 due to an urgent bugfix release for 1.8.1 required and a workaround for this issue makes it less critical.. Merged into develop.. Sorry @c015dariu, just added a comment to the ticket.  Shouldn't be long.. Ah good spot.  Even deprecated it should have been added to the builder correctly.  Cheers.. Ah yeah, it's missing the \"this\".  Cheers for that.. So when the class is json serialised within the input, if you use an entity for example, the Entity class will show 2 times.. As discussed, leaving this for now as the schema folder contains several different files when only a subset are required.. This is tested within the GetRDDOfElementsHandlerTest.testNoSparkContext()?. This equals method should match Apache Commons Lang 3 style.  See https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/864. I have created a new issue for this, it will be done in #1002 . isDebug cannot be null as it is a boolean.  The idea of it setting on checkDebugMode() stops a user having to run updateDebugMode() then isInDebugMode() every time in case it changes or is set somewhere after the last time it has been updated.. Should this not be completely removed to stop users initialising an AccumuloStore with a graphId of the table name but possibly not realising they have done it?  Same for HBaseStore.. Possibly neater to create private static methods, as in AddUpdateTableIterator to retrieve the args values.  Also makes it a lot easier to read.. Within loadStoreProperties when the input stream is opened it will throw the error if there is no such file.  Also if it is empty does that matter? It may intentionally not have any properties in, and just return an empty Properties? I have added a test for a properties file that doesn't exist.. If we are using rtn as the returned object above can we stick with it here? Also applies to resoveSchema below.. Could we add all the validate to the validationHandling to just make one validate method?\nThis would also avoid the use of calling export.getX() twice as this is already done in the createGraph method once.. Does it delete after each test or end of all? This will affect the way the tests run.. This was originally like that, as described above, but to limit the usage of calls we decided to pass individual variables.  I don't disagree with this though.\n. This should match the ACL style:\n@Override\n    public boolean equals(final Object obj) {\n        if (this == obj) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    final MyObject myObj = (MyObject) obj;\n\n    return new EqualsBuilder()\n            .append(field1, myObj.field1)\n            .append(field2, myObj.field2)\n            .isEquals();\n}\n\n. See above comment:\n@Override\npublic int hashCode() {\n    return new HashCodeBuilder(17, 37)\n            .append(field1)\n            .append(field2)\n            .toHashCode();\n}\n\n. Header template? It is mentioned already, not sure if you planned to update them.. just reuse input: \n.input(input). You can use getErrorString() and do an assertTrue.  Bit easier to read:\nassertTrue(validationResult.getErrorString().contains(\"requiredField2 is required\"));. formatting?. formatting again?\n. And again here. Better to add StoreException to this rather than generalise.. Better to be specific with:\nthrows StoreException, OperationException, IOException. Specify again with:\ncatch (final IOException | StoreException | OperationException e) . There is an OverwritingException that can be thrown?. Could we possibly rename this to federatedSchema and update the 'get' method.  It is slightly confusing having a getSchema here and a getSchema in the Store when they actually return different things.. Can this be private?\n. I think we will leave any restrictions on the description currently as it isn't 'used' anywhere.  We can look into updating this in the future though if we need to.. Can elementDef.groupBy be null? if so you will get a NPE thrown.  Might be worth adding the null != elementDef.groupBy check?. .toJson() uses that method. This is already there. Ah, this was just meant to say different schema.  It is correct for the exception to be thrown when adding a second Schema with the same ID but different Schema.. I have updated this logic in GraphLibrary now. It is no longer a static method.  a graphLibrary would have to be instantiated then cleared each time, which currently it doesn't do.  It works without clearing it.. this can just be done with jquery:\n$.(\"#resource_job\").attr(\"hidden\", true);. Can we move this all into it's own method.  More will be added here in other tickets and it will get very busy.. This callback will only run on success, not sure you really need the check.  If you want it is possible to use function(responseData, statusText) {if(statusText !== \"Success\")()}.  Better way to check the response.. Is there anyway this can throw an error that would expose an existing Schema? this is caught at the end and just thrown again.  Needs some thinking.  Also applies to the else of this if.. I need to keep the name, so when the merge is run it will add the name to the mergedNamedViewNames, otherwise it will still work but the user won't be able to keep track of what the current NamedView consists of.. I don't think this is necessary.  If a NamedView is nested, then the parent will contain the NamedView name of the merged NamedViews, even if they are nested on several levels.  There is a test in to check.. This won't be necessary, as NamedViews are merged all the lists are concatenated so the top level NamedView list of mergedNamedViewNames will contain all child NamedView names.  Tests have been added to check expected behaviour is correct.. should read \"given its\". Just a quick note, depending on which PR is merged first this will need updating. This is on the four lines below, but at a WARN level.. an update with strictJson boolean as null is never tested. If I move all of these, for example the new Identity function, it will not be accessible in the SchemaMigration where it is currently used.  These, or at least the Identity class will need to stay accessible out of test.. \"The direction\" I think makes more sense? This summary is also identical almost to the Summary in DirectedType. \"Is the Edge directed?\". There is an if below for the same thing.. This can be removed. Do you mean do something like this? this.groupByProperties.addAll(Arrays.asList(groupByProperties)); \nIs there any benefit to this?. Can we pull this out of the FederatedStore and just update the javadoc and graphId var to something more general. This will be a breaking change. For anyone using it currently it will support the core op handlers, if we add this it will now not.  This is also why Travis is failing.. I think I'll leave this for now. This will not be a  \"not found\" issue if an IOException is thrown.  Can we just change this StoreException message to something just like throw new StoreException(\"IOException checking Path: \", e);. This will probably read better just as one line:\nList<String> variableNames = operation.getVariableNames() != null ? operation.getVariableNames() : Lists.newArrayList();\nI know returning earlier will be more efficient but the iteration of an empty list should not really affect performance.. This variable can be moved to within the getPartitionIds method.  I see why you have done this but it is only used within that method therefore could be declared at method not class level.. This can be removed after above comment.. This can be removed after above comment.. This can be removed after above comment.. If this is moved below the if(0 == splitPoints.size()) (to be changed in below comment) then it can just be set with final int partitionKetLength = splitPoints.get(0).getLength(); as we know it will not be empty because we have checked above. Can this just be changed to if(splitPoints.isEmpty).  This is a safer way to check an empty List.. Fixed.. Can this be private please.. Can we use the fromJson and toJson methods that are part of the JSONSerialisationTest class.  Similar to how it is written within ForEachTest.  This avoids the need for the SerialisationException bits.. This shouldn't really be in the operation.handler package.. Great work bud (Y). Ah sorry I forgot this was an interface.  No worries thats fine as it is.. This line shouldn't be necessary. These tests objects should normally just be a new instance of the class, in the background for some things it does some checks for required fields etc which if they are populated will not throw exceptions correctly.  Can you change this back to just the new AdditionalOperations();. Can we keep these methods protected.  They are protected in super class and public here.  Same for the rest.. This line can come out of the try block.. can we change this to assertFalse and remove the not operator.  Just can be slightly confusing to skip read if you miss the not.. Same here. ",

    "ddseapy": "great, thanks!. Disregard: properties are correctly inherited, was just my machine's javac was pointing to a java 7.. Think that second point makes sense now.  I was confusing ingest aggregation with query aggregation.  Basically the aggregator is only really used at ingest time to group elements and doesn't use the accumulo combine iterator.\n(https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/blob/3bc134e920b1fb46e61a8fe2b333b495c14dd3ed/core/store/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/store/util/AggregatorUtil.java#L48). Thanks, your explanation makes sense.. 1 - Unfortunately I can't go into the specific use-case.  In general the issue arises when there are a subset of the properties that are metadata about the element which can be used to determine how many of the other properties are to be aggregated. One example is timestamp but there can be others.  The non-timestamp properties will be in the schema's groupBy so that the data is not lost and can be queried on if necessary.  However there are many times we don't want to query on the metadata, but rather just want it used to provide the aggregated results of the non-metadata properties.  Hope that helps.  This can all be solved by bundling the metadata properties into each non-metdata property whos aggregation it affects, however it would be nice if that wasn't the necessary.  Thanks for pointing me to the First operator, as it would make sense to use that in situations where we will not change the groupBy and just need the timestamp for aggregation.\n2 - In general, what are the limitations on what can change in the schema when using the AddUpdateTableIterator class?  The comments say you can change the validationFunction and the aggregateFunction, and you mentioned you can add an element group.  That makes sense that it would be just an iterator change.  Specifically, would there be any issues in me adding a new property (whether groupBy or not) to an existing element group?  I understand that something like changing the groupBy list on an existing element group would likely require me writing a map-reduce job or an export/import of some kind.\nThanks!. Also, apologies for creating 2 unrelated issues/questions in one issue.. Wrt First biFunction, since visibilities are treated similar to a removed groupBy in accumulo at query time, the function could produce incorrect results even if I'm not explicitly overriding the groupBy in my query.. I'll close this issue since others have been created.\n1) If no one else needs to aggregate on multiple properties and since it's also probably never a blocker, I don't think it's a high priority.  Especially if it complicates the schema config.  If I have time to write it and think of a way to do it cleanly I'll throw up a pr to have you all look at it.\n2) Adding the info you both just provided on accumulo table migrations is very helpful, thanks.  I'm sure others will find it very useful in the readme.. I've been doing as you said, bundling them all in a property together.  Essentially I have a couple properties that affect how the rest of the properties get aggregated.  Instead of duplicating each property in all of the rest and writing a custom type for all them it's been easier making them all one property.\nAn example might be timestamp and prop1 affect the others (int, double, date...), so the options are:\n\n\nWrite serializers & aggregators for each bundled property: (timestamp, prop1, int), (timestamp, prop1, double), (timestamp, prop1, date)....\n\n\nWrite one serializer & aggregator for (timestamp, prop1, int, double, date...) and put them in one property\n\n\nI've gone with the later option for now.  Don't know that it's a problem, but doesn't seem ideal.  Aggregating multiple properties with one function would be nice.  This would avoid having to duplicate the data throughout the properties or collapse them all into one giant property.  Again, might be more trouble than it's worth to implement, don't know. \n . Looks good to me.  The ExampleTuple2BinaryOperator class and aggregateFunctions config make it seem very straightforward and flexible.  Satisfies my use-case.. ",

    "supamanda": "We're running on Amazon. We have 11 EC2s (one is designated the master) each of which have hadoop, accumulo, and spark. The table I'm looking at has about 154 million records split over 13 tablets - the breakdown is 2x27million, 2x15million, 1x 843, and the rest between 5 and 12 million. (I know it has significant skew but I am not concerned with that at the moment because I'm interested in the limitations of the software.) When I set up the RDD with GetRDDOfAllElements and then do a count the total read time for the table is 3.1h - and this seems independent of the job config because I've tried increasing memory, and spreading over more executor boxes and the completion time is the same. The completion times of the tasks are (approx) 1s, 1.3min, 7.3min, 8.5min, 9.7min, 2x27min, 4x1.6h, 2h, 3.1h.\nIt's useful to know you don't recommend reading in the whole table - do you use an alternative input format to calculate summary statistics?\nI just tried to count an RDD created with GetRDDOfElements and the id for the vertex. The result was 8 million. This split into 2 tasks the first took 1.7min, and the second took 41mins. So there's no improvement significant enough to be really usable. I'm storing the vertex names as strings - is that likely to have a significant effect?\nOut of curiosity, I tried reading in the raw csv & tsv files and that completes in seconds. Maybe reading from the rfile will end up being closer to this kind of performance?. Thanks for your suggestions.\nFrom what I can see in the doco, EMR runs on EC2s, so it probably won't make any difference. We're using r4.2xlarge for the data nodes and a m4.4xlarge for the name node, so it looks like these shouldn't have any real network bandwidth issues.\nI did notice that the IP of the spark task executor rarely matches the IP of the accumulo tablet server it's reading from. Is there some config I have missed that will help them match up better?\nThe tablet server jvms each are allocated 2G max, I'm not sure whether that's reasonable or not, and I could probably beef them up a little. \nI tried re-ingesting the data which has reduced the skew somewhat but did not improve the performance at all. However, I noticed that the scan read rate fluctuates significantly (on the accumulo UI, the number in the query column sits on 800 for a while, then goes to 30K for a while and then back down to 800). Also, particular tablets are consistently slower than others. So I'm starting to wonder whether it's the data. I'm using netflow data (sourced from http://mcfp.weebly.com/the-ctu-13-dataset-a-labeled-dataset-with-botnet-normal-and-background-traffic.html) that I haven't aggregated on ingest so each edge is an event - which explains the 8 million result for a single vertex. There are 13 properties on each edge at this stage. I've tried to pinpoint exactly where the slow parts are (because the bad performance seemed to follow the data) and the scan rate slows dramatically when it is reading the millions of edges between the same vertices. Do you think it could be because the row id would be the same for all of those millions of edges?. > You should get locality most of the time\nI read that in both the accumulo doco and the spark doco, so was surprised that it wasn't happening for me. I've tried configuring the accumulo.properties with the zookeeper master address only and the entire list of cluster addresses but that doesn't make any different, so apart from writing some code for spark to try to use a specific tablet server I'm not really sure what else I could configure to force the locality. Any ideas on that?\n\nWe'd encourage you to think about using aggregation to replace the 8 million edges between the same 2 nodes with a summarised version. This could significantly reduce the data volumes.\nIf you can share your schema and generators for converting the raw data to elements, it's possible we could try the same experiments you're doing to see what the performance is.\n\nI have since looked at the data more closely and realised that there was likely a lot of overlap: https://mcfp.felk.cvut.cz/publicDatasets/CTU-13-Dataset/CTU-13-Dataset.tar.bz2 is processed already and the .netflow and .netflow.csv files from the first 6 CTU-Malware-Capture-Botnet at https://mcfp.felk.cvut.cz/publicDatasets/ are raw data, some of which may actually be in the first data set. The 8 million edges between 2 nodes are in the raw data and mostly seem to be accessing the google dns server, so in this case those edges are probably not useful anyway - though I guess it depends on your use case. \nI've attached my schema and generator schema_and_generator.zip - it would be interesting to see whether you see any performance issues.\n. FYI - my data locality issue was a spark config issue.. I was also able to improve the scan time significantly (complete in 11 mins) by increasing the table.scan.max.memory and using a batch scanner.. I was using a copy of the GetRDDOfAllElements that I'd added the following line to:\nInputConfigurator.setBatchScan(AccumuloInputFormat.class, conf, true);. Good idea @p013570  - I'll work on it :). From my point of view, it seems clearer to be able to distinguish in the data whether the edge is bi-directed or undirected - but I am far from an expert in this field. I don't know whether you would have undirected and bi-directed edges in the same graph, and I also don't know whether it would have a negative effect on performance if you did allow it.\nValidation failed if I tried to store an undirected edge element when the edge's schema had directed set to true, so I ended up storing two copies of the edge (one for each direction). I haven't yet tried leaving the directed setting out of the schema - does that work?. Great! Thanks for that, I'll try it out.. Yep, by default timestamp I meant leaving the timestampProperty out of the schema. \nI've been getting these results with bulk ingest - do you think that is what's affecting it?\nHere is the original schema and generator schema_and_generator.zip. Great! Thank you :). Hi @p013570 \nNo worries :)\nI've been experimenting with the same data, and still having a problem. The discrepancy is smaller now but it is inconsistent between ingests. My counts by protocol are below: the first and second ingests were both done with gaffer v1.1.1. \nProtocol type | Expected ingest count | First ingest count | Second ingest count \n------|------|------|------\n arp| 10545|10545|10545\n esp| 47|47|47\n gre| 4|4|4\n icmp| 516603|516603|516603\n igmp| 38709|38709|38709\n ipnip| 1|1|1\n ipv6| 216|216|216\nipv6-icmp| 1120|1120|1120\n ipx/spx| 267|267|267\n llc| 7|7|7\n pim| 140|140|140\n rarp| 19|19|19\n rsvp| 7|7|7\n rtcp| 22208|22208|22208\n rtp| 27652|27652|27652\n tcp| 4442479|4442478|4442473\nudp|29316444|29316420|29316421\n udt| 115|115|115\n unas| 16|16|16\nI identified 2 missing records from the first ingest:\nThe first is a tcp event which should generate one Netflow edge with our schema\n2011/08/11` 11:35:45.617342,248.283707,tcp,147.32.84.59,49403, ->,74.125.232.200,80,SRPA_FSPA,0,0,22,5643,1098,flow=Background-Established-cmpgw-CVUT\nThe second was a udp event which should generate 2 Netflow edges with our schema, but only stored the flipped dest-> src edge\n2011/08/14 03:45:37.194900,0.000221,udp,147.32.85.34,63301,  <->,147.32.80.9,53,CON,0,0,2,326,86,flow=To-Background-UDP-CVUT-DNS-Server\nI'm still looking into whether I can find some pattern behind why certain events are missing, but wondering if you might have any insight?. We've got accumulo v1.7.3 - I just had a look through the release notes and the silent data loss fix went in 1.6.4 and 1.7.1 so I'm guessing this version should be ok - or maybe there's still a problem no one else has picked up yet...? I'll keep looking and see about upgrading to 1.8.1. If you've got any more ideas please let me know :). I got the counts in a few different ways (to sanity check):\n\nI introduced a Protocol entity with vertex set to the protocol type and an aggregated count property, and then created one for each Netflow edge\nI wrote a Gaffer operation called CountByProtocol (based on CountGroups) that I used to pulled out the protocol from the Netflow edge and so count by protocol\nI used spark to read in all of the Netflow edges, grouped by protocol and then counted\nI used spark to read in all of the NetflowCount edges, grouped by protocol and summed on count\nI used spark to read in the original csv, added a column setting the count to 1 if it's a unidirectional row and 2 if it's bi-directional, and grouped by protocol and then summed on my new column\n\nI can give you pieces of my code if that would help?\nI don't have a straight forward script to identify exactly which records are missing in each run - I ran many spark commands to iteratively reduce the set of records I was looking at by comparing counts by protocol type, state, label, duration, src/dest port (though you need to massage the original data a bit to orient the records and duplicate the records correctly to match what is expected in Gaffer). I have kept the history of at least one of my spark sessions which I could clean up and share as well if that would also be helpful?. hi,\nI'm not sure how my change caused the rest api test to fail - any suggestions?\nFailed tests: \n  OperationServiceV2IT>OperationServiceIT.shouldReturnChunkedOperationChainElements:87->AbstractRestApiIT.verifyElements:84 expected:<3> but was:<0>.

    "g609bmsma": "Am I okay to tackle this one? Realise it says needs to be done with a major release and that it's a breaking change, so want to be careful. So far I've refactored the two inner classes into their own outer classes with no errors in the code for any of the files. Upon testing, there's one failed test (shouldReturnOutputClassForOperationWithOutput in OperationServiceV2IT.java) which I'm currently trying to find the root cause of. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.. Think I've solved the issue, seems the issue was I needed to make some stuff protected instead of private. All tests passing so far, hope that continues.. I've been having a go at this, and have added the GetElementsBetweenSets to the 'if' clauses in GetWalks.java, and written the relevant tests, and all seems to work correctly (GetWalksTest.java all pass). However, upon running the mvn clean install build, I get errors stating that the package uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.accumulostore.operation.impl does not exist. I'm guessing this is down to cyclical/circular dependencies? Any suggestions on how to resolve?. Hello, if possible I'd like to have a go at working on this issue, but I've got a couple of questions for some clarity on the issue. I can't find any class named NamedOperationParameter, so I assume it's adding some sort of options to the LinkedHashMap(?) parameters? Or is this related to the options in the same class? Or is it something else I'm missing entirely?\n`\npublic class NamedOperation implements\n        InputOutput, O>,\n        MultiInput {\n    private Iterable<? extends I_ITEM> input;\n@Required\nprivate String operationName;\nprivate LinkedHashMap<String, Object> parameters;\nprivate Map<String, String> options;\n\n. I've added both getOptions and setOptions functions, along with all the relevant appends and builders. All tests in the folder seem to be passing at the moment, need to run through the whole project and see if any of the integration testing or other test issues arise.. Run tests through the whole project, no errors, so seems happy. Shall I write a specific ParameterDetailTest where the options functions run as a unit test?. Having had more of a look through testing for ParameterDetail, instead of writing a dedicated test, would it be better to expand shouldShallowCloneOperation() in AddNamedOperationTest.java, since it utilises ParameterDetail?. Ok thanks, managed to figure a separate ParameterDetailTest earlier, but I'll have another crack at adding options toshouldShallowCloneOperation()andshouldJsonSerialiseAndDeserialise()inAddNamedOperationTest.java. In addition toParameterDetailTest.javaI've managed to getshouldShallowCloneOperation()working inAddNamedOperationTest.javaas well. However, haven't been able to getshouldJsonSerialiseAndDeserialise()to work, as it seems adding the parameters in the same was as inshouldShallowCloneOperation()` then causes an error when it comes to serialising it as JSON. Anyone got any tips? I've added the current (failing) version of the test below\n`public void shouldJsonSerialiseAndDeserialise() {\n    Map<String, ParameterDetail> parameters = new HashMap<>();\n    parameters.put(\"testParameter\", mock(ParameterDetail.class));\n    parameters.put(\"optionTestParameter\", mock(ParameterDetail.class));\n\n    final AddNamedOperation obj = new AddNamedOperation.Builder()\n            .operationChain(OPERATION_CHAIN)\n            .description(\"Test Named Operation\")\n            .name(\"Test\")\n            .parameters(parameters)\n            .overwrite()\n            .readAccessRoles(USER)\n            .writeAccessRoles(USER)\n            .score(0)\n            .build();\n\n    // When\n    final byte[] json = toJson(obj); //THIS IS WHERE IT FAILS\n    final AddNamedOperation deserialisedObj = fromJson(json);\n\n    // Then\n    JsonAssert.assertEquals(String.format(\"{%n\" +\n            \"  \\\"class\\\" : \\\"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.named.operation.AddNamedOperation\\\",%n\" +\n            \"  \\\"operationName\\\": \\\"Test\\\",%n\" +\n            \"  \\\"description\\\": \\\"Test Named Operation\\\",%n\" +\n            \"  \\\"readAccessRoles\\\": [\\\"User\\\"],%n\" +\n            \"  \\\"writeAccessRoles\\\": [\\\"User\\\"],%n\" +\n            \"  \\\"score\\\": 0,%n\" +\n            \"  \\\"overwriteFlag\\\": true,%n\" +\n            \"  \\\"operationChain\\\": {\" +\n            \"  \\\"operations\\\": [{\\\"class\\\": \\\"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAdjacentIds\\\", \\\"input\\\": [{\\\"vertex\\\": \\\"seed\\\", \\\"class\\\": \\\"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.data.EntitySeed\\\"}]}]}\" +\n            \"}\"), new String(json));\n    assertNotNull(deserialisedObj);\n}`. Managed to get `shouldJsonSerialiseAndDeserialise()` to work with ParameterDetails Options. I've created a branch and had a go at this and think I've got it working right (removed the properties, and then the functions and tests pertaining to them) - should i merge into develop, or wait until the specific develop-1.9.0 branch is created?. I've made the requested change, and changed the dedicated unit test and shallowClone test in `AddNamedOperationTest` accordingly. However, in the same file, I can't get the `shouldJsonSerialiseAndDeserialise` test to work any more, due to a trailing whitespace that appears after the close of the LinkedHashMap. Currently the test is as follows:\n\n`public void shouldJsonSerialiseAndDeserialise() {\n        Map parameters = new HashMap<>();\n        List optionsList = Arrays.asList(\"option1\", \"option2\", \"option3\");\n    parameters.put(\"testOption\", new ParameterDetail(\"Description\", String.class,false, \"On\", optionsList));\n\n    final AddNamedOperation obj = new AddNamedOperation.Builder()\n            .operationChain(OPERATION_CHAIN)\n            .description(\"Test Named Operation\")\n            .name(\"Test\")\n            .overwrite()\n            .readAccessRoles(USER)\n            .writeAccessRoles(USER)\n            .parameters(parameters)\n            .score(0)\n            .build();\n\n    // When\n    final byte[] json = toJson(obj);\n    final AddNamedOperation deserialisedObj = fromJson(json);\n\n    final String expected = String.format(\"{%n\" +\n            \" \\\"class\\\" : \\\"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.named.operation.AddNamedOperation\\\",%n\" +\n            \" \\\"operationName\\\": \\\"Test\\\",%n\" +\n            \" \\\"description\\\": \\\"Test Named Operation\\\",%n\" +\n            \" \\\"score\\\": 0,%n\" +\n            \" \\\"operationChain\\\": {\" +\n            \" \\\"operations\\\": [{\\\"class\\\": \\\"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAdjacentIds\\\", \\\"input\\\": [{\\\"class\\\": \\\"uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.data.EntitySeed\\\", \\\"vertex\\\" : \\\"seed\\\"}]}]},%n\" +\n            \" \\\"overwriteFlag\\\" : true,%n\" +\n            \" \\\"parameters\\\" : {\\\"testOption\\\": {\\\"description\\\" :\\\"Description\\\", \\\"defaultValue\\\": \\\"On\\\", \\\"valueClass\\\": \\\"java.lang.String\\\", \\\"required\\\": false, \\\"options\\\": \\\"[option1, option2, option3]\\\"}},%n\" +\n            \" \\\"readAccessRoles\\\" : [ \\\"User\\\" ],%n\" +\n            \" \\\"writeAccessRoles\\\" : [ \\\"User\\\" ]%n\" +\n            \"}\");\n\n    // Then\n    JsonAssert.assertEquals(expected, new String(json));\n    assertNotNull(deserialisedObj);\n\n`\n. Fixed the test issue I was having, needed to switch around which assertEquals I was using in order to realise I was missing some \\\" markers in the options that weren't being highlighted by JsonAssert.assertEquals.

    "c015dariu": "Is this issue still being worked on? If not, I can happily finish it off.. Hey I've tried to take a stab at this issue myself but I'm getting nullpointers when running OperationChainValidatorTests, whenever it tries to run validateOperationChain using any(Set.class) it always puts in a null to the method, this only happens when it's made static and I can't seem to figure out why.. If you mean via the constructor I fully agree, I have tried removing all references to instanced View Validators and replaced with static calls (and also leaving them and testing that way as well), however my concern is towards the test which utilises Mockito to test the method parameters. I believe Mockito has issues testing static methods as, despite having no change other than now being static (which I've tried calling via instance or via class), it causes mockito to change its behaviour and fail the test. I would replace that line with a test which similarly covers that behaviour but unfortunately I don't fully understand what Mockito achieves with that line.\nLine in question:\ngiven(ViewValidator.validate(any(View.class), any(Schema.class), anySet())).willReturn(new ValidationResult());\nWhich lies in this method within OperationChainValidatorTest:\n```\nprivate void validateOperationChain(final OperationChain opChain, final boolean expectedResult) {\n    // Given\n    final OperationChainValidator validator = new OperationChainValidator(new ViewValidator());\n    final Store store = mock(Store.class);\n    final User user = mock(User.class);\ngiven(ViewValidator.validate(any(View.class), any(Schema.class), anySet())).willReturn(new ValidationResult());\n\n// When\nfinal ValidationResult validationResult = validator.validate(opChain, user, store);\n\n// Then\nassertEquals(expectedResult, validationResult.isValid());\n\n}\n```. My current PR is failing on a test that hid from me before committing which is being evasive but after alot of digging around I'm starting to see the issue with having FederatedViewValidator not able to override ViewValidator (thanks to being static), which means the correct ViewValidator is not being used for Federated requests. A quick fix would have been to check the instance of store or the operation chain when passing into OperationChainValidator to identify federated chains/store and then using the appropriate Validator however to access either of these classes requires dependency on Federated-Store which in turn causes a cyclic dependency loop.\nI'm running into a brick wall with my understanding of the Gaffer code, is there a better way or place to make this check/fix?. #2047 \nHello @m55624, I've managed to get a solution with checkstyle however whichever way I think to solve it, some issues regarding  will crop up.\nCheckstyle is not happy with ViewValidator (now being recognized as an utility class) not being final and having a non-default constructor, so I could only see three solutions but there is probably a much easier one I've missed:\n\nRemove inheritance between FederatedViewValidator and ViewValidator, give both private constructors and make Federated call validateEdge/Entities statically. This involves making the two methods public rather than protected.\nRefactor packages to preserve protected methods, I imagine this will break alot of classes.\nMerge both Federated and View into one, and change the name of Federated's validate method to validateFederated\n\nThe current PR involved method 1.. Hi, looking into this issue, would this not be as simple as adjusting the constructor to copy over the variables alongside the current exporter copy?\nI don't believe contexts are ever shallow cloned more than once (or however many sub-graphs in the federation) during their lifetime before they are thrown and new ones created for the next operation chain so I don't think there will be any size issues with this.. Oops just saw the comment, will work on it now. @m55624 also I can't seem to stop travis builds so it might be worth cancelling my ones.. I'll take a look and see if I can fix this.. @m55624 added the test, had to change the context builder because despite allowing the addition of variables, .build() did not actually apply them to the created context. The constructor used in .build() is deprecated however I've left it as it is however with the addition of a small check to see whether to add variables or not.. @m55624 Just noticed another bug within context regarding addVariables() where it is accidentally referencing the passed in variable for null rather than whether a map currently exists within the object which means it could crash if a variable is added without using set first. Just working on fixing that one and making sure it hasn't broken anything now.. Okay, so I decided to add a couple of tests to cover the variables side of Context and came across an issue where Collections.singletonMap was being used to instantiate variables where none existed, this meant context could only hold one variable in the map and would throw an exception if any others were added. I've now added two tests to cover setVariables and addVariables (previously unused) and fixed the two methods. Uploading once checkstyle and tests have passed on my end.. Requested changes resolved.. Hi, just taken a look at the code and given a try of writing a test however I don't quite understand what you mean by the class being duplicated. Is this in regards to retaining all the variable values or that the pointer of the class is different after serialisation?. ",

    "GCHQ-83497": "@c015dariu It looks like OperationChainValidator uses a ViewValidator.  If we are making that static, I don't think we should be passing that through.. Yeah I meant the constructor. In response to your concern, mockito doesn't support mocking statics as you can predict their response. Using given is attempting to mock the response of validate() so that it returns a new ValidationResult() every time it is called and we shouldn't really be doing this.. Ran in a rather large brick wall with this. Have tried using custom serialisers and deserialisers with annotations, tired adding those also in with StoreProperties and have also tried modifying koryphe. Haven't got a clue where to go next with this one, so happy for someone else to have a go. . ",
    "n288TJYRX": "What is this blocked by? Is it okay to go ahead and work on?. Theres a method validateDirection() in SchemaElementDefinitionValidator.java that is never used and is commented out. This is within the develop branch already, so it looks like its already been merged. Shall I uncomment it and create a unit test for it?. Ready for pull request once we get to V2. Can you assign this to me? I think I should be able to do this. Hi, I'm struggling with an error. I've changed the classes NamedViewResolverTest, NamedOperationResolverTest and UpdateViewHookTest extend GraphHookTest but one test is ignored. The shouldHaveJsonPropertyAnnotation test of JSONSerialisationTest.java. It says it is \"Missing JsonPropertyOrder annotation on class\". For Log4jLogger I can't use fromJson to load the class from file, because the file is not json. The file is log4j.xml. There are no json files for the classes NamedViewResolver, NamedOperationResolver or UpdateViewHook. I can't implement the getTestObjects() method correctly, is this the cause of the annotation problem? Should I just write \"new ClassName()\" in these getTestObject() methods?. Do you mean add the annotation to each of the classes, not GraphHook? Just noticed the other classes that work already have the annotation @JsonPropertyOrder(alphabetic = true). This seems to work now.. Is this done? AddNamedOperation implements the Operations interface already.. There are already a couple of unit tests for checking authorisation of the operations in the operation chain. To test more combinations, I need to know what operations each authorisation level allows. Where can I find this info?. I'll try this. ",
