    "garrettr": "Nitpick: we should remove the white background in the icon .png's and make it transparent instead, so it looks good against the gray/chrome UI. I can do this really easily in a later commit if you don't have any image manipulation software handy.\n. Otherwise, :thumbsup: \n. Whoops! Looks like rebasing it lost all of mmc's line notes. Won't do that again.\n. Opened #6 to track writing unit tests.\n. Talked to Peter about this. General problem is nsIXMLHttpRequest's don't QI to nsIDOMWindow the same way nsIChannel's do. That means we can't use the same logic to determine if they're first/third party and extract the origin info. One solution might be to detect the type of request, and use a different QI chain if it's XHR (I'm not sure if that's possible).\nAnother solution might be to do XHR-related updates from the nsIContentPolicy, rather than in the http-on-examine-response observer. In the context, it is easy to determine if a request is XHR (aContentType == nsIContentPolicy.TYPE_XHR) and whether it is 3rd party (getBaseDomain(aContentLocation) == getBaseDomain(aRequestOrigin)). The only problem is that I'm not sure how to access any related cookies. In the original example, the contents of the request itself is relevant as well.\nI've run into this issue before, while working on logging blocked cross-site XHR for Firefox. I've talked to bz about it and IIRC there's a way to get the window from an XMLHttpRequest, although he did not encourage me to use it.\n. On the other hand, it might be ok to ignore these, assuming that our heuristics eventually block the loading of the 3rd party scripts entirely. These scripts must be storing local state somewhere (either in page cookies or localStorage), so as long as we can detect that then we might be ok.\n. Here's another example (from mozilla.org):\nconsole.log: privacybadgerfirefox: No window associated with request: https://246059135.log.optimizely.com/event?a=246059135&d=25134714&y=false&s245617832=none&s245875585=direct&s245677587=ff&s246048108=false&s237061344=none&s237321400=ff&s237335298=search&s237485170=false&n=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fabout%2F&u=oeu1390506273861r0.06090165024070571&wxhr=true&t=1390533849524&f=543162200,553600251\n.

Going to revisit this once the updating/blocking architecture has settled.\n\nWhy can't this be done in nsIContentPolicy for everything?\n\nWe don't get a channel in shouldLoad, so it might be harder to get the request and look at the cookies. I'll see if I can reliably QI to one (maybe from aContext?).\nThis does make a lot of sense because otherwise we duplicate a bunch of preliminary work, i.e. the checks to see if the request should be considered at all.\n. That's why I had them separated in the first place :grins: Well, I liked the mental model of:\n1. this isn't even valid to look at it, so allow it\n2. policy says to allow it\n3. policy says to block it\n. Also, this pr breaks cfx test. Plz fix.\n. > Note that starting the addon with cfx run works fine.\nYeah, but that's not good enough. We want tests. Your workaround is good for now.\n. This surprised me - I thought it would be handled automatically. Lightbeam has the same problem.\nIn an ideal world, the Add-on SDK's onUnload listener would be the way to implement this. Unfortunately, it does not work for the uninstall case.\nIt looks like this bug is impossible to resolve without patching Firefox.\nThe closest thing we could do is listen for the disable event, since (from skimming bug comments, could be wrong) it gets called before uninstall. We could pop an alert saying \"Are you trying to uninstall Lightbeam? If so, do you want to clear your saved information?\" but... that's horrible UX.\n. What we ended up doing for Lightbeam is having a clearly marked \"Clear Data\" button, and encouraging users who wish to clear their data to use it. We no longer promise that their data is cleared when the addon is uninstalled (because we cannot).\nHaving a similar \"Clear Data\" or \"Reset\" function might be good for Privacy Badger. If we add the ability to export the list of blocked domains (e.g in ABP-compatible format), this would be a logical UI companion.\nSince we use the Add-On SDK's simple-storage for everything, the quickest path to automatically clearing data on uninstall would be a fix for Bug 627432.\n. That's what Lightbeam does as well. The connections within that private browsing window can be visualized, but are not stored. They also pop up an alert to explain what's going on to the user. Code.\n. Jetpack has a Private Browsing API.\n. After a conversation with @diracdeltas and @pde today, here's what we ideally want:\nPrivacy Badger runs in private browsing windows. We need a separate data store for private browsing that is identical to the main data store, but stores all interactions (observed domains, heuristic blocklist updates, and per-host user settings) from private browsing. When the private browsing session ends (no more private browsing windows are open), this data store is cleared.\nSlightly tricky: keeping the private data store updated as changes to the main data store occur (since users may have both a private session and non-private session concurrently).\nWe can use sdk/private-browsing to determine if a window/tab is private with isPrivate, and we can detect when the private browsing session is over (last private browsing window closed) by listening for the system event last-pb-context-exited.\nIMHO the best way to implement this is to abstract all of the storage into a single object, which can maintain the non-private (persisted) and private data structures transparently. I think we'll need to pass it the window whenever we use it so it can determine whether we're in a private context. It can also listen for last-pb-context-exited and clear the private data stores transparently.\nA quick skim of the code shows that this isn't too hard. Most of the places where we update storage have or are near the relevant window object, so we should be able to provide it with minimal refactoring. Requiring another parameter is a little clunky, but seems necessary. I'm open to other ideas.\n. > What happens if users have multiple private browsing sessions open at once?\nAll open private browsing windows share the same state, so I don't think it's possible to have multiple private browsing sessions open at once. Basically, as soon as one private browsing window is opened, a temporary set of state is created, and is maintained and shared across all private browsing windows as long as at least one private browsing window is open. When the last window is closed, this temporary state is cleared.\n. \"Never remember history\" is basically \"every session is a private browsing\nsession, but with the normal UI\" (confusing)\n. This is almost certainly due to the incomplete {first-,third-}party classification in Policy.isBlockableRequest.\n. @diracdeltas This pr was checked out form master with the last merged pr included. Why can't we merge it?\n. > When ABP is installed, it seems that PB usually shows less domains in the popup. I'm not sure why; maybe ABP is blocking requests before us, so we don't get to see some things that we would otherwise block.\nThis is likely. Internally, nsIContentPolicy is just a list of content policies that gets iterated over for each request, and the first policy to reject a request wins. Have you tried installing ABP and PB in different orders to see if that changes things? I'm not sure, but think order of installation might affect order of content policy registration.\n. The relevant pref here is \"network.cookie.cookieBehavior\". Details on possible settings (link may rot)\nThere are a lot of options for what to do here, depending on the details of Firefox's implementation (research is needed here). If 3rd party cookies are blocked, either entirely or only for non-1st parties, then Privacy Badger won't be able to update its heuristics. We should communicate that to the user, possibly with a bit of text in the Panel.\nIt would be cool if, even with prefs set to block 3rd party cookies, for Privacy Badger to display the requests with blocked cookies and allow the user to toggle them. Not sure if this is possible, depends on implementation (needs research).\n. @pde Why not just check each time a request to a blocked domain is attempted?\n. @cooperq @pde Is there any reason we're using SHA1 instead of a more future-proof hash function?\n. Yes\nOn Mar 27, 2014 10:24 AM, \"Yan Zhu\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@garrettr https://github.com/garrettr can i assign this to you for now?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/24#issuecomment-38834126\n.\n.

Going to close for now, will reopen if we find a way to repro.\n. > If ads.com is seen tracking you on shopping.google.com and maps.google.com, should that count as two strikes in the heuristic blocker? (Right now it counts as one.)\n\nI'd say it should count as one strike. Our key concern is cross-site tracking - it's reasonable to assume that Google can track users across all of its subdomains.\n. I think we should focus on the \"classic\" cookies case first, get that working well, then extend PB to detect/prevent this case, and after that, \"supercookie\"-type persistence (localStorage, indexedDB, etc.). I'd put this on the next release's milestone, since I expect it might take quite a bit of testing.\n. This all lgtm!\n. Note that browser-action emulates the functionality of sdk/ui. We should use sdk/ui for FF 29+, and browser-action for backwards compat.\n. How did you pick the 2. rule? Instances of intermittent connectivity usually last longer than 15 seconds. Wouldn't it make more sense to, say, try every 5 minutes for an hour?\n. @pde Thanks for the explanation! I got the Huffman code approximation for 0-9 and the language codes, but didn't see the rationale for the really common cookie values (that you were considering them to all be in the same group).\nWe may be able to do something better with this and Lightbeam, but that is not in the works right now. We do not collect, or plan to collect, cookie values for obvious reasons.\n. @diracdeltas Sorry about that! I agree that it'd be nice to get the style nits fixed, but given our timeline, not something we should be blocking on. @cooperq If you have time to fix Yan's comments that would be awesome.\n. Whoops, was trying to create a milestone.\n. Rebased on master and updated text.\n. Are there any related errors in the browser console?\n. Yeah, I think that's intentional behavior on the part of the SDK. If you already have the addon installed, reinstalling it would either lead to an \"enable\" event (if it was previously disabled) or an \"upgrade\" event (if it was a prior version). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Listening_for_load_and_unload for the list of events (options.loadReason).\n. @diracdeltas Sorry, I was confused (thought you meant popup == first run page). FWIW I just installed (and re-installed) the XPI from this PR and the popup works for me. Your case test is pretty esoteric, is this really a blocker?\n. Since the code changes to lib/ are so minor, I can't see how they would be\ncausing this problem. We might want to open a new issue to investigate this\n(and have it block this PR).\n. Someone needs to provide better gifs/pngs to fix the border problem.\nSee the toolbar button PR for an explanation of why the animation looks\ncrappy in FF29. You will find it looks much better in FF30. I might b able\nto improve the situation in FF29 if you think that's worthwhile.\n. @pde Haha woah, that's a lot worse than I thought it was. I will fix this today.\n. @pde @diracdeltas What dark theme are you guys using? (for testing)\n. What's the best way to get the .png fixes?\n. I'd say we lump this together with #95. The icon doesn't look great, but PB is still usable with a dark theme. I'm marking this as an enhancement for 1.0 (of course, it'd be great to resolve it before then).\n. Fixing this would also remove the slight delay that occurs when we close the panel, open a new tab, and then re-open the panel (the panel contents that corresponded to the previous tab are briefly visible).\n. Agree with the wontfix. I do not think we should expend effort supporting any versions of FF < the current ESR. All users using lower versions should consider upgrading immediately as they are no longer receiving security or stability updates.\n. Closing wontfix. @jerkey If you upgrade Iceweasel to either the ESR (24) or the current stable (29) you will be able to use Privacy Badger. I also encourage you to do this for the safety and stability of your web browsing generally.\n. This is mostly already implemented (but commented out) in lib/policyCheck.js. Some things that should be resolved:\n1. The WorkerQueue should be tweaked to provide the exact behavior we want. Right now we push n domains to check into the queue, and check them one by one at a given interval (1s currently). Some improvements that could be made:\n   1. Run requests in parallel batches (e.g. be processing 4 requests at a time).\n   2. Detect if requests are failing and do something smart (maybe retry them again, sooner than the next 24hr interval, and stop the rest of the queue until then).\n2. @diracdeltas had privacy concerns. We should clarify these. I don't see a problem with sending requests to a site that users have already visited, since we aren't leaking information about any of their other history or behavior to that site (with the exception of their local network information. Perhaps over time, a nefarious site could use this to track them geographically?)\n. @diracdeltas Definitely we should strip the cookies. Why does the timing of the request matter?\n. @diracdeltas I don't think it could really extended to a practical fingerprinting technique, especially because of the many variables affecting timing consistency, the long interval, and that it wouldn't persist over browser restarts. But it is leaking some information for no good reason, and it is easy to mitigate.\nSo the algorithm should be:\n1. recheck blocked sites on startup\n2. pick a random timestamp in (now, now+24hrs)\n3. repeat\nWhat do you think? And do you want me to implement this?\n. Can you give a more precise set of Steps to Reproduce (STR), starting with how you installed the addon? After installation, a \"first run\" page should pop up with some info about the addon, and you should see an icon added to the toolbar in the top right of the screen.\n. Changed title to reflect that this is specifically about not seeing the icon after installation. We were getting mis-filed bugs elsewhere that were really dupes of this.\n. @neverumind Are you using the \"Never remember history\" setting?\n. @xapaho How are you creating the custom toolbar? Is that through an addon, or a native Firefox feature?\n. @Migas7 This bug was closed as a side effect of it originally being misfiled on the wrong Github issues page (that of the Chrome version of this same extension). That was due to Github's magic auto-closing behavior, and was not an attempt to dismiss the issue.\nAdditionally, the issue you are reporting is not the same as this one. Normally I would ask you to post a new issue, but your report is actually a dupe of #57 (which I see you have discovered - I've clarified the title of that issue to make it easier to find).\n. Great, now I can try to reproduce. We're using the Firefox Addon SDK for\nthe button UI, so I would hope this wouldn't be a problem. I will dig into\nthis later.\n. @gitarra clarification: that is only true on aurora and nightly. And I wouldn't hold your breath for it to land on stable (in fact, it may be backed out of aurora and nightly).\n. > Yes, it seems that you can get the domain sometimes. At other times the subject is undefined.\nDetailed breakdown\n\nAnnoyingly, we can't see the name/value of the cookie being rejected\n\nYes you can, you need to QI to nsICookie. See my POC.\n. Both true, apologies for not reading closer.\n. I think we've gotten a little off-topic with the JS cookies discussion, since we don't do anything with them now. The crux of this issue is: \"how can Privacy Badger update its heuristics, even if the user has set non-default cookie prefs\"?\nAt the moment we update the heuristics in our http-on-modify-request observer, which won't work if the user has non-default cookie prefs because the cookies will be removed before the observer is called. Instead, we need to to update them in an http-on-examine-response observer, as @diracdeltas mentioned previously. This should be a straightforward change.\n. Closing as a duplicate of #64. I agree that the best thing to do would be to operate sensibly even in the face of this pref, if we can.\n. I think we should have a separate CONTRIBUTING file, as you pointed out it\nis nicely integrated on Github.\nIf you could make those changes, Marek, it would be greatly appreciated!\n. I think we should also add notes about what information to include when\nreporting a bug, since we keep asking the same questions (what OS? What\nversion? What other addons?) in issues, but that can be a separate PR.\n. @mrshu Do you have time to address the comments on this PR?\n. This appears to be an issue with the community-contributed toolbarwidget library we are using. I am switched 29 to using the built-in SDK's code for this button (with a hack to fix some annoying behavior found in 29 only). I'd appreciate it if you could test the new code on your setup once it's ready!\n. @NightTrain What version of Firefox are you using?\n. The test issues are weird, but I don't think they should block merging this. I also want to get this into an .xpi somewhere ASAP so we can see if it fixes the variety of icon issues that I was unable to reproduce.\n. A sprinkling of magic perf dust? :grin:\nIf I had to guess, the problem is that ABP is leaking memory, seemingly\ndata structures associated with requests or windows. If Privacy Badger's\nContent Policy is getting run before ABP's, it may be blocking it from\nprocessing the requests and indirectly preventing the leakage.\n. @jancborchardt Note that add-ons are not \"supposed\" to do that. The Add-on bar is intended to be the default location for add-on icons. This was the goal in 255327ad4742b30bf3f6af34e2dd581607bb9cc5 (to put the icon in the toolbar, so the UI was consistent across < 29 and >= 29), but it caused more trouble than it was worth (see 101c6d4a1824c6ca088c264b0cc91b50d3e27a9b)\n. @jancborchardt Also, note that you can easily move the icon from the Add-on bar to the toolbar (or elsewhere in the browser). Right-click in the add-on bar or toolbar, choose \"Customize\" in the contextual menu that pops up, and then drag the PB icon from the Add-on bar to the toolbar.\n. @Twangist Regarding your last point about PB on FF 29/Win7 - do you have the \"Never remember history\" preference set?\n. @Twangist Yes, it is a known but tricky issue to get Privacy Badger working with Private browsing (see #11).\nAre you saying that the numbered problems 1 and 2 from your original comment are still problems?\n. @diracdeltas Was this closed by that commit? Note that the magic auto-close syntax would be \"Fix{,es} #81\". \n. @Blubarb \"Renders as text only\" sounds like CSS, or possibly CSS and other assets (images, video, etc.) are being blocked, so it sounds like we're blocking one of Google's CDN's.\nIf you have time, I recommend turning any red or yellow toggles back to green, one by one, and closing the panel (which will refresh the page). When you find one, or several, that cause the page to render normally, let us know in this issue. We are looking at ways to improve our whitelisting to avoid breaking popular websites!\n. @alaricd Blocking everything by default would break the web (see some of the other issues here). The idea of Privacy Badger is that it learns over time what 3rd parties appear to be tracking you. This is not immediate, but it does occur quickly, e.g. within a few hours of browsing after installation. The idea is that 3rd parties will gradually be blocked, and if this causes breakage, you can use the UI to either re-enable their requests, or enable the requests but block cookies (if that is sufficient to restore functionality, it should prevent the 3rd party from tracking you in the most common case).\n. I found this code confusing and hard to follow. More comments would be appreciated.\nI think this OK to merge since it fixes two tricky issues, but I am not happy with how tangled all the code has gotten. We should re-write the \"heuristic block algorithm\" document to incorporate the additional logic needed for handling non-default prefs, and maybe refactor this stuff to clarify.\n. Would be good to make sure we keep track of the user's preference before install, so we can try to restore it (on disable, since we don't have a reliable uninstall hook). And we should respect the user's choice if they change the pref while the addon is installed.\n. I agree that we should attempt to consolidate this logic at one call point if possible. My only concern with canceling requests in the observer is that, since the Content Policy API is the \"right way\" to do this kind of thing, we might run into unexpected and difficult-to-resolve issues. I tried to do this in a Heartbleed-related addon recently, and it was harder than I expected.\n\nGetting the window associated with the request is sometimes unreliable because we can't just call getWindowForChannel\n\nIIRC we used this code early on and it had its own issues (didn't work on XHR, for one). We might be able to improve this. FWIW, utils.getWindowForContext seems to work pretty well these days.\nbtw, it's probably better to \"block\" requests by canceling them instead of redirecting to a dummy location.\nI think the first step in this approach should be to try canceling requests in http-omr and see if the rest of the browser handles that correctly.\n. @rmenessec Which version of PB are you using? (check in about:addons) That looks like 0.1, and should be fixed by upgrading to 0.1.1.\n. @jeremy-w I like your suggestions a lot! Re-vamping the icon is not a priority right now, but I think it'd be nice to do it for 1.0.\nSince the initial issues no longer exist, and this issue is now about the aesthetics of the icon, I've changed the label from \"bug\" to \"enhancement\".\n. @rhelmer PB's heuristics aren't very smart right now. Since Persona loads third-party content with random-looking cookies (session identifiers), we mistake it for a tracker.\nThe ideal way to fix it would be for the Persona domain to post a compliant DNT policy so the addon will whitelist their requests and cookies. I think we're also considering an additional whitelist for things like Persona which just operate in this fashion and are difficult to distinguish. See #94, #86, and several others.\n. The bookmarklet is almost certainly injecting third party script that's setting cookies, so it should be blocked. The fact that it's not showing up is definitely a bug. The context in the on-modify-request listener might be different because of how the bookmarklet is loaded.\n\nOn Jul 21, 2014, at 11:05 PM, jdmartin notifications@github.com wrote:\nUsing the latest beta of Privacy Badger on Firefox, and the Instapaper bookmarklet is now broken.

Yeah, this is taken directly from the Chrome extension and is confusing. The \"frequency\" (of a 3rd party domain appearing on a first party) is computed by taking the length of the keys of httpRequestOriginFrequency[origin].\n\nI don't think it would be useful to store counts here (\"how many requests did tracker X make from site Y\"), although if it would be let me know and I can add that easily.

Yeah, but then we'd lose the map of 3rd to 1st parties, which might be useful (debugging, auditing, educational). We could make it so the map looks like\noriginFrequency = {\n  \"foo.com\": {\n    count: x,\n    on: [ a.com, b.com, ...]\n  },\n}\nThat way we can avoid computing the length each time (although I don't think that's expensive).\n.

Or you can use for..of, although I'm not sure if that's part of the JS version used by addons.\n. Ugh, stupid JS. I hate this idiom. An alternative would be for (let key in Object.keys(cookies)), because Object.keys() only enumerates the object's own properties.\n. I can never remember these things. It is allowed in Chrome JS code, so I see it a lot when working on Gecko. Sorry!\n. :+1: \n. How are you estimating the empty string to give you 3 bits of entropy?

Ok, fixing this.\n. Since userStorage stores hostnames, but the heuristic blocker only works with eTLD+1's, the only thing we have to be careful of is the case where hostname == eTLD+1.\n. Add a note: ideally with the \"magic auto-closing syntax\"\n. Add note explaining how to use cfx test\n. Add links to each of these releases, and a note about how to use cfx's -b flag to choose a binary for testing.\n. Yeah, it's really weird.

Though those errors seemed to be of a different variety.\n. Nit: Don't think this should be indented like it is.\n. Although you probably do want to indent this (I think 4 spaces?) so it's rendered with a pre tag.\n. I'd just say /path/to/firefox-binary and let people figure that out. With the links you gave above, Firefox gets extracted into a folder (at least on Linux) and is typically run from that folder, e.g I often do cfx test -b ~/Downloads/firefox-aurora/firefox.\n. I'd recommend linking \"tests pass\" to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/cfx#cfx_test\n. Nice!\n. What happened to hasSneakyTracking?\n. A lot of repeated code between .empty and .clear. Would be good to extract the common code into a helper function.\n. grep shows makeURI and unwrapURL are the only functions we use from ABPUtils.

If you use a count instead of a bool above, this can just be\nlet prevalence = originFrequency[origin]\n.

There's something like a \"Clear Data\" button in the settings menu in the panel, but empirically it seems that users don't understand what it does. It is labeled \"Clear all blocker settings\", perhaps it should just say \"Clear data\". \nThere's also a button in the same menu that only clears data that the user has set (meaning that it keeps the heuristic blocker settings). I'm leaning towards taking out this option.\nAt minimum, the \"Clear data\" button needs to clear PBadger's local stores and reset cookie permissions set by PBadger. If we've messed with any built-in Firefox prefs, such as enabling the DNT header, we also need to reset those preferences. It remains unknown how to signal to users that they need to click this button when uninstalling the extension.\n. What happens if users have multiple private browsing sessions open at once?\n. Decided that this should be punted to a later release.\n. For the record, in 0.1, Privacy Badger simply ignores private browsing windows. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/private-browsing.\n. Note that we are also not active if user chooses \"Never remember history\".\n. It makes sense to use the state of Privacy Badger from a user's normal browsing session as the initial state of Privacy Badger during Private Browsing sessions, but user feedback has shown that many frustrated people are on Private Browsing by default or set \"never remember history\".\nI would like to have a working solution for them in the next release, and it should even be good enough for Tor Browser Bundle users. Here's a proposal:\n1. During a private browsing session, store userset and heuristic-set blocking state in a separate data structure that gets deleted when the session ends.\n2. When the session starts, seed blockedOrigins with a hardcoded list of \"well-known\" trackers. @pde suggested generating this based on selenium crawls or data voluntarily collected from actual Privacy Badger users, but perhaps it's good enough for now to just fork the Disconnect list (which was generated from a crawl IIRC, though it may have been a while ago): https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect/blob/HEAD/firefox/content/disconnect.safariextension/opera/chrome/data/services.json\n. On second thought, it might be fine to persist blockedOrigins between normal and private sessions. It only stores eTLD+1's that are commonly-used enough to track you on 3 or more 1st parties. Seems unlikely to leak sensitive browsing history information this way.\noriginFrequency, however, should not be persisted beyond private browsing sessions because it stores first party origins as well.\nSo we can do accounting in originFrequency or originFrequencyPrivate depending on the window's privacy state. Then if \n(Object.keys(storage.originFrequency[origin]).length + Object.keys(storage.originFrequencyPrivate[origin]).length)) >= 3, add origin to blockedOrigins. When the private session ends, delete originFrequencyPrivate.\nthoughts?\n. Another, bigger issue: the nsICookiePermission is window-agnostic, so blocking/allowing a cookie in either session type blocks it in the other. :/\n. Thanks!\n. This is going to conflict with the changes I was working on for the last pull request (which got merged). I'll open a new pull request that includes this change.\n. Garrett and I debated whether we should use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/mozIThirdPartyUtil#isThirdPartyWindow%28%29, which recursively checks third-partiness against all higher windows in the window hierarchy (instead of just the top window).\n. I've been running AdBlockPlus and PB together since launch with no real issues. Closing for now until someone notices a problem.\n. Fixed by #30 \n. @garrettr can i assign this to you for now?\n. I decided it's good enough for now to only check for whitelist updates when the addon is loaded/unloaded.\n. relatedly: add firstrun.html.\n. @garrettr claims we can move the widget from the addons bar to the toolbar at the top of the browser, which would be nice. i claim it is not possible. who will win?\n. cloesd by #37 (except for firstrun.html, which will go in a separate pull request)\n. This should apply to both blocking and cookie-blocking the origin.\n. @garrettr points out: if someone adds an origin to userred, perhaps they expect all the subdomains to be blocked as well. Right now they are only cookieblocked.\n. Easiest solution: set the http-only flag on all 3rd party cookies unless whitelisted; remove the flag once the heuristic or the user has made a decision for that host. I wonder how many sites this will break.\nAnother solution is to check the lastAccessed property of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsICookie2 in onModifyRequest and count each update in lastAccessed as a strike in the heuristic blocker. We may erroneously count cookie modifications or reads that aren't communicated to the server but overcounting is better than undercounting.\n. taking this off the 0.1 milestone list\n. Closing for now.\n. I hear the Chrome version has had major improvements to the entropy detection, so we should steal their work. \n. @cooperq can you update the low entropy cookie detector in Firefox to match the one in Chrome?\n. Leaving this open for now because the entropy detection is still very rough. Ex: we need to count the entropy of the cookie name, not just the value. Moving to a 0.2 milestone.\n. note that this is different from #10 because that case should clear blockedOrigins as well\n. bugzilla: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=980714\n. Ok someone \"fixed\" it in the addon sdk though the caret still shows up sometimes. Closing for now!\n. closing because #41 is mostly a duplicate\n. @cooperq assigning you 1 and 2 for now.\n. It's pretty arbitrary. Every 5 min for an hour probably makes more sense.\n. fixed\n. I guess Garrett merged this while I was commenting. :( \nStill would prefer the style nits to get fixed.\n. This would close #39 \n. Don't merge yet, plz. Still fixing up a few things and refactoring.\n. Cool. I think this is ready to be merged, @garrettr. I'm going to start working on release scripts.\n. This is looking pretty good but I have one major concern: automatically checking for the privacy policy every 24 hours exactly can potentially make users very fingerprintable.ads.com can use the privacy policy check to track users by giving each user a unique set of subdomains or simply because every user will do the check at a unique time of day.\n. s/\"unique set of subdomains\"/\"unique set of domains\"  because the heuristic blocker only works on eTLD+1, oops. Perhaps that isn't something we should worry about yet.\nMaybe we can just randomize the time?\n. Though one complication is that https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy says to check for the whitelist on the host, not the eTLD+1. \n. Wait, if a domain is blocked, doesn't the XHR that checks for the privacy policy also get blocked? O.o\n. I can take care of making these fixes by cherry-picking some commits from this pull req. Thanks!\n. Plz rebase or merge master in.\n. I made some minor changes to the text for clarity. Let me know if either of you have thoughts.\n. This works for me perfectly on a fresh Firefox profile, but causes breakage when I make an XPI and install in my regular Firefox profile. It seems that messages never get sent to the popup panel. Sometimes the firstRun page doesn't show up at all after install (haven't figured out why). \n. I have a test case for this bug:\n1. Create xpi's for both this branch and master using cfx xpi.\n2. cfx run from this branch. Install the xpi from master - everything should work fine.\n3. Install the xpi from this branch. Now the popup is broken. (FWIW, firstRun.html didn't show up this time, though perhaps that is intentional behavior.)\nConsole logs, starting at Step 3:\nconsole.log: privacybadgerfirefox: Successful unload downgrade\nSystem JS : ERROR chrome://browser/content/content-sessionStore.js:230 - TypeError: docShell.Qu\neryInterface(...).sessionHistory is null\nSystem JS : ERROR chrome://browser/content/content-sessionStore.js:230 - TypeError: docShell.Qu\neryInterface(...).sessionHistory is null\nconsole.log: privacybadgerfirefox: ALL WINDOWS Array {0:..,1:..,2:.., }\nconsole.log: privacybadgerfirefox: Started up\nconsole.log: privacybadgerfirefox: Adding to whitelist: googleapis.com\netc\n. Seems like a bug in unload and somehow doesn't occur when you reinstall the same version (or install master after installing from this branch).\n. @garrettr That's fine, but the popup panel not showing up correctly is a blocker.\n. @garrettr I'm worried it's indicative of a deeper issue that might cause problems when users upgrade. The bug shows up when you install the XPI from master and then install the XPI from this pull request.\n. Ok, merging.\n. Cool, I don't think this is worthwhile for 0.1.\n. @pde that is a different bug actually, which has been reported for Linux in #59 \n.

See https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/pull/48#issuecomment-41857381.\n. In particular, having a precise time of day for each user makes it easy to associate local network information over time with the same user.\n. @garrettr Agreed that it should be mitigated anyway. Your algorithm LGTM!\nWould be great if you took this ticket.\n. Can you see Privacy Badger in about:addons?\n. Is that on both icecat 24 and firefox 29?\n. @mrtino @BigAl49 what operating systems are you using? do you have any other addons installed?\n. FYI, Garrett and I tested this out quite a bit on Debian/Ubuntu with Firefox 29, Firefox Beta, Firefox ESR, and Firefox Aurora. So it's not broken in the general case, which makes me think it might have to do with unusual browser settings/themes and other extensions installed.\n. @BigAl49 can you try starting a new Firefox profile and installing only Privacy Badger to see if it shows up? Instructions on how to create a new profile are at https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles#w_starting-the-profile-manager\nThanks!\n. Ok, that helps a lot! Maybe the addon bar just doesn't have enough space for everything.\n. Hi everyone, please check if your problems are still happening in the latest version: https://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.1.2.xpi\n. @mrtino That's related to #11 \n. @Migas7 If your issue is that Privacy Badger doesn't work with \"Don't remember history\", it's a duplicate of #11 (incognito windows are basically the same as that setting). We're working on it, but it's not an easy issue to fix, so it will be at least a week before I can get a release out.\nI'm going to close this issue because the toolbar icon was fixed, and it seems like everyone else here is experiencing #11. If there's a different bug, please open a new issue.\n. It's not clear that you understand why this issue was closed:\n\nAnd it's because I have set \"Never Remember History\" on my preferences, that the icon doesn't show. \n\nIt doesn't show up because Privacy Badger isn't active if you set Never Remember History, same as for Incognito mode (which is #11). This was a deliberate decision for the alpha release, because Privacy Badger remembers some state that could be considered \"History\" (it needs to keep a count, internally, of some sites that you've visited in order to make decisions about what to block). So if you set \"Never Remember History\", we have three choices:\n1. We can operate anyways, which arguably violates the user's choice to not remember any history.\n2. We can not operate at all - this is the option that fully respects their choice to ignore all browsing history. \n3. We can figure out a way to operate and yet still respect user preferences, perhaps with some sort of warning in the UI when Privacy Badger turns on.\nWe currently do 2 but are hoping to do 3.\n. (I closed this as a duplicate of #11 because when that issue is fixed, this one will be as well automatically. Confusingly, Firefox treats \"incognito\" mode similarly to regular mode with \"never remember history\" set.)\n. @Migas7 This issue was closed because it appears to be a duplicate of #11; the root cause is the same. I could open it and mark it as \"duplicate\" if there are sufficient advantages to doing so.\nAlpha software (especially the kind that was written by someone working part-time over the course of about 2 months) is bound to have bugs, not all of which will get fixed immediately. Thanks for testing.\nAlso, I have opened this bug with Mozilla, which should make things less confusing in the future: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1009194\n. @neverumind Thanks. The milestone on #11 should actually be the next release (0.1.4?) after the one today.\n. Hm, so in theory that means that if disqus is seen tracking you on multiple sites, we will block it from reading cookies instead of blocking it entirely. Can anyone confirm that this is happening and causing Disqus to break?\n. Though the OP's screenshot shows Disqus getting blocked entirely (!) https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BmomswRCUAAGnZs.png\n. Indeed. I am investigating.\n. I found the culprit! Everything works as expected, but we didn't anticipate that we need to whitelist all subdomains of a whitelisted domain as well! (clearly this is the case for disqus which uses a ton of subdomains)\n. @pde, my inclination is to do this fix in the next release and think about making the whitelist parsing regex-aware later. \n. Hi all, please upgrade to 0.1.1 and re-open this issue if youtube/disqus/etc are still broken. thanks!\n. (unfortunately there is a small chance you may have to click on the gear icon in the Pbadger panel and chose \"Unblock sites\" then \"Unblock all blocked sites\" for this to take effect)\n. I think that is due to caching. It was updating properly for me. If not, try clicking on https://s.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.1.1.xpi for now.\n. Yes, that is exactly what I would expect because Disqus uses cookies to log you in. It looks like we have to make a special category for Disqus and similar sites (\"never block\"). Thank you for testing.\n. Do you have a screenshot? Not surprised, we didn't test on Macs extensively. :/ \n. Uh-oh! cc @garrettr \n. 0.1.2 supposedly fixes this; please reopen if it's still broken! https://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.1.2.xpi\n. From the settings menu? Unfortunately that operation is un-undo-able right now. (Sorry this isn't clearer!)\nYou can click on the badger icon in the panel to disable privacy badger for the current site that you're visiting, which unblocks everything on that page.\nThanks for the feedback!\n. @Fry-kun: see if those show up after you refresh the page?\n. @Fry-kun It's possible that Pbadger isn't reporting anything because other extensions are blocking it already. I see inkoutbreak.com by itself if I have adblockplus and noscript enabled. Disabling both of those makes tons of things show up in Pbadger.\n(Not doubting that you have a real bug here, just pointing out that testing with multiple extensions installed is sometimes unpredictable.)\n. @Fry-kun: regarding the original bug you reported, I plan to fix it by adding a confirmation dialog that says, \"Are you sure you want to do this? This action cannot be undone.\" If you want to unblock everything temporarily, you can disable Privacy Badger and later re-enable it (it'll remember all blocking settings when you re-enable). \nYou can disable for a single site by clicking on the badger icon in the panel or globally in about:addons.\n. 0.1.2 supposedly fixes this; please reopen if it's still broken! https://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.1.2.xpi\n. Does 0.1.2 fix this? Please try https://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.1.2.xpi (cc @xapaho @Migas7)\n. This is probably an upstream Firefox issue, since we just use their built-in jetpack APIs. Marking as wontfix for now, unfortunately.\n. On second thought, it seems that https://www.eff.org/files/cookieblocklist.txt should really be a list of strings to match as suffixes of the FQDN, not \"either the host itself or the base domain\". Fixing now.\n. I agree we should be able to account on set-cookie headers but I don't think we can see js attempts easily. The way to do that would be to count attempts to query the cookie db but I don't know an API off the top of my head that gives that info. cc @garrettr \n. A better approach may be: if the user has turned off 3rd party cookies, set their pref back to \"allow\" but just have Privacy Badger cookieblock all third parties by default.\n. It seems like the only sane way to do this is to listen for \"set-cookie\" headers in http-on-examine-response, which misses cookies set over JS. We can get both HTTP and JS cookie sets by listening for 'cookie-rejected' but there's no direct way to read the rejected cookie or which window it was set in from there.\n. @pde Yes, it seems that you can get the domain sometimes. At other times the subject is undefined. Your approach makes sense only in addition to watching set-cookie headers, I think. We need to be able to show a rejected cookie domain as a yellow tracker in the UI whenever possible. \n. In short, watching Set-Cookie headers seems to be the only way to get a window associated with a cookie being set (thus allowing the tracker to show up in the UI), but listening to cookie-rejected is the only way to see set-cookie attempts by Javascript. It makes sense to do heuristic accounting based on cookie-rejected events if it's good enough to assume that (1) any request not associated with an open tab's top-level URL is third-party and (2) all cookies are high entropy. (Annoyingly, we can't see the name/value of the cookie being rejected.)\nA way to figure out which cookie sets were over js would be helpful.\n. @garrettr Your POC listens for cookie-changed, not cookie-rejected. cookie-changed doesn't get fired when access to the cookie db is denied for a domain, AFAICT. (I've tried similar things to your POC)\n. I don't think you can QI to nsICookie from cookie-rejected since the event subject is an nsIURI.\n. @garrettr Indeed, that is the approach I took. Check out https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/pull/90.\n. This is mostly a subset of #64 and is on the top of my to-do list.\n. Thanks for the feedback, of course. We don't operate in private browsing mode for now, mostly because it is difficult to do in a way that doesn't leak information into your normal browsing mode; see #11. \nThis is a feature for the next release though.\n. Closing as duplicate of #11 \n. This would be fixed by merging #63 (same issue as the one with Disqus), thanks for pointing it out.\n. I have fixed this and made a new release. Please update to 0.1.1 and re-open this if you still see the problem, thanks.\n. Unfortunately, right now Privacy Badger is pretty much useless if you've already blocked all third party cookies. We are trying to fix this in #64. \nHere are the tradeoffs of having Privacy Badger enabled vs blocking third party cookies by default:\n- If you enable privacy badger, 3rd party cookies are allowed by default until we detect that they are tracking you. Then we block third-party requests from the third party entirely, not just the cookies inside the requests.\n- If you block third party cookies always, Privacy Badger doesn't work, so requests to those third parties will still go through (they just won't have cookies associated with them). This may be concerning because third parties can track you without cookies, as long as you are sending requests to them.\nThe choice is up to you, but hopefully Privacy Badger will block all \"evil\" tracking third party cookies anyway after you browse for a while!\n. I am going to mark this as a duplicate of #64.\n. > @garrettr https://github.com/garrettr thanks for the comments.\n\nPlease note that the contents of the CONTRIBUTING.md file were taken\ndirectly from the README, so it might be a good idea to either ditch\nthat section or update it there.\nI can surely do that.\n\nThank you so much! I added those sections to README.md in a hurry\nbecause we had just launched, and I realized the README had no\ncontributing info. I will happily merge those changes back into\nREADME.md or just hyperlink to CONTRIBUTING.md.\n-Yan\n. Thanks! This looks great. Two suggestions:\n1. Please move this into ./doc.\n2. Please change the \"Contributing\" section in README.md to link to doc/Contributing.md\n. Thanks, this looks fine to me. Will merge in 1 day if Garrett has no comment.\n. 0.1.2 supposedly fixes this; please reopen if it's still broken! https://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.1.2.xpi\n. Are you sure that it's not just because PBadger is blocking some requests that AdBlockPlus would otherwise do a ton of processing on? I thought of this while reading https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2014/05/14/adblock-pluss-effect-on-firefoxs-memory-usage/. \n. Thanks for reporting. Have you upgraded to 0.1.1? (check about:addons)\n. Closing because I merged this into #76 \n. Hi, can you check which version you're using now? (should be in about:addons)\n0.1 had some known issues with blocking too many websites; you may have automatically upgraded to 0.1.1, which fixed the problem.\n. Hi, this is because Firefox <29 does not support the API that lets us automatically be in the top bar instead of the bottom one: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/ui\nBut note that Firefox 29 is now stable, so you should upgrade. Once you restart, PBadger should automatically be in the top bar.\nMarking this wontfix for now unless many Firefox ESR users are annoyed by the icon being in the bottom.\n. Somewhat relatedly: check parent domains recursively for cookieblocking, not just the host itself and the eTLD+1 (which is what we currently do).\n. Oops, indeed it does. Apparently I don't know how to use fancy smart Web 2.0 tools.\n. Are you switching between private browsing mode? See #11. It also disappears when you resize the window if you have other addons installed.\n. This is maybe-fixed. If not, please comment on #95. \n. Yep, just realized today that this may happen. Not sure why; maybe setting  ACCESS_ALLOW_FIRST_PARTY_ONLY overrides the flag that marks cookies to be deleted at the end of a session? Is this ACCESS_SESSION in https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/cookie/nsICookiePermission.idl? \nThe correct thing to do is to delete the cookie at the end of the session but remember that we had set it to ACCESS_ALLOW_FIRST_PARTY_ONLY.\nFirefox's cookie options are confusing. :/\n. @monicachew cool, I am fixing this by keeping a Set in the addon's local storage that remembers which per-site permissions were added by Privacy Badger. Which event should I listen to in order to delete the cookies for these sites on exit? (Currently set to \"quit-application-granted\")\n. Clearing cookies that we unintentionally made persistent in a listener for \"quit-application-granted\" seems to be working, except the cookies for the base domain (ex: scorecardresearch.com) are not getting deleted along with the ones for the subdomain (ex: sb.scorecardresearch.com). What's confusing is that when I look at the exceptions list in \"about:preferences\", I see \"sb.scorecardresearch.com\" but not \"scorecardresearch.com\". So I would have assumed that cookies for \"scorecardresearch.com\" wouldn't have been saved at all, but this is not the case. [EDIT: This is working now! Fault is mine, not Firefox's.]\nTo delete all cookies for the host, I'm use Services.cookies.getCookiesFromHost to get all the cookies and the remove method from nsICookieManager to delete them.\n. Fixed by #90.\n. @Blubarb the curved arrow next to the sliders means that you manually set those to be blocked (unless there's a bug). You can click on the curved arrow to undo your custom settings; hopefully then it'll work!\nNote that ytimg.com is on https://www.eff.org/files/cookieblocklist.txt, so Privacy Badger will never set it to red by default (only yellow). \n. @alaricd Do you mean \"block all 3rd party requests\" or \"block all 3rd party cookies\"? I think pde is correct that the former would break a lot of the web (think of all the CDN's, etc.) but blocking all 3rd party cookies is completely reasonable.\nIf you mean the latter, that will be possible in Firefox once I merge my patch for #64. \n. Are the Facebook trackers set to yellow or red? Did you set them, or were they auto-set by Privacy Badger?\n(BTW, in case it wasn't clear, you can disable Privacy Badger Firefox on just the current page by clicking the badger icon in the panel.)\n. You can also just click-and-drag the sliders to make them green (unblocks Facebook)\n. Also the text on the bottom (\"What is Privacy Badger?\") is way too large. You can tell I learned CSS while hacking on this project.\n. @garrettr Same here. The non-default prefs handling was a pain to deal with, and it's not clear to me that we have covered all the relevant non-default cases.\n. What should happen is that if you block a.com or a.com is blocked automatically (red), then sub.a.com is cookieblocked (yellow). You may have to refresh the page and re-open the panel to see the subdomains turn yellow. \n. Oh, that makes sense. If you manually set something to green, it automatically overrides the parent's settings. \nYou can undo this by clicking the \"Undo manual settings\" arrow next to the green domain. (Then it should get auto-blocked when you refresh the page)\n. No problem!\n. Whoa, that is really not good. Marking as bug.\n. @imaginaryfriend Are you either using private browsing mode or \"Never remember history\"? For ironic privacy reasons, Privacy Badger Alpha was designed to be inactive by default under those circumstances.\n. Yeah, the downside of a video is that it isn't git-trackable/localizable and some users (like me) are reluctant to watch them because you need headphones or plugins or etc.\nInspiration: http://www.useronboard.com/\n. On the other hand, a video would be a good pre-install promotion for the beta or later releases. I have heard that EFF does not like making videos though.\n. Pull Request #90 will make PBadger work correctly with session-only cookies [1]. But it still displays a warning if you set cookies to \"Ask me every time\" (which seems like an insane number of popups; does anyone actually use this setting?).\nAnyway, let me know if you think the new warning text is better: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/pull/90/files#diff-d29471a44439bcb36424d70e063733f3L364\n[1] Privacy Badger currently has a bug with \"delete all cookies on browser close\" where it remembers cookies that you've set to green between sessions (it also remembers red/yellow ones, but that is usually harmless since red/yellow sites can't read those cookies unless you visit them as a first-party). This will be fixed in the next release. See #85. \n. Closed because the warning is less dire now and appears only in very edge cases.\n. Can you take a screenshot of which things are blocked in Privacy Badger?\n. Sure, you can manually click on the sliders in the panel and set them to green (unblocked). You can also click on the Privacy Badger icon inside the panel to disable privacy badger on the current page.\nThis should become more clear in the next release or so.\n. That is a weird bug. Can you take a screenshot of what Privacy Badger looks like on that page?\n. In theory, if a page says \"Could not detect any tracking cookies\", it means that Privacy Badger is not blocking anything on that page.\nIf it says, \"Reload this page to see active trackers\", then either the sliders or the \"Could not detect any tracking cookies\" message should show up after you reload the current page. If it still says, \"Reload this page...\", then that's a bug.\nThanks for the screenshots.\n. I wonder if the reload issue is specific to Firefox 24 (I usually test on Firefox 29); it was also reported in #100 \n. @throm880 can I close this bug?\n. Reported on Windows as well, Firefox 24.5.\nI suspect this may be a Firefox 24 issue, since I haven't run into this in FF 29.\n. Two questions:\n1. Are you sure you are on Iceweasel? I didn't mark Privacy Badger 0.1.2 as compatible with any version of Iceweasel, so in theory, it's not possible to install in Iceweasel.\n2. Are you reloading by hitting enter in the URL bar, hitting the refresh icon, or some other means? It sometimes makes a difference. (For instance, hitting enter on a URL like www.foo.com#bar won't actually refresh the page.)\n. Hi, this is similar to #85, which was fixed in 0.1.3, released yesterday. We need to add cookies to the exception list when we handle them differently than the default Firefox behavior. The only negative side effect that I've found is when the user has chosen \"delete all cookies on browser close\", in which case we unintentionally override that behavior. This should have been fixed in 0.1.3 by adding a method that deletes all the cookies changed by Privacy Badger when the session ends if the user has that setting on.\n(You still may have to take out the exceptions manually that were added pre-0.1.3, or you can click on \"unblock all\" in the settings menu to clear Privacy Badger's data.)\nIf there's other unwanted side effects, unfortunately we have to pull hacks to avoid them. There seems to be no way to change cookie permissions without showing up in the exceptions list.\n. @z1572ad7b If you block a site in your exceptions, then Privacy Badger won't unblock it. User rules always have priority; if not, it's a bug and will be fixed as soon as I get around to it.\n. Marking as wontfix instead of closing because it's true that we still add entries to the cookie exceptions list; haven't found a way of getting around this (but at least we clear cookies on browser close if needed now).\n. Are you able to look at the network requests in the devtools panel and see if there are indeed cookies being sent to those domains?\n. Also, if you are using PBadger prior to version 0.1.3 and have set \"Don't accept third party cookies\" in Firefox, you won't see the trackers in the panel.\n. Here's my results from some quick testing.\nChrome, latest PBadger release:\n- PBadger shows trackers for \"www.google.com\", \"addons.cdn.mozilla.net\", and \"www.paypalobjects.com\". \n- The devtools panel shows requests going to all of those domains, but only \"www.google.com\" got cookies.\nFirefox, PBadger 0.1.3:\n- PBadger shows a tracker for \"www.google.com\".\n- Devtools panel looks about the same; no cookies except to \"www.google.com\"\nSo it seems like the Firefox behavior for me is correct. I'm not sure why you're not seeing \"www.google.com\"; maybe browser caching for those resources?\n. @dwecerberus Thanks for furthur testing. I don't see any cookies being sent in any of the screenshots you provided, or am I misreading? If there are cookies, they show up as a \"Cookie\" field in \"Request Headers\".\nThe intended behavior is that we don't label domains as tracking you if their requests don't contain cookies.\n. @dwecerberus FWIW, I don't have either of those extensions and got mostly the same results as in your screenshots. While it's true that third parties can track you without the use of cookies, we currently have not implemented detection of those, so the non-cookie third parties showing up as \"trackers\" in Chrome seems like a bug. :)\n. I talked to @cooperq and he confirmed that Chrome is showing all the 3rd party domains instead of just the ones setting cookies. We loosely agreed that it is better to show only the ones setting cookies, because the panel says, \"Detected trackers from these domains\".\nClosing now; thanks for the help!\n. Interesting. Do you have a bookmarklet I can use as a test case?\n. marking this as maybe-fixed\n. Thanks for including links, versions, and workarounds! :)\nFor 1, I think the long-term solution is to have a data structure in our heuristic blocking algorithm that expresses which origins should be considered equivalent to each other. Disconnect has done some of that work: https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect/blob/012d577edb50eb096a3cafd9005871ba438075c4/firefox/content/disconnect.safariextension/opera/chrome/data/services.json. Depending on how many site bugs this would fix, it could either be a 0.2 or a 1.0 milestone.\n2 is similar to the issue with Disqus and Facebook comments not working, both of which have been reported. We have to just whitelist them somehow unless they choose to post DNT compliance policies.\n. I did not realize video ads could be so annoying!\nI reproduced this bug when I set all of the sliders to red in Privacy Badger. The video would play correctly once I set them to yellow. For now, you could either manually figure out which ones are causing the video to freeze and set them from red to yellow, or you can click \"Disable on current page\" in the privacy badger settings panel (click on the gear icon).\n. You can sort-of do this in Firefox but not very easily right now. The steps are:\n1. Find your profile directory in Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data#w_how-do-i-find-my-profile\n2. From there, go into ./jetpack/jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack/simple-storage.\n3. Open store.json and parse out the blocked entities, which should be under userRed (sites manually set to red), userYellow (sites manually set to yellow), and blockedOrigins (sites automatically set to red or yellow). I'm not sure if there is a text editor that makes it easy to read JSON files.\n. That's weird. I don't know what Hola does that would interfere with Privacy Badger; unfortunately, it is very difficult to find out because their product is closed-source and their End User License Agreement forbids reverse-engineering: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/hola/license/1.1.469.\n. Can you copy-and-paste the error messages? Does this happen immediately when PBadger is installed or only after PBadger has been running for a while? We don't act like a VPN but sometimes we block connections to some domains. (when they are determined to be tracking you)\nWill investigate more later.\n. Uh, you should probably stop using Hola: http://motherboard.vice.com/read/your-tool-to-access-netflix-content-abroad-is-hijacking-your-internet-connection\n. Thanks for reporting this. I'm not sure why we didn't just change the Firefox DNT pref upon install to begin with, but I've fixed it in #106. \n. Closing.\n. I don't think that's necessarily a convention for Firefox extensions, though it might be more intuitive. AdBlock Plus, NoScript, and HTTPS Everywhere are all in the toolbar.  (In standard UX terms, this is called a \"browser action\", whereas an icon in the address bar is a \"page action\".)\nFirefox's addon APIs don't really support page actions except on mobile (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Firefox_for_Android/API/NativeWindow/pageactions). Some quick Googling came up with a hack to get page action-y: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla-labs-jetpack/GK8phu0pe1Q.\nI'm inclined to mark this wontfix until Firefox desktop supports page action nicely.\n. Interesting. Do you have any custom Firefox privacy preferences set? Ex: only remember cookies for a session.\n. Thanks. Also, does this happen with a fresh install of Privacy Badger?\n. Great, one more question: Does this also happen w/ 0.1.2? (link: https://eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.1.1.xpi)\n. oops, make that https://eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.1.2.xpi\n. Looking into this now. The fact that wordpress is on cookieblocklist.txt means that we've \"whitelisted\" the domain and its subdomains to never be completely blocked by Privacy Badger, just cookieblocked. What I would expect to happen is that users who have Privacy Badger installed eventually end up losing logged-in functionality (b/c Wordpress cookies are getting blocked), but that should return if they manually set the Wordpress domains to green. \nWhen I visit http://en.support.wordpress.com/third-party-cookies/ and open Privacy Badger, I see \"wtptc.com\" set to yellow, and the page says that cookies are disabled. Then I manually set wtptc.com to green, and it says that cookies are enabled, as expected.\n. @macmanx2 Everything is green in Privacy Badger until the domain is observed to be setting cookies for you on 3 or more first-party sites. This means that Privacy Badger is going to show everything as green until you've had enough sufficient browsing history for it to decide what to block.\n. Oddly enough, I have not been able to repro this bug.\n1. Made a new firefox 29.0.1 profile.\n2. Installed privacy badger from eff.org/privacybadger\n3. Logged into my wordpress account.\n4. Observed admin bar working on both http://en.blog.wordpress.com/ and http://macmanx.com/\n5. Quit and re-launch Firefox.\n6. Observed admin bar working on both http://en.blog.wordpress.com/ and http://macmanx.com/\nI am using Debian Jessie.\n. Wow, I've never gotten a screencast in a bug report before, thanks!\nThere are two things going on here that need to be fixed (one is intentional right now, one is probably a bug):\n1. We need to never cookie-block wordpress in the first place for the logged-in functionality to work by default. A way to fully whitelist domains is being worked on for 0.2. (Obviously it's very annoying to make users have to manually set things to green.)\n2. Manually setting something to green after it gets cookie-blocked doesn't seem to actually return the cookie to the domain. However, it works after \"unblock all trackers\".\nI'll try to fix 2 now.\n. I have reproduced this bug and also verified that setting domains to green does in fact cause their cookies to be sent (as expected), so it's still not clear why the logged-in functionality is not appearing. Do you know which third-party Wordpress cookies in particular cause a user to be \"logged in\"?\nMy guess is that this bug only appears after restart because Wordpress is initially using a session cookie for login, which gets deleted when the browser closes. \n. update: I found a workaround for this, which is to disable the \"r-login.wordpress.com\" tracker and then re-enable it (set to green).\nFor some reason it keeps showing up as green by default even though it's actually being cookieblocked.\n. just for documentation:\n1. when cookies for r-login.wordpress.com are blocked, the tracker shows up as green (incorrectly) and the request returns 200.\n2. when cookies for r-login.wordpress.com are unblocked, the tracker doesn't show up at all and the request returns with a 302 redirect to a remote-login endpoint on the first-party page.\nA maybe-plausible explanation for 2 is that 302 redirected channels to the first party don't register as third-party channels in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/mozIThirdPartyUtil#isThirdPartyChannel%28%29. \n. @macmanx2 I think the way the whitelist is intended to work right now, r-login.wordpress.com would still get cookieblocked. We are working on making a separate whitelist for domains that should not be cookieblocked.\nBy the way, I noticed that the logged-in functionality never appears for me even without privacy badger because I have disabled 3rd party cookies by default in Firefox.\n. > Is there anything we could do or provide besides just waiting for a domain whitelist so r-login.wordpress.com could be added to it?\nIf you post https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy at r-login.wordpress.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt, we will never block that domain. :)\n. Most likely this is because you have enabled private browsing mode by default or set \"Never Remember History\". (See #11 for tracking progress on fixing this bug.)\n. Closing due to lack of info. Presumably fixed by #11.\n. This is probably solved by adding kh.google.com to https://www.eff.org/files/cookieblocklist.txt. I will ping the people who can do that.\n. Does it work now?\n. Fixed now along with #115 possibly?\n. We actually aren't enabled at all in Private Browsing mode right now, so there is no obvious reason we would be causing Firefox crashes.\n. We're now active in Private Browsing as of 0.1.4. Do you see crashes if you enable it?\n. @Makitk This may be related to the weird fix that I made for #85. Did you set your firefox preferences to \"keep cookies until I close firefox\" with exceptions added for the sites that you login from?\nPrivacy Badger is supposed to destroy the cookies that it has added to the exceptions list when the session ends if you've chosen that setting. (The reason it adds cookies to the exceptions list at all is an annoying side effect of how Firefox handles cookie permissions as exceptions to the default behavior.)\nSo if you've added a cookie to the exceptions list yourself and Privacy Badger has also added it [1], the cookie will get destroyed at the end of the session. I didn't think this would be a likely scenario, but it's not hard to fix.\n[1] This should only happen for trackers that show up as yellow/red in the panel. It also happens if you've manually set a tracker to green. \n. @Makitk Ok, I'm curious if this will fix anything:\n1. Go to the settings menu in Privacy Badger (the gear icon in the upper right of the panel)\n2. Click \"Unblock all trackers\" and confirm (unfortunately, this will reset Privacy Badger to its initial state, but given that you are blocking 3p cookies by default anyway, it's not too bad).\n3. Go into the Firefox privacy preferences menu and add any exceptions that were missing. \nIn theory those exceptions should be preserved when you exit.\n. Ok, I have tried to reproduce this bug on a fresh profile with Firefox 24.5 (ESR) without success. I installed pbadger 0.1.3, set \"block 3p cookies\" and \"clear cookies on close\", added an exception for google.com, logged into gmail, quit the browser, started it, and was still logged into gmail.\nCan you check that the cookies are actually gone (preferences > privacy > show cookies) after you restart the browser?\n. Yeah, thanks for reporting! I've opened a bug to add Twitch to https://www.eff.org/files/cookieblocklist.txt: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/issues/182. Hopefully that fixes it.\n. Hmm, the video on vinesauce seems to work fine for me.\n. I was able to repro this and fix by setting 'spreadsheets.google.com' to yellow. Opened https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/issues/184.\n. This seems like an upstream bug, since we're just using the basic addon-sdk widget API. @garrettr \n. Agreed. Adding to ui-nits list.\n. Mostly a duplicate of #95 \n. I am getting the correct result for third-partiness in 302's  to the first party using ThirdPartyUtil.isThirdPartyURI with channel.URI and the URI of the top window associated with the channel.\nThis is not a great solution because getting the top-level window URI for a channel is unreliable and will often return an obsolete location (!).\nTorButton had a similar issue (https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8167) which was solved by applying a Firefox patch that extended mozThirdPartyUtil.\nIt would be great for us to have this too. Anyone reading this should star https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=962326. \n. Oh, actually this appears to be invalid. It turns out that if you are logged in, Wordpress does a first-party redirect. \nReading interpreting the devtools network panel correctly is hard. :/\n. Have you tested that it actually doesn't install on seamonkey?\n. At least some of the Jetpack APIs that we use appear to be incompatible with Seamonkey. Upon marking as installable in Seamonkey and installing, I get the error:\nconsole.error: privacybadgerfirefox: \n  Message: Error: Unsupported Application: The module sdk/tabs/tabs currently supports only Fir\nefox, Fennec.\nGiven that it would take a lot of effort to switch from using Jetpack APIs to direct XPCOM for Seamonkey, I'm marking this wontfix for now, \n. Note that this causes the tests to require network connectivity.\n. Added more test coverage. This seems ready to me.\n. oh no, I love stripe. but it looks like they've just been added to https://www.eff.org/files/cookieblocklist.txt, so it should be okay now. (you may have to restart your browser or disable-then-reenable PBadger to fetch the new list)\n. Not sure what is going on here, but probably invalid.\n. no comment, I'm going to close for now.\n. (1) == change location of active tab to FAQ page?\n(2) == hide the privacy badger panel?\n. @pde ^\n(do you only get notification emails if you're mentioned in a comment?)\n. It trims the domain name at the max number of characters my panel could show minus 4 or so. So this is not something everyone would see, but still probably should get fixed.\n. Made the maximum # of characters lower.\n. Interesting. IIRC, safe browsing requests are considered first-party in Firefox (assuming they are XHRs from the main Firefox process as opposed to a particular page). Nonetheless, I agree that they are a privacy concern.\nMarking this as enhancement, but probably low priority for now until we get to the point where we want to start porting over privacy features from Tor Browser.\n. Click on the badger icon in the panel.\nWe should make that more obvious.\n. Yeah, those two are equivalent. I added the text in menu after it seemed like some people would never hover over the icon.\n. Cool, closing as duplicate.\n. We've added stackexchange and stackoverflow to https://www.eff.org/files/cookieblocklist.txt. Can you check that this is now fixed?\n. Relatedly: \"Disable on this page\" should return cookies for the resources on the disabled page. Currently the cookies are still blocked.\nThere is no easy way to selectively allow third party cookies for a given first party. Probably there will be an http-on-modify request listener that checks whether the top window for the channel is a disabled site, then injects cookies if so. \n(These are unrelated bugs but will probably be fixed in the same pull request.)\n. Not easily. You can follow the instructions at https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/109#issuecomment-43276341, then in store.json, look for user{Red, Yellow, Green}.\n. ?\n. Have you tried seeing if \"disable on this page\" fixes it?\n. Opened https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/issues/205\n. Still broken?\n. Haven't seen this yet. Do you have an example of such a website?\n. Opened https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/issues/204\n. Still broken?\n. LOL, it's part of the normal badger image.

Cool! This mostly looks great.\nCouple of issues that can be fixed post-merge:\n- Style nit: lots of trailing whitespace at end of lines (annoying to people who set highlight ExtraWhitespace in vim).\n- Probably tempUnblockMap can be refactored into a property of settingsMap.\n- Consider showing temporarily-unblocked widgets as green in the UI instead of red.\n. Thanks!\n. In theory it should be simple to package Privacy Badger for Firefox on Android - not sure offhand how to do it as an Firefox OS app.\n. Is the list of blockers different in chrome and firefox? Their state (red, yellow, green) depends on your browsing history, so it's very possible that something is blocked by the algorithm in Firefox but not Chrome.\n. @LordDewi thanks for the details. I think this should fix it: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/issues/224\n@galmoughraby It also appears that you have 3rd party cookies disabled by default in Firefox but not Chrome?\n. also seeing (maybe related?):\nconsole.error: privacybadgerfirefox: \n  Message: TypeError: callback is undefined\n  Stack:\n    onEvent@resource://gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm -> jar:file:///home/yan/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE/extensions/jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi!/bootstrap.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/loader/sandbox.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/content/content-worker.js:45:9onEvent@resource://gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm -> jar:file:///home/yan/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE/extensions/jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi!/bootstrap.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/loader/sandbox.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/content/content-worker.js:45:9\nonChromeEvent@resource://gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm -> jar:file:///home/yan/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE/extensions/jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi!/bootstrap.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/loader/sandbox.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/content/content-worker.js:96:9\n. another console error:\nconsole.error: privacybadgerfirefox: \n  Message: TypeError: value is not a non-null object\n  Stack:\n    exports.getSocialWidgetContentScriptData/<@resource://gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm -> jar:file:///home/yan/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE/extensions/jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi!/bootstrap.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-at-jetpack/privacybadgerfirefox/lib/socialWidgetHandler.js:63:1\nexports.getSocialWidgetContentScriptData@resource://gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm -> jar:file:///home/yan/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE/extensions/jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi!/bootstrap.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-at-jetpack/privacybadgerfirefox/lib/socialWidgetHandler.js:58:3\n. @froeschele do you have time to look at this issue?\n.

Opened https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/issues/221\n. What should the UI be for \"tracker that is only unblocked on this site\"?\nEasiest would be to make it appear the same as usergreen on the site where it is unblocked and green/red/yellow otherwise. If the user then manually changes the tracker's state on any site, the change applies to all sites.\n. Yeah, things go awry when multiple non-cooperative extensions and settings are influencing permissions in the same cookies database. :/\nLuckily we duplicate some of the functionality of Self-Destructing cookies insofar as setting a cookie to \"yellow\" in Privacy Badger prevents the cookie from being accessed except in the first-party context. And we manually delete those cookies on exit if your default setting is to clear cookies when the browser closes.\nIf the main problem is that we are preventing self-destructing cookies from self-destructing if they're caught by the privacy badger heuristic blocker, then the solution isn't too bad: we keep track of which cookies were marked ACCESS_SESSION to begin with and manually delete those on browser close if we modified them.\nAll this is me assuming that Self-Destructing Cookies uses nsICookiePermission like us: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/cookie/nsICookiePermission.idl\n. I don't have a good answer, but if you really want all cookies to be deleted on closing the tab (even first-party ones), you should probably use Self-Destructing Cookies. Privacy Badger doesn't do anything for cookies in a first-party context.\nBut personally, I would set \"block all 3rd party cookies\" by default in Firefox and then use Privacy Badger. The more restrictive default setting means that almost all tracking sites will never get my cookies anyway.\nPrivacy Badger also blocks requests entirely when a site is tracking you, which Self-Destructing Cookies doesn't do.\n. I'll fix these issues and some other linting and merge.\n. Interesting idea. Do you think it should be a new tab or an overlay on the current tab?\n. This is a duplicate of #126. \n. What is Do Not Track? Is it this: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/donottrackplus/ ?\nThey should be compatible as far as I can tell.\n. Hi, see #85 and #103. In short, we add entries to the cookie exception list as an unintentional side effect but they're not actually getting exempted. If you look at the network requests for Google, there should be no cookies going through.\n. I think whitelisted scheme checks belong here.\n. Currently there's no handler for the \"cookieblock\" event, but I can add that.\n. I would rather have the event emitters separated from the shouldBlockRequest check, which we will probably want to use without updating the UI for tests.\n. ? We don't need to strip cookies, because I'm using nsICookiePermission to deny access to set/read third party cookies. Right now this happens when a domain is added to userYellow, but it should probably hook onto cookieblock/usercookieblock events.\n. (Note that stripping cookies isn't a full solution because javascript can set/read cookies.)\n. As far as I can tell from looking at the code and bugzilla comments, yes. If it doesn't, then Firefox's internal third party cookie blocker doesn't either.\n. But I'm not sure if setting a cookie permission for example.com applies that same permission to www.example.com. My intuition is that we should block cookies to *.example.com if we block them for example.com.\n. Ok, sounds good.\n. They get stripped in onModifyRequest by setting channel.referrer to the empty string\n. Haha, you were the one who told me that for..of doesn't work for the version of js used for addons. Ok, will factor out the i.\n. That explains why it didn't syntax-highlight correctly for me either. Thanks.\n. clobberCookie gets called when something is added to userYellow.\n. ugh, unfortunately iterating over an array works even more stupidly. ex: \nfor (let i in [1,2,3]) {console.log(i);} // \"0\" \"1\" \"2\"\nGoing to stick with the hasOwnProperty idiom.\n. Nit: style consistency. https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/blob/master/doc/style.md\n. Nit: Please use braces.\n. Nit: please use consistent spaces between tokens.\n. Nit: semicolon needed. I generally use JSHint to catch some of these.\n. Better to use storage.addGreen (ensures that the origin is removed from yellow/red, which also ensures that the cookie is unclobbered if origin was in userYellow).\n. Is the indentation messed-up here or am I going blind? :O\n. no .js?\n. no .js?\n. Willfix, thx\n. Can we stick with the old text for now? IMO this is too verbose (and anything that is longer than one line will cause the header to shift up when the user hovers over a clickable element).\n. This shouldn't get deleted. The detected class is still referenced, and it's necessary to make the tracker status be centered.\n. on second thought, I prefer the tooltip styling the way it looked before. The black background makes it harder to read for me.\n. I like the new behavior of not changing the text when the user changes position on the slider, though. Can we keep that but revert to the old styling?\n. This has some side effects:\n- when the user clicks on the button in the settings menu to clear user decisions, this will delete the whitelist-from-privacy-policy origins.\n- when the user adds an origin to red or yellow, it gets removed from userGreen, so the whitelisted origin is no longer whitelisted. Actually, this is probably the right thing to do.\n. I think we need to check that the origin isn't already in userYellow or userRed, otherwise if it posts a valid privacy policy, it would get moved to userGreen (and off userYellow/Red). \n. I'll take care of randomizing this and then merge everything.\n. I wonder why this happens when you run the tests but not for me.\n. IIRC, this was never meant to be in the alpha; we decided it would be maybe useful for a later release but added unnecessary complexity for now. So this commenting-out should have happened before 0.1.\n. This would be a good refactoring. We may need some of their filter-parsing code later.\n. I added a commit that partially fixes this. FWIW, these methods aren't used except when the user chooses \"unblock my/all blocked origins\" from the settings menu; I'm thinking of taking this out once we make it possible to change settings for a domain and all its subdomains with one click.\nThis was also intended to maybe-be-used in a cleanup method that gets called before uninstall.\n. Is this fixed by specifying true as the third argument to button.addEventListener in order to prevent the event from bubbling up the DOM tree?\n. s/window/win\n. s/window/win\nI'd assume that onLocationChange is called when a tab is closed, but it's worth double-checking. Otherwise clearTemporaryUnblocks needs to listen for tab closing, browser quit, etc.\n. To be on the safe side, tempUnblockMap should get deleted when the user clicks on \"Unblock all trackers\" in the settings menu.\n. Is it really necessary for this to be here?\n. I see errors that head is sometimes null.\n. If I understand correctly, the setTimeouts are necessary to \"force\" the button-replacing to happen only when all of the resources on the page have been loaded and/or added to the settingsMap block-lists. The tab API docs are unclear on whether the attached content script fires when the DOM content is loaded or when all page resources are loaded; if it's the former, perhaps setting initialize as a callback for window.onload resolves the race condition.\nIf not, it seems that a better way to do this is to call createReplacementButtonImage whenever \"block\" or \"userblock\" are emitted by the main extension code (rather than try to wait until everything has been collected in settingsMap). \n. I thought that too. It's weird that I see it.\n. Ok, no real rush. Thanks!\n. Minor typo: \"blocking\"\n. \"!==\" to compare with null in order to avoid type-conversion. probably just if (head) in this case.\n. \"!==\" to avoid type conversion\n. \"!==\" to avoid type conversion\n. nope, just my typo. thanks for the pull req. looks good to me.\nChristopher Shea notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIn lib/utils.js:\n\n@@ -203,7 +203,7 @@ exports.getParentDomain = function(uri) { > * @return {Boolean} > */ > exports.checkEachParentDomainString = function(uri, stringCallback, ignoreSelf) { > - let ignoreSelf = ignoreSelf || false; > + var ignoreSelf = ignoreSelf || false; \n\nTrue, but there are other places in this file where var is used when redefining a variable passed as an argument.

It's there to ensure that companies can't track your browsing without your consent.</p> \n<p>This extension is designed to automatically protect your privacy from third party trackers that load invisibly when you browse the web. We send the Do Not Track header with each request, and our extension evaluates the likelihood that you are still being tracked. If the algorithm deems the likelihood is too high, we automatically block your request from being sent to the domain. Our extension has three states. Red means block the tracker. Yellow means that we don't send cookies or referers to the tracker. Green means unblocked (probably because the third party does not appear to be tracking you). Please understand that Privacy Badger is in beta, and the algorithm's determination is not conclusive that the domain is tracking you. You can toggle the states by clicking the privacy badger icon in your browser's address bar if you wish to override the settings. Or, you can browse in peace as Privacy Badger starts finding and eating up web trackers one by one. </p>\n<p> Nothing can stop the Privacy Badger from eating cookies when it's hungry!</p>\n<p> Privacy Badger is a project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>`\n. I like the changes that Yan made to the text, better flow to it now.  I will port these over to chrome as well\n. Fixed by 0628e0788874fcd551fa650d845af075c18e3ce6\n. Closing this issue since there was no response. Please make a new issue if you are still having problems.\n. I think that the solution to this is to make #165 happen. Closing this since I feel it is redundant. Feel free to reopen if you disagree @diracdeltas \n. It may also usefull to sort them by their state, i.e. have blocked domains at the top, cookieblocked domains in the middle and allowed domains at the bottom. \n. Closing this as a duplicate of #165 please continue discussion there.\n. This seems to be fixed now. \n. The icon has been redesigned as of 1.0\n. :+1: I think that this is an excellent idea.  I believe that a video would give us a bettter opportunity to explain the 'why' and 'what' of privacy badger in addition to the how.  The advantage of an interactive tutorial however would be that it is easier to localize and update.  I think that this is a good target for the beta release personally.\n. This is certainly still something that is needed! I was thinking a slideshow explaining how privacy badger works and how you can use it would be great but I'm happy to hear your ideas as well.\n. fixed in #423 \n. @fmarier, seems like this should be fixed now since you added the DNT policy. Thanks for that btw! I am going to close this now.\n. for now fixing this by adding kataweb.it to the cookieblock list\n. Apparently blocking cookies on 140cc.v.fwmrm.net solves this problem. I have added it to the cookie block list.\n. It sounds like we are blocking the domain that hola needs to connect to to work. I will look into this further, perhaps adding it to the cookie block list will fix the issue.\n. @liamtr is this still a problem for you? I have been unable to reproduce this. \n. We recently made a deliberate design decision in chrome to move the icon to a browser action so that we could get a nice counter of the number trackers on the page. I would like to implement this in firefox too so I am going to close this issue for now.\n. @macmanx2 did you guys ever end up adopting our dnt policy? \n. @pganssle @vrillusions This is definitely a problem, and I would like to resolve it. I have been unable to duplicate the bug so far however. What version of privacy badger and firefox are you using?  Can you start with a fresh profile and write down the exact steps needed to duplicate this problem?\n. awesome! Excellent reproduction steps! I will test it myself but from your description I think that this case might also be related to #551, I will see if my fixes for that also fix this issue. \n. when you visit github.com can you tell me which domains privacy badger is blocking and cookieblocking? (or send a screenshot)?\n. okay, this seems to be another manifestation of #648 \nthe main issue here is that subdomains of github.com should NEVER be blocked on their own domain. This is now my highest priority. \n. This should be fixed now, please open another issue if it is not.\n. I have reopened it and will test privacy badger on seamonkey\n. @mylittleplaceholder is also interested in this.\n. If someone wants to submit a patch marking this as compatible with seamonkey I will happily merge it. \n. I did! and I marked the version in AMO as compatible with seamonkey... can you try downloading the sefl hosted version from https://eff.org/privacybadger\ncan you also unpack the version from AMO and tell me whats in the install.rdf \n. AMO is addons.mozilla.org, privacy badger can be downloaded here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/\nI will have to look into why the self hosted version didn't get the changes that I made. \n. Weird, I makred it as compatible with seamonkey on AMO. I will look into this further. \n. Here is the listing on AMO, which says it's compatible with seamonkey. I don't really know what else I can do. \n\n. Yes there should be a badger icon that you can click on to see a list of all the trackers being blocked. \n. If someone wants to submit a pull request adding an item to a normal menu they are welcome to. I don't personally have time to work on it. \n. I would open the faq in a new tab instead of the currently active tab. \nOn May 28, 2014 4:54:25 PM PDT, Yan Zhu notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@pde ^\n(do you only get notification emails if you're mentioned in a comment?)\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/130#issuecomment-44479546\n\n\nSent from my Android device with K-9 Mail.

I think I might have fixed this particular one. \n. it will! thanks!\n. fixed in EFForg/privacybadgerchrome@7c1d1bef0ea5cd8ab5cca70c16da6aac6c7f33db\n. This is what I have been doing for chrome. I think it also reflects what the user would expect to happen as well.\nI also do not bring up the popup if the user has already expressed a preference (for example if the user has manually blocked apis.google.com I do not show them the popup.)\n. I have been working on this in https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/tree/feature/issue-165\nIt is almost completely working except for one huge problem. For the purposes of cookie blocking domains we are adding them to the list of third party cookie exceptions in firefox and marking them as first party only. When we add a domain to the list of exceptions it's cookies get loaded briefly and then get taken out by firefoxes third party cookie exception logic.\nThe quick workaround to this is to not include the 'allow this third party on this site only' option from the dialog. The better but longer workaround is to not add domains to the list of exceptions. I like this option better since I think that adding to the list of exceptions has caused confusion and bugs in some other cases as well.\nThis should probably be thought through more and discussed with @diracdeltas \n. This issue is due to what is happening in #206, fixing that will fix this. \n. closed via #425 \n. Added squarespace to the cookie block list.\n. If you have a non-tracking domain that privacy badger is blocking please open a new issue telling us what that domain is, so that we can consider adding it to privacy badger's 'greylist'.\n. There is a whitelist feature you can manage yourself already! If you click on the privacy badger icon you can unblock any of the domains by moving them from red to yellow (block cookies only) or green (unblock).  I hope this helps! Soon we will have clearer documentation about how this works.\n. Is this still a problem for you? If so can you tell me which domains privacy badger is blocking on the raspberry pi page?\n. Nope, it was merely a false positive. I have added shopify to the cookie block list. \n. Really? Even after you set the instapaper sliders to green you still get the warning from instapaper? That is pretty weird. I will look into this further. \n. @LouCypher666 The Do Not Track that you are referring to is a browser plugin that has nothing to do with us. The Do Not Track that we are referring to is a web standard that was devised by the W3C. It sends a header of 'DNT: 1' with every web request. This asks companies not to track you. You can read more about it here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_track_header\nI agree with Yan that they should be compatible, though Privacy Badger alone is probably enough.\n. I think either one of these solutions would be good, I can also see some\nother advantages to including a blacklist from disconnect.me or abp in\naddition to our heuristic.  Are there any compelling arguments why we\nshould not include an externally maintained blacklist in privacy badger?\n. Unfortunately we can't do a black list for a few reasons. I think the better option is to have a link show up if all trackers are green that ways \"why isn't anything blocked yet\" which could link to an FAQ item explaining how heuristic blocking works.  If this was implemented for either of the browsers I could port it to the other one. \n. Hmmm, I'm not sure, I have never actually tried to run the tests on windows. You raise a good point and I would be happy to accept a pull request containing windows build scripts, but I don't have time to work on this myself.\n. I think that this issue could be solved by two things, having a better onboarding experence, as in #96 and porting over the changes @SomMeri made to the chrome version, showing a help message when nothing is blocked yet. \n. This is dependent on #434 and #439 \nOnce we have those in I am going to close this. \n. This is now fixed.\n. This appears to be a firefox problem and not a privacy badger problem.  Try deleting your firefox profile and creating a new one. More information here: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=2425973\n. I can not reproduce this issue, which domains are blocked when you visit careers.stackoverflow.com ?\n. Added sstatic.com to the cookie block list. That should fix this issue.\n. Can you tell me what first party domain this is happening on?\n. unable to reproduce this, closing for now.\n. This is a duplicate of #201 so I am closing it.\n. This does not seem to be a problem any more for me.  I was able to make a document and sync it with the default privacy badger settings. Are you still experiencing this error?\n. I have added password box to the list of sites that the user can opt-in to whitelisting.  This will take effect in chrome soon. In firefox I still need to add this feature, but when I add it this will work.\n. Cool, thanks!\n. Can you tell me which third party domains privacy badger is blocking when you visit zive.cz?  You can determine this by clicking on the privacy badger icon, any domain where the slider is red is being blocked. \n. Looks like adding mfstatic.cz to the cookie block list solves this problem.\n. the red status that we refer to in firstRun.html is the color of the slider when you click the privacy badger icon. If you click the icon you will see a dropdown of all the potential tracking domains that privacy badger has seen so far. For each slider red means blocked, yellow means cookies are blocked, and green means unblocked.\n. Sorry for the confusion about this. We are working on an updated first run page.\n. I have added this domain to the cookie block list.\n. One request is enough for both, we will take a look at it. Thanks!\n. I have added this domain to the cookie block list.\n. Currently we do not support Firefox for android, however this is something that we may support in the future.  I would happily accept a pull request to make that work however!\n. These errors should be fixed in the latest version of privacy badger for firefox.\n. This is the same as #206 \n. Hmm, I can see this causing lots of problems. For example say someone has turned on pandora or spotify to play music while they do some non computery task, or what if they are watching a long video on youtube?  If we were going to do something like this, it would have to be opt in and it would have to be able to be disabled for certain sites.  But as it stands I think it would break too many things to include a feature like  this.\n. Added to the cookie block list\n. This is definitely a feature I could see us adding eventually, along with the ability to export the list.\n. fixed in #371 \n. The new version will be out soon! You can wait for that :)\n. I added lithium to the cookie block list.\n. Alex, what version are you using for chrome? In chrome when you click the comment box on youtube a dialog should pop up asking if you want to allow google plus for you tube, does that not happen?\n. Temporarily this can  be fixed by allowing (sliding to green) apis.google.com in your copy of privacy badger.  The real fix to this is to get #165 done so that you can enable apis.google.com easily and only for youtube.com\n. This problem should be fixed as of now. The release that I made today adds a feature where you can choose to unblock google+ which allows you to comment on youtube. \n. Thanks, but this is out of scope for privacy badger, the browser should be blocking these popups. The fact that it is not is troubling though. Perhaps a bug should be opened with mozilla.\n. I have added pixietrixcomix.com to the cookie block list\n. There is no sass file for this, I think it was pulled in from another project. Go ahead and make a pull request if you wish.\n. This warning comes up when you have tihrd party cookie settings set to \"ask every time\" or \"expire after a certain amount of time\".  Since we don't know which exact setting causes this (and we may add more in the future) I will leave the message as it is for now.\n. this is caused by the same things as #103 and #238 and #167 which is namely that privacy badger handles the cookie block list by adding things to the internal firefox list of cookie exceptions. The real fix here is to refactor privacy badger so that it doesn't add domains to the cookie exceptions list in order to block them. \n. This will be fixed by #425 as will the other bugs related to this. \n. Can you give me an example of a page where a youtube video is being blocked?\n. Weird,\nI am not able to reproduce this behavior... have you manually blocked youtube or google with privacy badger? When you click on the privacy badger icon, which domains are set to red? (this means they are blocked)\n. no news. needs to be worked on. there are other things that need to be worked on more. \n. @willsALMANJ we are indeed working towards getting the chrome version of privacy badger compatible with web extensions. That work is being tracked here: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/pull/845\nI have already, in that branch, fixed the issues with incognito, privacy, and unlimitedStorage.  The plan is to get this version out as soon as we find a strategy to migrate the data from the jpm extension to the web extension, this will hopefully be in the next couple of months. \n. @willsALMANJ is correct about the reason for the holdup on this. I am working on a data migration scheme now, I plan to have the web extensions version released as soon as thats done. Hopefully in the next 3-4 weeks. \n. The very next version of Privacy Badger will be e10s compatible as we are switching to web extensions. Yay! as far as @willsALMANJ yes you are correct. Those commits are the ones providing a smooth data migration path for users. Everything is set! Watch out for the next version, hopefully in mid december. . Indeed the current version of privacy badger is compatible with E10S. Thanks. . This seems like it would be a pretty common use case. I will figure out if there is a way we can do this. I would also happily accept a pull request.\n. @jdgalt that issue was a bug, it has now been fixed. \n. This will be possible as of the 1.0 release in the options page. \n. @pde do you have more details, or are you planning on doing this?\n. @pde did you ever folllow up on this or find more about it? Is it still a problem?\n. Interesting, I will have to look into this more. Can you give me an example page where this is happening?\n. This does not appear to have anything to do with the urls inheriting the protocol, but rather mediaworks.co.nz is being blocked because of the cookies that it sets. I will add mediaworks to the cookieblock list so that the css for these sites doesn't break. \n. next time you are on a verified by visa page, can you click the privacy badger icon, and tell  me which domains are blocked? (domains where the slider is red)\n. I think this is fixed by #343 \n. I have been unable to reproduce this issue. Can you tell me which domains privacy badger is blocking when you visit reddit.com? You can see the list of domains by clicking the privacy badger icon.\n. I have added redditstatic and redditmedia to the cookieblock list. That should solve your problem.\n. I was unable to reproduce this issue running mint linux. Are you sure that  privacy badger is causing this issue? Have you tried disablilng all addons and then enabling them one by one? Also be sure that all the packages on your system are up to date.\n. This is fixed by privacybadgerchrome@85b0abecbc99fd968020d81468cac8d6fb5f6eb5\n. for now you can trigger mastercook.com by trying to add a recipie, then you can click the privacy badger icon and move the slider for mastercook.com to green. I am unwilling to add them to the cookieblock list because they actually have a pretty bad privacy policy!\n. @pde can you review this so I can put out a release since everyone else is away?\n. can you give me the exact url of the website where this is happening?\n. Privacy badger probably decided to block your intranet.tld site because you include it on multiple first party domains and it sets a cookie, you can find more info here: https://www.eff.org/privacybadger#how_does_it_work\nWhen privacy badger blocks a domain it blocks it entirely, images, javascripts, everything. It blocks all requests to that domain.  But you can override privacy badger's settings. If you go to a site where your intranet is blocked, and click on the privacy badger icon you should see a list of domains it sees on that page along with sliders for each domain. If you drag the slider for your intranet domain from red to green it will be unblocked. Hope this helps!\n. Hi @oerdnj is this still an issue for you?\n. Hello @mundivagante, I can in fact confirm that this is privacy badger doing it's job and checking blocked sites for a dnt-policy.txt file to see if they are complying with do not track. So the cache entries are at least expected, and the cookies are probably due to that. However, I am going to mark this as an enhancement, because think that we should not be setting or sending cookies from that dnt-policy check.\n. New task: strip cookies from dnt-policy request.\n. I think mozAnon is the way to do it. The request shouldn't ever need\nclient certs or auth.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. Which version of privacy badger are you using?\n. duplicate of #298 \n. I do think it is worth adding a button to let the user clear all data, maybe we can also add a button that resets all trackers to privacy badger defaults.\n. Technically the unblock all trackers button does get rid of the user preferences, but it aslo gets rid of any heuristics that privacy badger has built up as well. Clicking this button would delete all settings, so it addresses the initial issue that OP brought up, but there is still no way to set all trackers back to privacy badger deafaults. I suppose that feature could be added, but I don't see the use case for it, can someone enlighten me?\n. @jimbo1qaz When you click the arrow next to the overridden setting it should go back to the privacy badger default, (which may be to block it). If you really want to unblock something the best way is to just drag the slider to green.\n. Actually it is potentially coming from privacy badger. We check each blocked site to see if they have put up a DNT policy file when privacy badger starts. If the url is scorecardsearch.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt then this is actualy the expected behavior.\n. The reason that privacy badger hits blocked domains is to check for the presence of the DNT policy file. I currently have it set to check when firefox starts up so that domains will be unblocked as quickly as possible if they actually do comply with DNT. This is our way of rewarding domains for acting responsibly. \nHowever, I can understand where this would be a cause for concern for some users. I don't think that this connection really sends that much intelligence to the blocked domain, other than the ip address and the fact that someone at that IP is running Privacy Badger, but again I can see where this could be a cause for concern for some users. One potential solution here is to have privacy badger check for the DNT policy on startup and then not check again for some random amount of time between 1 and 2 weeks. Another possible solution is to have all DNT checks go through a proxy that EFF runs which would get updated at regular intervals. It's not actually clear to me which option here is the more privacy preserving one. On one hand you are potentially letting advertisers know that someone at your IP is running privacy badger. On the other hand you are potentially letitng EFF know which trackers you block. What are your opinions on this? cc @pde \n. So for now, I have fixed this in ba17ee6835ccea56ebdd205cbe855c099d53d82e. Privacy Badger now only checks for dnt policy files at a random interval between one and two weeks instead of every time at startup. There is also an option to turn off DNT policy checking.  Additionally we are discussing building a proxy hosted at EFF which will notify the user about new DNT policies and revocations of DNT policies. We will have to wait until we have the resources to do this but I think that people having the option to opt out of the DNT  policy check is a good start for now.  As for your analogy it's not quite correct. If someone were to post the DNT policy and not actually stick to the agreement we think that it is pretty likely that we could sue them for unfair business practices.  It's not quite the same as just politely asking to not be tracked. It should have a bit more teeth than just DNT alone.\n. This is great! The only thing I would add to this is to strip the \"Cookie\" header in the request headers as well. If you add that I will merge this patch. Thanks!\n. Great work! Thanks!\n. I suspect that this issue is caused by #225. We are working on a fix there. \n. Interesting, is the image locally hosted as well or is it a third party image? Can you send me a screenshot of the page with privacy badger open so I can see what is being blocked?\n. It looks like you have overridden phplist.com to be specifically blocked (by dragging the slider to red). Try clicking the undo button next to the slider. I will also add phplist to the cookieblock list so that it doesn't get blocked entirely.\n. This already exists! You can click the badger icon in the privacy badger dropdown to disable tracking on the current site.\n. To disable on all pages you can go to the addons page in firefox and click the button next to privacy badger that says 'disable'\n. Can you send me a screenshot or tell me what domains privacy badger is blocking when you visit that page?\n. fixed in privacybadgerchrome@a912d9279cb8fa9344085c72ae6b1c725a444b47\n. This is a duplicate of #225 which we are working on. Please follow the activity there. \n. What a strange problem! I am unable to reproduce this in linux so far, but I will try it in windows.\n. This appears to happen when clients1.google.com is blocked. I have added the domain to the cookie block list. You can fix it now by moving the slider for that domain to yellow (cookie blocked) or green (allowed).\n. Which version of privacy badger are you using?\n. I'm going to assume that @cypherpunk's problem was due to checking for the dnt-policy file which has been fixed as of ba17ee6835ccea56ebdd205cbe855c099d53d82e As for @aliaalia that issue is already being discussed in #167 so I am going to close this issue for now.\n. This is fixed in the latest version of privacy badger, see #225.  What version of privacy badger are you using?\n. Interesting, I wonder if this is due to a conflict between privacy badger and one of the other plugins. I will have to investigate this further. It certainly doesn't happen without those other plugins, at least not in my testing so far.\n. So far I have been unable to reproduce this. Does the problem still happen even if you disable ghostery and the symantec toolbar?\n. Glad it is fixed for you now, thanks!\n. this is because of what is happening in #206 \nI need to refactor privacy badger to not use domain exceptions for its cookie blocking behavior. \n. Google should still be showing up even if you set the slider to green, do you see google domains loading on other sites still? For example, on youtube.com?\n. This is not a bad idea but unfortunately I don't have the time to work on this. However if someone else wants to do this you would have my full support. Marking as wontfix for now.\n. So far I have been able to confirm that this is happening in windows, immediately upon startup, whether or not e10s is enabled, firefox crashes if the latest privacy badger is installed. Interestingly privacy badger does not crash firefox on startup in linux, so that particular problem at least appears to be isolated to linux. However, privacy badger also appears to not work in nightly on linux. \nIt's not clear what is causing privacy badger to crash firefox in windows but the first thing I am going to try is making e10s compatibility fixes and getting pb working in linux on nightly, hopefully that will fix the windows problems as well, if not I will have to dig further.\n. I have fixed privacy badger so that nightly in ea936cfaebd004f65e4b05402301b8121609eb6c. It no longer crashes, the PB icon shows up and the plugin generally works. We still need to add e10s support but my assessment is that is more than a 1 day fix and so I am going to defer it for a little bit.\n. e10s support progress is being tracked here: #208\n. Please try again, are you still getting the connection failure? If so please tell me what browser and operating system you are using\n. This is a known issue with EFF's website, we are working on it. \n. @dcastellanos44 are you still having this issue? Can you tell me what operating system you have, what web browser you have and what other extensions you have installed on that browser?\n. These look great! Thanks @AshKyd \n. I am unable to reproduce this so far. Have you changed any other privacy related settings?\n. So obviously unblocking facebook would solve this problem, however it would also allow facebook to track you across the web.  The real solution to this is the UI being worked on in #165 \nOnce that feature ships you should be able to temporarily unblock facebook only for certain sites if you so choose.\n. Looks like privacy badger was blocking ebayimg.com, I added that to the cookie block list. For now sliding that domain to yellow or green in privacy badger's settings should fix the problem.\n. When you use pushbullet, and it gets blocked by privacy badger the pushbullet domain should show up in the dropdown when you click on privacy badger. If you slide that domain to green it should fix pushbullet. \n. Fixed in #250 , should work again in a couple of days. For now you can just unblock ebayimgs.com\n. Yea probably the exact same issue. I will try to do a release today or tomorrow so that this issue can get fixed.\n. So interestingly I am unable to reproduce this behavior, but I found a co-worker who is able to reproduce it. My fixes for nightly do not appear to fix the problem for him, so I don't believe they will fix the problem for you either. I need more information on this.  @indeyets @Mokura @bluecheckers can you tell me what OS you are on, what version of privacy badger you have and what version of firefox you have? \n. Also I want to make sure that you all have clicked 'customize' in the firefox settings menu and privacy badger doesn't show up anywhere in there? And that it is not hidden behind an arrow  like this \">>\" in the firefox toolbar. Can you all confirm those things?\n. via @bluecheckers\n\n\"After installing Privacy Badger 0.2.3 in Firefox 33.1.1, the Privacy Badger Firefox 0.1.4 entry appears in the Firefox Extensions list in the Firefox about:addons window. However, the Privacy Badger toolbar button fails to appear in the Firefox Toolbar, the Firefox Add-on Bar, or the Firefox/Customize/Additional Tools and Features window. A Privacy Badger menu with red, yellow, or green sliders appears nowhere in the browser to indicate whether Privacy Badger is functioning. I am not using Firefox Private Window browsing, and I have enabled Firefox / Preferences / Privacy / \"Remember browsing history\". The Privacy Badger toolbar button did appear in previous Firefox versions.\"\n. @indeyets Can you install a test build of privacy badger from https://cooperq.com/privacybadger-unstable.xpi  and tell me if it fixes the problem?  Also, when did privacy badger disappear? Was it when you upgraded your browser?\n. @Mokura does this fix the problem for you as well?\n. @Mokura @Bluecheckers @indeyets do any of you have firebug installed?\n.  I have released a new version of privacy badger that should fix this problem, please update your copy or install it again from https://eff.org/privacybadger \nThis version may still be affected by an interaction with firebug, so if it is  still not showing up try disabling firebug. If the icon still doesn't show up after disabling firebug, let me know and I will reopen the issue. \n. Try this fix and see if it helps: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/974165\n. @Bluecheckers please check out #253 I am closing this as a duplicate.\n. Interesting, when you are on salesforce can you tell me which domains are being blocked by privacy badger?\n. I will add content.force.com to the cookieblock list, this should at least fix the breakage while still minimizing the ability to perform any tracking that salesforce may be doing.\n. @kagoodwin13 noted and added.\n. I have implemented all of your suggestions (or at least left comments for the ones I didn't implement.) This is ready for another pass over. \n. Okay, I have responded to and/or fixed all of the things you pointed out. \n. Done\n. Wontfix, this addon is necessarily tracking. However you can fix it yourself by clicking the privacy badger icon on a page after you have tried to use the wishlist addon. You can then move the slider for amazon domains from red to yellow. \n. so, the icon itself is not what changes color. What changes color is the sliders for each tracker that you see when you click on the icon. Does that make sense?\n. This looks good other than the weird spacing issues. I still need to test it on nightly, but once the issues are fixed I am happy to merge. \n. After testing: It works great in firefox 36, however in firefox 34 I get the following error:\n\nMessage: TypeError: gBrowser.getTabForBrowser is not a function\n  Stack:\n    getTabForChannel@resource://gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm -> jar:file:///tmp/tmprfrxgx.mozrunner/extensions/jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi!/bootstrap.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-at-jetpack/privacybadgerfirefox/lib/utils.js:115:13\nupdateCountForChannel@resource://gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm -> jar:file:///tmp/tmprfrxgx.mozrunner/extensions/jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi!/bootstrap.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-at-jetpack/privacybadgerfirefox/lib/ui.js:159:12\nonModifyRequest@resource://gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm -> jar:file:///tmp/tmprfrxgx.mozrunner/extensions/jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi!/bootstrap.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-at-jetpack/privacybadgerfirefox/lib/main.js:38:3\nObserver<.observe@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/system/events.js:72:7\nloadURIWithFlags@chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml:148:15\ngDiscoverView_loadURL@chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.js:2115:5\ngDiscoverView_show@chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.js:2080:1\ngVC_loadViewInternal@chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.js:740:7\ngVC_loadInitialView@chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.js:701:5\ninitialize@chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.js:156:3\n.

Ah, it may have already existed, but thanks for addin gthe try/catch block. This looks fantastic :+1: Thanks for all your hard work. \n. hmm, this might acutally be the way to fix #206 et. al.\n. I closed it because it was related to the cookieblocking thing, so I was\nlooking into it. After looking into it I decided it didn't make sense,\nso I closed it. I probably should have left an explanation though.\nOn 07/10/2015 11:14 AM, Noah Swartz wrote:\n\nI don't know how I feel about the policy of closing 2.0 milestone issues\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/263#issuecomment-120483579.\n. Hi guys, sorry for your trouble! I have a patch on the way for this right now in #265. I will have a new release out by the end of the day.\n. Fixed version is now released.

Is this your review on AMO: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/reviews/656656/ \n\nThis is certainly a disturbing problem. Could you try downloading the latest version of privacy badger from eff.org/pb and see if you are still having this issue? Also can you disable any other addons so that we can be sure that this isn't caused by a conflict between privacy badger and another addon?\n. Great! I hope it doesn't crash again on you, please let me know immediately if it does so that I can try to diagnose and fix the issue ASAP.\n. I am unable to reproduce the issue. Perhaps it was a conflict with another extension. I am going to close this issue for now. \n. hi @kbquist,\nAs far as I can tell, your business model for priceblink is to retarget ads based on what the user is shopping for. Do I have that wrong?\n. hi @chrish42 can you tell me which domains privacy badger has blocked on the kickstarter page? I suspect the problem might be cloudfront but I want to be sure. \n. I have added s3 to the cookie block list.\n. This should be made easy by the move to web extensions. Won't fix in the legacy branch.\n. This is a common problem in firefox: try this and see if it fixes your problem: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/974165\n. cc @pde also for review\n. duplicate of #126 \n. I responded to the issue in the chrome repo. \n. Interesting, I will have to test this. \n. Confirmed, I have reproduced this. I will hunt down this bug ASAP.\n. @arcum thanks for the tip, I will re-open this issue and make an option \n. @arcum do you have a link to the relevant issue in bugzilla?\n. This is now an option as of 0.2.6 and the counter is off by default. \n. if you click on the privacy badger icon and unblock or cookieblock all of the facebook related domains does that fix the problem? You can unblock a domain by moving it's slider from red to yellow or green. \n. tell me which domains are blocked, when you try to view a video on facebook. \n. make sure that you don't have youtube.com blocked. \n. Can you tell me which domains privacy badger is blocking on github?\n. Click on the privacy badger icon and it will list domains it is blocking.\n. I am so far unable to reproduce this. It is also weird that this would be happening when privacy badger is not blocking any domains. Which version of privacy badger and which browser (and version) are you using? I assume the probelm goes away when you disable privacy bdager. \nCan you open up the developer console for your browser? Click the network tab and tell me about any domains where the request fails?\n. This works as expected. Perhaps I need to update the documentation. It is not the icon that changes color but the sliders for each domain that privacy badger detects. You can see these sliders when you click on the icon if privacy badger has detected third party resources on that page. \n. Indeed you can submit sites that aren't being displayed properly!\n. Thanks! Looks good!\n. LGTM, thanks for cleaning up the code!\n. Thanks I will add pipes.yahoo.com to the cookie block list. \n. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. It sounds like there may be a memory leak going on. I will take a look at the code and try to fix it. \n. I've been unable to reproduce this so far. Is it still a problem in the latest version of firefox?\n. Yep, sounds like a firefox bug then. Thanks!\n. do you have e10s turned on? If you click the customize button in the firefox menu do you see the privacy badger icon anywhere? Is it hidden behind the arrows that show up when you have too many addons?\n. @ianchanning @andreasio what version of privacy badger are you running? \n. @ianchanning there have been conflicts in the past with firebug. If you disable firebug and then disable and re-enable privacy badger does that fix the issue?\n. @Klaaninka ah there is your problem, you are running an extrememly old version of privacy badger. I haevn't been able to update AMO in a while so we are hosting the latest version of privacy badger at EFF. you can download it from https://eff.org/pb \n@ianchanning let me know if that fixes your problem as well please. \n. @Klaaninka do you have the Avast plugin installed? We have received reports that it can sometimes block the downloading of privacy badger. \n. Can you try disabling bitdefender and see if that fixes the problem?\n. Hi, so the reason I haven't published it is that 0.2.6 is not that different from 0.2.5, I mainly had to change the version to try to get it published in AMO. I will upload a new version when I make another release, is there a way that your script can look at the file at https://www.eff.org/files/privacybadger-latest.xpi for version changes instead of the head of the git repo?\n. My concern is that I might update the version without making a new release sometimes, and I don't want to break your script. \n. disconnect.me is not an addon that we maintain, you should file a bug with the folks at disconnect. \n. Have you changed any of the privacy settings in firefox from the defaults? What version of privacy badger and firefox are you using. Do you have any other extensions installed?  Can you tell me which websites this is happening on?\n. duplicate of #319 \n. The share me not code only blocks like buttons that actually come from facebook. It is possible that advanced cookie manager has rolled their own facebook like button. \n. When you click on the privacy badger icon what domains is privacy badger blocking? I suspect that it is blocking warehouse.salsalabs.com which may be needed for the page to work. Try dragging the slider for that to yellow or green and see if that fixes the problem. If so I will add it to the cookie block list. \n. fixed in privacybadgerchrome@090d4760828821114f768ff1396ac24e1db4b7dd\n. I suspect that this is a firefox bug. We shouldn't be able to do anything after the addon is disabled. I would report to mozilla.\n. Privacy badger only blocks things that set a cookie, I suspect that your other blocking addons are blocking trackers like facebook and last.fm before privacy badger gets a chance too learn to block them. \n. Just give it some time, it learns over time what to block and if it is not blocking anything that means that the things are being blocked by your other addons!  I think the issue here is that you have so many addons that everything is being blocked before privacy badger gets a chance to see anything, so no worries, you are safe!\n. Okay I am a little confused about your problem I think. Are you saying that the problem is that you have to unblock certain trackers in privacy badger to get last.fm to work? Or are you saying privacy badger is not ever blocking anything?\n. So privacy badger will never block first party cookies on a site. Facebook has to be able to set cookies on facebook.com to work. It will block facebook cookies on third party websites though. Can you send me a screenshot of privacy badger's settings on a website? Show me one where it is seeing but not blocking facebook?\n. I'm not comfortable adding this too the white list since I can't find a privacy policy anywhere on their site. But I think this is a great case for why we need to improve the heuristic. \n. I'm not really comfortable adding this to the list either, for the same reasons as the last one you submitted. I think this is a great exapmle of a good domain for users to override on their own if they so choose. \n. can you show me a site where guages is being used?  It is possible it never sets a third party cookie, in which case it would never be detected by privacy badger. \n. Unfortuantely privacy badger's heuristic doesn't recognize google analytics as a tracker because they don't use any third party cookies. Google analytics relies only on first party cookies. We are working on some improved heuristics though which may start blocking google analytics. \n. Exaclty, they don't use third party cookies so this works as expected. And yes, you can block them anyway by moving the slider to red. \n. @Osteri I think there are a few different ideas being conflated here, let me see if I can clear up some of the confusion. \nOn the web, when we talk about a third party what we mean is any resource requested from a different domain than the one that is in the URL bar. \nSo, for example nyt.com is loaded on newyorktimes.com it is a third party even though they are both controlled by the same entity. \nAnd yes, when google analytics is loaded, the javascript is loaded from a first party domain (google-analytics{dot}com). However, because of the way that the script is loaded, it runs in a first party context. Meaning that all of it's cookies and any other storage are keyed to the first party domain (e.g. example.com). What this means in practice is that your google analytics cookie on example.com is not the same as your google analytics cookie on github.com. Since the cookies are all owned by the first party, this is known as first party tracking, and since privacy badger only looks at third party cookies, it does not block google analytics. \nNow, if the script tries to do other things, such as canvas fingerprinting, privacy badger will identify that the script is doing such and block it. I suspect that this is why analytics is blocked in chrome but not firefox (some difference in how it treats different browsers). \nYou are of course always able to instruct privacy badger to block google analytics if you disagree with privacy badger's decision not to block it. \n. Thanks, I will add syndication.twitter.com to the cookie block list.\n. merging now but still needs review from @jsha \n. Unfortunately it is not currently possible the way that privacy badger is architected. I am also not interested in adding addthis to the cookie block list since they are a major tracker and they use browser fingerprinting.\n. @titanous @GRMrGecko can you build privacy badger from master and confirm that it now works on the latest nightly?\n. when alientube gets blocked you should be able to click the privacy badger icon and see that it is blocking an alientube.com domain, or something similar. Simply move that slider to yellow or green and it will be unblocked. \n. @rathann would you consider making a pull request with a commit replacing the sha1 library?\n. Can you give me a screenshot after you click on the privacy badger Icon so I can see the list of trackers? This definitely seems like a bug, but I can't reproduce it so far. Also what other addons are you running?\n. Okay I have looked into this pretty deeply. I suspect that the cause of this was settingsMap being initialized to the same tab object for all the different tabs, and not changing. This would cause the tabs to not update and therefore you would see trackers on duckduckgo. \nI have not been able to figure out what would cause this, nor have I been able to reproduce it. I have looked at the code paths surrounding this logic though and it looks pretty tight. My suspicion right now is that there was an uncaught exception in privacy badger or a bug in firefox that we were hitting, which has now been fixed. \n@Maxxxxxx are you still having this issue?\nI am going to close this for now unless it comes up again.\n. Agreed, please follow  up in #303 \n. Bummer, that may be a bug in the way firefox works. Either way I definitely plan to update AMO but it is not an easy process unfortunately. I am working on it though!\n. I removed the old version which was incompatible with the current version of firefox. The new version still has not been approved by the AMO moderators, so unfortunately it stiill will not be on AMO. You can still download it from https://eff.org/privacybadger though, which is the preferred method!\n. Ah well it is not directly linkable because it was rejected again. Uploading another new version now. \n. All my old versions are disabled by mozilla now so we just have to wait until this one is approved. Meanwhile it can be found here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/ but you still can't search for it until it gets reviewed.\n. This is probably because you do less browsing with one browser or the other, or one has had privacy badger installed longer than the other. \n. Are you running any other extensions? Particularly adblocking ones? Also what version of privacy badger and firefox?\n. @Snapy which preferences did you disable?\n@KommX what browser version, privacy badger version, and other extensions?\n. @BobAlice000 and anyone else still having this problem, can you try it with the latest version of privacy badger - 0.2.6? You can get it here: https://www.eff.org/privacybadger\nPlease let me know if that fixes the problem. \nAlso @BobAlice000 do you have E10S turned on or anything like that?\n. Glad to hear that it is fixed! I think it was simply a problem of having an out of date version. \n. duplicate of #277 \n. I've added appspot.com to the cookieblock list to fix this issue. As a workaround for now you can click the privacy badger icon and drag the appspot slier from red to yellow or green. \n. Please make sure that you have the latest version of the addon installed\nfrom https://eff.org/pb\nOn 03/03/2015 09:33 AM, ermingol wrote:\n\nscreenshot from 2015-03-03 18 32 46\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11158653/6468195/bdcb2dd2-c1d3-11e4-826b-7b672cf77b86.png\nI have a fresh profile in Firefox on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Firefox 36.0 and\n\"Mozilla Firefox for Ubuntu canonical - 1.0\") and get no Privacy Badger\nicon when installing the addon in Firefox.

Great, I am going to close this issue then. \n. Interesting I'm curious what would cause tadst to get blocked, since it seems unlikely that it would show up on multiple first party domains. \n. Downloading the latest version of privacy badger from https://www.eff.org/pb will solve this problem. AMO is not up to date, I need to get the latest version uploaded to the mozilla addons site. \n. I am unable to reproduce this issue. Please be sure you are using the latest version of privacy badger from https://www.eff.org/pb\nAlso please try disabling any other browser extensions to make sure they are not responsible. \n. I'm sorry you are having this problem. I am unable to reproduce it so far. I have noticed however that after I change a slider it doesn't reflect in the UI until the page fully reloads. Can you change a slider and then reload the page and see if this problem presists?\nAlso, can you please tell me specific examples of which domains you are unable to change the settings on and what the first party domain is as well?\n. You can click the privacy badger icon and move the slider for mailchimp from red to yellow or green. That will unblock mailchimp.\n. Seems like a duplicate of #319 \n. @arturdaz Thanks for the patch! I am a bit worried since it seems to be breaking the tests currently. Which is strange because it certainly doesn't look like it should be breaking anything. I am looking into it right now. \n. Merging this TBR since the tests are broken right now and this looks like a fairly small change.\n. From my observation blur makes requests to the following third parties:\nfonts.googleapis.com\nfonts.gstatic.com\nbootstrapcdn.com\ngoogle.com\namazonaws.com\n\nThe google.com requests definitely get all of your google.com cookies,\nwhich includes tracking cookies. The other requests do not appear to be\nsending any cookies, so all they will get is your IP address and the\nfact that you visited dnt.abine.com. I think that the engineer you\ntalked to is mistaken. Privacy Badger is working as expected, google is\nsetting tracking cookies when you visit dnt.abine.com.\n. My methodology was to look at the network requests when this page was loaded using the chrome developer console. \n. Privacy Badger does not currently support firefox for android. We should update the website to reflect this. Android support is being tracked in #271 \n. Fixed.\n. duplicate of #271 \n. It seems like this was happnening because wikidata was being blocked by privacy badger. I have added wikidata.org to the greylist. As a temporary workaround you can move the slider for wikidata.org from red to green in privacy badger. \n. idk whats up with travis, or why it ran twice, but this totally passes tests\n. Merging TBR\n. Clicking the privacy badger icon should re-enable blocking again for a given site. Also please make sure that you are running the latest version of privacy badger from https://eff.org/privacybadger\n. this is fixed by #346 \n. I will look into the errors but I think that:\n\nthree open windows and around 2700 to 2800 open tabs \n\nmight be the chief cause of slowness!\n. I wasn't able to reproduce any privacy-badger-related slowness when shutting down or restarting a browser with 100 tabs open. I was able to reproduce the behavior where clicking 'close all tabs to the right' is slower, but I am at a loss as to why privacy badger would slow this down. It's possibly related to book keeping on content scripts? We don't have any methods that run on the tab close event, so I think it is not anything we are explicitly doing. \nUsing 'close all tabs to the right' seems like enough of an edge case to me (especially when the user has a large number of tabs) that I think we can put this off until the next release. \n. Looks good, wrote a test to check the validity of SHA1 and it passes. Thanks for your patch!\n. This definitely sounds like a bug, *.eventbrite.com should never be blocked on eventbrite.com. Can you send me a screenshot of the page with the privacy badger menu open?\n. Okay I will add ebmedia.eventbrite.com to the cookie block list which should fix this problem. You can fix it right now by dragging the slider for ebmedia.eventbrite.com to yellow or green.\n. firefox doesn't use ABP as a base (just some utility libraries), chrome does but I would rather remove a third party dependency entirely than try to replace ABP with \u00b5block or anything else. \n. thanks for bringing this to our attention. I have added flattr to the cookieblock list. \n. @phanimahesh user whitelists should be permanent, and not on a per-domain basis! This sounds like a weird bug. The only thing that I can think of that would be causing this is if you are doing all of your browsing in private browsing mode, or if you have checked 'always use private browsing mode' in the firefox settings. This is because privacy badger forgets its settings when you finish a private browsing mode session, this is to make sure that your private browsing data stays private!\n. we will have to add buffer.com to the whitelisting popup to fix this. \n. Indeed dragging the sliders seems to be broken! However as a workaround for now, clicking in the black box behind the slider will move it to the desired place. \n. fixed in #364 \n. Looks good for merge other than my comments. Go ahead and merge when fixed. \n. looks good to me. \n. can you give me the exact domain that is being blocked? Or a screenshot of the privacy badger menu on the page that is being broken?\n. fixed in privacybadgerchrome@5d9f08998f2c951c99863105eb69a13b3e01f182\n. Thank you! Bug reports are valuable too! I can't fix things without dedicated users letting me know :)\n. Thanks for the suggestion! I definitely think you have some good points, and I certainly believe in the principals of open source and anti-capitalism. The problem with this is that all of our issue queue and contributors are already on github. Moving this project off of github would kill a lot of momentum and be a lot of work that I am not willing to take on. \n. try it now?\n. @SwartzCr do you feel okay about merging this now?\n. thanks, added to the cookie block list. \n. @fxmsk correct! Which slider did you end up moving to green to get the store to load?\n. thanks! I have added these both to the cookie block list, this will fix the problem for future privacy badger users. \n. this is fixed by #346 \n. @bilbo-the-hobbit can you send me a screenshot showing which domains privacy badger is blocking when you try to log in?\n. Sorry for the misunderstanding! I need a screenshot with the privacy badger menu open so that I can see what exactly is being blocked on your domain. Or you can tell me all the domians listed in the privacy badger menu and what their status is (red, yellow, or green). You can see the privacy badger menu by clicking on the privacy badger icon in the top right of your browser. Thanks.\n. Ah yes, this appears to happen if you have an account with readthedocs and then visit docs for multiple projects (on multiple domains). This probably wont ever happen for most people but I have added the site to the whitelist anyway. \n. LGTM\n. Looks good!\n. hmm, seems like we will have to add blogger to the one click whitelist. \n. added\n. We do plan to do this, thanks. \n. Thanks. We are working with the team at Mozilla to address some issues and concerns with the signing process. \n. It's all signed now!\n. fixed in privacybadgerchrome@9d59d4dc02d4e1c6b23b8bee7287b1ac06dcfaf3\n. WIP in 10fcf7040a48c9da1ff7167801800861267c464f\n. done! this works and has landed!\n.

I have fixed it in privacybadgerchrome@25a19c1a70004aa0cd3ed58e07fd5d4b6031fa6e\n. bump\n. some google tlds server a useful purpose and so we add them to the cookieblock list. We should add this one too. \n. this is weird, afaict piratebay.org doesn't set any cookies. I'm curious how you got a cookie attached to that domain. Can you find the cookie for piratebay.org and tell me what the value is? Also you, @amandabee\n. yes, I understand. But I am wondering what would cause it to block thepiratebay.org in the first place. Privacy Badger should only block a third party domain when it is setting cookies. Can you tell me if there are any cookies set for thepiratebay.org on the pirate bay website?\n. interesting, piratebay.org doesn't try to set a cookie for me, but it might be because you have logged in or something. Either way I will add piratebay.org to the cookie block list. \n. I guess we should add thepiratebay.org to the cookie block list, but I agree this does point at the larger need to do something about cloudflare.\n. Ah, so I did! Thanks for reminding me :smile: \nI guess this issue is covered by #472 then. \n. privacy badger downloads the list from eff.org \nI use the chrome one as the canonical cookie block list, but firefox and chrome use the same on from eff. \n. @ghostwords we are checking that privacy badger is enabled on the domain before we mark the third party as fingerprinting, but I think there is no good way for us to exclude the content script from certain domains, there is the exclude field but that only gets checked when page mod gets called which only happens when the addon is loaded. \n. Okay the last commit implements the recordFingerprinting() function from chrome.\n. supercookies can be tested at: https://cooperq.com/supercookie.html (rawgit)\nfingerprinting can be tested at: https://cooperq.com/canvas.html (beaverbird)\n. @SwartzCr this is ready for testing now, I have fixed the style nits.\n. Thanks, we will update the FAQ!\n. I had the same problem with the options link click handler. I can't\nremember how I solved it now, but I suspect its the exact same thing.

Duplicate of #206, we are working on it. \n. lgtm\n. lgtm\n. thanks @amandabee I will add yelpcdn.com to the cookieblock list. I agree that it would be nice to add some way for the user to see what has been blocked from a domain and why that domain has been blocked, but I'm not really sure where to put this in the UI. I feel like the popup already has about everything it can handle and is pretty crowded. Maybe in the options page?\n. Hmm, that seems like a reasonable place to put it, I think we should make that suggestion a seperate issue though. For now I have added both piratebay.org and yelpcdn.com to the cookieblock list. To fix it immediately you can drag the slider for priatebay.org and yelpcdn.com from red to yellow. \n. Seems like we need to unblock googlevideo.com\n. I have added googlevideo.com to the cookieblock list which should fix this problem. Thanks for using privacy badger! For now you can re-enable privacy badger and on the video edit page click the privacy badger icon and move the sliders for all googlevideo.com domains from red to yellow or green. \n. It seems like possibly we need to unblock mfcreative.com on ancestry.com and unblock findthebest.com on mooseroots.com\nIt would help me out immensely if you could click the privacy badger icon and tell me what domains are blocked (slider is set to red) for each of those two sites. Or send me a screenshot. \n. Current issues in this:\n- needs subdomains to be flagged as usercookieblocked\n- Needs to use port.emit to call the getParent function from utils so we can know if its in the group\n. This looks great for the most part. Only one bug that I have found: \nIf I set an individual subdomain to red and then the top level domain to yellow, I see that the individual subdomain gets put under the etld as cookie blocked, it should be blocked. Similarly if I have a top level domain that is set to green, any subdomains which I previously had set to yellow or red get put under the green top level domain. \nSo it seems like etld/green trumps subdomain red and yellow, etld yellow trumps subdomain red and etld red trumps no subdomain.\nI feel like the correct behavior here is that if a subdomain is already in a  user list it should not be grouped under it's top level domain. (An alternative argument could be made that it should always be grouped under it's parent domain, either way it should be consistent.)\n. Going to open a pull request so that we can more easily see the patches come in. Once the above bug is fixed I think we are good to go.\n. Turns out this isn't a problem for firefox. \n. It seems like there is some stuff in here about DNT as well, no? Also there are conflicts, can you please resolve them?\n. bump\n. Interesting, can you send me a list or screenshot of every domain that privacy badger has blocked on that page? This can be found by clicking the privacy badger icon on that page and seeing which domains the slider is red. (You can also try to fix it by moving any likely domains to green, one at a time, and then back. Which ever domain fixes the problem by moving to green is the one we need to not block)\n. Not a duplicate issue, thanks! I agree that we should block webRTC, though I would probably limit it more in scope to only blocking third party webRTC. First party webRTC can actually be quite useful for certain peer to peer services. We could also consider trying to show a popup if a first party wants to use webRTC, blocking until the user consents. But I would uncomfortable blocking first party webRTC by default. (Though it is of course a good idea if one is using tor, which is why TBB is always reccomended.)\n. I think that having privacy badger take actions to fix privacy problems in the browser is definitely on mission. I do get a bit jumpy about making those things happen by default, because it tends to make people upset when you block things they expect to have (see EFForg/privacybadgerchrome#141 and EFForg/privacybadgerchrome#253).\n\nI looked at the changes in ublock re: this and asked @gorhill about it here, and the setting that @elijh pointed at appears to maybe just block IP leakage from webRTC without disabling it entirely, which could be a desired feature, modulo the concerns pointed out by @gorhill. We could have this as an experimental feature which is turned off by default to begin with until we get more user feedback / testing on it. \nThe other option is to only block webRTC for third parties who are cookieblocked, this doesn't address the VPN leakage problem, but it does address the use of webRTC as a fingerprinting vector. \nProbably we should just do both of these things to give both the best default protection and the best options for further protection. \n. via @michael-oneill \n\nThe problem is that WebRTC can be used for invisible tracking, bypassing \nthird-party cookie blocks and blocking extensions. It is not only the local \nIP address that can be secretly ascertained and blabbed, although that is \nbad enough, but also a unique identifier that can single-out the user and \nused to report their web history. This can be done in numerous ways \nincluding, as is reported on the ublock list, establishing STUN servers with \nwildcard DNS entries.\nThere is also discussion on the W3C PING list \nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/2015AprJun/ about \nreporting unique deviceIDs in MediaDeviveInfo via drive-by (user is unaware \nit is happening) JS.\nIt would be good if we can get to a situation where WebRTC can still be used \nbut the user is in control of it, having the ability to authorise it case by \ncase. Tracker blockers can then help by enforcing good behaviour if the \nbrowsers do not.\n. I'm pretty much in agreement at this point, I think we certainly shouldn't block first party webRTC, that can be the job of another addon. However As @taravancil blocking 3rd party webRTC for cookieblocked sites is desirable. \n. Awesome! Thank you!\n. This is probably because privacy badger hasn't seen adxcore on multiple first party domains yet, so it's not sure whether it's a tracker or not. Once adxcore.com has been seen tracking on at least 3 first party domains, privacy badger will block it. \n. fixed. \n. General cleanup and polishing of the popup, it's pretty rough right now. Fix grammar errors, center it, make it look prettier / less scary, etc. \n. Um, now this also adds cool new icons. Yea. \n. Oh! Snap! This is actually the cause of #307, which I am finally able to reproduce now. So I've got that going for me, which is nice!\n. Can be tested by visiting the following four domains, after which act.eff.org should be added to the DNT list. \nhttps://act.eff.org (get teh cookie)\nhttps://standagainstspying.org/\nhttps://fight215.org/\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/j6a4phr4/\n. works as expected\n. fixed by your pull request! :+1: \n. That already works (or it should), but the sliders should be sliding as they do in chrome, I don't know what is causing this error, but I think it's CSS related. \n. I'm thinking it will. \n. because we have blocked it we assume it's a tracker. works as expected. \n. bump\n. lgtm\n. Yes this is fixed in 0.99 (and 1.0 which is out in a week!)\n0.99 was only up for a short time as a beta test for 1.0 so if your browser didn't already upgrade to it automatically, it won't until we release 1.0 \nBut you can download privacy badger 0.99 from here if you like:\nhttp://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.99.xpi\n. > refresh the page, watch as the badge number doesn't not increase monotonically\n\nYep, I can reproduce those bugs as well, but I have no idea what you mean by the above.\nI will let you know when I have fixed this. \n. Okay I have fixed all the bugs! This should work like a charm now, thanks Noah!\n. 1) I also can't repro this, I will look at getOriginalAction, but I also don't think this bug is likely to come up again after you have your eTLD changes landed. \n2) I am also not able to repro this, could it have to do with things getting blocked by abp? Here is a screenshot where I tried to follow your exact steps. .\n\n. I get a different bug where if outbrain.com is set to red all of its subdomains look to be cookie blocked, I think this is probably related to the bug that you discovered yesterday. \n. Okay yea that one I can reproduce, I will look into it a bit, but I wonder if it will go away with your ETLD fixes. Either way I think I should fix the logic that we were looking at yesterday and see if that fixes this problem. \n. Okay, I think I have fixed all of the above noted bugs now. Let me know if you find more. \n. I couldn't reproduce issue 2 but maybe this fixes it anyway? Issue 1 is fixed now for sure. \n. 1. yes they do if that top level domain is red. Isn't this problem going to go away with your ETLD changes anyway, since users cant change subdomains if they have changed the top level domain?\n2. weird, didn't even notice that, I will fix the test.\n. pushed a commit that fixes the test. \n. all fixed now, I think we should write up your battery of tests as unit tests though!\n. Okay, this fixes the latest bug (and even adds some tests for once!) Hopefully this is the last bug. \n. WOOHOO!!! :tada: :tada: :tada: \n. will be fixed by #425 \n. closed via #425 \n. :+1: Thanks!\n. ignore the test failures on this, it will be fine when it merges in with the cookie stuff. \nThis patch adds a guard clause to the tab worker for the content script that we inject to allow the user to whitelist domains. In some cases the tab that was injected onto goes away but the rest of the script doesn't know it yet and so tries to call a worker or tab that isn't there. This causes an error and can cause browsers to occasionally crash. This fixes that error. \n. This is kinda a duplicate of #10, there was a button to clear the cache but it was in a menu that I removed. I should add it back to the options page. \n. putting your comments in #10 so we don't duplicate.\n. So the problem with this is that there is no way (afaict) to say 'take up 100% of screen height', we can only do absolute pixel widths, so we have to go with the smallest screen we think someone might conceivably run this on. And I presume you mean the popup menu, yes?\n. Oh, or do you mean the list of sliders in the options page, which also doesn't take up the full screen height and can be fixed!\n. I agree, I think this is pretty bad UI right now and definitely needs to be fixed. I think this is pretty high importance, as well. \n. :+1: \n. Probably shouldn't come up again, I think triggering the thing once is fine, We don't want to force the user to read it if they don't want.\n. closed by @taravancil via #451 \n. via #389 \n\nThis looks great for the most part. Only one bug that I have found: \nIf I set an individual subdomain to red and then the top level domain to yellow, I see that the individual subdomain gets put under the etld as cookie blocked, it should be blocked. Similarly if I have a top level domain that is set to green, any subdomains which I previously had set to yellow or red get put under the green top level domain. \nSo it seems like etld/green trumps subdomain red and yellow, etld yellow trumps subdomain red and etld red trumps no subdomain.\nI feel like the correct behavior here is that if a subdomain is already in a user list it should not be grouped under it's top level domain. (An alternative argument could be made that it should always be grouped under it's parent domain, either way it should be consistent.)\n. I fixed all the other bugs you mentioned, as far as I can tell this is totally working except for that one bug. Once that is fixed I think we are good to go. \n. merging this with an open bug for the soft launch. \n. I think this issue is also fixed by #425 \n. @nekromoff if I understand you correctly you are talking about settings that the user manually overrides, yes? Such as manually moving a domain to Red, Yellow, or Green? I think there is a bit of a debate about what the expected behavior might be here.\nOn one hand the user might expect that any settings made by the user will stay the same whether or not they are in incognito mode, whereas another user might have your expectations that changes made in incognito mode will not persist. \nPerhaps an optimal solution to this would be to warn users browsing in incognito mode that changes made to the settings in incognito mode will persist. \n. Are you saying that you would also expect privacy badger to bring none of your settings from normal browsing mode into incognito mode when you start a new incognito session? i.e. privacy badger would start with a fresh database and have to figure out what to block all over again when you entered incognito mode?\n. okay so you are not saying that normal browser settings should not transfer over to incognito mode, you are saying that changes in incognito mode should not persist back to normal mode (which I agree with), is that correct?\n. I respectfully disagree, incognito mode essentially means 'never remember history and delete all cookies and identifiers when finished', you still get your bookmarks, saved passwords, settings, etc. \nI think that the proper behavior here is for privacy badger to continue doing as it does but for us to notify the user that setting changes made in incognito mode will persist into normal mode. \n. This is great, thanks!\n. Thanks for the comment on 1, 2 is a duplicate of #432  which we are working on!\n. I don't think there is a good way to do this in the UI, and I also feel like we should trust that the user is making the decision that they want and not try to second guess them. There are a lot of good reasons to move something to cookie blocked instead of 'blocked' or 'allowed'.\n. lgtm\n. version 0.2.6 is the latest version until 1.0 comes out later this week. We temporarily released 0.99 which is a prerelease of 1.0 but only to a random 5% of users to try to get some bug reports. \nYour copy of privacy badger will auto update later this week when we release 1.0\n. Great work! This is perfect, thanks!\n. Looks great!\n. This should be fixed by the newest version 1.0.1, please update your addons and try again. \n. Okay so I think there are like 5 different issues in one here. I will try to tease them out into seperate issues. For the cookie monster bug: I think we shouldn't actually be blocking resource:// urls ever. I will look into that. \n. The  channel.OriginalUri undefined issue seems to be a separate one.\nand the Operation is insecure issue seems to be yet another one. \n. Yea I have heard that from other users as well. I am going to look into what the breaking change might be here so that we can work with dom.storage turned off once again!\n. This should be fixed by the newest version 1.0.1, please update your addons and try again. \n. duplicate of #358 \n. we happily accept pull requests to fix such issues. \n. Fixed  by #509 \n. Hmm, I wonder if this is related to #486 , perhaps people have local storage turned off?\n. That's exactly it. We inject a script to check if a site is performing canvas fingerprinting, which is what will trigger this warning. \n. duplicate of #538 \n. oops sorry, I was reading to fast it is definitely not a duplicate of #538 but I still don't see how we can fix this, we need to access the canvas object to check for canvas fingerprinting. \n. This should be fixed by the newest version 1.0.1, please update your addons and try again. \n. Can confirm that this is happening\n. Yep, I haven't been able to fix this yet. Sorry. \n. PLEASE DON'T USE PRIVACY BADGER WITH TOR BROWSER. \nYou are compromising your anonymitiy by making changes to the tor browser, you are made more fingerprintable and (ironically) more trackable. You should not modify the default settings of Tor browser. \n. :) Sorry, I would love for it to be a thing in TBB but for now it's definitely not good for privacy. I'm glad you like it though!\n. I think this is a good candidate for a click to play widget actually, e.g. what we do with soundcloud and like buttons and stuff. \n. It is incredibly strange that nocookie.net would get blocked. Unless they are messing with localStorage or doing thngs that look like canvas fingerprinting. \n. unblocking nocookie.net should be fine. I think that this may have happened due to our overblocking bug. nocookie.net will not get blocked ever under normal circumstances. moving all nocookie.net domains to green should be fine. \n. Unfortunately I can't test this since 1p doesn't seem to work in linux. Can you tell me if any 1pass related domains show up in your options page?\n. Thanks! That is actually extremely helpful, I will look into this further so that we don't get similar bugs again. \n. If someone wants to work on this and submit a patch I would happily accept it. As it currently stands I don't feel like I can prioritize this issue to work on personally. \n. Exactly what @cuviper said. We do not support firefox on android, yet. \n. We probably can't do anything about this without a ton of work and refactoring, so not any time soon. I think the best we could do is have a warning for the user. \n. Actually it turns out this was the same issue as many other issues. I have fixed it as of 1.0.1\n. https://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.99.xpi\nor\nhttps://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.2.6.xpi\n\nI would actually appreciate if you would download 0.99 first and tell me if you stil lhave the same problems. So I can try to debug this issue. \nEDIT: Fixed the links\n. Which exact UI issue are you having?\n. Interesting, can you tell me if there are any errors in the privacy badger console for you? You can find them by click on the firefox menu and then developer->browser console and filtering messages for ones thatt say 'privacybadger'\n. interesting, I am going to take a look at the channel.originalURI error today. I also wonder if you have localstorage turned off in your browser (apparently this is a side effect of disabling all cookie access as well). I am working on both of those issues. \n. Your issues should be fixed as of 1.0.1 Can you please install the latest version and try again?\n. Weird, glad it is fixed though! See #465 for your problem with the filter list. \n. if you click on the settings button and move the slider for reading.am from red to yellow or green it should fix your issue. \n. Oh definitely it's good to let us know so that we can potentially add it to the cookie block list. I was just giving you a workaround in cause you hadn't already done so yourself, getting updates from the cookie block list can take a while. Thanks for the report!\n. What @cypherpunk said. See #358 for our discussion on this. \n. can you tell us any websites that might be including freedompublishersunion.com as a third party resource?\n. Privacy badger only ever blocks third party domains, so I need more details here. Can you tell me exactly what is happening to your users? \n. When I go to your website I get a message about it being down, not related to privacy badger. Is this happening for anyone else right now?\n. Interesting , your ip address doesn't get blocked for me, just the google fonts stuff. I think this probably happened because you have cookies from that IP due to being the administrator. It seems unlikely that it will show up as a tracker for your readers.\n. again, this is probably due to you getting cookies in firefox from being signed in as an administrator. I don't think this is likely to affect your readers unless you can provide specific examples. \n. @mpalmer I would be open to such a feature given that it meets 2 requirements:\n1. There must be a clean way to add this to the UI\n2. There must be a way to meaningfully inform the user so that they can make a reasonable choice. Assume this user knows nothing about how web tracking works. \n. Ah, this is because when privacy badger sees tracking on a domain it blocks the entire top level domain, including all subdomains. So for example avatars.discourse.org is not tracking but some other foo.discourse.org is tracking, privacy badger blocks *.discourse.org which blocks avatars.discourse.org even though it wasn't tracking. The reason for this is because if we just blocked the subdomain that was tracking a third party could use random subdomains and correlate the cookies on the back end. Does that make sense. \n. :) I'm sure that you don't! Unfortunately privacy badger doesn't keep a log of which domains specifically triggered tracking. One of the things that we look at is localstorage, is it possible that one of those domains is setting things in localstorage? \n. @mpalmer where is discourse actually broken? Can you show me an example? If it's never a third party then privacy badger shouldn't have any problem with it. Otherwise if privacy badger is breaking something on meta.discourse.org then, it's probably another domain that is the offender. \n. So looking at that report it looks like a bug in privacy badger for sure, but one which I think is now fixed. I just looked at it and cdn-business.discourse.org is properly marked as having DNT. I think whatever this issue was it should be fixed now. \n. Could I trouble you to re-open this issue on https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger ?\nThis repo is now deprecated and we are no longer following up with issues against this code base. . Thanks @bkrucarci, we will look into this and try to fix the issue for 32 bit browsers. \n. duplicate of #458 \n. Sorry, I think I was confused. Can you give me exact steps to reproduce the problem? And can you tell me if you have any non standard privacy or security settings in firefox? Can you also please tell me what version of the browser you have. \n. Are you still having this issue? I am unable to reproduce it. \n. We are aware. See #358 \n. I'm sorry, I don't understand what the issue is here. Can you explain in a bit more detail?\n. Privacy Badger isn't a popup blocker., firefox should actually be doing this job. But if it is not working you might consider installing another extension to do popup blocking. \n. Duplicate of #482 \n. The answer to this should be in the onboarding slideshow! You can get there by clicking the question mark in the privacy badger popup. \nTo undo a setting for a domain you can click the little circle arrow thing next to the slider. This will put the domain back under the control of privacy badger.\n. We used to have such a button, I guess I should add it again. \n. Please make sure you have version 1.0.1 installed from either addons.mozilla.org or eff.org/privacybadger\n. @not-so-gnubie can you please send me a screenshot of privacy badger's settings on google maps for you?\n. Which domain exactly is being blocked. Also the fact that it is moving back to red seems like an even more disturbing bug. \n. I think that this was due to the other issues we saw where privacy badger was overzealously blocking things. It should be fixed as of 1.0.3 - For now you can just manually unblock en.wikipedia.org of course. \n. Woot! Great job! Thank you :smiley_cat: \n. Great work, thank you!\n. Very nice, thank you! Fixes #460 \n. If you try restarting firefox and opening up that document again do the trackers go away?\n. :) okay not much, I was just going based on the fact that nytimes.com is definitely not loading fetishmovies.com.\nAnyway, if you restart firefox and open up that same document do you still see the list of trackers? \nCan you also tell me what version of firefox and what version of privacy badger you are running?\n. Do you by any chance have e10s turned on in firefox? See this issue for more info #208 \n. What version of firefox do you have?\n. Can you open up the browser console with ctrl+shift+j and tell me if there are any privacy badger related errors in there?\n. Looks great! Thanks!\n. See #358 \n. googleapis.com is already on the cookieblock list. So www.googleapis.com, as a subdomain, should also be cookie blocked. This is a bug. \n. Interesting, I wonder what is happening in these strange cases then. We might have a race condition that could be fixed, I suspect that writing tests and refactoring is the real solution to this problem. \nThat said, I think we should write a test case for this to make sure it doesn't ever happen. \n. I was able to reproduce this in #554, on http://kcundercover.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_Guide\nfonts.googleapis.com is being blocked. Definitely a bug. \n. hmm, now I am unable to repro this again\n. @nyuszika7h Is this still an ongoing problem for you? I am still unable to reproduce it and I would like to collect more details about your setup. Can you tell me what version of firefox and what OS you ahve? Can you also tell me the version of privacy badger you have and any other browser extensions you have installed?\n. I am also officially unable to reproduce this. Though I have now written a test case in a5d93044d5279cd17576526f09f01416f81840ca\nI wonder if this is a bug that existed previously in privacy badger that is not present in new installs. Maybe I can reproduce by installing an old version of privacy badger and then browsing around for a while and then upgrading. \n@anonsubmitter @nyuszika7h it would be helpful if you could tell me what version of privacy badger you originally installed, what version you currently have and all of the pertinent details about your firefox installation. And any other browser extensions you might have installed. \n. I tried installing an older version and upgrading to the new one but didn't have any luck with that approach. Waiting on more info from other bug reporters. \n. at long last I can reproduce this, AND #551 (and all of anon submitters site bugs).\nThe issue appears to happen when you have firefox set to not accept any cookies. \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Change cookie settings in firefox to never accept any cookies\n2. Start browsing\n3. ???\n4. Profit!\n. Having now researched the bug I suspect that it would. \n. Working on this issue in https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/tree/issue_516\n. Please do stop submitting until this is resolved! I think I will have a fix up in the next couple of days. \n. I think this should be fixed now with the last update. Closing for now. \n. Privacy badger already downloads a new list of acceptable dnt policy hashes from eff.org regularly. So this is already done! \n. Thanks for the help @vlag24 !\nClosing this issue in favor of #251 \n. Wait, they are saying that craiglist.org gets blocked on craigslist.fi I don't understand how that is a bug. Shouldn't that be the expected behavior since they are different domains?\n. I am not able to reproduce this issue, but it also feels a little like a firefox issue. Our extension shouldn't be able to effect the behavior of the menu icon. \n. see #10 \n. This is a duplicate of #10\n. I think we need to try to investigate why it got blocked in the first place. This is not the first time I've seen something similar happen. Could it be setting local storage data or doing canvas writes?\n. This is going to sound flippant, but have you tried restarting firefox? I am completely unable to reproduce this issue. \n. Please look through the issues before submitting a new one. \nThis is a duplicate of #358 \n. I would rather somehow link to a database that explains what each tracker is than link to the tracker itself. This is an interesting idea, but not one I currently have time to pursue. \n. I just really don't feel good about linking directly to those domains. Maybe we could link to a wikipedia entry or something\n. Can you merge your bouge branch into this one please? Right now there is a conflict.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Did anything happen before this? Did you change any settings or did firefox get updated or anything?\n. Wow, this seems really bad. @jawz101 have you recently changed any settings in firefox that may have caused this? Can you try to reproduce it? (I will also try to reproduce it.)\n. Where did you install 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 from? The versions on AMO and EFF have different extension ids (but the same code). This is due to a mozilla signing requirement. If you have 1.0.1 from eff.org it should automatically update to 1.0.2 no problem, if it doens't then I might have messed up the update scripts (but I'm pretty sure I checked and people were updating fine.)\nEither way I don't think this is the cause of the issue that is described in this bug, since it started 5 days  before I relased 1.0.2 \n. Yes in the future it will be in sync. The only difference between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 is the id (I had to increase the version to get the eff.org version signed by mozilla).\nI suspect that this whole problem is due to updates and id changes. I am going to close this bug for now and we can re-open it if people continue running into this problem. \n. This is excellent thank you! Is there any chance you would want to translate the chrome version as well?\n. yea, I'm getting around to it, adding the first run slideshow to translation is on my to do list. \n. Do you have third party cookie blocking turned on?\n. I'm pretty sure we would have to write some XUL hooks to make this work, and I am extremely reluctant to introduce any XUL into our codebase, I think it will make maintainance even more difficult than it currently is.  I think this is a super low priority.\n. I'm closing this. We definitely don't want to add any XUL to our codebase. \n. Interesting, I do not get the CSP warning at all. But it also seems like it would only very rarely be the case that a site does not allow itself to run javascript. I don't even know how we can check that programatically. \n. Yes but we inject javascript into the site to do things like cookie blocking and fingerprint and supercookie detection. So we have a good reason for it. \n. oh, interesting point, I think that the attack @Bernhard---H describes could actually prevent some types of heuristic detection and javascript cookie blocking. Right now I inject inline scripts into the page to do those things (which is what is causing the CSP warning). I wonder if there is a way we can prevent this from happening?\n. duplicate of #358 \n. this is already fixed. see #496 \n. this should be fixed now. this was actually the #486 local storage disabled bug. \n. I am beginning to suspect that this is also the cause of #516 \n. Okay I am fixing this bug in https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/tree/issue_516\nThe main bugs are fixed, but currently I am investigating an issue where if the user has cookies turned off privacy badger never blocks anything!\n. Current thinking for the above comment is that because we are blocking all cookies they aren't getting set by javascript either, should look into javascript cookies and how they affect heuristic reporting. \n. The version in addons.mozilla.org is the latest version. You can see the version of privacy badger by clicking on your firefox menu -> addons and then click the more link next to the privacy badger listing. \n. yep. had to bump up the version so amo would sign it, literally no difference between the two\n. Weird, this actually shouldn't be getting blocked since googleapis.com is on our cookieblock list. This may be more evidence for cookie block lists not working correctly in firefox. Can you send me the url where you see this?\n. Confirmed reproducible!!!\nI will write a test and figure out how to fix this. \n. Indeed.\n. Please do report all site bugs! We see them all, though we may choose to not fix some of them we like to know about them either way!\n. Ooh, I like this a lot! Now we just have to think about how that should look in the UI. \n. The text for these will soon be in the locales file, I would wait until then to try to change it. \n. also noted via email that I have more issues teaching PB, but the mains one of concern are NYPL (nypl.org) and LAPL (http://overdrive.colapublib.org)/\n. if you use the browser scrollbar does that bring the bottom of privacy badger into focus?\n. I think this could be fixed by setting the div height for the list of trackers to be a percentage height instead of a fixed height, then when it is scaled down in smaller browsers it should still display everything. \n. hmm I will have to look into it. To answer your other question there is no way to get developer tools to inspect extension panels unfortunately. It's a pain in my ass. \n. We can't move where the number is and someone already submitted a pull request to change the colors. \n. I don't think that this is the right way to link through to explanations about domains. These domains could be malicious and I don't want users accidentally visiting them because of EFF. I would be much more comfortable if there was a small icon that linked you to a page describing the domain (instead of linking directly to the domain). I will not merge this as is. \n. That said, thank you for your work! Do not be discouraged by this and please keep contributing! \n. A java update should not break privacy badger since privacy badger doesn't touch java in any way. Can you tell me what version of firefox and what version of privacy badger you have and also send me a screenshot of the broken popup?\n. Please do not stop reporting site bugs. The primary maintainers of privacy badger are me and @SwartzCr. We may not add everything you submit to the cookie block list but we definitely look at all of them. It is helpful! Do not be discouraged!\n. Do you see any errors in the browser console? Do you have e10s turned on? \n. Can you try uninstalling and reinstalling privacy badger to see if that fixes the issue?\n. ah, yes sorry this is definitely because of E10S. Privacy Badger does not yet support E10S (though it is in the roadmap). See #208 for more information.\n. Do you happen to have the avast AV plugin installed in firefox? That has been known to prevent the installation of privacy badger. Have you tried installing from addons.mozilla.org?\n. Closing this issue until I get a response. \n. This might be because of the fact that we changed privacy badger's plugin id to comply with AMO signing requirements. Let me know if it happens again with one of the domains that you have set since filing this bug. \n. this could be fixed by changing the class name, as that is what the replacement is keyed off of. That said the fact that it is being replaced even when privacy badger is disabled for the domain is worth opening a separate bug for. \n. I can definitely see how it would improve the feature to determine if the button is a tracking button or not, but for now, to keep the process speedy we have to key off the class name. I agree with the wisdom of such a change so I will re-open the issue, but I don't personally have time to work on it. \n. This should already work. I added disquscdn to the yellowlist as well. \n. Can you tell me what errors show up in the browser console?\n. @VeronicaGarcia Am I correct in assuming that palemoon will probably never implement firefox's upcoming web extensions api?\n. In that case I want to give you a heads up that once web extensions are stable we are planning to use that API for privacy badger in firefox. At that time we will stop supporting the jetpack version (this version) of privacy badger. Someone else will need to take it over if they want it to keep using privacy badger in Pale Moon. The reason for this is that by using WEAPI we would only have to support one code base instead of two, which cuts the amount of work needed to fix bugs and add features in half. \nI'm not sure what the current timeline is for WEAPI. \n. @wolfbeast  as of the next release we are switching to web extensions and this code base is officially unmaintained. I would definitely welcome a community fork to keep support for pale moon if that is something you are interested in doing! . Agreed privacy badger should not ever block localhost. \n. So adding it to storage.domainExceptionSites will disable it when localhost is the first party, which is maybe not what @brainpower is describing. I think the situation is that localhost was getting blocked as a third party domain, which probably shouldn't happen ever. I think the solution to this would be to check if the domain is localhost, and ignore it if so, in contentpolicy.js\n. Yea I think we should just check for localhost and 127.0.0.1 in isBlockableRequest\n. WIP please do not merge yet. \n. finished! Ready for @SwartzCr to review. \n. See #10  we used to have a clear storage button. I removed it but I guess it will need to be re-added. \n. closing this as a duplicate of #10 \n. Can you please upload a screenshot of the popup where the deactivate button is missing? This is not something that should ever happen and I am completely unable to reproduce it. Can you please also provide me with your browser version, os, and privacy badger version.\n. ah yep, thats it! The cookie settings warning is the problem here. We actually should research whether that cookie settings warning is still needed. Meanwhile you can get rid of the orange box at the top by clicking it and going through the slideshow which maybe will help a little bit. \nI think that the proper fix here is to make it more obvious that the above boxes can be closed or gotten rid of. Perhaps we should even put them on top of the main window.\n. You can unblock sites by clicking the privacy badger icon and moving the sliders from red to yellow or green. Or you can disable privacy badger entirely on a given site by clicking 'disable privacy badger for this site'\n. This is the same as #611, in my browser media-imdb.com does not appear to be tracking. I am beginning to think that these are not site bugs, but some deeper bug with your privacy badger setup. \n. I think that this is fixed by the last update. Closing for now. \n. I am ready to merge this pull request! I just need to make sure you agree to the new license (it has changed since you opened your pull request) https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/blob/master/LICENSE\n. Thank you! this is fantastic!  Would you be interested in localizing the chrome version as well?\n. I mean, facebook is almost certainly tracking you. I suspect that most of our users would rather not be tracked on facebook than view facebook comments. I am inclined to not add this domain to the yellow list and let users decide on their own if comments are important enough to let facebook track them. I am willing to hear counter arguments, but FWIW connect.facebook.com is already on easyprivacy. I would rather encourage facebook to respect DNT. \n. I mean, sure, blocking cookies might be enough to block facebook tracking, or it might not, facebook might be embedding 1x1px tracking images. Perhaps before facebook wasn't being blocked but I feel like not yellowlisting facebook is the right choice here. People can override that on a case by case basis if they so choose. \n. Sorry about that! The error message doesn't come from privacy badger so there is no way for us to indicate as such. Can you send me the url of the page that has vimeo blocked so I can take a look and try to fix this issue more generally please?\n. It was definitely blocked by privacy badger, you are correct about that! But the error message actually comes from vimeo not from privacy badger. \nI am going to close this issue for now since we can't reproduce it, please open a new issue if you find vimeo blocked again. \n. This seems like a reasonable request. I think a better way to architect it might be to implement our own logging subsystem so that logs can be off by default but enabled by a developer. It should also automatically prepend the string \"PRIVACY_BADGER\"\n. It is strange that these were ever blocked for you. When I test it these show up as not tracking. \nThis has also happened to me a couple of other times with things that you have submitted, I am beginning to wonder if you have a strange setup that is causing some false positives.  So lets learn more about your setup. \nWhat version of firefox are you running? What OS? What other extensions do you have installed? \nCan you create a brand new firefox profile and go visit once again the above mentioned sites with privacy badger installed? Do they still get marked as tracking for you?\nI'm also curious about how you are finding all of these broken sites, you seem to find a wide and diverse array of sites that are not working, which is great! I'm curious about your methodology, are you automating the crawling of sites to find broken ones, or do you just have very diverse browsing habits?\n. creating a fresh profile with firefox portable is fine. There is no need to delete your current profile. You can run firefox with the profile manager like so: firefox -ProfileManager\n. hi @anonsubmitter I am going to close all of your old site bugs since I think they are fixed by the new version of privacy badger. Please re-open or comment on any that are still not fixed by a fresh install of privacy badger. \n. where did you download it from?\n. Oops sorry I didn't read the bug report close enough! Currently privacy badger is not compatible with firefox for android. See  #271  for more info. \n. Actually the tests were failing not due to your pull request but due to mistake on our end. Please reopen your pull request nad I will re run the tests. \n. cc @SwartzCr \n. I am ready to merge this pull request! I just need to make sure you agree to the new license (it has changed since you opened your pull request) https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/blob/master/LICENSE\n. Thanks! We are aware of the issue and have already fixed it. It will be updated in the next release!\n. This is very strange indeed! Can you please send me a screenshot of your firefox window? Can you also click the menu -> developer -> browser console and tell me if there are any privacy badger related errors in there?\n. @FixitMad I think that your bug is actualy the same one as #644 and the bug the rest of the people are experiencing here is a different one. \n. I am completely unable to reproduce this, but if someone can reproduce it and fix it that would be great.\n. I also wonder if OP meant to put this in chrome instead of firefox. \n. @cypherpunk did you download pb from addons.mozilla.org or from EFF?\n. I am unable to reproduce this so far. Can you tell me what your screen resolution and operating system are?\n. I don't happen to have the time to work on this particular issue, hopefully someone else will want to take it on. \n. Sorry the README is out of date! I will fix it right now. \n. what @daleeidd said is correct. \n. Thank you for your contribution! I think that maybe a better solution though is to make the text smaller, and do it in the css file instead of the html file. If you can make those changes I would be happy to merge your pull request. \n. Just the following domains... please!\n. Very nice! Thanks!\n. Thanks! We will look into this. For now you can click on the options link in the popup (the little gear icon) and move the slider for scene7.com from red (blocked) to yellow (block cookies) or green (allow)\n. Ah sorry! This will be fixed as of 1.0.3, the options page should work again. \n. This still completely duplicates the behavior of the \"block all third party cookies\". I don't understand how this would offer any advantage over functionality which is already built into the browser. \n. We put things on the yellow list because if they are not there many websites break. Like @jawz101 said, the yellowlist is their to prevent things from tracking you without breaking websites. Allowing users to disable the yellowlist entirely would be giving them a gun to shoot themselves in the foot with. I'm worried that this option would be confusing and frustrating for many users. \n. Actually the list gets updated when your browser starts and then again every 24 hours from eff.org \nI am against the \"disable auto update list\" for the same reasons as I am against the \"block all\" button. I don't want to give people ways to shoot themselves in the foot.\n. We do not currently add any cosmetic filters, if we do in the future I would definitely make it optional behavior. \n. you can actually just copy the entire \\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\w59orosd.Privacy Badger\\jetpack\\jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack\\ directory.\nTo clear storage you could do that, but I should really just add a clear storage button. See #10 \nI think we should actually come up with an easier way to export and import you rsettings. \n. @andru you can find your settings in %CHROME CONFIG DIRECTORY%/Default/Local Extension Settings/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp\nThe next version of privacy badger which is being released on the 13th of december will have the ability to import and export settings. . How to test:\nBefore: Run clean firefox with cookies disabled. See that  nothing gets marked as tracking. \nAfter: Run clean firefox with cookies disabled. See that privacy badger still detects trackers as expected. \n. as to your first point I was able to reproduce it but it also exists on master, so I think it should be marked as a seperate issue. \nfor the second point, yea I could probably write a test for this but I would rather do that after I get a bugfix release out, since I don't think it's going to be particularly easy to test. \n. Thanks, but we actually use the chrome cookie block list as the canonical one (maybe I should delete this one) that gets uploaded to the EFF servers. I would accept a pull request that sorted that list hwoever!\n. This feature is in chrome. Just needs to be ported to firefox by someone. \n. The list push resolved this issue for firefox uesrs. Fix will be out in the next release. \n. we are able to block things in prefetch and we do. \n. That message happens before it gets blocked, so it is not neccessarily indicative of youtube getting blocked. \nThe infinity bits is a little concerning though (obviously a math error). \n. Thanks for fixing this problem @gunesacar! :+1: \n. I suspect that this is due to a bug whre privacy badger was overzealously blocking things, which is fixed as of 1.0.3\nYou can fix it now by moving all googleapis.com domains to 'cookieblocked' \n. Thanks! This is great. Would you be interested in adding a spanish translation to the chrome version as well? https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome\n. es is correct, glad you like privacy badger! Thanks so much for the translation!\n. I think that @cynthiatekwe meant to make this pull request against privacy badger chrome instead of firefox. Closing. \n. If you unblock the domain bcbits.com it fixes this problem. I suspect that this got blocked due to a bug in privacy badger which should now be fixed. \n. I'm going to call this a duplicate of #632 but I do take it as another request, and I will make it a priority!\n. This is fixed as of 1.0.3 which should be out in the next couple of days. \n. Just to confirm, this is happening when you first open the settings page correct? \nI made the process when you change one setting more efficient in 1.0.3 but the initial load is still a beast, I guess I have more work to do making that inital load less of a memory hog. \n. Closed via #742 \n. @zipnemud can you check if you have multiprocess firefox (E10S) enabled?\n. Okay, I will look into this, thanks!\n. with 1.0.3 are there any errors that show up in the browser console?\n. I just tested 1.0.3 in nightly with Multiprocess turned off and it worked like a charm. Are you still having this issue? @zipnemud \n. mlissner, can you please tell me which version numbers you have and also tell me if disabling multiprocess firefox fixes the problem?\n. what version of nightly do you have?\n. please update to the latest version of nightly. I just double checked on my computer and everything seems to be working fine. \n. Closing this issue for now, I suspect that the problem is with an old version of nightly and not with privacy badger. \n. Glad to hear it! Thanks for submitting a bug report! \n. Can you please open the developer console by clicking the Firefox menu and then \"Developer\"->\"Browser console\" and search for privacybadger and tell me if there are any errors that occour when you try to open the icon?\n. We probably wont add that because it would require messing around with XUL which is about to be disabled for extension developers. Please try changing the setting and let me know if that fixes it. \n. Great work, thank you! :+1: \n. privacy badger should not ever be deleting existing cookies, by which I mean we do not have any code that deletes existing cookies. This will take some research. \n. This is definitely not a thing that should ever happen. subdomains of github.com shouldn't even show up in privacy badger on github.com \n@pde lets try to reproduce this bug together. \n. fwiw I am unable to reproduce this in firefox \n. dang! @rugk can you also confirm that you have the latest version of privacy badger (1.0.3) and please tell me what other privacy related settings you have turned on (cookies, no history, etc.)  thank you!\n. looks like this is the same bug as #118 this is a top priority for me. \n. oh interesting, I wonder if SDC is the problem here. @rugk do you also have self destructing cookies extension?  Can you both list the extensions you have installed? (and you @pde if you manage to reproduce this). \n. @rugk are you still seeing github.com blocked by privacy badger anywhere? Can you point me to an exact url?\n. okay so github.com is no longer blocked for @rugk how about you @jawz101 are you still having this issue?\n. okay, I'm going to close this for now since no one can reproduce it any more. I will re-open if we can get a reproduction. \n. @foxidrive can you open another issue and show me some screenshots of the problem, and tell me exactly which domains are being blocked on stack overflow?\n. Bug #118 is still open so please follow progress and post your info there. \n. You should be able to whitelist the individual domains needed for oauth to work in the privacy badger settings page at any time. \nDo you have a suggestion about what we should do to allow oauth logins that have a redirect?\n. have you tried unblocking 1password domains? Click the privacy badger icon and click the settings button, then move any domains related to 1password to green (instead of red). \n. I am not able to reproduce this at all, but I would accept a patch if someone can come up with a fix. \n. duplicate of #643 \n. I believe that this is an issue with Firefox sync and is outside of our control. Sorry!\n. duplicate of #643 reopening that one and closing this one in favor of it. \n. this issue should be fixed now, I believe we mistakenly uploaded a broken copy of privacy badger, please confirm.\n. Please try clicking the check for updates button in the firefox addons page and see if that fixes this issue?\n. okay please try one other thing, I think that you may have gotten a broken release we accidentally uploaded. Please remove privacy badger and install it again from https://eff.org/privacybadger\nThis should fix the issue. \n. Great! @Learn-Digital-Audio this should fix the issue for you as well. \nAs for the icon being gone that will be fixed in the next release. \n. Either one is fine, they will both normally have the same version, the reason we self host as well as use AMO is that self hosting allows us to sign the package with our own key, that way we can vouch for the integrity of the package. The other downside to AMO hosting is that mozilla occasionally takes an unreasonably long time to approve of a package. The reason we use AMO anyway is because some people only find packages via AMO. \n. this issue should be fixed now, I believe we mistakenly uploaded a broken copy of privacy badger, please confirm. \n. if this is not fixed please uninstall and reinstall privacy badger to fix the issue. \n. I don't think that we control the order that languages are read in, I suspect that this is a bug in firefox and not in privacy badger. \n. A fair point, this is at least worth investigating. \n. this should be fixed by the move to web extensions. \n. I would happily accept a patch to fix this, but I don't personally have time to work on it. I am currently moving full speed ahead on the transition to the web extensions API. \n. Thank you, we hope to fix this in the next release. \n. Can you give more details please? In what way does it not work? Are there any errors present in the development console? Do you have multiprocess firefox enabled? If you download a precompiled version of nightly does it display the same issues?\n. do other addons work in your compiled version, just not privacy badger?\nto disable multiprocess firefox click on the Firefox menu -> preferences and then uncheck the box that says \"Enable Multiprocess firefox nightly\"\n. Yea, it's hard to say why the compiled version isn't working, but I suspect that it is an issue with the compilation process and not with privacy badger. If you could test some other addons with your compiled version of firefox and see if those work it might be helpful, but I don't think I am going to be able to debug this one. Sorry. \n. how about https everywhere, it's another addon from EFF. \n. Sounds like it's some problem with the distro or libraries then and not with privacy badger. I'm sorry but I'm afraid this is out of my hands at this point. Good luck!\n. What is your screen resolution? And can you post a screenshot of the issue?\n. duplicate of #10 \nsee there for more thoughts on this. \n. Please explain what you mean when you say it does not allow privacy badger. \n. seems reasonable to me\n. I would want to think through more the idea of making the image click sensetive. It seems like there are a number of ways things could go wrong with that. I think that for starters having an option in the settings page that makes things cookieblocked by default would be a good way to go. The effect of this would be that if a tracker would be 'noaction (green)' it would be marked as 'cookieblock' instead. \n. as to the second suggestion, I never want privacy badger to change a users manual settings. I think that would just lead to confusion and frustration. \nI am also against cookieblocking everything by default, I think that should be behavior a user turns on. The reason is that many things are not actually tracking you and shouldn't be punished if they are not. Also I suspect that this feature will break things and I do not want to do that for most users. \n. woohoo! This is great work, thank you!\n. Wow sorry I didn't see this somehow but it looks great! Thanks for the contribution!\n. most urls are a bit shorter than this, and the status screen is already about as wide as I am willing to make it. Sorry for the inconvenience though! \n. awesome! Thank you for translating! :+1: \n. Strange! can you open the browser console ( ctrl-shift-j) and tell me if there are any privacy badger related errors? \n. Interesting, I am not able to reproduce this issue. Can you try uninstalling and reinstalling privacy badger?\n. It should be fine to run privacy badger with ad muncher. can you send a screenshot of the strange behavior you are seeing?\n. It looks like ad muncher is (ironically) injecting third party content (in this case from admuncher.com) into the sites you visit for it's normal operation. Privacy Badger is working like it is supposed to and blocking any third party (in this case intercept.(something).admuncher.com) that appears like it could be tracking you. It is not clear why admuncher is doing this and it could be perfectly benign, or it might not be. \n. Thanks, good find! I have a patch up now to fix the issue. :+1: \n. Seems reasonable. Localhost should also be whitelisted. \n. agreed\n. Merging TBR\n. already fixed, will be in the next release. \n. already fixed. Will be in the next release. \n. correct, it is not injecting the facebook button but replacing the one that is already there with one that wont track you. This behavior can be disabled if you don't like it. \n. Changelog can be viewed here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/versions/ \nI am unable to find the Show Release Notes feature you are talking about. \n. Can you please provide more details? What exactly is not working - Are the other extensions breaking in the same way? What are your settings, etc. etc. Please provide as much details as possible. \n. So I would say that there are two extra advanatges that privacy badger could give you here;\n1. Social media widget replacement - not sure if ublock does this or not, (or maybe your social media widgets are already entirely blocked by ublock) but if they are not privacy badger can add an extra layer of protection. \n2. Cookie blocking - we block cookies and referers from many things that would otherwise not normally be blocked i.e. google maps ; this can add an extra layer of privacy to your browsing. \nIf you think that either one of these is good then I would say use them together, otherwise don't worry about it. \n. So the one nice thing about the tooltip is that it allows users to see the whole domain name in cases where it gets cut off.  This is something that people seem to really like, so I wouldn't be comfortable with removing the tooltip until we have a way for people to see the whole domain. \n. I'm having a hard time visualizing what you are suggesting here. I'm reluctant to make the font smaller though because I think it would be too hard to read at that point. \n. I'm pretty sure that privacy badger is incompatible with sandboxes since we determine what is a tracker by observing behavior over time instead of using a blacklist.  For sandbox use you probably will want to try one of the blacklist based tracker blockers such as disconnect or ublock. \n. I would happily accept a patch for this but it is not something that I have time to work on, sorry. \n. having such a setting would be fine (though you should note that soon this codebase will be deprecated and we will be using the web extensions API). \n. Sorry, I haven't had time to merge pull requests for a while. It is now merged. Thanks for the commit!\n. Thanks for letting us know, I will look into this. \n. Wow, this is excellent work! It's even commented and tested! Thank you for the patch. :+1: \nThe only thing that I would note is that the IP space for localhost is actually 127.0.0.0/8, which we might wish to account for. But I think that can be done separately. \n. Is there any chance you would be interested in porting this code over to the chrome version as well?\n. Thanks for letting us know about this! I definitely want to ensure that privacy badger is accessible for everyone. Is there any chance you would be interested in submitting a patch to fix this? It would be extremely helpful, and you would be a hero!\n. Fixed in #707, thanks @C0rby !\n. great catch, thank you very much!\n. lgtm, thanks!\n. unblocking firstlook.org fixes this issue. I have added it to cookie block list. \n. You can test by moving firstlook.org to green or yellow. Otherwise it should happen automatically in a few days. (but for now just move it yourself.)\n. We have been using transifex but I would definitely prefer to use something that is more in line with EFF's stance on privacy. I have no objection to this, but also no time to work on it ATM. \n. If you want to create that I could review it. Just make a pull request. \n. this sounds like another argument for script surrogates as in efforg/privacybadgerchrome#400\n. Awesome thanks! :+1: \n. I agree that this would be an excellent feature for us to support. I think that the proper way to do this is to keep relying on a local nonsycned data store but allow the user to check a setting in privacy badger which will then copy the data to the firefox synced data store. I don't think we should do any of this work though until #208 is fixed. \n. Great work! Thank you so much! :+1: \n. Thanks!\n. I think that perhaps @franzwr is right. Perhaps one of your other addons is using google analytics? Try disabling them one at a time and see if you can find the culprit. \n. Well AMO definitely loads google analytics. So that could be the cause, but it is definitely odd. You don't happen to have multiprocess firefox turned on do you?\n. okay so just so I am clear, if you close the browser completely and then open a new firefox window and go to about:addons privacy badger still shows google analytics? But not on any other about: pages?\nCan you try disabling your other addons one at a time to see if one of them is the culprit?\n. I am still unable to reproduce this issue still even with a fresh profile. Are you able to reproduce it with a fresh profile?\n. So I can confirm this finally. And yes, it does indeed look like google analytics gets loaded on the about:addons page due to content from addons.mozilla.org being loaded on that page. \nPrivacy Badger is blocking google analytics as expected! So really, Mozilla is the one we should be complaining to here, why the hell are they loading google analytics\u203d\n. I agree that replacing it with a static button e.g. what we do with social widgets is a good way to go. \n. fore more info see efforg/privacybadgerchrome#400\n. This should be easy to use by including an anchor in the url for which tab you are on. E.g. resource://jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-eff-at-jetpack/data/options.html#whitelisted-domains\n. Closed via #742 \n. Agreed! This would be a great feature to have. \n. Have you checked that those domains are actually being loaded in your network tab? It is possible that lightbeam sees that there would be a request to them and ads them even though they get blocked perhaps. \n. hmmm, very interesting. I will have to set up a debian machine to debug this issue. My first guess is that it is a bug in iceweasel or some weirdness with 32 bit machines. You could run the firefox dev tools profiler on a tab and see if anything related to the extension shows up. I wonder if there is a way we could run a profiler directly on privacy badger...\n. This should be fixed by the move to web extensions. Won't fix in the legacy branch, but do try updating to the latest version! 1.8.1 as of today. \n. fixed by @mlopezfm !\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome! Thank you so much!\n. Excellent work. Thank you very much!\n. Awesome, thank you very much! \n. Thanks! :+1: \n. If I recall this might have been necessary due to the timing of how privacy badger detects local storage tracking. @gunesacar may be able to offer more insight. Is it possible to modify the tests to account for this?\n. @Anonymity-Rocks wait! Before you do that. I have been trying to track down this bug for a while. And you could help me immensely! Can you first off tell me what version of Firefox you upgarded from? Can you also tell me what version of privacy badger you are running? And if possible could you send me the copy of privacy badger from your firefox profile directory? It would be a huge help! Let me know if you have any questions about where to find these things. \n. It looks like we are still replacing social widgets even when privacy badger is disabled for a site. Of course, this should not happen. \n. Thanks!\n. Yep, thats a bug alright. Do you see any errors in the privacy badger console or browser console?\nI am unable to reproduce this bug with the same version of privacy badger and ff\n. There is a PB console indeed! If you enable addon debugging you can click the debug button for privacy badger in about:addons and get a console. The same debugging messages should show up in the browser console though. \nSo, I am curious if this bug is related to issue #711 - are you able to reproduce this in a clean firefox profile with a new install of privacy badger?\nLet me know when you have addon debugging set up, and I will ask for some more information. \n. I am also unable to reproduce this issue still even with a fresh profile with just canvas blocker and privacy badger. Are you able to reproduce it with a fresh profile?\n. Can you please give me exact steps to reproduce this on a fresh profile?\n. Thank you!  I can finally reproduce this, and it looks like it is fixed in the current master of privacy badger. So you should see the fix when the next release comes out. \n. This is fixed by a patch someone submitted earlier. The next release should work as expected (I will get it out tomorrow or monday)\n. Fixed version is out now. \n. This looks excellent! I wonder if waiting until the search was 2 characters to start filtering would solve the key delay problem? Excellent work though, I am happy to merge this now! \n. Nice! This is excellent work, thank you very much! :+1: \n. Can you duplicate this behvaior if ghostery and ublock are completely turned off? Can you send me a screenshot, if so?\n. Hmm, this is very strange. If you open the privacy badger options page are there any domains listed there?\n. Well you can of course open privacy badger and see which domains are set to red, those will be the ones that are blocked by privacy badger. You can also open firefox's network tab by pressing F12 and then clicking 'Network\". You can then verify that there are no network connections to the blocked domains. \n. Awesome! Thank you so much! \n. Seems like a good idea to me! \n. I have added this to the cookie block list. \n. I support this. \n. Hi, we have now switched to https://github.com/eff.org/privacybadger as the codebase for both firefox and chrome as of the next version of privacy badger. This feature will be available in the next version of privacy badger. . Thank you! I think this is an excellent change! \n. can you tell me which domains are being blocked by privacy badger on gmail?\n. if you disable privacy badger on gmail.com does it fix the issue?\n. @GAJansen @vin100vin does moving accounts.google.com to green fix the issue for you?\n. Thanks!\n. This change looks good. There is still an annoying behavior where we refresh the page when someone changes the setting for a domain, which causes the search result to be reset, but I think that can be fixed separately. \n. looks great! Thanks!\n. Nice! I think this will be much better, thanks!\n. spinda.net will only get blocked if the user visits three sites that include resources from it.  It seems like most people are unlikely to visit three different sites that include content from spinda.com so I don't think that this is something you should need to worry about. \n. So privacy badger should usually start blocking things after the third time it sees them, if they look like they are tracking you. \nHOWEVER if you are doing something like always running in private browsing mode, privacy badger will forget its heuristics each time you restart the browser. Or if you are blocking third party cookies and javascripts by default, privacy badger wont see many things as tracking. Is it possible that you are doing one of these things?\n. This is definitely a bug, which should be looked into further! I haven't been able to reproduce it so far, but I will keep trying. \n. Thanks! This is excellent!\n. :+1: Glad you were able to resolve this. I am indeed very concerned about what do about cloudflare's cookies. \n. Please send me a screenshot of the privacy badger popup in gmail.com\n. I am still completely unable to repro this. I have every domain yellowlisted and gmail works just fine for me. \n. Closing this for now. Please re-open if it happens again. \n. Please tell me what version of firefox and what version of privacy badger you ahve. Also have you changed any settings in firefox recently?  Also please tell me which domain specifically had the problem so I can verify this. \n. Thank you!\n. Thank you! \n. This is great, thank you!\n. if you open the options page by clicking on the gear icon you might be able to whitelist google domains from there... does that fix the problem?\n. Ah, someone else just submitted a russian translation as well, can you look at it and see if there are any changes that should be merged in from this one?\n. I thought that transifex cost money, is that not the case? Either way - I will soon be merging the two privacy badgers into a single code base. Once that is complete, I am happy to figure out how to use transifex and get privacy badger on there if that makes it easier for people to translate!\n. Hmm, I am not able to reproduce this problem.  If you open up menu -> developer -> browser console do you see any messages from privacy badger? Have you changed any of the default firefox settings? Does privacy badger work in a fresh firefox profile? Do you have any other extensions installed?\n. This should be fixed by the move to web extensions, we will only check the domain once per week. Won't fix in the legacy branch, but I will accept pull requests! \n. Thank you !\n. I suspect that this is because of electrolysis. Working on this in https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/pull/845\n. it seems like moving analytics.google.com to cookieblock fixes the issue on this site. This is probably another vote for script surrogates. \n. I am absolutely not going to unblock scorecard research. But for now you can work around it by disabling privayc badger on the effected sites or moving the trackers to cookieblocked status. \n. Thanks!!\n. No, this would break waaay to many things, and I won't give users a gun to shoot their own feet with. \n. We block more stuff than ghostery does, also we use a heuristic not a black list so we have to determine dynamically what is a tracker. When we decide something is a tracker we already do block it by default. The closest analog here would be to block all third party resources by default which would break way too many things. \n. Privacy Badger is not currently compatible with firefox for android. See #271 \n. This will only happen for people who have a cookie from sudleyplace.com and see it as a third party domain on three or more first parties which causes privacy badger to think it's a tracker. I'm sorry that this happened for you but I think it's unlikely to happen to anyone else visiting your website. When I visit your website privacy badger says that sudleyplace.com is not tracking me and so it doesn't get blocked. \nFor yourself you can move the slider to yellow or green for sudleyplace.com to fix the problem. \n. This is because privacy badger is currently incompatible with Multiprocess firefox. You can fix this by disabling multiprocess firefox in about:preferences. We are tracking this issue here: #208 \n. firstRun is the page which gets loaded on the first run of privacy badger which explains how to use privacy badger. Not sure if I can do anything about this. \n. Can you send me an example of a page where s3.fightforthefuture.org is loaded as a third party resource? \n. Do you happen to have multiprocess firefox enabled?\n. This should be fixed as of privacy badger 1.8.1 , please update your addons \n. This is probably fixed by the move to web extensions. Wontfix in the legacy branch. \n. This should now be fixed :)\n. Does the chrome version break mapillary as well? We are moving to web extensions soon, so this may no longer be an issue then. \n. cool, so hopefull this will be fixed by the webextensions release then. Trying to get that out very soon. Sorry for the trouble!\n. this is really a separate question, but eventually yes. This is contingent on firefox supporting web extensions in mobile which they currently don't. \n. I am halting all development on this version of privacy badger in favor of getting a web extension compatible version out. This will share the same codebase with https://github.com/efforg/privacybadgerchrome\n. Is your issue reproducable with the chrome version of privacy badger?\n. I am halting all development on this version of privacy badger in favor of getting a web extension compatible version of privacy badger for firefox released. This will share the same codebase with https://github.com/efforg/privacybadgerchrome. I imagine that this will not be an issue once that happens.\n. EFF Developer here.\nFor all of you I need to know, do you have multiprocess firefox (E10S) Enabled?  You can check in settings. If you do, does privacy badger work again if you disable multiprocess firefox?\n. okay this was apparently not a multiprocess problem. I found the fix for this and I will release a new version today. \n. @b1teman it will auto update. You will know you got it because privacy badger will work again!\n. the fixed version will be 1.8.0\n. Correct. \nOn August 8, 2016 2:08:57 PM PDT, b1teman notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThe update will come thru the update function in my Add-ons Manager\nsection in FF v48?\n\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/792#issuecomment-238378129\n\n\nSent from my Android device with K-9 Mail. Please excuse my brevity.\n. That is a separate issue, please open a new issue. \n. It certainly can't hurt to block third party cookies in addition to running privacy badger! Privacy badger will only block cookies once they look like they are tracking you, so yea you might block some additional stuff! Note that this will make privacy badger slower to block things since one of the main indicators it uses to decide whats tracking you is the cookies that things set. But that's okay! \n. Can you open the browser console and tell me if there are any errors there? Also please try disabling and re-enabling privacy badger in about:addons\n. can you please add a screenshot?\n. Hi, we have now switched to https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger as the codebase for both firefox and chrome as of the next version of privacy badger. If you are still having this issue as of the next update please re post your issue there. . Nope. The new version will be 2016.12.8\nAnd the correct link is https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger\n. Sorry this is happening, we will look into it! \n. This should be fixed by the switch to web extensions. \n. So as I said, we are working on porting the chrome version of privacy badger to firefox. I am hoping to have it done by next month. After that I think that this issue will no longer be a problem . \n. I am unable to reporoduce this testing on https://sharemenot.cs.washington.edu/Test%20Installation.shtml#.V7dThJ-QlhE with firefox and pb. Do you have any non standard settings in firefox? e.g. blocking third party content or something? Are there any errors in the browser console?\n. It looks like unblocking books.googleusercontent.com in your privacy badger settings should fix this issue. \n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. This will be fixed by the switch to web extensions. \n. I am unable to reproduce this. How are you whitelisting the sites? Please give me step by step details on how to reproduce this, preferably with screenshots. \n. You have our approval for the fork! (I like ammnesiac aardvark, let me also suggest privacy raccoon, or security stoat) \nCredit to us would be great, maybe just mention in your readme or whatever that it is a fork of privacy badger by EFF. Feel free to list us as one of the authors. \n:smile: good luck with the project! I'm glad you are bringing privacy badger to pale moon! \n. lol yea good luck with that! I do not envy the task ahead of you!\n.  You are absolutely correct. Because of privacy badger's heuristic it does generate a unique block list for each user. An attacker with control of n different third parties could randomly decide to set tracking or not on each of them. After those n parties were loaded on 3 different sites the tracking ones could be blocked. Via introspection about which domains loaded the attacker would then be able to get n bits of entropy to identify the person. With 32 domains this would be enough to uniquely identify everyone. \nUnfortunately I don't think there is anything that we can do about this attack, but I am certainly open to suggestions. \n. Peter are you using the latest version of pb from AMO or EFF (just to make sure you aren't using a strange dev copy or something :smile: )\nCould you run a cpu profile if this happens again to see if we can figure out what is happening?\n. Hi, we have now switched to https://github.com/eff.org/privacybadger as the codebase for both firefox and chrome as of the next version of privacy badger. If you are still having this issue as of the next update please re post your issue there. . oops! Thanks for that. Should be rolling out on tuesday. . This UI will be disabled onece we switch to web extensions so closing this issue for now. \n. The plan is to remove this feature and replace it with a click to play widget, such as how social widgets currently get replaced, or soundcloud. This would allow the user to temporarily load disqus when they wish. \n. added npmcdn.com to the cookieblock list. Thanks! \n. :smile_cat: \n. I can add framasoft.org to our cookie block list which will then stop it from setting cookies but still allow it to load but to completely whitelist it let me suggest that you adopt our Do Not Track policy which can be found at https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy. Hi @sonicou \nI'm not convinced that checking for updates on startup presents more of a fingerprinting problem than checking for them every 24 hours. I do it on startup because some people don't consistently leave their browser open for 24 hours straight (much less a week!) and might then never receive the update. \nI would consider checking for updates on startup and then again 1 week later. Or storing the update time in local storage and then only checking once per week. But I'm still not clear on how that actually limits fingerprinting. Could you clarify that for me? \nAlso, we have now switched to https://github.com/eff.org/privacybadger as the codebase for both firefox and chrome as of the next version of privacy badger. Would you mind posting your issue there instead? (and making any future pull requests against that repo instead?). @sonicou that is a fair point. I would accept a pull request that ran the check every 24 hours instead of every time the browser is started. But please make that PR against https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger instead. .

I chose this text because it is what we have on the chrome version of this plugin, and IMO we should make both versions as similar as possible. I am open to other suggestions on the text though, but I think a slightly more verbose approach helps the user understand what is going on with this window.\n. At the time I wrote this there was no way to attach a seperate CSS file to a specific tab. Now you can do it but only as of firefox 34. I am reluctant to use this API until we can mark 34 as the min version. Which is still a ways off I think.\n. In this case I plan to add the commented code back in later. But right now pb is architechted in such a way that I can't support this feature. Is there a best practice for what I should do in this case? Should I remove the code and leave a TODO note, or a link to the appropriate github issue?\n. This is not an error case, simply a work around because for some reason my debugging console will only display messages of level error and not of level 'log'. I have changed it back to console.log. There is no other logging facility that I should be using.\n. AFAIK there  is no way to load another file from an addon from within a content script. If you know of a way to do this then I could load the file with an XHR request and do some templating to insert the variables that I need. \n. Good Call. I replaced the X with the unicode symbol you suggested. I don't have a good close icon handy.\n. Fixed space after comment.\n. fixed spacing around i=0\n. Apparently I already made this a function in fact, but somehow this part didn't get refactored to be a function call. Destroying the dialog box is now it's own function.\n. Good call, found a cleaner way to loop through the buttons.\n. This file should actually be deleted since we don't use it any more (the CSS is included inline). But to answer your question, the !important flags are included because, at least in chrome, my css was being overwritten by page specific CSS even though my css is pretty tightly scoped. Rather than looking into why this was happening I added the !important directive, which seemed to fix the problem. This is probably not necessary in firefox since inline css always takes precedence. \n. Fixed\n. Added a note about this, to refactor later.\n. Every request gets checked to see if it is an exception. This just filters out requests that don't have an associated window. I don't think it is important enough to deserve a log message.\n. Ugh, this is gross... definitely changing to the more idiomatic !!\n. fixed.\n. Good call. Fixed.\n. I'm not sure of the answer to this question. The documentation also does not seem to indicate.\n. fixed.\n. fixed.\n. Agreed that this is a weird function and is probably due for a refactor. I didn't write it so I can't really comment on the 'why's of it.\n. Also agreed that this would be the preferable exports style. There are several inconsistent style issues throughout this code base. The whole code base is frankly due for some spring cleaning and refactoring. \n. Done.\n. Debugging message that was left in there.\n. Removed this and I am now passing in a concatenation of the host and path instead. Added JSDoc\n. Agreed, added note.\n. Done.\n. Done\n. Good catch, changed it to use the real URL.\n. Good point. Fixed.\n. Agreed, that is also my personal style as well. I think this style was from another coder. Fixed. Also fixed this everywhere else in the code base.\n. Nit: inconsistent indentation, please use 2 spaces instead of 4\n. Nit: more inconsistent spaces, use 2 instead of 4 throughout this file.\n. This console.log statement is super spammy, please remove it or change it's level to debug.\n. how long since your last confession my son?\n. delete this line, no reason to leave it commented\n. These three lines should probably be added to translation.\n. should this be fb://share_button ? What is the fb url used for?\n.

I was informally trying to approximate a Huffman code without having the real data.  Since I saw about 8 really common cookie values (like \"\", \"True\", \"true\", etc), I assigned 3 bits to each of those; since there were ~200 language codes I used 8 bits for those, etc.\nThe Right Way to do this is to have a large real-world dataset of cookie names and values.  Perhaps you guys could collect one with Lightbeam?  Except unfortunately there's no completely safe way to encrypt those so that (for instance) the database doesn't allow for brute force attacks on weak auth cookie generators. \n.

This amounts to a feature request for a setting that would make Privacy Badger behave a lot more like Request Policy.  We were tempted to offer that, but it seems like we just won't do as good a job of it as Request Policy does, since RP is designed for that purpose.\nSo I'm going to tag this wonftix for the time being.  @alaricd, if you try out Request Policy and conclude that for some reason you really think this functionality belongs in Privacy Badger, come back and we can discuss it further :)\n. \n.

Probably one of your browsers has seen more first party sites with mathjax embeds than the other.\nAlthough mathjax is \"not a tracker\", it is apparently setting high-entropy third party cookies :/.  We will put it on the cookieblocklist, so that its content still loads but with cookies blocked.\n. Do you close firefox with control-q?  Do you have any other extensions installed?\nI have tried to reproduce this bug, closing firefox 30 about 7 times, without a hang.

I was opening 1-2 pages on each attempt.  I'll try it with a larger bookmarked set soon.  Can you try to reproduce with different sets of extensions?  It can be best to do that in a new profile, via \"firefox -P -no-remote\" on the command line.\n. This is almost certainly not a Privacy Badger bug.  It's probably actually an OCSP error at GoDaddy, or conceivably another Firefox addon that's causing this.  You can work around it if you want by making OCSP checking optional rather than mandatory in the Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Certificates -> Validation menu.  If you can reproduce the error now, and then determine that disabling Privacy Badger causes it to cease immediately, please reopen.\n. There are three ways to try to fix this.\n1. Stop setting cookies off mozilla.org.  But presumably some of them are required for auth?\n2. Post a dnt-policy.txt file on mozilla.org.  Alex and I have had a todo item about figuring out whether this is possible for a while, perhaps we should nudge him?\n3. Add mozilla.org to the cookieblocking whitelist, which will load the content but block the cookies in 3rd party contexts.  That could be an acceptable workaround if mozilla.org is not performing any auth functions on bugzilla.org.\n. Putting mozilla.org on the cookieblock list now, but also bumping the conversation with Alex.\n. The code looks good to me modulo my one comment.  If you've tested it and it's fetching and respecting the policies as expected, go ahead and merge.  If you need me to also test it, LMK.\n. My instinct is that it makes more sense to check at a time when you would be loading a resource from the domain, rather than at startup.  Since the phenomenon of a domain that was previously blocked posting a /.well-known/dnt-policy.txt file is actually likely to be very rare, I don't think there's any latency consideration (we should think about whether we want to have the blocking WebRequest call wait for the dnt policy check or not... I think probably not...)\n24 hours also seems pretty often.  Randomly every 24-72 or 24-168 hours seems ok...\n.

That was e10s landing in nightly.  Apparently it's been backed out again now.\n. Ok, changed the title back.\n. For me, there's a often-but-not-always-reproducibe connection to Firebug being enabled.  When Firebug is present and seeming to cause this issue, enabling Privacy Badger causes this console error:\nconsole.error:\n[CustomizableUI]\nNotFoundError: Node was not found -- :1060\n. The coding side of this is probably a good volunteer task, though any proposed UI should probably be mocked up and polished with the core dev team first.\n. Excuse my ignorance, but how does use of a STUN server prevent IP address revelation in a P2P protocol?\nIn my view it's very good news that WebRTC is facilitating P2P applications in web browsers; there are a lot of cool things that should be implementable as a result.\nHiding the user's IP address isn't part of Privacy Badger's mission, except insofar as we can determine that an origin/IP is tracking the user and providing no functionality they expect, in which case Privacy Badger shuts down all communication with that origin.\nAs a result, it seems that the correct aim is to ensure that any possible tracking via WebRTC is identified as such by Privacy Badger, and if domains are redlisted then WebRTC can't be used as an alternative way to talk to them.\nThe larger aim you have (preventing WebRTC from leaking an IP that is supposed to be hidden by Tor or a VPN) is probably best implemented in Tor Button, or some variant/alternative that's designed for VPN usage.\n. I suppose I wouldn't be completely opposed to adding a \"VPN mode\" to Privacy Badger, which was off by default unless there's some reason to believe that the user is behind a VPN.  But that would be a significantly new objective for the project, and it'd be worth asking whether PB was the best home for that objective.\n. Just to be super clear: it isn't okay for Privacy Badger to break normal uses of P2P WebRTC.\n@elijh When you say \"private IP\" presumably you don't really mean a private IP like 192.168.0.0/16, but a public IP that the VPN was supposed to hide, right?\nIf WebRTC's dependence on UDP + STUN creates a path for public IP address leakage, it only makes sense to deploy a mitigation if the user is actually using a VPN or overlay that would otherwise hide that IP.  And in that case we should ask, why Privacy Badger, rather than TorButton or an extension specifically designed to perform that kind of task?\nIt sounds like there's a separate issue with supercookies being possible in the WebRTC protocol.  In that case, we should implement code to detect such attacks on the user, and blocklist any domains that perform them.\n. Currently unclear if this is really a site bug, a failure to match the design, or simply a consequence of the design.\n. I was able to reproduce this for one disable / reenable cycle with PB. But not two. Will try to catch my browser doing this again...\n. Having a local variable that is (sometimes?) declared over the top of a function argument produces a lot of inclarity.  If you mean to make a new variable here, call it something other than \"iterations\".\n. This callback has an error parameter; you should probably collect and check it!\n. Nit: COPIED rather than COPYING; by the time you print this, it's already done :)\n. You should probably print some error message if .closed is true. I also can't find any docs about the semantics of that error condition; AFAICT this might actually throw an exception rather than (or in addition to?) returning a closed file.\n. How long does this operation take in a profile where PB has been active for a long time?\n. ",

It looks like it was updated recently (22 Sept 2014). His response when I emailed him about this issue a couple days ago (before I thought to check if Privacy Badger had any issues) was:\n\nSDC's whitelist is actually Firefox's site permission database, which is shared. If it contains entries that you did not add yourself, it is likely that some other add-on added them (possibly an ad-financed one) to make sure it could always set tracking cookies. SDC picks those entries up, because it can't tell them apart from cookie permissions that you have added manually.\n\nSo it looks like it is using the same list as PB.\nI was previously using Ghostery and never had this conflict with SDC.\n. I have a similar problem. I use Self-Destructing Cookies to kill cookies when I'm done with a website, and found Privacy Badger adds domains to the whitelist including what look like advertising and tracking cookies (optimizely, webtrendslive, 2o7, doubleclick....), as well as google, bing, and other sites I don't need leaving cookies on my computer when I close their tab.\nI never had this problem with Ghostery.\nVersion 0.1.4\n. I am getting this Privacy Badger Alert on two websites I regularly visit and use disqus for the comments. I also selected \"Always allow disqus\" but upon reloading the page, the popup reappears.\nI am using Firefox 34 Linux. I have to completely disable Privacy Badger until this gets fixed. \n. Glad this is fixed. Thanks.\n. I just ran into the \"Loading...\" issue with a fresh install of privacy badger.  Manually disabling it and re-enabling it fixed the issue, it seems to be working fine now.  I tried disabling and re-enabling the preferences first but that didn't work for me.  I'm using Firefox 36.0.4, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, and privacy badger 0.2.5.  My other extensions are Clearly 10.2.1.7, Evernote Web Clipper 5.9.1, HTTPS Everywhere 5.0.1, Lastpass 3.1.1, openSUSE Firefox Extensions 1.0.2, and Reddit Enhancement Suite 4.5.4\n. A fresh install of 0.2.6 looks like it's correctly blocking trackers on install.  Thanks for the great work!\n. I already found the option (\"social widget replacement enabled\").\nSolved\n. Thanks, @cooperq.\nSo this is fixed in v 0.99?\nIs this version already available on the website?\nOr does Privacy Badger update automatically?\n. Incognito mode should offer more protection than browsing without Privacy Badger enabled.  I think it should carry the rules accumulated from browsing non-Incognito as a read-only list but not start from scratch.\nIncognito was initially to protect yourself from other people who could check out your browser history client-side but it should also help you to browse without being tracked by server-side 3rd parties.\nAnother way to look at it is an add-on endorsed by the EFF should not expose history of a private browsing session to a non-private web session... but the rules accumulated in a non-private session could be enforced read-only in a private session.\nHaving rules gathered from Incognito write to the list essentially cripples Incognito function.  I'd just check someone's Privacy Badger settings for their history.\n. Same Problem here. But i think i found it.\nIm using Cookie Monster as Plugin to cookie for special websites. The Firefox Cookie handling is disabled and PB Menu shows only \"Loading....\"\nAfter enabling the Firefox Cookie Manangent PB shows the normal tracking screen.\nChanging the 3rd Party Cookie switch Firefox dosn't change anything.\nDisabling Firefox Cookie -> \"Loading...\"\nEnabling Firefox Cookie -> Normal behaviour\n. Today update to Firefox 40.0, same error with newer version number.\n. I want to give more feedback.\nI just uninstalled Firefox 32bit and installed Firefox 64bit beta.\nFirefox does not show the \"not responding\" message but it is hanging a little..\nThere is no error in this page (ctrl+shift+j)\nYou can ask me more about it, do not hesitate. I want to help. You can remote my laptop on Teamviewer if you want.\n. here is what I saw on Firefox 32bit (ctrl+shift+j)\nscreenshot : http://i.imgur.com/uJZQaRA.png\n.

You're going around submitting a ton of these tickets essentially unblocking tracking cookies.\nhttps://github.com/anonsubmitter\n. I understand what you're saying but what you suggest to fix is what you'd do if you want to use them.  If they do not honor Do Not Track then that's what you'd have to do but it's a commenting system based on a tracking mechanism.  The whole concept is to make a tracker into a feature... which isn't great.  I just allow it temporarily if I am compelled to read or write comments but it's not as if I want it to follow me around everywhere Disqus is.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus#Criticism_and_privacy_concerns\nYou're going around submitting a ton of these tickets essentially unblocking tracking cookies.\nhttps://github.com/anonsubmitter\n. I don't know.  I mean, you may identify a pattern in some instances.  Say, if 3 sites are indeed owned by the same company there could be a reason content is identified as 3rd party if it's shared amongst the sites.  I just have the  mindset this add-on relies on heuristic to determine what to blacklist.  I mean, Disqus is widely used and feels legit because it serves one purpose but then it's not a free service for website developers out of the good nature of an organization.\nAny time you see it on a page it's tracking which sites you visited so they can track your interests... it's really up to you but I just question why something is being blocked when the app is monitoring how many sites stuff shows on.  This isn't an add-on like Adblock Plus which is built around a blocklist and exceptions.  I've had about 450 potential 3rd party tracking domains logged in the app and my browsing isn't affected.  It's pretty crazy.  Still, they're only potentials because they've been 3rd party at least once.  Until they appear on 3 separate website domains they're still allowed to do what they do.\nIt's like fonts.googleapis.com https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started (or whatever it is) is a font Google puts out that developers can use to \"make the web beautiful.\"  It's Google- put out a neat font but really it's a tracker.  I like this add-on for being relatively agnostic.  It being endorsed by the EFF it should be.\n. on the Filter Settings screen you'd have 2 additional columns \"Unique Sites\" & \"Total Hits\"... something like that.\nI also think adding that total count up top to the main pop-up window as well.\nIf there were timestamps logged somewhere you could timeline somewhere.  There could be some simple cool analytics somewhere with minimal extra collection as long as it isn't something that can be construed as a privacy concern in itself.  Like a timestamp the first time a 3rd party content is logged, then graph a daily count for the past month & monthly count for the past 12 months or something.\nI could almost see an estimated bandwidth saved, say, if it takes 3 counts before something is blocked the content had to have been downloaded 3 times anyways.  Take an average of the 3 sizes and store it, then put that number in a data point and anytime that content is hit and blocked that avg size is guessed as a savings.\nSay, fonts.google.com content was downloaded at 30KB, 60KB and 90KB before the block was made.  Any additional hit would be a 60KB estimated savings.\nI tried that sessbench thing gorhill made for Chrome and Privacy Badger definitely improves over time.  After I'm done browsing for a while (me at least) Privacy Badger gets pretty darn aggressive.\nJust click on a bunch of posts on https://www.reddit.com/r/news/ and you've got 300+ trackers fairly quickly.\n. or at least the wording should be improved. IMHO\n. Finally got it to update. Works Great!!! \nThanks Again!\n. This will probably be fixed by EFForg/privacybadgerchrome#845\nWill this fix Firefox V48? Also dose EFF know about this issue?\n. I use FF v48 looked for it when I typed about:supprt and found this. \"Multiprocess Windows  0/2 (Disabled)\". I just saw you will release a new vertion today. How will I get that and how will I know I got it?\n. I use FF v48 looked for it when I typed about:supprt and found this. \"Multiprocess Windows  0/2 (Disabled)\".

I've try it with a different setting and the icon was visible.\nIf you say that now I have to report this issue to https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/11, then I will not!!!\nBecause in my opinion, wich is different than yours, the issue still exists and this his the right place to report it!\nYou just have to read the title of this issue to know that I'm right:\nNo PB icon in toolbar on GNU Icecat 24 and Firefox 29\nSo close the issue!\nI've seen this type of action by developers all over the web!\nWhen a person becames to insisting about an issue, and you don't have a answer to it, you simply descart it (the issue) and her (the person).\nBecause of your prepotent arrogance, you just lost a user!\nBut what is one user?

They were not deleted when the tab was closed!!\nOnly when I close Firefox and reopen it, will Google ask me for both my email and password.\nIn the private browsing setting, this doesn't hapen. When you close a tab, all history is immediatly deleted!\nThe point beeing, this issue is NOT solved!\nOnce again, our opinions are not the same!\nThe ball is in your court now.\nEDIT: Sorry, there are three things:\nThird, isn't PB similar in behaviour to the Add-on Disconnect (I'm sure you know it!)?\nBecause if they are similar in behaviour, I have it installed, and working with no issues! The icon is shown, it blocks adds, etc and all this with the setting \"Never Remember History\" enable.\n. Hi, well, I have a similar situation! I installed Privacy Badger TODAY on both Firefox and Google Chrome and the icon DOES NOT APPEAR ANYWHERE IN FIREFOX!\n In Chrome does, BUT NOT IN FIREFOX!\nI tried to remove it and reinstall it several times, but still nothing!\nI removed other extensions and I reinstall it and nothing!\nNo icon anywhere to be seen!\nIn another note, I don't understand why you closed this bug without a single reply or a solution, because the bug still exists!\nI'm using Firefox 29 and 32!

So, your issue might be related, or not -- hence, I'd suggest you open another ticket, and include a link to this one in your description.\n. @garrettr, this is a native feature[1].\nIcons that were destroyed on that custom bar (which was, itself, not destroyed), come from various addons including NoScript, FlashBlock, Better Privacy etc. or FWIW, \"Toolbar Buttons\" [2].\n[1] https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customize-firefox-controls-buttons-and-toolbars#w_how-can-i-add-extra-toolbars\n[2] https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toolbar-buttons/\n. @diracdeltas No. I've updated Privacy Badger to 0.1.2 using Firefox's native addon manager, which found the update and I restarted the browser. Then I found its icon in the \"addon\" bar. I moved it back to the custom toolbar at the same location as I had placed it in my first attempt, then restarted the browser: gone again, with all other icons located to its right.\nHad you succeeded to reproduce it? Was 0.1.2 expected to fix it?\n. @diracdeltas \nFirst of all, have you please been able to reproduce this issue? Or not?\nFYI, in this profile I've had using \"Classic Theme Restorer\" (https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/classicthemerestorer/), since Iceweasel's latest upgrade. Apparently, Mozilla simply decided to release their new \"Customize Toolbars\" UI while reducing our ability to customize any extra toolbar : neither the add-on toolbar, nor All-In-One, nor the extra toolbar, were customizable any more here, so I would qualify this UI release as a mess for me. \"Classic Theme Restorer\" seem to have fixed those other issues here.\nPlease note, even with the help of \"Classic Theme Restorer\", both Adblock Edge and Privacy Badger were still breaking the toolbar upon activation and browser restart. Hence, I think this \"Classic\" add-on was not the sole cure for the present issue.\nNext, since its latest 2.1.3 release, activating AdBlock Edge stopped breaking the toolbar. I gave it a go after I read their release notes, where numerous toolbar/icon-related fixes were announced (see https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-edge/?src=ss#detail-relnotes)\nOnly then, I had another go with Privacy Badger and in this profile, it Just Worked\u2122.

That can additionally take color, but then it wouldn't purely be signaling status by color.\nExamples of symbols to use in addition to color might be:\n- checkmark/-/X\n- circle/triangle/exclamation mark\n- text like o/~/! or ./?/!\n.

The first thing I encountered after it was installed was the first-run screen and the red icon. My thought: \"Weird, Privacy Badger seems to be blocking something on chrome pages.\" Of course, I soon figured out that the red means nothing, but as the face of the extension it seems like a good thing to prioritize.\n. I'm guessing something like this could be a good solution: http://w2ui.com/web/blog/7/JavaScript-Grid-with-One-Million-Records\nBasically, rather than render the entire table at once, render it as the user scrolls.

Not in the toolbar, not in the \"Customize Nightly\" interface. No messages in the dev console that I've seen. Maybe it's working and the icon is missing?

The user did not choose to visit or otherwise interact with Google Analytics.\nWhether or not Google Analytics is useful (or benign) to the visited website and user is orthogonal to it's status as 3rd party website.\n\n3rd Party means that you chose to load some kind of script from a separate party (this is still 1st party) but that separate party decided to load more scripts that the website didn't choose to load.\n\nNo. 3rd party means that the website a user visits chooses to load resources from a separate party. It is from the perspective of the user not the website.\n. @skorokithakis \n\nThird-party tracking cookies are cookies that are shared between websites. If you visit a.com and GA can read its cookie from a.com or b.com, that's third-party tracking.\n\nThe \"same origin\" policy means user agents such as web browsers should prevent a.com from accessing cookies set by b.com and vice versa.\nSeparately, GA has the concept of cross-domain tracking whereby the owner of multiple (perhaps otherwise unrelated) domains can consolidate them in GA. Relies on these domains cooperatively sharing visitor identifier data (same info contained in cookies) to bypass the \"same origin\" policy's restrictions.\n. Same setup here. Add-on shows in the list, but all functionality is missing, and the icon has disappeared from my add-on bar.\n. I am also running HTTPS Everywhere, that is it. PB version 0.2.5 and Firefox version 36. Because I've never used the counter, I'm not sure when exactly it started not detecting anything but it was definitely working last year.\n. I am not OP, but the problem has happened to me twice.  Both times were after Firefox automatically upgraded itself, most recently to Firefox 37.0.1.  This time, trackers reappeared after disabling and enabling either Automatic Blocking or Social Widget Replacement.  I did not notice the trackers being listed until after re-enabling Social Widget Replacement, but it may have happened before then.  I closed the Addons tab after each change in state of each single checkbox, but I don't know if that would have mattered.\nHowever, they had turned green despite not having touched the sliders.  I thought there might still be something wrong, so I reinstalled PB 0.2.6 over my 0.2.6 without closing Firefox.  Ads continued to appear since the sliders were green, so I restarted Firefox hoping that would re-enable the old slider settings.  Trackers were green after restarting but changed to red and yellow after a few site visits, so I guess the data was reset.\nThe first time this happened when an earlier version of Firefox updated, I think I only toggled each of the checkbox options and restarted Firefox before I noticed the sliders again.\nI had the following extensions loaded when FF updated and tracker sliders disappeared: Privacy Badger 0.2.6, about:addons-memory 10, BetterPrivacy 1.68, Copy Pure Text 2.0.5, Firebug 2.0.9, FxIF 0.4.8.1, HTTPS-Everywhere 5.0.1, Image Search Options 2.0.2, NoScript 2.6.9.21, Passive Cache 1.3b, Self-Destructing Cookies 0.4.7\nBy the way, E10S is on by default in Firefox 37.0.1\nAs for now, I guess I won't know if the bug was fixed until Firefox updates again.\n. Hello I have the same problem. At first it works fine but after visiting certain websites the problem occurs. Afterwards it doesn't detect trackers on any website.\n. I am having a similar issue. PB is not detecting any trackers on websites that are full of them e.g. Facebook and Twitter.\n. I have found that the issue is resolved by disabling my Avast Anti-virus software which seemed to block the connection to www.eff.org.  Once Avast was disabled, the installation progressed with no problems.\nHowever, it would be most helpful if there was a link that gave prospective Privacy Badger users the option to download the .xpi file via a separate link which could then be dragged into the Firefox browser to allow installation to take place.\nalba1314.\n. You are the lucky ones, at least you have slider functionality, where in my case (FF39) :\nhttp://picload.org/image/ipcpwdc/privacybadger06.08.2015-02.png\nI\u2019m stuck entirely. Badger is working his job, but entire interface is frozen loading is never finished:\nMy case described in more detail  : https://tinyurl.com/nt2vs4s\nLatest FF39 WS20003/WinXP/Win7 exactly the same problem\n. Experiencing this same problem on Mac OS X 10.9.5 and Firefox 39.0.3\n. I've got the same problem. Win Vista, FF 39.0.3. The Popup looks as in the first posting, without the red part.\n----------- When Popup is opened ----------------\nDOMException [SecurityError: \"The operation is insecure.\"\ncode: 18\nnsresult: 0x80530012\nlocation: resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/loader/sandbox.js -> resource://jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-at-jetpack/privacybadger/data/popup.js:43]\n----------- When signing in to GitHub this error happens multiple times ----------------\nTypeError: channel.originalURI is undefined\nStack-Trace:\nonExamineResponse@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-at-jetpack/privacybadger/lib/main.js:129:1\nObserver<.observe@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/system/events.js:72:7\n. My UI works now, after setting dom.storage.enabled to \"true\" in about:config, as per billux in #486.  FF 39.0.3 on OSX 10.9.5\n. If you want to fix the UI problem without accepting all cookies, add the resource \"domain\" for Privacy Badger to your cookie whitelist:\n1. Click the Privacy Badger toolbar icon to display its dialog.\n2. Click on the gear icon and drag it to your tab bar to open that image in a new tab.\n3. From the address bar, copy the \"domain\" portion of the resource:// URL to the clipboard. In my case, this is jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-at-jetpack. (I'm not sure whether this value changes on a per-install basis, so compare to your own.)\n4. In your cookie management tool, add that \"domain\" to your whitelist. For Firefox's default cookie management:\n- Go to Preferences\u2192Privacy\n- Click the Exceptions button\n- Paste the \"domain\" into the Address of website: field\n- Click the Allow button to add the exception\n- Click the Save Changes button\nUpon adding this exception, the Privacy Badger UI should work as expected. \n. @cooperq I believe the root problem is Privacy Badger attempting to write to localStorage when the browser is configured to block cookies (and by extension localStorage, since they use the same permissions.) This throws the Operation is insecure error, and also explains why whitelisting the \"domain\" to allow localStorage remedies the problem. The add-on needs to handle this error gracefully and/or explain how affected users can fix it.\n. I too am experiencing this. FF 40.0 Ubuntu 14.04. As soon as the Badger's over 1300 tracking domains load in Options, I get an unresponsive script warning for \"Script: resource://gre/modules/commonj\u2026/jquery-ui/js/jquery-1.10.2.js:762\" and FF goes unresponsive except for repeated such warnings whether I hit stop or continue. When I hit debug, a debugger shows up at the bottom of the browser but it gives no useful information up front and I don't know how to use it to get you something helpful. FF does, however, become responsive again, allowing me to close the PB Options tab or navigate to other tabs so long as the debugger is up.\nI'd be glad to follow any instructions you can give me to help you get more info to debug this; I'll keep checking back here.\n-Mo\n. My Matrox Parhelia used for DPI precision, while being unmatched at what it does, has no hardware acceleration for anything later then 2004, so everything \"modern\" like flash is handled strictly by CPU power. Sometimes when in weekly long uptime without refresh, FF/flash can show signs of latency. So I thought, possibly PB slowing in Option menu : https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/487\nis due to my own peculiar setup, glad to learn it is not. I suppose depending on you CPU power it takes less then five seconds while PB\u2019s Options are available. Then I can scroll up and down without any delays. There is a latency of five seconds, at least in my case,  each time you move rule slider. Then each takes five seconds for menu to be accessible again.\nMark\n. When you open Options and you find six hundreds or more tracking domains, and you learn that at least 40% are in green mode, things are not pleasant or easy. In order to sort them all to your liking,\nwith CPU hog issue, this would takes hours.\nUntil this is sorted, but also generally speaaking, have you considered making global setting rule for all domains in Option settings?  It would be some much easier if we could tag all domains in Yellow or Red, specially with CPU hog issue.\n. ooops...i didnt see.\nthx!\n. i want close the issue now for duplicate reasons.\n. Cooperq,\nthanks you for your help. Those links are not complete, but once I learned about the exact version,\nit was easy to find them here : \nhttps://eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.99.xpi\nhttps://eff.org/files/privacy-badger-0.2.6.xpi\nNo, I\u2019m afraid, 0.99 behaves in exactly the same fashion as the latest PB. While 0.2.6 brings the same superb functionality back to my FF39.  I have disabled updates for 0.2.6, as I follow your announcements here. If I can assist you in any way, I would gladly install 0.99 back, just tell me what you need from me and I will gladly supply the data.\n. Cooperq,\nprecisely this : http://picload.org/image/ipcpwdc/privacybadger06.08.2015-02.png\nas described here: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/457\nexactly the same behavior 0.99/1.0, or simply said,  absolutely frozen UI \nI even like default red color and purity of 0.2.6., but forgive this comment as it is from personal preference, and not related to our issue with UI\nMark\n. Cooperq,\nPB 1.0.0 : http://freetexthost.com/jxhrdlh10o \nor even more sorted :  http://freetexthost.com/nq1zo4refl\nBut guess what, now that tried again 0.99, and I have actually tried more sites, suddenly 0.99 works:\nhttp://picload.org/image/iwgoarp/privacybadger0.99.0-12.08.2015.png\nErrors are no strangers in 0.99 : http://freetexthost.com/upeoi2fmjc\nbut, I repeat, 0.99 is actually working great no issues so far. And looking at the changes, I see the reasons, and I see the proof and they are surely welcomed\nMark\n. Well,  on that note:  http://picload.org/image/iwrdgaw/privacybadger12.08.2015-04.png\nLooking at my laptop and desktops while using new UI, I have to say, elaborate and much more efficient. \nBut, Cooperq, allow me to ask you just one question. I see those small badgers on many forums/sites:  http://picload.org/image/iwrdgai/privacybadger12.08.2015-03.png\nand I wonder, since in 0.2.6 this was never seen. Is this due to improvements made in later versions, or could be taken as result of  \"glitches\" while finalizing of updating present version? Or simply said, should I see those things, or should they be hidden from my view?  Just asking to understand, whether this is normal.\nThanks for your attention\nMark\n. @Cooperq,\n1.0.1 UI starts fine, but PB found no tracker on any site, so that made me suspicious. There was no errors reported, but on every page that was filled with trackers, PB was claiming nothing to declare.\nSo I went Options/Filter Settings and once I touched a few, then PB came back to life and with proper amount of detection. \nAlso, \"Filter Settings\" takes too much CPU. The moment it is closed CPU goes back to normal. I\u2019ve tried closing FF process to make sure, but it remains CPU hungry whenever I go back to \"Filter Settings\" also, trying to scroll takes even more CPU power (over 70%) and it has waiting period of several seconds until I\u2019m allowed to move further. Other then that 1.0.1 seems to fully functional\nMark\n. It's not unsafe per se, it's just unsigned.  Firefox 40 is set up to warn about unsigned extensions and many current add-ons aren't signed yet.  Signing won't be enforced until Firefox 41.  It would be a good idea for Privacy Badger to start signing before then.  http://www.ghacks.net/2015/06/19/how-to-disable-the-firefox-40-add-on-signing-requirement/\n. Confirming bug on Firefox in Windows 7 as well. Maps were working yesterday and do not work today. Disabling Privacy Badger enables Google Maps to work again.\n. @Jeff,\nFar from suggesting, that this should not be resolved. But, consider for how many Google scripts you already have to give permission, in order to have any function of Gmaps.\nAnd using PB means, you already use at least a few more privacy tools, since they are all set, what is the point of giving them permission for something so intrusive like Gmaps?\nHave you consider using portable Browser on USB, or on virtual OS, dedicated for such purpose, it will save you a lots of time and hassle when you really need things like Gmaps.\nJust a thought\n. @jawz101 \n- I tried to manually update PB from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 (due to #620) since Firefox didn't notify me about any available updates. I also ended up with two entries in the Add-ons list. My PB settings weren't reset though. Not sure why your settings were reset.\n- I uninstalled the newly installed 1.0.2 because I didn't want to lose my settings. I'll wait for a proper update that Firefox can detect as an update.\n@cooperq \nAny plans to release 1.0.2 and later versions in such a manner that Firefox recognizes them as updates to the existing installed PB add-on?\n. @cooperq \nI don't remember where 1.0.1 came from. 1.0.2 came from EFF since the mozilla version was still showing as 1.0.1 when i tried.\n. @cooperq \nI found the files jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi and jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ-eff@jetpack.xpi in %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\********.default\\extensions. From the dates, I determined that my PB 1.0.1 came from addons.mozilla.org. The EFF version is the installation I described above (I must have disabled 1.0.2 rather than uninstall as I reported).\nThe addons.mozilla.org version hasn't been updated. - it is still listed as 1.0.1. Any plans to update this in sync with the EFF version?\n. Just tried this and it is blocked for me too.\nThinking about this a bit more, if 'graph.facebook.com' fixes the issue, it would seem this isn't a problem with PB but rather a problem with the flowlab.io site's implementation (unless the video really is hosted at graph.facebook.com).\n. This particular issue is with install.rdf. PaleMoon no longer has the same uuid as firefox, so you need:\n Firefox \n<em:targetApplication>\n  <Description>\n    <em:id>{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}</em:id>\n    <em:minVersion>26.0</em:minVersion>\n    <em:maxVersion>30.0</em:maxVersion>\n  </Description>\n  <Description>\n    <em:id>{8de7fcbb-c55c-4fbe-bfc5-fc555c87dbc4}</em:id>\n    <em:minVersion>26.0</em:minVersion>\n    <em:maxVersion>39.0</em:maxVersion>\n  </Description>\n</em:targetApplication>\n. As another data point, imdb isn't being blocked here too:\n\n. @fiskr \nI was using PB v1.0.1. Firefox didn't inform me of an available update.\nI note that you don't have a scroll bar showing on Gizmodo even with more trackers in your list than mine. Can you try on a site with even more trackers (enough to need a scroll bar)?\n@cooperq \nIt is a Firefox issue. Not Chrome.\n. @cooperq \nI don't remember. Any way to check?\nAlso, is there any way to preserve settings and state so I can simply re-install from addons.mozilla.org (or whereever is the best source) in any case without losing my settings or the current state of the trackers?\n. I found the file jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ-eff@jetpack.xpi in %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\********.default\\extensions. Guess that answers the question?\nBut, it didn't and still hasn't auto-updated.\n@cooperq @fiskr \nIs there any way to save and restore the settings and tracker lists state in PB?. I'd like to save it all, install from a source that will update correctly then, restore it all. \n. Just to expand on my previous post, I've also found jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi in %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\********.default\\extensions.\nSeems my original install was indeed from addons.mozilla.org and the EFF installation file I reported previously was the 1.0.2 I installed a few days ago that created a second entry in the Add-Ons list (I must have disabled rather than uninstalled it).\nSo, if I can save/restore PB tracker state and settings, I can transition to the EFF version and would then be able to update to later versions. Right?\n. @fiskr @cooperq \nRemoved my current PB 1.0.1 (installed from addons.mozilla.org) and replaced it with with PB 1.0.2 (installed from EFF). The issue remains:\nFirefox 41.0 on Windows 32-bit\n\n. The appearance of the scrollbar is not as important as I first thought. With less entries in the tracker list and a scrollbar, this is what I see:\n\n. Oh, I give up!. There's no obvious pattern to this behaviour that I can see:\n\n. @fiskr \nI noticed that gap too, it is also in the original image from PB 1.0.1. For avoidance of doubt, I was scrolled all the way to the end of the list in all instances. That is a prerequisite for this issue.\nHere's a before/after image of the tracker list scrolled to the last item showing the tooltip display issue:\n\n. @cooperq \nOP here.\nFirefox 41.0.1, Privacy Badger 1.0.2, Windows Vista 32-bit, 1280x800 display.\nOnly other add-on is BetterPrivacy 1.68.1-signed\n@flovo \nI don't get the behaviour in step 4. Once a page results in an obscured tooltip, it generally remains that way.\nI can say that it only happens with about 15 or more trackers in the list. However, as one of my previous comments in this issue demonstrates, I have seen the tooltip correctly displayed with 48 trackers in the list. Curious...\n. @flovo \nThat you get both a scroll bar and this issue with only 6 trackers is another interesting piece of wierdness. Particularly as 1920x1080 is a higher resolution than mine.\nI don't get a scroll bar until the tracker list has at least 8 items. This what PB looks like with 7 trackers (the popup tooltip on the last item is not obscured):\n\n. @cooperq \nThis might help in your attempts to reproduce this. I can trigger the issue using this method even when there are only 8 items in the tracker list (the scroll bar only appears with 8 or more items on my system). It isn't a 100% guaranteed however...\n1. Navigate to a page with enough trackers that the scroll bar is present\n2. Scroll to the last item in the list\n3. Hover mouse cursor over last item in list\n4. If the popup tooltip is not obscured, drag the scroll bar thumb/scroller to the top of the list and then back to the end of the list one or more times then, try hovering over the last item again\nIn step 4, you can also try clicking the scroll bar track to move the thumb/scroller up and down if dragging it doesn't trigger the issue.\n. OP here again.\n@fiskr\nJust double-checked here on a Windows system and, yes, if I \n- click on an item (to enable keyboard scrolling) then,\n- hover over the items while scrolling with the keyboard\n  then, the tooltip is indeed visible on the last item in the tracker list.\nHope all this is helpful in fixing this issue @cooperq. I also get the \"scrolling up just a little bit\" behaviour when the tooltip is obscured.\n. There's an option in Firefox for that - just set \"Accept cookies from sites\" setting to \"Never\" in  Preferences -> Privacy panel.\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/settings-privacy-browsing-history-do-not-track#w_use-custom-settings-for-history_2\n. Hello, I think you misunderstood me.  I'm aware of that option in Firefox (and in Chrome it's going into \"Incognito\" mode), but I'm asking if the Privacy Badger add-on could have an option to block (Yellowlist) ALL cookies that it finds on the web page automatically?  Ghostery has this option, surely Privacy Badger should have it too, so users have an option to use it?\n. What is the point in list update when browser starts?\nIsn't once per day is enough like firefox and addons.mozilla.org do?\nAlso if user will disable auto list update, he'll still get a new list when new addon version is released.\nI think that ability to control automatic connections is important for a privacy addon.\n. @cooperq \nIs there any detail on changes to the heuristic to combat this overzealous blocking. Would hate to find currently blocked google-related domains (or other organisation's) suddenly unblocked without my input.\n. @joydragon, you can read @cooperq discussing one way of doing this manually here in a comment to issue #632.\nNot \"secure\" nor syncable but, it may help you for now.\n. Can't help feeling this shouldn't have been closed until I had a chance to confirm it is indeed fixed in PB 1.0.3.\nNevertheless, thanks @cooperq, I'll look out for PB 1.0.3.\n. OP here.\nThis issue still exists in PB 1.0.3. The dialog box often does not appear but, the unresponsiveness is still present.\nThe issue shouldn't have been closed until it had been confirmed fixed in PB 1.0.3.\n. Same here. Every part of the interface is like this for me. Modifying the whitelist? Good luck with that. I had to stop using the extension because of this. It's way beyond unbearable when doing multiple things in the interface.\n. Same issue as #643. \nFixed in 1.0.3 according to @cooperq.\n. Well, I now have 1.0.3 and I still get the unresponsive script warning.\n. Firefox 41.0.2\nPrivacy Badger 1.0.3 (auto-updated from 1.0.2 which was originally installed from eff.org)\nWindows 7 32-bit\nI have the same issue but mine only started after Privacy Badger was auto-updated in Firefox. The previous version 1.0.2 had no warnings.\nThis is what the Add-ons list in Firefox says about PB 1.0.3:\n\n. @ardrigh \nBoth @Flupsy  and myself are aware that the 1.0.3 extension is unsigned. And that Firefox now issues a warning in this case. Just informing the developers that this issue exists in the 1.0.3 release from eff.org.\n. Firefox 41.0.2\nPrivacy Badger 1.0.3 (auto-updated from 1.0.2 which was originally installed from eff.org)\nWindows 7 32-bit\nI get this as well. Seems to be an issue with the version 1.0.3 from eff.org only AFAICT.\n. I doubt PB can be accused of overblocking.\nSome websites may be built in such a way that blocking online tracking breaks the site. This is inconvenient for users of the site and the website owners are hoping that the inconvenience would be enough to get users to abandon attempts to block online tracking (or at least whitelist the offending website). I just use a different website...\nI can't say definitely that these specific domains are tracking (or have ever tracked or might start tracking) users using cookies, javscript or other methods but, it pays to remember that:\n\nIf it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\n-- James Whitcomb Riley\n\nAnyway, you can simply adjust the sliders  for the listed domains to YELLOW yourself.\n. @SwartzCr \nIs there a list of domains that are yellow-listed (or indeed white/green-listed) by default somewhere?\nThe idea that all a publisher needs to do to be eligible for yellow-listing is to include a privacy policy file on their website is worrying. The DNT fiasco taught everyone that publishers cannot be trusted to do what they promise or claim until and unless\n- their compliance can be monitored and\n- non-compliance results in a penalty (e.g. resumption of blocking in PB)\n. This is the initial state:\n\n\n\nEdit: The same as depicted in the third screenshot happens of course as soon as you try to scroll down: Because the pointer now leaves the sensitive area as well, the bubble vanishes, too, and the extended hight of the scrollable area is reduced again.\nMy screen resolution is 1920 x 1200, FF 41.02, Mac OS 10.8.\n(Thanks, BTW, for providing this account!)\n. Hello all.  I agree with original cypherpunk's post, as well as cooperq's short but to the point post and nextLane's post, so I would like to add my back-up to this suggestion as well.  \nWhat I would like to see though for Privacy Badger is the \"green\" slider taken away.  Any invisible trackers Privacy Badger encounters on a web page should be made \"yellow\" straight away, changing to \"red\" further down the line if deemed necessary.\nI don't want Privacy Badger to wait to see if these invisible trackers ignore it's \"Do Not Track\" signal and follow me (and others) across a few websites before deciding to block the cookies or domain.  By then it may be too late and private data and search details may have been sent to the original tracker creator or other parties.\nAlso, I've been told if a user changes the slider settings manually, say to \"yellow\", then Privacy Badger cannot change them (say to \"red\" for domains who ignore the \"Do Not Track\" signal and follow the user) later on.  This is another improvement for Privacy Badger that should be created to increase privacy.\nCreating this suggestion or the original one above to have an option to block all cookies straight away in the next update of Privacy Badger would greatly increase privacy for the user.\nIf you have any influence on this at all cooperq, any chance of implementing these suggestions in further updates of Privacy Badger?  Many thanks.\n. ",

    "macmanx2": "For what it's worth, I don't see the reported problem in Firefox 29.0.1 with Privacy Badger 0.1.3 and the Pocket Javascript bookmarklet. I was able to successfully save an article from http://www.theverge.com/ without any additional steps.\nThis is a nearly fresh Firefox installation just done today with Privacy Badger 0.1.3 as the only addition and no settings changed from default.\n.

Here's a screenshot of Privacy Badger after I realized what was happening:\n\nI went back to http://www.theverge.com/ next and couldn't save anything there either, also noting that getpocket.com was Red.\nI was able to resolve the issue by switching getpocket.com back to Green.\n. No, nothing special like that, just the default \"Firefox will Remember history.\" I should clarify, this is an almost fresh install of Firefox, new profile even, as I haven't used Firefox in quite a while.\nThe only thing that is not new-out-of-the-box-default Firefox 29.0.1 is the addition of Privacy Badger 0.1.3.\n. Confirmed, I was able to reproduce the issue with a fresh un-touched installation of Privacy Badger 0.1.3.\n. Confirmed, the issue is still present in Privacy Badger 0.1.2.\n. Is Privacy Badger selectively blocking third-party cookies behind the scenes, more than just what is clear in the panel?\nIt just occurred to me that lack of logged in functionality on custom domains is exactly what we see reported by users who have third-party cookies disabled (sorry for not mentioning sooner, it's been a while since I've been in that area of support). This is essentially a common pain in mapped-domain systems, as though I am visiting a custom domain, the necessary cookies are of course coming from WordPress.com. On the other hand, if I selectively enable everything related to \"wordpress.com\" in Privacy Badger, I still can't resolve the issue.\nI noticed in another issue that you mentioned https://www.eff.org/files/cookieblocklist.txt which includes the following line:\nwordpress.com^$third-party\nI'm not sure if that helps, but it did stand out, so I figured I'd mention it. Also odd is that our third-party cookie tool at http://en.support.wordpress.com/third-party-cookies/ reports \"Great, third party cookies are properly enabled in your browser!\"\nSorry, I'm rambling a bit, but I hope there's something useful in there for you. :)\nPlease let me know if you need more info or need me to pass anything along. We'd love to get this fixed! :)\n. Hm, that's odd. At http://en.support.wordpress.com/third-party-cookies/ I had wtptc.com set to green, and it wasn't a manual change (no arrow next to it). Maybe it's because I'm logged in to WordPress.com? wtptc.com is just the fake domain we load the third-party cookie from for the test, it doesn't do anything else.\n. Ah, ok. Let's ignore the test script then. :)\nIs there any more info I can get you to help figure out the custom domain issue?\n. Alright, I found the missing step, and a few other fun bits along the way. :)\nI went nuclear and completely uninstalled Firefox, including deleting profiles, then re-installed. I don't think that's really necessary, but I wanted to be sure. Here's how I reproduced it. I have also included a screencast below.\n1. Installed privacy badger from http://eff.org/privacybadger\n2. Logged into my WordPress.com account (I am using a test account not actually attached to the blogs in this scenario, like you.)\n3. Observed admin bar working on both http://en.blog.wordpress.com/ and a custom domain site.\n4. Quit and re-launch Firefox.\n5. Observed admin bar working on both http://en.blog.wordpress.com/ and a custom domain site.\n6. Go to a second custom domain site and observe admin bar working, but note that only now are some of the sliders not green.\n7. Quit and re-launch Firefox.\n8. Observed admin bar working at http://en.blog.wordpress.com/\n9. Go to custom domain sites and observe that now the admin bar is missing.\nIt would appear that you need to access more than one custom domain to trip the issue, perhaps PB gets confused by the two separate domains getting third-party cookies from the same location.\nI also included in the screencast my attempts to resolve the issue.\n1. Allowing all domains related to WordPress.com did not resolve the issue.\n2. Switching all sliders to green did not resolve the issue.\n3. Unblocking all trackers did resolve the issue, until I visited two custom WordPress.com domains again as detailed above.\nHere's the screencast: https://cloudup.com/is2IH9HWv_G\n. Thanks, having both fixed would be great! :)\n. The important one should be wordpress_logged_in always sent from domain .wordpress.com\nI'm also seeing some (not consistent) instances of wordpress_logged_in_random-stuff (where \"random-stuff\" is different each time encountered, though the cookie is not present on all sites), also sent from domain .wordpress.com\nI'll ask further up to see if I can get clarification on that.\n. Huh, that's really odd, great catch!\n. I've been thinking about this a bit tonight, and a solution to the core problem (not including the tracker display bug) might be to just add r-login.wordpress.com to Privacy Badger's whitelist (assuming there is a master whitelist).\nWe don't track anything through that domain. All it does is essentially get the logged in cookie when viewing a custom domain, to essentially trigger the logged in functionality.\nIf you are logged in, you probably want logged in functionality and thus r-login.wordpress.com anyway. If you aren't logged in, you won't pass through r-login.wordpress.com.\n. Yeah, it's been a long-standing \"issue\" that there really is no way around for us. The service is WordPress.com, but the domain is custom, so Firefox considers the logged-in cookies to be third-party. We have about 50 million sites currently at WordPress.com, and about 1.3 million of those have custom domains, it's a pain point for sure.\nIt's kind of like if Facebook or Twitter allowed you to have your profiles at a custom domain. You could view the profiles at the custom domain, but without allowing the third-party cookies from facebook.com or twitter.com, you wouldn't be able to interact with them.\nFor what it's worth, if you accept third-party cookies only \"from visited\", WordPress.com blogs on custom domains function as they should for logged in users.\nIs there anything we could do or provide besides just waiting for a domain whitelist so r-login.wordpress.com could be added to it? It sounds like a good solution, but if there's anything better, I'm willing to help or at least get someone better than myself to help. :)\n. Ah, brilliant! I'll pass that along, thanks!\n. Noting, more details and discussion at https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/116\n. I'm able to switch between Earth and Map view at https://www.google.com/maps/ without issue on Firefox 29.0.1 with Privacy Badger 0.1.3. In fact, Privacy Badger reports for me \"Could not detect any tracking cookies.\" at Google Maps (I do think that's a bit odd for Google).\nIn the new version of Google Maps, the terminology \"Satellite\" was replaced with \"Earth.\" If yours says \"Satellite,\" you might be stuck on the old version of Maps, and maybe that doesn't work with Privacy Badger.\nAccording to https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3045828 if you forced the old Google Maps at some point, you should be able to switch back to the new Google Maps via https://maps.google.com/maps/about/\n. Just a thought, but Privacy Badger shouldn't be necessary in private browsing mode, or in situations where you're clearing everything on close. Privacy Badger blocks tacking cookies, which are stored in your browser to relay (usually anonymous) identifying information, browsing history, and overall browsing trends.\nPrivate browsing mode blocks all cookies unless they are absolutely necessary for the session, and dumps any allowed cookies when you close the browser. If cookies are dumped when you close the browser (or blocked in the first place by private browsing mode), there is no data for them to track, and thus really no need to use Privacy Badger if you always use private browsing mode or automatically dump your cookies on close.\nAgain, just a thought, I'm sure it's a bug that the developers might want to fix regardless.\n. I don't have accounts with any of the sites you listed, so can't test for sure, but I'm not having any trouble staying logged in to the sites I use.\nAre you sure that you don't have Firefox set to \"Never Remember History\" or to keep cookies until \"I close Firefox\"? This is controlled via the Privacy section of the browser settings.\n. Which version of Firefox (including platform) and Privacy Badger are you using?\nUnder Firefox 29.0.1 Mac, Privacy Badger 0.1.3 actually looks great, especially compared to GreaseMonkey:\n\n. ",

I've activated my Privacy Badger 0.2 yesterday again and in the shell, there was some warning about a path ~/.cache/firefox/... missing. I did a mkdir -p to just create it and the warning was gone. Strangely, since then also I had no problems with Privacy Badger anymore. I'll check if the bug comes up again the next few days.

So I keep trying to cope with this and it still keeps breaking sites within a few days from resetting privacy badger settings.  Every time I do what I mentioned in previous comment. I'll write down what privacy badger has changed, then I'll go in and set the same exclusions on sites that I have problems with, and they still keep getting reset.  This constantly happens with both github and twitter, which are probably the main two sites I have whitelisted.  I can't think of any other sites where I tell it to keep login now that I think of it.  Well i guess the cookies that banks set to show that my browser is authorized will stay.  But it's not always happening.  For example I just reset it again, restarted firefox a couple times, went to sites like cnn and msnbc and other sites which I know would get privacy badger to start blocking things, restart again, and it's not happening.  It only happens after some period of time.\nDon't know what populates the list of exceptions but maybe if there was a way to add exceptions to that source list.  For example a way to tell privacy badger that no matter what to never touch *.twitter.com cookies.  I'm going to see if I disable for github and twitter if that fixes it.

I haven't tried many domains yet, but it definitely keeps happening on Facebook, Twitter, Youtube .. (I have not yet whitelisted their entire domains, because that would miss the point I guess. However I put their sliders to 'green')\nI would propose an option to turn off the intermediate level altogether. I.e. either completely block a tracker or leave it untouched.

    "LordDewi": "I believe this is related to Issue 113, https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/113\nI'm seeing the same issue with domains that are hosted on Squarespace. So far I've come across three of these. When I visit the actual domains there is no formatting. But when I visit the sub-domain on Squarespace the formatting is there. Additionally, when I disable Privacy Badger for the page on the actual domain the formatting is correct.  So my guess is that it's like issue 113 where the site is re-directed to the host, wordpress.com in that case.  I'm not sure why all formatting disappears in this case though. It's as if .css files and images are all being blocked, not just cookies.\nAttached are examples of just one of the sites that has no formatting, MaureenBad, and then with the formatting when either on the subdomain or with Privacy Badger disabled. These are for the domain maureenogle.com The subdomain on squarespace is maureen-ogle.squarespace.com\nThe other two domains that don't work unless Privacy Badger is disabled are\nbabyvamp-jessica.com\nmakinggameofthrones.com\nThose two are official HBO sites but in looking at the source code are hosted on Squarespace.\nFor the record, I do not own any of these domains so I can't do any testing. I have contacted Squarespace to report the problem, hopefully they will get in contact to try to correct the problem on their end.\nThere are, surprisingly, very few 3rd Party Trackers/Cookies listed in Privacy Badger but the common one is static.squarespace.com. If I manually move the slider in Privacy Badger to Yellow or Green then then page does display properly.\nI hope this helps.\n\n\n. @diracdeltas Yes, that may fix the problem. Unfortunately the bigger issue, for non-web people, is that they won't know which sites are squarespace.com sites. The sites I referenced in my post are just domains that I found were squarespace.com sites, after looking at the HTML code. A normal person would not know to look at the code, and even if they did might not realize it was the squarespace.com code that was causing the problem.\nBased on the original post it is more than one site that has problems. There seems to be some issue with the Privacy Badger plugin blocking more than just 3rd party cookies. If the formatting is considered cookies then the code of the plugin may need to look a little further into the HTML to see if it's an actual cookie or just formatting, such as this.\nOr, certain sites need to be automatically added to the cookieblocklist, or flagged Yellow, instead of red, so the formatting still shows.  I've also seen some sites show the Privacy Badger icon on specific parts of a page, such as AddThis plugins on sites, maybe that can be added to sites where it's not clear if it's a cookie or formatting.\n.

If you want something to be whitlisted because it's turning up as a false positive, create a bug report stating what exact URLs privacy badge should not be blocking.\n.

    "auxbuss": "I looked into this more closely today.\nIn one of my Firefox profiles that has SDC & PB active simultaneously, web-sites are being added to SDC's whitelist automatically simply by visiting a site. They are permanently added with the status: Allow first party only.\n\nAs soon as PB is disabled, this behaviour ceases, but the entries remain and persist between sessions.\nI created a new FF profile, first adding SDC, testing, then adding PB and testing, but could not recreate the behaviour. (Although, new empty entries were written to SDC's whitelist, but these did not persist between sessions.)\nIt seems bizarre to me -- a non-FF extension dev -- that SDC's whitelist is being updated simply by visiting web-sites. At first glance, that seems like malicious, targeted code, but since the additions are happening on major sites, e.g. Google, Wikipdeia, etc., that seems unlikely. The behaviour is definitely triggered by activating PB.\nI looked at SDC's code, briefly, but not being familiar with FF extensions, it didn't make much sense. That said, the string 'Allow first party only' is not present in the code, but then nor is 'Allow for session'. I'm interested to know where that comes from, so I may dig into the code again later.\nThe result of this problem is that all sites that send cookies are being automatically whitelisted in SDC, thus negating it purpose entirely. I actively encourage folk not to use SDC and PB simultaneously.\n. It's been a while, so I just installed Privacy Badger again.

    "SwartzCr": "@keybounce you might enjoy trying our new stable version which has this change implemented: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/tree/stable\nfeel free to reach out for help if you need help installing it, otherwise it'll be in the main version soon :)\n. I don't know how I feel about the policy of closing 2.0 milestone issues\n. It's likely that privacy badger is encountering an error when trying to save its heuristic data\nIf this happens again could you look at the console for the app (either by inspecting one of the dropdown windows, or looking at the 'backgroundpage.js' scope) and share what you see there?\nThat would be immensely helpful\n. Did you get a dialogue saying that privacy badger had crashed?\nThe next time this happens please try to see if there is info in your browser's console and attach it.\nI'm going to close this ticket, but please open a new one if this happens again and you have more information into the root cause\n. closing this issue, feel free to comment if you're still having problems\n. This looks great except for two minor issues\nI get two scroll bars, one for the whole popup and another for the blocked domains\nAdditionally tooltips are now these popups, but the lines between domains shine through the tooltip popup bubble, which is a bad look, I'm guessing this is a CSS thing?\n. added non-cookie setting domains to popup\nthey are under a fold which says that they don't set or read cookies\n. Looks good on my machine, and works as expected.\nIf you wanted to spend a bit more time on this, I'd be a happy clam if you could get the vertical space between the domain name and the mouseover tooltip to be smaller, right now there's about a 20px gap between them, which makes the whole popup look awkward just to accomodate any given tooltip\n. my guess is that maps.google.ca needs to be added to the cookieblocklist, though this brings up the question of what to do with other google tlds\n. a few issues:\nThe options page doesn't refresh as it gets new data, the chrome one works with event listeners that update it when data changes, I don't know if we have this ability in FF\nAdd a blank space at the bottom of the domain list so that tooltips that render off the screen aren't gross\ndomains that are user changed on the options page don't bring up the 'return domain control' check mark on the popup, this seems like a serious bug\n. that is a shame, though as you mentioned there's not much that we can be doing about it. Hopefully Privacy Badger is blocking their cookies as intended, and if you run into problems where the content is getting blocked of course you can manually move their slider to yellow, allowing requests but not allowing cookies.\nIf you do manage to get in touch with them, you should encourage them to honor EFFs DNT policy which would have privacy badger allow their requests and make sure that they are legally bound to handle the data they collect responsibly\n. looks to be working!\n. this error is occouring in iceweasel but not in the newest version of firefox for me, but it is breaking sites (see cnn.com for an example)\n. this might also be why the overlay is only triggering every other time you open the pop-up\n. looks like it works\n. boo I'm getting the double scrollbar again\n. lgtm\n. new version with merge conflicts resolved in #405 \n. what would you like to see in this styling?\n. looks sane\n. looks awesome!\n. yes this adds a DNT icon to DNT flagged domains, but there are two additional issues I noticed which I'll open up new tickets for\n. looks good, definately a help button\n. I'm guessing these problems will be fixed with the resolution of #206 ?\n. well I didn't notice it not working before, but it seems to still work\n. Okay, I've made changed that deal with port.emit\nI'm going to merge this and then push them\nThanks so much!\n. looking good!\n. There seem to be major problems with the pop-up\nsteps to reproduce:\ngo to cnn.com\nyellowlist a domain\nrefresh the page, watch as the badge number doesn't not increase monotonically\nnotice things like this happening where something is yellowlisted according to the settings, but isn't showing up yellowlisted on the pop-up for that page\n\n. okay, so for the most part this works, BUT I've noticed two issues:\n1) and I can't seem to repro it, but set a domain to yellow or red for the top level, then go to the site and see all of the subdomains yellow listed, then manually set one of them to userGreen. When I reverted control over it, it stayed green for some reason. My guess is that this stems from a problem with getOriginalAction in contentPolicy, which goes to canAccessCookies which checks prefs from network.cookie.cookieBehavior, which checks in FF settings what that domain is meant to do, but doesn't check if the parent domain is on a list. Confusing, I know, so maybe getOriginalAction should change its logic to just not check that and instead do a check of lists for parent and then the FF equivalent of heuristic like in chrome\n2) This one is up to you to debug, but go to a site like CNN (why do I always go to CNN) and then go to settings and yellowlist something like outbrain. Then go back to CNN and user green some of the outbrain domains. For me they stop appearing in the pop-up at all. When I had problem 1, they were able to set cookies and I saw cookies come up in the FF cookie list, here they aren't\nMy guess is this has to do with the fallback in canAccessCookies where it checks if there are cookies in the DB, and it's defaulting to blocking the cookies. Why they're not showing up in the popup I don't really know. Something tells me it's like bugging out somewhere?\nFeel free to call me with questions\n. Try it again, but set outbrain to red in options\nI don't have ABP installed\n. YES! BUT\nthen watch what happens when you mess with other settings\nSPECIFICALLY things stay yellowlisted\n\n. yeah, start here, but I think there's another level that matters:\n@@ -396,7 +396,14 @@ var Policy = exports.Policy = {\n         return (parentHost in storage.userRed);\n       }, true /*ignoreSelf*/);\n     }\n-    if (_isParentYellow() || _isParentRed()) {\n+    if (_isParentRed()){\n+      if (window) {\n+        emit(settingsMap, \"update-settings\", \"block\", window, host);\n+      }\n+      cookieUtils.clobberCookie(host);\n+      return true;\n+    }\n+    if (_isParentYellow() ) {\n       if (window) {\n         emit(settingsMap, \"update-settings\", \"cookieblock\", window, host);\n       }\n. issue 1:\n12321321.log.optimizely.com isn't blocked when optimizely.com is blocked\n\nissue 2:\nyellowlist a tld, green list it's subdomains, revert control of those sub domains, see that they don't return to yellowlist\n\n.

(wanna do standup?)\n. I am now getting an issue where things aren't reverting from yellow list :(\nIt looks to be happening every time\nto reproduce yellow list a tld, refesh the site, see them all yellow listed (with no user revert option), revert on the options page, refresh the other page and see that they're all still yellow listed, and stuck there in perpetuity\n. looks good\nonly small issue is that things that get yellowlisted for TLD don't get a revert icon on the pop-up\nI'm going to merge, and then work on fixing that in the eTLD fix\n. what is this change supposed to be doing?\n. maybe @Hainish wants to take a crack at this?\n. Yup, that one!\nIt's just funny seeing a whole page with the displayed part being like half the screen height.\nMaybe @taravancil would be up for taking a crack at this?

Perhaps some localStorage setting is in order\n. Hi @LimboSlam,\nwhay do you think prevents the 1.0 version of privacy badger from working in Pale Moon? And what is preventing you from forlking it from stable and maintaining a version with those two fixes? I'm curious, and would like to help, but it sounds like a manageable project for a fork if it's just these minor differences.\n. lgtm\n. lgtm\n. looks perfect! Again, thanks for all the great work\n. #457 is a different issue\nthis sort of issue is caused when something errors out while writing the HTML in the pop-up and all the things that get hidden/show get spewed to the page, thus the two badger heads.\nI heard some people complaining that it isn't working at all in firefox 39 (though it works in my version of 39.0)\nIt would be helpful, if you're experiencing this problem if you could open the developer console (ctrl+shift+j) and tell me if you see errors when you start up the browser or when you open up the Privacy Badger pop-up\n. additionally here's one on chrome:\n             id: 336\n           fqdn: www.wired.com\n            url: http://www.wired.com/2015/08/snapchat-iran-deal/\n          block: NULL\n    cookieblock: NULL\n       noaction: NULL\n      userblock: NULL\nusercookieblock: NULL\n   usernoaction: NULL\n        browser: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/44.0.2403.125 Safari/537.36\n        version: 2015.8.5.1\n     extensions: NULL\n           date: 2015-08-06 19:27:13\n        message: \n     notracking: NULL\n. I wonder if this has to do with the code that is checking to see if a third party is accessing the canvas that @ghostwords wrote\n. yup this happens when the first run indicator has't been removed by looking through the first run comic.\nAdditionally it might have to do with your screen resolution, can you tell em what your screen resolution is?\n. @nekromoff can you be more descriptive with what you mean by 'site list loader'?\n. haha, yeah this is a carryover from the chrome version I guess, will fix this in the next update\n. Hi @BobAlice000 \nhave you looked through the comic on the first run page? (click the ? in the pop-up to get to it)\nPrivacy Badger will only block a third party once it notices it on multiple sites. With a little more browsing those sliders should start moving to red and yellow. If you would like to create rules for whole sets of domains, you can set rules for specific origins (like google.com as opposed to apps.google.com) via the options page, simply click the gear on the pop-up to get there!\n. hi @cypherpunk \nhave you looked through the comic on the first run page?

We're working with AMO to get this signed, but until then you won't be able to install it in 42 (though maybe you are able to turn of signatures in about:config)\nwe hope to have a signed version soon to alleviate this problem\n. hmm maybe we should add wikia.nocookie.net to the greylist\n. Oh, this is probably happening because BBC.com gets resources from BBC.co.uk, which is a different domain. Can you let us know which third party domains Privacy Badger was blocking? Maybe we can add them to the graylist\n. Thanks for the headsup bbci.co.uk should be added to the cookieblock list I think!\n. addressing this here: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/pull/573\n. merged!\n. githubusercontent is on the cookie block list so I'd say this is a duplicate of #516\nI'm going to close this in favor of that, please feel free to continue to comment there\n. it looks like we're already allowing netdna-cdn, I'll add netdna-ssl\n. fixed here: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/pull/580\n. hmm can you confirm that it is not setting cookies or modifying localStorage?\nIf so, please give us the URL of this server, as well as three other domains where it might appear as a third party\nOne of two bugs might be happening with Privacy Badger, maybe\n1) it is marking non-tracking domains as tracking, or\n2) it is counting thing smultiple times from the same parent domain\n. interesting, can you open up the browser console (ctrl+shift+j) and tell me if you see any errors (lines that are red) when you do this?\n. Not sure if it's related but I noticed today that contentPolicy is using ._isPreloadedWhitelistRequest rather than  _heuristicCookieblocksRequest to see if something needs shouldn't be blocked\nThis seems wrong, but maybe calling _heuristicCookieblocksRequest is redundant because we're checking isUserYellowlist? just going to leave this here in case it's useful\n. yes it is possible to whitelist parent domains!\nJust go to the options page (the gear icon) and the subdomain should appear on the list of domains, set it to yellow or green and it should propogate to all subdomains\n. additionally it sounds like we should add ttvnw.net justin.tv and jtvnw.net to the cookieblocklist\n. I've opened a pr for the fixes in chrome (#569) which may seem weird, but the lists are shared between extensions\n. okay new PR: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/compare/master...issue_499\n. domains have been added to the list\n. so the issue is the blockage of maps.googleapis.com, which should be okay due to the @@||googleapis.com^$third-party\non line 1 of the cookieblocklist (though why there are other subdomains for googleapis.com on that list I'm not sure)\nThis is the second googleapis.com issue we've seen recently (see #516)\nWe are hoping to fix this, but it is an issue with cookieblocking in general\n. I'm actually going to close this in favor of #516, feel free to add any new information there\n(and thanks for being such a helpful bug reporter! but we've just got to fight the issue page clutter!)\n. I'm using debian mainstream, and I notice no slowdown on iceweasel 38.2.0 with PB 1.0.1, also no slowdown in firefox 39, or with an old version of iceweasel (31)\nIt sounds like some connection in PB is getting blocked!\nI'm going to close this issue, but if you can try it again and let us know if any errors show up in the browser console (ctrl+shift+j) feel free to re-open it\n. being addressed here: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/pull/572\n. merged\n. visual space is already a very contested resource\nI think this would go against our UI best practices, so I'm not in favor of this change\nI understand the concern, but I think this would lead to a lot of strain in people using privacy badger normally, and trying to introspect the third parties on any given site.\nI'm going to close this, you or @cooperq can re-open it if you can think of a reasonable way to fit them in without pushing other content off of the screen\n. The problem seems to be in lib/cookieUtils.js\nwhile we've refactored cookie blocking to work with the cookieDb rather than the Firefox cookies, the function being called is canAccessCookies, which has spurious execution.\nFirst if it gets called without a channel it uses the firefox cookie settings, then it sees if cookieDb has an entry for the origin, if it doesn't it once again falls back to Firefox cookie settings. Since none of these things check for rules for parent rules, subdomains of things with rules don't get checked\nThe proper workflow is likely to see if the 'location' has a rule, if it does then return that rule data, if not strip the first section of the domain out and check again. Repeat this until we get a rule or we're out of domain and then return false if no rule was generated.\n@cooperq I'm curious if there's a reason you left all of this firefox rule code in there\n.  I'm also really confused about whether cookieUtils.canAccess is returning a boolean, it seems to have values like this constant: const _ALLOW = Ci.nsICookiePermission.ACCESS_ALLOW;\nand then is using that later in if statements\n. okay\n1) the problem is confirmed not to be in lib/cookieUtils.js\n2) I can't reproduce this issue, as www.googleapis.com doesn't seem to be a source on hd-trailers.net\nThat said the function to look at would be _heuristicCookieBlocksRequest in lib/contentPolicy.js, and I will go look at that now\n. I;m going to table this until I can reproduce\n. I officially cannot reproduce this\nsteps to fail to reproduce:\n1) ensure that add-on debugging is enabled: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Add-on_Debugger\n2) open the addon debug console from the addon menu\n3) get simple-storage, type: x =loader.modules['resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/simple-storage.js'].exports.storage.preloads\n4) do something like: x[\"doubleclick.net\"] = \"third-party\" --- which will add it to the cookieblocklist\n5) load up your favorite trackers (for this I used cnn.com, nyt.com, gawker.com, buzzfeed.com)\n6) see that all subdomains of doubleclick.net, such as ad.doubleclick.net are now set to yellow and not blocked\n7) wipe privacy badger and see that these domains are typically blocked when seen\n. this is a classic problem where a country TLD is blocking the resource store which is using the origin country's tld\nsince they're coming from different domains PB thinks that it should be blocked\nBUT THE REAL QUESTION is why is it getting blocked when it's not being loaded from outside of craigslist.fi? since that's not going to be multiple domains, and I don't think changing subdomains should trigger this, this seems like more than just a site bug to me but possibly a bug in total PB workflow\n. can any of you confirm if it's possible to re-order these addons? maybe by dragging PB directly to the browser bar? That might solve this issue\n. no #497 wouldn't solve this. #497 removes all user overrides, the issue here is that between re-installs PB will have the same domains hueristic blocked. That is if you see a third party 3 times and it gets blocked by privacy badger, it will still be blocked if you re-install privacy badger, #497 would only revert it if you had done a user override, but won't reset it to green\n. I can't reproduce it, can you suggest some other domains that might load it or read/write a cookie for it?\n. oh sorry, I mean to say that if I block it I can confirm that images don't show up, but my privacy badger is correctly showing it as not setting cookies. If it is setting cookies and getting blocked as a result then I am in support of it being blocked\n. can you open your browser console (ctrl+shift+j) and let me know if any privacy badger related errors are appearing in there?\nI'm guessing some call is failing causing that number to not update, if you see any please copy/paste them here or take a screenshot and post them\n. this is an issue with the popup I think, I bet if you were to look in your options page you'd see them appear correctly as set to block\nI'm going to close this issue in favor of #492, please feel free to follow the conversation there\n. you may also notice that you can't right click at all on the privacy badger pop-up\nI'm going to guess that this is mozilla intended behavior, and possibly something you can 'fix' by editing your about:config\nI'm asking in irc.mozilla.org #jetpack and if I get back a response that this is our fault I'll re-open this issue but for now I'm going to close it\n. okay it seems that this is because xul pages don't have context menus by default, so we need to add the appropriate attributes to it to be able to have right clicks.\nsome information is here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/menupopup\nI'm going to re-open and mark this as a good volunteer task (maybe @taravancil wants to do more work with the pop-up?)\n. this might have to do with the canvas fingerprinting code @ghostwords wrote?\n. are you saying there is tooltip text that gets written without a visable object being shown? Can you show a screenshot of this?\n. I'm guessing this is because some CDN that they are using to serve their CSS is being blocked. Can you either take a screenshot of the privacy badger pop-up or list which things are set to red on the site so we can figure out which third party is causing this issue? Maybe f1g.fr?\n. netdna-ssl.com was just added to the cookieblock list, this should be fixed soon! see https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/pull/580 for more info\n. is prsmedia.fr blocked for you?\n(for me, in chrome, these aren't setting cookies)\n. I can't reproduce this, would you mind taking a screenshot of all the domains that PB has blocked?\n. (also that game looks cool)\n. oops I think you didn't properly attach your screenshot, mind trying again?\n. lgtm, if the tests are still failing post merge though, things should be fixed\n. looks good to me\n. looks good\n. looks like a minimal change and now all the tests are passing!\n. Two things:\nWhen testing I noticed that kinja.com got yellowlisted immediately on buzzfeed, which is strange since that's the only site that it should be loaded on.\nAlso do you think this would be a good opportunity for an added test to check that trackers get noticed when cookies are disabled in the browser?\n. okay, i'm in favor of merging as long as a bug is opened for the yellowlisting non-cross domain trackers\n. @cynthiatekwe It seems that this pull request has a lot of additional changes in it. You should make sure that your branch is up to date with the master branch before submitting a pull request. Additionally I would suggest doing your development on a branch of your fork, rather than in the master branch of your fork. For more contribution guidelines I'd suggest that you review: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/blob/contribution/doc/CONTRIBUTION-GUIDELINES.md\nAdditionally i'm a little concerned by two things. Your fork of project has unresolved merge conflict text in it (as evidenced by the <<<<< HEAD in your README file). Additionally it seems that this code change comes from https://github.com/chidelmun, can you explain this?\n. without a privacy policy from xooimage.com we'd be reluctant to add it to the yellowlist list. Instead you should go into the privacy badger options (click that gear icon) and set xooimage.com to yellow.\nThis is different than changing it on any one site since it will yellowlist the whole domain, rather than just a specific subdomain.\nFeel free to re-open this issue if you still run into trouble, but I think that should work for you :)\n. lgtm +1 to merge\n. lgtm\n. duplicate\n. can we just return this instead of let and then return?\n. do we really not need this? we're still referring to it later\n. duplicate?\n. can you explain or maybe put a comment in explaining this? (and the following lines)\nI'm not 100% what innerHTML and outerHTML is doing\n. when did this change? are there other places which it's broken?\n. ",

For migrating the data from the old extension to the web extension you may use the new hybrid extensions supported of Firefox 51: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Embedded_WebExtensions\nExamples: https://github.com/rpl/webextensions-examples/tree/examples/hybrid-addons-native-messaging/embedded-webextension-native-messaging\n. :+1: \n. See https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/358\n. Two scroll bars are really a bit strange. I think it should be only one scroll bar. And here in Firefox 39 on Windows 7 it also only displays one (the small one to scroll through the entries). Just note that I've already clicked on the orange message on the top, so it disappeared - maybe that's what is causing the second scroll bar.\nAnd please also note that while folding out the UI for a second (while it's loading I assume) it displays the big scrollbar too.\n. In my case it looks quite well. No overlapping and all buttons are in the correct line:\n\n(Only the scrollbar seems to be a bit too long at the top, because the \"scroll up\"-button isn't displayed.)\n. See https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/457\nI think it's better to keep this in one issue.\n. Well... why not just display nothing at all. So only if something is blocked there a number is displayed.\nOtherwise you're right the green is too bright.\n. I'd suggest reopening this issue as this behaviour should be fixed. I don't know on what addon site this can be fixed better, so I've opened an issue in the repo of the other addon https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/issues/47, but as it is also shown by https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/538 the Canvas Javascript injection used by Privacy Badger does not seem to be the best way to do this.\n. Do you really think that's an exact duplicate? I mean it has nothing to do with CSP and it's very close related to another add-on, so it is more a kind of incompatibility.\nSo e.g. this issue can also be resolved in https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/issues/47 while https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/538 is the general issue behind the concept here, whcih should stay open even if this issue here is solved.\n. This problem is fixed on the side of CanvasBlocker with v0.2.2.\nYou need to activate script whitelisting in this addon and add the following JSON snippet:\n[{\"url\": \"resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/loader/sandbox.js -> resource://jid1-mnnxcxisbpnsxq-eff-at-jetpack/data/fingerprinting.js\"}]\nNote that the developer of that addon accepts Pull Requests for adding a incompatibility warning in their addon, which may suggest the exclusion. So if anyone of the PrivacyBadger contributors wants to have a look this I think @kkapsner likes it.\nAdditionally/Alternatively you may also add this to the FAQ of PrivacyBadger or put this information somewhere else so users know they can use the addons together.\n. duplicate of https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/358\n. Maybe open a new issue for \"Badger, please tell me why?\"?\n. Works without any problems here. Up to 17 things are reported by Privacy Badger but most of them are only cookie-blocked and the few which are completely blocked don't break the site.\n. I can confirm this issue with Firefox 40.0.2 on Windows 7:\n\n. Yes now I have. And it works now.\nI have no idea what caused this...\n. Mozilla is going to depreciate XUL in the future, so implementing this like this is not a good idea IMO.\nMaybe the new WebExtensions, which are coming soon, could help more in this case.\nhttps://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/\n. > But it also seems like it would only very rarely be the case that a site does not allow itself to run javascript.\nYes this is rarely as most sites allow it, but that does not help if one site does not allow it.\n\nI don't even know how we can check that programatically. \n\nIf you can somehow read the headers sent by the website...\nBut why check it at all? \nI would rather move the javascript which is included there somehow out of the scope of the CSP or something like this - I mean there are plenty of other extensions which use javascript but do not inject it into the site in such a way that it causes CSP warnings. (at least as far as I know)\n. I doubt that it is needed for everything you listed.\nAnd yes of course you have a good reason, but it's also nice if add-ons are CSP-compliant.\nBecause CSP also has a report-uri directive which allows web admins to get reports of every violation of this CSP. And there are already enough add-ons which violate this and cause unnecessary reports.\nDon't let Privacy Badger be one of these too.\n. > My CSP looks like this: script-src 'self'\n\nAny errors seem to disappear if I add 'unsafe-inline' to script-src.\n\nIn this case that's different from the one at GitHub, because here the missing self is causing the errors.\nHowever are you sure that 'unsafe-inline' in the script-src is causing this? As on GitHub there is also no 'unsafe-inline' for script-src (only for style-src) and Firefox does not show any errors about this.\n\nI didn\u2019t test it, but this might also be a workaround for trackers to (partially) disable Privacy Badger :anguished:\n\nEhm, how?\nDo you mean trackers could maybe modify the JS after Privacy Badger injected it?\n. Just BTW:\n\nif a website owner doesn\u2019t like the idea of Privacy Badger blocking stuff, the website could disable inline JS\n\nThere must not even be such bad intention behind this. Disabling inline-JS is a thing very much suggested when setting up a CSP (which can do so), so it is not only that there are CSP warnings, but obviously this also disables the Canvas tracker identification on all sites which are so security-aware and use CSP in such a way.\n. Okay just saw this again after disabling PrivacyBadger per side on GitHub.\nInterestingly the wrong display is only at the site I where I just disabled it.\nSo all other sites show the tracker list correctly.\nBTW also the number near the icon is correctly shown on all sites.\n. duplicate of https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/358\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/469\n. What I saw was that especially the avatar subdomains are not yellowlisted (e.g. avatars0.githubapp.com, avatars3.githubapp.com). This - obviously - causes display problems with some avatars.\n. Interesting. Did not know that this is so unreproducible, because it happens all the time in my FF. (v41)\n\n. > can you also confirm that you have the latest version of privacy badger (1.0.3) \nYes, it shows \"1.0.3\" in about:addons.\n\nplease tell me what other privacy related settings you have turned on (cookies, no history, etc.) \n\nThe only special I can see is \"blocking third-party cookies\". Except of this, Firefox internal tracking protection (also turned on for browsing in non-private windows), DNT and other add-ons which may also block some assets I have nothing else.\n\nlooks like this is the same bug as #118 this is a top priority for me. \n\nI have no issues with cookies or logins, but I did not tested it on the sites mentioned in the issues (I also do not have accounts there).\n. >  @rugk do you also have self destructing cookies extension?\nNope. Only Firefox setting for not accepting third-party cookies.\nAnd BTW I do not see any google domains blocked here at GitHub.\n\n\nCan you both list the extensions you have installed?\n\nI already listed most of them: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/648#issuecomment-154219012\nAdditionally have NoScript, Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe), Adblock+ and Greasemonkey (with no scripts for github.com installed) installed, but all other ones really should not be important as they do not interfere with websites.\nfrom an older reply:\n\nsubdomains of github.com\n\nAlso note that most of the domains (the avatar domains at least) are subdomains of githubusercontent.com not github.com.\n. My latest screenshot shows the current state. It seems this URLs are detected but are not detected as tracking me.\n(Screenshot from this issue)\n. Just reinstalled PB from the EFF website and it seems this is fixed.\nHowever I expected PB 1.0.3 to be installed while the new version is also labelled with 1.0.2 in the add-on manager.\n. Okay, experienced the issue again (with the \"new\" version). So it's not fixed.\nAnd I'm still curious about this version number discrepancy.\n. I think with the new PB web extensions version, this likely won't matter anymore.. Can confirm this (with v1.0.3).\nWhen choosing the stylesheet options in the dev console it also shows me an error that a particular CSS file could not be loaded:\n\n. duplicate of https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/656\n. In the NoScript forum it was said this issue is a noscript issue. Therefore I am closing the issue here.\n. In my case there are no trackers on the new tab page.\nCan it be that on Mozillas addon page there is Google Analytics and PB just does not update the display when I switch to the \"plugins\" \"tab\" there e.g.?\n. > You don't happen to have multiprocess firefox turned on do you?\nNo. I am on stable. :smiley: \n. Currently I cannot reproduce it any more. Possibly because when testing https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/730 I somehow do not block Google Analytics anymore.\n. Okay, after I found the culprit of #730 I could enable the manual blocking of ssl.google-analytics.com. So after doing so I can see this being blocked again. And it also happens when all add-ons despite Privacy Badger are disabled.\nAnd yes it really only happens at about:addons. And it only happens when I first access \"Search addons\". When I switch to the addons list e.g. afterwards the Privacy Badger icon and popup stay the same. So it really seems as I thought before:\n\nPB just does not update the display when I switch to the \"plugins\" \"tab\" there e.g.?\n. I also wonder why PB does not display the loaded trackers on the about:addons AMO site. Because Google Analytics only shows up when I already set it to block as I explained before...\n. So here is a gif, which shows how I could reproduce it in a fresh profile:\ngithubtest-gif.zip\n\nBasically you first have to visit a site which loads ssl.google-analytics.com (e.g. http://addons.mozilla.org/) and manually block it. Afterwards load about:addons and then you can reproduce this issue.\nBut I am also very surprised that Google Analytics is not even displayed in the first place (also not with a green slider).\n. @cooperq If you need I could send you a ZIP of the Firefox profile I used to test this.\n. Wait, wait...\nI agree, but this still does not fix the issue.\nI'll quote the important part:\n\nAnd no I am not even at the page \"Search for addons\" - this also shows up on other pages (\"tabs\")\n\n&\n\nAnd yes it really only happens at about:addons. And it only happens when I first access \"Search addons\". When I switch to the addons list e.g. afterwards the Privacy Badger icon and popup stay the same. \n\n&\n\nPB just does not update the display when I switch to the \"plugins\" \"tab\" there e.g.?\n\nSo this display issue is still not fixed - please reopen this.\n. @Skyper1987 http://www.das-dass.de/ :wink: \nIf you don't want to change the things I noted by yourself, I could also create a Pull Request.\n. BTW you can comment inline when you want to discuss a specific comment of me.\n. > Do you see any errors in the privacy badger console or browser console?\n1. There is a PB console??\n2. No, there are no errors in the browser console.\n. Okay, so I found the culprit: It is again CanvasBlocker.\nWith it activated the options page reloads when I try to change the sliders.\nAnd yes I've set up addon debugging.\nBTW I don't think this issues are related.\n. githubtest-gif.zip\nThis is the same gif as in https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/issues/711, but at the end you can also see this issue happening.\nI discovered that it only happens when you use Ctrl+F to look (e.g.) for google. If you use PrivacyBadger's built-in search function this does not happen.\n. \ud83d\ude1f\nOkay... once again.\n1. Make sure you e.g. have ssl.google-analytics.com in your block list.\n2. Go to the settings page of PB.\n3. Use Ctrl+F to search for google\n4. Click on the slider of the found entry.\nYou'll see that the whole settings page reloads and it does not change the setting (or only does so on the second click).\n. And what behavior will PrivacyBadger adopt? Block or allow Disqus?\n. At first I would not add an article before \"Privacy Badger\". Privacy Badger is a proper name.\nI also don't know why it is still called \"alpha\" there.\n. \"here\" should be translated and not a this position of the sentence (as it is wrong in German).\n. \"dich zu verfolgen, verhindere ich das.\" (AFAIK)\n. \"\u00e4ndern m\u00f6chtest, klicke\" (AFAIK)\n. \"Danke, dass Du\"\n. \"Hilfe brauchen, kannst\"\n. \"weiter unten, um\" (AFAIK)\n. \"sagen, dass Du\"\n. \"Symbol, klickst\"\n. \"vielleicht, dass\"\n. @Skyper1987 said:\n\nBut I don't agree to your meaning about the article before the name \"Privacy Badger\". In my opinion we talk about \"the\" badger (der Privatsph\u00e4ren Dachs). \"Klicke hier um Dachs zu deaktivieren\". Sounds a bit wrong in my opinion.\n. Yes it sounds a bit weird in both ways, but as the text seems to be a \"personal\" introduction of the badger I think it is okay to say \"the\".\n. \n",

My understanding from reading the issues is that the Chrome extension is now compatible with WebExtensions. I think the hold up is that a data migration tool for upgrading from the old Firefox SDK version to the new WebExtension version has not been created. This was mentioned in a comment above and also in this comment: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/pull/845#issuecomment-221138613 but I haven't found any follow up to it in other issues in either the Firefox or Chrome issue trackers. I don't think the WebExtension version will be pushed to Mozilla until this is taken care of.\nIf you really wanted to do (and didn't care about keeping your old data), you could try building and signing the WebExtension version yourself.\nEDIT: I just tried this myself and it seemed to work fine. I cloned privacybadgerchrome, changed the gecko id in manifest.json, ran make xpi, and then uploaded the xpi to Mozilla for signing. After that, I could install it into the current version of Firefox and it seemed to be blocking trackers as normal. I had to force enable multiprocess (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis#Force_Enable) to get it to activate with Privacy Badger installed.\n. I'm not sure what the current status is, but I believe the relevant commits are here: https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox/commits/dataMigrate. As I said in my previous post on here, the Chrome version of Privacy Badger already works on Firefox (with e10s). The issue is providing a smooth upgrade that preserves user data.\n. Yeah, this issue could be closed because the version on AMO is now compatible with multiprocess Firefox. However, I think this repo has been deprecated because PrivacyBadger now uses the Chrome version for both Chrome and Firefox.. ",

If you click the Privacy Badger icon in the toolbar, a popup will appear. Click the gear in the upper right corner, and select \"Unblock all trackers\".

See #10.\n. > I do think it is worth adding a button to let the user clear all data, maybe we can also add a button that resets all trackers to privacy badger defaults.\nIs that not the function of the unblock all trackers button?\n. That's almost certainly not coming from Privacy Badger, it's on a page you are visiting. It is possible that the heuristics do not match it (or you have not visited enough sites for the heuristic algorithm to block it). Are you sure this only happens when Privacy Badger is installed?\n. True. I just created a pull request to fix #220, so at least no cookies will be added.\n. Whenever you start Privacy Badger, it starts a timer to check the DNT (Do Not Track) policies of all your blocked sites, every 24 hours. The full request is to host + /.well-known/dnt-policy.txt. If the privacy policy request matches this one exactly, it is determined that the site is no longer tracking the user. Perhaps there could be a feature to disable policy checking (or, preferably,  delay the amount of time between checks) for specific domains.\n. Yes, I know it happens more than once every 24 hours. I said \"it starts a timer\" to do it every 24 hours, but I forgot to add that it actually checks on startup as well.\n. I think at the very least there should be an option to disable it and manually recheck. It should also be mentioned in firstRun.html (if it isn't already).

    "ChrisAntaki": "@PiRSquared17 This happens more than every 24 hours, it happens every time Firefox is opened.\nLet's think about this. Every time Firefox is opened, Privacy Badger is initiating a connection to a long list of ad trackers & popular domains. What gets sent to each of these? The user's IP address, their user agent, and the timestamp of when they connected.\n. No worries. What do you think about the sending of IP, user agent, and timestamp to each of these services?\n. When people download this plugin, they probably don't want it to broadcast their time of usage, IP, and useragent to a long list of websites including all the big trackers.\nFor instance, a user specifically blocks scorecard research. They would expect the plugin to block all communication with that tracker. Instead, the plugin proactively sends them intelligence on the user.\nYou ask a good question too. Not to make your question too complex, but I'd like to add another follow up question. If a tracker did claim to abide by DNT, would there be reason to believe they earnestly weren't tracking you, either blatantly or through a loophole like lightly anonymized data?\n:alien: \n. Thanks for being open to feedback!\n\ncooperq:\nI don't think that this connection really sends that much intelligence to the blocked domain, other than the ip address and the fact that someone at that IP is running Privacy Badger, but again I can see where this could be a cause for concern for some users.\n\nThe requests also contain the user agent, which describes which OS you are using, its version, and Firefox's version. Additionally, the requests provide the time Firefox was opened. The time & user agent could be used together to build usage patterns per device.\n\nOne potential solution here is to have privacy badger check for the DNT policy on startup and then not check again for some random amount of time between 1 and 2 weeks.\n\nWould this still mean that every time Firefox was closed & opened, all the requests would be sent out? Perhaps Firefox's simple-storage API could be used to persist data & achieve the target durations?\n\nAnother possible solution is to have all DNT checks go through a proxy that EFF runs which would get updated at regular intervals. It's not actually clear to me which option here is the more privacy preserving one.\n\nPhoning home to EFF directly would be 100x less creepy :+1:.  Having an option to never phone home would be awesome too.\n\nOn one hand you are potentially letting advertisers know that someone at your IP is running privacy badger. On the other hand you are potentially letitng EFF know which trackers you block. What are your opinions on this?\n\nThanks for asking. As a user, I'd like to be able to block certain trackers, and then have those decisions persist. If my decision to block a tracker was undone because of privacy claims from the tracker itself, which aren't verifiable without access to their codebase, I would feel like the plugin contradicted itself and wasn't adding security.\n\npde:\nMy instinct is that it makes more sense to check at a time when you would be loading a resource from the domain, rather than at startup.\n\nThat would be a good idea. If a user blocks a domain specifically, never checking that domain's DNT again makes sense.\n. I like the title of #234, it encompasses the issue\n. Tracking companies are kind of like professional stalkers. They follow people around, take notes on all their interests, and then sell that to the highest bidder. This DNT feature seems like it knocks on their door, and asks \"Hey! I have this note on my back that says not to stalk me, you down to respect that?\".\nThen, whatever their answer is, they'll still be at all the same places, taking all the same notes. We're just hoping they'll tell us they are throwing the notes away.\nWhat if instead, the plugin walked up to EFF's door & knocked, then asked for updates on any new stalkers in town. Perhaps EFF could still tell the plugin about stalkers who claimed to respect notes on people's backs.\nThe plugin might ask the user if he/she would like to trust stalkers who claim to throw away notes on them.\n.

There is also\nan option to turn off DNT policy checking. Additionally we are discussing\nbuilding a proxy hosted at EFF which will notify the user about new DNT\npolicies and revocations of DNT policies. We will have to wait until we\nhave the resources to do this but I think that people having the option to\nopt out of the DNT policy check is a good start for now.

I downloaded it from eff.org. At the time, I was using the latest browser version Firefox 33.*, and the PB Toolbar Button failed to appear anywhere, so I removed PB. After reading your email today, I thought it would be prudent first to download PB again before I replied to you. Within the past 45 minutes, I downloaded PB Firefox 0.2.3 from eff.org.\nToday, the PB button instantly appeared in the Firefox Toolbar. I have attached a screen shot of the PB Firefox 0.2.3 Preferences window. I did not change any PB Firefox 0.2.3 Preference settings after I downloaded PB Firefox 0.2.3 today. I am unable to determine why the PB button appeared today, but did not appear the previous time I downloaded PB about 2 weeks ago. However, 2 weeks ago, I was using Firefox 33., which was the latest FF version at that time. Today, I am using FF 34.0 because the browser updated during the past several days from 33. to 34.0.\nIn my experience, the PB Toobar Button did not appear in FF 33.*, but it does appear in FF 34.0. The PB Toolbar Button appears to be functioning properly. I perceive no issues at this time. I do not know for certain why the PB Toolbar Button appeared today, but failed to appear around 2 weeks ago. I wonder if another Firefox extension might have had an effect that prevented the PB Toolbar Button from appearing around two weeks ago.\nIn case it might be useful, I have attached a screen shot of the Firefox installed extensions that are present in my browser. \nThank you for all of your efforts. Please let me know if you require any additional feedback.\nEric\nBelow: downloaded from eff.org within the past 45 minutes with these default Preferences\u2026\nBelow: The PB Toolbar Button  is present in the Firefox Toolbar.

FYI HTTPS Everywhere now appears on AMO if you link directly to it (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/), but not if you search for it, which I assume is because it's uploaded but not yet moderator approved. I believe the visibility rules in that regard may have changed recently? Weird that PB doesn't also appear in pre-moderated state.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. LGTM! Go ahead and merge after adding a comment.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Any way to make this CSS more readable? Maybe store in a separate file and load at runtime?\n. Remove commented code.\n. Is this really an error case? Also, is there a logging facility you should use instead?\n. Can you move this HTML into an external file?\n. Do we have a close icon available? If not, this might look a little nicer: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/d7/index.htm\n. Space after //\n. Spacing around i =0.\n. It seems like this part (removing the diagbox, removing the listeners) should be factored out into a common (possibly local) function.\n. Is there a cleaner way to get this, like an onfocus event, or a currently focused object reference?\n. You might be able to achieve this with the :focus CSS pseudo-class.\n. Usually you should not have to use !important, relying instead on order of rules or specificity to determine precedence. What's it needed for here?\n. Space after //\n. See getBrowserForChannel in HTTPS Everywhere, it may be helpful for this.\n. It sounds like this case is common + would cause issues enough to deserve a log message?\n. This is fine, no need to change, but you might enjoy the JS idiom \"!!status\" to coerce something to boolean.\n. Alignment incorrect (tabs)?\n. I think path.contains is overly generous here. You probably want something close to path.startsWith(name), but you might need to strip off http[s]:// from the beginning.\n. blag?\n. Remove commented code.\n. For my own edification: In Firefox, will require() run the same file multiple times if you call it multiple times? Also, is this still called the page-mod UI? I saw you had some code with the pageMod name commented out.\n. Wrong variable name in jsdoc.\n. Add jsdoc.\n. I'll not be a stickler about one-line if statements in general, but I think this one is long enough that it makes sense to put the return on its own line.\n. This doDependingOnIsPrivate function is rather odd in both name and function. Why does it take a callback? Is it expected to be async in future? If not, a more natural approach might be a function like getStorageForContext that returns a storage object.\n(Not a change for this review, just a drive-by comment)\n. This export style is inconsistent with the rest of the file, and with e.g. privateBrowsing.js. Probably best is to adopt local style and assign directly exports.syncPreloads = function() {...}.\nIn the long run if you decide to consolidate export styles, my personal favorite is to put all exports in a block at the end of the file, e.g.\nexports = {\n  syncPreloads: syncPreloads,\n  ...\n}\n. Yes, removing and leaving a TODO is good. You can put the code in the appropriate github issue if you want to keep it handy.\n. Oh, I get it now. Yes, good call. I just made a similar change in HTTPS Everywhere to not log about requests without a window. And it looks like we fail closed on such requests, so that's good.\n. It looks like this is a target for a synthetic click to get focus in the right place, is that right? If so, .focus() might work better than .click(). And you should comment both here and in the JS that focuses here to make clear what's up.\n. Probably not an error.\n. I think we can't be super-duper confident that url has :// in it somewhere (i.e. maybe we could get called with about:blank). I notice the call site has an nsIURI handy and turns it into a string with .spec. Maybe pass along the nsIURI? Then you should in theory be able to pull out host + port + path here more cleanly. Also, add JSDoc.\n. I think this is on the hot path for request processing. Is that right? If so, looping through even a small list of domainExceptionSites is probably inefficient. I would add a big TODO to optimize this bit (after profiling).\n. JSDoc\n. JSDoc\n. It looks like this only fetches backupDomainExceptionURL, never the real one from eff.org?\n. Should be @param {string} url A schemeless url to check.\n. English\n. @param {string}\n. It seems like these reloads are in the wrong place since they can get called multiple times when there are multiple whitelistDomains. Probably better to put outside the loop, if (msg.action !== 'not_now') { activeTab.reload() }\n. usually\n. Missing newline.\n. Style-wise, my preference for functions that take a function argument is like this (to mitigate the rightward march):\nreturn doDependingOnIsPrivate(\"domainExceptions\", function(store) {\n  if (!store[location.host]) { return false; }\n. Please comment about why this needs to be included.\n. The * here seems spurious.\n. Another JS idiom, if you like it, is !!storage['seenComic'].\n. Weird! That deserves a comment, I think.\n. ",

The reason I think it was a Firefox bug is because after I disabled Privacy Badger, another one of my addons was reportedly using 100MB RAM. The rest of the addons were tiny. After I disabled that 100MB addon, another one of the addons, which was previous tiny, was reported to use ~80MB RAM. I disabled that too and guess what, another previously tiny addon showed as using lots of RAM.

This means that a 1st Party (the website you visited) loaded the script for tracking data. This data is used to understand user engagement and is now a necessity in website development. (though of course it could be ran through a different service)\nGoogle Analytics is exempt, at least for now, because it is in fact a 1st Party Tracking service.\n@skorokithakis that is not what it means, any data could be shared between websites in fact some data is shared by default, such as Referrers. 3rd Party means that you chose to load some kind of script from a separate party (this is still 1st party) but that separate party decided to load more scripts that the website didn't choose to load.\nA = user | B = website you wanted to visit | GA = Google Analytics | 3P = 3rd Party Scripts\nIf A were to go to B and B decided to use GA then that is a 1st Party decision because A chose to go there and B chose to use GA. (both A and B are 1st Parties)\nIf A were to go to B and B decided to use GA and then GA decided to use another service (3P) then GA would still be 1st Party, thus allowed, but that service GA tried to load would be blocked because that would be 3rd Party.\n. @Osteri without some kind of usage tracking, websites will have no data in order to improve their content.

This was the only change made and strongly implies Privacy Badger was the cause.\nUnlike the original bug reporter I only have about 500 or so tabs but the behavior occurred even with only 50 or so tabs loaded and the rest not loaded (after restarting firefox I use the option to only load tabs when selected).  I am also using the default tab groups.

    "chris00001": "Interesting. So I went to checkout at a site that used cardinalcommerce and I didn't run into a problem. I first made a purchase using firefox + privacy badger (where privacy badger had the domain excluded from being blocked) and I saw the xxx.cardinalcommerce.com (which redirects back to the merchant so you hardly see it). \nIn any event in order to test this under vanilla conditions where privacy badger does block it I renamed my .mozilla/firefox configuration folder, started firefox, and installed the latest privacy badger.  This time however I didn't see the cardinalcommerce domain and didn't get stuck when I made another purchase from the same site (that is where I don't get redirected back to the merchants site- which then would normally show an invoice). \nSo ultimately I'm not sure if it doesn't do this every time or if something was fixed in privacy badger since I brought this issue up. \nI suspect the sub-domain specifically that is being blocked by privacy badger is:\n0eaf.cardinalcommerce.com\nI know for a fact the 2nd part of that is correct.

I think there is a lot to be said for \"block by default\" instead of annoying the user. The user has enough annoying things to worry about without needing to educate themselves on yet another privacy problem with the browsers.\n- This is a stupid feature of WebRTC that never should have been implemented.\n- Most people don't use WebRTC peer to peer anyway, and won't notice if WebRTC is \"fixed\".\n- This is why god created STUN servers, which solve this problem in a better way.\n. > Excuse my ignorance, but how does use of a STUN server prevent IP address revelation in a P2P protocol?\nSorry, I should not have said that. The precise problem here is actually caused by how the browser's handle stun servers: the browser reports to the stun server it's non-public IP addresses, which then javascript can query.\nSTUN servers are of course very useful for P2P, and typically don't result in any privacy problems because the STUN server is not typically aware of non-public IPs, afaik.\n. > Hiding the user's IP address isn't part of Privacy Badger's mission, except insofar as we can determine that an origin/IP is tracking the user and providing no functionality they expect, in which case Privacy Badger shuts down all communication with that origin.\nPrivacy Badger may have initially been conceived of focusing exclusively on blocking tracking parties, but the code now includes some sensible elements that modify the browser's behavior when that behavior risks unexpected leakage of potentially personally identifiable information (for example, blocking referrer for domains that are cookie blocked). PB also turns on 'do no track'.\nMaybe you don't want PB to be an extension that forces the browser into reasonable privacy-respecting behavior in general, but it seems like that horse has already left the stable. Alternately, perhaps there is need for a new extension called PrivacyHoneyBadger? (PrivacyHoneyBadger don't give a shit, it just blocks what it wants).\n. ",
    "gunesacar": "\nI looked at the changes in ublock re: this and asked @gorhill about it here, and the setting that @elijh pointed at appears to maybe just block IP leakage from webRTC without disabling it entirely, which could be a desired feature, modulo the concerns pointed out by @gorhill.\n\nFor Firefox, uBlock seems to toggle the media.peerconnection.enabled pref, which disables the RTCPeerConnection completely (i.e. you cannot use Firefox Hello or other cool P2P stuff).\n\n@elijh When you say \"private IP\" presumably you don't really mean a private IP like 192.168.0.0/16, but a public IP that the VPN was supposed to hide, right?\n\nI'm not sure what was really meant by @elijh, but the discovery of local IP addresses may serve as a fingerprint if the user has multiple network I/Fs. The demo at https://diafygi.github.io/webrtc-ips/ lists four local IP addresses for me (on Firefox), containing the ones that belong to virtual machines/LXC containers/Docker boxes I've installed previously.\n. I think this is expected behavior. We easily hit to the limits of the underlying floating point standard since the entropy estimation involves exponentiation.\nFor instance, a 250-character string with English lower-case letters [a-z] may contain Math.pow(26, 250) combinations.\n```\n\n\nconsole.log(Math.pow(26, 250))\nInfinity\n```\n\n\nThis shouldn't cause any problems though, since you can safely compare Infinity to other numbers, which is in our case LOCALSTORAGE_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD (33).\n```\n\n\nconsole.log(Infinity > 33)\ntrue\n```\n. Good catch! Apparently we undercount the supercookie prevalence by one.\n\n\nThe reason for this is we don't call recordPrevalence for the first occurrence of supercookie trackers. We record the prevalence in heuristicBlockingAccounting and we don't yet know whether this is a supercookie tracker or not while making the first HTTP request.\nI added a call to recordPrevalence when we first encounter a supercookie tracker.\nhttps://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/compare/master...gunesacar:issue726?expand=1 \nThe test passes with this change.\nThis issue applies to both Firefox and Chrome versions, if you like the Chrome fix I can send PR for Firefox too.\n.

The Privacy Badger website doesn't seem to know Pale Moon and so it gives some strange behavior (glitches, overlapping content/misconfiguration). This is do to our new GUID change, so I had to enable the Firefox compatible option in Pale Moon. Could this please be fixed, possibly.         \n. @SwartzCr, I'm not that good in coding/programing so I wouldn't be the right guy here. I'm more of the messenger boy, so I'll see if one of our add-on team devs can fix this issue, they should as they have forked HTTPS Everywhere. This was just a friendly question and so I will respect your decision here.  :)    \n. @cooperq: I'm not able to update it Pale Moon, is it still compatible with us? I did leave a commit early about this being an issue, please read #447. \nEDIT: should have read, \"Your copy of privacy badger will auto update later this week when we release 1.0\" more closely. But please get back to me.\n. I think some patches from AlexVallat (a member of the Ublock Team with good experience in the Firefox code) work may be the solution here? Also look at #447. Now I'm not a dev or very good in coding/programing so my info may be wrong. \nLink: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/264 and https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues/224 or to exact can be found here: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/compare/master...AlexVallat:gorhil-master\nNOTE: once there's a workable icon to go on, next it'll need to be tested with our beta version of Pale Moon (Pale Moon v26.0.0pb1 and pb2 of the Goanna engine) as there may be some compatibility issues with extensions that use the \"code paths based on platform versions.\" But this should be a minimal impact because we are planing on returning a \"compatibility version for historical reasons\" to make sure these extensions remain compatible with us. \n. Alright,  I found PB v2.6.1 on one of my other profiles, so I have been testing it out on Pale Moon v26.0.0pb1 portable and everything seems to be working ok, meaning it installed (had to disable automatic updates/checking and with compatibility checks disable in about:config), shows icon and all functions work as if it was on a normal/stable version of Firefox (v24.8.1 ESR and of course current versions too) and Pale Moon (v25.6.0). Now all we need is a fix for the current version of PB and then go on from there.  \n. @cooperq and @VeronicaGarcia: yes I have gave some info that I think might help, but is right info, I don't know. I also want to mention that I'm not dev (not good anyways), so please don't think I will be doing any patching of the sort, only as mention up above have I given the info that might fix this issue. \nThough if you look at #595, @cypherpunk seems to have some workable.  \n. Yes I can confirm this. Also, you should read this: https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=9361, so you know how to account and recognize Pale Moon v26.0.0/Goanna-based applications for your website or add-ons. Yeah last I check our new milestone was at 74% completion.\n. @cooperq and @cypherpunk: I'm not coder (a good one at that), but will this also work for Pale Moon v25.0+ as see only min version 26.0? \nOr does this not matter as long as Pale Moon GUID is the install.rdf?\n.

I have the same issue, except it doesn't even need to be switching tabs.  \"Privacy Badger detected 56 potential trackers on this page.\"  Upon reviewing the list it's cookies from every site I've visited in that tab and none of them are actually from the site I'm currently on.  Upon switching tabs to this page it drops to 2 but upon clicking it the number jumps to 56 and everything from the other tab is now showing up in the current one which has only visited github.\n. No errors related to privacy badger.  Restarting resolved it for now.  My guess is that it's a race condition or order of events that once it occurs the array is not emptied and simply gets all new items added to it.  The key for me is that when you open a new tab it gives the correct count, then upon clicking privacy badger to get the list, that is overwritten with the larger array and the count changes.\n. I gave up on PrivacyBadger.  It was breaking more than 50% of the sites I visit due to non-tracking cookies, the interface didn't provide enough useful information on what it was blocking to be able to fix it easily (basically a guessing game as to what might unbreak the site).  Mostly CSS/login scripts would break.

I just tested this in Google Chrome and it does not block the aforementioned IP address.\nHopefully this narrows it down for you; that the problem is only when using Firefox+Privacy Badger.\nGoogle Chrome+Privacy Badger works just fine.\n. Ok I think I understand now. I have tested on machine with different IP addresses other than that of the server(s) and it seems to work just fine, without tracking detection.\nUsing Tor (for example), works fine with normal Privacy Badger behavior.\n.

    "mpalmer": "I'm getting (reports of) the same behaviour: the domains cdn-business.discourse.org and avatars.discourse.org are being blocked for a user running PB Firefox (version is reported as, \"I don't know what version of privacy badger, but the addons page says last updated 4/21/2016, and no updates were found when I check.\"), but I'm not seeing any misbehaviour when using PB Chrome.  Neither of those domains (should be) sending any cookies, and I've verified that they're not sending cookies to me for a couple of URLs I checked.\nThere are hundreds of domains for which these two domains would be third parties; the report originally came from https://community.letsencrypt.org, but https://community.infinite-flight.com/, http://forum.choiceofgames.com/, and http://commons.commondreams.org/ also reference those two domains.  If you need more domains, just let me know.  I've got plenty.\nAs an aside, it would be really helpful in cases like this if there was a \"tell my why!\" button that I could guide people to use when they reported these problems (or that I could use when PB blocks something).  A straightforward \"The cookie (xyz) looks dodgy af\" style output would make it much easier to identify what's going on, from the user's perspective.  If that hasn't already been reported as a feature request, and it has any chance of getting up, let me know and I'll open a new issue on it.\n. @rugk before I did that, I wanted to get some indication of whether or not there was any hope of such a thing being implemented.  No point spending time clogging up the issue tracker if it's already been considered and rejected for some reason.\n. @cooperq, not sure why this was closed.  I'll open a separate issue on the \"tell me why this was blocked\", but the originally reported issue still remains: a site which does not track anything, and which as far as I can tell does not look like it's tracking anything, is being blocked by Privacy Badger.\n. It makes sense as far as it goes.  It would also explain why some users are seeing problems, while others aren't (presumably the users that are seeing problems have visited whatever subdomain is being marked as tracking).  That raises the question, though: how do I go about figuring out which subdomain PB actually does think is tracking?  We don't do any deliberate tracking on any Discourse subdomains, so it's not a matter of saying, \"oh yeah, it's probably this one over here that's throwing up a supercookie\".\n. Discourse itself uses local storage, and we do run some Discourse sites under discourse.org (meta.discourse.org, try.discourse.org), but those sites shouldn't, under normal circumstances, be a \"third party\" for anyone else's site.\nIt's a pity no log is kept of which subdomains were the offenders.  Is there a way (short of, presumably, uninstalling and reinstalling privacy badger itself) to \"reset\" a domain's status?  That at least would allow us to rule out the possibility that some tracking that used to be on avatars (done without our knowledge by the CDN we used to use) has caused PB to get itself in a permanent knicker-twist.  I don't see how it'd be working for me, and not for others, if that were the case, but I'm not one for thinking my assumptions are gospel.\n. I've only had reports of the problem, I haven't been able to reproduce it myself -- which would normally be concerning, but based on your description of some of PB's internals, it's not unknown for a site to be blocked for some people but not others.  The original reporter, @ian-kelling, has commented on this issue, so hopefully he'll be able to chime in with more details if you need them.\n. Just an FYI, we're seeing reports of this again: https://twitter.com/flobin/status/816726049748910080  Again, I'm not able to reproduce the problem myself.. Done.  Let's continue over there.. ",

I have no idea. It's a horrible user experience. Same goes for \"report this site is broken.\" Well, if a site won't work because it's got a bad implementation that won't work without tracking me, then it's not broken, it's appropriate blocked, so again, I have no idea when I should use that form.\n.

It also hosts user-uploaded images.\n\n\nIs the domain's privacy policy clear that it does not perform non-consensual tracking?\n\n\nMixed: the standard DNT policy is posted and adhered to by @discourse, but the cookies are being set by Cloudflare which does perform the tracking.\n\n\nIs there a reasonable self-hosted surrogate available that could replace the functionality of this domain (e.g. https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome/issues/400).\n\n\nNo, because the domain is serving the user-uploaded image files as well as the necessary scripts. This is not easily replaceable with local functionality.\n. The issue has been corrected on our side.\n\n@mpalmer\nSpeaking entirely for myself, I find Cloudflare's addition of a top-of-zone tracking cookie to be appalling behaviour. I thought they were one of the good guys, but this... not so much.\nI've made the necessary changes to have avatars.discourse.org served via an alternate CDN (MaxCDN). I've verified that the responses now come back with no cookies whatsoever. If anyone sees any issues, or even if the Privacy Badger problems don't abate, please respond in this topic.\n. \n",

We have such a massive eSecurity problem on this planet because there are a whole lot of people out there who don't even understand the problem, let alone what to do about it.  However if they get to the point where they actually try to use a security tool like Privacy Badger then that too should be as simple as possible to use and not require them to jump through hoops because, if it does, they will not only drop the tool but they will be less likely to try other measures to protect themselves.\n\n\nAnd using PB means, you already use at least a few more privacy tools\n\n\nI do.  And I qualify as a geek.  But even so I am up against the limits of my knowledge when it comes to eSecurity.  For instance, how do I know that my machine has not been taken over, that what I consider my machine is or is not a virtual machine running on my hardware but under control of whoever?  How do I know  that there is no funky logic in the chips in my machine which is sending everything I type to some hostile foreign power?

Currently looks very unlikely that we'll adopt it.\n. Perfectly understandable. We are in the same boat -- adding support for the WEAPI would add having to support yet another framework (which is certainly a lot more complex and time-consuming than any extension maintenance would be for an otherwise stable SDK, I think). If you stop supporting the SDK version, then one of our community members will have to fork it and maintain it from there on out.\nFor future reference when this happens, would it be OK for this maintainer to continue to carry the same name of the extension?\nI do hope that until such time as the WEAPI has landed in release versions, you will consider keeping an SDK version available for Pale Moon users as well as Firefox users, to get back on-topic for this issue.\n. @cooperq Thanks, I'll make a fork into our add-ons organization then and hope someone will pick it up!.

Ah, I do have third-party cookies disabled (and Flash is installed but click-to-play, which I can imagine having some effect on that). That makes sense. On further investigation, it also looks like the ads on my most visited sites are pulled from quite a variety of sources (I think the worst offender might have changed this a year or two ago), and I guess it wouldn't be too surprising if it just is taking that long to see certain trackers three times.

It's good to disable all other addons when debugging CPU problems.\nIf you're still seeing this issue, there's a Firefox debugging addon that lets you easily share performance data for cases like this. You can download the addon and learn about it here.\n. @sonicou Hi, I don't think these network requests are anything to worry about.\nIf you enable and open the browser toolbox, then install Privacy Badger, then look at the browser toolbox network tab, you'll see that the addon fetches some files from the EFF website. These are named cookieblocklist.txt, domain_exception_list.json, and dnt-policies.json, and contain just the sort of content you'd expect. You can examine the file contents in the browser toolbox (the 'response' tab in the right panel of the network tab), or copy and paste the URLs into your browser's address bar.\nHere's a screenshot from my browser toolbox:\n\nYou can also search the code for each of those file names to see how they're used. In particular, this comment and the following comment explain that those files are re-fetched daily and whenever Firefox starts up.\n. Cool, it sounds like you think weekly pings would be preferable. You could submit a PR to change the ping frequency, and see what feedback you get :-)\n. @sonicou @cooperq Hey, I might instead suggest: \"if it's been 24 hours since last check, then check on startup\".\nThere have historically been issues with Firefox users having very stale addons precisely because addon updating uses a \"once per day, if FF is open\" update model, and some users tend to be offline at the magic time.. hmm, or maybe, \"if it's been > 24 hours since last check, check on startup, otherwise check once a day, if online\". le sigh.

    "sonicou": "I'm sure they are needed and the intent is not malicious but thats actually not the point.\nHaving a browser extension start a network connection every time the application is started is a very bad design choice and also leaks the information about this extension being installed to anyone listening on the network. There is no reason to do that. Having a 24 hour fetch or rather a weekly update is usually more then enought and practiced by many other apps that take privacy seriously.\n. Great idea. Just did that.\nI believe this should solve the issue: #819 \n. It was not my intent to do the update after having the app run for 24 hours, but I assumed that this would still trigger 24 or 48 hours after the last check.\nSome people open and close their browser hunderts of times a day and every time badger connects to the eff servers. That is not appropriate for a privacy app.. ",
