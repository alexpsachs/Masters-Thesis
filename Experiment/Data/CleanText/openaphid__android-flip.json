    "openaphid": "Do you want to layout images and texts like Flipboard does?\nI'm afraid FlipView can't help on that. The library is created  for the animation effect only.\n. I'm a bit confused. \nDo you mean that the flip animation doesn't work when you use both TextView and ImageView? Or you're looking for a better solution to display mixed texts and images?\n. No further input for one week. Close it.\n. I'm afraid that I can't reproduce the issue. Maybe I miss the point.\nDuring my test, the page didn't fall over automatically as long as my finger didn't leave the screen.\n. Now I got it.\nA velocity tracker is required to detect it. We'll add the support later with the event listener too.\nThanks\n. @iPaulPro Thanks for your contribution.\n@VAdaihiep A new issue is created to address the problem you have.\n. @VAdaihiep Please try the updated APK to see if it fixes the issue: https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/blob/develop/FlipView/Demo/APK/Aphid-FlipView-Demo.apk\nAnd you could follow it up in issue #17\n. - ActionBar issue\nFlipViewController view provides some important information for the animation: the dimension and the screenshot. Since  the dimension is controlled by layout managers on Android, FlipViewController is designed as a special container to take actions during the rendering process of layout managers.\nIt would be tricky to provide APIs for including outside content in the animation. My suggestion is to use it inside the controller, and reuse it in your adapter implementation.\n- Yes, an event listener mechanism is missing. We will add it soon. Thanks for the advice.\n. FlipViewController.sideBufferSize is designed to control the number of preloaded pages. The default value is 1, which means 1 previous page, the current page and 1 next page are loaded after flipping to a page. \nUnfortunately in your scenario, the lazily loaded content may not be visible during animation as the screenshot of the page was took before they're ready.\nI think we may need an API to notify FlipViewController to update the screenshot on demand.\n. @murimons I implemented a rough solution. The key idea is to use FlipViewController.refreshPage(View pageView) to make the animation reload content of an updated page.\nThe codes are developed in a new branch: feature/api-content-update\nPlease let me know if it meets your requirement. I'll merge it back to the main branch later\n. Two new methods are added to support refreshing a page manually:\nFlipViewController.refreshPage(View pageView)\nFlipViewController.refreshPage(int pageIndex)\n. An active page is the one of which content is involved in animation. You can treat the current page and its next one be the active pages as both of them are needed to render the animation.\nThe refreshing routine is no more heavier than manually flipping page. It triggers the following operations for the active pages:\n1. Makes the page draw in a bitmap in the UI thread to get a screenshot. (The memory consumed is corresponding to the size of the page, but normally it would be fine and it doesn't trigger large GC pause as bitmap doesn't store data in VM heap.)\n2. Binds the bitmap to an OpenGL texture in GL thread, and recycles it.\nThe first step is \"heavy\" as it asks the page to re-draw itself, which could be a bit slow for a very complex view hierarchy. \nMy suggestion in the doc is a note for the potential cost. For example, if you are rendering a view animation in a page, then it better not to call refreshPage() for each frame of the animation.\n. The native memory occupied by bitmap instances can lead to OOM as the VM budget is constrained by the sum of heap memory and native memory.\nPlease check out gclog.py if you want to check the real memory usage of your app.\n. I'll try to get a Samsung device to reproduce the issue.\nCould you tell me the OS version on your devices?\nThanks\n. I tested on emulator running OS 4.1 with high resolution settings (720 x 1280), but I failed to reproduce it.\nIt doesn't sound like a memory issue as far as I can tell from the video. But I could be wrong on this.\nI'll ask my friends for a Galaxy Note for further testing.\nBy the way, could you try to pause and resume the activity to see what happens then, by pressing the Home button?\n. Thanks for the detailed report.  The GC logs are fine for this scenario. \nI guess the bug could be caused by some incorrect OpenGL renderer settings for the high resolution. I'll dig into it for more clues\n. I'm still struggling to reproduce the bug. I went to a Samsung store and tried a GS3 and a Galaxy Note II with the demo app, but found nothing abnormal.\nOne user suggested that the problem is easy to reproduce for certain layout hierarchy. If anyone knows a layout pattern for this issue, please share it to us. Thanks for advance.\n. @cagkanciloglu \nI setup an activity to implement the layout that is supposed to cause issues. Unfortunately, it still runs fine on my new Nexus 7, old Defy+ and emulator.\n. @cagkanciloglu Thanks. It would be the best way for me to fix the issue.\n. Sorry for my late reply. \nIt seems that FlipView doesn't work well with async content. I'll try to figure out a way to improve it in develop branch first\n. @KyungHo if you met the same problem as @cagkanciloglu showed in  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv0pLLCn-8w . I doubt it could be caused by the OpenGL lighting setup in FlipView. But it's hard for me to debug it as it can't be reproduced on my devices (Defy+ and Nexus 7)\n@cagkanciloglu the issue you found in your followup video. It's actually a new issue, which will be resolved by fixing #37 and #28 \n. @cagkanciloglu I migrated your project into the demo app as \"Issue #5\". I found that its async loading logic is not 100% correct. Please refer to the comments in my commit for more details: https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/blob/bef17096d3eef18f412916b3c928ca81438c498f/FlipView/Demo/src/com/aphidmobile/flip/demo/issue5/GalleryFlipItem.java\nYou can also download the updated APK: https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/blob/develop/FlipView/Demo/APK/Aphid-FlipView-Demo.apk\nBTW: I also found the layout hierarchy is not optimal, you can try to improve it if it's used in your real app. \n. @ZoserLock Thanks a lot. I will merge it into master branch later.\n. I've pushed a fix into develop branch. \nCould you guys test it on a Galaxy S3 for me please? APK: https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/tree/develop/FlipView/Demo/APK\nBut I still don't get the real reason of the issue. If eyeZ is larger than 2500, zFar should be correctly set to eyeZ by Math.max, which is the case on my Nexus 7. Maybe it's caused by a math rounding issue on certain OpenGL drivers.\n. The full white issue seems not related to async content. Please share your code that can reproduce the problem. \nIs it reproducible on emulator? And what happens if you hold the page when it's full white?\n. I'm afraid the code snippet you shared is not compilable on my side due to its dependencies. \nMay I ask why you mixed a RelativeLayout and a LinearLayout inside a FrameLayout? This seems incorrect to me as FrameLayout only displays a single child view.\n. I only used FrameLayout to display one item at a time as suggested in its document. I didn't know that it can also be used to display multiple children.\nThe things failed to compile at my side:\n1. How do you setup ImageDownloader?\n2. There is no getTargetPlace() method for GalleryPage \n3. MekanDetailActivity is unresolvable\nApparently pasting codes in comments is not an efficient way to communicate, is it possible to make a minimal app or to add the case into the demos project?\n. @alexmedearis\nI also found a minor issue about the incorrect rendering of shadow in horizontal mode.\nPlease refer to issue #7 for more details.\nThanks for your contribution!\n. Actually there is a delay of switching the visibilities of the actual page and the OpenGL animation. But I'm not sure it's the delay you mentioned in your first post.\nDo you mean that the actual page doesn't become visible correctly after the end of animation? Thus any button in it doesn't work?\n. Is it possible to submit a minimal case to demonstrate the issue?\n. Will reopen it if we get more information\n. I re-produced this bug, will submit a fix soon\n. The current implementation is simply using a gray rectangle, and its alpha value changes according to the flipping angle.\nIt seems Flipboard utilizes the same mechanism too.\nI'm afraid I don't have enough time to work on this subject. I would appreciate if someone can contribute and share.\n. I have no idea what setIndexLayoutView is. \nPlease try FlipViewController.refreshPage if you want to keep the animated content consistent with your reloaded layout. FlipAsyncContentActivity demonstrates how to use it in practice.\n. Close it as no more inputs for several days\n. I've merged the pull request. Thanks\n. @VAdaihiep I fixed #16 which may cause incorrect order during flipping. \nPlease try the demo APK in develop branch: https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/blob/develop/FlipView/Demo/APK/Aphid-FlipView-Demo.apk \n. Fixed in the develop branch\n. Fixed in the develop branch.\n. The issue seems be fixed to me with the new update in develop branch\n. @iPaulPro Thanks. I'll re-check it today\n. @iPaulPro I can easily reproduce it in landscape mode. I'm working on a fix for it.\n. The issue occurs in some edge conditions. I tweaked the code a little bit to rule it out. Please try the latest APK in develop branch.\nI must admit that the logic in FlipCards is messy since I added bouncing support. It becomes tricky to handle states and actions between UI thread and GL thread. Maybe we should rewrite it in a future version.\n. Looks like a spamming request\n. I'm not sure what you problem could be. So I added a demo which embeds FlipViewController in a fragment, but it works fine to me. \nPlease provid more information about the issue you met.\n. Yes. It's a bug. Thanks for reporting it.\n. I finished a small patch to work around the issue.\nI'm actually not fully satisfied with the fix. I re-observed the behavior of FlipBoard, and I believe a velocity tracker is used to detect fling gesture.\n. Thanks for your detailed explanation.\nFrom my observation, fling behavior of Flipboard are different on IOS and android. There is no velocity detection on iOS but its android version may utilize one.\nFor example, I can slowly scroll a page up in Fipboard android; it goes back as long as the scrolling angle is less than 90 degree.\n. I'm using 1.9.10, 221\nFlipview will go with your  solution as using velocity tracker adds code complexity without significant UX improvement.\n. FlipView needs to capture screenshots of the current page and the next page for the animation while flipping.\nThe screenshots are kept as bitmaps in the main thread for a while, until they're binded to OpenGL textures in GL thread.\nOOM errors are expected to happen when there is not enough memory left in your app process for the bitmaps. \nI'm considering about adding a fail-safe strategy in a future version, which turns to use a placeholder texture when OOM error throws.\n. After a discussion in #20, I decided to not implement unless there is a strong request\n. The issue is about to reduce the risk, not to avoid it.\nI analyzed the heap status after flipping 100+ pages. There is no bitmap instances or other objects leaking. Then I thought OOM is caused by the behavior of adapter.\nPlease refer to #33, I will push a fix in a minute \n. Leave it close as the memory leak has been identified in #33\n. Please refer to #33\n. Lower the priority of this issue since the memory leak is caused by incorrect handling of adapter in FlipView\n. Please check out and tweak FlipCards.draw() method, especially the branch of STATE_AUTO_ROTATE. It's the logic which handles the automatic flipping after end of touch event.\nI personally prefer the current acceleration way. It feels more realistic.\n. This issue is a bit related to #29, but it's actually not a bug of FlipView. \nWhen bouncing ends, FlipView invokes setSelection(), which finally makes the adapter to get a view.\nThe line inside getView() is the root cause of the visual glitch:\njava\nFlipAsyncContentActivity.getImageManager().getLoader().load(photoView);\nIn order to prove my point, I made a minimal app, in which the ImageView always displays the default image first and then switches to the actual image.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/y4mudczmjz9smrr/Issue27_ImageLoaderTest.zip\nImageLoader is only used in FlipView demo app for demonstration purpose. I'm not familiar with its APIs. I will replace it with other lightweight solutions.\n. Would you mind make a sample to demonstrate the issue?\n. Do you correctly invoke FlipViewController.onResume() and FlipViewController.onPause() during the fragment lifecycle?\nAnd BTW, please refer to my original post: http://openaphid.github.com/blog/2012/09/21/aphid-flipview-for-android-v0-dot-9-beta-released/ ; it's recommended NOT to use multiple FlipViewControllers in one activity.\n. Works in the new test\n. I'm afraid it's not supported\n. #33 fixes a memory leak issue, which could be relevant to your problem.\n. I think commit c187a822e557c15de943da8bb955d6584f09058f may have fix it.\n. Fixed in the develop branch\n. Which branch are you working with? Develop or Master?\nYour first problem seems to be an issue which has been fixed in develop branch.\nI don't fully understand your second problem, do you mean that you can't add header and footer with FlipViewController? \n. I tried to place FlipView with a header and a footer inside a LinearLayout. It works fine to me.\n\nI'm afraid I need more information about the size issue. It's better to have a minimal layout/activity code which can reproduce the issue.\nUse git checkout develop to switch to the develop branch\n. This project only replicates a small part of Flipboard, and I'm afraid I can't guarantee it can fit into all scenarios since I finished it for fun during my trips.\nA Flipboard quality app would take a lot of time. For example, Flipboard Android and its table version both cost over 1 year separately.\nAnd by the way, I didn't find your code attached. Maybe you replied to this issue list in an email.\n. Please check out the last update in develop branch. It's much better for pages with async content\n. I created a new issue (#41) to address the problem. \nThe behavior in previous version just happens to be correct.\n. #41 has been fixed\n. Doesn't refreshPage() meet your requirement?\nI also added FlipViewController.refreshAllPages() in the last commit in develop branch.\n. Thanks for your interest on this library.\nI pushed several important changes into develop branch these days, in which the control logic has been rewritten to a cleaner style and also fix some critical issues about memory leaks.\nIf you would like to try the new version, I suggest you start with these code points:\n- FlipCards.handlerTouchEvent, case ACTION_MOVE. Use the code below to force reloading. I think it's a better place than ACTION_DOWN. But I'm a bit worried about the performance after this change.\njava\nif (Math.abs(delta) > controller.getTouchSlop()) {\n    setState(STATE_TOUCH);\n    controller.refreshAllPages(); //force reloading\n    forward = delta > 0;\n}\n- Modify ViewDualCards.java to reuse bitmap. For example, you can simply modify recycleScreenshot() method to store the bitmap in another field, and reuse it later.\n. Thanks a lot!\n. A new demo FlipDynamicAdapterActivity has been added to illustrate the details.\n. I manually merged your contribution as the automatic merge doesn't work\nThanks\n. @siegfriedpammer 2622d34 is not 100% correct. I've revert it back. Please refer to https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/issues/46#issuecomment-12357236 for more details\n. A demo has been added in develop branch. Please do read the comments in FlipWebViewActivity before you use it in your app: https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/blob/develop/FlipView/Demo/src/com/aphidmobile/flip/demo/FlipWebViewActivity.java\nAPK: https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/tree/develop/FlipView/Demo/APK\n. Do you want to manually switch to a certain page? Please use setAdapter(adapter, initialPosition) or setSelection(int pageIndex)\n. I'm unclear about your meaning. Do you want to disable the bouncing behavior at the first and last pages?\n. Added FlipViewController.setOverFlipEnabled in the develop branch\n. Another push caused the issue, I've revert it back. Sorry about that.\n. setOverFlipEnabled should work fine without being affected\n. @zhein04 it should have been fixed in such edge case\n. I have no idea what it is for. Close first\n. The design of FlipView follows the general principles of AdapterView; it has no knowledge about the view hierarchy provided by an adapter. The only thing that is cached and reused is the convertView passing throught the method getView(...).\nIt's up to you to cache image resources and reuse them in your adapter, like what you can do with a ListView.\n. FlipView relies on surfaceView.setZOrderOnTop(true); to make the gl view transparent, this line also makes any overlay views invisible during animation.\nI'm afraid you have to change your UI design.\n. please use adapter.notifyDataSetChanged() as what you can do with a ListView\n. I've added a demo to delete a page from option menu. adapter.notifyDataSetChanged() worked as I expected.\nPlease install the APK file to check it out. https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/blob/2c3308fddf6fbb532565ea4505164d1852c4953d/FlipView/Demo/APK/Aphid-FlipView-Demo.apk\n. I created a simple demo to address your issue, but I can't re-produce the problem. If you think it's caused by specific layouts, please try to submit a pull request to help me debug it.\n. The best approach is to make FlipView support getViewTypeCount() and cache views according to their view types.  But I'm afraid I'm not available to make it real in these days\n. I was lazy and used a naive mechanism to start animation in showFlipAnimation() of FlipViewController.\nhttps://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/blob/master/FlipView/FlipLibrary/src/com/aphidmobile/flip/FlipViewController.java#L497\nFlickers happen when 100ms is not enough for the controller to build animations.\nI will try to solve it as it seems like a simple fix.\n. I've pushed a change in develop branch. I won't claim it can eliminate flicker entirely, but please let me know if it helps reduce flashing in your app.\n. Reopened, will push a fix in develop branch soon\n. The push 2dca94e should have fix the flash issue, but it also introduces a minor issue when flip backward on the first page. I'll publish a fix later today.\n. Thanks for your report, it seems my previous fix is not perfect yet.\n. I've finished another fix in the develop branch to address the issue. Please try it on your device.\nThanks in advance.\n. I acknowledge your concern, but the initial design was to minimize dependencies. Since PagerAdapter was ruled out as it's a part of Android support library. \nAnd other Android UI widgets go with the same strategy too, i.e. https://github.com/pakerfeldt/android-viewflow\nIt's possible to add PagerAdapter support, but I'm afraid I'm not available for this task in these days. (Blog post)\n. The patch above should fix it.\n. Around https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/blob/master/FlipView/Demo/src/com/aphidmobile/flip/demo/adapter/TravelAdapter.java#L69\n. The easy approach is to play a trick in your adapter.\n1. Make the adapter return a very large data size, for instance, return actual_data_size * 1024\n2. Set the initial selection position to the middle position of the virtual data set\n. I also found out that flipping in Flipboard could also be over sensitive.\nI'll try to improve it later\n. There is no constraint on the content of your layout for a page. You can use multiple buttons according to your design.\n. Duplication of #52 \n. Invalid request\n. Could you please set up a minimal case to illustrate the issue? It would be better to submit it as a pull request into the demo app.\n. sorry for my late response. I'm working on it right now.\n. I've looked into your sample project. It seems it's not using the latest version(v0.9.8) of FlipView.\nI tried to upgrade it with v0.9.8 and I failed to notice anything abnormal except issue #66\n. We should keep the old texture for rendering until the new texture is ready. I'll fix it in next version\n. duplicate of #68 \n. Don't worry. It's already been closed.\n. seems spam to me\n. spam\n. How about changing it to FlipViewController(Context context, int orientation)? The valid values of orientation could be the constants you've already declared.\n. ",
    "xuantunga2": "Yes, i do. My app is simple, it's layout don't  complicate as flipboard . I use TextView and ImageView for display content. With content has text only, i can resolved , but content has text and image together i can't. have you any idea? thanks!\n. ",
    "quintos": "No, what i meant is, the ability to \"fling\" it. (Flinging being that a animation continues at a degrading speed (or the same) after the finger is released. or something like that..)\nThis is the experience in the Flipboard implementation:\nI fling it up or down but release it before it reaches the middle. And because of the speed/momentum it crosses the middle and falls over without my finger attached. (This is how it's perceived)\nWhat i'm experiencing with your implementation is,  if i release my finger before the page reaches the middle, it will always fall back. I need to keep my finger attached until it over the middle. In other words i need to take it over the middle with my finger and i can not fling it over the middle.\nI don;t know if you have Flipboard available to have a look but you'll notice that you can give pages a very small push and that will still trigger the page to flip over by itself.\nIs this not how you experience it?\n. cool\n. Indeed.\nDo you think you can make it re-use Bitmaps?\n. Excelent!\nThis meets my requirement indeed!\nquestion:\nIn the docs you say that for an active page this would be an expensive operation. Do you mean a page that is being viewed at that moment or flipped? So when i flip to a page which is still in the middle of lazy loading my image and when that finishes (and i'm still looking at it) , i refresh the screenshot, this would be a heavy operation? in terms of memory?\nthanks!\n. I understood that It doesn't store pixels in the heap but the Bitmap memory does get accounted against the heap.  So if a refresh allocates a native Bitmap it also uses up the memory in the Java heap. But GC could still be fast because the Bitmap object in the heap is small. (Is GC speed related to  object size?)\nI'm still having issues with Bitmaps in my app causing OOM exceptions because of this (Not related to android-flip). I'm now trying to find a way to re-use Bitmap objects.\n. Update:\nI'm not sure if the delay i spoke about in my first post is the actual View being shown or an updated version of the screenshot. But it seems now pages are always showing the screenshot in stead of the actual View  (I know because i see a progressbar not moving). This is going to be a problem when i want to put buttons in my Views.\nbtw, i'm also refreshing the screenhots on demand here.\nthnx\n. Yes, that what i mean. I have not tested with a button yet to see in the button works (will do tonight) but what i'm seeing right now is this:\nWhen i flip over to a certain page i'm seeing my image and below it my progressbar (which is not moving). So this is the snapshot being taken on demand after my image finished loading (the progressbar is not hidden afterwards). I release the page and the page stays the same. When i move this page again the screenshot during the animation is still this same page with the stationary progressbar (spinner).\nso whether i'm moving the page and watch the animation or after i release it. In both cases i see the exact same page with the progressbar at the same position. So my conclusion is that i'm looking at the same screenshot in the animation and when i'm not in the animation. And i would expect that after the animation, the actual page must be visible in which case the progressbar should be spinning\n. I also have Views which i don't refresh on demand (different layout) at this time and with this i'm seeing this:\n- I flip to a page and i see my spinner spinning and then my image appears. The View is fully loaded now.\n- When i move the page, i see the animation with only my spinner (no image) because i did not refresh the page on demand after the image got loaded.\n- Now when i flip it a bit and release before i flipped it fully, the page it still showing the animation image (with just the progressbar ,not moving)\n- after if flip 100% over and come back, everything shows the full page incl image because now the snapshot has been updated (i assume) which now includes the image but i could still be looking at the screenshot but i don't know (because this view does't leave the progressbar visible. But i''ll test it with a button)\n. This is what i'm seeing:\nwhen the page is refreshed (the screenshot) after i flipped to it (after my lazy content is loaded), it will flicker when i flip it over to the next page. When the page has already done it's refresh at the moment i flipped over to it, it will not flicker when i flip to the next.\n. I confirm this issue is solved now.\nthnx\n. ",
    "iPaulPro": "@openaphid The Flipboard component actually \"snaps\" to the direction that the finger last moved. Velocity does not matter, and doesn't need to be tracked.\nE.g. If the last touch movement was negative (bottom to top), always flip to the next page, regardless of how the gesture started, or how fast the finger was moving.\nI'd love to see this added, as it allows the user to \"fling\" through pages in an intuitive way. I am looking into the source now, to attempt to implement it myself. It appears that the key is to alter FlipCards.rotateBy() and line forward = angle >= 90; in FlipCards.handleTouchEvent(). Any help is greatly appreciated (as it will take me time to familiarize myself).\nAwesome work!\n. So making the change I describe above is very simple. In FlipCards.handleTouchEvent():\nIn MotionEvent.ACTION_UP \nremove forward = angle >= 90;\nthen in MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE\nadd forward = delta > 0; \n\nThe only issue this causes is that the first page is no longer bound to the MAX_TIP_ANGLE. I will make a pull request if I get that fixed.\n. So the only other change I had to make to support the MAX_TIP_ANGLE boundary was to add\nif (frontCards.getIndex() == -1)\n    forward = true;\nelse if (backCards.getIndex() == -1) \n    forward = false;\nwhere forward = angle >= 90; used to be (in MotionEvent.ACTION_UP).\n@openaphid Let me know if there is an issue with this implementation. I have submitted a pull request: https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/pull/10.\n. @openaphid Unfortunately, I was just able to reproduce this on the develop branch APK. If you flip down a few times, then up a few, and keep repeating, you may see it. It appears to be related to the timing of the touch event (relative to the animation).\n. I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, on the latest dev APK. Good stuff!\n. Flipboard definitely doesn't use velocity tracking. You easily see this by slowly scrolling. The problem here is related to the fact that when scrolling very slowly, its possible that the last actual touch movement was opposite of what you expect. Meaning, when you are scrolling up, and when your finger comes to a stop, it may actually slightly move down before lifting.\nThe best way to fix this is to check for unintended movement. The key is the line that I added:\nforward = delta > 0\nNow that I'm thinking about it, this should really be forward = delta >= 0 which may solve some of this issue. However, it would be best to check to see if the opposite movement was greater than the \"touch slop\". It appears that this is the way Flipboard avoids this issue.\n. Looks like that's what you did in https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/commit/138494b25a0e4bd9943aa00c724c81040d566a21. Sorry, didn't notice that before commenting. :-)\n. > For example, I can slowly scroll a page up in Fipboard android; it goes back as long as the scrolling angle is less than 90 degree.\nDo you have the latest version of Flipboard on Android? This is not the case (I'm not sure that it ever was, to be honest). \nI will try to make a video to prove it, when I get a chance, but I can easily get it to flip up by scrolling very slowly and not passing 90 degrees.\n. Interesting. I just tried on the Nexus One, and the behavior is different than on the Galaxy Nexus. On the N1, it behaves the way you describe. Hm...\nEdit: Referring to this library, not Flipboard. \n. Okay, so I just installed Flipboard on the N1 and it also works the way this library does (at master). The behavior of Flipboars's flip changes between platforms. Considering that the current library works the same as Flipboard on 4.2 and 2.3, respectively, it may actually already be correct.\nI'm going to test Flibboard and FlipView on a bunch of devices and report back soon.\n.

    "VAdaihiep": "@iPaulPro Thanks in advance, I just use your code to fling and it works perfectly. But I seen slightly slower while backward page, sometimes it does NOT perform flip animation. Please tell me how to make it smoother like forward page? \nHope to hear from you soon. Thank you!\n. @openaphid Pls enhancement this soon, I think it will make animation more realistic.\n. @laxman223 You should download the lastest version of android-flip and  import FlipView > FlipLibrary into eclipse.\nThen right click on your project -> Properties > Android > Add > select FlipLibrary (you just import). If not found, in eclipse, right click on FlipLibrary project > Properties > Android > tick Is Library.\n. UPDATE: I think this bug happen because when backward page is slightly slower, I post this issue https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/issues/2.\n@openaphid Please help me, i need to fix it urgently :(\n. :+1: \n. I think if the screenshot already recycle before created new screenshot, the memory can not be out when flip many time because it's de-allocate after recycle(). I mean maybe created and recycle bitmap is not the reason of OOM error, maybe the reason is: Somethings goes bigger after each flipping -> OOM errors.\n. Hi openaphid,\nPlease fix this priority, OOM error often happen when i flip many times.\nThank you.\n. As I told, the reason is NOT capture screenshot because it already recycled.\nI just know that the reason is: Each call getView(), one instance of convertView is allocated in memory so: flip -> getView() -> create new convertView -> ... -> OOM.\nSolution 1: change FlipViewController to use: getViewTypeCount() and getItemViewType() like ListView (more info here http://android.amberfog.com/?p=296)\nSolution 2: change YourAdapter to cache some View with different type and reuse View when item have same type. \nI'm using solution 2 and when i show log heap size to check the memory, the result is good. And since I used this solution,  I have never encountered an OOM error.\nPls try and hope it will help you.\n. Thank you, I will try :)\n. 1, 2. You should use https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader to load image, it's have call back onStart(), onSuccess(), etc. \n@Override\nonStart() {\nprogressBar.setVisible(View.VISIBLE);\n} \n@Override\nonSuccess(){\nflipView.refreshPage(int positionOfPage); // I think it will fix your issue 1\nprogressBar.setVisible(View.GONE);\n}\nIssue 3: You could try to follow my comment https://github.com/openaphid/android-flip/issues/25#issuecomment-11700764\nto fix this OOM.\n. Thank you, your update works very well. \nBut I have a new small issue with new FlipViewController:\nIn your demo FlipButtonActivity, I modified to add more button when flip complete at position near Adapter.getCount()\nflipView.setOnViewFlipListener(new ViewFlipListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onViewFlipped(View view, int position) {\n                if(position > mAdapter.getCount() - 3)\n                    mAdapter.addMoreButton();\n            }\n});\nin class Adapter:\n```\n    int size = 5;\npublic void addMoreButton(){\n    size += 5;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic int getCount() {\n    return size;\n}\n\n```\nThe issue is: When flip to page 4, I can't flip to page 5. But I think mAdapter already added page 5 because when set MAX_TIP_ANGLE = 90; I see number 5. (hope you understand, my english is not good, I can post a picture if you want)\nNote that older versions of FlipViewController isn't have that isssue. \nSo please help me to fix this issue to add dynamic page into Adapter.\nThank you and happy new year!\n. But could you help me make a method in FlipViewController to re-capture the screen for frontCard? I need it to re-capture screen when image in frontCard load complete. Thanks in advance.\n. Could you describe more detail about bug \"when flipping from right to left\"?\n. You should use getItemViewType() instead of switch(position) \nMore detail here: http://android.amberfog.com/?p=296 (part Different list items\u2019 layouts)\n. You can try to use Android SwipeRefreshLayout: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/SwipeRefreshLayout.html\n. ",

Hi guys, I guess the problem is while taking screenshot in grabIt.java file in higher resolution mobiles previous screenshot is released to free memory.

I shot a new video about the problem too, you can find it in \"video\" folder. \nI guess I got the problem: it seems it happens when application downloads image for background. After the download when I begin the gesture for flipping, the background image is being released immediately. Maybe you can add a listener so when the gesture ends you release the image. That should do the trick.\n. Yep. Setting the value to 5000 solved that issue. But after I have implemented the solution I noticed another bug on S3. While I was sliding through the pages I saw some pages coming full white at first then the actual layout. I don't think It's caused by async content because the page comes with complete white other than this I have high speed internet connection. I shot a video about the bug. It's rather short video but you can see the bug. And sorry for the quality.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5XTKueIIKY\n. And the layout is almost similar to one you looked early. I just took your relative layout advice and changed view and added cache code for the content image downloader. I can send the layout xml and the Flip Item class too if you want.\n.

    "jmmosa": "oh it didnt appeared anymore after i use the develop branch. Thanks for replying. \n. I reopened it because the problem occured again but this time its like this:\nI have 2 fragments and both of them have flipview + the imageloader that the default flipview has. THe 1st fragment has only 1 view then the 2nd fragment has  2. The problem occurs when i flip the flipview first time in the fragment 2. a white view will show at first and then it will show the real view then if I flip it several times it will go white. But for example the flipview in fragment 1 has 0 view then the problem wont show, but when I added a view in the fragment 1 flipview and updated it it will not show the problem. The problem will occur when I close and reopen the app.\n. Yup.\n. Hellow I tried using the setOverFlipEnabled but whenever I tried flipping it from top to bot, it will freeze if its not the very start or very last view.\n. So the setOverFlipEnabled is not usable for now?\n. ok the setOverFlipEnabled is working well but when the view is only one, the view can still be flipped from top to bottom but it wont be flipped if its from bottom to top.

It occurs basically when you put down your finger on the right edge and move back to the left edge and then keep the finger down in that location for some more time. Sometimes it is not easy to reproduce. Of course it is only left and right if the orientation is set to horizontal. Not sure if the same bug occurs with vertical orientation.\n. ",

Delaying by 200ms and setting the container layout backgrounds to white seems to be the best fix for now.\n. @CRUDTechnolgoy @charithjob I've also faced a similar issue. I am using a complex layout containing TextViews, an ImageView (loads online images) and a WebView. When the page flips the ImageView and WebView is empty. I have somehow mitigated this problem by doing three things:\n1. Setting a default image for the ImageView stored as a drawable to be displayed if there is a load error, no network+Internet connection and when it is still loading\n2. Increase private final int sideBufferSize in FlipViewController class\n3. Call for FlipViewController.refreshPage(View) after loading the WebView & ImageView\nThe interesting thing is that the problem now is only limited to the first two pages, thereafter upon flipping beyond the first two pages and flipping back the problem is gone (changing sideBufferSize did not change the result).\n. It appears that the issue might have been resolved by setting a loading view for the WebView (currently its height and width are set to match parent), because I only did that and somehow I can no longer reproduce the error. Will close if it no longer appears after a week or two.\n. Closed issue on 19 Feb 2016, resolve the titled problem using the above-mentioned steps.\n. If you do not want a transparent/translucent screen while flipping you may have to set android:background=\"#ffffff\" for your FlipView container.\nAlternatively, you may have meant that the image is not in the screenshot during the flipping action, which occurs because the . I temporarily worked around the issue by using a loading image which solves the issue most of the time:\n[ImageView ID].setDefaultImageResId(R.drawable.[loading_default]); // loading image\n[ImageView ID].setErrorImageResId(R.drawable.[offline_default]); // error image\nAlso increase the buffer size by changing this in FlipViewController.java:\nprivate final int sideBufferSize = [>1];\nSome other ideas I had were to refresh all the screenshots again once all the views are loaded or just before flipping but I haven't tried them yet.\n.

Unfortunately, since it is private, I couldn't override/call the AdapterView's updateEmptyStatus method, so I had to copy it (maybe use reflection? but I'm not very familiar with it).
