    "DamnWidget": "I think this is because the package control name mapping. Fixed already.\n. Don't worry, it's all right.\nI added new Default for Mac OS X in the last commit. So I guess the plugin is working just right on Mac OS X?\nRegards.\n. Hi.\nThe server binds to random ports (checking first if them are free), this is needed mainly because there is an active server for each Sublime Text 3 open window . It's normal that you get some connection refused just when the plugin is being activated (when you first write in soome python file) or after more than 30 minutes of inactivity.\nLet me know if the keys problem is solved in order to close this issue.\nRegards.\n. Yes please\n. Hi.\nUnless you deactivate/activate or edit the plugin (forcing ST to reload it) you will get some of those errors when the plugin efectively starts but no later.\nThere shoudl be one jsonserver.py process  per open window (that can be easily checked with the UNIX ps command like:\nps -ax | grep jsonserver\nThe line should look like:\nPackages/anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p <project_name> <listen_port> [-e <extra_paths>] <Sublime Text 3 PID>\nNote that the parameters between brackets are optionals\nThe JsonServer will kill itself after five seconds if it detects it's parent process (Sublime Text plugin server) is not running anymore or if there is no activity in the last 30 minutes.\nI think the problem may be related with the plugin being not able to really get the process ID or being not able to check it properly.\nYou can just check it looking at the Sublime Text PID, the plugin_host PID and the parameters for the JsonServer that the ps command resturns to you.\n. By the way, on Mac OS X you can find a directory called jedi under your user account, (/Users/<username>/.jedi) that shoudl contain a directory per each window that you have open.\nIf your window is containing a valid Sublime Text project, then the directories inside the .jedi directory should be named as your projects, if not, then those directories should be named as the root folder of your first open folder or if you are not opening any folder but files, something like anaconda-<window_id> that is not descriptive or reusable at all should be displayed.\nAnyway, inside those directories you can find an anaconda_jsonserver.log file with information about what is happening to your jsonserver process.\nRegards\n. Hi @mchampanis \nFirst of all, thank you for your contribution. \nI think this change will solve the problem. Can you pull request this change so I can merge properly?\nYou don't need to add /Users/michael/.virtualenv/bettech/lib/python2.7 as extra path in your configuration. If you are using the interpreter in your bettech virtualenv, it will see all the packages that you have installed on it with no more configuration in your side.\nThe AttributeError exception is really weird, window should be always defined at this point. The server seems to be working fine in your Mac OS X installation but there is some problem anywhere..\nI don't have any Mac OS X machine to fix those problems, anyway, OSX is just BSD that is just Unix so Linux and OSX behaviour should be quite similar so I need to reproduce the AttributeError above.\nCan you tell me what your configuration is and in which circumstances do you get this error? \nP.D: I really thought that the proc directory was POSIX standard but seems like is Linux related only\n. Fixed, thank you for your feedback.\n. By the way, if you installed using git clone you may have to rename the directory to \"Anaconda\" with capitalized \"A\", look at 7f38db949fa41ffc05656c943e90e9564f5b2962\n. Hi.\nThat's supposed to complete the methods of the object that load_workbook returns but seems like the underlying Jedi library is crashing (I just did the same test than you).\nGive me some time to investigate what's happening with the Jedi library and discover if it's a Jedi library bug or is just that I am using it wrong.\n. Seems like Jedi has some problem parsing docstrings from openpyxl library, I'm working on it to understand where the problem is and provide a fix for the Jedi project or just report it to them.\n. That's good :):\n. @davidhalter (the Jedi lead developer) fixed this problem already in the development version of the Jedi library. If we are lucky and he has the time to fix other six bugs, the new Jedi release will be available next friday.\nI will update our Jedi version with the new release as fast as is released.\nRegards.\n. Hi @mchampanis \nI have updated the Jedi library to the last version that was released yesterday night.\nRegards.\n. The linter part of the plugin needs to be eventually fully refactored because now it's really a port from SublimeLinter with some optimization improvements.\nI will take a look at flake8 then.\n. Hi @dan-Blanchard\nIf you don't mind to open a new issue with this topic about pylint we can discuss it with the rest of the community.\nRegards.\n. Hi @ekarlso \nI don't understand what you mean, why are you stuck with linting stuff? Anaconda already has full support for PyFlakes and PEP8, so use or not use flakes8 is a convenience matters.\nI didn't had the time to check that library so I didn't analyze what the impact of switch can be or what the problems are or how trustable is use a layer from a third in terms of actualizations.\nI have to consider how easy is to turn on and off each linter using flakes8. There is an interesting question about Pylint as well.\n. I don't see the need to add a new wrapping layer in the top of those libraries, I'm not going to implement this but I will consider any pull request that adds it (but I really don't think we need this at all).\n. Hi.\nI felt it slow on windows as well but in my case there weren't any errors I will take a look again this weekend to try to improve performance on Windows platform.\n. Try with the last update. I found a possible bug in the way that windows was chacking the existence of the plugin_host process and maybe it was killing the JSON Server that lints and autocomplete every five seconds.\nWaiting for feedback.\n. I already found the problem, I'm trying to fix it.\nSeems like windows decide to use 1 second of timeout for connects the client to the server so every call is artificially slowed down by the Windows socket internals just one second. This is what I get in the profiler:\n```\nFunc request took 1.0369999408721924 secs\n         198 function calls in 1.038 seconds\nOrdered by: internal time\nncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\n        2    1.020    0.510    1.020    0.510 {method 'connect' of '_socket.socket' objects}\n        1    0.016    0.016    0.016    0.016 {method 'recv_into' of '_socket.socket' objects}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {built-in method getaddrinfo}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {built-in method decode_value}\n        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {built-in method load_settings}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {built-in method view_window}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {built-in method view_cached_substr}\n```\nSo, one completion that should take 0.0369 seconds just took 1.0369\nWhy is doing that Windows? That's a really good question...\n. I am reopening this to get your feedbacks and double-check that this is already fixed\n. Hi @highend \nThat's weird, it's working really fast in my Windows desktop.\nYou get \"[Errno 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it\"?\nCan you paste the log file in C:\\Users\\AppData\\Jedi\\Jedi\\anaconda_jsonserver.log?\n. Hi @highend \nJedi is already included as part of anaconda so you don't need to install it..\nThat problme can be related to two things:\n1) For whatever reason the jsonserver can't be started and the client is just trying to connect to closed port\n2) The firewall is preventing the incoming connection from the jsonclient to the jsonserver\nLets try something.\n1. Open a PowerShell  and point yourself to C:\\Users\\Highend\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sublime Text 3\\Packages\\Anaconda\n2. type: tasklist\n3. look for 'plugin_host.exe' and write down its PID\n   4 type: python anaconda_server\\jsonserver.py 9999 <the PID that you wrote down in the previous step>\nThere is some error?\n. Idk why but the Jedi library is not creating it's cache directories in your AppData\\Roaming directory.\nCan you check if you can write in that directory?\n. Now you will have a Jedi folder in your AppData\\Roaming directory, can you check the anaconda_jsonserver.log files there?\n. Oh, I didn't read about the not useful information in the Jedi directory.\nDid you notice if the linting is working? You get autocompletion? You will get some of those ones eventually if for example the underlyign Jedi library crashes or the server encounter a problem and it closes itself.\n. Hi @schlamar and @highend \nThe last version add profiling support for windows. To enable you have to change the setting anaconda_debug from false to profiling. You will get then a full profiling log in your ST3 console that will help me to trace the possible problem.\nThanks.\n. Hi @highend \nYou have some kind of problem in the configuration file, some unclosed quotes I guess. The FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] Das System kann die angegebene Datei nicht finden that you get is because config file can't be parsed and the plugin can't access any Python interpreter\n. @schlamar can you paste your anaconda_jsonserver.log for the three seconds call?\nI can't think any logic explanation for this huge amount of time (in the 3 secs one) unless you are completing a really huge module like Numpy or PySide. (and it will take this long only the first time when Jedi is generating it;s cache)\n. @highend it's \"profiler\"\n@schlamar yup, I agree, I'm working on fix it it already\n. @highend in Windows, the first autocompletion try always take 1 seconds because Windows implementation of sockets.\nCan you try to post at least 3 of them?\nIf you use a triple crasis to quote the results you will get it formatted by Github.\n. I'm so sad that you are having all those problems.\nSeems like your jsonserver.py process is just crashing and being created again for each completion or linting call. There should be something in the AppData\\Jedi\\Jedi logs.\nBtw, try to start the server using the command line and the same interpreter that you are using now.\nC:\\Python\\python \"C:\\Users\\Highend\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sublime Text 3\\Packages\\Anaconda\\anaconda_server\\jsonserver.py -p test 9999 1\nTell me if you get some error, tell me about the python interpreter that you are using as well.\n. I have to open a new issue for this, seems like jsonserver.py doesn't support python 3\n. Hi.\nAnaconda is now full asynchronous so no more GUI waiting in autocompletion.\n. Seems like you are not using the last update. The 331 line should look like this one:\nif not PID in output.decode()\n. I was wondering why I don't get this error. It's because my Windows box is in English, yours is in German.\nI have to improve the jsonserver Python 3 support, I will do it this weekend.\n. Is working fine in my Windows with python 3.3 now.\n. Can you do a tasklist in your PowerShell or cmd.exe and paste the results?\n. There was a problem with unicode characters in non english Windows, I fixed it in asynchronous branch that is now merged with master.\n. You can donate to oscar.campos@open-phoenix.com in PayPal if you wish.\n. There can be two possible sources for this error:\n1) The anaconda json server can't be started\n2) Your firewall is blocking connections to the anaconda json server\nPossible workaround:\nMake sure you are not filtering connections for localhost in your firewall settings\nIf the problme persist, look at C:\\Users\\AppData\\Roamin\\Jedi\\Jedi directory for files called \"anaconda_jsonserver.log\" and check if there is some exceptions or problems with the server.\nIf there are exceptions or no Jedi folder is found in your system, make sure you are using the last version of the plugin, if you are, open a PowerShell or cmd.exe and type:\ncd \"C:\\Users\\Roamin\\Sublime Text 3\\Packages\\Anaconda\\\"\npython anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p test 9999 1\nIf there is some exception come back and share it here.\n. Hi.\nI just merged the asynchronous branch into master so lot of things has been changed now. \nCan you check if you are experiencing the same problem using the last commit?\n. Wow, that so strange.\nLet me know if you get the firewall configured to allow connections from localhost to localhost so we can try to solve whatever problem that you have after check the firewall is not being the problem.\n. Ok, thats good news cos we can discard firewall issues.\nOpen a PowerShell or a CMD.exe\nGo to C:\\Users\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sublime Text \n3\\Packages\\Anaconda\nThen try to run the JSON server with:\nC:\\Python\\python.exe anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p \ntest 9999 1\u00a0\nIf there is no errors in the terminal just check the contents of the \nfile:\nC:\\Users\\AppData\\Roaming\\Jedi\\Jedi\\test\\anconda_jsonserver.log\nWaiting for your results\nOn Tue, Aug 13, 2013 at 4:32 PM, daniele-niero \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi,\nThe It guys said the firewall is not in use. Wee have McCAfe but they \ncheck it and they were quite positive that it wasn't causing any \ntrouble to this plugin... :(\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Hi @daniele-niero \n\nI think your problem may be realted with this https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda#troubleshoting\nTake a look.\n. It was supposed to work with Python 2.6, let me review it.\n. Seems like there is some problem with jsonserver and the interpreter that you have configured to be used. Can you look at Jedi logs into the folder of the project that is giving you the problems?\n. Hi @divmain refer to #35 \n. This should be fixed now, sorry for any inconvenience that this problem may have caused you.\n. I always found it as a very annoying feature I didn't implemented because that. It's now in my TODO list.\n. I think I'm going to make it totally enable/disable  by configuration. In this way ppl that gets annoyed with it can just turn it off completely and don't feeling the need to kill me or themselves. \n. Is this working fine for you @daniele-neiro?\n. This is because the ST3 autocompletion event does not get triggered. I will investigate how can I make this work when I get some time.\n. It shouldn't work on files that are not python, it doesn't even work on python strings or comments. The linting method is decorated with this decorator:\n```\ndef only_python(func):\n    \"\"\"Execute the given function if we are on Python source only\n    \"\"\"\n@functools.wraps(func)\ndef wrapper(self, view, *args, **kwargs):\n\n    if is_python(view):\n        return func(self, view, *args, **kwargs)\n\nreturn wrapper\n\n...\ndef is_python(view):\n    \"\"\"Determine if the given view location is python code\n    \"\"\"\nlocation = view.sel()[0].begin()\nmatcher = 'source.python - string - comment'\n\nreturn view.match_selector(location, matcher)\n\n```\nSo it shouldn't try to lint any file that is not Python source. I don't think this should happen. Can you check if closing the file and open it again it lints it?\n. Thats because the linting request is fired by a Python view but when the remote method is called on the server the actual view from the actual window has been replaced with a non-python buffer.\nIt will be eventually fixed.\n. Hi @andrewning\nI'm workin in #13 right now but this is the next on the list.\n. You are right, seems like the autocompletion is removing some snippets from the combo box. \n. I just push a commit to the asyncblime branch that uses the new custom minimalist IO loop that is asyncore/asynchat free.\nI will test it today at work in GNU/Linux platform, if some of you can test it in Windows and Mac OS X I will really appreciate it.\n. Hi guys.\nAs you know package control suffer some changes last week, one of them is that it leaves it's beta state and they improve their website and the way that the packages are categorized, and now it's so cool.\nYou have to uninstall package control form your Sublime Text 3 (just using the control palette) and then copy and paste this into the Sublime Text console:\nimport urllib.request,os; pf = 'Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp = sublime.installed_packages_path(); urllib.request.install_opener( urllib.request.build_opener( urllib.request.ProxyHandler()) ); open(os.path.join(ipp, pf), 'wb').write(urllib.request.urlopen( 'http://sublime.wbond.net/' + pf.replace(' ','%20')).read())\nI will report this to wbond as well.\n. I'm closing this as seems like ppl is not experiencing more problems and this is added to the troubleshoting section in the README.md\n. GitHub was under a serious DDoS attack like one hour ago. \nCan you try to donwload it now?\nBtw, you need the version 2.0 or better for Package Control.\n. By the way, there were several problems related with the library that we were using for asynchronous socket operations but I just merge a replacement that will solve the exception that you get.\nMore info: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/messages/0.1.4.txt\n. You're welcome :)\n. Hi.\nI used PyLinter with ST2 and I didn't liked it, I can't remember now why exactly but I am open to discuss about it's inclusion in Anaconda.\nIt's anyone else supporting that inclusi\u00f3n in anaconda?\n. I think I am definitely going to add Pylint as configurable alternative to PyFlakes, so the user can just configure the plugin to use PyFlakes or Pylint. Pylint is extemely verbose and sometimes maybe annoying but I think support it in Anaconda will be a good thing and can't make any hurt.\nThis is not going to be a fast implementation, I will create a new branch so users can test it before reintegrate in the master branch of the plugin.\n. Anaconda supports now PyLint as linting \"library\". I think is the first plugin that support the three big linting libraries for python.\n. I fixed that in the last commit, thanks.\n. This is a duplicate of #21 \n. Hi @pbanaszkiewicz \nFirst of all we have to make sure the problem is being caused by Anaconda. The only thing that I can see in the screenshot is just the CPU is being used intensively but that's not very useful.\nAnaconda do all it's stuff in separate subprocesses running as standalone Python servers so it has nothing to do with the sublime text 3 plugin_host process.\nPaste the output of the command ps aux | grep anaconda to see if the anaconda servers are doing something.\nShould be helpful if you provide a list of the plugins that you had activacted when you run into this problem. If you can see if there is some debug output in the ST3 console should be great as well.\n. Weird, I am using GNU/Gentoo x86_64 with ST3 build 3047 and I don't experience any issue in ST3.\nCan I close this issue then?\n. Hi @emyller and @pbanaszkiewicz \nI really appreciate that you find this bug, I just reaponed this issue and changed some labels on it. I will fix this issue has fast as possible.\nThanks.\n. I never felt my machine slow because I have a really great hardware so I didn't noticed any slow down in the system.\nThank you so much for finding this one.\n. Well, I'm not sure why your ST3 was using so much memory but the only problem with the bug was just a thread with a while wasn't sleeping at all and was running with no sleep just wasting CPU resources, nothing related with memory.\n@pbanaszkiewicz my machine is:\nEVGA X3 SLI Mobo\n1x Intel i7 930 2.900MHz with 4 cores and 8 threads\n6x 2G DDR3 2000MHx triple channeled into the EVGA Mobo\nRegards.\n. Hi @pbanaszkiewicz \nTake a look at #1 I just moved all the code to import from \"Anaconda\" just because Package Control uppercases the repo name on installation. Because that in the documentation when using git you can read:\ngit clone https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda.git Anaconda \nI think I can just rename the repo but I didn't tried to do it yet.\n. I just merged this branch, sorry for the delay but I was really busy at work those days.\nCan we think about a good way to deal with Main.sublime-menu file? Maybe generate this file from the plugin? Anything better?\n. Hi.\nYou don't really need the extra_path, Anaconda is able to autocomplete whatever library your configured interpreter can import from it's PYTHONPATH\nBtw, you really want to use  \"python_interpreter\",  \"python_interpreter_path\" is just for SublimeJEDI I think.\n. Any update here @ekarlso? Can I close this issue?\n. You don't need to add any extra path. Anaconda will add you project folder itself as extra path and Jedi will be able to see anything that your configured python interpreter can see.\nMake sure the packages that you want to autocomplete/goto/findusages are installed in your virtuale nv. It's safe for you if your remove the full extra_paths setting from your project config file.\n. Hi @phoenixyz \nAs you can see in this screenshot I have no problems with PySide in Linux \n\nIn fact, the main motivation that I had to write this plugin was just I needed PySide autocompletion working (it doesn't work on SublimeRope/SublimePythonIDE) and SublimeJEDI is slow.\nYou shouldnt have any problem with .egg contained packages as far as yor intepreter can see them. In th eother hand, I compiled PySide myself but this has nothing to do with your problem.\nI'm not familiar with Windows platform but if you are  not able to make it work, I suggest you to open an issue in Jedi's project itself.\nBtw, have you tried my SublimePySide plugin?\nRegards.\n. I will take a look at this problem when I get some time and can have a windows machine around. If there is a problem with egg binary files it should be reported to Jedi project.\nRegards.\n. Hi.\nJedi has a problem with python bindings on Python 3, the author was already aware of the problem and there had been progress in solve the issue. The fix is in the development branch of jedi. I will include it as soon as they move it to the stable branch.\n. Thank you so much.\n. Hi.\nAre you sure in SiblimeLinter it only disables it for the current view?.\nI don't think implement this feature is something that we can not add to\nthe plugin so consider it almost done already.\nOn Aug 20, 2013 7:11 PM, \"mystickphoenix\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSublimeLinter has a quick option for disabling linting on the current view:\nDisable Linting - Disables linting mode for the current view and clears\nall lint errors.\nIs there any way Anaconda can support a similar option?

I don't think SublimeLinter support this feature at all, it seems like they disable the full linter, but we do now.\n. Great, thank you.\n. I'm not sure... \n\nI never understood in which way that feature was useful in SublimeLinter, I mean, you have already your full file linted you can just scroll up and down.\nIs someone else missing this feature?\n. You made a point\n. Hi\nI can't reproduce this error myself, but seems like your ST3 embedded python interpreter is trying to open the file as ASCII encodign by default. I'm going to add a small change to force python to open the file as utf8.\n. @spamwax can you confirm this problem is gone with the last commited version of the plugin?\nThanks.\n. Perfect\n. Hi @gg4u \nI think you got the wrong project. This is Anaconda, the plugin for Sublime Text 3, not anaconda the python distribution.\nSorry.\n. Hi.\nThis is a problem with ST3. It doesn't support cProfile in POSIX.\nhttps://github.com/SublimeText/Issues/issues/127\n. I'm not totally sure this is an Anaconda issue but a Sublime Text one. I need some time to investigate it.\n. It was a problem in Anaconda, thanks for report it.\n. Hi.\nYou can follow some steps to try to figure out what can be happening here.\n1) Open the Sublime Text 3 console and check if there are some errors\n2) Make sure your python3 interpreter is in your path\n3) Try to run the jsonserver.py application manually from the command line using that interpreter. (this should be in /Users//Library/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Anaconda/jsonserver, and you should try to run it from the Anaconda root directory)\nCome back here with the results you get from those actions.\n. The log look normal but you should see something like Registering handler with address ('localhost', 56958) eventually.\nThe error you get from jsonserver.py is because you have to pass it a port number and a PID number, try to pass it port 9999 and PID 1\nI don't know about the dropbox trick, maybe is a problem, maybe not.\n. Hi @anticorrelator \nThis error is because there are worng parameters in the invocation of the script.\nTry to run the jsonserver with: python3 anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p test 9999 1\nThen you will get some logs in: `/Users//Library/Caches/Jedi/test/anaconda_jsonserver.log\n. Well, that's so weird.\nThe output that you get from the terminal is not consistent with the log you get in the log file. \nCan you try to use a real PID (process ID) as the last parameter? For example the real \"plugin_host\" process ID.\n. This is going to be very hard to debug because I don't have any Mac OS X machine to try to replicate the problem. The only thing that you can do is look at the /Users//Library/Caches/Jedi directory to check what the logs for your different projects are just saying and try to discover what the possible problem is.\nMaybe this homebrew installed version of python is lacking some library or it have some type of problem, I can tell you that it works perfect with the last 3.3.x version of Python in Windows and Linux but I don't have any Apple computer to develop the plugin.\nI am using the plugin with several virtualenvs and all works flawless, try to get more information from the logs and we will see what is going on with this problem.\n. Please, refer to #35 \n. This should be fixed now, sorry for any inconvenience that this problem may have caused you.\n. You are welcome\n. Mea culpa, should be fixed now.\n. This could be possibly added to the refactor IDE functionallity of the plugin but is another 3rd party library to maintain.\nThere is more ppl supporting the inclusion of this tool in the plugin?\n. I've decided to accept this proposal. Should be included in the next release.\n. Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.\nYou can disable line too long PEP8 error just adding \"E501\" to the pep8_ignore list in the configuration file.\n. Well, 79 is default because that is just what PEP8 define as maximum line length -> http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length\nI don't see the point to allow override this PEP8 definition.\n. I forgot to thank you for your interest and feedback, so I'm just doing now :)\n. It has to work @srugano \nhow and where are you configuring pep8_max_line_length?\n. @JayRizzo SublimePythonIDE is another plugin . Seems like the jsonserver is crashing, do you have something in Jedi logs?\n. Any update on this one?\n. ~/.cache/jedi//anaconda_jsonserver.log\n.

Hi again @dan-blanchard \nWhich version of pylint are you using?\n. If you try to run the pylint in the files you are editing manually... what happens?\n. I am running now the exact same configuration than you and all is working fine, no spawning processes and no unpack errors.\nI have no clue man.\n. I think this is related with the contents of the files you are editing. It's possible that my parse_errors method does not parse some message that you are getting from the Pylint.\nI just added a workaround to prevent the JsonServer to crash and spawn processes again and again.\nPlease, upgrade your anaconda and check your jedi logs eventually to find this error message unhandled exception in PyLinter parse_errors this is a non fatal error: blah bla bla and come back with feedback.\nThanks.\n. Hi @dan-blanchard any update on this issue?\n. Thanks man I will work on it as soon as I have some time.\n. Well, this seems to be a problem with PyLint itself. This exception is raised by pytlint/checkers/variables.pyin lines 534-535:\npython\nexcept Exception as exc:\n    print('Unhandled exception in VariablesChecker:', exc)\nNothing that I can do, I will just close the issue and tag it as PyLint.\nIf you like the plugin, just speak to your friends and work mates about it :)\nThanks and regards.\n. Hi\nI don't have any problem in add that but I want to introduce you with my friend the issue #40 \nIn files of considerable size this is really slow, and when I say slow, I meant it, like one minute, I'm not going to use the AutoPEP8 format myself (I prefer to just disable linting in some files that I am forced to open that doesn't follow PEP8 at all) bit if I add this autoformat on save behaviour is going to be off by default.\n. I don't have problems with linting python big files (and some of my work mates write files with thousands lines, fucking crazy).\nI will add this option when I have some time to do it and I already fix the #40 issue\n. Hi\nYou were right, some relative imports were needed in the new command package from jsonserver but in your case:\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'python3'\nMake sure your python3 executable is in your $PATH\nRegards.\n. Try to use the absolute route:\n\"python_interpreter\": \"/usr/local/bin/python3\"\n. Thanks man\n. Thank you for your contribution.\n. Thanks again man\n. I'm not sure about the relation between the plugin and virtual environments in vagrant/virtualbox.\nI mean, if you have SublimeText installed in a vagrant environment, just install the plugin in that Sublime Text.\nIf what you mean is can use a python installation that resides in a vagrant environment I don't thing it has nothing to do with vagrant but with support the plugin to work with SSH (slowing down the speed of the plugin commands, not of the ST3).\nCan you clarify a bit what you mean please?\n. Add that support to plugin level can be really painful but there are some tricks that you can use to try to make it work.\n- You can add a VirtualBox shared folder (http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders) where your python interpreter resides into a virtualenv(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper) container\n- You can use SSHFS for Mac OS X to mount locally a remote directory that resides in your vagrant/VirtualBox environment (https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/SSHFS)\n- You can export with NFS a directory from your vagrant/VirtualBox environment and mount it in your Mac OS X (http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/mounting-nfs-volumes-in-os-x/)\nThen you can just add the Mac OS X local route to the python virtualenv locally mounted directory and it should work, a bit slow maybe but it should.\n. Oh you are right, there are incompatibility binary platform issues that I didn't thought about.\nMaybe this can be approached from another perspective, let me think about it some time.\n. I don't find any possible solution to the binary compatibility problem here, maybe an option should be just replicate the development python environment using virtualenv in the machine were Sublime Text is installed and try to maintain it synchronized with the development vagrant/VirtualBox environment.\nMaybe some tool that is capable to run a pip freeze in the target development machine and generate the same environment in the local host is desirable but not sure if it fits the scope of this plugin. I think on it more like a plugin for virtualenvwrapper or something like that.\nI'm so sorry for can't be more helpful with that.\n. Look at issue #52\n. First version of running remotes/vagrant guest machines is pushed on development branch. To make this work on vagrant environments some workaround and a checkout of the vagrant_server branch in the target guest machine is needed. \nSome documentation about vagrant support has been added to the wiki on https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Vagrant-Environments but a lot more of documentation is needed, I will write more documentation and refactor the code tomorrow hopefully.\nI am currently linting and autocompleting my development version of anaconda with a python interpreter running in a vagrant guest machine configured with public IP address, thats pretty amazing. I have to test forwarded and private yet but now is time to sleep.\n. As more I think about this feature, less I think anaconda really need something like that. I am refusing myself on this one.\n. Unfortunately I am not using Python too much nowadays as I am using Golang more often, I would take a look at what PyDev is doing (as it have even a remote debugger that is pretty cool) to get some ideas from there.\n. Hi @eivind88 \nLooking forward to see how you progress on that, we need contributors as I don't have too much time as I am not working with Python professionally anymore.\n. Btw, can you modify the README.md file to reflect this addition?\n. This happens with new files or with files that already exists?\n. I can't reproduce it...\nWhich configuration are you using?\nOperating system?\nPlugins installed?\n. I will take a look in my windows VM tomorrow. Thanks.\n. We can always delete regions added for other plugins but I'm not sure howto do it in a non global way and only in the lines that we need them.\n. Those gutter icons are just part of defined regions, there is no way to be aware of changes on regions so don't see any way to do that in an effective way.\n. Closing this one as I don't see any possible solution for that\n. Hi @Gnugamel \nI need a bit of more information.\nWhich version of python are you using for the interpreter?\nWhat logs do you have in $HOME/.cache/jedi directory?\nRegards.\n. That looks just as non problem logs. I will give a try to the 2.6 interpreter later. maybe support has been broken in recently updates.\n. I just test it with Python 2.6.8 in my Sabayon Linux and it's working fine. \nWhich other plugins do you have installed?\nDid you try to restart Sublime Text 3?\n. I'm not sure, maybe.\nCan you try to disable everyone plugin except anaconda, restart ST3 and try if it works? If it works try to enable one by one all the plugins that you are using, if any of them is conflicting with anaconda we will discover it in this way.\nRegards.\n. With Sublime Text 3 running and anaconda enabled, paste the output of the following command:\nps aux | grep python\nThanks.\n. I have no clue about whats wrong with your installation.\nLet's do the following:\n1. Disable any other plugin and restart ST3\n2. Open your sublime console in your project window\n3. execute the following command in your terminal: `tail -f ~/.cache/jedi/H0G90/anaconda_jsonserver.log\n4. Go to your sublime text and press super (windows key) + d twice\n5. Paste what is printed on ST3 console and the tail -f terminal log\n6. Explain in your own words what happened when you pressed the keys combination\n. Seems like the jsonserver is having some problem that is not being logged in the log file. I need to try to reproduce you exact same configuration so I need the exact python version that you are using to download and compile it to try to replicate the problem.\nIf I can't replicate the problem I will not be able to solve it.  I know your python version is 2.6 but I need the third number as well, and know the distribution may help as well.\n. I am going to add some facility to the user can run the jsonserver in debug mode from the command line and make the plugin connect to it, I will update this issue when done.\nBtw, SLES = Suse Linux Enterprise?\n. From anaconda config file:\nDebug Mode:\n```\n    If you need to debug the jsonserver.py service for any reason, you\n    can configure the following options to make the plugin to connect\n    always to the same port in your local machine.\nProcedure:\n\n    1. Set the debug_mode as true\n    2. Set the debug_port to your desired port\n    3. Close Sublime Text 3\n    4. cd to your Packages/Anaconda directory\n    5. start the jsonserver manually:\n        python -B anaonda_server/jsonserver.py -p test 9999 DEBUG\n    6. Start your Sublime Text 3 and\n\nThen your anaconda plugin will use the configured server and you will\nget debug messages in the terminal where you ran it\n\n```\n. Ok, seems like there is some problem related with the parameters unpack in Python 2.6.0, I will be mainly off today but I will try to fix this later in the afternoon.\nRegards.\n. This seems like your Operating System is preventing the plugin_host process (which is the one that executes the python plugins) from spawning new subprocesses.\nI don't think this problem should be permanent, in your case.\nWhich operating system and version of python interpreter are you using?\nRegards.\n. Hi @triklozoid \nI'm glad that the problem is gone :) and don't be sorry, I need ppl like you that report problems.\nRegards.\n. I forget to update this issue. It's implemented already.\n. Hi\nThis HTML(Mako) syntax is not Sublime Text native, can you tell me which plugin adds it?\n. I can't replicate the problem.\nI installed Mako.tmbundle and mako library, those are my resuts:\n\n. Ok, I reloaded the file and I get it linted.\nThat's funny because is_python returns False and this file should never be linted.\n. It should work fine now.\nRegards.\n. I didn't experienced the problem when save. Did you?\n. I added it in the last commit\n. It works just fine for me, in fact, there is no relation between pyflakes and DEBUG mode.\nCan you just double check please?\n. Pretty weird man.\nCan you copy the content of the file here so I can just test with the same code please.\n. Ok, what is happening here is just anaconda does not complete or try to complete when you are writting into a comment or a string just to save some CPU and resources.\n. Fixed, thanks\n. This one is curious at least :)\n. Hi.\nIf you don't provide us with any type of logs from your ST3 console we are not being able to tell you if there is any type of problem that is causing anaconda to spawn more than one jsonserver in your instalation.\nNormally there is only one instance of anaconda per ST3 window, if you have one window active then you should have only one instance.\nIs not like anaconda is choosing to run anything behind your back without inform you, there must be some type of problem that is making anaconda spawn more processes than are really needed.\nBtw, the jsonserver will not waste any of your CPU or memory if no ST3 is attached to it, they will kill themselves after 30 minutes of total inactivity from the ST3 side.\nBtw, the purpose of the jsonserver is clearly documented in the README.md file of this project:\n```\nAnaconda architecture\nAnaconda is an asynchronous client-server architecture application. It starts a new server instance\nfor any open Sublime Text window that contains Python code.\nBecause that architecture, anaconda can lint or complete with python interpreters different than\nthe built-in Sublime Text 3 python interpreter (3.3). It can complete all the python code that\nthe configured interpreter can see and lint files for that version of the interpreter.\n```\nPlease, update this issue with the log that you can get from you ST3 console and from the files located at %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Jedi\\Jedi \nUPDATE: If you are not running ST3 there shouldn't be any instance of jsonserver running in your machine, in fact, the jsonserver will kill himself if the plugin_host application is not running. That is checked using the windows command line tool tasklist by the jsonserver each five seaconds.\nRegards.\n. Hi.\nWhy you closed this issue? Did you solve it by yourself?\nRegards\n.

This is legacy from SublimeLinter, you are a nightmare btw :)\n. Solved, thanks man.\n. Sorry for the delay, I am really busy on work today.\n\nYou can start jsonserver in debug mode and checks what the sever is doing. The instructions to do it are at the very top of anaconda settings file.\n. Hi\nYou dont need to pass any extra path in the settings, you only need to configure a python interpreter that already can see the PyQt and PySide modules.\n. Take into account that anaconda is spawning a subprocess with the python interpreter that you configured in order to autocomplete.\nTry to add a .pythonstartup in your home directory with the following content and restart your Sublime Text 3 to test it:\n``` python\nimport sys\nsys.append('/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages')\n```\n. That's for any python interpreter but you may have to add this to your $HOME/.bashrc file:\nbash\nexport PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonstartup\n. You don't have to care about what ST3 has in the sys.path, anaconda does not use ST3 python interpreter to complete or lint, it uses your configured python interpreter instead, and your configured python interpreter should use your .pythonstartup.py file.\nI don't have any Mac machine to test that but it should work. You can also try to set youor PYTHONPATH in your .bashrc file as well.\n. Any update on this? Did you get it working?\n. The extra_paths are meant to do exactly that but you told me that it doesn't worked for you. You can try to add some extra paths into your proyect configuration or globaly in your Anaconda.sublime-settings.\n. It's weird, I just dbl checked the code that pass the extra paths to the python subprocess that run the linter and the completions and it takes into account project configuration so it should work.\n. ST3 view.file_name() method is returning None instead of empty string when the buffer is unsaved\n. Hi @noirbizarre \nI added support for this requested feature in the commit 46d7222a8dad5c4a19b7f37446910835ab491306\nCan you check that is working as expected and close the issue?\nThanks.\n. I'll take care of all I can after the PyCon Ireland.\nRegards.\n. Can you tell me what is in your pylint_ignore setting?\n. Some update here?\n. I added a workaround to dont raise an exception here for that but you can be sure that is not a list what you have as your pylint_ignore config setting, you can in fact know what the problem is when you update to the last commit just checking the ST3 console.\nRegards.\n. I was aware of this one yesterday, I need some time to investigate it.\n. A big part of the legacy SublimeLinter is inherited from the old Sublime Lint and through it works, it really sux, for example the regular expressions used all around does not work, as an example of that just this Twisted transport being linted cos the \"port\" variable was not defined (transPORT).\nI will ride some day in remove all the legacy code that I can from the plugin cos is really of poor quality (even if it does the job)\n. I can't reproduce it.\n$ pip search pylint              \npylint                    - python code static checker\n  INSTALLED: 0.26.0\n  LATEST:    1.0.0\n$ tail -f .cache/jedi/anaconda/anaconda_jsonserver.log \n2013-09-29 13:14:37,364: INFO    : Incomming connection from ('127.0.0.1', 52872)\n2013-09-29 13:14:41,130: INFO    : client requests: run_linter\n2013-09-29 13:15:11,572: INFO    : client requests: run_linter_pylint\n2013-09-29 13:15:59,367: INFO    : client requests: run_linter\n2013-09-29 13:16:00,605: INFO    : client requests: run_linter\n2013-09-29 13:16:59,044: INFO    : client requests: run_linter\n2013-09-29 13:17:01,440: INFO    : client requests: run_linter\n2013-09-29 13:17:08,248: INFO    : client requests: run_linter\n2013-09-29 13:17:16,573: INFO    : client requests: run_linter_pylint\n2013-09-29 13:17:18,182: INFO    : client requests: run_linter_pylint\n2013-09-29 13:17:46,903: INFO    : client requests: run_linter_pylint\n2013-09-29 13:17:48,010: INFO    : client requests: run_linter_pylint\n. You were totally right.\nThanks!\n. Hi.\nThe config files are already JSON files, you can completely configure anaconda behaviour configuring your Sublime Text project file so you will be able to generate your .sublime-project file with whatever configuration you need for anaconda in the \"settings\" section. This fit your needs?\n. I'll see what I can do.\n. Hi.\nMost of the options are already reloaded by the plugin. The only things that normally you can't change \"in hot\" is just the interpreter you are using and the extra paths. \nI understand your use case is just that one, you need the plugin detects project switches or changes in the intrepreter/extra_paths and reload the JsonServer to update those changes.\nI am not sure if ST3 fires some kind of event on project switch, I don't think so, but even if it doesn't I don't thik thats a feature that can't be implemented, it just requires time.\nGive me more details about your specific needs.\n. Sorry for the delay but I've been really busy those last weeks with other projects. I will push in a few a new version that resolves this issue.\nRegards.\n. Hi.\nI need the full logs, seems like there is some problem with the Jedi library itself:\n2013-10-10 20:05:41,281: ERROR : The underlying Jedi library as raised an exception\n2013-10-10 20:05:41,282: ERROR : 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 24-25: ordinal not in range(128)\nCan you provide me the full logs?\nThanks\n. Hi.\nCan I have a copy of the lines of code that you are trying to auto complete when you get this Unicode exception?\n. Hi @abcat \nI suggest you to open a ticket about this in Jedi library project, it deserves to be fixed.\nRegards.\n. Hi.\nFirst of all, thank you very much for using Anaconda, and for want to contribute with a donation to the project, thats great.\nI can add a PayPal button to the README.md file if you wish.\nThanks.\n. Done :)\n. Hi again.\nI was lookig deeper on this problem and seems like there is some kind of problem with Sublime Text itself. I added some print lines to the autocompletion command and this is what I get:\nimport d\n    [['datetime\\timport', 'datetime'], ['dbhash\\timport', 'dbhash'], ['dbm\\timport', 'dbm'], ['decimal\\timport', 'decimal'], ['decorators\\timport', 'decorators'], ['Dialog\\timport', 'Dialog'], ['difflib\\timport', 'difflib'], ['dircache\\timport', 'dircache'], ['dis\\timport', 'dis'], ['distutils\\timport', 'distutils'], ['DLFCN\\timport', 'DLFCN'], ['doctest\\timport', 'doctest'], ['docutils\\timport', 'docutils'], ['DocXMLRPCServer\\timport', 'DocXMLRPCServer'], ['doublex\\timport', 'doublex'], ['downloads\\timport', 'downloads'], ['dumbdbm\\timport', 'dumbdbm'], ['dummy_thread\\timport', 'dummy_thread'], ['dummy_threading\\timport', 'dummy_threading']]\nimport da\n    [['datetime\\timport', 'datetime']]\nThe plugin send back the possible completion words but for some reasson the editor does not popup the dialog. I am afraid that there is not much more that I can do, I am so sorry.\n. Hi @groug \nThe behaviour that you are experiencing is different that the one experienced by @brainsik, I am being not able to reproduce your problem myself.\nCan you give us more information?\nOperating System\nSublime Text 3 build\nAnaconda Settings\nBtw, are you using dot autocompletion? https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda#autocompletion-on-dot\n. If package control is not listing anaconda, uninstall package control and install it again, it will solve it.\nI am using Ubuntu 13.10 64bits with the same ST3 build than you here in the work and I am not able to replicate your problem.\nCan you create a gist with your anaconda configuration and paste the URL here?\nThanks.\n. Ok.\nI will try to disable my dot completion and replicate the problem in order to fix it.\nThanks for your report.\n. Hi guys.\nI am reopening this one :(\n. @brainsik did you check this one? Can I close it?\n. I can't reproduce it anymore :/\n. Hi @zxcbryanfury \nYou can try to copy this file from anaconda into your User package https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/Completion%20Rules.tmPreferences\nLet me know if that solved the problem.\n. Hi guys.\nSublime Text 3 Python default package decide to cancel the autocompletion when some words are detected (for example def or class) but it also decides to cancel it with the word \"import\".\nTo fix that behavior and make ST3 use the anaconda's completion create a new Python directory in your Packages directory and copy the contents of the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/master/Completion%20Rules.tmPreferences there.\nIt will solve the issue.\nP.S: I will add this to the README in the next release.\n. @zxcbryanfury glad to see that your problem is gone. Thank you, at least is the best sublime python plugin that I ever wrote :)\n. It took a while to figure it out why the Completion Rules weren't working :)\n. I don't think so. I maintained this open as this is a Sublime Text 3 problem itself, so it can't be solved directly from anaconda's implementation. A workaround is not a fix.\n. Thats curious as the thread OP confirmed that the workaround fixed his problem, not sure how to help you here.\nBtw, if you are not using autocompletion in [dot] yet I suggest you to do it: http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/IDE/#toc_3\n. Are you sure? I just tested it in a fresh ST3 3086 installation in Ubuntu 15.04 and it works fine.\n.

Hi again @patrys \n\nI installed your plugin and played a bit around with it and although I really like its simplicity I am afraid that it needs to be improved a lot to could be integrated in anaconda.\nThings that have to improve:\n- The plugin is so strict it doesn't support any type of customization or configuration. For example, I really dislike gutter marks, in anaconda everything that is shown in the GUI is totally configurable.\n- It's totally synchronous and blocks the GUI, everything in anaconda runs asynchronous, in this way, anaconda never block the Sublime Text 3 GUI, this is a main requirement in anaconda, PythonChecker blocks the GUI\n- Is not able to LAYT (Lint As You Type)\n- Can't handle more than one error per line\n- It's lacking common features, (errors list, navigation, possibility to disable the linting, disable on certain files...)\n- It uses subprocesses in order to lint with custom python interpreters and create temporal files in the user file system that has to be cleaned again and again and slow down the whole process\nI really liked the simple and clean approach.\nRegards.\n. Hi\nWhen I spoke about configuration I mean about how the plugin plays with the GUI, the underline and gutter mark is what you like, but not necessarily what other people likes.\nAbout the blocking UI, not really. The plugin is calling subprocess.check_output and that call is blocking the python interpreter in the plugin_host process, what ST does when you use \"whatever_async\" in the API is just run that query in another thread of execution at the C++ level but if you block the interpreter you are blocking the interpreter it doesn't matters.\nTo don't block the GUI you have to run your blocking calls in asynchronous way using python threads. You can make the test, create a file with syntax errors and copy & paste it until you get 10000 lines of code, then lint it with PythonCheker and try to move around the file with the arrow keys, you get freezed for several seconds, then try with anaconda.\nBtw, the only way to run subprocesses asynchronous is using pipes and windows doesn't like that too much.\nRegards.\n. Anaconda runs an asynchronous client/server architecture, it never blocks nothing ever, all the linting, autocomplete, get docs, etc tasks runs in a separate (and asynchronous) python server that can process several requests at the same time.\nThe built client in anaconda doesn't wait until the request is processed it just fire and forget and then a handler process the lint or autocompletion or whatever when it is available to be used in the editor.\nIn your case and as you are using subprocesses, you can't request asynchronous to the subprocess so you are always forced to use python threads that are limited by the GIL as you already know.\nRegards.\n. I already refactored big part of SublimeLinter code before was much much worst, anaconda does not uses all the delayed unusable and totally wrong queue for example and I removed a lot of not needed/unclear code.\nI am still using the Errors, Warnings, Violations classifiers but I am not really sure why I am doing its maybe a good start point to make the legacy code that anaconda inherited from SublimeLinter simpler.\nBtw anaconda supports PyLint as transparent replacement for PyFlakes and that makes it a bit more complex as well.\nRegards.\n. PythonChecker project seems to be pretty much dead so I am closing this for now.\n. I know.\nJust because this the comment for this commit bea9c37577be3435e9df51635e602c9bb18f9330 is \"new JsonServer is loaded on project switch detection, this is a workaround for issue #85, more work is needed\"\nrelated to #85 \n. Nothing to be sorry about.\nRegards.\n. HI @staticaland \nThank you for your feedback. I will investigate this problem as soon as I have some time in the next weeks.\nRegards.\n. I guess your JsonServer is crashing.\nCan you paste the log from your AppData/jedi/jedi//anaconda_server.log file?\n. Yup\nYou have some of your binary installed python modules binded to the wrong version of Python (Module use of python26.dll conflicts with this version of Python.).\nTry to reinstall the modules or libraries that are giving you the problem (or everything) for Python2.7 and uninstall everything else for other Python versions if you don't really needed.\nRegards,\n. Then this is totally beyond the responsibilities of JsonServer and you found a bug in Jedi library itself. I suggest you to open a ticket in the Jedi repository linking to this issue and explaining there what the problem is.\nThere is no way to ignore specific modules and I am extremely busy those days to code it quick.\n. I am sorry I can't be more helpful on this one, I am going to commit a new version with a workaround that prevents the JsonServer to die when there is some problem in the Jedi library so you can continue using the plugin even if some autocompletion and stuff is not working.\n. Hi @hepi \nUpdate to the last version and restart your Sublime Text 3. \n@daniele-niero the jsonserver shouldn't crash at all even if the jedi library is raising exceptions. Can you start it in debug mode to check this?\nRegards.\n. Hi.\nThe JsonServer log is empty. Btw, this is too curious because the\njsonserver does not create any data structures in memory it just runs and\nfire I never noticed this problem in my own machine.\nWhich version of the interpreter have you configured?\nOn Nov 5, 2013 8:52 AM, \"flomertens\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI have found that lately anaconda jsonserver is eating memory pretty fast\nI have logged the memory usage while working:\nMemory usage: http://pastebin.com/XYBSHGvE\njsonserver log: http://pastebin.com/index.php?e=1\nTell me if you need more information from me.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/97\n.\n.

I just tried again using GTK and I got the same result than before.\nI noticed you have several extra_paths maybe there is something adding rubbish to the global namespace but if you look at the JsonServer code nothing is referenced we just instantiate a new Doc command handler that fire the needed Jedi methods and call the callback (that is self.return_back in JsonServer that just send the data back through the socket). \nCan you try to remove your extra paths and try again?\n. Ok, lets try something else.\nEdit your anaconda configuration with this:\n\"jsonserver_debug\": true,\n\"jsonserver_debug_port: 9999\nGo to $HOME/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda and start the JsonServer manually with:\npython -B ./anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p debug 9999 DEBUG\nNow restart your sublime text 3 and anaconda will now connect to the DEBUG server, hopefully we will get more information about what is happening.\n. I still can't reproduce that. \nEven in your case, that call to the doc function on GTK returns nothing:\nAbout push back to ST3: {\"doc\": \"No docstring for \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNo docstring for \", \"uid\": \"8ce7bd22ecab4f3eb061cdfb8d530e8b\", \"success\": true}\nIn my case it returns nothing and the memory consumption remains the same.\nI will let you know if I am able to replicate the problem in my work machine tomorrow (Ubuntu 13.10)\nRegards.\n. Good news @flomertens finally I reproduced it (not with this huge amount of memory of yours).\nWill be solved in the next commit. Thank you for your feedback this was a really hidden bug in the JsonServer.\nRegards.\n. I have good and bad news.\nFirst the good one: There is no memory leak in anaconda\nThe bad one: Is the normal behavior in Jedi\nWhen you import gtk and run any jedi related feature (autocompletion, goto, find usages, documentation), Jedi load the whole library and cache it on memory. Seems that can't be configured at all.\nI added a call to the Jedi clean cache library after each command is executed, it will delete any \"unused\" cache, seems like the impact is not too much but I see better numbers in my pidstat.\nThe really good new is it doesn't grow more (really seems like gtk import everything in the library when you just do import gtk, that is a really bad design, PySide for instance does not have this behavior).\nI'm sorry to can't be more helpful here.\n. Hi @highend\nMaybe there is some memory leak on anaconda that only affects Windows cos I have running it for weeks on my Linux boxes with no problems.\nLet's try to get some information. Anaconda uses external process that do all the hard work. The process should be identified in Windows as a regular python.exe process, this is the process that lint autocomplete and do everything else.\nThe plugin host should be really just doing really light stuff.\nCan you monitor the anaconda python process as well?\nCan you disable/uninstall everything else and check again?\nCan you take a look at %APP_DATA%/jedi/jedi/your_project_name/anaconda_jsobserver.log?\nCan you take a look at your ST3 console logs?\nRegards\n. Did you noticed the same memory drain on this portable version with just anaconda installed on it?\n. Hi guys.\nI've been working on that but I am not able to replicate this problem myself, I am using Windows 7 x64 with ST3 3059 and the last version of Anaconda and my plugin_host.exe process does not grow at all.\nI test it with both portable and installable versions and both 32 and 64 bits. I am running Package Control and Anaconda with no more plugins.\nI have to be able to replicate this behaviour in order to fix it but I am not so I need more information.\nIs the memory usage growing in a consistent way?\nWhat are you doing when memory usage grows?\nIt grows even if you are not using the ST3 editor at all?\nAnything else that you can think about?\n. Hi\nI detected some sort of memory growing on plugin_host related with the linting part of the plugin (that is in big part inherited code from Sublime Linter itself) but I am not able to replicate the memory growing with no open views.\nI will work on this problem until it get fixed, I will come here eventually to ask you to update anaconda version and test the bug that I can't replicate myself.\nRegards.\n. Hi again.\nI have two news, one is good and the another one is really bad.\nLet's start with the good one. I found the memory leak.\nThe bad one is that the memory leak is in Sublime Text itself so there is nothing that we can do to solve it (at least without a lot of pain and suffering).\nPlease, follow the following steps to confirm that I am right:\n1) Remove any plugin in your ST3\n2) Close ST3\n3) Open ST3\n4) Start monitoring the RAM used by plugin_host\n5) Open the ST3 console\n6) Write the following line and press enter: [sublime.active_window().active_view() for i in range(100000)]\n7) Your memory usage will grow like 30M\n8) Let me know if I am right (I know I am)\nRegards\n. Yes, but I am investigating deeper about the problem, seems like if you run the garbage collector manually, it get collected almost all the new allocated memory but you have to collect it manually (and it doesn't collect all the memory, some kilobytes are still leaked)\n. Hi guys.\nI just refactored critical parts of the plugin. Seems like ST3 leaks memory when the \"thread safe\" _async API methods are used or you just run code in a separate thread created with the standard threading library. The garbage collector of the embedded ST3 Python interpreter is not able to collect variables that are out of scope in local frames created on those threads.\nThat affected anaconda quite seriously as the plugin is totally event driven and asynchronous, I had to modify really critical parts of the plugin that are related with the speed and performance of the linting process. I still feel the plugin much more faster than other plugins out there but we lost some speed in the process.\nPlease, take a look at the last commit and report anything that doesn't work (I use auto-completion and linting only so I didn't tested every anaconda feature).\nI also tested the changes on my Linux box only so is quite possible other implementations are partially break.\nLet me know how you feel the plugin now.\nRegards.\n. Rename feature never worked quite well so nevermind it\n. I don't see why not, as everything else in anaconda it can be enabled through configuration and disabled by default. I just need the time to take a look on it.\n. Hi @flipphillips \nThe python interpreter that you configure for anaconda does not have any effect or impact on the python interpreter that the build system is using, they are two separate things. If you want to change your build system to use your Enthought Canopy installation you can just add a new build system in Tools -> Build System -> New build system with the following content:\n{\n    \"shell_cmd\": \"/Users/flip/canopy/bin/python -u \\\"$file\\\"\",\n    \"file_regex\": \"^[ ]*File \\\"(...*?)\\\", line ([0-9]*)\",\n    \"selector\": \"source.python\"\n}\nRegards.\n. Well, it should be really cool, but Sublime Text doesn't give us an API to can do that.\n. Sure.\nAdd \"E401\" to the \"pep8_ignore\" list of ignored errors in your anaconda/project configuration.\n. Oh sorry, I totally misunderstood your question.\nThere is no way yet to ignore that on PyFlakes, but I will look at this as soon as I have some time to do it.\n. My pleasure :-)\nOn Nov 21, 2013 8:32 AM, \"mkuhn\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks a lot for this speedy addition of new functionality!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/100#issuecomment-28965635\n.\n.

Hi @puredevotion \nWell, define a variable as \"global\" in the Global scope is a syntax error so I guess your code is not exactly like the one that you pasted above.\nI just wrote this code in and it works as expected:\n``` python\noutput_file = ''\ndef init(rNgram_file=\"ag.txt\", rOutput_file=\"ag.json\"):\n    global output_file\n    output_file = rOutput_file\ndef write_to_file():\n    global output_file\n    with open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:\n        outfile.write()\n```\n. I guess that's because you didn't assign it a value:\npython\nglobal variable  # not linted\nglobal variable = 10  # linted as syntax error\n. Hi @Ahmad-Dukhan, I need more information to try to help you solve this problem.\nThere is no other errors in the console?\nAre you sure the configured python interpreter is on the system?\nThere is some log in your $HOME/.cache/jedi directory?\nIf you don't configure a virtualenv path, anaconda works as expected?\nRegards.\n.

Hi @kurtontheway \nIs hard to know what is going on, seems like the JsonServer is crashing and trying to start again using the same port than the dead version was used (that is still in pending state by the operating system).\nAhmad solved starting Sublime Text as root (not sure why that solved the issue), is probably that the problem is related with the embedded version of Python being used by Maya3D, but I have no way to test that.\n. Done in the last commit.\n. Hi.\nWe need more information:\nOperating System\nPython Interpreter\nConfiguration Options\nSublime Text Console Logs\nAnaconda JsonServe Logs\n.

I see, \nCan you open a ticket in the Jedi project referencing this one and the gist with the error that you get?\nI will try to make some changes to prevent anaconda jsonserver from crash.\n. Hi @augusto2112 \nCan you update your anaconda version to the last commit and check if JsonServer still crashes?\nThanks\n. Great!\n. Hi\nThe linting marks are split in three groups: Errors, Warnings and Violations, I don't use gutter marks myself but every error/problem is appended to one of those categories and then the gutter related code (that is an addition from one of the anaconda users, I didn't wrote the code myself as I don't use it) print those icons depending of the severity of the errors/problems.\nWhat I mean is that there is no an easy way to add another icon for PyFlakes warnings as the gutter mark related code doesn't know anything about pyflakes or pep8 it only knows about errors, warnings and violations. \nI am in holidays, when I came back i will take a look at the gutter mark code as I am not really much familiar with it but if you want to take a look before that fell yourself more than welcome.\nRegards.\n. @Kos \nThis has been added to the development branch that will be released soon.\n. Use a Python3 interpreter and add the directory where your sublime text's plugin files are as external path in your project configuration.\nThat's just what I do to develop anaconda itself.\n. Duplicate of #97 \n. @cloudysapa I will close this one, take a look at #97 \n. Hi.\nThis is already implemented. this is part of the configuration file:\n``` json\n   /\n        If you set the following option as true, anaconda will display the\n        signatures of the methods you are using while typying\n    /\n    \"display_signatures\": false,\nIf you set it as true, you will get the fuction signature information in the status bar.\n```\n. Can I see an screenshot of that?\nThanks.\n. And this triggered by itself or with some kind of key combination? It looks pretty annoying (for me at least).\n. Hi.\nDo you know about anaconda's Super+D key shortcut to get documentation on the method, func or class your cursor is on?\nTry it and tell me if it suits your needs.\n. There is no image in your previous comment\n. Is should be more like.\n\n. This CloseKey is not returning any doc because your configured python interpreter can't see that winreg package.\nI don\u00b4t know about this feature as we would use a feature (autocompletion) for another totally different purpose that may interfere with normal anaconda autocompletion process and you may complete your code with lines from this documentation as well.\nI will really love to know about other users opinions about that feature.\n. Did you try to set to true the display_signatures option in the configuration?\n. Thank you for your contribution.\nIt seems like Jedi is recreating/loading the cache, I never seen this behaviour in Linux\n. If I understand well, what this will do is change the python interpreter in the project file?\n. Ups\n. Hi,\nAnaconda was never intended to be a \"vagrant\" solution, the vagrant integration that we support is just for linting/completion purposes out of the box using vagrant environments. We already support some vagrant commands (take a look at https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Using-Vagrant-commands).\nSaid that, I don't think \"integrate\" that sublime-vagrant project is a good idea, looking at the code it seems like the most critical parts of the plugin that are spawn processes in asynchronous way IMHO are totally overengineered and the approach is just overcomplex.\nIn the other hand, implement new vagrant commands should be pretty straighforward in anaconda, just take a look at the vagrant up command for example:\n``` python\nclass VagrantUp(VagrantBase):\n    \"\"\"Start a vagrant box\n    \"\"\"\ndef __init__(self, callback, vagrant_root, machine=None):\n    super(VagrantUp, self).__init__(callback, vagrant_root, machine)\n    self.start()\n\ndef run(self):\n    \"\"\"Start the vagrant box machine\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self.wait_answer(['vagrant', 'up', self.machine])\n\n```\nAdd a new command should be as simple as this one. Add more vagrant commands (and test it) is a bit out of my planning now as I have too much in my plate, not only with Anaconda as I contribute and maintain several other Free Software projects.\nI think this task is easy enough to encourage other anaconda users (at the end of the day all of us anaconda users are python developers right?) to involve themselves in the project and contribute with some code and feature additions. A free software project is as good as it's community is.\nSupport other vagrant commands is something that can be done, but if no other one take it, it will wait.\n. Of course you can :)\n. Hi.\nTake a look here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PdbSublimeTextSupport\nAnd here: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=5290\nI never used pdb to debug the plugin I always use print/logging statements and then check the output in the ST console as debug it with pdb can be a pain in the ass (I don't even know if is possible in ST3).\n. Hi.\nThat is relatively simple to implement, let me get some time to do it (or if anyone else want to implement that, he/she is more than welcome).\n. Hi.\nI already implemented just what you described when I was contributing with SublimeRope for ST2 just because rope supported this feature just caching the python environment (that not always worked). Jedi, in the other hand, does not support anything like that, I mean, there is no easy way to implement such a feature (at least using Jedi).\nUnfortunately I don't have all the time that I want to dedicate to the Open Source projects that I am involved on, this feature can be implemented in other ways as well, but all of them are time consuming and I don't have the time right now.\nAs always, if someone have the time to implement such a feature, he/she is more than welcome to contribute with the project, otherwise, it has to wait.\n. Hi guys, this has been added to the roadmap into #224 I am closing this issue now, you can track #224 as new autoimport is going to be one of the major enhancements of the next anaconda release.\n. Thanks.\n. I didn't experienced that but I will take a look. BTW, use the \"Disable linting on this file\" through the command palette so you don't need to close the file as it will not being linted any more.\n. Hi again.\nThis issue was introduced on commit https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/commit/47ce3dd8c3c17a49609f636274cddd564ecee4e2 because we were forced to modify the way that critical parts of the linting process works to prevent memory leaks on ST3 itself.\nThe problem is related with the \"always\" linting behavior of Anaconda, I have to figure out how to solve it but should be solved sooner than later.\nRegards.\n. Fixed :)\n. You can force the upgrade through Package Control, just use the \"Upgrade Package\" using your Command Palette. I'm not sure if package control has to update some kind of cache to be aware of the change.\n. Thanks for the suggestions, as you already noticed, I am not native English speaker.\n. Sorry but I can't reproduce it.\nIs working for me using whatever file as config entry point. I test it ignoring \"E501\" (line too long) with positive results.\n. I don't think so but I can't be sure.\nWhich other plugins do you have installed?\n. Glad to know that it is solved at least.\n. Hi \nTake a look here: https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html#recipes\n. Why you don't directly pull a request with the needed changes?\n. Merged\n. Hi\nThis is an already know (and reported) bug in Jedi.\nTake a look at https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/331\n. This bug is already fixed on Jedi library, I will merge this fix on Anaconda when David release it in the stable branch.\n. This has been fixed in version v0.8.1 of Jedi, we are actually using v0.8.1-5-gcd648e9 so this should be fixed in Anaconda as well.\n. Sorry man I totally forgot about this pull request.\n. Hi.\nThis is a regular logging message is not an error or a warning, you can safely ignore it.\n. Hi.\nThank you for your feedback, about the underline, I have to check the code I will let you know anything about this. About the information, well, unfortunately, Sublime Text doesn't allow us to use tooltips, if you click on the line, you get a proper error string in the status bar of your Sublime Text.\n. Are you sure your ST is using the last version of anaconda?\n. Hi.\nThis looks like a graphic weird bug in sublime text itself.\nWhich operating system is that?\n. My iMac came today so write down a list of plugins that you are using, I will test it myself on the weekend.\n. I hope you are not using SublimeLinter to lint python code :)\n. I installed the same plugins and it doesn't happens in my OS X. I am not able to reproduce it\n. Hi.\nThis can be caused by two different problems.\n1) Jedi doesn't handle docstrings from panda package properly\n2) Anaconda doesn't handle property the processed docstring from panda package\nDo you have any problem with autocompletion?\n. Hi @Twizzledrizzle \nSeems like Jedi (the underlaying library that anaconda uses to retrieve docstrings) doesn't handle the docstring in a proper way. There are some reports about problems with pandas (and numpy as well) in the Jedi project.\nI am afraid that there is no much that I can do.\n. Sure.\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/anaconda_server/commands/doc.py\nAnyway the problem is in the jedi library itself but if you can do something it will be great.\nThanks.\n. Hi.\nYou first need to understand how anaconda works. Anaconda is a 100% event driven plugin, that means everything is running asynchronous through a custom asynchronous socket client that I wrote.   \nThe Worker class is just a commodity abstraction that we use to fire tasks and wait for callbacks. I don't have time now but write an email in the mailing list I will try to explain you more when I get some time.\n. Do you have the linting option disabled globally or per project settings?\n. Ok, I will take a look to try to reproduce it as soon as possible. \n. Hi @wrsaunde \nCan you please confirm that this issue is fixed in the last commit?\nThank you.\n. You can add the following lines of code to the bottom of your tests file:\npython\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\nAnd then use Command+B and Sublime will execute all your tests. Tell me if that is enough for you.\n. I'll see what I can do.\n. Hi @drewcrawford \nTake a look at this plugin https://github.com/jpellerin/PythonTestST3\n. Thanks.\n. Feature added to the plugin, documentation can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Using-test-runner\n. Hi @tsaylor \nI don't think that work. Have you tested this? Btw, currently the errors list is ordered by error severity and not by line.\n. Hi @tsaylor \nI just check your branch in OS X and it's not working, it always returns the same line, I experimented the same behaviour on Linux this morning.\n. Hi @tsaylor \nTo be honest, the list is ordered by severity because I was too lazy to implement it properly and order it by line (as I think everyone expect it).\nYour solution seems to be working properly now, so I am going to merge it into the master. Thank you for your contribution.\n. Hi.\nNot really, the only thing that you have to do is just press whatever key in the buffer and it will be automatically cleaned by the linter process. This behaviour is because the plugin runs asynchronous. It can be forced to run the linter again to just clean the current buffer, I'll take a look tomorrow.\n. Btw, which operating system are you using? The weird thing is that it works as expected on Linux.\n. I am using the same ubuntu version in my computer at work and it works as expected but is not in my OS X\n. I just restarted ST3 and the command start working as expected again, no clue I am going to mark it as not replicable\n. Hi @giampaolo \nI fixed this last problem that you wrote about, it was related with the ST3 memory leak fix some months ago: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/97#issuecomment-31624102\nLet me know is it's fixed for you in the last commit\n. Hi @giampaolo \nI worked into those two problems and I think I solved both even if I couldn't replicate the first one (disable linting not working) in my Linux box (same version of Ubuntu than you).\nI need you perform the following tests using the last commit:\n1) Do the same that you did when you got the non python file linted and confirm that is not happening anymore\n2) Disable linting in one file and if the linted lines doesn't disappear by themselves, select another buffer and then select that buffer again.\nIf everything is ok, please, close this issue and enjoy anaconda in your ST3.\nThanks.\n. It will work if you just change to another tab and come bqck\nOn 27 Mar 2014 13:02, \"giampaolo\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nNote: when I click on \"disable linting for this file\" the linting is not\ndisabled.\nIn order to be disabled I need to release the focus windows (e.g. click on\nsome other window) then get back to sublime window.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/136#issuecomment-38799351\n.\n.

I will take a look at this request as soon as I have some time to do it\n. This has been already implemented by @naro in #140 \n. Are you sure you have configured a Python3 interpreter in your project/anaconda config file?\n\n\n. Hi @tildebyte \nI don't totally understand this report as I don't know what you mean with:\n\nProcessing has a large number of methods and keywords (highlighted/completed in a syntax-specific ST plugin) which are unknown to pyflakes.\n\nPyFlakes should be able to lint whatever your configured interpreter can see/understand, a part from that, what UndefinedLocal does is raise a warning when a local name in a nested scope shadows a global declared variable in an enclosing scope.\nI think what you want to use is UndefinedName, anyway, make sure you have configured your interpreter in the right way using the \"python_interpreter\" user setting correctly because if your python interpreter is able to understand those \"large number of methods and keywords\" PyFlakes should be able to do it as well if the configured interpreter for Anaconda plugin is the same.\n. You are welcome\n. Hi @naro \nThanks for your contribution with anaconda, I really appreciate it. Please, take care of the lines that I commented on and commit again.\nDon't forget to write a new comment when you do that as Github doesn't warn me about new commits to already posted pull requests.\nRegards.\n. Hi @mdalpi \nI couldn't replicate the behavior in my Linux box, I will try to replicate it in my OS X this evening.\n. Hi again.\nI just test it in my OS X and seems like I can replicate it some times but some other times it works just fine. I think is related with the project switch and the auto lint delay that we had to implement using delay callbacks from ST3 itself to fix the ST3 memory leak some months ago.\nI'll investigate this but I think this is going to be a hard one.\n. Hi @mdalpi \nSeems like sometimes ST3 itself returns false positives on files not being Python, is not related with Python3 itself. I will take a look on that hopefully this evening.\n. I fixed several things here, please, take a look\n. Hi @RonnyPfannschmidt \nAnaconda use PyFlakes no flake8\n. Hi\n'# noqa' works for:\n| Error | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| E121 | continuation line under-indented for hanging indent |\n| E122 | continuation line missing indentation or outdented |\n| E124 | closing bracket does not match visual indentation |\n| E125 | continuation line with same indent as next logical line |\n| E126 | continuation line over-indented for hanging indent |\n| E127 | continuation line over-indented for visual indent |\n| E128 | continuation line under-indented for visual indent |\n| E129 | visually indented line with same indent as next logical line |\n| E131 | continuation line unaligned for hanging indent |\n| E501 | line too long (82 > 79 characters) |\n| E711 | comparison to None should be \u2018if cond is None:\u2019 |\n| E712 | comparison to True should be \u2018if cond is True:\u2019 or \u2018if cond:\u2019 |\n. Hi.\nUnused imports are linted by PyFlakes and it doesn't support noqa, is something that can be added but next release come with a real autoimport feature that will get rid of any unused import in your modules in automatic way (if you configure it to do it) so not sure how valuable is gonna be to add noqa for unused imports when they can be handled in automatic way on file save.\n. Hi.\nAs I said, that's something that can be added, the main problem is that PyFlakes doesn't support the # noqa flag at all and has to be implemented from scratch. \n. Slovenly\n. Thank  you for spot this bug, I don't use PyLint myself so I never catch this one.\n. Hi\nI don't really understand this. Is the ST3 that you are using running in the remote server or in your local machine?.\nIf the ST3 is running in the remote server, it doesn't have any sense that you get time out errors (that means the client couldn't connect to the JsonServer in the last half of a second) as the ST3 and the JsonServer are running in the same machine (localhost). \nEven if the files you are working on are in a remote server, it shouldn't affect anaconda behaviour so I don't really have an answer to this issue.\nBtw, I suggest you to don't use the debug mode as it is used for development purposes only and it doesn't work at all by himself (without manual work in the terminal) you can obtain unexpected results and strange behaviour.\n. Hi\nThe timeout is set here https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/anaconda_lib/worker.py#L79\nBtw, anaconda will not freeze your ST3 at all, not even in slow machines as it runs completely decoupled of ST3. All the linting/completion/IDE processes are performed in a standalone server (JsonServer defined in anaconda_server/jsonserver.py) totally independent of ST3 or the plugin_host processes. \nAnaconda sends a request to this server using an asynchronous client (defined in anaconda_lib/jsonclient.py), that means anaconda doesn't wait until the linting/completion/IDE task is done, it just fires and forget and continues running your ST3 like no call was made to the extension, when the JsonServer finish the task it return back the result and a callback is fired to handle the response.\nIn fact I ran anaconda in some Raspberry PI with no problems at all and Raspberry is a really slow system (I ran the JsonServer I mean). \nI never tried to run ST3 trough a Remote Desktop connection but I did in fact trough a VNC from my Linux box to my OS X with no incidences neither.\n. Hi @bcokert \nI just recorded a video showing that what you described is not the anaconda's behaviour at all, not even when it is set to \"save-only\".\nAnaconda Behaviour\nThere should be something else in that machine.\n. Ok.\nSeems to be a bug in PyFlakes itself when using Python 3.4 -> https://bugs.launchpad.net/pyflakes/+bug/1295554\n. It's not in the GitHub master -> https://github.com/pyflakes/pyflakes/blob/master/pyflakes/checker.py#L643\n. Please, check the last commit, it should resolve the problem\n. You're welcome\n. Hi @jasimmk, thanks for your contribution.\nIs really hard to think in every possible shortcut scenario in every Linux distribution and Desktop Environment. \n. Thanks for the report.\n. Hi\nFrom where that --indent-size option comes from? Modify 3rd party libraries as pep8 or autopep8 is always a bad idea as it makes harder the task of update them.\n. Anaconda is using version 0.9.4a0 of autopep8, seems like our version doesn't support that feature. Anyway, even if we update the autopep8 version, the pep8 library is going to lint all your lines as PEP8 violations and the only way to workaround that is modify the indentation function in pep8 itself  as the four spaces is hardcoded into this line if indent_char == ' ' and indent_level % 4:\n. I just updated the autopep8 library to the last version, so this option is now available but the problem of the pep8 library is there anyway.\nWhat do you think?\n. Hi @MaokaiLin \nDisplay Signatures works asynchronous as the rest of the extension, that means that is not probable you experience any type of typying slowdown with it. I can't in fact reproduce it myself.\n. I see.\nThanks.\n. Sublime Text API doesn't provide us with any way to create tooltips, this is why it is currently displayed in the status bar.\nMeaning that it's impossible to implement this enhancement.\n. Take into account that anaconda does not fires the linting process when the cursor is in a string so if for example the missing comma was separating a list of strings, if your cursor ends in the quote (or double quote) of the string, the linting process doesn't get fired.\nBy default, anaconda will try to fire the linter half a second after your last key push\n. Hi.\nI am afraid that this is one of those obscure bugs that Sublime Text has itself, if the linking process is not being fired is just because Sublime Text 3 is telling the extension that the part of the file where the cursor is is just not Python code.\n--\u00a0\nJoin the free software foundation and become free as in freedom\nOn 22 April 2014 at 20:40:59, K.-Michael Aye (notifications@github.com) wrote:\nOk, tried if that's the case, but it's not. I have this list where I can either remove or add a space before the second string without getting into the string, and still the linter is not fired:\ntstrings = ['2012070100', '2013010100']\nInterestingly, if the error of missing space after comma is marked, I then add a space and leave the curser after the added space but before the string, even a 'Save File' does not trigger the linter to remove the error marking.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Syntax coloring is applied only once in the file and then is just used by the theming template that you have configured. \nWe can try to open a issue at the ST3 but this is what is probably going to happen: https://github.com/SublimeText/Issues/issues/127\nI can just change the behaviour in Anaconda to try to workaround that problem but right now I don't have too much time to work on that.\nLeft this issue open so I can revisit when I have some time.\n. Please, retest this and close it if you are happy enough.\n. Hi @michaelaye \nAre you sure that you have installed last version of the extension? It works for me:\nhttp://youtu.be/Sfh4Us703Qs\n. I am so glad that this issue has been solved, ST reloads extensions if the\nmodified files are in the root directory of the plugin only that's why it\ndidn't worked for you before restarting.\nRegards.\nOn 24 Apr 2014 00:00, \"K.-Michael Aye\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nClosed #152 https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/152.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/152\n.\n. This is fixed now\n. It works for me, if you are using Python3 it's possible that etree is affected by this bug in Jedi library (it affects auto completion, get documentation, goto and find usags): https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/125\n. I updated it in the last commit \n. That is because anaconda is deactivated in SublimeREPL buffers, people complaint about Anaconda interfering with SublimeREPL in the past so this is why now is deactivated\n. Hi.\n\nThis is because anaconda executes this in the main thread to force the user to don't open another buffer while the process is being done (it can take a while). I can make it asynchronous, I will take a look on this later.\n. Hi.\nThis should be fixed in the last commit, please, take into consideration that when you run the autoformat command, the buffer that is going to be formated is turned into \"read only\" until the command finish. \nEven if the buffer is read only, you can still edit other buffers or even another windows, when the command is complete, the buffer that the command ran on will be reformated even if the window or the buffer is not active in that moment.\nI also improved the performance of the autoformat command a lot. Feel free to close this issue if you are satisfied.\n. @erbridge \nThis should be fixed since the last release https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/commit/d55249e3ad242023ca8d14177ae598dd76a762ca\nCan you confirm it and close this issue please? Thanks.\n. I am afraid that this will break a previous fix for OS X as described here #113, btw is never a good idea remove asleep(0.01) for a pass in a while as it will eat all your CPU making your ST3 totally unresponsive (and maybe your machine as well) in case of failures.\n. Hi @rahul-ramadas \nFirst of all, thank you for dedicate this time and effort to Anaconda. Said that.\nYou can make a simple test to see how use the async_ prefixes in ST3 make any plugin that uses them leak all the memory that is allocated by the frame stacks that are created on those async_ frames. \nAs far as I know, those frames run in different OS threads into C++ threads of the plugins_host process. I am pretty sure that this is dangerous as minimum, as I am not really sure how the GIL and the GC handles that (well, thats not true, I am pretty sure that the GC doesn't handles it at all as the local frames are referenced forever into the C++ process).\nYou can create a plugin with an async_ listener that allocate 1MB of memory in a local scope variable each second and o nothing with that, return None. Then monitorize the memory usage of your plugins_host, you are going to get astonished pretty fast.\nComing back to your last comment:\nLinting every 500ms: I suggest you to run the JsonServer in DEBUG mode or just tail the JsonServer logs in the jedi cache log directories to see how the linting process is not being called if you don't press any key (and you don't focus other views or save or load...).\nAsynchornous: Anaconda is 100% asynchronous, we don't need that async_ thing (that solves nothing btw, because if you block the python interpreter in your code, it doesn't matters if the call is running in the async_ C++ thread, all the plugins_host just hangs until the python interpreter is not blocked anymore (note for ST3 developers: this is because the GIL, you know about the GIL right?)). As you now, run a method in a thread, doesn't make it asynchronous, it just runs in a thread. \nLuckily I implemented asynchronous network I/O and this is why anaconda is real and 100% asynchronous, because it never waits to a response when it send something to the AsyncJson server (that run standalone as a independent process and is in fact the process that makes the linting and the completion). Take into account, that the Worker.execute call, returns immediately (after we have a valid and healthy client connected)  as the network request is real asynchronous (implementing just the select mechanism that is wide available (Win, Unix) and is fast enough for anaconda's needs). \nSaid that, I will speak now about why WORKERS_LOCK is there. This RLock is there not because I believe the plugin code is going to run in separate threads but because it can run just from different windows (and I don't know if those windows can make requests to the plugins_host concurrently as is not part of the API that we can control).\nUse an RLock is expensive enough by himself, I don't see the need to add the get_workers_lock method into the BaseWorker class, as you know, create a function frame in Python is not free and in this case the only thing that the function is doing is just use a global variable that is globally accessible in that module scope.\nI understand that add the locking on the reconnection is something logic to prevent more than one thread to alter the global state of the reconnecting variable, but in this case this is something that is not going to happen, in fact, I am pretty sure that we can get rid of the whole WORKERS_LOCK with no problem at all.\nJust let me know what you think about.\n. Hi.\nYou can try to re-add the _async again and monitor your ST3 while you work with it but we are speaking here of add an speed improvement of 0.5 secs when we first start the text editor. I am not sure if we are channeling our effort correctly here, maybe just take down the timeout for the connection is just enough.\nBeing honest, in my opino, this micro waiting until we have connection with the JsonServer is not a problem, leak memory due memory allocated on threads not being cleaned by ST3 is. To your example to leak, you have to run the body of the method in a separate thread.\n. Make a new pull request with just that change please. And thank you for being involved :)\n. It seems to be first line of the float type docstring :\n`````` python\n\n\n\nfloat.doc\n'float(x) -> floating point number\\n\\nConvert a string or number to a floating point number, if possible.'``\n``````\n. For some reason the status bar is not being cleaned after a call todisplay_signatures`, I don't use this feature myself so I never noticed.\n\n\n\nI will take a look\n. Hi\nI can't reproduce the problem myself. By the way, what you mean with \"autopep8 0.9.1? Anaconda should use the autopep '0.9.4a0' that is included with the plugin.\n. Hi\nI didn't had any change to look at this (or any other) issue lately. I will as soon as I have some time to do it but to properly test this I need the same buffer that you are trying to autoformat.\nIf this is not a problem, feel free to send it to me to the email address that you can find in my profile information and make sure that you refer this issue in the email so I can know what is the email about.\nRegards.\n. Hi.\nOther user sent me an example file that makes the problem appears, I am afraid the exception is happening very deep inside the autopep8 completion library, exactly in the patcomp module of the lib2to3 package.\nTo be honest, I have no clue why this is happening. I will update autopep8 library in the next days to see if that solves the problem and update it (as there are new versions)\n. I updated autoformat to the last version and now it seems to be working, close this issue if is working for you.\nThanks.\n. It's quite possible  that the plugin is not able to find your python\ninterpreter.\nBy default anaconda use the python interpreter that is in your PATH\nenvironment variable, make sure you have one configured and try again.\nOn 10 May 2014 08:17, \"andrewmetersky\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nStarted with a fresh install of ST3 and other packages that I use.

We can tell ST3 to mark the view as scratch but this doesn't solve the problem because the autoformat command is run in an external process and handled asynchronous so when it finish we already saved the buffer and then it gets modified again when we have a result back from the autoformat asynchronous call.\n. @erbridge and @NorthIsUp \nAgain, this should be fixed since the last release https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/commit/d55249e3ad242023ca8d14177ae598dd76a762ca\nPlease, confirm and close. Thanks.\n. This was fixed a couple releases ago\n. Yup I had to try several times until I could reproduce it\n. Hi.\nWhat you are trying to complete is not a file object but a string (as you are using for line in fd and fd is the file objec and line is the value of the iterationt), anyway, this also works.\n\n. You are right, I test that code using python 3.4.0 REPL and jedi directly (no anaconda, no ST3) and it doesn't give back any completion  while python 2.7.5 does.\nIt doesn't work with the in development version of jedi neither. I am going to open a ticket in the Jedi project itself about this problem.\n. Well, if you take a look at https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/listeners/completion.py#L37 you can see how we return back the flag to Sublime Text that is finally the one that is giving you back the list. \nThere is also snippets that should come back if ppl like them so the only thing that we can do is tell ST to don't add buffer completion, and is what we do.\n.

Hi\nIt's quite possible that this issue was fixed yesterday by @rahul-ramadas, can you confirm it please? \n. A pleasure\n. Much better.\n. Sure, right now there is only a check in the run_linter call, I think that will solve the problem.\n. Hi.\nThis is the right channel where to open issues like this one. You are right in that we don't update the releases notes since long ago, and we must improve on that but the Package Control policy of show the release notes on each push to master, is far beyond  stupid, not on each commit we want to make a \"release\" of anaconda.\nBut true, we should update the release notes when we are really releasing something.\n. Do you have configured a Python3 interpreter? \nBy default anaconda uses whatever \"python\" is installed in the system, make sure your configured interpreter is Python3 if you are programming in python3.\n. Hi.\nMake sure that your configured python interpreter is able to see the matplotlib library. By the way, are you using a python2 or python3 interpreter?\n. Hi.\nI see that you are using OS X, follow those instructions and give me the results please:\n1) cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_lib\n2) python\n3) from jedi import Script\n4) print(Script('import matplotlib\\nmatplotlib.').completions())\nBtw, take a look here, https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/418 seems like Jedi library has some problems with matplotlib itself.\nRegards.\n. Seems to be a well known problem in the Jedi library, it should be fixed as soon as Jedi project release a version that fix the problem.\n. This was fixed on jedi v0.8.1  so it should be fixed in Anaconda as well\n. Hi.\nI don't think the documentation fits in the autocomplete popup window, maybe just the signature (and not always), but the signature itself tell you nothing about the method, function, class or property itself.\nIt will make the autocompletion process slower as well, as we should iterate over all the completion proposals and get the documentation from each one before return a result to the ST3.\n.

Hi Rahul.\nThank you for sort this out by yourself and share with the community, I am being really busy lately.\n. I don't see any way to tell the build system to use the configured interpreter...\n. This may work but we have to think very carefully about introduce a feature that intrusive\n. This has been implemented in the development branch that is scheduled to be released tomorrow\n. Hi @kerryz \nYou can enable this behaviour in Anaconda activating the complete_parameters and complete_all_parameters in your configuration:\n```\n    /*\n        If complete_parameters is true, anaconda will add function and class\n        parameters to its completions.\n    If complete_all_parameters is true, it will add all the possible\n    parameters, if it's false, it will add only required parameters\n*/\n\"complete_parameters\": false,\n\"complete_all_parameters\": false,\n\n```\n. Hi @kerryz \nI see what you mean. Anaconda uses Jedi to offer autocomplete, unlike PyDev, Jedi doesn't pre-process and cache the PYTHONPATH, Jedi autocompletion is based in what you have imported in your scripts and as far as I know, it doesn't offer support to autocomplete method overriding in super classes.\nI suggest you to take a look at Jedi project repository issues track to discover if that is a proposed feature already and if not, propose there itself.\nYou can check the Jedi project in the link below:\nhttps://github.com/davidhalter/jedi\n. Hi.\nIt looks promising, let me take a look in detail when I get some time.\n. I merged this pull request into a new branch \"better_callbacks\" to test it\n. I updated the better_callbacks branch\n. I added some commits in the top of this request in the better_callbacks branch, I suggest you to close this pull request and work directly on the new branch.\n. Hi @ColtonProvias \nThis is an open issue in the Jedi project (anaconda uses jedi for the autocompletion, document viewer and other features) asking about this.\nYou can follow the issue in the link below:\nhttps://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/361\n. Hi @willbastian \nWe use the stable branch (that should be master) of jedi in anaconda. If you need this in your anaconda, just replace the jedi directory in anaconda_lib with the contents of the jedi's dev branch and restart Sublime Text 3, it should work fine.\n. Hi @willbastian \nWhich problem did you had with the dev branch? Is a bit concerning as someday it will be the stable branch.\n. Seems like they removed/renamed the function that clears the in-memory cache, not a big deal I think.\nThanks.\n. @abhinavk \nImplemented in the development branch, should be live in the new release\n. I remember that someone asked about a test runner in Anaconda some time ago. How this exactly works?\n. @NorthIsUp \nI just moved Callbacks to it's own module into anaconda_lib package and refactored it a bit, the interface is the same.\nI also added configurable timeout for timeouts in the autoformat feature.\n. Callbacks branch has been merged into master.\n. Any update here?\n. I'll test this today\n. Hi @NorthIsUp \nIt doesn't seems to work when using other test runners (like trial), I think it needs a bit of love, I will work on this during the weekend to integrate it with the rest of the plugin.\nThank you as always for your contribution.\n.

You gave me a fucking good idea by the way :)\n. @demon386 \nIs not really \"asynchronous\" is just being executed in threads (that should be blocked waiting I/O), Anaconda is a non blocking solution in both ends, the client and the server uses non blocking sockets.\nI suggest you to take a look at the Completion project https://github.com/quarnster/completion that brings clang to Sublime Text 3 using Go.\nAnyway, I have plans to bring more linting and completion for other languages into anaconda (anacondaPHP, anacondaRuby, anacondaJS, etc, etc) so I'll be in touch if the project goes on.\n. Hi.\nThat's pretty weird, seems like self.sock is not a socket when anaconda try to send data trough it? The sock property is the object returned by the call to socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) so I don't know what this can be if not a socket :). Try to gather more information about this please.\n. Any new on this one?\n. This has been added to the roadmap to version 2.0.0 in #227 I'll close this issue as it's resolution is wontfix\n. Hi.\nIs this happening consistently in the same file? If the answer is yes, can I have this file?\nThanks.\n. Ok.\nWhat can you tell me about the file? Are you using some Romanian non ASCII character for variable or function names?\nAre you using Python3 or Python2, which specific version?\nCan you edit your .config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py file and activate the DEBUG mode?\nThe output is located at $HOME/.cache/jedi//anaconda_jsonserver.log in your Linux machine.\nThanks.\n. Ok, don't hesitate to open it again if the problem comes back.\nRegards.\n. @iuliux \nI found the problem, is fixed in the development branch should be live in a couple of days.\n. @NorthIsUp \nDo you think is possible that you can use the mailing list to discuss those things? Then we can create an issue with something more concrete after we speak about the details.\nI am actually refactoring the JsonServer, you can take a look at the development branch (don't try to use the branch, is still under heavy development and pretty bugged).\n. Take a look at https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/93\n. I don't think is a good idea to run anaconda and SublimePythonIDE together. It never happened to me, try to reproduce it disabling SublimePythonIDE first\n. Can you paste any log from the ST3 console?\n. Perfect :)\n. You don't need to add the anaconda key there, should be:\n{\n    \"settings\": {\n        \"python_interpreter\": \"python34\",\n        ...       \n    }\n}\nPretty much as is detailed here: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda#python-interpreter-settings\n. That's ok, you can set whatever option that you need.\n. You just need to set the global anaconda linter as false\n{\n    \"settings\": {        \n        \"anaconda_linting\": false        \n    }\n}\nI guess that you want to use SublimeLinter instead. As an exercise, try the following, copy and paste a file of your choice (with some errors on it) and paste it lets say until you have 10.000 lines of code, ten try to write in that file with SublimeLinter, deactivate it and try to write with Anaconda I am pretty sure that you are going to be surprised.\n. @Haakenlid \nFirst of all, sorry for any inconvenience that this new feature caused to you. I am disabling it until I fix any weird behaviour.\nCan you provide some information?\n1) Which operating system are you working on\n2) Which build of sublime text\n3) Is there anything else  in the log before that \"Connection refused\"?\nThank you.\n. Anything in the console logs?\nThanks.\n. I can't reproduce it, I think is related with #196\n. Fixed\n. Hi.\nIf you take a look at the last commit version, it does just what you\ndescribed, for now, the full thing is disabled, the method just return\nwriting nothing.\nI will solve this problem today and make it optional as well.\nThanks.\nOn 17 Aug 2014 09:03, \"benkaraban\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAlso, if you don't have time to fix it, I can fix it myself and submit you\na patch.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/199#issuecomment-52416111.\n.

Can you provide more information?\nWhat problem are you experiencing?\nWhich version of python are you using for your interpreter?\nIs there any logs in the Sublime Text console?\nThanks.\n. Try to restart ST3 by the way\n. Please, try to restart Sublime Text and try again, if the problem persist just paste me another log.\nThanks.\n. Try now please, it will work fine.\nP.S: Of course you need the last commit of anaconda\n. It will be possible to totally supplant the native Sublime Text 3 build system and offer support for input but that is a huge task and a bit intrusive. Let's maintain this issue open to see what the community thinks about this.\n. Thanks, I fixed it in a similar more generic way.\n. Hi @txtsd \nThat's improbably, as everyone else is using the plugin with no problems (including me) can you give us more details about the problem?\nOperating System\nSublime Text 3 build\nPython version\nConsole Logs\nJsonServer Logs\nThank you.\n. The console log is on sublime text itself, View -> Show Console\nThe JsonServer logs should be in:\nC:\\Users\\AppData\\Roaming\\Cache\\Cache\\Jedi\\anconda_jsonserver.log\n. @txtsd \nPlease, set your auto_python_builder_enabled as false in your Anaconda settings file, this will stop that. \nI need a Windows 8.1 to test this, I will update this issue when I finally fix it and you can enable that option again.\nBtw, I need to know the value of your \"python_interpreter\" option value.\n. @txtsd \nI need to know the content of your \"python_environment\" variable in order to reproduce this bug, can you please tell me which is the content of this option?\nThank you.\n. Nope, I need to know which is the path of the python interpreter that you are using in your project. In your project settings file you should have something like:\n...\n     \"settings\": {\n         \"python_interpreter\": \"blah\"\n     }\nIf is not in your project settings should be settled globally, I need whatever is written down there.\n. It should be fixed in 1.2.8 \n. @AndreasBackx \nCan't reproduce it myself, can you give us more details?\nOperating System\nSublime Text 3 build\nPython Interpreter\nConsole Logs (maybe?)\n. @AndreasBackx \nI just tested that with:\nfrom uuid import uuid4, uuid1\nAnaconda lint the line as usual and add a red underline on uuid1 that is the one that is not being used in the file that I tested. Can you be more specific about what is the behavior that you expect?\nThanks.\n. Can you provide some kind of logs?\nThanks.\n. Ok, seems like windows version needs some love. I put this top in my list so I will try to reproduce and fix it in a Windows VM as soon as possible.\n. @valrus, @FreakyDug \nI am being testing this on a Windows 7 the whole morning and I have been able to reproduce it only when anaconda plugin got updated in my first ST3 startup, after close it and open it again, I couldn't reproduce it anymore.\nCan you confirm that is the same behavior in your case please?\n. @MichalPodeszwa \nUnfortunately, Sublime Text 3 doesn't expose any API to create popups. Anaconda already offer this feature using the status bar (the option is display_signatures, that is false by default).\nOther plugins create a kind of illusion of popup using the autocompletion box in order to try to pretend a popup with the arguments of the methods. They can do that cos they don't care if that breaks their autocompletion process but anaconda uses a continuous asynchronous autocompletion flow (that is why is smoother than any other ST3 completion plugin) and it will break it and interfere with the main task of the plugin.\nYou have several options while ST3 expose an API to create popups:\n1) The already mentioned display_signatures option\n2) Enable complete_parmeters or/and complete_all_parameters\n3) Use the anaconda documentation feature\nI understand why people ask for this feature but performance is the first goal of anaconda far above visual convenience hacks, we will add this feature as soon as ST3 provide us with a proper way to do it.\nThanks.\n. You are welcome :)\n. @steveoh \nIs possible that your configured \"python_interpreter\" is not set at all?\n. @montiniz \nIt's probably that this is totally unrelated to #23 and #21, look at /Users/montiniz/Library/Application Support/Caches/Jedi/<project_name>/anaconda_jsonserver.log for any Python exception in the JsonServer, if the problem persist, start your JsonServer in debug mode as explained here\nBtw, what were you doing when this was raised?\nWhich python interpreter do you have configured?\n. I think you have the jsonserver_debug set as true but you didn't started the server manually and then JsonSever process spawning in failing because there is already another server running in the same port.\nSet all the debug options to false, tail your log file, Command+Q Sublime Text and start it again. I can't help you further as I can't replicate this problem myself, everything is working fine forme using the same versions of everything. \n. Fixed\n. Hi @tbarbugli \nAnaconda uses the Python interpreter that is in your $PATH by default and is able to complete, or Go To, or find usages in anything that this interpreter can see. Is the linting working?\n. Any update here?\n. @drewcrawford \nI just tried with Python2 and Python3 interpreters and the linter doesn't lint E701 (or whatever other one) when I add them to the pep8_ignore list.\n. @drewcrawford \nI copy and paste it\n. Right now the behaviour is: the settings in the project hide the settings in general, that behaviour has sense for any other options, maybe for options that you can add a list of parameters your expectation is reasonable.\nLet me think about for a while.\n. I finally came with a conclusion for this.\nThe behaviour that you expect is a interesting one but there is always edge cases, for example, if someone want to ignore E501 in all projects but this someone is contributing to some open source project with strict style guidelines will not be able to don't remove the ignore for the E501 as it's already in the general configuration and the only way should be removing it from the general config what affects all other projects that he/she can be working on.\nSo my decision is to maintain the current behaviour: settings in projects hide outer levels.\n. There are three reasons why the autoformat ignores are separated from the pep8 linting ones.\n1) They are two different features, for example, I don't use autoformat at all. Pep8 is meant to be used to detect PEP8 violations and errors while AutoPEP8 is meant to automatically correct code that doesn't follow PEP8 (making use itself of the pep8 library in the process). Pep8 settings are meant to linting, autoformat settings are meant to autoformat files.\n2) You may ignore some rules while you are developing (for visual reasons or whatever) but you want to format your files before commit to a repository so lets say that you want to ignore E701 and E702 while programming but want to autoformat them, you need different set of options to be able to do that.\n3) Autoformat add some error codes that doesn't exists in pep8\n. This was already added some commits ago\n. @dralley \nI just test it using CPython 3.4.0 and it doesn't give me any warning\n\nAre you sure that you have configured the right interpreter?\n. You have to remove the brackets on the settings key, it's value should be a\ndictionary. Like.\n\"settings\": {\n    \" python_interpreter\": \"python3\"\n}\nOn 8 Sep 2014 23:42, \"Daniel Alley\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIf I set the interpreter inside the Anaconda settings, it works fine.

Can you confirm that this works for you and close the ticket please?\n. Hi @rajalokan \nI don't see any technical barrier that could impede us to implement an imports validation detector in Anaconda, as always, the only boundary is get the time to implement it.\n. This feature is next.\n. Hi\nCan you explain in deeper detail which problems did you encounter to configure Anaconda? In your first paragraph you said that you couldn't get Anaconda to recognize settings from your project file.\n. Hi @miohtama \nSorry for the delay, in general, all the configuration keys can be in three different places:\n- Anaconda.sublime-settings\n- User Settings\n- Project Settings\nIn the case of Anaconda and user settings, it goes directly in the main scope of the settings file. In the case of the project, it goes just inside the \"settings\" key.\n. @miohtama \nI added this section to the README file: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/README.md#where-to-place-anaconda-settings-options\n. Have to take a look at this as soon as possible, thanks for report.\n. Tagged to v1.3.5\n. Tagged to v1.3.6 \n. Fixed in fix218 branch, available in next release v1.3.6\n. Yeah, I already noticed about the print, is removed in my in-development version.\nThank you.\n. Hi @Kitefr \nSorry for the delay but I am really busy those days. There is no difference for Anaconda between a saved or an unsaved file, in fact, Anaconda just use the buffer text and not the file at all.\nLet me know if you still experience the problem so I can try to reproduce it (when I have some time).\n. Hi @Kitefr \nI am not able to reproduce this behavior in any of my Linux boxes (nor even in my OS X), I need more information.\nWhich operating system are you working on?\nWhich version of Sublime Text?\nWhich version of Anaconda?\nDo you have installed another Anaconda extension (like anaconda_php)?\nWhat is your configuration?\n. Let's try something.\nAdd this to your configuration and try again, let me know what happens:\njson\n{\n    \"python_interpreter\": \"/usr/local/bin/python\",\n    \"anaconda_linting\": false,\n    \"suppress_word_completions\": true,\n    \"suppress_explicit_completions\": true,\n}\nBy the way, the linting and the autocompletion processes, are isolated so one doesn't affect the other.\n. Hi\nNope, completion and linting are completely decoupled processes so they don't affect each other. I never had this problem (and I am the user zero). Maybe is related with your Sublime Text itself, no idea really.\n. Hi @nicolasbessou \nUnfortunately, the asynchronous custom socket that anaconda implements doesn't work totally fine on Windows, this is mainly because I am POSIX user so I don't use Windows myself and we don't have an active Windows maintainer.\nFor now, there is no solution to this problem, as it's present himself as totally non deterministic. I have plans of porting Tulip from Python 3.4 to Anaconda as its a much more robust asynchronous sockets implementation than my humble ioloop,py (that is way better than asyncore and asynchat on windows btw) and it will hopefully solve this kind of problems on Windows platform.\nMy knowledge about the Windows sockets implementation is not good enough as to propose a proper solution about this specific problem on Windows that as I already mentioned, is pretty non deterministic.\nThank you for your interest in improving anaconda.\n. I added the tag wontfix because this is not going to be fix until we don't add a more sophisticated sockets handlers for windows into the plugin. This doesn't means is never going to be fixed but that is not going to be fixed now.\nI close the issue as this change is in the roadmap.\n. Tagged for v1.3.5\n. Hi.\nTagged for next release\n. Partially implemented in https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/releases/tag/v1.4.25\n. http://damnwidget.gitbooks.io/anacondast3-developers-documentation/\n. Unfortunately I have no time to work on this at the moment\n. Tulip based event loops can't be implemented in ST3 as the ST3 interpreter is missing some C compiled modules.\nfrom ..anaconda_lib import asyncio\n  File \"/home/oscar/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_lib/asyncio/__init__.py\", line 21, in <module>\n    from .base_events import *\n  File \"/home/oscar/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_lib/asyncio/base_events.py\", line 18, in <module>\n    import concurrent.futures\n  File \"./concurrent/futures/__init__.py\", line 17, in <module>\n  File \"./concurrent/futures/process.py\", line 52, in <module>\n  File \"./multiprocessing/__init__.py\", line 58, in <module>\nImportError: No module named '_multiprocessing\nSo very bad news guys.\n. This is a bit messy it will make anaconda non trivial to use asking the user to install a package dependency in order to just make his/her anaconda plugin just to work. I don't really like the idea, I will think about an elegant solution to solve this problem.\nEDIT: Seems like ST3 should be able to autoload the dependency by himself but in my tests I couldn't achieve that result.\n. Hi\nWhat do you mean with \"stops marking the lines with PEP8 problems\"? Because if you mean that anaconda doesn't show the gutter marks at the left, this is because the Git plugin that you are using is hiding anaconda marks to show its own marks.\nBtw, that weird message that you make reference and it's shown in both screenshots is not from anaconda, but from another plugin that you have installed. It shows \"Anaconda:\" because they are using probably a random region in the status bar as anaconda uses it's own region (labeled \"anaconda_doc\") or maybe because you have the \"display_signatures\" turned on and then this is an \"Anaconda: [empty_signature]\" message followed by \"This module is always available \" that is shown by another plugin.\n. Working perfectly fine for me in ST3 build 3066 on OS X, in fact, I never experienced anything like that ever neither on GNU/Linux or OS X.\nWhich operating system are you using, which other plugins are you using? Are you sure anaconda JsonServer is running?\nWhat happens if you use \"Anaconda: Display object docs\" in the command palette when the cursor is over any module that you imported in your code?\n. Hi\nNope, pep8 is included into the plugin, I am not familiar with any of those plugins or the theme so I am not sure if they override gutter sections themselves.\nI use Yosemite myself and as I said I don't have any of those problems. Let's try somethings.\n1) Check the Sublime Text 3 Console to see if there is any errors from anaconda\n2) Take a look at ~/Library/Caches/Jedi//anaconda_jsonserver.log to see if there is pep8 linting (or linting at all) going on\n3) If none of the previous steps reveals a clear problem, run the command palette comand Anaconda: Show error list you will get a list of all the errors in the current buffer\n4) If you still get nothing, disable all plugins except anaconda and restart Sublime Text 3\n5) If anaconda works as expected, enable one plugin at time and test if anaconda works\n6) If after activate plugin X anaconda stop working, please, report the bug in both anaconda and whatever is the other plugin issues tracker\n. No worries.\n. Hi @white-hat \nI can't reproduce the described behaviour in OS X 10.10:\n\nNeed more information.\nWhich python_interpreter do you have configured?\nIs there any logs at the Sublime Text console?\n. Anaconda is supposed to show you an error message in case that the \"python_interpreter\" is wrong, was the typo in the \"python_interpreter\"? \n. I just read your other issue report, forget that question\n. Autocompletion is disabled for SublimeREPL (in fact it can not be enabled in any way). Being in your SublimeREPL buffer, open the ST3 console and write the following:\npython\nprint(view.settings().get('repl'))\nWhat do you get?. Hi\nCan you try to run PyLint using the same interpreter directly in the file to see what happens?. \nYou can find debug information in the Sublime Text console and in ~/.cache/jedi/<name_of_yoour_project>/anaconda_jsonserver.log\nBtw, which version of the python interpreter are  you using?\n. One more question.\nAre you using the configuration option \"pylint_rcfile\"?\n. I'll take a look at this issue this evening, after confirmation, it will be tagged for next release (v1.3.5) but I will prepare a branch with the fix in case that you want to have it before the release (that maybe take a while)\n. One more question guys, wich version of PyLint are you using?\n. Hi guys.\nThis problem is fixed in branch pylint_fix#230\nSeems like the PyLint linter never worked at all before this fix, not sure about how many people is using it instead of PyFlakes.\nThe fix is going to be released in the next version (that is gona take a while yet) so if you want to use this fix before that happens you can follow this procedure.\n1. (if you installed it using Package Control) Remove Anaconda using Package Control: Remove Package\n2. cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages (or whatever your Packages directory is located in your OS)\n3. (if you installed it using Package Control) git clone https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda.git \n4. (if you installed it using git) git pull\n5. git checkout pylint_fix#230\n6. Restart your Sublime Text 3\nIt will work.\n. No problem.\n. Fixed on fix_hook_files#231 branch.\nNow, if the hook file can't be parsed as valid JSON, anaconda fails gracefully and show an error message to the user about the problem in the file. Configured python_interpreter or default one is used instead.\n\nThis will be released in v1.3.5\n. Hi\nI couldn't reproduce this problem, I've installed Python from hombrew and configured anaconda to use it as python_interpreter everything works as expected.\nI will give another try from a clean state installation but for now I add the non-replicable tag\n. I am not able to reproduce this problem. Goto is provided by Jedi, Jedi is able to see anything that your Python interpreter can see.\nDo the following from a terminal:\n$ cd Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_lib\n/usr/local/bin/python\nimport jedi\nsrc = '''import os\nos.'''\ns = jedi.Script(src, 2, 3)\nprint(s.completions())\nYou will get a list with all the possible symbols, if this is working, goto uses the same functionality so it should be working as well.\n. Set auto_python_builder_enabled as false and remove the anaconda builder from your project configuration file\n. For some reason, ST3 doesn't like shortcuts that uses \"alt+r\" it always show you it's own Alt+R command, if you don't use \"alt+r\" in your combination it just works fine.\nIt seems to be a bug in Sublime Text 3 itself.\n. I understand that you mean to move the buffer where the selected entry (just selected without press enter) is.\nThe main difference between ST and anaconda in that context is that ST is not able to give you results outside the buffer that you are on in that moment while anaconda give you a list of all the possible locations of that symbol in your PYTHONPATH and project.\nI am not sure how hard is to implement something like that, I can take a look and come back with an answer to this request when I have more information.\nThat is possibly going to take a while by the way.\n. This was already introduced with the new and improved ExplorerPanels. Hi.\nYou shouldn't get any completion from words in your buffer as you have suppress_word_completions and suppress_explicit_completions set as true, not sure why you are stil getting any, try to restart your sublime text and let me know if you still get them.\nAbout pandas, I know Jedi (the library that anaconda uses for autocompletion) had some problems with it in the past (as well as with other libraries that use some level of \"magic\" or tricks) so it's possible that you don't get all the autocompletions for some sort of objects in some libraries.\nIn the other hand, those kind of problems are already known in Jedi project and Anaconda is moving to more up to date versions of the stable Jedi library in the next release.\n. Hi again.\nDepending on your operating system you can find logs in:\n- Linux: ~/.cache/jedi//anaconda_server.log\n- OS X: ~/Library/Caches/Jedi//anaconda_server.log\n- Windows: %APPDATA%\\Jedi\\Jedi/anaconda_server.log\nIf you are using Linux or OS X, you can see how the plugin interacts with the JsonServer tailing the log file (tail -f in the file) so you can check if the autocompletion is being fired.\nYou don't need linting to fire autocompletion.\nAbout Jedi, anaconda doesn't have a branch with a most up to date version of jedi but install a new version in your own copy of anaconda is pretty straightforward, you just need to donwload it from the Jedi repo in GitHub and replace the anaconda/anaconda_lib/jedi directory with the jedi directory in the version that you just downloaded, as far as I know, Jedi didn't broke their API compatibility so it should work fine.\n. Hi.\nThe error that you get with the new version of jedi es because seems like they removed the clear_caches function and anaconda uses it to try to reduce the impact in memory consumption that Jedi has when parses big modules (like pandas).\nLet me know what David tells you in Jedi's project.\n. Hi.\nCan you take a look at the logs?\n. Ok\nI just test it myself in my AnacondaST3 installation and everything is working fine with the last version that is available on package control (1.3.4) there is a but anyway\nI am using:\n- OS X 10.10 (yosemite)\n-  ST3 build 3066 \n- Anaconda v1.3.4\nMy hardware specifications are:\niMac (27-inch, Late 2013)\n3.5 GHz Intel Core i7\n24 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n3Tb Fusion Drive\nThis is the result of try to autocomplete pandas in my system:\n\nBut the index took a while to get built, the JsonServer loaded these specific modules:\n\nAfter the index was built and anaconda cached it, is working properly everytime.\n. I think your anaconda configuration is still wrong, ST shouldn't hangs at all.\nCan you make a gist with your Anaconda.sublime-settings and your project configuration?\nBTW: What do you mean with \"I specified the python interpreter for ST3 \"?\n. Hi\nYup, SublimePythonIDE and anaconda are not compatible at all :) The new issue that you are experimenting is not an issue, is normal anaconda behavior. Let me explain.\nAnaconda is 100% asynchronous, that means that when ST3 send a signal saying \"hey anaconda, I want you fire any autocompletion that you have to give me\", anaconda just fires the autocompletion request into the anaconda's JsonServer and return back an empty response to ST3, that is because anaconda will never block waiting to perform any operation.\nThen, when the anaconda's JsonServer has a result available, it return it back to ST3 and anaconda inject the results in the ST3 autocompletion firing it again.\nAs you already know, the first time that you are going to autocomplete something, Jedi build an index and then its contents are cached, with normal size Python packages that operation is almost instant so the user doesn't notice anything, but with Pandas, Numpy, PyQt, PySide, PyGTK there is a small delay between the anaconda plugin sends the request to the JsonServer and the request comes back with the new content.\nThe other option is totally block the ST3 interface while the index is being built that is in fact, not an option :)\nEnjoy Anaconda and feel free to close this issue if you are satisfied already with the support.\nRegards.\n. Hi again.\n1. Is not configurable now but can be added\n2. Hmmm, is instant for me, I tried in both my iMac and a DELL XPS 13 with Ubuntu GNU/Linux, btw, iPython is amazing\n3. There is no way right now but can be added as well\nIf you want to see 1 and 3 implemented, please, fill a couple of feature request issues.\nThanks.\n. What do you have under the cursor when you use the feature?\n. Well, as you can see here, this project seems to be really complex, make sure that you can run the tests following their instructions there and if you are able to pass the tests then you should configure the anaconda's test runner in order to run the tests in that project cos they aren't going to work out of the box.\nTake a look at the anaconda's test runner documentation for more information \nInstalling nupic in a virtual environment and following the procedure below I managed to run the whole test suite (I am not familiar with pytest so I am not sure how the configuration to make test under the cursor be fired will be, but I am pretty sure that it can be configured)\nI cloned numpic in my /tmp directory.\nmkvirtualenv borrame\ncd /tmp/numpic\npip install -r external/common/requirements.txt\npython setup.py build\npython setup.py develop\nThen I saved a project file for numpic and configured it as:\njson\n\"settings\":\n    {\n        \"python_interpreter\": \"/home/damnwidget/.virtualenvs/borrame/bin/python\",\n        \"test_command\": \"python /tmp/nupic/scripts/run_tests.py -u\",\n        \"test_before_command\": \"export NUPIC=/tmp/nupic\",\n        \"test_virtualenv\": \"~/.virtualenvs/borrame\"\n    }\nThen when I run, Run full project test suite It just get tested:\n```\n========================================================= test session starts ==========================================================\nplatform linux2 -- Python 2.7.6 -- pytest-2.4.2 -- /home/damnwidget/.virtualenvs/borrame/bin/python\nplugins: xdist, cov\ncollected 815 items / 2 skipped \ntests/external/py2/asteval_test.py:32: TestCase.testImportAndVersions PASSED\ntests/external/py2/testfixture_test.py:48: TestPytest.testSetUpModuleCalled PASSED\ntests/unit/py2/nupic/utils_test.py:37: UtilsTest.testMovingAverage PASSED\ntests/unit/py2/nupic/utils_test.py:76: UtilsTest.testMovingAverageInstance PASSED\ntests/unit/py2/nupic/algorithms/anomaly_likelihood_jeff_test.py:166: ArtificialAnomalyTest.testCaseContinuousBunchesOfSpikes PASSED\ntests/unit/py2/nupic/algorithms/anomaly_likelihood_jeff_test.py:250: ArtificialAnomalyTest.testCaseIncreasedAnomalyScore PASSED\ntests/unit/py2/nupic/algorithms/anomaly_likelihood_jeff_test.py:193: ArtificialAnomalyTest.testCaseIncreasedSpikeFrequency PASSED\ntests/unit/py2/nupic/algorithms/anomaly_likelihood_jeff_test.py <- ../../home/damnwidget/.virtualenvs/borrame/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/unittest2/case.py:58: ArtificialAnomalyTest.testCaseMissingBunchesOfSpikes SKIPPED\n...\ntests/unit/py2/regions/regions_spec_test.py:75: KNNAnomalyClassifierRegionTest.testValidOutputSpec PASSED\ntests/unit/py2/regions/regions_spec_test.py:110: KNNAnomalyClassifierRegionTest.testValidParameterSpec PASSED\ntests/unit/py2/regions/regions_spec_test.py:163: KNNAnomalyClassifierRegionTest.testValidSpec PASSED\n=============================================== 800 passed, 17 skipped in 115.47 seconds ===============================================\n```\nnote: the output has been shortened for displaying purposes\n.

Hi @chetan51 \nI am going to sleep now (almost 03:00 AM here in Dublin) but you can take a look at here and here\n. Yes.\n. I'll take a look on that this weekend but fixes wouldn't be available until 1.3.5\n. This error has been fixed in branch fix238, waiting for release v1.3.6\n. We use ST3 builtin features to run those tests so it's supposed to update the panel as soon as the external process generates some output.\n. Hi,\ntry to set this two options in your anaconda configuration file as true\njson\n\"suppress_word_completions\": true,\n\"suppress_explicit_completions\": true\n. You are getting the first CharField because ST3 is giving you back what is in your buffer, the second one came from anaconda, this is why it says that is a class. If you don't want to get words that are in your buffer, you have to set supress_words_completions as true.\nWhile you don't totally suppress what ST3 completes by himself, you are gonna continue getting those repeated words.\n. Hi.\nAnaconda is not installed \"in a weird folder\", it get installed into the marked as non sublime packages installation directory.\nBeing a non sublime package means that anaconda is not compressed and distributed as Anaconda.sublime-package (that is actually a Zip) because parts of anaconda need to be run as a standalone service so a real directory in the file system will exists.\nSaid that, the procedure to install anaconda in Windows is the same than in whatever other operating system, just install it with Package Control or clone it manually using git into your Packages folder.\nAnyway, if that is your directory hierarchy, it doesn't seems to be correct, it should be like (note that only directories has been added to the following diagram to maintain it simple):\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Packages\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Anaconda\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 anaconda_lib\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 autoimport\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 autopep\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 autopep8_lib\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib2to3\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 fixes\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 pgen2\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 builder\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 jedi\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 api\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 evaluate\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 compiled\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 fake\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 parser\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 linting\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 gutter_mark_themes\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 pyflakes\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 anaconda_server\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 commands\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 handlers\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 compat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 commands\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 listeners\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 messages\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates\nI would just uninstall it and install it again, if you continue experiencing problems just clone this repository into your Packages installation (but you should take care of update manually the package doing git pull every time that there is a new anaconda release). \nIf the problem persist, maybe should be a good idea to open an issue in the Package Control project itself as anaconda has nothing to do with the way that Package Control downloads and installs it.\n. I am navigating through my smartphone now, so I can't really help you that much right now but maybe is useful if you take a look to the anaconda developers documentation related with the JsonServer.\nYou can find it here it may guide you a bit and help you to understand how anaconda works.\nBTW I don't think is a good idea to have enabled SublimeCodeIntel and Anaconda at the same time, its pretty possible that CodeIntel interfere with anaconda.\n. Is there something in the Sublime Text console log?\nOn 21 Nov 2014 23:37, \"Allen Nie\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI simply opened a new issue because it's unrelated to the previous\none...and that one is (should be) closed.\nI'm running Windows 8.1 with ST3.

Hi @alimony \n\nThis documentation is generated using the sources in https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda.github.io if I merge this pull request, the changes are gonna be lost next time that we generate the documentation.\nCan you make the changes directly in https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda.github.io ?\nThank you!\n. I don't think that is caused by anaconda, I mean, anaconda just call Sublime Text to show the auto completion box, anaconda doesn't decide how or where that box is draw in the ST window.\nI experienced that some times in old ST3 releases I fixed it just restarting ST3\n. @skaughtx0r that line is there for a reason, anconda's completion is an asynchronous operation, when the autocompletion is called, anaconda fires it to the JsonServer and return control to ST3 that shows it's regular + other plugins completions. When a response with a completion list comes from the async socket a callback is fired (that calls _complete) and then anaconda hides the already shown autocompletion box before to populate it with the new data, then fires the ST3 native auto completion to show the box again.\nIf ST3 is doing somethign weird on auto completion is probably because you have another plugin messing around with it (probably SublimeCodeIntel?).\n. Probably you had SublimeJedi active at the same time\n. No problem\n. Hi @Endogen \nAnaconda disables some plugins that are known to interfere badly with it when they are present in the system, so, if anaconda is enabled it disables SublimeCodeIntel (between others), then if anaconda is unloaded or disabled, it enables again all those plugins.\nThis measure can look harsh but has been taken after many years of solving problems caused by 3rd party plugins that doesn't take into account how they can interfere or make other plugins totally misbehave. The only real solution to the problem would be if Sublime Text had a sandboxed environment where to run each plugin but sadly that doesn't happens (and it not gonna happen).\nYou have a couple of options here\n1) Recommended: Just open the Command Palette and disable anaconda when you need to work with SublimeCodeIntel\n2) Less Recommended: Disable the auto plugins disabling in anaconda https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/Anaconda.sublime-settings#L667-L671\nI don't recommend you to disable the auto plugins disabling on anaconda as you will start to experiment really weird behavior due SublimeCodeIntel modifying how ST3 behave when a Python file is being edited (like showing autocompletion when you write a colon, what is totally stupid).\nI hope this solved your doubts.. Wow, I will take a look, thanks.\n. This was solved in the last release, I forgot to close it\n. Hmmmm not really \n1.3.5 points to https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/commit/01e707b216c07156c44916c0d6e4b72d5f289666\n. I see...

Hi\n\nAre you sure that you don't have the configuration for debugging activated?\n. Check how these configuration options are set in your project/general anaconda configuration.\n. You are welcome :)\n. Hi.\nAnaconda is not able to switch from a regular interpreter to a vagrant one, this is already warned in the documentation as a note into the section Configure Sublime Text 3 project. \nST3 need to be restarted in order to make it just work due some limitations in the ST3 plugin architecture itself.\n. There are several problems with the vagrant support on anaconda, first is that it has no maintainer.\nThere are already fallback mechanisms in place as you can see here\nIn Vagrant we have this method that checks if the vagrant is up but it does only on initialization then it's not checked ever again. Probably calling that method will be enough to add some fallback mechanism that uses a regular interpreter always warning the user about the situation.\nSadly I can dedicate a few to no time per week to the project myself, but PRs are welcome guys. If you think you can hook into the plugin and add the needed mechanics, please take a look at the Anaconda's developers book and get your hands dirty :)\n. Hi\nFirst of all, thank you for your contribution but there is two problems. The file that you updated is not part of anaconda but a third party library, we don't modify third party libraries as it would make the task of update them really complicated.\nI recommend you to take a look at the autopep8 project itself to see if you can contribute there directly, this is their project page.\nThe other problem is that the autopep8 is not the reponsible of lint the code, the library that lints the code is pep8, as before, take a look at their project site to see if you can contribute there directly.\nRegards.\n. Hi @glymehrvrd \nFirst of all let me thank you for your contribution into anaconda. There is some small changes that have to be done to can merge this into master in the next release.\nA part from what is already commented inline, there is some thing that must be done as well.\n1) As you modified a function in the anaconda_server side, you have to make sure to modify the same function in the vagrant_server branch as well.\n2) This functionality must be configurable, I mean, there is people that doesn't use parameters autocompletion at all (like me) and maybe they don't want anaconda add any parenthesis to the methods (for example when passing them as parameters). That means that a new configuration option has to be added to the settings and has to be passed to the anaconda JsonServer packed into the rest of the request. Take a look at the commands section of the developers book and search for the prepare_send_data method to get detailed information about how that works.\nRegards.\n. Do you need some help with this pull @glymehrvrd?\n. Wasn't necessary that you closed the pull request.\n. Hi @Sharlock93 \nI guess you have some non ASCII characters in the path to your python interpreter and Windows is complaining about that.\nThe idna character encoding was added to Python in version 2.3 so I am not sure why the ST3 built-in Python interpreter is complaining here.\nCan you open your Sublime Text 3 console and write the line below there to see what happens?\npython\nimport encodings.idna\n. Btw, reading your first post again, seems like the problem is being raised by the interpreter that you have configured to be used as python_interpreter in your settings (if any, if you didn't set it, then is your PATH python.exe).\nTry to import condings.idna with that interpreter from the cmd.exe directly to see what happens.\n. Seems like there is something wrong in your Python installation.\n. I am happy that it has been solved himself :)\n. Hi.\nAnaconda works perfectly with Python3.4.x as it's the interpreter that I use to develop anaconda itself and I never had any problem.\nTake a look at ~/.cache/jedi/<name_of_your_project> log files that should give us more information about what can be wrong.\n. Fixed in branch fix252, pending of release in version 1.3.6\n. Hi @shadowleaves \nI was never able to reproduce the problem in #174 myself, seems like the user that had the problem reinstalled Sublime Text 3 completely and the problem disappeared.\nIf you open a ST3 console and write down: window.folders()\nWhich is the output that you get?\n. Seems like your ST3 is not able to resolve the directory where your code is. I am afraid that there not much that we can do in order to solve as it's an internal ST3 problem, try to uninstall and install ST3 from scratch.\nLet me know about the progress of this issue please.\n. Hi.\nThis change will break anaconda in the case that there is no views/buffers opened\n. Just one question.\nHow a module that has an import error can be successfully imported by other module?\nI mean, if we have three modules as in your example, A, B and C, and A has an import error, and B imports A, C will never import B successfully as B throws an ImportError exception so it fails to compile to bytecode so import B will never be a success operation as A has to be compiled by the interpreter before B is even being processed.\nI think the behavior is just the expected one.\n. Yeah, probably it would be considered a feature request, anyway I am not sure how valuable it is or even if it's possible to do it at all.\n. Fixed in release v2.1.10. Hi @kabamaru \nAnaconda doesn't use your internet connection at all, it connects to localhost so your OS should be using  the loopback interface to connect to the JsonServer (that runs locally in your computer).\nAre you sure you don't have any other stuff going on?\n. Looks like your computer is unable to resolve localhost. Is the line 127.0.0.1   localhost in your /etc/hosts file?\n. You're welcome\n. Hard to say really. \nMake sure it is not in the disabled packages, I would try to disable SublimeCodeIntel and SublimeLinter just to test if they are interfering in any way with Anaconda (I don't think so but who knows).\nTake a look at the Sublime Text 3 console to check if there are any errors related with that.\n. Glad to see that you solved the problem.\n. Hi\nThe pep8_ignore must be a list of strings with the full code of what you want to ignore, so in your case \npython\n\"pep8_ignore\":\n[\n    \"E402\"\n]\n. It's working for me.\nBefore the ignore:\n\nAfter the ignore:\n\nMake sure that you are not hiding your configuration in another lower configuration level.\nBtw, what is this \"_\" in the pyflakes_ignore?\n. Hi\nThat's interesting, if you move it to your project configuration it will work, for some reason ST is not getting the pep8_ignore settings from the Anaconda.sublime-settings in the User directory but it takes whatever other option that you configure there.\nI will take a look on this but I am not sure if this is a ST3 or an Anaconda problem.\n. Hi again @vindolin \nI investigated a bit more about this and after delete all the anaconda related configuration (except the python_interpreter) in my project.sublime-project file, ST3 was using the configured Anaconda.sublime-settings pep8_ignore settings from the User package.\nMake sure you don't have any empty pep8_ignore settings in your per project configuration.\n.

Hi.\n@matzhaugen if you mean to use Anaconda Distribution virtual environments with AnacondaST3 in Sublime Text 3 (this repo) I never tried to do it but it should be the same than use virtualenv.\nIf you know where your conda environment Python executable is, just add it as your python_interpreter in your AnacondaST3 plugin settings.\n. Hi.\nHonestly, I have no clue about how to use docker with anaconda as I had little use for docker myself. \nIn Vagrant we use a special vagrant branch that starts a minimal anaconda's JsonServer and exposes it due port Nat between the host and the guests but I am not sure about this approach with docker I should make some tests and become familiar with docker to be able to give a correct answer to this question.\n. Hi, take a look here: http://damnwidget.gitbooks.io/anacondast3-developers-documentation/content/architecture/jsonserver_related_design_and_architecture.html\n. And here: http://damnwidget.gitbooks.io/anacondast3-developers-documentation/content/architecture/README.html\n. @saulshanabrook do you get this error if you try to run it in a vagrant environment?\n. I will take a look at this to see if it could be included in v2.0.0 (next major release), as I see that this is a popular request with all the +1's in here. \nSaid that, I would probably don't ever use the feature myself so we would need a maintainer for it, we already have problems with the vagrant support as no one takes care of the vagrant branch.\nI don't like to have dead things in the package.\n. Hi guys.\nI did my first tests and I had excellent results, my understanding about docker since the first post in this thread was written has grown a lot, what a fantastic tool by the way, I am pleased to announce that I was able to create a small docker image based in Alpine Linux with  Python 2.7.10 on it running a minimal jsonserver with anaconda v1.4.25 on it exposing it's port and printing the JsonServer log to it's standard output so it's available via docker logs command.\nWhat was working? Everything that works in vagrant support that is:\nLinting 100%\nCompletion 100%\nMcCabe/Code Analyzer: 100%\nGoto: 100% on files that existed in the same path in both systems (not so useful, I will probably try to make something smart here to allow gotos and find usages)\nDocStrings and Tooltips: 100%\nImports Checker: 0% (I will probably deactivate it completely when running in remote)\nNext step from here is a refactor of the Worker class to make it's interface completely generic so we will end with something like DockerWorker and VagrantWorker both inheriting from RemoteWorker that inherits himself from Worker.\nThat means that in version v2.0.0 the anaconda JsonServer is gonna be able to run from:\nLocalhost\nVagrant VMs\nDocker Containers\nAny remote host that you can run it and connect to over the internet\nNote that probably the third option is gonna be kinda slow.\nA better/smarter failback mechanism must be put in place to avoid freeze the ST3 context if the remote server is not reachable for whatever reason or the configured python interpreter is not available.\nI will push a branch with the changes so you can test it and give feedback/contribute as soon as I can.\n. Hi guys, I am still designing the Docker support but I already added vanilla remote worker support and vagrant support. Even if the docker support is not there yet, you can make an idea of how is gonna be taking a look at the new wiki pages for anaconda v2\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Anaconda-V2:-Using-a-remote-python-interpreter\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Anaconda-v2:-Using-a-remote-python-interpreter-through-Vagrant\nJust take a look and share your thoughts, suggestions as the docker configuration support is gonna be like that.\nWhat do you think?\n. I will push the in-development docker branch tomorrow so you can start testing it and giving feedback as soon as possible, I am pretty sure that you will find bugs. I have still to make a huge refactor of the anaconda_lib directory including the new written workers so another beta test branch will be released after the refactor.\nYou can find the documentation here in the wiki page Using a Python interpreter running in a Docker Container\n. New branch is pushed: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/tree/docker \nTo install just clone the repo into your Sublime Text 3 Packages directory, (don't forget to uninstall the Package Control anaconda installation first) then do a checkout of the docker branch.\nTo report issues in the docker branch open a new issue with title [Docker Support]  and add a new comment in this issue pointing to the new issue that you created.\nThanks.\n. Hi guys.\nI pushed new commits with a complete refactor of every worker (Local, Remote and Vagrant) the way that the workers are used has not changed at all so the previous documentation is still valid. I need you guys test it again.\nThe refactor makes the code more maintainable and reduces the ST3 gui freezes when there are problems to connect the plugin to the JsonServer/Minserver.\nAny feedback is welcome (I didn't got any feedback so far that's not good).\nPlease, do a git pull in your docker branch.\nThanks.\n. Did you restarted your ST3 after switch branch?\nDid you follow the instructions on the error message?\n. There is some points that need clarification here:\n1) Make sure that your branch is up to date and this one is your last docker branch commit\n2) In your container, the $HOME environment variable is pointing to /opt/sfmoma/var make sure that the user that executes python to start the anaconda's minserver has the right permissions to write to that directory\n3) If you are exposing the port 19360 why you are using the IP 172.16.144.137 to connect to? Should not it be localhost?\n4) The error is because you just send random garbage from telnet and the minserver speaks Anaconda's JSON protocol\n. Ooops my fault, I didn't realized that you were working under OS X but you commented it in your previous post.\nI will take a look this evening when I can have access to my OS X box in home but it's weird, it should work with no problem at all, I even used a remote worker running in my work Linux box from my Windows home box over the Internet with no problems, the tcp:// Worker works like a charm normally.\n. Ok, answering your first question, you can use \"Anaconda: Show Documentation\" or you can just write whatever invalid random string that makes a syntax error and see if it gets linted, you can also just try to trigger the autocompletion in a standard lib module like os, if any of that is success, then you are on the road and ready to rock.\nAbout the paths. Anaconda always had the concept of extra_path, the extra_path is used to tell the underlying jedi library that we want to look for code in non standard places. The remote workers (tcp://, vagrant://) introduce a new paths concept, the pathmap, they are very different between them, the pathmap just translates your local paths into remote paths. Let's say that your code resides in /Users/mrmachine/projects/myproject but in the docker container it resides in /opt/myproject, when the ST3 client sends a command that uses paths, it sends the local path so for example /Users/mrmachine/projects/myproject/lib/somethingcool.py that path does not exists in the docker container, the pathmap translates this into /opt/myproject/lib/somethingcool.py\nYou still need to pass the /opt/myproject path to the Jedi, to do so you can add the query option &extra=path1&extra=path2&extra=pathN... as part of your tcp:// URI and add as many extra paths as you need.\n. @mrmachine, I just tested in my OS X and everything was working fine, I am using El Capitan and the new Docker Beta for OS X (that is not Docket Toolbox) it's much cleaner.\nI can't reproduce your error, anyway, something that I noticed recently in your report is the error message in your ST3 console is for LocalWorkers exclusively, if you are using a RemoteWorker trough the tcp:// URI you should get an error telling you to check your internet connection and other things related with the remote host.\nAre you sure there is no per-project or .rcfile messing around with your options?\n. Hey guys, how are we looking? Is anyone giving a try to the v2.0.0-rc1 or docker branches? It looks fine, any concerns? Release of v2.0.0 is closer now so all the feedback would be much appreciated.\n. Probably ST3 already fired a local anaconda Worker instead of a RemoteWorker and it was stick to it.\nIf you can reproduce it, open a ST3 console and write the following:\npython\nfrom anaconda.anaconda_lib.workers.market import Market\nprint(Market)\nIn that way we can see the kind of worker that your ST3 launched for you. In any case, I see that you are using the docker branch, try to use the v2.0.0-rc1 branch as it has some bug fixes already.\nI remember that I did fix some issues related with the interpreter/project switcher in v2.0.0-rc1\n. Looks like your ST3 is not using the Git version of anaconda at all, make sure that you uninstall any Anaconda version downloaded by Package Control, remove the git repository from the Packages directory and clone it again.\nI will add a Gist with the config files to the wiki\n. Here the gist with the example and instructions:\nhttps://gist.github.com/DamnWidget/3e58cec118879ed7baa08dc283e162a0\n. How are we looking guys? Are you still testing this? Shall we release and go \ud83c\udf34? :P\n. Docker support has been released with the anaconda v2.0.0 release today\n. Hi.\nRename it's supposed to rename the occurrences of the word to rename in the whole scope of your project. It uses jedi refactoring rename features but jedi is not so good with refactoring, the main logic of the rename feature can be found in this file https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/anaconda_server/commands/rename.py take a look if you wanna know a bit more about it.\n. I am not sure if SublimePythonIDE is still using rope, I think they switch to Jedi as well and it will probably conflict quite a bit with anaconda.\nP.S: I was used to contribute on that project and SUblimeRope (for ST2) long ago.\n. Done\n. Hi\nI can't reproduce this behavior. Are you using autocompletion on dot? http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/IDE/#toc_2\n. Weird... Can you give more details?:\nOperating System\nSublime Text 3 Build\nAnaconda Version\nI wasn't able to reproduce it nor in Windows 7, Ubuntu 14.04 or OS X 10.10.2\n. Still couldn't replicate this one.\nAnyone with the same issue?\n. As I said before, I can't replicate this behavior, when I press space ST3 just write an space, when I press tab ST3 just writes a tab (4 spaces in this case). Possible things that you can try out.\n1) Enable autocompletion on dot\n2) Disable (or remove) SublimeCodeIntel (I don't know if Djaneiro triggers the completion popup in any way as I never used myself, if you are in doubt, disable/remove it as well).\n3) Restart ST3 and try it again\nJust for the record, anaconda hooks into normal ST3 auto completion, anaconda doesn't fire by himself the autocompletion if ST3 doesn't fired it first.\n. You're welcome\n. https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda#autocomplete-drop-down-shows-up-incorrectly\n. What you mean that you verified it by checking sys.prefix? If you checked sys.prefix in Sublime Text 3 console you should get an empty string as the ST3 embedded interpreter is built into the C++ ST3 executable itself.\nAnaconda is not able to expand the variable $project_path because the extract_variables window method was added to Sublime Text 3 API in build 3068 last Feb the 5th and it's still in the in-development branch that means that not everyone can access to this build.\nAnaconda is not gonna be able to expand this variable until build 3068 becomes released to the general public. Until then, you should use absolute paths to your Python interpreter.\n. I don't understand why it's disgusting, note that english is not my first (nor my second) language.\n. I think the word that you are looking for is \"annoying\"\n. It's fixed by the way\n. Hi @hu6360567 \nAnaconda hooks into the built-in ST3 autocompletion so I recommend you to enable the ST autocompletion (\"auto_complete\": true).\nAnaconda works much better with automatic auto completion enabled and fire autocompletion on dot instead of tab, take a look here to learn how to make ST3 fire autocompletions on dor for Python files \n. Make sure that you don't have SublimeCodeIntel enabled at the same time that you are using anaconda (at least for python code).\n. Gonna close this one for now, feel free to open it if you get new information but for now I am just labeling it as \"unconfirmed\"\n. Hi\nThis file is generated by the code here so any change to this file in this branch will be automatically deleted in new documentation generations. Please, make the pull request in the anaconda.github.io repo.\nThanks.\n. It's ok, no problem :)\n. I don't think add another layer in the top of the PyFlakes, PEP8 and McCabe libraries is helpful in any way. Anaconda already provides a wrapper around all those libraries using an architecture based in components that allows us to replace one of them by other thing in any moment with minimal or no impact at all in the rest of the plugin.\nFlake8 is just a convenience that I don't see that convenient for us. Anaconda already supports per-project configuration (trough .sublime-project files), by the way, PEP8 and PEP257 libraries also supports configuration using setup.cfg, tox.ini and .pep8 or .pep257 (respectively) if the file is present in the path.\nA part from that, the required changes to support flake8 into the current Anaconda stack are huge so no real advantage/convenience here.\nAdding the noqa marker for other linters is just trivial, we already added some in the past (like for example in here)\nI don't think we are gonna support flake8 into the plugin as it's doesn't really offer anything great that make it really worth\n. Hi.\nAs I already said, you can use tox.ini files to configure the pep8 and pep257 behaviors. I am not sure now about PyFlakes and McCabe but I think that they support some sort of configuration via configuration files in some way.\nAbout the other issues that you made reference, it is only one issue and it was marked as wontfix because the new auto-import feature was gonna make the noqa in unused imports just obsolete. Unfortunately the new auto-import support is delayed mainly because the library that we were gonna use is non stable and need proper fixes to can be even considered to be included into anaconda itself.\nFeel free to open the #142 issue so we can discuss there adding noqa marker support for other parts of the linting reviewing specific scenarios or use cases.\n. What you mean with \"same section as flake8\"?\nI will accept PR always that flake8 is an alternative implementation to the current stack and can be enabled or disabled in the configuration (and of course it supports that exact same features, options and flexibility than the current solution).\n. Hi @RonnyPfannschmidt \nI think is possible that you can implement something like that flake8 init files in really easy way for anaconda itself as anaconda already support global PATH configuration files (but only allow to override python_interpreter and extra_paths by design).\nTake a look at Environment hook files\n section in the AnacondaST3 documentation web site\n. Add a system to re-organize how anaconda treat the severity of different errors from different linters should be a non trivial task but not a hard one.\nAs always PRs are welcome.\n. Then I suggest to @assumptionsoup to move his/her request to a new issue as I am closing this one now.\n. Hi\nTooltips are pretty cool but there are two problems with them right now\n1. They are pretty bugged at the moment including non theme colors inheritance into de tooltip panel.\n2. They are only available in the 3070 build that not everyone can access to\nThis feature is not gonna be part of anaconda until build 3070 (at least) is available to the general ST3 public.\nObviously we can start playing with it in some development branch, even use ST3 versioning check to make the feature available to anyone using the 3070 build branch or better, but that feels just wrong.\nNo one tell us that the 3070 branch is not gonna be unreleased for 12 months like already happened in the past.\nBut yeah definitely something to start playing with.\n. https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/releases/tag/v1.4.0\n. This is how it looks in darker themes:\n\n. I told you, ST3 tooltips implementation is still bugged as hell :P \nEnjoy!\n. Hey @cryzed \nI was wondering which platform do you work on because I was testing this thing in Linux today and I noticed that some of the docstrings were worng/weird.\nDid you noticed something?\n. Anaconda doesn't trigger autocompletions @karolyi, it just hooks into default ST3 completions so yes, SublimeCodeIntel was getting in the way (as usual).\n. Send the PR please I will review it later today\n. Sure, make the PR\n. Hi @eujing \nThank you so much but I already have it solved (is not released yet because there are more things to fix and I want to improve the thing a bit). It was easier to fix it in anaconda_lib/tooltips.py by the way.\nOf course I encourage you to contribute with anaconda in the future with more fixes and improvements.\nRegards and thank you again.\n. Can I see your project config file?\n. Please, follow the steps below and paste your output\n1. Show Sublime Text 3 Console\n2. Paste sublime.active_window().project_data()\n. Open a Python file, write print() on it and execute the command again, has the output changed?\n. Do you get lints or autocompletion in your ST3 from anaconda package?\nWhat is the value of your auto_python_builder_enabled setting?\n. I don't think anaconda is working at all for you. Do the following to check that anaconda is running.\n1. Open a project that have Python code and write something on any Python file (that is not a comment or a docstring)\n2. Open a Windows PowerShell or CMD.exe\n3. Write WMIC path win32_process where \"name like '%python%' get commandline\n4. Paste here the results\n5. Open Sublime Text 3 Console\n6. Paste here it's contents\n7. Open%APP_DATA\\Jedi\\Jedi\\anaconda_whatever\\anaconda_jsonserver` with ST3 (or other text editor) and paste here it's content\n. No, I told you another PATH (the Jedi path young padawan).\nCongratulations!!! You just found a bug introduced in v1.4.0!!!\n. Hi @gavreh \nThis should be fixed on version 1.4.3, can you please confirm that anaconda works as expected for you when you have time to test it?\nIf there is still some problem, feel free to reopen the issue again.\n. Seems like Package Control takes a while to detect new releases when a plugin is updated. You have two options:\n- Spam the Upgrade Packages option of Package Control using the Command Palette\n- Download the last release as ZIP file from here and replace your Packages\\Anaconda contents with the contents inside anaconda-v1.4.3 after uncompress it\nAs a suggestion, just wait for Package Control\n. I guess that everything works fine as you didn't report anything new.\n. No problem\n. It doesn't seems to be related... can you please check why your Anaconda.sublime-settings can not be open? (in your logs Unable to open /home/ds/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/Anaconda.sublime-settings)\n. There is a fix for that specific error waiting to be released, I didn't had time yet to prepare the release but it will be released soon, for now, disable the tooltips in your configuration.\n. Set display_signatures as false\n. I am using my phone right now so I can't really look into it but can  you try to change line 186 on file anaconda_lib/helpers.py to view.window() and check again?\n. I just made a small fix release @hyperknot \n. Open a PowerShell or CMD.exe and go to your anaconda installation under the Packages folder in your Sublime Text 3 %APPDATA%. CD into the anaconda_lib folder and start an interactive Python interpreter on that path.\nCopy and paste the following:\n``` python\nimport jedi\nprint(jedi.Script('import arcpy; arcpy.').completions())\n```\nPaste it's results here\n. This sounds like a complete new sub-system, as far as I know Jedi doesn't support that.\n. Hi @finalinches \nDon't worry about them, they wouldn't last long (of course they don't stay forever neither) and they are doing nothing (if ST3 is closed).\n. You didn't need to create another issue you could re-open #286, anyway, anaconda checks that the Sublime Text 3 process is running every five seconds, if the process is not running, then it kills itself. I need more information as this never happened before to anyone.\nPlease, execute the steps below and paste here your results\n- Open your ST3 in a project that contains Python code so anaconda gets spawned\n- Open a console in your Sublime Text 3 (View -> Show Console) and write this on it: import os; os.getpid()\n- Copy the PID that you just got back from the action above, paste here and remember it as you are gonna use it in the next step\n- Open a PowerShell or a cmd.exe and write: tasklist /FI PID eq <write_here_the_PID_that_you_got>, paste it's output here.\n- In the same PowerShell or cmd.exe write: MIC path win32_process where \"name like '%python%' get commandline, paste it's output here\n. That's because I had a typo, the command is WMIC\n. Ok, now close your Sublime Text 3, wait one minute, run the tasklist command again to make sure that pugin_hosts is not zombie in your system and run the wmic command again.\nGo to %APPDATA%\\Jedi\\Jedi\\neutron and paste here the contents of the file anaconda_jsonserver.log\n. Which was the output of tasklist and wmic commands?\n. That's hard to believe, as you can see here, the JsonServer python process uses the same tasklist command to determine if the plugins_host process is still running, then, if the PID is not in the output it just sets the self.die variable as True that makes the thread to exit the loop effectively calling self.server.shutdown that closes the handler.\nI don't have access no any Windows 8 machine but this is working fine in a Windows 7 VM that I use to test AnacondaST3 in windows platform. I will expect to get errors in the anaconda_jsonserver.log comming from the asyncore loop in case that the shutdown can't be done for some reason. \n. Really weird, I will take a look into this issue as soon as I can install an OEM/Test Windows 8.1 VM\n. Cool, I will add an official fix for this in the next release :)\n. Take a look at the README section 'Autocompletions for import behave badly' there is a workaround to fix that as its a ST3 problem\n. Hi, you have to create a file called Python.sublime-settings in your Packages/User directory (use the Browse Packages option in the ST3 preferences menu to open it) with the following content:\njson\n{\n    \"auto_complete_triggers\": [{\"selector\": \"source.python - string - comment\n    - constant.numeric\", \"characters\": \".\"}]\n}\nYou shouldn't get any type of Anaconda autocompletion when you press colon or comma keys.\n. This is what I get when I type in colon.\n\nNothing. I said that before here and is in the documentation as well, anaconda doesn't implements any mechanism to fire the autocompletion event, instead, anaconda hook it himself into the regular ST3 autocompletion even that is why you have to configure the regular ST3 autocompletion trigger (you do that in Python.sublime-settings into your Package/User directory as anaconda doesn't trigger any action for autocomplete itself).\nThe plugin never fires any action for autocomplete that could interfere with any other ST3 packages that you can have installed.\nAs I already said, anaconda doesn't fire the autocomplete event at all so it's just not possible that anaconda fires the autocompletion event into ST3 when a colon or a comma or whatever other character is typed in the editor.\nAs the character that is firing this is just a colon, and as a guess, take a look at any package that completes PHP or C++, especially try to disable SublimeCodeIntel as they are not as considered with other packages that could be running in ST3 as anaconda is.\n. You are welcome\n. This will be included in next release. Thank you.\n. @Gruszks, your problem was unrelated to this, it's solved in version 1.4.6\n. Hi @hu6360567 \nJust set enable_signatures_tooltip as false\n. It's well documented in the package documentation\n. Sorry but you should be posting this issue in the Sublime Text 3 issues project itself, anaconda just uses the ST3 API to show those tooltips but it has nothing to do with how they are displayed or have any control on them beyond just use the ST3 API\n. Hi @edgar-ch \nIs this error deterministic? Because I think is pure coincidence about the 'pep8_ignore'. Can you replicate it?\n. I don't know. Can I have access to that file contents?\n. Hi @edgar-ch \nI did test that file and it works for me. Can you give me more details about your specific environment? OS, Python version, Virtualenv Version (if any), ST3 version, Anaconda version.\n. I am gonna close this one, as I could not replicate it ever.\n. Which operating system are you working on?\n. Anaconda tries to resolve \"localhost\". Closing this now. Thanks.\n. Every time that I've seen those kind of error reports from users it's\nbecause some misconfiguration of the /etc/hosts in OS X that makes anaconda\nnot able to connect/resolve to localhost.\nMake sure that your /etc/hosts is not corrupted or missconfigured.\nOn 11 Apr 2015 12:39 am, \"Matt Hayes\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSame problem as @colorfulfool https://github.com/colorfulfool.

Hi @kevinsallee \n\nI am not familiar myself with the Jedi internals but I guess (and remember, is just a guess) that Jedi is not able to process b.py when you run it in a.py as a.py doesn't imports b.py so Jedi has no clue about the existence of b.py itself.\nIn my experience with Jedi I've seen similar cases where Jedi just uses the import tree to analyze the working files. For more information about Jedi internals, is better if you head to the Jedi project itself as they will give you exact answers and no guesses.\nI am sorry to can't be more helpful here.\n. I don't think we can capture the hover event for the gutter icons section of the interface\n. The order is for severity as far as I can remember now. When you put the cursor over a linted line, you get a message about the error in the Sublime Text 3 status bar.\n. Fixed in next release\n. Hi.\nI can't replicate the described behavior neither on Linux or OS X, make sure is not other plugin (like SublimeCode Intel) the one that is causing that problem.\n. Sublime CodeIntel is always the culprit :)\n. Can you take a look at ~/.cache/jedi/<your_project_name>/anaconda_jsonserver.log ?\n. I can't see anything weird in the jsonsever logs.\nIs this happening in consistent way? Can you reproduce it at will?\n. Marked for next release\n. Marked for next release\n. Hi @jaggerwang \nThis is probably because the size of the file that you are working on is big enough to take more than one second in get formatted.\nTry raising the value of auto_formatting_timeout from 1 second to whatever works and is acceptable for you.\n. Hi.\nDepending on your Operating System you can find log files in different places\n-  Linux: $HOME/.cache/jedi/your_project_name/anaconda_jsonserver.log\n- OS X: $HOME/Library/Caches/Jedi/your_project_name/anaconda_jsonserver.log\n- Windows: %APPDATA%\\Jedi\\Jedi\\your_project_name/anconda_jsonserver.log\n. Hi.\nIf you only one change has been update OS X, it's obvious that something in the update has affected the plugin. With no more information I will just guess that your /etc/hosts file is corrupted and your OS X is not able to resolve the 'localhost' domain.\nGive it a try.\n. I have no problems to run anaconda with the latest version of Yosemite, if\nanaconda was working fine before you updated OS X, probably the problem is\nin the update itself (/etc/hosts file being corrupted and anaconda not\nbeing able to connect to \"localhost\"?). Also make sure that your configured\npython interpreter is right and available.

Well, the only way that I've been able to reproduce this is just writing the wrong path to the Python interpreter in the settings. I can't reproduce that problem using correct paths so please, review you wrote the right path and the user executing ST3 has permissions to execute the python interpreter in the configured path.\n. Hi. You can try to change the code of the anaconda's process spawner to give you detailed information about what the problem exactly is.\n\nIf you open this file in the anaconda_lib directory you can change the code below to something like:\npython\nexcept Exception as err:\n        logging.error(\n            'Your operating system denied the spawn of {}'\n            ' process.

I just found this O.o https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/832434\nNot sure what is causing that but the only available answers are:\n1) The ST3 python interpreter is building a wrong Windows path like C:\\Python32/python.exe (instead of C:\\Python32\\Python.exe) that I doubt as the path is just fine in the message\n2) Some windows crazyness\nNot sure how can I help you here.\n.

Then, I think that the question here is:\nWhy the plugin_host application can't connect to localhost in your system? It seems to be an environmental problem.\n. Looking at the whole log file, seems like anaconda connected successfully in the second try INFO:root:Registering handler with address ('localhost', 43296) that means anaconda started a JsonServer with success in your machine.\nIs not working properly now?\n. What do you have in your python_interpreter configuration setting? The problem is that your OS X is complaining about a file name being too long when it tries to execute the Json Server as you can see in the log OSError: [Errno 63] File name too long\n. What happens if you try to execute in your terminal the following?:\npython -B '/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib/../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py'\n. Well, I am not expert in OS X but yeah seems like something is wrong. HFS+ file system (the default in OS X) limit for file names is 255 unicode character long, there is no limit for paths so you shouldn't get that error.\nTake a look at what you have in your temp folders, maybe there is a very long named file in there, I will probably try to restart the system (did you try to turn it off and on again?) to see if the problem is recurrent.\n. Anaconda just uses whatever you have configured as python_interpreter, something is messing with how subprocess.py is working in your system/ST3 installation there is not much that I can do as I am not able to reproduce this error myself.\nIf I was you, I will create a simple Python script that made use of subprocess.Popen just to make an ls -la or something like that and try to execute it with your OS X system python installation, then you will probably discover if it's your OS X what is screwing things or it's the Python interpreter embedded into ST3 itself.\nIf it's ST3 itself I will suggest to complete uninstall and manually clear all the files in Application Support and reinstall it from scratch.\n. If you wanna make your ST3 to read your environment variables you have to start it from a terminal using the subl command.\nClosing this again :)\n. The minimum python version supported by anaconda is Python 2.6 @Yokan-Jan I don't believe it works at all with Python 2.5. Hi @cryzed \nProbably a bug in the Jedi version that we are using now. I just tested in a Python3 interpreter and I didn't got any completion neither (you can easily test it with this piece of code into a Python interpreter inside the anaconda_lib directory print(Script('import Tkinter as Tk; Tk.').completions())).\nI think you should file a bug report about this in the Jedi library Github project site, try to find an already open issue because is quite possible that this is a known issue already as Tkinter is very popular.\n. Closing this issue as it was already addressed by @davidhalter in Jedi\n. Make sure that your configured Python interpreter is a Python 3 interpreter, take a look to the documentation for more information.\n. Hi. I can't reproduce the described behaviour neither in Linux or OS X.\nCan you provide more information?, ST3 version, Anaconda version, Operating System, other installed plugins.\nThank you.\n. About the Spawn problem, take a look at #314, seems like ST3 added some kind of bug in their last releases that maintain rubbish/garbage configuration and this is affecting how anaconda decides from which directories append your project code.\n. Hi guys. Sorry for the late response, I've been in holidays.\nThis is the last change into the jsonserver.py file in the last months and as you can see, it will only affect on Windows platform so I don't think we introduced anything in that change.\nThe only thing that come to my mind is the Jedi library update that we did in here.\nAnyway, I didn't suffer any of those problems myself so I need more information in order to reproduce it/fix it. Jedi is already being known for being a bit of a memory abuser when it's parsing really big python packages like PyQt, NumPy and other like those ones. This is why we call the internal Jedi cache cleaner after any call to the Jedi library so that will remove from the cache any non accessed piece of data but Jedi is totally out of our control here.\nI need to know with which Python packages are you working on and how big are your projects because as I already said I didn't experienced any issue myself in Linux or OS X.\n. Hi.\nI usually have my ST3 + Anaconda running for weeks in my workplace Linux box and never had that problem so I think we can discard long time run (as anaconda jsonserver will kill himself after long periods of inactivity).\nMy guess is that Python3 + Jedi + Some libraries just go nuts. I really appreciate your effort with the screenshots but what I need are logs that can give me some clue about where the problem can be.\nIf you can start the JsonServer in Debug mode, it will gives us lot of useful information next time that this happens to you.\n.

Hi, notice that the resident real memory size if the image in the system is 1.4G, anyway, let's see what the Debug gives us.\n. Are you using the same Python interpreter when you run it manually?\n. I can't make any of my anaconda installations in both OS X and GNU/Linux to go nuts with the ram so I can't reproduce the problem in any consistent way. \nAbout the process running smoothly when jsonserver_debug is True that has not much sense as nothing makes special to run it manually or just let the anaconda plugin to spawn the process (as far as the same interpreter is being used).\nIn fact, the only part of anaconda that takes into account the jsonserver_debug variable at all is in the ST3 side of the plugin. That makes me think that there is some environmental problem as I am not able to reproduce it even using monster libraries like PySide or NumPy.\nTry to start the server manually using the -e for the extra_paths parameter using the path to your project as well to make sure the command being run is exactly the same.\n. Hi @nfantone \nYup, I did consider it, that is the reason why I asked about pass the -e flag with the path of the project being working on.\nI never had any problem of memory consumption or crashes in none of my boxes and they run for months, hard to locate/debug/fix.\n. @DanielPaikoffVSolvit, @nfantone, @gukoff, @fishtek, @leiserfg and @mrmachine has been more than one year now since the last entry on this issue.\nAny updates here or can I close it?\n. Nope as no updates? or\nNope as no more problems? or \nNope as no do not close it?\n. PyCharm? really? I always found it slow as hell. Ok, no updates from you :+1: \n. @nfantone how do you think I should test an issue that I was never able to reproduce myself?\n. I do that in every single release but thank you for your suggestions very appreciated :+1: \nClosing this and marking it as no replicable \n. @qocu and @robmcmullen can any of you please open another ticket for this?\nBy the way, I need to know on which operating systems do you experience the problems, I guess that @qocu  is on Linux as he mention strace what about you @robmcmullen?\nBy the way, @robmcmullen loos like Jedi is going totally rogue in your logs, which Python interpreter did you have configured as python_interpreter?\n. I don't think we can add icons to the tabs in Sublime Text\n. Not in the horizon, sorry mate.\n. Anaconda disables itself from work in source code that is not Python/Code using the functions defined in here and here I think is perfectly possible.\nSaid that, I am not working with Python since eight months ago so I am not using anaconda myself too much lately. That means that Pull Requests are welcome :)\n. Sorry, my fault, last release (just pushed) should solve it \n. Can you explain what you mean?\n. Working perfectly fine for me, are you sure that you have configured a Python3 interpreter to be used by anaconda?\nP.S: Maybe your definition of \"recognize\" and mine is just different, for me means that it's parsed with no lint errors.\n. Don't worry, we are all humans after all.\nRegards.\n. Hi. There is a bug in ST3 itself that makes anaconda behave weird with the import. Take a look at ethe project README https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda#auto-complete-for-import-behaves-badly\nI also suggest you to take a look at the Autocompletion documentation\n. I think is much better if you activate the autocompletion in dot support.\n. @rvong that is a Sublime Text 3 feature, it has to work if you created the file in the right directory and you don't have any other plugin overriding that configuration (remember that SublimeCode Intel totally interfere with Anaconda and other plugins as well so if you have installed it, disable it and test it again).\n@LucianKaltz that's not true, anaconda doesn't parse the whole file to autocomplete so it doesn't matters if the file has a few lines or thousands. The autocompletion is limited by what Jedi can eat and I think it can eat a lot.\n. Every single time that anyone had those kind of problems was Sublime Code Intel, maybe there are other plugins that I don't know about that also interferes with anaconda. Take into account that anaconda doesn't fire it's own auto-completion mechanism but hooks into the regular Sublime Text 3 auto-completion mechanism itself so anything that interfere into the Sublime Text default auto-completion will interfere into anaconda as well.\n. You need to add the \"sublime.py\" and \"sublime_plugin.py\" locations as an extra path in your project configuration. Take a look into the configuration for more information.\n. Probably same issue than #314, take a look on that issue as there is some workarounds.\n. Let me guess, big project with lot of files and big libraries?\n. Which ones are those dependencies?\n. Do you have mccabe, jedi, pep8 and pyflakes installed in your environment for some special reason?\n. Anaconda includes it's own versions of all those libraries (except for flake8), have locally installed versions of those libraries doesn't necessarily have to break it but we saw in the past that have a local version of Jedi interfered with how anaconda works.\nAnaconda uses specific versions of all those libraries, I repeat, it shouldn't affect but in general is not a good idea to bypass the versions contained into anaconda_lib directory as anaconda expects specific features and/or versions of the libraries that empowers it.\nTake a look at your $HOME/.cache/jedi/<your_project_name>/anaconda_jsoserver.log file\n. That is something to review, for now, just take a look at the log file that I commented about in the previous answer, maybe the problem is totally unrelated :) \n. This looks like there is some library probably crashing the Python interpreter, I am afraid that you will have to start the server in debug mode to can figure out where the problem is.\nTake a look to this section of the configuration file where it is explained how to make it work (remember to restart sublime text 3 before and after the debug test).\n. I am afraid that you need to start the JsonServer in debug mode in order to get all the information that we need to can follow the problem to it's root, take a look on my previous answer on this issue discussion.\n. Any updates here @Grokzen and @glenfant ?\n. I am glad that you didn't had any more problems, let's wait to see what @glenfant feedback is \n. OK, feel free to open it if you experience more issues \n. Hi\nTake a look at the configuration examples. The tests runner is an addition to the package from one of our users, I am not that familiar with it myself as I always use the command line to run tests as I am really comfortable with the terminal.\n. What happens if you run the \"Run full project tests suite\"?\n.

Ouch!\nMarked for next release\n. Hi. Try uninstalling any version of Jedi that you have installed yourself and make sure that your configured Python interpreter path is right.\n. Hi.\nIndeed, that would be a really good addition to the plugin but ST3 has a really poor and basic support for what we can display and how we can display anything in those tooltips. Parsing the reStructuredText using Sphinx will produce HTML code that ST3 is not able to render in the tooltips and is gonna ends with HTML tags all around.\nA much deeper system must be develop to support that into anaconda to avoid the ST3 limitations and currently is not possible for me to dedicate that much time to the plugin \n. And how Jedi or PyFlakes would know what is in your scope after you poluted it with everything that is defined in the modules that you import all from them?\n. Well, anaconda bases it's autocompletion/docs in Jedi, Jedi will be able to analyze whatever is visible by the Python interpreter that is running the JsonServer but the linting is not gonna work to identify undefined elements in your code.\nMake sure the python interpreter that you defined in your configuration is able to see whatever library that you are trying to auto-complete.\n. Well, seems like is just happening what I already told you in my first answer, Jedi has no way to know that the context object is part of the pwn module when you use * import as Jedi does a lexical analysis of the python code without executing it (that means that it doesn't import it neither) so specific names should be in your file text for Jedi can process them.\npython\nimport jedi\njedi.Script('''from pwn import *\ncontext(''').completions()\n[]\n.

That happened some times to me in the past, I never discovered why Jedi wasn't giving me back results about some symbols, the problem was pretty inconsistent as well so I wasn't always able to reproduce it.\n. No changes were made to the linters, can you grep for that error to see if you had it before the update?\n. I never replicated this error myself, I am calling for feed back here as a commit was made on Nov the 12th of past year so I still don't know if I can close this issue or not.\n. Done\n. Those two lines are just JsonServer noticing that the ST3 process is not active anymore so it kill itself to return the resources to the system.\nMy questiona are:\n- This happened only once after the update or can you just reproduce it in a consistent way? \n- The JsonServer killed himself or got stalled?\n. That's so weird I've been using version 1.4.11rc1 for one week before release it and I didn't had any problem like that, the only real change is an upgrade to the Jedi library.\nCan you try to start the JsonServer manually and set your Anaconda in debug mode as is explained in here?\n. I did a cleaner installation today as I just reinstalled my iMac with a new and fresh copy of Yosemite, installed ST3 and anaconda 1.4.11 from Package Control and I didn't experienced any issue yet.\nYou don't get any message in the terminal that you used to run it? It spits lots of information to the terminal that doesn't appears in the logs when you run it manually.\n. Probably is the auto format in save, try to disable it. I will take a look at this problem as I also hit it in anaconda_go there should be something wrong as the event is processed asynchronously and provably the event gets fired in a loop if the auto format is not fast enough\n. I don't think linters could be the culprits here, they are fast and light enough, but 0.05 is probably too low. You can always take a look at your system processes when this happens again to see which processes are consuming your resources.\n. Hi, sorry for the delay. Documentation updates must be done in this other repo\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda.github.io\n. Couldn't reproduce it\n. Hi.\nI still can't reproduced that behavior in none of my boxes so it's really hard to fix something that I can't test. I've seen the video and I agree that's pretty annoying.\nWhich other plugins do you have installed in your Sublime Text along with anaconda?\nWhile we find the possible cause for that behavior in your environment you will want to disable the tooltips setting enable_signatures_tooltip\": false at any of your configuration levels.\n. I guess the expand action fires the on_modified trigger in Sublime Text 3, not much that can be done in anaconda really. \n. The tooltip is shown after a successful linting of the buffer, the linter is triggered on modifications if you have it configured to run always in the background.\n. Oh, you are right, I forgot that I decoupled that functionality and now is independent from the linting process.\n.

The only explanation is that your configured interpreter path is wrong or is being override in a more specific configuration level.

We need much more information to even start to look at this issue. A copy of your ST3 python console log and the contents of your cache anaconda-jsonserver log is needed.\nThe logs can be found in:\n- Linux: ~/.cache/jedi//anaconda_jsonserver.log\n- Windows: %APPDATA%\\Jedi\\Jedi\\anconda_jsonserver.log\n- OS X: ~/Library/Caches/Jedi//anaconda_jsonserver.log\nA guess with no more information is that the Sublime Text 3 python socket is not able to connect to your localhost\n. Hi @clawoflight \nAs I guessed seems like your ST3 embedded Python interpreter is not able to connect to your localhost, that can happen because two resons:\n1. The localhost address is not accessible for any reason\n2. The Sublime Text 3 is unable to start the JsonServer\nI assume that you are under GNU/Linux (as per the ~/.cache/jedi in your answer) so make sure you have a valid entry to localhost in your /etc/hosts file (something like 127.0.0.1       localhost) \nTo check if your ST3 Python embedded interpreter is able to connect to localhost follow the steps below:\n1. Install netcat if you don't have it already (sudo apt-get install netcat for debian based, sudo pacman -S netcat for ArchLinux based, sudo yum install netcat in RedHat based or emerge --ask --verbose netcat in Gentoo based)\n2. Open a terminal window and write: nc -l -p 1234 that will make netcat to listen to anything that is sent to the port 1234 in your local machine\n3. Open the Sublime Text 3 console and write: import socket; s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM); s.connect(('localhost', 1234)); s.send(bytes('Hello World!\\n', 'utf8')); s.close()\nIf your ST3 can connect to your local machine you will get a Hello World! in your terminal and the netcat that we did set up earlier will be now closed.\nTest that and come back with the result.\n. Can you check if there is one (ore m ore) jsonserver.py process in your system using ps aux | grep jsonserver.py?\nCan you paste a full ST3 console log report into a gist or pastebin like?\n. Can remove/disable SublimeLinter and try again?\n. Well, anaconda should be able to work for any project out of the box. ST3 added some kind of cache bug in recent versions that some times affect in very weird circumstances the way that anconda loads and detects your project files.\nProbably is related with that, unfortunately when this problem appears is really hard to diagnose it or even replicate so it's showing himself as a very hard to detect/fix problem. I guess you can close this if you both are satisfied.\n. Why your ~/.cache/jedi directory was owned by root?\n. Probably your localhost was resolving to the wrong address or to the IPV6 version\n. Did you try with C:\\\\Python27\\\\Python.exe?\n. You should use \\\\ as path separator for your interpreter, anyway, is there any errors in the console?. That's not WAI, the auto completion box should appear by himself. Said\nthat, take into account that anaconda does not fire the auto completion box\nbut hooks into regular ST3 one.\nOn 3 Aug 2015 15:02, \"Mateus Dalto Piveta\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi, it's actually a question: when I type \"from\" + space, the suggestions\ndoesn't appears.

Bad indentation is PEP8 violation E114, you shouldn't get any complaint from anaconda about that if you configure your sublime text to use 4 spaces as tabs, you can also disable E114 from the pep8 errors but I wouldn't do that.\nWhat are the \"other errors\" that you spoke about in your previous comment? Anaconda doesn't parse comments contents.\n. The comment is part of the document structure, if your document structure has a violation, it's gonna be linted, as I said, if you don't want to get a lint about a document structure violation just add the violation code to the pep8_ignore list.\n. The E303 has nothing to do with the comment but with too many blank lines in the document.\nYou can add E266 and E265 to the pep8_ignore list in the settings and anaconda will ignore them.\n. So busy lately, I need to put this together in a next release but life has the annoying habit of crossing in front of things...\n. I think this was fix in #481 \nFeel free to open if the problem persist. Couldn't reproduce this, it works fine for me \n. I don't think you need the extra_path, anaconda will be able to see whatever your configured interpreter  can see with no additions, try to remove it from your configuration, restart ST3 and try again.\nSome users have reported strange behavior with ST3 since one of their last releases, in some cases, users needed to delete the ST3 cache completely to make things works, I don't thinks that is the case in here but is something to take into account.\n. Can you retrieve the documentation for the object that you want to jump more than once? Is there anything in the ST3 console logs? Anything in the JsonServer logs?\n. You can find logs depending on your operating system on:\n- Linux: ~/.cache/jedi//anaconda_jsonserver.log\n- OS X: ~/Library/Caches/Jedi//anaconda_jsonserver.log\n- Windows: %APPDATA%\\Jedi\\Jedi\\\\anaconda_jsonserver.log\n.

I got some time after lunch to test this again. I created a new virtual environment using Python3 were I installed django and mongoengine to replicate Scenarios 1 to 4.\nbash\n$\u00a0pip freeze\nDjango==1.9.7\nmongoengine==0.10.6\npymongo==3.2.2\nScenario 1\n- I created a new django project using django-admin startproject mysite\n- I opened the mysite directory with ST3\n- I saved new project with project settings:\njson\n{\n    \"build_systems\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"file_regex\": \"^[ ]*File \\\"(...*?)\\\", line ([0-9]*)\",\n            \"name\": \"Anaconda Python Builder\",\n            \"selector\": \"source.python\",\n            \"shell_cmd\": \"\\\"/home/damnwidget/.virtualenvs/django/bin/python\\\" -u \\\"$file\\\"\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"folders\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"path\": \".\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"settings\":\n    {\n        \"python_interpreter\": \"~/.virtualenvs/django/bin/python\"\n    }\n}\n- I did open mysite/mysite/urls.py\n- I added from django.contrib.auth.models import User and User.check() a couple of lines after the import\nResults:\n- goto definition for package level works every time\n- goto definition for User in both the import line or the User.check() line works every time\nScenario 2\n- I added new line import mongoengine\nResults:\nGoto definition for the package worked every time\nScenario 3\n- I added new line mongoengine.StringField()\nResults:\n- goto definition in the package level worked every time\n- goto definition in StringField() worked every time\nScenario 4\n- I tested anaconda code itself that is the only Python project that I am currently maintaining/working on \nResults:\n- goto definition in package level worked every time\n- goto definition in class, methods, etc worked every time\nScenario 5\nI repeated all the above using a new virtual environment using Python 2.7.11\nTest env. characteristics\n\nOS: Manjaro 16.06-pre1 Daniella\nST3: Build 3114\nAnaconda Versions: v1.4.26 and v2.0.0-rc1\nPlugins: anaconda, anaconda_rust, anaconda_php, JSON Reindent, Origami, Project Manager, Package Control\n\nI am not using any virtual machine or fancy configuration\nResolution: Not replicable\nProbably environmental issue\n. @aaakbar if you don't want to spend time in something that probably is fixed in v2.0.0 (as all the code involving remote environment integration has been rewritten in v2.0.0-rc1) checkout the v2.0.0-rc1 branch and take a look at the new documentation for vagrant environments in version 2, there is a flexible \"remote worker\" as well, take a look at the Anaconda v2 documentation in general in the wiki and give it a try.\nA new feature of anaconda's v2 remote workers (included vagrant ones) is that you can map directories to fix or minimize the problems with Goto Definition and other related commands.\n. Probably worth a look at #562 . Probably a miss configured python path when you are not using the debug mode, we've seen this problem before and thee culprit was always that.\nMake sure that you have a valid python interpreter configured as your python_interpreter in all your configuration levels.\n. Sorry guys, I've been really busy lately, I will make a fast release with these changes as soon as possible\n. Looking at the suggested solution, I am not sure if I want to reload the whole sys module, it scares me a bit\n. This should not be a problem anymore. Hi. Are you 100% sure that you can connect to localhost from the Sublime Text 3 python embedded interpreter?\n. If you can connect from the embedded Sublime Text 3 interpreter (using the ST3 console) to the JsonServer there is nothing that could prevent anaconda to do the same, in fact, if that is happening to you, there is really nothing that I can do about, the package just start the JsonServer process in your machine in the port N and then connect's to it, that simple.\nIf that is really your problem, my only suggestion is to deinstall your ST3 completely removing anything in /Users/coltonprovias/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3\n. Well guys, Sublime Text is not an IDE, it doesn't support much of  the base\nfeatures that you need to do things like that, we already support a popup\nsystem showing documentation about the objects that you are working with\nand it's not 100% perfect as it's buggy with UTF-8 characters like chinesse\nor russian with no an easy/good enough solution in the horizon.\nThere are things that just can't be, if people needs an IDE to work with\nPython, is better they move to Intelli or Eclipse as ST3 is not intended to\nbe an IDE but a powerful text editor, Anaconda just adds a bit of taste in\nthe top of that but it wasn't ever my intention to replace any IDE just add\nsome features that I did feel right to be in ST3\nOn 20 September 2015 at 19:44, Oleksandr notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHere the main convenience is that the information in the pop-up window of\nthe class (Django/Model).\nThe file is actually not always have to open a new window, often I want to\nquickly view and/or a copy from the pop-up field name from the model\nexample is especially important when it is not triggered completion\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/371#issuecomment-141820478\n.\n\n\nJoin the Free Software Foundation and become Free as in Freedom\n.

I am not sure why but I didn't got any notification for this issue until today (you posted it like past month). I don't understand exactly what the problem is, can you elaborate please?\n. I did some tests and seem like the EventListener fires the on_load method when ST3 is pre-loading the buffer while you write the file name in the Ctrl+P text input so the buffer is not in an state that can be linted by anaconda.\nThen, when the user press enter a new view is attached to a new tab but the buffer is already pre-loaded on it and the on_load method is not called anymore.\nI don't think there is much to be done in our end to fix it.\n.

That is because you didn't saved the file after the first rename and Jedi makes it changes in the saved file in the file system, if you save the file you get the right behavior. The only solution is to force ST3 to save the new buffer after the rename, not sure if I want to do that, probably is fine but I think is a bit intrusive.\n. Yes, ST3 do it but Jedi, the library that we use to support big part of our functionality doesn't\n. Can we close this?\n. Hi. In your config, the settings is a list and it should be a dictionary\n\"settings\":\n{\n    \"anaconda_gutter_theme\": \"alpha\",\n    \"anaconda_linting\": true,\n    \"pep8_ignore\": [\n        \"E501\",\n        \"E303\"\n    ],\n    \"python_interpreter\": \"~/.virtualenvs/py3/bin/python3.5\"\n}\nI am not sure about the shell_cmd fix first the other stuff and let's see\n. I am not sure to understand what your problem is @DaZzz I see  no anaconda options at all in your configuration...\n. @nicebug  take a look at this answer in StackOverflow\n. I guess that should be something possible to implement but I don't think that is a good idea as we can end up with multiple JsonServer copies using multiple interpreters for the same ST3 window and that is against the current package architecture so a full redesign of the package should be accomplish and the waste of resources could be huge.\n. As you can see in the attached screenshot, is working perfectly fine with last version v1.4.15\n\n. First thing first\nWhich Sublime Text Build you are using?\nWhich anaconda version?\nWhich options are you using for the linter?\nHow do you know is \"crashing\"?\nDo you have any log file that we can read?\nThanks.\n. Thank you for the details I will take a look into it as soon as I can.\n. I can not replicate this behavior.\n\nAnyone else is having this problem?\n. Are you are able to find any Super+Shift+T shortcut in anaconda for Mac OS X? That is amazing as there is no such shortcut for Mac OS X into anaconda.\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/master/Default%20(OSX).sublime-keymap\nProbably is another package the one that is causing you those problems.\n. To be released in v1.4.16\n. Did you test this with the two current mainstream python versions?\n. The use of \"(\" has special meanings into anaconda depending of the user settings, is needed for the plugin in order to trigger some events, if the plugin places these by himself it can lead to missconfigured installations with bizarre behavior\n. Goto Definition is working fine for me even using star imports, by the way.\nIf you pollute the global scope with an star import how do you want the lexical analyzer to know what exists in the scope and what doesn't? The linter is gonna be unable to properly detect undefined variables in your scripts.\nPEP8 already forbid from use from x import * and is documented as a bad practice. That is supposed to be used when it gives you real benefits.\n. To be review on next release\n. The exception seem to happen in the poll call itself, probably that code has some special meaning for the socket.\n. To be review on next release\n. Can't replicate\n\n. Mysteries of the life, it always worked for me. Closing this :)\n. Seems like your Python interpreter is set to an empty string. Set it to a valid Python binary.\n. Sorry for the delay, I've been busy with life things. Point your python interpreter t the python interpreter that you are working with.\nA good start will be to read the regarding documentation in http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/\n. This was fixed, no one closed it.\n. To be review in next release\n. Unfortunately I don't have too much time to work in anaconda since some time ago, new features take a lot of time to be implemented as I always give priority to bug fixes. I will take a look at that project as soon as I can but if feel free to investigate in your own behalf, any contribution is really appreciated.\n. Hi, I will try to take a look as soon as I can\n. Can you check if this issue has been fixed with yesterday release?\n. Anaconda uses autopep8 in order to automatically solve PEP8 problems in your files, AutoPEP8 is a great and complex tool with lot of complex algorithms that parse the file and modify it returning back a pep8 violations free buffer string.\nSaid that, AutoPEP8 has some known limitations:\n- It can't work with buffers so a real file need to be passed to it\n- It is not the fastest application on earth\nAnaconda solves the first point making your buffer read only, saving it and using it with AutoPEP8 in order to try to solve the PEP8 issues on it, while anaconda is waiting for AutoPEP8 to do it's work, your buffer is read only so you can't continue working as any change that you do to the file will be lost when anaconda get's a response from the app.\nThe second problem is solved using timeouts in our callbacks (as anaconda is asynchronous) the default value for autoformatting is one second and it can be changed in the configuration file in order to allow to AutoPEP8 to finish it's work before timeout and discard it's return (when return is available).\njson\n    /*\n        Timeout for the autoformatting tool before fail\n        Note: Take into account that depending on the size of the file you\n        want to autoformat, this can take a while\n    */\n    \"auto_formatting_timeout\": 1,  // seconds\nI don't know if that line is simple enough but in any case is an autopep8 problem so maybe you would like to raise your concerns in their project site here on Github\n. Can't reproduce it.\n\nProbably there is something else in your system that produces that behaviour.\n. Well, is hard to me to give you an answer about a possible bug in the\nSublime Text 3 C++ code itself, and even harder taking into account that I\nam not able to reproduce that behavior\nOn 13 January 2016 at 15:54, jongiddy notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIt appears that a C++ dependency of Sublime somehow doesn't like the\nresponse:\nAbout push back to ST3: {\"doc\": \"sigdif.significnt_digits\\nsignificnt_digits(x, n)Round a float to a number of significant digitshttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3410976/how-to-round-a-number-to-significant-figures-in-python\", \"uid\": \"84d1899f55df4a51b9e5f72722bef60a\", \"success\": true}\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'\n  what():  vector::_M_range_insert\nAborted (core dumped)\nWith no symbols in the binary, it's hard to make out what exactly is\nfailing.\nFor the record, this is on Ubuntu 14.04.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/419#issuecomment-171340454\n.\n\n\nJoin the Free Software Foundation and become Free as in Freedom\n. Any updates here @jongiddy ?\n. Probably related with the crash in tooltips that they fixed as well. Closing this for now, open it again if you have to in the future\n. Anaconda uses AutoPEP8 (that is a 3rd party dependency) to implement the auto formatting feature, unfortunately autopep8 doesn't accept a string as input but a file in the filesystem, this is why anaconda saves your buffer after format your file.\nI understand that you have enabled the autoformat on save option and that is why you are expecting that behavior. I would like to do some modifications to the overall autoformatting behavior, I will take a look into this issue that you just did rise as well.\n. resolved, will be live in next release\n. You are welcome\n. Try\njson\n{\n    \"python_interpreter\": \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Autodesk\\\\Maya2014\\\\bin\\\\mayapy.exe\",\n[...]\n}\n. Well, I don't know what to tell you, there are loads of people using spaces in their paths with no issue. Can you paste your ST3 console log at least?\n. Ok, so I am understanding that this issue is only when you use the Ctrl+B to build the file?\n. Can you paste the content of your \"build_systems\" configuration?\n. No it doesn't. That feature could be implemented but the overhead could be too much If several different interpreters are defined in the shebangs, apart from that, if someone opens a file with a shebang that doesn't exists in the system, anaconda will fail unable to start a JsonServer in order to lint, autocomplete, etc. So it is a bit risky as well\n. Do you see any logs in the sublime text console?\n. Anything in ~Library/Cache/Jedi/?\n. To be added in next release\n. I am doing a release today with more verbose and useful information, I also added this wiki page that after the release anaconda will point to when these kind of errors get raised.\n. There is some cache bug going on since ST3 3087 that get fixed reinstalling the plugin or ST3 but that's totally out of our control unfortunately \n. Thank you @pradyunsg \n. That is a limitation of Jedi itself, Jedi only knows about modules that are imported in your file, In my case it just fails with \"namedtuple can't be found\" it shouldn't open any new blank document.\n. Do yo see anything in the Sublime Text console log? Anything in the JsonServer logs?\n. Take a look at /Users/balkan/Library/Cache/Jedi\n. Sorry for the delay, this seems to be a problem in Jedi itself \n. Oh but it has to be present https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/42cee33b1603a21855e5776f63a64021d8c8e4e7/anaconda_server/commands/doc.py#L46\nCan you tell me about what configuration do you have for your enable_signatures_tooltip?\n. That's so weird...\n. I am not able to replicate myself\n\n. I don't think so as I am using Manjaro (Arch based) and installed it just with pacman and everything looks fine, try to reinstall the package.\n. I did check it again and, in fact it doesn't have any documentation at all (but still don't get the exception in your log).\n\nThe docstring in the first screenshot has to be some residual string that was cached \n. Closing it\n. Are you using a Python3 interpreter?\n. Write this in your ST3 console and paste here the result, if the result is just python paste here the result of write the command type python in your terminal app.\npython\nimport anaconda\nanaconda.anaconda_lib.helpers.get_settings(view, 'python_interpreter')\n. Any feedback here?\n. You can add it with no problems but it will probably get overwritten if you change your python_interpreter. My suggestion is to probably copy the structure of the Anaconda Python Builder and create your own modifying the name so Anaconda will not overwrite it ever.\n. In your project file (if you have one)\n. If you don't use a project, you don't run anaconda's builder but Sublime Text 3 one. \nI recommend that you take a look at ST3 documentation (unofficial but really good) here:\nhttp://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/build_systems.html\nThen read anaconda's own doc here:\nhttp://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda\n. If you don't have a project, Anaconda's Python builder shouldn't even appear in the list of builders.\n. Well that is because scope.py is not part of a package (as his parent has not be loaded) so it's normal that you get the import error as anaconda has no clue about how to import it into your current file.\n. Sorry for the delay, being honest I totally forgot about this issue. I can't replicate it myself. Are you still experiencing the same behavior?\n\n. This is probably related to #488 (possibly a duplicate). I released a fix for #488 that could probably fix this issue as well, can you confirm please?. @QasimK I will release a new version with specific fixes for this issue, I could not reproduce the behaviour expressed by @FrnkVieira in https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/432#issuecomment-260044701 after the fix\nSo to resume, v2.1.10 will be fixed. To be released in next version\n. This is how GutterColor is doing it https://github.com/ggordan/GutterColor/blob/997786d07b4725c09c16a4250ff12af6b463edaf/gutter_color.py#L79-L122\nAnaconda doesn't set the theme for the gutter marks, just the icon type so I am not sure how you can apply that fix to any theme as I think that GutterColor is a key thay is set for regions directly by GutterColor plugin itself in here https://github.com/ggordan/GutterColor/blob/a40e4b444a631ef744d9d78e54ea0dff0ea7cfa0/line.py#L276.\n. Anaconda creates regions for every kind of severity, you can see the related code here https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/anaconda_lib/linting/sublime.py#L227-L237\nYou can find the regions that anaconda creates in the wiki https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Linting-theme-customization\n. I am a bit busy since a couple of years ago xDD, can you do a pull request?\n. Unless Sublime Text reports .less files as Python code, anaconda is not even active during its edition. All the functions return without executing their body as the file being edited is not Python.\nDid you try to remove anaconda as well and try?\n. Make sure that you don't have some kind of LESS highlight messing around I can't reproduce this myself (because it has no sense at all).\n\n. Mypy support will be added as optional (disabled by default) in v2.0.0\n. Feature implemented, waiting for v2.0.0 release\n. That is because autoimport and completion/documentation are two different subsystems, let's say that autoimport is a complicated feature to implement and my implementation is not the best in the world, there are plans to improve it but I didn't had enough time to do it yet.\n. That is because sys.exit is a built-in python function written in C language so it's compiled into the Python binary (or one shared library) as machine code so anaconda has no way to jump to the definition of that code.\nYou can see the sys.exit implementation here https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/sysmodule.c#L261\n. Did you try to run tests fro other test suites after applying this patch?\n. The main problem here is that I never used this feature as it was introduced by an anaconda user long ago, I just fixed some parts of it but I am not really aware of how it works (I am a terminal guy so I run my tests using a slide down type terminal like iTerm2 and Yakuake).\nI will be really happy if you could make some tests with other test tools before to merge this PR.\n. To be released in next version\n. Unfortunately this PR broke the tests runner for other users so I am doing a rollback.\nMore info https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/475\n. No, the NameError exception is raised if the sublime module is not imported, what I can't remember now is why I added the ValueError exception in there. I should probably import json always independently of sublime being imported or not\n. Make sure that in your configuration the name of the theme is lowercase, solution in any case could be to convert anything that is contained in the anaconda_gutter_theme to lowercase instead of rename the themes to capitalize them.\nAnyway, your problem is that you named it capitalized in your config file.\n. Can't replicate, make sure your configured interpreter is set to a valid python3 interpreter.\n\n. Oh, sorry, I didn't noticed about the future import (crazy days at work). Unfortunately this is still not replicable.\n\n. That is because you installed it from PackageControl, in that case the package name is Anaconda and not anaconda. About the issue itself:\n1. Which linter are you using?\n2. Do you have a local version of PyFlakes or pep8 installed in your environment? If you have, please, consider to remove it, anaconda pack's its own versions (you can also create a virtual environment that will not use your system packages and use it as your anaconda isolated interpreter, then you can install whatever library that you need completion support for in that environment)\n. Any feedback here?\n. Here you have all the regions that anconda creates: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Linting-theme-customization\n. All the section names where already in the first link that I did post, but thanks.\n. I couldn't reproduce the behavior that you described in this PR description, anaconda always delete old linter marks when the linter runs independently of which configuration is used for check_linting_behaviour or anaconda_linter_persistent.\nI did check with every possible combination of those two setting parameters and the linter behavior was always correct.\n. I don't understand what you are trying to show here. You just wrote invalid lines one after other in a python file, then when you saved the file, the linter ran and lint all those lines as they were invalid code.\nWhich behavior are you expecting?\n. Ok, I got ya\n. I made some changes to the PR it will be released with the next release if you want to get the changes immediately just install anaconda directly from git using the last master.\n. Did you tried to install Shiboken?\n. I can't replicate this issue as it is described in the issue report, this is a completion before a for the set a value using the self pointer:\n\nAnd this is after assigning a value:\n\nAs you can see there is no problem. Can I have a copy of that file?\n. That is because for some reason the jedi library thinks that self after that operation is a boolean (don't ask me why) you should take a look at the Jedi project issues tracker and report it there if is not reported already.\nAs you know Python is a dynamic language, in order to offer auto completion, some heavy lexical parsing and operations are performed by Jedi (that doesn't executes the code in the buffer and that is an awesome achievement from them) as some type need to be infered in order to determine which methods and properties could be defined on the word under the cursor. \n. No problem, I will maintain this open until they fix it and we update the library in anaconda (probably months).\n. I will update Jedi as soon as that commit gets merged into the Jedi's master branch\n. I think I can close this as the change has been long included into anaconda, feel free to reopen if there is any problem\n. Jedi (the library that anaconda uses internally to suggest completions) doesn't seems to give any completion for that code. \nTake look in jedi's project page to see if there is already an issue addressing this problem, if not, you can just open a new one.\n. Hi, I completely missed this issue.\nThe settings are separate because some people like Anaconda to draw boxes surrounding the affected lines code and underline under the specific parts of the line that are affected.\nMark styles and underlines are two separate ST3 regions as well.\n. That is not an easy thing to do as the line to work will need to inherit the context/scope from your script so it need to do imports etc etc. Do you know of any editor that implement that feature already? (and it works)\n. Did anyone tried out this package? https://github.com/spywhere/Terminality\n. Is your anaconda's python interpreter configured to use a Python3 interpreter?\n. http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/#toc_3\n. I guess is because almost every single line on that file contains a PEP8 violation, you would probably want to increment the timeout (1s by default) for the auto_formatting_timeout setting in your Anaconda settings.\nTry something like 5s and increment it in multiples of two until you find a sweet spot, AutoPEP8 is a great tool but not the fastest on planet.\n. That is because that is not \"your build system\" is anaconda's one, if you want to add your own, add a new entry as anaconda is always gonna overwrite it's own build system using whatever python interpreter that is set as value for the python_interpreter option var.\n. There are some known issues with numpy (and other mathematical packages) in Jedi library (that we use internally to offer autocompletion), you can see a list here https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/search?q=numpy&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93\n. Hi @samson333 \nYou should be able to use whatever anaconda feature just in Python code, you won't be able to use it in any C code.\n. Anaconda uses the Jedi library to provide auto-completion and docstrings, as far as I know if your library can be imported as a Python library, your anaconda should be able to complete and offer docstrings if your configured python interpreter is able to see/import that libraries.\n. I don't understand what u mean, sorry. You mean in the editor buffer?\n. Try to add the Python interpreter as absolute path /Users/bigtyme/anaconda/envs/py2k/bin/python, OS X is known to do weird things when the parent process of ST3 doesn't include BASH variables like for example run it from spotlight, that is not directly related but it can be affecting the build system.\n. Sorry to don't be more helpful here\n. Set pyflakes_ignore_import_* as true in your anaconda settings, in fact, it should be true by default.\n. I never had any problem with E123, can you provide more information but your environment? A snippet of code where that problem happens could be helpful as well.\n. I can replicate it so I confirm this is a bug (a weird one btw).\n. Hi @p5gbryce \nSeems like that error is ignored by default by pep8 (https://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/1.4.6/intro.html look at the very bottom in the notes section). The thing is, if you add a --ignore=E#NUM when you use pep8 directly from the command line you get reports for those errors that are ignored by default.\nAnaconda was adding it's ignores to the default ignores from pep8 (anaconda uses pep8 as a library and doesn't call it from the command line). I made some modifications to replicate the pep8 behaviour.\nIt will be available in the next release (hopefully this week).\n. Thank you :)\n. What you mean with \"there are no changes to show?\". That is one of those error messages that you should never get, and I am seriously here, never.\nIs there any more logs in the console?\nWhich operating system and versions of everythign are you using?\n. Closing it then\n. If you check in your ~/Library/Cache/Jedi/ directory logs you will find something like The underlying Jedi library as raised an exception, seems to be a bug in Jedi (the library that anaconda uses to get documentation, signatures and autocompletion), at least in the version that we are currently using.\nObviously it only affects Python3 as that syntax is incorrect in Python2. I will take a look in deeper detail as soon as I can.\n. Seems like is an already known bug in Jedi -> https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/707\n. @Cescfangs this was fixed by Jedi and is not affecting anaconda anymore, anyway, can you confirm and close the issue?\nThanks.\n. The traceback is not related with auto completion being disabled but with anaconda being unable to connect to your local host. Check that your ST3 is able to connect to your local host using \"localhost\" as address.\nBtw anaconda and ycm both use the same library to offer auto completion (jedi library) so there is not much benefit to use ycm auto completion over anaconda one as they should have the same capabilities, the only difference is that anaconda has been around for a while already.\n. I am thinking in add another plugin \"anaconda_rust\" as I am doing some things in rust now in my free time so probably we will have native support for it in some moment in the future.\n. Hi @olipratt \nFirst let me thank you for your interest in make anaconda better, I really appreciate it, I am currently the only developer taking care of the project and since a couple of years ago I don't have too much time to work in new features and bug fixes.\nAbout the first dead link that you found in the developers documentation, well, that's my fault, I never did set up that template and I never prepared the testing environment (I never added tests) something that I have to do in some moment (or someone else that have the time and want to do it) as test ST3 plugins is hard, and test anaconda is even harder given it's asynchronous nature.\nThe second link, well, I don't know what happened there but the Development Project Configuration is fully described for GNU/Linux, OS X and Windows at the bottom of Getting Involved chapter, something that I will probably fix.\nAnyway, I recommend you to read the rest of the documentation (it's not a step by step tutorial) it will give you a much better understanding of how the plugin works.\nI till take a look at your PR later.\nThanks again.\n. @olipratt I had to apply a hotfix after release this morning\nYou can find the hotfix code in this commit we were sloppy, we have to test every change in both Python2 and Python3 \n. Well, we both have to be, I had to review this PR and other ones more carefully. Don't worry too much about, and thank you again, contributions are highly appreciated.\n. Yeah, that is something that we can do, I am starting to add unit tests anyway, let me see if I remember how to edit that gitbook :)\n. Hi @olipratt \nI wrote some tests to test the JsonServer side of the plugin, to run them just use tox like\ntox --skip-missing-interpreters\nI am actually using py26, py27, py33, py35, pypy and pypy3 \n. Looks good, thank you for your contribution.\n. Hi @Gabriel-p yeah we changed some specific pep8 behavior in the last update.\nJust to put you in context, the pep8 tool defines some errors as ignored by default, if you pass something in the --ignore flag, it then overrides the default ignored list in pep8 and it gives you messages about those errors (as you are not ignoring them).\nThat is a weird behavior if you ask me, but if you have been using pep8 you expect that behavior to be part of anaconda (in fact you didn't had any way before to make pep8 to inform you about some ignored by default errors in anaconda, no way at all).\nYou can follow the discussion about that change here\nYou can read a bit more about which errors are ignored by default in pep8 here\nThe solution is easy, just add those errors to your ignore list.\n. The last word to accept a Python Enhancement Proposals is as far as I know, Guido  Van Rossum one but if E226 is accepted part of PEP8 and that syntax is detected as a violation, I guess it's a violation doesn't matter if is suggested by Guido or not.\nIs up to you to ignore that PEP8 violation or not I guess :)\n. Anaconda uses the pep8 package from the Python Code Quality Authority but the pep8 tool itself is made following the PEP8 document itself\n. That sounds about right yeah\n. Hi @pkucmus \nI understand that it was working for you before or it never worked?\n. That's cool but I would prefer if we can go to the bottom of your issue and fix it as it can possibly \naffecting other users, I can't replicate it myself.\nCan you give me more information about your environment?\nWhich version of Python is the one in your virtualenv?\n. Looks like I broke Python2 support!!!!\n. Fix incoming guys \n. The fix will be available in Package Control in a few minutes.\nThank you for the quick feedback guys.\n. Fixed on version 1.4.21, please, update\n. Why don't you use that package directly?\n. There was this pull request related with tests.\nCan you paste any error in your ST3 console? The deactivate command is environmental dependent as far as I understand.\n. Can you rollback your anaconda to v1.4.18 and try that again?\nTo rollback anaconda just follow the steps below:\n1. Remove Anaconda package from your Sublime Text 3 using the Command Palette\n2. Close your Sublime Text 3\n3. Open a terminal and go to: cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/\n4. Clone anaconda repo: git clone https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda\n5. Checkout v1.4.18: git checkout v1.4.18\n. Ok, I am gonna rollback that PR today\n. @montegoode version 1.4.22 rollback PR #441, can you test it and close this ticket accordingly please?\n. I think I found the problem but I can't test it myself, I need you to edit a file in your anaconda installation and tell me if it solved your problem.\nOpen ~/Library/Aplication\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/Anaconda/commands/test_runner.py and change line 16 from:\npython\nCOMMAND_SEPARATOR = \"&\" if os.name == \"nt\" else \"&\"\nto:\npython\nCOMMAND_SEPARATOR = \"&\" if os.name == \"nt\" else \";\"\nCome back here and tell me if it worked for you.\nThanks\n. Hi, definitely that is a non expected behavior, I would need more information about your environment. I see that you are using Linux but I need as well:\n- Sublime Text 3 Version\n- Anaconda Version\n- Sublime Text 3 console logs\n- Anaconda JsonServer logs (you can find them in ~/.cache/jedi/anconda-3/anaconda_jsonserver.log\n. I am afraid that you need to start your JsonServer in debug mode to see what is happening as there is some exception but is not logged into the log file.\nTo do so you need to do a couple of things, follow the steps below \n1. Close Sublime Text 3 completely\n2. Run: python -B ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p test 9999 DEBUG\n3. Set jsonserver_debug as true and jsonserver_debug_port as 9999 in your Anaconda settings\n4. Start Sublime Text 3 and open any Python file\nYou will get whatever exception is occurring in the terminal that you did run the JsonServer manually, copy and paste it in pastebin or similar and come back.\nThanks\n. That is weird, seems like you have a html package in your Python2 path that is messing with the logic in the doc command.\nCan you start a python interpreter and give me the output of the following code?\npython\nimport html\nprint(html.__file__)\nprint(html.__doc__)\n. I have no idea what is that html package in your Python installation, can you do a pip freeze --all to see from where that package comes from? Also a python -c \"import html; print(html);\" would be nice.\n. That package doesn't appears in your pip freeze and is installed in your\nuser directory, can you check with IPython or opening the module directly\nin your ST3 which methods does it have? Doing a print(dir(html)) after\nimport it would be interesting too.\nOn 27 April 2016 at 21:20, Logi notifications@github.com wrote:\n\noutput of pip freeze --all: http://pastebin.com/4Sg4sAqr\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/476#issuecomment-215215823\n\n\nJoin the Free Software Foundation and become Free as in Freedom\n. Seems like that html module comes from python2-future provided by http://python-future.org that distributes an incomplete version of the Python3 html module as the unescape method is missing on it. I still don't understand why people continue creating these kind of packages that doesn't really solve the compatibility problems and break stuff.\nContinue this discussion in #477\n. @logileifs can you confirm that this issue is fixed for you and close it please?\n. No, thank you, I just created this plugin for personal use and you all made it great with your suggestions, ideas and contributions.\nI am closing this one, feel free to open it again if you need.\n. I already commented in the original \"flickering\" issue, here is the link to the comment: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/244#issuecomment-216586614\nYou will not get any flickering at all in any platform when you use anaconda, it is probably caused by any other package interfering with ST3 completion mechanism, please, disable any other Python auto-completer package while using anaconda.\n. Can I know which one was?\n. I can't replicate it, my configuration on this test is:\nOS: Linux\nST3: 3114\nAnaconda: Last\nPython Interpreter: 2.7.11\nDo you have any logs in the console or in your Jedi cache directory?\n\n. Are you using Linux? If you are on OS X it will be in ~/Library/Caches/Jedi\n. I still can't replicate it using Python 3.5.1 in my Linux box, I will try to replicate it later in my OS X box. By the way, are you using some specific character encoding in the header of the file that gives you the problem?\n. By the way, your system is reporting that the symbol that can not be decoded is \\u25b2 that is just \u25b2 character\n. I could totally reproduce it in OS  X 10.10.5 using Python 3.5.1 \n. Fixed, to be released\n. Hey @karolyi did I released this fix? I am totally unable to remember if I did it or not, I think I did but...\n. My OS X box is locked for undefined time probably the fix is in a local branch on it's hard drive :(. You can start anaconda in debug mode with: \npython -B ~/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p <your_project_name> DEBUG\nCan you giive it a try to see if the problem is still the same or if its a new one?\n. There should be some log in:\n~/Library/Logs/anaconda/<your_project_name>/\n. @karolyi  can you try the following in your OS X?\n- Open a terminal\n- write: python3 -c \"print(b'Espa\\xc3\\xb1a'.decode('utf8'))\"\n- write: PYTHONIOENCODING=\"utf8\" python3 -c \"print(b'Espa\\xc3\\xb1a'.decode('utf8'))\"\nPaste here your results\n. Do you think you can join our gitter for a second? https://gitter.im/DamnWidget/anaconda?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge\n. You can reinstall the package control version again @karolyi :)\n. Try to set the tab options as is shown in the screenshot below\n\n. The for completion is what in Sublime Text is known as a snippet those snippets comes with your Sublime Text 3 installation they are not part of anaconda themselves, said that, you could be able to fix any PEP8 violation using the anaconda's auto formatting capabilities.\nTo do so, just open your Command Palette and write autoformat and then press enter, anaconda will autoformat your whole file, you can also use a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+R on Linux and Windows for example) . You can also configure anaconda to run the autoformat every time that you save your file.\nI don't recommend run the autoformat with very long files as the ST3 performance can be compromised.\nFor more information take a look to the official documentation for autoformat, that is an extensive anaconda documentation where you can learn how to configure multitude of options and discover what the plugin can offer you.\n. No problem, there is a chat room in gitter where you can also ask for any help that you need, me or other people that are available could help you with your doubts.\nYou can join the chat room cliking on this link\n. That is what in computer science is known as code linting, you can check the wikipedia article for more information.\nThey are annoying for a reason, in that way you are \"forced\" to fix your code, anaconda is telling you that your code \"smells\" for whatever reason, the package support code analysis and style analysis. If you move your cursor to one of the lines, you will get a complete description of what the problem in that line is in the Sublime Text 3 status bar, I guess you are mixing spaces with tabs and this is why you have all of your lines marked.\nI recommend you to take a look to the plugin documentation about linting  and that you read the documentation in general.\nEven if anaconda allows you to completely disable code linting, I recommend you that don't do it and get used to fix your code to don't get marks, in no time you will be writing fully compliant code.\nBtw, in your generate_url function, you use string concatenation using the + symbol, that is considered a bad practice in Python as strings are non mutable data structures and every time that you concatenate them (like it was PHP) python is allocating new memory and creating a new string to append the right side of the expression, that is slow. You will probably want to take a look at the Wikipedia article about string interpolation where you can find examples for python and the official Python documentation about common string operations.\nRegards\n. Hi, the docker branch refactors how the workers spawns and connects to the JsonServer there is no much point in look at this now as all its current subsystem form is gonna be replaced soon.\nIf the problem grows and makes impossible to you to use ST3 re-open this issue so I Could give you further assistance.\n. Probably you are not using a python3 interpreter for your python_interpreter settings.\n. Hi, I will take a look on this as soon as I can. \n. I could not replicate the problem as it has been described in the issue, anyway, I found that sometimes Jedi fails to imports modules in some cases with specific relative imports. \nSadly I am not able to offer a satisfactory solution yet to this problem.\n. Interesting. Did you noticed if there was any exceptions being logged into your logs while you were recording the video?\n. I mean this logs @Effenberg0x0 https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda#anaconda-behaves-slowly-and-jsonserver-crashes\n. What happens if you disable the import validations and just autocomplete that module?\n. To add more information into this. if you start ST3 with validate_imports set as false the behaviour is 100% correct until you enable the validate_imports option that it fails and stays in that state until ST3 is restarted again.\nThis is a weird one.\n. I will check in OS X and Windows later in home\n. I can confirm that behaviour is consistently reproducible in both OS X and Windows 10\n. Hard to say Alvaro, I am still struggling myself to understand how the linting could affect in any way the auto completion as they are completely decoupled features, one should not affect the other. I have no idea how Jedi could stop giving us results after any linting option is used.\nIf I was you, I would start adding some logging verbosity into the jedi handler in the anaconda_server so you can see what the Jedi library is doing and how it behaves. For me is a big mystery how this could be happening, unfortunately I don't have many time now and I have lot of work to do.\nI hope you can find a solution, I will provide you all the guidance that I could.\n. Guys, this totally looks like a bug in jedi, you can confirm it following the steps below in an IPython or Python REPL and the files that @Effenberg0x0 provided (here) :\n```python\na = 'from my_package.my_module import MyModule'\nb = 'import logging'\nimport jedi\nprint(jedi.Script(a, 1, 37, '/bug_main.py').goto_assignments())\nprint(jedi.Script(b, 1, 10, '/my_package/my_module.py').goto_assignments())\nUntil here everything is fun and happy, but if you try to get the assignments for the a again:python\nprint(jedi.Script(a, 1, 37, '/bug_main.py').goto_assignments())\n```\nYou get an empty list. \nActually I \"fixed\" it in anaconda, and I double quote the word fixed because is just a workaround that uses the Jedi API wrong just not specifying a file path to the Script constructor, doing that must be avoided, I am gonna alert David about this in Jedi itself.\nThe \"fix\" will be released later today/. Could you kindly confirm that this issue has been resolved in 2.1.8?\nThank you.. I just merged your PR, how are we looking?. If @jt-wang is still around. can you please confirm and close?. Answering your first question, you can take a quick look at the open issues and pick one to start working on, if you do, diverge your code from v2.0.0-rc1 branch please.\nAbout the non python-support, well, anaconda offers a plugable architecture ready to use with any ST3 package, you can find more information in the plugable architecture section of the anaconda's developer documentation\nI am not native English speaker but I can't see why anaconda rust doesn't sound right ;)\nEDIT: By the way, you can take a look to anaconda_php and anaconda_rust code to get an idea of how to use anaconda infrastructure to complete/lint other languages\n. I already have a plans to decouple even more the anaconda JsonServer from ST3 itself, and make it a standalone service that could be then used with other editors like atom, brackets, vim or emacs what I don't have is time.\nThe only downside to move the anaconda asynchronous infrastructure (workers, jsonclient, ioloop) into a separate package is the added complexity, is something that I am open to study and review but right now I am focusing my limited time into release version 2.\nBtw, if you choose an issue to work on, let me know cos probably I am working on it as well or I can guide you a bit about it.\n. Sorry for the delay, I have been really busy lately. \nI think #414 is gonna be a bit tricky as the support for HTML in the ST3 tooltip thing is not too complete.\nAbout #235, I think ST3 already implements something like that in the vanilla packages in the Goto everywhere.\n. Hey @pradyunsg, any progress about the issues that you did choose?\n. No worries, there is no rush I was just checking old issues so I had to ask\n. @pradyunsg https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/projects\n. I will try to answer your doubts:\n- It is easy to distribute (just a binary) and it's seriously fast as an HTTP router plus it's easy to make concurrent/asynchronous work with it  and support contextual operations out of the box since Go 1.7. I am open to other languages with similar capabilities like Rust, the reason that I did not choose Rust is that I am not that proficient with  as I am with Go. I also like Twisted and PyPy but the redistribution of the server if it is written into Python depends too much in the end user environment something that we don't really want.\n- I don't really see any problem for some cities called the same than the application, at least there is no other software called the same (like the situation that we have now)\n- That's right\n. @pradyunsg can you send me an email? My email address is in my Github information.\nRegards.\n. nope, I did not get anything\n. That is more a question for Jedi, our auto-completion underlying library and seems like it's already answered https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/729\nI will update to the latest stable Jedi version for v2.0.0 that is on the way now but Jedi will move that feature to the stable branch in the future I am afraid.\n. Hard to say where the problem relies with that log, I am closing this for now, feel free to open it if you encounter the problem again.\n. I think your problem is that you have the debugging mode enabled and Anaconda is trying to run more than one JsonServer in port 9999.\nTake a look at your configuration files.\n. I don't think you will experience this problem if you disable the debug mode. Anaconda tries to start every instance of the JsonServer in it's own port, u will not get an Address already in use error in regular circumstances.\nWhen you set the debug mode, you are telling anaconda to stick with the configured port so it will always try to start a server in the specified port, normally that is not a problem because when you set the debug mode on you start the JsonServer manually in that port using the special flag DEBUG so you can get a lot of verbose output from the interpreter itself, output like inner libraries crashes and things that are not catched up from the regular logger.\nNow let's say that you didn't started the server manually, as anaconda can't connect to the JsonServer it starts a new one, if for any reason another window (or anaconda plugin like anaconda_rust or anaconda_php) try to start it's own instance of the server, you are gonna find yourself into problems as the port is already in use and anaconda is gonna get stuck in a loop trying to run a new JsonServer instance.\nThat has been improved in v2.0.0 and a smarter mechanism has replaced the current naive worker module.\n. You will see the problem if for some reason the JsonServer asynchat is crashing due an unhandled exception but the socket is not released (hard to recreate anyway)\n. From the config file:\n/* If the option below is set as true, anaconda will merge the outputs of display_signatures and show documentation\n\u00a0*note*: This has only effect if tooltips are enabled */ \n\"merge_signatures_and_doc\": true,\nTry to set that as false.\n. I will take a look\n. I already fixed this bug but I am not sure when I am gonna release it, I don't know if wait for v2.0.0 or push a small one. I will decide it later.\n. I made my mind, I will release this fix later today\n. Hi Jorge\nYou really shouldn't be using the Anaconda Python Builder, create one for your own and attach to it, anyway, I will think about add something like what you requested but the Anaconda Python Builder is not designed to be flexible but easy to use.\n. What you mean with Goto Next/Previous Method? To iterate over the methods of a class definition?\n. If you think you can implement it, go on, it could be added in v2.0.0. you can take a look at the developer documentation to make a general idea about how the package code is structured and how it works\n. Is the double choice present for every symbol or is for some specific libraries? The Goto, Autocomplete and Show Documentation features are provided by Jedi so I guess it is returning those dupes.\nCan you try to run jedi manually in an IPython (or similar) from the anaconda's anaconda_lib directory using a symbol that gave you the problem?\nFor example, and using the file test.py as sample:\npython\nimport jedi\nwith open('~/projects/my_project/test.py',  'r') as f:\n    jedi.Script(f.read()).completions()\nNote that the last character of the file must be in a letter of the symbol word that gave you dupes, you can also use a multiline string using ''' if you are more comfortable.\n. That is life ;)\n. I am not sure if I want to add that overhead to every single request, look for dupes means add in a way or another an O(n^2) operation that is kinda slow to solve a problem that I consider to be minor.\n. I was taking a look at the code and at your solution, I used the os.path as sample and I don't think your solution is valid as in the multiple import scenario the line and column are different, you can check it running the following:\n``` python\nimport jedi\ndata = [(i.module_path, i.line, i.column + 1) for i in jedi.Script('import os; os.path').goto_assignments() if not i.in_builtin_module()]\nprint(data)\n[('/usr/lib/python3.5/os.py', 57, 25),\n('/usr/lib/python3.5/os.py', 77, 22),\n('/usr/lib/python3.5/os.py', 98, 22)]\n```\nIs not that simple to fix that at our level.\n. @asfaltboy can you please give a try to branch issue_497 ?\n. I had to look in Google what LGTM means xDDDD (I am getting old), I will do a small release with the fix as soon as I fix the tests for Python 2.6 that are currently failing because the change :(\n. Hi, thank you for test anaconda v2.0.0 as being the next major release I\nam beinng very cautious about it.\nYou can check the options for MyPy in here:\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/v2.0.0-rc1/Anaconda.sublime-settings#L451-L495\nFor docker you can follow the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Anaconda-v2:-Using-a-remote-python-interpreter-through-Docker\nRegards\nOn Sat, Jul 30, 2016 at 02:27:08AM -0700, sametmax wrote:\n\n2 stuff I tried to do but couldn't find how:\n- Activate mypy linting;\n- test the docker integration.\nThe rest seems to work fine for now, but I'll need a week of fiddling to confirm it's solid.\n\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/498#issuecomment-236355499\n.

Any update here?\n. Those are quite a few plugins that you are using.\nFirst thing, don't use SublimeCodeIntel and anaconda together, if you are gonna edit python code, consider to disable SublimeCodeIntel, this is a plugin well known for interfere with other autocompletion plugins, anaconda being one of them.\nI still need the logs that I asked for. Can you provide them please?\n. I am gonna close this as right now is just noise, feel free to re-open if you find a reliable way to reproduce the problem. What you mean with \"output pr\"? You can use # noqa to suppress some of the linting errors\n. Is not that simple to suppress them at the plugin level, the data that comes from the linters have no information about the comments in the line that has being linted. I would need to think about this deeper to know if it would be viable.\nIn the meanwhile you have several options\n- Add the errors/warnings that annoys you to the ignore list (but it would be disable in the whole project ;___;)\n- Disable linting in that file :|\n. I think I can implement this but it has to wait till v2.0.0\n. This was release a while ago, can you @AllanLRH  confirm that is working as expected and close the ticket please?. Seems like they modified the error codes descriptions since that page that you referenced was written, they have a much more accurate descriptions now, I should update ours.\nMore info: http://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes\n. I updated the documentation to reflect a more accurate description of what each error means instead of what the autoformat tool do\n. There is nothing that we can do with the information that you provided that is none. You should tell us which versions are you using in which operating system and which other packages are you using along side with anaconda.\nThe first thing that you should do is disable all plugins but anaconda and check if your ST3 is unresponsive, if it is, you probably configured a non valid python_interpreter or you didn't configured a python_interpreter and there is no python command in your PATH.\nPlease, refer to the documentation: http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/\n. Can't reproduce it using Python 3.5.2, what is that vagrant machine running?\n. In the traceback looks like your Python 3 interpreter is using the Enum backport for Python 2 instead of it's own native Enum class.\nI don't think this is related with anaconda itself but environmental to your vagrant.\nBy the way, if you are using anaconda with vagrant, you would probably give a try to the v2.0.0-rc1 branch using this configuration: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Anaconda-v2:-Using-a-remote-python-interpreter-through-Vagrant\n. I see that we have a nice use case in here, try this:\n- Clone anaconda v2.0.0-rc1 in the vagrant guest (linux)\n- Remove your current anaconda version from ST3 (1.4.28)\n- Clone anaconda v2.0.0-rc1 in your ST3 Packages directory\n- Configure your vagrant to expose the port that you are gonna run anaconda to the internet (you can check how to do that in this link)\n- Start the anaconda's minserver.py in the Linux guest using: python minserver.py -p <your_project_name> -e <any_extra_path_that_you_need> <port>\n- Set this as your python_interpreter in your ST3: \"python_interpreter\": \"tcp://OS_X_HEADLESS_IP:ANACONDA_MINSERVER_PORT\"\nIt will work.\nP.D: You can also use a regular guest:host port forwarding and connect trough an SSH tunnel from your laptop to the OS X server\n. @divinites I am wondering if you tried with the last v2.0.4, let me know if it's finally working for you\n. For some reason the minserver.py version that got into the release is old...\nPlease, change the line 28  of anaconda_server/minserver.py to\npython\nfrom lib.path import log_directory\nI will fix it in next release\n. This issue has been fixed already in last version\n. Can't replicate it using Python 3.5.2, try this:\n- Open a Terminal\n- Go to the Anaconda directory under your ST3 packages folder \n- cd into anaconda_lib\n- run this command python -c \"import jedi; s = jedi.Script('import sys; sys.stdout.f', path='.'); print(s.completions())\"\nIf you get an output like: [<Completion: fileno>, <Completion: flush>] everything is fine with your installation, if you still don't get the completion to work in ST3, copy and paste the anaconda server logs for your on use project into a gist and link it.\n. There is another user that uses the anaconda Python distribution that have the same problem with the enum. I will try to install it and reproduce the problem\n. Hi @Effenberg0x0 \nThis PR must wait until I release 2.0.0 (hopefully this week), I will check it then.\n. Hi, until all the bug reports related with 2.0.0 are fixed/resolved this PR is gonna have to wait, I hope you don't mind.\n. No idea, probably you ran ST3 as root in some moment and the file was written by root? In any case the jsonserver runs as the user that runs the ST3's plugin_host that runs as the user that runs sublime_text binary, so in some moment that user was root.\n. I will probably add something regarding that to the README.md after release v2.0.0 later this afternoon\n. What you mean about not finding anything for anaconda in ~/Library/Logs? That directory doesn't exists?\n. @alexfradiani consider to install version 1.4.28 while I investigate about this. You can do it uninstalling anaconda (if you didn't uninstalled it yet) and then running the following in your terminal (after close your ST3 running instance if any):\n- cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages\n- git clone https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda.git\n- git checkout v1.4.28\nThat will install anaconda v1.4.28 for you. I have no access to my OS X box right now and that is why I am suggesting you to do a downgrade, you should have a ~/Library/Logs/anaconda directory in your user home, the fact that you don't have it could mean that there is a serious major bug in OS X that I could not be able to check in a while :|\n. @kichooo can you provide us with logs?\n. @alexfradiani I am able to run anaconda in OS X I need you to start the anaconda's JsonServer manually in debug mode ans try again. To do so:\n- Stop ST3\n- Just checkout the master branch in the anaconda git repo\n- execute: <your_python_interpreter> -B ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonsever.py -p anaconda DEBUG\n- Start ST3\nIf you don't get any exception after run that command you will have a log file in ~/Library/Logs/anaconda/anaconda/anaconda_jsonserver.log you can get debug output from both the log file and the standard output.\n. @kichooo create a pastebin (or a gist) with the contents of:\n~/.local/share/anaconda/logs/<your_project_name>/anaconda_jsonserver.log\n. @kichooo try this:\n- close ST3\n- In a terminal write: python -B ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p anaconda DEBUG\n- open ST3 and edit a Python file\n- take a look at the directory that I told you before, you will have some output as well in the standard output of the terminal that you ran the command \nIf anaconda works in that scenario, your python_interpreter is probably wrong or is not in your PATH\n. No problem, glad to hear that is solved.\n. Can we close this?\n. I am not expert on Windows (just use it to play games that doesn't work on Linux) so I don't really know what is that Windows Python Launcher but looks like whatever python command that tool is invoking is not found in your path for the environment that the ST3 is inheriting.\nTry to change the python_interpreter to the full path of your real python interpreter.\n. Anaconda will update the Anaconda Python Builder to use whatever Python interpreter that you configured as your python_interpreter setting option. If it is missing is because anaconda is not able to start the jsonserver using that configured Python interpreter or because you are not using any ST3 project file.\n. @ZupoLlask any update?\n. But is anaconda working at all for you?\n. Are you working into a Sublime Text 3 Project?, Anaconda creates the Anaconda Python Builder entry only if you are working in a project (as it creates the entry at your project level)\n. Can you gist and share the contents of ~/.local/shared/anaconda/tbh/logs/anaconda_jsonserver.log please?\n. Seems like the jsonserver is crashing but for some reason we don't have any exception in the logs. I am gonna need you to start the server manually and paste any exception that is thrown to the standard output. To do so:\n- Disable Anaconda plugin using Command Palette\n- Close ST3 and make sure there is no jsonserver's running using ps \n- Open ST3 and get it's PID using ps\n- In a terminal, python -B /home/proj/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p tbh -e /home/proj/proj <STR_PID> where STR_PID is the pid that you got in the previous step\n- Enable Anaconda plugin using Command Palette\n- Edit some Python file a bit and look at the terminal\n. I understand that the \"perhaps\" paragraph is in answer to the \"no logs in the log file\", nope, that is just for verbosity, I will take a look at the exceptions chain when I have time.\nSeems like you have an unicode problem (my favourite). Can I know the context of your project? \n- The path containing your files use any non ASCII character?\n- The code contains any non ASCII character?\n. @nattster any update in your side?\n. I will make a release later today to hopefully fix this issue.\n. Please, update your installation with v2.0.3, feel free to re-open if the issue persist (but add new logs)\n. Anaconda works fine after that? If so, don't worry too much, your OS X is just a bit slow \n. Is weird that you Operating Systems can't connect to your localhost in less than 0.05s (is much more weirder for @alejoar as for him anaconda is using an Unix Socket Domain).\nCan I know your hardware specs please?\n. Give a try to v2.0.3 and close if it resolved you issue.\n. Maybe slow disks or too much IO in your device, anyway, is not normal that your OS is unable to open a connection to the loopback interface in less than 0.1 seconds\n. Glad to read @alejoar \n. I will redesign how the plugin fires it's jsonserver worker and how it connects to it so you don't get annoyed with the popup when you start ST3 or open a new window containing Python files.\nSaid that, take into account that is quite weird that you get this warning due slowness in your system, I did test this hundred of times during development in Windows, OS X and Linux and I never got this warning popup just because my system was not fast enough as to stablish a connection with the local worker in less than 0.05s.\nFor now, just wait until I release a new version with a new approach, seems like v2.1 is coming faster than I expected :(\n. That could be a reason @espositofulvio I never had these kind of warning but all my boxes use SSD. Probably a firewall issue @JPCoding ?. What did you test? If the problem is not a firewall then probably there is no JsonServer started for anaconda to connect to, check if there are any python processes running in the system using tasklist in a CMD.exe or PowerShell. Take a look at %APPDATA\\Anaconda\\Logs\nNote that majority of people that gets this warning, have no problems at all after close the popup message, so make sure that anaconda is not working for you after close that message (because probably it is working) and if it works, just ignore the message.. What is your python_interpreter configuration?. Can you run the following in the ST3 console please? (line per line or it will not work)\npython\nimport subprocess\nprint(subprocess.getoutput('python -c \"import sys; print(sys.version_info);\"'))\nThanks.. Sorry, which version of ST3 are you using?. Looks like the embedded Python interpreter in your ST3 is screwed up... Can you please remove ST3 completely from your machine and reinstall it?. If when you try to use subprocess.getoutput in your ST3 console you get the error you pasted here that means ST3 python interpreter is not working as intended, sadly I can not offer you support for Sublime Text 3 itself beyond what I already did.\nAnaconda uses the subprocess module from your ST3 python embedded interpreter, you have to understand that I can not possibly fix a problem in your ST3 or fix a problem in ST3 directly in anaconda.\nTry to run the commands that I pasted earlier again, if you continue getting that kind of error about getoutput not being defined, consider to open a ticket or start a new thread in the official Sublime Text forum.. Sorry for the delay @JPCoding but is actually hard to follow up a closed ticket, can we continue this on Gitter or Email?. Oh, I see, glad to hear :). That is a well known issue with ST3 autocompletion mechanism, use this workaround to solve it (is in the README.md)\n. Any update here @gbritton1 ?\n. Use Ctrl+B?\n. Well, we don't really know as the provided information is not enough to know if anaconda is working for the user but I guess that I would let you guys talk on this issue.\n. It maybe is an issue with anaconda, I just redesigned how the python_interpreter option is handled, let me take a look, I will re-open it again if finally is a problem with anaconda.\n. Guys, $VIRTUAL_ENV is an environment variable, if you are using ST3 from POSIX operating systems (Linux or macOS) you have to start ST3 from the command like to import those variables from your SHELL. You get those boxes cos your code has linting errors, why don't you try\njust to fix what the status bar tells you about the line when you have\nselected it?\nIf you still want to disable it just set the option \"anaconda_linting\" as\nfalse in the anaconda configuration file but that will not change the\nfact that the code is erroneous or not PEP8 compliant, it just ignored the\nfact...\nOn Aug 29, 2016 11:59 PM, \"gbritton1\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n[image: 2016-08-29_18-57-07]\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12263288/18070239/92738806-6e1a-11e6-8fed-5f3540f4871a.png\nHow can I stop Sublime from boxing every line like this?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/518, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAUIJtV9MJkVsZcG_lfgpcgXJYeiHVAnks5qk2Q2gaJpZM4Jv-6d\n.\n.

Forum, huh?\n\nAnaconda from Continuum is a Python distribution including a Python Interpreter and lot of ready to use Python packages for scientific usage mainly.\nOur Anaconda is a package that converts Sublime Text 3 into a full featured Python IDE\n. Can you gist the contents of anaconda's jsonserver logs and paste the URL to that gist?\nThe logs could be found in:\n- Linux: ~/.local/share/anaconda/logs//anaconda_jsonserver.log\n- OS X: ~/Library/Logs/anaconda//anaconda_jsonserver.log\n. I could not replicate the issue myself, I have mypy-lang-0.4.4 installed globally on my system (used pip to install it as there are no Arch packages) and it was working just fine into anaconda project itself (that is the only Python project that I currently work on).\nThen I did open a new ST3 window and created a new python file, I noticed that MyPy wasn't working on that file but really everything was a bit slow so I did check the logs and noticed that the josnserver was crashing every time that MyPy was trying to lint the file. As soon as I drag and drop the file into anaconda project ST3 window it start working fine, I don't use any virtualenv or fancy python interpreter for anaconda project just the system one so in both scenarios the python interpreter was the same one.\nObviously there is some kind of problem but is kind of weird, I will investigate further and come up with a solution.\n. This is resolved and waiting release\n. This has been released already\n. Trust me, if your configured Python interpreter is able to see the mypy\nmodule it has to work.

You are not using latest version, update to v2.0.6 and try again (paste the output if you get the same error)\n. Duplicate of #514 \n. First of all, did you try to do what the error says?\nSecond, is anaconda working normally after show that error?\nThird, which version of anaconda are you actually using?\nOperating System? Sublime Build? Logs?\n\nIs really hard to help someone that doesn't provide any kind of information, don't you think so?\n. Duplicate of #514\nThis happens because your systems, for whatever reason, are not able to connect to localhost during 2 seconds for N tries with 0.2s timeout each, that is abnormal, your systems would be able to connect to the loopback interface/unix socket domain in less than 0.2s always. In fact I have never been able to replicate this issue even using a timeout of 0.001s.\nAbout the error that @traversw pasted, it is because there is already a JsonServer running and ST3 being unable to connect is asking to start it again (that is weird as well).\n@RafaAguilar the socket name should not have any equal symbol on it, can you double check it?\n. Interesting... I am not sure what the build system has to do with anaconda JsonServer startup but I will make some deeper investigation as this piece of information from @Tomvass  looks like can lead us to find some kind of weird hidden bug into the new anaconda's startup logic.\n. I did some deeper investigation into this and there is no link between the build system and some people systems being slow enough to connect their localhost as to raise this error.\nI just added a new configuration setting that anyone could use to disable the startup warnings (they still get logged into the ST3 console).\n``` javascript\n/*\n    Set this option to true if you get warnings about anaconda not\n    being able to connect to your localhost on ST3 startup but it\n    works normally after closing the error message.\nNOTE: Ignore errors is dangerous do it under your own responsibility\n\n*/\n\"swallow_startup_errors\": false\n```\nAs the note in the comment says, use it at your own discretion. It will be part of the package in version 2.0.8\n. Is there any anaconda Python JsonServer in the system? (ps aux | grep jsonserver). Try to stop ST3 and kill any stuck anaconda's JsonServer then start ST3 again.\nLooks like the Unix Domain Sockets are giving us some logistical problems, probably we will get rid of them in next releases.\n. I would never recommend to modify PyFlakes library if you don't know the implications of what you are doing, btw, I don't see the relation between that and the system being too slow as to start a JsonServer and connect to it.\nCan you try to explain it please?\nP.S: btw, that change totally breaks PyFlakes support in Python 2 so please, don't use it\n. That looks like Windows TCP/IP port exhaustion. Do you know how many instances of anacondas's JsonServer were in the system? Btw, which windows version?\n. It's like your Windows ran out of socket descriptors, in the logs we can see that anaconda is operating normal just linting your code after a lint request so the connection is already established but there is another JsonServer starting up for the same project/folder name.\nAre you sure you didn't had two different Sublime Text 3 windows opening the same project/folder? \nTo check in windows about the JsonSever just open the tasks manager and look for python processes. \n. That's weird @jaydenkieran and @ayushjaiswal as you can see in the code if swallow_startup_errors is true that line of code that contains the sublime_message trigger will not be executed.\n. Try with 2.1.1 please\n. @ibnbay99 which error?\n. You should have some logs in ~/Library/Logs/anaconda probably there is something making the jsonserver to crash if there is nothing there I will give you instructions to start it in DEBUG manual mode so we can find what the problem is\n. Ok, so let's start it manually in DEBUG mode to see what is going on. Open a terminal and write:\npython -B ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p <your_project_or_directory> DEBUG\nChange the <your_project_or_directory> to the name of your project or the name of the directory that contains your code, then start your Sublime Text 3 and open the directory where your code is.\n. Is the user running python owner (or have the right permissions) of the /Users/whatever/Library/Application Support/Anaconda directory? @crc32 \n. @lovette the value of the param -p must be just the last part of the path webapp-www in this case instead of the full path. Change it and try again, when the server starts open your ST3 to see if the client can connect to the server.\n. Can you check if for any chance you have the jsonserver_debug option set as true? If you do, set it as false because anaconda is never gonna try to start a JsonServer automatically if that is set as true. To make sure you did not override the default configuration that should be false you can open the Sublime Text 3 while your buffer is in any Python file and write:\npython\nfrom anaconda.anconda_lib.helpers import get_settings\nprint(get_settings(view, 'jsonserver_debug')\nYour problem 100% looks like you have your anaconda set up for development (development of anaconda itself I mean).\n. The import error is because you installed anaconda trough Package Control it renames it automatically to Anaconda so the import should be something like:\npython\nfrom Anaconda.anaconda_lib.helpers import get_settings\nAnyway, now is just a matter of see if there are any errors both in the ST3 console and in the JsonServer logs (you must now have something in ~/Library/Logs/anaconda/<your_project_name> so just work for ten minutes and take a look at those places.  Paste whatever you find in some gists as well as your project configuration (if any) and anaconda configuration.\n. Ok, now you can close your ST3 and start it from the command line with:\npython2.6 -B ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p webapp-www -e ~/Projects/webapp/project/sites/www,~/Projects/webapp/project/shared-packages,~/Projects/webapp/virtualenvs/webapp-www/lib/python2.6/site-packages,~/Projects/webapp/project/schema/projectdb,~/Projects/webapp/project/sites/default,~/Projects/webapp/project/sites/shared,~/Projects/webapp/project/temp DEBUG\nSince anaconda 2.0 is not necessary to set the jsonserver_debug flag as true so you can just left if commented, anaconda will connect to the already running server as soon as you start ST3 and start typing in the project.\nYou will get an extremely verbose output with any exceptions from the asyncchat frames.\nP.S: note that Python2.6 support is dropped form the Python Software Foundation, we still pass all the tests for Python2.6 in the travis and tox test suites but is quite possible that some of the tools that anaconda uses internally does not, so use Python2.6 at your own risk.\n. Well, of course it does, it would be really frustrating for me to try to give support to someone that is not able to connect to the JsonServer with nothing that guide us about that being the problem, anaconda will always log in the ST3 console despite whatever configuration the user have for GUI error notifications.\nIf anaconda works well after you get this error and the error is no in the console repeated in an infinite loop, you are fine, just ignore it.\n. I would be much more happier if we were able to resolve your problem but is\nreally hard try to figure out what can be wrong being unable to replicate\nit myself.\nOn 17 October 2016 at 20:49, Lance Lovette notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nTo add closure to my issue, Anaconda starts working as expected after I\nedit my sublime-project files and change python_interpreter to python2.7.\nAssuming python_interpreter only influences Anaconda, I'm happy to keep\nit this way...\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/527#issuecomment-254313537,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAUIJj_RMv8XwVKivk9Qnro1LGoUkgHdks5q09FYgaJpZM4JzncS\n.\n\n\nJoin the Free Software Foundation and become Free as in Freedom\n.

We pass tests for Python2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, Pypy and Pypy3 so you shouldn't need to use an specific version of Python to run the JsonServer.\nThe JsonServer is started using your configured python_interpreter. Hi,\nanaconda_lib/typing.py should not be imported in Python2 I will take a look over the weekend. Looks like sphinx/jinja2glue.py imports the typing module but that module exists just in Python3  or in a backaport of MyPy  for Python2, the most strange thing is that in your case sphinx/jinja2glue.py is in your /usr/local/lib/python2.7 path so I am not sure why it is trying to import Python3 modules.\nA side effect is that the vendored typing module from anaconda is being used instead of the system one as anaconda injects it's vendored libraries up in the importing path but you would get the same error trying to import typing from the system.\nYou can just check that trying to import typing in a Python2 terminal session.. Well you can't... I have to fix it in anaconda and make a new release\nOn Jun 22, 2017 14:16, \"Cody Han\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI see what you mean.

I forgot about this issue because it doesn't have it's own issue and is not related with the OP issue, I am a very busy person and some times, this just happens (me forgetting things that aren't easy to track) I will fix it and provide a new release today.\n\nRegards.. @codyhan94, @markkco and @bjarchi the typing issue should had been fixed in https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/releases/tag/v2.1.20 please take a look. Is there any jsonserver running in your system? Anything in the logs directory?. Because you enabled it.... Looks good. Pending release. Just a thing that is not clear for me (commented in the code)\n. If it reports syntax errors is because there are syntax errors, make sure you are not mixing spaces and tabs, go line by line and read the description of the error in the status bar.\n. Well, that is what we know as a PEP8 syntax violation warning, PEP8 warnings are not syntactical errors but warnings about you not following the Python conventions for writing code that the whole community put effort into.\nPEP8 is important because it makes possible for any Python programmer in the world (that follows and knows about the PEP8) to quickly understand and get familiar with anyone else Python code (always that both of them are following the PEP8).\nIf you really want to suppress PEP8 linting you can do it just setting pep8 as false in the configuration file but i really discourage such action, is much better for you to get used to the Python community conventions and follow them, if you do, you will grow as programmer, the other way around is not true.\nBy the way, you may want to tune your Theme settings to make anaconda lint in different colors by severity the lines that contains any kind of problem. If you do, syntax errors will be linted as red while warnings and small violations will be linted in yellow and white respectively.\nIf you want to customize your theme just follow the instructions from the wiki.\nEDIT: About what you call 'intellisense' (I guess you are used to some kind of monster IDE) in ST3 is called autocompletion and anaconda will be able to autocomplete everything that your configured Python interpreter is able to see. So if for example, you're installing some Python package for python3 and python3 is not your default system interpreter, you have to configure your Python3 interpreter as python_interpreter in the anaconda project or user options.\nI recommend you to read the documentation about anaconda configuration and options.\n. Don't need to apologise, pandas and numpy are known to have some problems with Jedi the underlying library that we use to get autocompletion probably is related to that.\n. Make sure that you are not using SublimeJedi and Anaconda at the same time.\nIf you're not using them at the same time, paste the anaconda jsonserver logs into a gist and share it please.\n. Any update here?\n. You can find the path in this section of the README \n. I see nothing weird in the logs, did you try to remove the ST3 cache?\n. I think so but take a look at ~/Library/Application\\ Support as well\n. Anaconda should not try to  fire auto completion at all when you type the colon symbol (if you didn't configured your ST3 to fire auto completion on colon for Python code). Are you sure that you don't have any other completion plugin active that is interfering with anaconda? A typical suspect is SublimeCodeIntel that is known for interfere with other completion plugins.\nThe problem that you show me in the video should never happen in a typical use, anyway, even if you get errors about the signatures you should not feel any \"slowness\" on the completion due the fact that show signatures and completions are two independent and isolated anaconda asynchronous calls that should not interfere with your typing or with the speed of your ST3.\nPlease, disable any other plugin in your ST3 and try again, make sure that you are not trying to fire the completion when you type the colon in Python code. As a rule of thumb is always a good idea to disable any other plugin and try to reproduce the problem.\nP.S: Restart your ST3 instance after disable plugins and delete the cache as well\n. Well, I don't know what is it but something is firing ST3 auto-completion and it is not anaconda, anaconda doesn't ever fires autocompletion by itself, it rather hooks itself into regular ST3 autocompletion event that is normally triggered by ST3 itself.\n. Do you have any errors at all in your ST3 console? That is a ST3 regular completion popup it does not appears to be enrich with anaconda auto completion.\n. Can you run \"Show linter errors\"? It looks like another plugin is eating the error description from the status bar.\n. I could replicate this, seems like there is line truncation in other PEP8 messages as well. Btw yeah, I meant that anaconda command, is hard to remember everything in a huge project like this one.\n. Discover what was going on with this one has been a pain. The culprit was autopep8 that we use to automatically format the buffer.\nSeems like autopep8 overrides some pep8 check functions by it's own, there was a disconformity in how our version of autopep8 decided to report back errors to pep8. I just upgraded both pep8 and autopep8 libraries to match their formats.\nPending for release.\n. Did you configured a Python >= 3.5 interpreter to work with?\n\n. I see, don't hesitate to open it again if you find what could be causing the anomaly.\n. I did look really fast at this issue and could replicate it, so weird. I will look into it in deeper detail as soon as I have some free time.\n. Well, I already resolved it, It will be inlcuded in v2.0.9\n. Jedi (the underlying completion library) is not able to parse the source if there is one or more leading whitespaces at the beginning of the file and the first node in the AST is a comment.\n. Looks like the vagrant app is not in your PATH, try to start ST3 from the command line using subl command.\n. I don't exactly know how did you got to that conclusion but you are wrong.\n\nAs you can see in that screenshot (the code is being linted by anaconda 2.0.8) I am using the last ST3 nightly build without any kind of problem.\nDisable all packages but anaconda and try again, if you still have any problem, please, gist the contents of the anaconda's JsonServer logs (you can follow this to find them) and provide useful information like your operating system, anaconda version and configuration.\n. probably the problem was in ST3 and not in anaconda :)\n. I think I know what the problem is, you have two options to solve it until I fix this and release the fix (it will wait a while as I am currently working in the Golang plugin for anaconda).\nOne of the ways is tedious and requires you to hack into anaconda's in memory data structures so let's go with the manual method better.\n- Start your VM manually before to start editing your Python files for your project\n- Start anaconda in the guest machine with: python -B /home/vagrant/.anaconda/anaconda_server/minserver.py -p my_project -e /var/my_project 19360\n- Modify your python_interpreter to: tcp://192.168.5.10:19360\nThat will work, I will let you know when this issue is fixed, let me know if you could make it work in the way explained above.\n. @trojkat \nStart the minserver with \n/src/my_env/bin/python -B /anaconda/anaconda_server/minserver.py -p my_project -e /src/my_project 19360\n. Well, that is not a PEP8 error so I don't see how the auto pep8 formatter would be responsible of fix such thing, anyway you can make a small plug-in in your own to solve that problem, follow this steps (I didn't test it myself but it will work just fine)\nCreate Small Python File\nIn ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime \\Text\\ 3/Packages/User create a file called nbsp.py with the following contents\n``` python\nimport sublime_plugin\nclass ReplaceNbsp(sublime_plugin.TextCommand):\n    def run(self, edit):\n        for nbsp in self.view.find_all('\\u00A0'):\n            self.view.replace(edit, nbsp, ' ')\nclass ReplaceNbspOnSave(sublime_plugin.EventListener):\n    def on_pre_save(self, view):\n        view.run_command('replace_nbsp')\n```\nRestart your ST3.\nThat will hook a new save event that will find and replace any 0xa0 unicode character into a regular ascii blank space.\nIf it doesn't work just create a new directory in your Packages directory with whatever name that you want and move the nbsp.py file into it.\n. Did it work @AndreasBackx ?\n. Hi\nIt looks that prospector is doing pretty much the same that anaconda already do trough it common linters, said that, I have no problems in add this as alternative linter as far as you continue supporting it and taking care of it, that means, integrate new versions, fix any issue, solve problems and give support here in the issues to users that could use it.\nApart from that any new tool needs unit tests and probably we will need to discuss about it in the mailing list or/and in gitter as there are some integrations that should be done to introduce this tool (for example, currently, Pylint is an alternative linter in anaconda as we use PyFlakes by default, so if the user configures anaconda to use Pylint, PyFlakes gets automatically deactivated no matter other configurations and PEP8 gets merged into Pylint results, something like that but more complex should be done in this case).\n. As I already explained in the PR, that is an external library so this should be addressed there\n. Nice, I will update it as soon as possible.. PyCodetyle was updated in v2.1.8 btw. Sorry for the delay, I've been really busy with anaconda_go lately.\nI really appreciate your contribution but you should really doing this PR into the PyCodeStyle Project itself, if we apply this in our own we must remember to apply that patch every time that we update PyCodeStyle library\nTake a look at their project github site\n. It's a submodule because it is vendored, anaconda needs specific versions of it's tools, vendoring solves that and a part from that we use the same version of the tools independently of which Python interpreter the user had configured.\n. I can't replicate this for variables\n\nOr for methods\n\n. Well, Jedi, the library that we use to offer auto completion has no way to infer the context from the location of the cursor in the file when the auto-completion event is fired by Sublime Text 3 (in your screenshot). Jedi always needs a string to perform the search trough the Python abstract syntax tree.\nI will think in a way to try to infer that context from anaconda itself and then pass a modified buffer to Jedi so we can trick it to think we are completing an specific context but it is in the bottom of the already very large TODO pile.\n. Related to #285 . Stop ST3, open a terminal and start anaconda server in DEBUG mode with:\n/home/bbt/.virtualenvs/<your_virtual_env>/bin/python -B /home/bbt/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p got-djent -e /home/bbt/coding/got-djent-v3,/home/bbt DEBUG\nThen start your ST3 open your got-djent project if is not still open and work normally, if it happens again, you will have a lot of debugging logs in the terminal, create a gist with them and paste it here.\nIt would be also useful if you paste the output of the command ps aux | grep jsonserver next time.\n. Any update here?\n. Let's close it for now I have more than enough work to do already ;)\n. As it says in the official documentation about disabling pep8 linter\n. If you move the cursor to the offending line you get a full description about the problem in the status bar\n. Well, ipython is not a Python interpreter but an Interactive Python Shell or a REPL so is not possible at all to support it as a python interpreter\n. There is no such function, the python_interpreter is just a configuration field, anything can be written off in there, by default it is python if it is not set and supposing that the user have a python binary in her $PATH it will provide always a valid python interpreter.\nThe idea behind the python_interpreter to be configurable is to be able to set other interpreters different than the system one, so for example anyone can use Jython or IronPython, or PyPy but it's main usage is to set interpreters of virtual environments to use the packages installed on those virtual environments.\nA part from that, the python_interpreter can be set to whatever implements Python or any kind of wrappers that wraps or hide the Python interpreter in any way.\nThat means that any user could be using whatever obscure wrapper written in let's say BASH or whatever with whatever kind of arbitrary name that could be a perfectly valid Python interpreter so there is no way that anaconda could be able to check if an arbitrary value written in there \"looks like a valid Python interpreter or not\". We just try to start the jsonserver script and if it fails for any reason we report it back I think that is just enough in any case.\n. I am closing this, feel free to open it again in the future if you have new doubts/comments/ideas\n. Disable/Uninstall SublimeJedi and/or Disable SublimeCodeIntel for Python while using anaconda\n.

I will take a look on it but that feature was contributed by an user and I am not very familiar with it myself as I always use a terminal window to run tests, compile and such.\n. I take a quick look on this and I am not able to replicate the issue @v-hunt in my case the options to run tests are always available as soon as my cursor is over valid python code (that is not a comment or a string) so I am marking this as not replicable.\nIf you find a deterministic way to replicate the problem please, share it\n. As @pradyunsg already said, that os not an easy task as the Sublime Text 3 API graphical capabilities are limited (very limited in fact).\n. If you feel brave enough (and you copromise with it's maintenance)  I will accept PRs to implement that feature, I could even give you a hand with anaconda's specifics but there is too much already in my plate as to think to implement something like that.\n. What do you mean @divinites? I am afraid that I don't understand your question.\n. I am not planing to integrate anything like that for now but if you have any idea about how to implement it feel free to work on it :)\nGolconda is able to execute anything that you pass as the Golconda's plugin entry point (like docker) so you can do it in whatever language that you wish, anyway, I am still designing/writing it with a reference plugin implementation (what is now anaconda_go) so probably you want to wait until that is done and released.\n. @v-hunt  https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/projects\n. It's early to define anaconda as legacy, there are lots of things that need to be done to consider anaconda as legacy but big features like this request will be taken into consideration in the future. You have to take into account that we highly depend on Package Control that lately is kind of slow reviewing and merging the PRs so the transition from anaconda to golconda is not gonna be fast.\n. I took a look to rpdb2 in my lunch time yesterday and it seems to get stacked if the Python interpreter gets stacked  so if for example your Python interpreter gets blocked in a system call to the OS rpdb2 is pretty much useless.\nAnyway, this is something that I always wanted to do but I was never in the mood, I even opened myself the oldest non resolved issue in this tracker the issue #54 that is still sitting there at the bottom of the list, @eivind88 was looking into some kind of variable inspector back in 2015 but I guess he ran out of free time or motivation.\nThis project is huge, I work not only on anaconda but in anaconda_php, anaconda_go and anaconda_rust each of then with their roadmaps and bugs, I am trying to decouple the anaconda's JsonServer and create a platform to make possible to integrate what today is known as the anaconda's JsonServer into any text editor with minimal effort. As you guys can understand I am the almost unique developer I can't do everything by myself but this is a thing that I really would like to integrate into the plugin some day.\n. I was regular contributor in SublimeRope, when the project was moved to SublimePythonIDE I helped with the transition and added linting support for it but at the end I started anaconda because difference of opinions about the course of SublimeRope/SublimePythonIDE.\nRope is a great tool it has many good features, one that I really miss a lot is it's ability to detect symbols in the buffer that were defined in a module in the PYTHONPATH but was not imported in the buffer, that was so cool to implement auto import tools, I implemented it in SublimeRope. \nSaid that, rope is an extremely slow library that requires lots of caches and specific configurations that made it less flexible than Jedi. A part from that, Rope is a refactoring solution, not an auto-completion, fast code analysis one. I am not sure if things changed in the last years but one big difference between rope and jedi is that rope compiles/executes your code while jedi uses static analysis.\nI am not aware of any good tool for refactoring in ST3 as I always refactor manually and actually the only Python projects that I work on are anaconda ones themselves.\nAdd rope to anaconda will be kind of trivial after the next big refactor that is happening in the next/intermediate future of the package.\n. Not right now, but something that could be added any time in the future if more people thinks it will be useful.\n. You are trying to run analysis tools in files that doesn't exists in the machine where ST3 and anaconda JsonServer are being executed only a disaster can be expected.\nIf you want to edit files in a SSHFS file system you will probably want to setup a remote python interpreter in the remote machine and map the directory names (if they are different). Take a look at the wiki documentation where a detailed explanation about how to do that is waiting for you to read.\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Anaconda-v2:-Using-a-remote-python-interpreter\nIf you need to map directory names take a look at this section of the remote vagrant documentation, it also applies to the remote python interpreter.\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/wiki/Anaconda-v2:-Using-a-remote-python-interpreter-through-Vagrant#mapping-directories\n. Even if the files being edited are in accesible trough the local VFS the libraries that they import are not, or probably they exists in other paths, that is why you can run into problems, by settings a remote Python Interpreter you make sure that the analysis occurs in the remote system where libraries and files are really accessible to the analysis tools.\nFeel free to re-open or comment (even if its closed) if you need further assistance.\n. I don't think is because how many lines the file has, probably your JsonServer is crashing and restarting in a loop. To enable the debug mode you just need to remove the port in the command that you pasted above, the port is not needed anymore in POSIX platform.\nStart it in debug mode and let's take a look at the log\n. Ok, let's me explain you roughly how anaconda works.\nWhen you open a folder or a project in your Sublime Text 3 in a window, anaconda assigns an unique project name to that window, being this:\n1. The project name itself if a project exists\n2. The first opened directory in the Window if a project is not set\n3. The string \"anaconda-\" followed by the ID of the ST3 window if there are no open directories\nThen, the anaconda's worker starts a JsonServer using the name that we detected in the previous step as value for the -p parameter, as you are in OS X, the JsonSever creates a new UNIX socket in ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Anaconda/<project_name>/anaconda.sock\nThat means that the value used for the parameter -p needs to match with the project or directory that you are gonna try to test. So in your case, you have to change the -p test to -p hardent_tools.\nMake sure that you start the JsonServer while ST3 is completely closed (Cmd+Q)\n. Is not the autocompletion, it is the signatures tooltips requesting the documentation of the symbol under the cursor.\nWhich Python version is that?\nST3 and Anaconda versions as well?\n. There should be something environmental going on here, I just created a file with 8000 lines just duplicating the same code, the linting was a bit slower but the tooltips and completions where as fast as always (the whole package is design to make it fast in that specific scenario).\nCan you try to use another Python interpreter that is not under pyenv please?\n. The logs looks pretty normal to me, you can try to disable the use of docstrings for the tooltips, set this enable_docstrings_tooltip to false in your config, if it doesn't help you can try to disable the display of signatures all together setting display_signatures to false and see if there is any kind of improvement.\n. I am pretty sure that the jsonserver is crashing when the signatures is enabled, is the only thing that could explain the delay, it's hard to try to debug a problem that is not happening to you just using this issues tracker list...\n. Not much really, if you are not using docker, vagrant or remote interpreters is probably fine if you use 1.4.28 anyway, I think if you start the jsonserver manually in debug mode and set the jsonserver_debug as true you will find crash reports in your terminal after a few minutes of use.\nNote: if you enable the jsonserver_debug anaconda will not try to start a jsonserver by itself ever, remmeber to set it as false when you stop your manually started jsonserver.\n. Hi guys,\nCan you please provide your JsonServer logs with the timeframe that you experience the slow down?. Can you try to disable pep257 and try again?. I do not really see many delay in your logs, for example:\n2017-01-29 21:39:28,935: INFO    : client requests: autocomplete\n2017-01-29 21:39:28,955: INFO    : About push back to ST3: b'{\"completions\": [[\"raise\\\\tkeyword\", \"raise\"],\nAs you can see the times looks fine, is just at the end of your previous report that times increase a bit, always under a second, except for the linter (pep257 is pretty expensive by the way).\nI am not able to reproduce this behavior, in my case linting is a bit slow, self introspection is slower than standard library but that is expected. Here a video editing pdb.py\n\n. hey @Cescfangs try to disable MyPy in your settings or just install MyPy for the same Python interpreter that you are using with anaconda.. Hi there guys. I've been finally able to deterministically reproduce this problem in my macOS 10.11.6 so I am currently in a good position to try to solve the issue. I am closing this issue as #620 is a duplicated of this one. \nLet's follow up in the other one.. Hi, thank you for take your time in look into this problem that you had with mypy on Windows. Is very strange that you have any problem with how the command is passed to Popen as shlex takes care of format the arguments right for every platform, I will take a look into it as I think your changes will break POSIX.\nI didn't test the mypy feature on Windows I will take a look as soon as I have some time to do it so I can parse the results for windows and it doesn't fails.\nThe warning that you get can be ignored, just set mypy_silent_imports to true in your configuration.\nMypy does not works in buffers, just in files that is why it only lints on file saving, to make it work as you type we should need to save the buffer to a temporary location every time that 0.5s passed since your last key stroke and that will be very very IO intrusive, we don't like that.\n. About the 0.4.5 support, yep, looks like they broke anaconda with this merge https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/2192 as one of the parameters that we pass to mypy was renamed\n. Working fine for me, shlex was designed just to handle that, I am not sure how is possible that is not working for you, I have no problems really.\n. Yeah you are right, I made a commit to solve it, if Package Control does not automatically updates your installation do a git pull in the anaconda directory.\nP.S: I did not want to do a full release with just that single change\n. The problem of removing the posix=False is that Windows paths are not gonna be corrected in case that they need and the backslashes are gonna get removed, anyway, I will make the change. \n. It is pushed on master, I will make a release when I have more fixes/changes to make a release\n. What I mean is that with posix=False any path with regular slashes will be converted to backslashes, anyway that would not apply as shlex will take the path as a literal and will not try to convert it so it does not really matters.\n. Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it.\n. Just set the path to your rcfile as value for  pylint_rcfile in your project config, user config or anaconda global config.\n. Hi, all I can see is an screenshot of something being linted in that lines\nbut there is no any error context, can you add a screen of the list of the\nerrors?\nOn Oct 13, 2016 5:04 PM, \"vmachiel\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSo 305 regards the two expected blank lines after a function or class\ndefinition. Fair enough, but it also triggers after assignment of global\nvariables and constants.

That is coming directly from the pycodestyle (formerly pep8.py) library and I guess is because the name of those variables contains the word class. This was reported by other user in #542 that even provided a solution in #543 but that is a problem in PyCodeStyle that they must fix themselves we can't just modify a third party library as it will be painful to maintain.\n. In fact the same user made a PR in pycodestyle directly https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/pull/576#pullrequestreview-1514601 but it is waiting merge because of tests (that seems to be now provided), so is a matter of wait.\n. Well, Jedi is already supposed to work cross files for the usages method but it never worked too well, the method that anaconda calls into Jedi also accepts a param `additional_module_paths' but right now does nothing.\n\nIt also seems like the usages method is kind broken in some places as @davidhalter already stated in the Jedi issues tracker, anyway, if you feel brave enough you could try to help David to fix it and contribute to the Jedi project.\nJedi is a pretty awesome library that does a magnific job but it is really complex so good luck if you try to work on it :)\nP.S: Other slower option could be to regex for the name of the symbol in the current project and then make a call to the usages method in the Jedi library in every single file that contains a reference, put the results together and then send it back to anaconda to display the list in the GUI.\nAnyway and as you are already aware, I am currently working in the decoupling of the plugin and the JsonServer so I have too much in my plate, probably is a good exercise to start contributing ;)\n. That sounds like a plan @divinites, anyway, don't subestimate Jedi, it is very fast.\npython\n%timeit s2.usages()\nThe slowest run took 39.20 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.\n100 loops, best of 3: 3.41 ms per loop\n. I am not sure to follow you here, prepare_send_data queries for only one file, the file being edited. What you mean?\n. Probably you want to take a look into the anaconda worker system and to the JsonServer design\nBut in brief, the Worker pass the request to the JsonClient that encode it to JSON then it makes an async request to the JsonServer that process the request in it's handle_command method defined in anaconda_server/jsonserver.py line 119 and use one of the registered handlers for the in use language to process it.\nFor Python all the handlers are located in anaconda_server/handlers and the one that you are looking for is jedi_handler.py and probably you also are looking for anaconda_server/commands/find_usages.py.\n. @davidhalter did you comment in the wrong project?\n. Oh I see, I thought you were speaking about the my PR into Jedi in that context your previous comment made also a lot of sense\n. ST3 version?, Anaconda version?, Any errors in the console?, Any message in the status bar?, Any errors in the JsonServer logs?\n. I have been looking into this and I think I know why is not working for you. Let me explain you how the renaming works.\nAanconda asks jedi for a list of files that reference the symbol under your cursor, then Jedi returns back this list but it can contains files from libraries or even the standard library  so we need a way to know that the file that we are renaming is part of your project path or not.\nTo do that, we check the commonprefix paths between the name of the file that comes back from jedi with the folders that you have open in your ST3 so if the file that you are editing is not in the same path that any of your open folders, it does not get edited. \nThat makes the renaming safe making sure we don't rename symbols in external libraries but that also means that we don't rename anything that is not part of an open folder into ST3. This is a design that probably needs to be review in some moment.\nLet me know if the above could explain your experience.\n. Please, feel free to open if you find the problem persists.\n. No, tank you, the fix is yours :)\n. Hi, can you make it configurable?\nWe already have the anaconda_linter_underlines setting so probably is better to check if this is set as true in the first part of the conditional or even better just check if this is set as true and ignore the mark style alltogether.\n. I know is not a new feature but if I merge this PR no one could get both marks and underlines at the same time. I understand that what you want to achieve is to hide the underlines while you are using any mark style that currently is not possible (and it is possibly wrong), but merging this PR as is will just invert the situation and make impossible to anyone to show the underlines if they are using marks despite of the configuration of anaconda_linter_underlines.\nThat is why I am asking to modify your PR to make the option of show underlines completely configurable independently of the marks configuration (that was probably a bad design from the beginning).\n. I did not meant that hiding underlines while using marks is wrong, I meant that don't allow the user to decide when to show underlines is wrong.\n. Yup, that is just what I asked in my first comment :+1: \n. No worries :)\nI will merge it on next release\n. @muffinmad even if this PR was merged, looks like it's functionality has been override by another PR, do you want to restore this functionality or are you happy with the new GotoAssignments?\n. Hi, two things \n1) Can you try disabling the imports validation?\n2) Do you always get the Bad File Descriptor error?\n. The imports validator is being fired despite what you have in your configuration, make sure you are not overriding the configuration in your project settings. I will try to reproduce the goto problem later in my Linux box.\n. I already fixed the problem in the imports validator, it will be live on next release.\nDe nada.\n. Are you asking if would be acceptable that you implement the command yourself? If that is the case, PRs are more than welcome but remember to follow the developers guidelines and add a test case for the new feature.\n. I don't think we are able to do anything  beyond define the anaconda methods as disabled (that we already do).\n. After merge your other branches, this PR became conflictive, can you solve it please?\n. The autocompletion gives you what you tell him to give you. This is from the anaconda configuration file\n``` javascript\n/*\n        If complete_parameters is true, anaconda will add function and class\n        parameters to its completions.\n    If complete_all_parameters is true, it will add all the possible\n    parameters, if it's false, it will add only required parameters\n*/\n\"complete_parameters\": false,\n\"complete_all_parameters\": false,\n\n```\nThe print function gets completed as any other function as there is nothing special about it, the behaviour that you get is expected behaviour taking into account your configuration.\n. Why did you close this PR?\n. As I can see in the logs, your client works fine so you can just ignore the errors setting the swallow_startup_errors to true.\nClosing and as it is duplicated of the already open #527\n. The marks is just the plugin linter telling you that there are violations of the Python Code Style Guide (PEP8) in your code\n. Hi, seems like you need to update your ST3 version, yes, there is, just use Alt+-\nUpdate ST3 and feel free to close this issue if that solved your problem.\n. You have to configure a Python3 interpreter as your python_interpreter value in any level of your settings.\n. I understand that you are using the anaconda Python distribution. Can you paste your python_interpreter configuration?\n. Just cd to ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib in your terminal and then run:\npython -c \"import jedi; print(jedi.Script('import cv2; cv2.').completions());\"\nIf you get a result like:\npython\n[<Completion: cv2>, <Completion: os>, <Completion: sys>, <Completion: __doc__>, <Completion: __file__>, <Completion: __name__>, <Completion: __package__>]\nthen that means that anaconda should work with your current configuration.\nAnyway, I found that Jedi, the library that we use to offer auto-completions has some kind of problem with cv2 and it crashes at some levels. There is an open ticket in https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/777\n. Waiting for fix in Jedi\n. Why you want to disable the linting in an unsaved buffer? If you are creating the file, just follow PEP8, if you don't want to follow PEP8 just disable the linter completely or just disable PEP8 linter.\nDisable linter on this file do what it indicates, disable the linter \"on files\", a ST3 buffer is not a file.\n. Being honest, I have no time to implement new features because of https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/projects but I can guide you into how this specific feature works right now so you can implement it yourself if you wish (and make a PR).\n. This feature will be present in v2.1.10. I will take a look into it as soon as I have some free time, time that currently I don't have so for now I suggest you to add it to your environment.\n. This has been solved, pending for release\n. Are you sure that your cursor was over the word sys?. I am not able to reproduce this.\n. The autoimport command is a very simple an naive implementation that just get whatever word is under the cursor and check if it is in the linted errors list and it's description contains the word Undefined, there is not much else in there, you can take a look at the code at  https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/commands/autoimport.py\n. If linting is disabled, anaconda can not possible know if a symbol is not defined so yes, that is why is failing. About SublimeLinter, nope, the new SublimeLinter is still slower than anaconda as it is still using a thread based Queue that locks the ST3 python interpreter GIL while anaconda uses an asynchronous client-server approach that does not lock the GIL or the GUI.\nSaid that, I have plans to improve all the linting related code and modernize it to make it comparable to the current SublimeLinter linting style.\n. Can not replicate, make sure you don't have any configuration triggering your auto completion when you type the : (that probably is your problem actually).\n. It is in the Contextual menu (right mouse click)\n. Well, you can add whatever shortcut that you want in your keybindings. If you add it to the Command Palette I will merge the PR\n. You probably want to report this into https://github.com/pycqa/pycodestyle project, we use them to lint PEP8.\nIn the meanwhile you can add W503 to the pep8_ignore list in your settings.\n. Or better, just disable SublimeCodeIntel that is making your Sublime Text 3 to fire the autocompletion dialog when you type : in python files what is just beyond stupid :)\nOther people reported this as well, for example in #583 \n. What is your python_interpreter?. The weird part is that the error your system is giving you is \"Bad file descriptor\", it is like the socket was open readonly and you are trying to write on it but that does not have any sense.\nIs the problem consistent? You can reproduce it every time that you try or you get this just some times?\nSomething that I don't understand is:\nYour vagrant config is for an OSX machine but the errors you posted are from a Linux box, can you elaborate please?. I see.\nDo you get that error everytime that you start your ST3 or just in occasions?\nIs anaconda working using a local python_interpreter?. Yes it should, the vagrant interpreter just add some additional functionality in top of regular TCP remote workers (like start the VM or start the minserver.py in the VM if is not already running).. What you mean with \"mapping doesn't work correctly\"?. Ok, do the following:\n\nOpen ST3 console and write\nfrom Anaconda.anaconda_lib.workers.market import Market\nprint(Market)\nThe command above will show you a list of workers in your market, write down the Window ID of your worker\nw = Market().get(<the_window_id_you_wrote_down>)\nprint(w.interpreter)\nprint(w.interpreter.pathmap)\n\nPaste here the results please\n. Looks like the code to handle the mappings when data come from the workers is gone (or it was never commit), that is why Goto does not works.\ncommands/goto.py line 46 should check for active interpreter maps if the interpreter is remote and replace the paths accordingly. I will look into it when I have some time.. You don't get the bad file descriptor error anymore?. Duplictae of #527 . Can you please provide the contents of your JsonServer logs? (https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md#anacondas-jsonserver-logs) \nP.S: The ISSUE_TEMPLATE is there for a reason btw. Resolved, waiting for release. Please, confirm that the fix is actually working in your case, feel free to re-open if not.. Don't bother with updating manually, just wait until Package Control gets aware of the new version.. @kiddick could you confirm that this is actually fixed please?\nThanks.. Has been fixed in a PR minutes ago https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/pull/593\nTry to reinstall anaconda. Thanks, I will release the fix later today. Fixed in v2.1.9. Sadly, ST3 API does not offers too many things to play with, the only floating windows are the popups and they disappear as soon as a key is pressed. Then we have phantoms, but those are attached to a specific Region (line and column) so they don't follow you if you scroll the window.\nIt is not possible to dock the panel (that would be actually cool), so the only thing that comes to my mind is use some sort of bottom panel but that is not trivial or fast.. Nope, there are no shorcuts because I consider them invasive, I should really remove all the defined anaconda shortcuts so the user can add whatever they like.\nThe command to run from a shortcut is anaconda_get_lines. Yes, they help, I don't use the mouse neither, I use the Command Palette to invoke actions but there are a lot of possibilities that I override any keybinding that other plugin, window manager or Operating System is already using so I prefer the user takes control over key bindings.\nI could think about something to possibly support this request but currently I am pretty busy.. Thanks for the quick fix. Yeah, I know, I had something in mind but what I don't have is enough time . Totally agreed, take into account that anaconda tooltips where introduced as soon as ST3 API supported the first ever version of minihtml, in was pretty bad at the moment and the hardcoded CSS and theme was needed. \nNow things have improved in the ST3 API and there is no need anymore for the hardcoded templates, that is something that I will change in some moment and I am totally aware of.. By the way, you can override the default anaconda CSS styles creating a directory called Anaconda.themes in your Packages/User and saving there your own CSS files. Good catch.\nIf I understand this, the Python interpreter running the  JsonServer socket module is using the enum module inside anconda_lib instead of the one in it's own library path?\nI use Python 3.5 and never had this problem and I am not able to reproduce it myself, anyway, I will update the enum module in the anaconda_lib so you can test it yourself.\nAnd good catch again.. Unfortunately the fix breaks anaconda_go so it will take a while. The file is called aenum.py not enum.py, by the way, why you have a subdirectory of the same directory as your PYHONTPATH you should have only one of them. \nIf you could paste the errors that you get I would probably offer much better help than just guessing. Even that anaconda should gracefully failing on this, the problem is that Jedi does not supports Python 2.6 grammars yet and you are using a Python 3.6 interpreter. Even if I add some try block or use get in the dictionary object (that I should) you are never gonna make lot of functionality offered by Jedi to work, not unless Python 3.6 grammars are added to the library.. Did you test this with different test suites?. To be released alter today. Isort is being included into Golconda-contrib-python (the future successor of anaconda) but there are no plans to include it in anaconda itself, as anaconda will become kind of obsolete as soon as Golconda gets released.\nI am not sure if I am gonna convert this repository into Golconda-contrib-python or I will add a new package into PackageControl with a new repo.. Sorry for the delay @AndreasBackx \nI've been working a lot in Golconda, I already have the plugin connector (that exposes the internal language plugins trough the Golconda REST API) ready and I am writing the plugins for the Golang and Python languages. This last process is the most hard as I have to add all the features that anaconda already have into the Python plugin and as you already know, anaconda is huge in features.\nAfter that is done, I have to prepare a new plugin for ST3 and common Package Control dependency libraries to add the ST3 specific anaconda features.\nI don't have an estimation yet, the progress is slow as I don't have too many time to work in the project now but I will make public the repositories as soon as the code is cleaned a bit, right now is full of specific hacks for POC it needs refactor before to open it.\nThe repos are already on Github but they are marked as private for now.. I am working in the Package Control dependency but sadly I am busier than ever as I am also moving house.. Can you provide the information that you did not in the issue template?. You probably want to monitor https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/805. To be released later today. Jedi does not supports Python 3.6 yet, just wait. Hi, currently anaconda does not apply any kind of syntax highlight to Python files but relies in syntax highlighters (from third parties) to know when a Python source file is being edited. \nIs not in our aim to implement any kind of syntax highlighter into anaconda and continue relying in the different highlighters for Python available for Sublime Text 3.\nThere are actually three packages implementing Cython support in Package Control: https://packagecontrol.io/search/cython\nJust install any of them, if the files are highlighted as Python code, anaconda will recognize them as Python code as anaconda uses ST3 builting source recognition capabilities that are tied to syntax highlight.. No problem. I see that Arch updated it's Python version to Python 3.6 already, awesome. I will update it as soon as I test that the plugin works with latest Jedi master version (that is not always true). In the meanwhile, you could probably add the parser/grammar3.6.txt from the jedi to ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/ it will probably work.. I will release a new version with the last master Jedi later today. That is not currently implemented but is interesting . Function get_interpreter in anaconda_lib/helpers.py that is being used in anaconda_lib/workers/interpreter.py and anaconda_lib/workers/market.py. Then there is a direct access to the settings in decorators.py but the function doing it was deprecated long ago in 2.0.0 and is not being used anymore.. Hi @j9ac9k \nYou can easily check which python interpreter is in use writing the following in the ST3 console (I should probably add a command to do it or something)\npython\nfrom Anaconda.anaconda_lib.workers.market import Market\nprint(Market.lookup(window.id()).interpreter). Your problem is that Sublime Text 3 in macOS and GNU/Linux does not import the environment variables that yous $SHELL defines, so even if in the terminal the python in your path is pointing to let's say /user/local/bin/python that does not meas that it will point to the same path in your ST3.. Only ST3 can give you an answer to that question, I guess you can do something like this in the ST3 console:\npython\nimport subprocess; subprocess.check_output(['python', '-c', \"import sys; print(sys.executable);\"])\n. This gets the tab_size directly from Sublime Text 3 settings right?. It may take a while until I merge this PR into the master branch but it will be merged.. This will be release today. You are using an almost one year old anaconda version, install a recent version.\nThis report is pretty annoying by the way, there is much better ways to ask for support than what you did.. The documentation is at your disposal in the following link http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/ \nI am complaining about the way that you wrote your ticket, the irony and the aggressive tone like \"errors that make no sense\".\nThere are thousand of users that use this plugin every day, if you get an error is because probably there is a problem with your configuration/environment,  the errors makes perfect sense and they are triggered for good reasons.\nDo not forget that we support and maintain this software freely, being nice is also free.. Well is hard to get the tone of things in written media, you know.\nCan you paste your settings here? Make sure that you understood about the different configuration levels, some times people is overriding the settings in a more specialized level and they get unexpected results.. If I understood, the problem was gone after you set auto_python_builder_enabled to false? That is interesting.\nAnaconda tries to add a custom Python Builder using your configured python_interpreter when it first initializes its workers. It first checks that a project exists for the active window session and if it does, then it calls the necessary methods to update your project python builder settings passing your python_interpreter to them.\nFor some reason your Python interpreter was set as None and that is why you were getting the error message. You were getting it twice because anaconda tries to initialize it's workers subsystem asynchronously so your client tried to start another worker to make the Python Builder to work while the first worker was already initializing the system.\nWhich other plugins do you have installed alongside anaconda?. We have a winner, SublimeCodeIntel is known for being a bad neighbour, you need to disable it for Python (if it allows you to do it at all) or just disable the whole thing while you use Anaconda, it is known to interfere with any other auto-completion plugin and they hardcode things like trigger autocompletion events when you write the colon symbol (that is completely useless and annoying in Python code cos you get an auto-completion popup just before hit enter after a conditional or function declaration or loop or whatever that ends in colon).\nPython 3 works fine with anaconda.. You are welcome, and sorry for the miss understanding \ud83d\udc4d . That is interesting, I will think about it but probably for golconda (next big anaconda iteration). The popup can disappear for different reasons, by default anaconda instructs Sublime to maintain the popup visible and to interact with the autocompletion popup, there is not much else that we can do to make Sublime to do not make it disappear.\nIf you really want to be able to see the signatures I recommend you to disable the signatures popup, anaconda will show you the signatures in the status bar instead, to do so, you can set the option enable_signatures_tooltip as false in the configuration.\nYou can also enable the complete_parameters and alternatively the complete_paramaters_all that will write the arguments for you in a snippet as soon as you write down the ( character, you can iterate over the arguments using the tab key.\nIf you are installing anaconda trough PackageControl you probably already have the latest version but if you want to be 100% sure you can always open your ST3 console and write:\npython\nfrom Anaconda.version import version\nprint(version). The ST3 popup functionality is pretty convoluted, I will try to improve the overall user experience in the next anaconda big iteration as I will be rewriting all the ST3 related stuff from scratch.\nDid you try to enable complete_parameters? I think that will do wonders for your use case.. I experience the same behavior that you do, I will accept any PR if you are eager to try to find a fix but I have already a lot in my plate. I am so sorry for not being more helpful but I like to be honest and currently I am putting my efforts in Golconda that will improve and replace anaconda.. That's right, anaconda and Jedi can not coexists in the same ST3 installation..

Just remove SublimeJedi and if you have problems follow the suggestions of the previous post. Anaconda does not binds the parentheses, please comments about other projects to their respective repos. Anaconda doesn't add any key binding for the left parenthesis as I already said in the previous comment..  You should probably try to open a ticket in the project that is actually setting the binding, Anaconda does not set any binding in your left parenthesis, you can complain as much as you want in here but there is nothing that we can do about because that binding is being set by other plugin.. Thanks for the PR, I will include it in the next release. To run the tests run nosetests3 test in the anaconda directory.. I will release this later today @akdor1154 \nI made some modifications in the top of your PR:\n\nMade MyPy tests to be skipped in Python 3 if MyPy is not installed\nFix some pep8 volations\nAdded support for Python 3.6. Anaconda does not log into Syslog (https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py#L259)\n\nDo you think you have some global configuration to log python logs trough the logging standard library into syslog?. There is a PR waiting to get merged that fixes that problem: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/pull/606. The PR has been merged today, so now, anaconda will use the same indentation that you have configured in your ST3 for the file that you are editing.. Sorry for the delay, I've been busy.  You will probably have some errors in the anaconda server logs as it looks to me like the server is crashing and restarting again and that is why you feel the slowness, as you can see in the attached video I am not able to reproduce it using the file that you provided.\n\nShow your ST3 console and write:\npython\nfrom Anaconda.anaconda_lib.workers.market import Market\nprint(Market.get(Market, window.id()).interpreter)\nCopy the result and paste it in your terminal, come back with any results.. If the plugin had any kind of performance problem it should appear in all the platforms, there is some other macOS users with performance problems, all of them since Sierra update if I am not mistaken. I do not believe in coincidences probably there is something that is affecting ST3 itself, or making the socket module of the ST3 embedded interpreter to misbehave.\nI have been never able to reproduce it by  myself on any of my boxes (I use OSX El Capitan and I am not planing to update it to Sierra any time soon). To properly investigate this I must be able to reproduce it or wotk with someone that has the problem and have the time and the motivation to try to go deeper until we can find the cause of the problem and find a solution.\nRelated: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/558. I could reproduce it with the sample file in macOS without update to Sierra. I will take a deeper look into it to try to find the cause of the problem and provide a satisfactory solution.\nPlease let's maintain just a single ticket for this issue, I will proceed to close #558 so we can follow up the issue in this one.. This issue has been resolved and it's fix will be released later today\nNote: do not use UNIX Domain Sockets in macOS, seriously, don't. This issue must be fixed as per release v2.116 \nSorry to all macOS users for the delay but just reproduce and understand the issue was a really long task and I am a very busy person.\nFeel free to re-open if you find any more related problems (that I hope you don't). What you are describing is the autocompletion and not the linting, anyway, that is normal when the plugin loads an huge module as pandas for the first time as it has to analyze it and cache it, but that is just the first time that it gets loaded, after that everythign must come from the cache.. It looks good, but it would look even better if the user had any way to restyle the look of the phantom with some CSS. In my case for example, as I am using some custom theme it looks huge.\n\n. That package mdpopups is the reason that mine looks as huge as it does. You are hardcoding the HTML element and style of the phantom in like 245:\n python\ncontent = \"\"\"<pre style=\"color: red\"> {}</pre>\"\"\".format(errors)\nA better option will be to class that pre tag (like <pre class=\"anaconda-lint\">) and put the CSS in the css/phantom.css directory in the root of the plugin and then load that CSS so we can give theme designers and end users a chance to change it if they do not like it or if it does not fit well in their active themes.\nYou have examples of how to do that in listeners/signatures.py line 117-120 and anaconda_lib/tooltips.py in the Tooltip class, it does not necessarily needs to be as complex as that, a simple function that loads the CSS from the file system (and cache it) using a setting option (defaulted to our file inside the css directory) will be enough.\n. Way better \ud83d\udc4d . You don't really need to do all that to just split the messages in different phantoms, in fact you are doing lot of unnecessary computation that is later not even used as every call to get_lineno_errors retrieves data for all different error levels but you just really need the information from one of them.\nYou can simplify all this PR into just:\n```diff\n--- a/anaconda_lib/linting/sublime.py\n+++ b/anaconda_lib/linting/sublime.py\n@@ -235,12 +235,13 @@ def add_lint_marks(view, lines, **errors):\n             vid = view.id()\n             phantoms = []\n             for level in ['ERRORS', 'WARNINGS', 'VIOLATIONS']:\n-                for line in ANACONDA.get(level)[vid]:\n-                    phantoms.append({\n-                        \"line\": line,\n-                        \"level\": level.lower(),\n-                        \"messages\": \"\\n\".join(get_lineno_msgs(view, line))\n-                    })\n+                for line, messages in ANACONDA.get(level)[vid].items():\n+                    for msg in messages:\n+                        phantoms.append({\n+                            \"line\": line,\n+                            \"level\": level.lower(),\n+                            \"messages\": msg\n+                        })\n             phantom.update_phantoms(view, phantoms)\n     for lint_type, lints in get_outlines(view).items():\n\n``\n. Thanks, I will merge it on next release.. This will be released today. Can you add a snippet of code that reproduces the problem?\nWhich version of Python are you using?. Hi @SylvainDe \nYes, please, remove the 3.7-dev and nightly, Jedi fails miserably as it does not have syntax definitions for them yet.. Hi \nWhat happens if you connect withcurl,ncorhttpiedirectly into yourlocalhost:9998because I don't see how the port19360that you are binding yourjsonserverinstance into your container is exposed to the host. . Expose the port19360` instead, I think there is probably a typo in the wiki examples. No problem I will fix the wiki examples. Are you using a Python3 interpreter?. That just looks like the signatures being interfered by other plugin and making it to flicker. Which other plugins do you have installed alongside anaconda?\nYou can disable the signatures setting enable_signatures_tooltip as false in your configuration.. Can you reproduce the hanging processes just restarting your ST3 in a consistent way? I couldn't reproduce any of your problems.\nIn fact anaconda does not insert any text shown in the tooltips that is a feature that does not exist in the plugin.. What I mean is that anaconda just inserts any code in autocompletion events and that is. I do not know why that last path is getting inserted maybe if you paste here your settings it will help as well.. It would be very useful to know if someone else is having problems with Jedi in 2.1.17 as I updated it, so probably there is a problem with it. Tells Package Control to not update anaconda at use previous version for now w. SublimeJedi and Anaconda can not work together, disable SublimeJedi.. You were lucky I was in front of the computer :). Looks like this comes directly from PyFlakes \nAnd it is already reported: https://bugs.launchpad.net/pyflakes/+bug/1666811. I have been investigating this much deeper and seems like the AST coming from the compiled code object that comes directly from the Python compiler itself sets the line number as 1 for that specific node into the tree what seems to be wrong but I do not really know how the f-string PEP is internally implemented. And digging a bit more into the CPython internals I found that the node lineno is set as it is extracted with the LINENO macro when the f-string is being parsed but for some reason it does not provides correct line numbers. I headed to the Python issue tracker to fill a new bug about it but seems like there is already one going on.\nDo not expect this to be fixed any time soon.. Just an update to understand why this is happening (just a reminder for myself really). The literal formatted string is just syntactic sugar, the Python interpreter is parsing the code and creating tokens, then those tokens are used by the lexical analyzer to create a concrete syntax tree (CST)  that is then converted into a much more useful abstract syntax tree (AST) that is what PyFlakes and other analysis tools finally use.\nThe f-string implementation is a bit lazy or sloppy if you prefer and instead of create a new token type like FSTRING and then properly analyze the expression to split it into more tokens it just created a new token of type STRING like in our example:\nSTRING         \"f'{x}'\"\nThis is later parsed by the fstring_find_expr function from Python/ast.c that after perform some checks like the literal contains { characters (for the wildcards) it just generates a new string on the fly using the fstring_compile_expr function (also defined in Python/ast.c) thar returns an expr_ty taht is then formatted.\nThe problem is that new generated expression loses any context information so it defines by default line and column numbers (being both 1) for the enclosed variable names (that are created directly as an AST node by PyParser_ASTFromString in Python/pythonrun.c).\nI would like to contribute with a fix for this directly into the CPython project but I think the implementation is not the best that Python as seen so I do not feel like doing it really.. I did rollback latest Jedi update, let me know if 2.1.18 fixes the issue.. Ok, so I am closing it for now, feel free to reopen if you find something. I am trying to find the issue and solve it as we really need to update to the latest Jedi version to solve some high memory consumption when using certain libraries so I need to know which libraries where you using in your project and which Python version.. I am not sure about this, with that change older versions of MyPy will not work with anaconda, in fact if we merge this we will be forcing the users to update to MyPy 0.501, apart from that and as I just rollback the version of anaconda that you derived your code from you should rebase this in the top of mater as this PR merge will re introduce the rollback code.\nCan you please rebase the PR? I will take a deeper look as soon as I have some time after the rebase is done.\nThanks.. I understand what you say about updating but not every user would like to mess their package manager with pip installations (a clear example of that is Archlinux or Manjaro failing to upgrade or install any package that depends on MyPy if there is any pip file installed in site-packages).\nI know the user can install it in their local spaces but not every user is gonna use the --user flag in their pip install command.\nYou will be amazed with the high percentage of people that send logs where I can see that they have MyPy enabled but they do not have it installed on the system (the JsonSever logs that scenario).. No, what I mean is that any package that depends on MyPy will fail to install as MyPy will. There is a discussion about what to do with MyPy integration going on. I normally copy the previous one and edit it :P. Finally fixed the typo (after I already released it xD). I will try to reproduce it, things go rogue when two windows are open using the same project is probably logical on Linux as there is only one Unix Domain Socket and two windows trying to start anaconda server over that socket, with only one window is weird.\nWhat I can see in the logs is that Jedi breaks.. Ok I did several crazy things to try to reproduce the logs that @robmcmullen pasted but I was not able to make Jedi go rogue I just exhausted my computer RAM and had to restart.\nTo do so, I had to open 7 windows in a project that was using wxPython, each instance of Jedi that needs to complete wxPython uses 6Gb of memory (I have 32GB on this computer)\nJedi seems to use that huge amount of memory always that imports the xwPython module as use iPython demonstrates\n22233 damnwid+  20   0 6457.0m 6.005g   0.0 19.1   0:25.90 S ipython2\nWe have a problem here because the last version of Jedi that is on master, fixed this problem, this is the comparative between the current jedi version bundled into anaconda and the latest one:\nAnaconda's bundled version:\n17880 damnwidge  20   0 6399M 6156M  8300 S  0.0 19.2  0:00.00 /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/ipython2\nLatest Jedi version:\n15365 damnwidge  20   0  574M  186M 25200 S  0.0  0.6  0:00.00 /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/ipython2\nAs you can see, is much better but we have a problem with the latest Jedi version but that version caused some performance issues in OSX and I had to rollback it https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/632\nSo  what we have here is a big problem to me because I do not have the time to hunt down the problem in OSX and update Jedi, apart from that latest version of Jedi API is not compatible with anaconda and I had to modify anaconda to make it work with it so it is not an in-drop replacement and probably that could be causing some issue.\nI will update this as soon as I have anything to update.\nP.S: as a suggestion, try to do not open more than one window into the project and if you do use another Python interpreter for the second one, one interpreter that does not see the library that is using too many memory. I think is easier if you just use the jedi_bump anaconda branch . @qocu did you try the jedi_bump branch? It improved your experience?. On linux you have to use the same name as your project for the -p argument when you start the server in debug mode as ST3 will connect to a Unix Domain Socket, I also recommend to delete the socket file if it already exists before to start the server, the .sock file will be located at ~/.local/share/anaconda/run/<project>/anaconda.sock. The strange thing about these logs of yours is that there is no error, just traceback so we do not even know what the problem is. To enable Jedi to print to the stdout just add set_debug_function() to anaconda_lib/jedi/api/__init__.py after sys.setrecursionlimit(2000) and before the class class NotFOundError. I think the best option here is open a bug in the Jedi repository, my exposure to Jedi internal is not so good but I think star imports should not produce any problem.. Anaconda version @AndreasBackx?. Can you reproduce it as you wish? If so, can I have the code that triggers the issue and an explanation about how to reproduce it?. Hi @AndreasBackx \nWhen Jedi goes rogue you can notice it immediately because anaconda stops working, no linting, no completions or any other anaconda feature. It will be useful if you also have a terminal tailing the JsonServer logs as you will see that it stalls trying to do goto_definition when doc is being called. If you are able to provide with a method to reproduce I will be able to fix it (I could reproduce with python 2.7 in the previous version of anaconda but I can't  reproduce it anymore since v2.1.20).. I am afraid that there is no trivial solution for this problem, it is direct consequence of a poor design choice on my side when I implemented the feature, solve it will require a complete redesign of a couple of critical systems. \nI am currently putting my effort in Golconda that is gonna eventually replace this project and is much better designed, in fact, this same very problem is already fixed in Golconda as the design already took care of handling the completion parameters in a much better way.\nMy only suggestion is to disable the complete_parameters feature if it really bothers and annoy you to that level, I am sorry that I can not be more helpful at this time.. That sounds like a good idea, I will totally accept a PR implementing it, is not like I am working in another project, I a working in the next version of anaconda (just with another name!).. You should call it using the ST3 API function run_command in a valid view object. So for example if you put your cursor in a ( symbol of a function call in your code and open the ST3 console and write:\npython\nview.run_command('anaconda_complete_funcargs')\nIt will execute it . Really?. It is actually how anaconda calls it https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/listeners/completion.py#L75. The only thing that I do not like about the solution is that it sets a settings options to track state. Why don't you change the setting write/read for a static variable in the class?\nP.S: there are better ways to handle this with more advanced usage of the API like for example using TM contexts but is not bad for \"a beginner\" like you said, good thinking.. There are mechanisms in ST3 to capture any keystroke, the on_query_context method of the sublime_plugin.EventListener class, example of usage:\n```python\nimport sublime_plugin\nclass TestListener(sublime_pluign.EventListener):\n    _ready_to_rock = False\n    def on_query_context(self, view, key, operator, operand, match_all):\n        if key == 'anaconda_ready_for_funcargs':\n            value = TestListener._ready_to_rock\n            if operator == sublime.OP_EQUAL:\n                return operand == value\n            if operator == sublime.OP_NOT_EQUAL:\n                return operand != value\n    return None\n\n```\nAnd the keybinding:\n{\"keys\": [\"tab\"], \"command\": \"anaconda_fill_funcargs\", \"context\": [{\"key\": \"anaconda_ready_for_funcargs\"}]}. On query context is just implementing a key binding using a conditional, the same that you are doing with your code, the only difference is that it doesn't needs to call the settings artifacts in order to work. In your solution, the setting is gonna be written into the disk everytime that it gets saved, it is gonna be written into Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings is gonna use an artifact (the settings sub system) that is gonna do unnecessary I/O and is gonna use it to solve a problem that can be totally solved with the proper API artifacts.. You should really use the operator and operand parameters so we (or the users) can define different behaviors (if we/they want) just modifying the key binding. My suggestion is to assign the result of checkpos to a temp variable (like value) and then use the conditionals if operator == sublime.OP_EQUAL and if operator == sublime.OP_NOT_EQUAL for True and False respectively.\nBy the way on_query_context will return None and not False in it's last line because if you return False in there you are capturing the tab key for any context in the whole ST3 including non python files.\nThe AnacondaFillFuncargs  is still setting and unsetting options that is what I wanted to avoid in first instance.\nI think the right place to make the modifications is in the complete_func_args.py code modifying how the complete func args itself works (that is heavily inspired in SublimeJedi functionality) as despite it works is clearly not a good design.\nI really appreciate the effort that you put into this but I will finish it myself (as I think is gonna be much easier for me as I am familiar with the code and ST3 internals), the way that I solved this problem in golconda is way cleaner as I attach the func arguments completion to the completion itself and there is no additional completion when the ( is used, but that requires a total redesign from scratch of the completions implementation. I will implement your solution as soon as possible (probably this weekend).\nI invite you to continue playing and hacking anaconda and ST3 and I will answer any question that you could have (when I have time to do it) even by email, I think you could really help anaconda and other projects out there and have fun and learn in the process.\n\ud83d\udc4d \n. Be careful with the view settings, they get written into the project file as well.. This happens in every project configuration file?. That sounds like a weird setup. \nDo you need different interpreters in each of those projects?\nWhy do you add the directories of a project as a folder in other project?\n. I am not sure why that could be happening but in the meanwhile, I suggest you to open the project that you want to get inspiration from in a new ST3 window instead that in the same one.\nI was asking about the python interpreters because if it was the same one you can create a single project and then add all the folders to it.. Can you explain me how you think anaconda installs all by himself in your computer after you remove it? If you are using Package Control (that you are because you directory name is Anaconda and git installations are anaconda in lowers) just use the Package Control uninstall command because is more than probably that Package Control is reinstalling the plugin.\nIf you think the rectangles are \"so silly\" you have several options to disable the whole linter, or even just disable the rectangles or modify the look and feel of the linter reports in any imaginable way as absolute all the anaconda features are configurable and possible to turn off.\nA quick look at the config file will suffice to know how to properly configure it to adapt it's behavior to your needs but you can also find all the related information in the extensive AnacondaST3 users documentation:\n Disabling the linter\n Linter Look & Feel\nIf you don't know how to use Package Control it's official documentation site will be a good starting point . Two things to take into account.\n\nAre you sure that your configured python interpreter can see the pandas library in any of its import paths?\nThe pandas library is huge, first time that Jedi parses it takes a while then it's contents are cached into memory so further access will be faster, that means that the first autocompletion is very slow or never happens.\n\nThere is also a known problem about performance with pandas library more info. What suppress_word_completions does is tell ST3 to don't show completions based in the context of the buffer being edited but just when we have completions to show from Jedi. You can check if the anaconda's shipped version of Jedi is able to complete any library just going to ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib then run your python interpreter (all of this from the command line) and writing:\npython\nfrom jedi import Script\nprint(Script('import pandas;pandas.').completions())\nIf you get an empty list, then Jedi is not able to complete the library (pandas here was just an example).. Hi @ScottTyson \nRun the following in your anaconda's terminal:\npython\nimport jedi\nprint(jedi.__version__)\nPaste results here. Version bundled with anaconda is 0.10.3 can you cd into your anaconda ST3 plugin's jedi bundled version (~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib for macOS) and run:\nPYTHONPATH=. python -c \"import jedi; print(jedi.Script('import pandas;pandas.').completions())\"\nDo you get any result?. You can use a python interpreter as python_interpreter setting from a virtual environment and install a most recent version of jedi into that virtual environment, if that doesn't work I am afraid that your only choice i wait till we upgrade our support for newest versions of Jedi that might support the library that you want to complete from but right now we have no time, no volunteers to maintain the plugin.. Those are regular ST3 shortcuts defined in anaconda, although the shortcuts are defined to use the Alt key and not the graphics Alt.\nGo to the anaconda shortcuts settings in your ST3 preferences -> packages -> anaconda menu, then delete or comment any shortcut that interferes with your workflow.. I am afraid that is a Jedi problem. This should really be fixed in the MarkDown files that generates the documentation pages, do you think you can make the PR there?\nThis is the repo URL: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda.github.io. You can modify the anaconda key bindings editing directly the plugin key-bindings file in Preferences -> Packages -> Anaconda -> Key Bindings (Default) that will override the conflicting binding.\nP.S: sorry for the delay I've been traveling for the past two weeks. I am glad to know, I am closing this, feel free to re-open if you have any further problems. Did you try to use the aggressive setting in your preferences?, you can set it to whatever number that you need or think is good for you, more info. Anaconda does not decides when or how to show the autocompletion popup but injects it's results on it. It is possible to do what you are asking for but we must hook into global key-bindings and I don't like the idea.. I am afraid that this is a problem with Jedi and not with Anaconda, so probably will be better if you open an issue (if there is not an open issue already). Can't reproduce I just get E501 with the sample code, I am using:\n Arch Linux \n ST3 3126\n* Anaconda v2.1.18. I did not had time to look into it, I am really busy, if you think you can investigate this I will be more than happy to accept a PR.. That is a well known limitation of Sublime Text 3 itself and the solution is in our README.md file (just follow this link). It is normal that the solution for SublimeJedi does not works, it is another totally different plugin.\nP.S: I recommend to disable SublimeJedi while you use anaconda, they interfere with each other.. I am afraid that this is not the project page of the anaconda distribution project you should direct your requests to the continuum anaconda issues tracker. Can you provide your JsonServer Logs please?. This is related with #680 and #691 and should be fixed now.. That looks like a bug in Jedi, can you try to use the jedi_bump branch (available on this repo) and let me know if it improves?\nP.S: If you don't know how to use a branch from the repo in your ST3 let me know so I can explain you how to do it.. Thank you for your kind words, I just wish I has more time to can work more in the project.. There is no anaconda_goto_definition command but anaconda_goto or anaconda_goto_usages.. How is this related with anaconda exactly? If you need that, just create a custom build with that.. Pretty sure that you did not configured anaconda to use a Python3 interpreter, take a look at the documentation. We should probably update the PyCodeStyle library, I will try to find some time to do it during the weekend.. Unfortunately I don't have any spare time right now so I can not look into new features but in the meanwhile you can disable the linting in the files that you want. To do so, just open the file and then use the command palette Anaconda: Disable linting on this file and anaconda will not try to lint the file that you are editing in that moment.\nThis is persistent between sessions so you don't have to do it every time that you open the file, if for any reason you need to enable the file linting again just use Anaconda: Enable linting on this file command palette entry.. Yeah, I can imagine that.. Did you try to disable the tooltips and just use show documentation?\nOn May 25, 2017 15:03, \"Logi\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI like the anaconda anaconda tooltip display but I think it's too\nintrusive as it pops up while I'm typing and hides part of my code.

Hi,\nAbout 1, that is a limitation of Jedi, if anaconda does not offers completions is because Jedi doesn't return any (by the way, multiple module imports in the same line is a PEP8 violation)\n\nAbout 2, did you tried to enable the parameters completion?. Set complete_parameters as true in teh configuration.. Are you sure that you configured a Pyuthon3 interpreter?. Open your ST3 and edit a Python file in your project, open the ST3 console and write t he following:\npython3\nfrom Anaconda.anaconda_lib.workers.market import Market; Market.get(Market, window.id()).interpreter\nPaste here what you get back..

Where do you installed the Python interpreter?. Then is pretty normal that you can't find the Python path as you didn't installed it. You should take a look at https://www.python.org/. Anaconda is just a plugin for ST3 that enhances the Python developers experience when they write or navigate Python code using ST3, we don't provide, support or maintain any Python interpreter or distribution in any way.\nIs better if  you start learning about Python itself before to worry about editors or editor plugins.. SublimeCodeIntel interfere with any other completion plugin, Anaconda and SublimeCodeIntel doesn't work together, you must choose to use one or another.\nP.S: If you configure anaconda right yo should not have any need to use SublimeCodeIntel. Anaconda can see whatever your configured python interpreter can see. I suggest you to take a look at the documentation web site http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/  specially the section related with configure the interpreter http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/\nAnaconda uses Jedi to complete python code, Jedi is way more powerful than code intel.. If it works just ignore that error, if you don't want to see it anymore you can set swallow_startup_errors as true in your config.. Hi, I already told you yesterday (or the day before) that this anaconda project is not the one that you are using, the anaconda python distribution project page is https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues\nThis is a plugin for Sublime Text 3 editor.. Don't worry :). I am afraid that is a different anaconda project, try here: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues. Wrong repository @jknaus, this is a plugin for ST3 not the Anaconda python distribution, their repository is https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues \nTry there :). Hi,\nthe keystroke for the ( character has meaning in anaconda, it tells anaconda that signatures is ready to be displayed, without the keystroke you will not get signatures always.\nAnyway, did you tried to enable the parameters completion? This will add the parenthesis (and other parameters for you) and signatures will not be displayed as you already have the parameters in your code so you don't need to check for the function signature.\nThis is directly extracted from the configuration file:\njavascript\n    /*\n        If complete_parameters is true, anaconda will add function and class\n        parameters to its completions.\n        If complete_all_parameters is true, it will add all the possible\n        parameters, if it's false, it will add only required parameters\n    */\n    \"complete_parameters\": false,\n    \"complete_all_parameters\": false,. Thanks :). What you mean that it works on vim? Using which plugin?. Are you using an interpreter equal or higher than Python 3.6 as your configured python_interpreter in Anaconda?. Open the ST3 console and write this into it:\npython\nfrom anaconda.anaconda_lib.workers.market import Market\nMarket.get(Market, window.id()).interpreter\nPaste here the result. Sorry, use from Anaconda.anaconda_lib.workers.market import Market. So I understand that /home/qmmp123/develop/online_shop/.venv/bin/python is a python 3.6.2 interpreter right?. I will take a look, maybe our Jedi library is too old and doesn't support this yet.. Actually that is the problem, with our Jedi version:\npython\nfrom jedi import Script\nScript('var: string\\nvar.).completions()\n[]\nWith current Jedi master:\npython\nfrom jedi import Script\nScript('var: string\\nvar.').completions()\n[<Completion: capitalize>,  \n <Completion: casefold>,    \n <Completion: center>,      \n <Completion: count>,       \n <Completion: encode>,      \n <Completion: endswith>,    \n <Completion: expandtabs>,  \n <Completion: find>,        \n <Completion: format>,      \n <Completion: format_map>,  \n <Completion: index>,       \n <Completion: isalnum>,     \n <Completion: isalpha>,     \n <Completion: isdecimal>,   \n <Completion: isdigit>,     \n <Completion: isidentifier>,\n <Completion: islower>,     \n <Completion: isnumeric>,   \n <Completion: isprintable>, \n <Completion: isspace>,     \n <Completion: istitle>,     \n...]\nThe solution will be as simple as update Jedi but that will require a crossover full in deep test in all three platforms to check that nothing else is broken, it will take a bit of time.. Anaconda vendors it's own copy of Jedi as rely in other Jedi installation could cause problems and in that way we have to support only a Jedi version what is way cleaner and easier for us.\nIf you update Jedi by yourself signatures, goto, usages and documentation are gonna break as they introduced a breaking change not long ago and we don't support it yet. Anyway if you still want to update your in anacoda vendored version of Jedi you can totally do it just following this steps:\n\nStop Sublime Text\nMake a copy of Anaconda/anaconda_lib/jedi as backup\nDownload latest Jedi version\nCopy the jedi directory inside the Jedi package root into Anaconda/anaconda_lib/jedi\nCross fingers\nStart Sublime Text\n. You probably broke signatures, goto and usages support right?. No, you just updated your own copy of jedi but that doesn't really solves the issue, I will close it when I update Jedi in anaconda and fix the problems with usages, goto and signatures.. This should work now out of the box with v2.1.19. Are you using a Python 3 interpreter as your configured python_interpreter for anaconda?. No problem \ud83d\udc4d . There are no false positives going on in here, if you want Python3 syntax linting then configure a Python 3 interpreter.\n\nhttp://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/\n. I am afraid that I can't help you if you don't follow the New Issue template and add all the logs that we ask for, with the information that you provided I can't do nothing but guess, please, provide your JsonServer logs and your console logs.\nAlso add list of your in use plugins (others than anaconda).. I need your JsonServer logs probably it is crashing.. Yeah, your JsonServer is crashing for some reason but we don't get the traceback in the logs so you are gonna need to start it in Debug mode. This is the explanation of how to do it (extracted directly from the config file).\n```javascript\n/*\n        Debug Mode:\n    If you need to debug the jsonserver.py service for any reason, you\n    can configure the following options to make the plugin to connect\n    always to the same port in your local machine.\n\n    Procedure:\n\n        1. Set the debug_mode as true\n        2. Set the debug_port to your desired port\n        3. Close Sublime Text 3\n        4. cd to your Packages/Anaconda directory\n        5. Start the jsonserver manually:\n            python -B anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p test 9999 DEBUG\n        6. Start your Sublime Text 3 and\n\n    Then your anaconda plugin will use the configured server, and you will\n    get debug messages in the terminal where you ran it.\n*/\n\"jsonserver_debug\": false,\n\"jsonserver_debug_port\": 9999,\n\n```\nI don't know what is it but I am guessing that is related with you using a Python2 interpreter and using UTF-8 encoded characters in your file system paths and file names.\nPlease, start the server using the same interpreter that you have configured for anaconda and paste here any exception that you get.. Where is the traceback?. There is no tracebacks in the text that you pasted, that is just normal debug information, doesn't looks like there is any crashes or unhandled exceptions but there was something weird going on in your logs as the connection with the JsonServer was being constantly reset.\nThis demonstrates that when you start the JsonServer manually from a terminal (cmd.exe or powershell) everything works as expected so this is why I am guessing this is an environmental issue and probably related with the fact that you make an extensive use of Unicode characters as your computer is set to use Chinese language (that requires 16 bits to accommodate some characters).\nPlease, run this into your ST3 console and paste the results:\npython\nimport sys\nprint(sys.stdin)\n. How is that even possible? O.o\nWhat happens if you don't use print and just write sys.sdtin?. Thats the problem, your encoding for ST3 is not UTF-8 (encoding='cp936' that is Simplified Chinese encoding), when ST3 starts a new process, it does with those encodings, when you start it from the terminal the encoding is UTF-8 and that is why we don't see any crash from the debug.\nTry to set the environment variable (create it if it doesn't exists) PYTHONIOENCODING to utf8 and see if the encoding changes in ST3.. My Chinese is a bit rusty (I don't know any Chinese at all), what that means?. Oh, so you use the same character \u8c22 twice to say thank you, so curious. Thank you for your words, I just try to maintain the plugin for as long as I can. To become a good programmer is just a matter of time, I don't consider myself a \"good programmer\" really I am always learning and improving.\nRegards.. Are you sure that Python process is anaconda's? This is directly extracted from the bottom of your jsonserver logs\n2017-07-27 13:02:51,943: INFO    : client requests: doc\n2017-07-27 13:31:32,067: INFO    : process 4745 does not exists stopping server...\n2017-07-27 13:31:34,059: INFO    : Closing the socket, server will be shutdown now...\nAs you can see, anaconda's jsonserver killed himself after noticing that ST3 wasn't open anymore.... What you describe is not possible on Posix systems as any JsonServer process started by anaconda is tied to the PID of your in execution Sublime Text 3, so even if you kill ST3 and start it in a millisecond, you will have a different PID and the previous JsonServer process will kill himself as it's creator PID is no in the system anymore.\nThe anaconda's JsonServer python process could remain up to 30 seconds in the system before to kill himself.. Can you attach a strace to that process to see what it is doing?. Feel free to open a new issue with more information if you get more information or discover if something is really wrong and what is going on.\nAlso take into account that Anaconda can (and will) start more than one process for different ST3 windows. Sorry but after more than five mins editing, completing, linting and using anaconda features in that file I wasn't able to reproduce the described behavior.\n\nNote: One of the processes is a thread. Can I know which Python modules are you importing into pixie_working? I will try to replicate it in my OSX box later today.. If you could be able to detect on which completion this start to get out of control it would be extremely helpful for me cos I would be able to test it directly against the same version of Jedi that we are vendoring. Your system python is 2.7.11?. @wmorrell can you configure anaconda to use a Python 3 interpreter and see if you can reproduce?. That looks pretty nasty @CrystalRays \nI am really busy but I will try to replicate and go to the bottom of the issue. Which application were you using to record the video btw?. @wmorrell in your case you also have blank lines in the top of the file?. Still can't reproduce it @CrystalRays I used both Python3 and Python 2 but in my case memory is stick to 7Mb of usage and it doesn't move it doesn't matters how much I add or remove empty lines at the top of the file.\nI am afraid that I am gonna need you to run the JsonServer in Debug mode, do you know how to do it?. Just follow this instructions. Just remove the 1024, it will work. When you start the server you have to use the same name for the -p param as the project that you are gonna test with, if you don't use a project, then the name of the folder must be used, if you just opened a file, then you have to use anaconda-<window-id> in your last pasted logs /home/crystalrays/.local/share/anaconda/run/anaconda-2/anaconda.sock  it would be -p anaconda-2 as you can see.. I have no clue, I couldn't reproduce it in any of my Linux boxes (desktop and laptop), I will try to reproduce it on Windows and OSX with your same file.. Hi @sha-red \nTry with: python -B anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p <your_project_or_folder_names> DEBUG. I think I've been able to reproduce it in my OSX box with @CrystalRays file.\nLooks like Jedi gets stalled in a loop on the call to goto_definitions being called by anaconda_server/commands/doc.py:41 what I don't know yet is why.. I am pretty sure this has to be related with IO streaming encoding or environment in some way. I noticed that in the only box that I am able to reproduce this the sys.stdin encoding is set to US-ASCII instead of UTF-8.\nCan you guys check what is the encoding of your sys.stdin in your ST3 console?. I am certain that this issue has to do with the IO encoding not being UTF8, I started ST3 from the command line using PYTHONIOENCODING subl3 but unfortunately it didn't solved the problem. I will try to change the encoding globally and see how that works out.\nAnyway, I would love to go to the bottom of the issue and make a report into the Jedi project so David (or any other contributor can fix it) or try to fix it myself, any help from you guys is really appreciated.. Hi @karolyi, can you tell me which encoding is using your ST3 sys.stdin object?. Do you think you can start the JsonServer in debug mode trough pdb and just break the process as soon as you get the JsonServer stalled using your CPU and memory? We could be able to discover what is going on.\nP.S: I've been trying to do that myself for a while but I am not able to reproduce it when I usepdb to start the process, funny.... I found that the problem is when jedi tries to call the goto_definitions() method when the node being analyzed is a new line character:\nNode(suite, [<Newline: u'\\n'>, Node(simple_stmt, [<ExprStmt: exp = prepare(exp)@148,4>, <Newline: u'\\n'>]), Node(simple_stmt, [<ExprStmt: exp = khcl(exp)@149,4>, <Newline: u'\\n'>]), Node(simple_stmt, [<ReturnStmt: return add(exp)@150,4>, <Newline: u'\\n'>])])\nSadly I still have no idea how to reproduce this just using Jedi (with no jsonserver involvement) so I can not report it on Jedi nor I can try to fix it myself.\nBtw, if it was an infinite recursion, the Python process should eventually stop because the stack would be overflow. Can you please create a new issue for that and edit the comment in here with a link to it? Just to maintain a coherence and track all this easier.. Guys, I made some stupid as a donkey modifications and now I can't reproduce it anymore. Please, remove anaconda from your ST3 using package control, then clone this repo into your Packages and checkout the branch issue_680.\nLet me know if you could reproduce the issue.. I couldn't reproduce it but I fixed it anyway @karolyi . This should be fixed @CrystalRays please, confirm. What this has to do with the OP report? Totally unrelated. In your screenshot Autoformatting failes, buffer not changed can be read in the status bar, you will have probably some logs.. This looks like a regression. I am having a hard time to reproduce this. The thing is this will make ST3 to dynamically reload the Context file giving some kind of log behind in the console,   I understand that this solution will work but I think is way too clever and a bit hacky. Maybe is worth just to wait till the right fix come from the ST3 development team.. Can't reproduce, are you sure that you don't define complete_all_parameters as true at any configuration level?. I will try to reproduce it later today. I could reproduce it, I will take a look but my plate is kind of full right now. @etienned open up the console and write:\npython\nfrom Anaconda.anaconda_lib.helpers import get_settings\nget_settings(view, 'complete_all_parameters')\nWhat do you get?. The weird part is that self.code should already be a utf8 encoded sequence of bytes as it is encoded by the anaconda client before to be sent trough the socket to the JsonServer, I will take a look when I have some spare time.. No, you don't have to guess the errors, that would be beyond stupid. Actually you have four ways to know about the errors.\n\nMethod 1: Just select the offending line and an error description will appear in the status bar\nMethod 2: Use the Command Palette to execute: Anaconda: Show error list\nMethod 3: Set the anaconda_linter_show_errors_on_save option to true in the config\nMethod 4: Set the anaconda_linter_phantoms option to true to see errors inline\n\nAs you can see, you don't have to guess too much, have you?. Then this is a feature request and not an issue, not a support request, honestly I think there are already more than enough ways to get information about the linting problems, apart from that, new features are closed till I release Golconda and I can not use the already low spare time that I have implementing and supporting new features.\nSaid that, I will accept a PR implementing this (always than the person that implements it commit to maintain it as well).. This should be fixed in v2.1.21. Yeah, looks like continuation is not a valid base 10 integer\nP.S: I am pretty sick of autopep8, since some releases they break continuation report messages from PyCodeStyle, this is probably related with that.. Then you probably don't get any message information in the linter for the following error codes:\n- E124\n- E128\n- E123\n- E122\n- E127\n- E131\n- E126\n- E121. This should be working again, please, confirm and close.. Thanks for your report but we are gonna need a bit more of information in order to even start looking into a \"possible memory leak\" just using the title of this issue...\nCan you please follow the template and provide the required information?\nThank You.. Hi guys,\nThat is probably caused by a Jedi library update I need to know if you are using Python2 or Python3 as your configured anaconda interpreter. By the way, I've been testing a branch with a new update to Jedi that seems to solve the problems in the previous update, I did not had any problem so far so I will probably push that into our next version today or tomorrow.\nI will give you a ping so you can update and test it.. I released new version v2.1.21, let me know if yo still experience problems with it. This should be fixed, feel free to reopen again if needed.. Hey @karolyi \nI think is time to involve the Jedi developers into this, it would be probably useful to create a new ticket in the Jedi github project giving the same information that you shared here today, David will be a much better fit to jump into this problem as my knowledge about Jedi internals is not good enough, apart from that I am in the middle of moving house so I have very few to none time at all, I don't even have a computer in the new house yet.\nIf you link the issue on Jedi to here I will follow up and I will be probably able to give you and David a hand answering any question while I am at office.. The tests stuff was a feature introduced by some anaconda user and has been improved and/or fixed by some other users over the time, I have never been interested on it as I run my tests from the terminal, I mean that I am not willing to spend any time in add this feature (as this is a feature) but I will totally accept PR's implementing it and I will give any information to anyone willing to implement it to help him/her in the task.. Why is the tasklist process still running? Can you try to run tasklist from a CMD.exe or Powershell to see if it hangs?. tasklist.exe is a terminal/console application for windows that show you a list of your running processes. The process is not a service or daemon so is like if you use cd or dir it shouldn't be shown in your active processes as it will just return the list of processes and die.\nAnaconda does not spam anything, it just calls that windows command to know if ST3 is still running in your system or not, I asked you if you could run tasklist from your terminal to see how it behaves and you answered with more images that are useless, if you are not willing to follow simple instructions and give me results I am afraid that I can not give you any support.. You should not see any tasklist process as the process should return as soon as it runs (just as when you run it in the terminal). First of all, lets determine things in here because I am not a Windows user and I have no access to any Windows machine right now. Which program are you using to see your running processes and what it means that the background is red?\nIf you run tasklist yourself, do you see a lot of other tasklist processes running as well?. But that is just a regular process operation, the process does not exists anymore in your system and is not using any resources, you are just concerned because you have a task manager that caches the execution of processes for 10 minutes.\nAnaconda fires up a tasklist process every 5 seconds precisely to don't usu any resources from your system in case that the ST3 editor is closed, is 5 seconds because we want to stop the Python server as soon as we can to don't waste resources in your machine.\nYou have three options:\n1) Add tasklist to any kind of ignore filter in your tasks monitor application \n2) Ignore (mentally) all the tasklist garbage that you see in red (and I repeat those are not real processes in your system as the process was long gone)\n3) You edit the jsonserver.py file in every release yourself and add whatever delay you consider for the processes monitor \nI am afraid that this is not an issue for any other user in the world so I am closing this. . Hi, I think you are making the wrong questions here. The question should be why your computer is not able to resolve localhost? \nlocalhost is being used universally everywhere because rely in a hardcoded IP is plainly wrong. 127.0.0.1 can work for you but doesn't necessarily have to work for other people, like for example people using IPv6 exclusively.\nThe localhost hostname is a IETF standard (RFC 6761) and a reliable way to resolve your loopback interface (that bypasses any network hardware and it's overheads). The solution to your problem must be to make your computer to resolve localhost as that is the right thing to do.\nTry to put this in your /etc/hosts file:\n127.0.0.1    localhost\n::1          localhost. I am confused, why are you adding a feature that already exists?\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/Default.sublime-commands#L3-L8\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/commands/disable_linting.py\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/commands/enable_linting.py. I think is better if you just create a plugin in your userspace (a directory in your Packages/User) with the command file and the key bindings that you want for this, it will work and is just what you want.. Yeah that's true then what do you think of moving it to the PersistentList itself into the append method (just call the append method in the super class if the element is not in the list already) and make 'DISABLED_BUFFERS  a set?. Environment variables will work again since v2.1.22. Duplicated of https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/692\nPlease, comment in there. It will be also useful to start anaconda in Debug mode https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/Anaconda.sublime-settings#L60-L81. Take a look to: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda#auto-complete-for-import-behaves-badly. It has to work, I can't reproduce it\n\n. You have to configure anaconda to use a Python 3 interpreter if you want to use Python 3 syntax\n\n. Woopsie, looks like I totally broke it, give me some mins guys.. Fixed on v2.1.23\nBy the way, @sametmax, the project has unit tests, it also has a travis hook that runs on each push but that unit tests are just for the JsonServer part, add unit testing for anything that is related with the ST3 embedded interpreter is horribly complex and time consuming there had been many attempts from part of the ST3 plugins development community to create a package to make the task easier but it is still a pain  in the bottom so we just don't have unit tests for client side code (client side is any code that is executed by the ST3 embedded python interpreter).\nSaid that, PRs are welcome.. Closing this @mladimir feel free to open another one if you find any issues.. You have to configure anaconda to use a Python 3 interpreter\nhttp://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/. Hi, I noticed that myself yesterday and already fixed it but is not yet released, anyway, it doesn't really affects the plugin normal operations (apart from the annoying message in the console).\nIs curious that at some point there is no Window object but obviously the Window entity exists (at least in the C++ scope).. The fix for this was released yesterday. You have to configure your anaconda installation to use a Python3 interpreter\nhttp://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/. Compare Anaconda and BPython is like compare apples and oranges, for a start, anaconda relies on Jedi Python Autocompletion library while BPython implements it's own code analyzer, anaconda is based in an asynchronous client - server architecture (with it's delays, timeouts, latency  and problems) while BPython is a monolithic piece of software.\nBasically, Anaconda can complete or analyze anything that Jedi can (with your configured anaconda python interpreter) and it doesn't have to match with what BPython or IPythoin or PyCharm can analyze or complete. . Hi @mg979, just one comment\nDid you tried the feature with all the Python syntax highlight available? If not, please do it.. After you address the three comments I have no problem to merge this.. Sorry, I did not click the Start Review button, you should be able to see them now. I will merge this into the next release (probably this evening). \nThank you for your contribution.. You can see how anaconda handles that looking into the listeners directory in the project root. By default features like that I like them to be disabled. . Anaconda uses Jedi so anaconda supports anything that Jedi supports\nhttps://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/blob/master/docs/docs/features.rst#general-features. You have to configure a Python3 interpreter. http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/. Hi @hyperknot \nYou just need to hook it into this function that is used to get anaconda settings https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/anaconda_lib/helpers.py#L197-L261. This is just querying the ST3 settings object (or the view.settings object) that is just a custom dictionary so the access should be O(1), I don't really see the problem here.\n. Anaconda does't likes to do this thing, is more a matter of anaconda has to do this thing, otherwise changes made to the .anaconda hook file will be silently ignored.\nWhat is your suggestion? . @jamesandres do you have an .anaconda config file in your working path?. Then how do you explain the CPU improvement? If you don't have a .anconda file in your path, there is no JSON decoding. Let's say that the average user works into an average of five deep levels in the path (and I am being generous here), examples:\n/Users/name/Projects/Python/ProjectName\n/home/name/development/whatever/project_name\nC:\\\\Users\\\\name\\\\Documents\\\\Programming\\\\ProjectName\nLook for the .anaconda file in a loop of N = 5 average is not the cause of any CPU usage and less taking into account that after the first look, the operating system buffering enters into play.\nCan we add lot of extra complexity into this in order to win probably some milliseconds (if any)? Yes\nWorth the effort? I am not sure. The problem with caching it is that you have to restart ST3 every time that a modification is made to the file, and that is non acceptable. A solution in the middle way (like check is the file last modification time is newer than the time that we read it in order to load it) I could be open to accept.. Sorry @hyperknot I didn't read the code deeply, feel free to clean the pipfile parts and write a new comment or mark me as reviewer when done.. If the interpreter configuration gets cached, how is the plugin gonna stop the running JsonServer and start a\\ new one for the configured interpreter if the user changes it? This will force users to reopen their ST3 in order to update interpreter or path related options. \nMaybe we should use the add_on_change method from the Settings class https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html#sublime.Settings\nApart from that, I am pretty sure that we could be able to hook into pipenv as a library and don't use subprocess in order to check the path. Let me think about this for a while.. You can open another project during the same session, I do it all the time. Sorry for don't answer this earlier, I am very very very busy, life has this bad habit of get into things. I didn't merged this because I already fixed in my \"in working\" branch, thanks for the contrib anyway.. All mypy  support needs to be updated.. This is not the anaconda Python distribution, just looking at the README.md makes it more than clear, the issues tracker that you are looking for is https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues. Maybe there is some change in how Jedi resolves the symbols, this happens always or just with some kind of symbol? (like defined by you, part of standard library, 3rd party libraries, etc). After look into this for a while, looks like Jedi is resolving to those locations itself. Should be fixed on v2.1.27. I had to rollback so 2.1.28 is equivalent to 2.1.26. This project is not the anaconda python distribution project, you want to write your ticket in https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues instead. Fixed, pending release. This can happen for two different things\n1) Because your configured python interpreter/environment for anaconda differs from the one were those libraries are installed, and Jedi can't see them\n2) Because anaconda's JsonServer crashed and anaconda is not really working \nThat is why we ask for logs versions and other information that you are not offering in your report. We need more information in order to help you.. When you created the ticket, you had to remove a predefined template, in that template is all the required information (you can find the template here https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)\nST3 console log can be access just showing the ST3 console.\nAnaconda version can be check in several ways, one is opening the ST3 console and writing:\npython\nfrom Anaconda.version import version; print(version);.

I have no idea what you are speaking about, this project is a plugin for Sublime Text 3 it had noting to do with your interpreter.. Anything related with caching results for the autocompletion is out of the scope of Anaconda plugin. In fact, that is controlled by Jedi itself. If you have some question about that is much better that you make it in the Jedi Github Project instead. . As far as I know it should matter not to which keys do you map the command . I thought I answered this ticket, seems like I did not. \nJedi is known to have problems parsing/completing Numpy that is probably the cause.\n\nBy the way, pts. is not an statement, what you meant with statements?. Hi. Anaconda should give you possible completions after you use the . character to access an object properties but it could fail for a couple of reasons.\nA) Jedi (one of the libraries that anaconda uses under the hood) is not able to resolve the symbol returning no results so anaconda does not shows anything\nB) For some reason anaconda JsonServer is failing/crashing in the background\nThe first time that anaconda tryes to do something in a huge library it takes a while as Jedi needs to parse the library and resolve all it's symbols, after that a cache is created, to improve times on that you should improve Jedi itself.\nRegards.. When you get the Project or interpreter switch detected is because the python_interpreter in your configuration (per project, per user or global) is not the same than the one that is currently being used by the anaconda's JsonServer so anaconda kills that JsonServer and starts a new one with the new interpreter.\nTo be able to see which interpreters are in play in your system for a given view (buffer) at any time just open the Sublime Text 3 console and write:\n```python\nfrom Anaconda.anaconda_lib.helpers import get_settings\nfrom Anaconda.anaconda_lib.workers.market import Market\nprint('Configured Interpreter: {}'.format(get_settings(view, 'python_interpreter')))\nprint('In use Interpreter for view {}: {}'.format(view.file_name(), Market.get(Market, window.id()).interpreter.raw_interpreter))\n``. The.raw_interpreterproperty of theWorker.interpreterobject is set on initialization only and it gets initialized if there is a change in thepython_interpreterconfiguration option, as it only gets set after readingpython_interpreterand with the value of thepython_interpreter`, this is probably some corner case with windows (and probably the anaconda python distribution) as I don't use Windows at all and could not test the plugin on Windows as deep as in other platforms.\nTo get rid of the annoyance just set the auto_project_switch property in your config to false. Do you have any new log?. Try with this python_interpreter path:\n\"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\cschweiger\\\\Projects\\\\envs\\\\tes\\\\python.exe\"\nUse that path also for the shell_cmd in the build configuration. Please, refer to this https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/631. No worries.. The problem is not in the autocompletion but in the linting, looks like PyLint is failing. PyLint is not \"officially\" part of anaconda supported linters, anyway, I will look into it as soon as I can.. You can find information about how to personalize the linting options on the wiki and in the documentation web site ( you can find the link to the documentation in the very top of the GitHub project home page ).. This is before defining table:\n\nThis is after defining table:\n\nProbably you did not configured your anaconda's python interpreter right, refer to http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/\n. When you use a huge package like tensorflow or numpy for first time, anaconda has to analyze it and that takes time, after that, everythign should be cached and use the package will be fast.. Use the absolute path to your $VIRTUAL_ENV instead of the shell variable.. Currently anaconda does not expand environment variables from your shell, just from Sublime project vars, this is something that I would like to change in the future when I can take the development of the pluign back as I have a very limited spare time on my hands since a while now.. It looks good to me, my only concern is the availability of the ctypes.windll.kernel32 in all the installations.. Python 2.6\nI will merge tomorrow, thanks.. What is the content of your /etc/hosts file?. Looks like ST3 is reconnecting to the anaconda server, anaconda is a server-client architecture that is why I am asking about your hosts file.\nI am not sure, there is nothing in the logs except the multiple re-connections that could happen because inactivity reached max time.. You have to add that path as your python_interpreter\nMore info: https://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/. Just do ps aux | grep anaconda  you will see which python interpreter is being used in the output. You can add whatever shortcuts to your own configuration as you wish, the name of the functions to call can be found in https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/Default.sublime-commands. I don't know what you are speaking about. Hi, no it has not, it is just marked as private while I am happy with the code quality. I've been working these days in the ST3 library https://github.com/DamnWidget/libconda and I am about to start the ST3 plugin that will render this one obsolete.\nSadly I don't have all the time that I would like I am very busy during the week and very tired during weekends but I will get there eventually.\nThanks for asking btw.. Yeah, I know what you mean. I am currently working in the new plugin, I will make sure to add it on that one but I don't think I am gonna add new features to anaconda plugin myself, if you can wait great, if you can not, I accept PRs :D. I don't understand what you mean with If Anaconda disabled do you mean with the plugin disabled or just with the autoformat_ignore?\nWhat happens if you do execute the following in the terminal from the Packages/Anacondadirectory?\nbash\npython anaconda_lib/autopep/autopep8_lib/autopep8.py --ignore=W191 SashaAnaconda.py. Sorry for the really late response, I thought I had answered this last comment but sorts out that I did not (pretty busy, going crazy actually). \nLooks like there is some kind of problem in autopep8 library (that we use to provide that feature). There is not much that I could do myself in order to fix it but there are some things that you can try out.\nDownload the latest autopep8 version and use it from the command like before and observe the behavior of the tool, if the behavior is what you are expecting, come back here and request a library update, if it is the same behavior that you reported, I suggest you to open a ticket in the autopep8 project itself.. Hi, that looks like a Jedi problem, probably @davidhalter can give you more insights than I do. I don't, it gets activated when anaconda's DEBUG mode is enabled. You can try to open this issue in the Anaconda Python distribution project and not in the Anaconda Sublime Text 3 plugin (that is this repo).\nJust follow this link: https://github.com/conda/conda. There are many changes in Jedi API, update to >=0.12.0 requires rewriting of some features and tests . Please, give a try to the branch jedi_0_12 if there are no major issues (all the tests are passing in several Python versions so far) I will make an update.\nBy the way, Python 2.6 support has been dropped on that branch as a side effect of updating Jedi to 0.12.0. Jedi has been updated to 0.12 in abaconda v2.1.27. Being honest, I have no clue but that is expected as this project has no relation with the anaconda python distribution from continuum .\nYou can try to ask that same question in the right project: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues\nThey will probably not be clueless about what you are asking in there.. You can't specify the pylint path, anaconda just uses the pylint executable that is in your environment PATH. This has been fixed in v2.1.27. As the error says, if anaconda works well for you, set the swallow_startup_errors to true so you will not be bothered about this on startup. If your anaconda installation does not work, come back and give us more details about what does not works.. This is a Jedi problem, we are testing a new Jedi version, if you want, you can clone this repository into your Packages/ directory (after remove Anaconda package using the Command Palette) and checkout the jedi_0_12 branch if you want to check if new version of Jedi solved this problem. \nIf it didn't I recommend you to open a new ticket in Jedi Github repository directly.. This should be solved as per anaconda v2.1.27. This could create some performance impact on projects with high deep directory structure as anaconda tries to find the file in the project directory or in any of it's parents, this change would do the same but using the directory where the file resides, and this is performed for every action.\nP.S: sorry for the late answer. If you add a configuration option to enable this new approach instead of the one already on the plugin (and set it as disabled by default) I will merge it with no further considerations. You could call the option allow_multiple_anaconda_config_files or whatever you think is better.. You need to provide some information. To what are you trying go to? Is working for me. Same comment, it works for me, if you don't give more information, like for example which modules are you trying to go to, which version of python are you using, which OS etc is nothing that I can do. I just rollback to v2.1.26 in latest version, there is a branch jedi_0_12 that can be test by anyone that has time and want to do it. New version v2.1.28 is a v2.1.27 rollback to v2.1.26 . Wow, sloppy, \nFixed, thanks. I never used WSL myself but I believe you should just remove all the\nbash.exe stuff and just leave the path to the python interpreter, try and\nshare the results.\nOn Mon, Jul 16, 2018, 23:09 skjbulcher notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIs there a way to use WSL's python when configuring the python_enterpreter\noption?

Maybe a BAT file (or whatever is used nowadays in Windows) would work? Honestly I don't know, I don't use Windows.. This should be solved via PR. No relation between anaconda and side bar at all.. The question here is why your sublime text binary is not forking/cloning and running as a daemon? Sublime Text is supposed to don't stay running in foreground on your terminal.\n\nP.S: all that output is there for debugging and users are not supposed to get it cos Sublime Text does not stays running in the terminal, I don't know why it just stays there in you case, you might want to check on Fedora/CentOS forums.. Looks like I forgot to make a new release with this change. The project needs a maintainer urgently, I do not program in Python nor use Sublime Text 3 anymore and honestly I have less and less time to spend (family responsibilities and work mainly) in FOSS projects.. It should. unless you have configured otherwise. Hi, Anaconda does not integrates with PDB at any level, those boxes where just regular linting warnings from the PEP8 linter.\nIf you don't want anaconda to lint your code, you can completely disable linting in the configuration file setting it to false.. Good :+1: .

The tests are failing due Travis not being able to compile mypyfor Python 3.3, I am taking a look before merge this.. That is the linter, if you don't want the linter to analyze your code disable it setting anaconda_linting to false on your anaconda settings.. The default value here should be pep8.MAX_LINE_LENGTH that should be 79, then you can just remove the default value in the pep8_check method signature\n. I think we can just pass a default value from the get_settings call in sublime.py and remove the default value here to make the method signature shorter, I think we can safely remove the None value for the ignore parameter as well.\n. Some workaround has to be done here. Anaconda can be installed as \"Anaconda\" (mostly when it is installed using Package Control) and \"anaconda\", this ico_path should be more dynamic that it is now. By the way, I suggest to use the operating system agnonstic method os.path.join to build any type of path inside anaconda.\n\nYou can always use something like:\n    ico_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../../gutter_mark_themes/{theme}-{type}.png')\n. I really prefer the key=value format here instead of the directory unpacking, the former is more readable\n. What about this:\nplugin_path = os.path.dirname(__file__).rsplit('/', 3)[1]\nico_path = os.path.join('Packages', plugin_path, 'gutter_mark_themes', '{theme}-{type}.png')\n. this line shouldn't use os.path.join it should be just:\ndirname = view.window().folders()[0]\n. this line comment should be in line 126 as it breaks PEP8 80 lines length that anaconda code follows\n. Do we need those methods?\n. We don't concatenate strings as they are expensive operations in Python, please, use the format method of the string object like '{0}($0)'.format(comp.name)\n. I know this makes sense but now I can't remember why this was part of the outer scope\n. Let's move this global to the top of the function\n. I think this one should be more like:\nSet the value of the python_interpreter to a valid Python interpreter path like for example /usr/local/bin/python3.4\n. I will prefer change this to\npython\nif os.path.exists(environfile) and os.path.isfile(environfile):\n. Please, remove all those commented lines, no one would care about the old approach but add a comment saying that we are forced to use a non Pythonic import approach here as the incomplete module future.moves.html from PyCharmers breaks the doc.py logic so we are forced to use these conditionals.\n. I don't think we need this variable to store to which line we should jump next, what we need is to check if lines_list is empty and return lines.pop() if it is empty\n. With no next_change we don't need this cast as the index is used only once in the comprehension list\n. We don't really need all this code block at all, the only thing that we need is define lines_list in line 65 just before the conditional, like:\n``` python\nif not len(lines):\n    return None\nlines_list = []\nif cur_line and list(lines)[-1] > cur_line:\n```\n. We can achieve the same result and have a much more cleaner code just with a one line conditional return\npython\nreturn lines_list[0] if len(lines_list) > 0 else lines.pop()\n. Yeah simpler and confusing as well.\nI normally write a Python module for anaconda and then two years after that I have to come back to add new functionality or to fix a bug, in all that time I don't open the file (if is not part of the core) even once so when I come back I like to be able to read the code and totally understand what is doing.\nThat is why I always follow the Python zen \"explicit is better than implicit\" and the mantra \"readability matters\", I dislike \"implicit boolean\" conversions and I try to avoid them not only in Python but in any language that I write code in.\nIf we use something like return lines_list[0] if lines_list else lines.pop() we are making and implicit boolean conversion for a type that should never be interpreted as a boolean, that is why the explicit check len(lines_list) > 0 give us information about what the type is and what we meant with the check. What we want to check is if the variable has no elements, that is quite different to check if the variable is True.\nHere and as I also try to use meaningful variable names it doesn't matter too much cos there is list word in the name of the variable, but, in any case, I prefer to be explicit (explicit is not the same as verbose) and the whole anaconda code is written with those concepts in mind.\n. lines is a different variable than lines_list and it can not be empty at this point in the code\n. What happens if lines is empty? I guess it should not be empty but add some conditional just in case\n. You must use the get_settings helper function defined in anaconda_lib.helpers as it will take care of look for settings in other locations that must override global configurations (like project configuration). An example of usage is as follows:\npython\nif get_settings('complete_all_parameters', False):\n    self.view.run_command('anaconda_complete_funcargs')\n    ...\n. Refer to comment above. I would prefer if you check that meta.function-call or meta.function_call is in the scope instead of remove the call part as we don't want this to get fired in any other place.. ",

    "dan-blanchard": "I would love to see this take over for the seemingly deceased Pylinter project that used pylint instead of pyflakes. pylint is just much much more thorough. I've been considering forking Pylinter (because they won't merge the pull request that makes it work with ST3), but pylint integration for anaconda would mean I don't have to do that. :)\n. It was a pain to get configured properly initially, but it was the only linter for ST2 that supported using the system Python install for a while, which made it very handy for doing development in Python 3 on ST2.\n. That sounds great. Thanks!\n. Works great for me. Thanks for adding it!\n. Sorry about the delay, but where are the jedi logs stored?\n.

I should also mention that this was happening before I switched to using pylint as well.\n. That's weird, my comment with my configuration disappeared. It looked like it it double-posted so I deleted one of them, but it took both.\nAnyway, I was running:\nOS: Ubuntu 13.04\nST3: 3052\nPython: 3.3.1\nPlugins: Anaconda, Case Conversion, FindKeyConflicts, Git, INI, LaTeXTools, Modific, Package Control, Python Nose Testing Snippets, Python PEP8 Autoformat, Restructured Text (RST) Snippets, Unittest (python), Wrap Plus\nToday I've since upgrade to 3053, removed FindKeyConflicts, and switched from Git to SublimeGit.\n. I should also mention that with my current configuration, there aren't as many processes (but I haven't saved and triggered as many runs of pylint yet), but the jedi log still has a bunch of those tuple unpacking errors and restarting the json server.\n. $ pylint --version\npylint 1.0.0, \nastroid 1.0.0, common 0.60.0\nPython 3.3.1 (default, Apr 17 2013, 22:30:32) \n[GCC 4.7.3]\n. It runs fine. Oh yeah, I should also have mentioned that things do usually end up highlighting fine in ST3 as well, the processes just kept spawning.\n. Hmm... weird. I thought maybe things had righted themselves, but it just started happening again. Same error messages in the log. Would running things in debug mode help? I seem to recall there being a setting in the configuration file for that. As it stands right now, I just have to close ST every few hours to clear out the extra processes.\n. Actually, I just got a different error in the console after I tried to save to retrigger a linting:\n```\nRegistering handler with address ('localhost', 55012)\nUnhandled exception in poll, restarting the poll request\nError trying to decode value: Expected value in (data):1:1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 273, in inner_loop\n    poll()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 257, in poll\n    handler.recv()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 174, in recv\n    self.process_message()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_client/jsonclient.py\", line 58, in process_message\n    data = sublime.decode_value(message.decode('utf8'))\n  File \"/opt/sublime_text/sublime.py\", line 145, in decode_value\n    raise ValueError(err)\nValueError: Error trying to decode value: Expected value in (data):1:1\nException in thread Thread-12:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 273, in inner_loop\n    poll()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 257, in poll\n    handler.recv()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 174, in recv\n    self.process_message()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_client/jsonclient.py\", line 58, in process_message\n    data = sublime.decode_value(message.decode('utf8'))\n  File \"/opt/sublime_text/sublime.py\", line 145, in decode_value\n    raise ValueError(err)\nValueError: Error trying to decode value: Expected value in (data):1:1\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"X/threading.py\", line 639, in _bootstrap_inner\n  File \"X/threading.py\", line 596, in run\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 282, in inner_loop\n    for handler in IOHandlers()._handler_pool.values():\nRuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration\nUnhandled exception in poll, restarting the poll request\nError trying to decode value: Expected ':' in (data):1:4099\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 273, in inner_loop\n    poll()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 257, in poll\n    handler.recv()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 174, in recv\n    self.process_message()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_client/jsonclient.py\", line 58, in process_message\n    data = sublime.decode_value(message.decode('utf8'))\n  File \"/opt/sublime_text/sublime.py\", line 145, in decode_value\n    raise ValueError(err)\nValueError: Error trying to decode value: Expected ':' in (data):1:4099\nException in thread Thread-2:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 273, in inner_loop\n    poll()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 257, in poll\n    handler.recv()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 174, in recv\n    self.process_message()\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_client/jsonclient.py\", line 58, in process_message\n    data = sublime.decode_value(message.decode('utf8'))\n  File \"/opt/sublime_text/sublime.py\", line 145, in decode_value\n    raise ValueError(err)\nValueError: Error trying to decode value: Expected ':' in (data):1:4099\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"X/threading.py\", line 639, in _bootstrap_inner\n  File \"X/threading.py\", line 596, in run\n  File \"/home/dblanchard/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/asynconda/ioloop.py\", line 282, in inner_loop\n    for handler in IOHandlers()._handler_pool.values():\nRuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration\nRegistering handler with address ('localhost', 57690)\nWriting file /home/dblanchard/Dropbox/Documents/ETS/skll/skll/learner.py with encoding UTF-8 (atomic)\n```\n.

I'm using Build 3061 (x86) on Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter.\nI use many plugins and I wondered for months what causes the constant memory \"drain\".\nToday I decided to take (at least) a look, so I've disabled a few plugins (the bigger ones) to see if it's more a ST issue or really a plugin one.\nI've disabled four at the beginning (Anaconda, Trailing Spaces, Bracket Highlighter and Vintagous) and watched the plugin_host.exe in the taskmanager closely. Memory consumption wasn't increasing any more...\nFiring up ST leads to about ~16MB for this process. Now I've reenabled the other three one by one to see if the memory consumption begins to grow. Nope, still staying at 16,9Mb, even after 10 minutes.\nBut reenabling Anaconda let's the plugin_host begin to grow. Not every second but about every 12 seconds the process claims 300Kb more. It never stops as long Anaconda is running. So even if I don't use ST at all (but it's running in the background) the plugin_host process will consume more and more memory. It easily reaches 2GB after 24 hours.\nThe curious thing... This happens even if there are only 3 open files (and all of them are .txt). No .php, nothing else in that direction...\nI'll deliver as much information as I can if you like to describe how I get them (under Windows) :)\nRegards,\nHighend\n. Hi @DamnWidget \n- Under Windows all plugins are encapsulated in the plugin_host process and because there are only .txt files no python.exe process is running / started.\n- I've downloaded a fresh 3061 x86 portable version and used it only with Anaconda (ofc latest commit), no configurations were made so far -> Default settings ST + Anaconda.\n- There is no jedi folder inside the %APPDATA% one ;(\n  Do I have to enable the debug option for that?\n- There are no further entries in the ST3 console log after initally loading the the plugins\nLast lines\nreloading plugin Anaconda.anaconda\nloaded 837 snippets\nPersisten list does not exists, skiping load...\nplugins loaded\nThe \"Persisten list\" is the only one that belongs to Anaconda that looks \"unusual\". I get the same message on my normal installation, too.\nRegards\n. Yepp, that's what I wanted to say with the second list item :)\nSo there is definitely a memory \"leak\" inside Anaconda even if it's only present under a MS Windows system. Btw, whenever Anaconda allocates a new ~300KB block the process (plugin_host) activity jumps from 0,0% to 0,4-0,7%. It's doing something but I don't know what ;)\nTime for bed now, I'll answer any new questions in about 8 hours.\n. I have absolutely the same behavior like cloudysapa.\n256kb / ~10 seconds\nOnly ST3, only Anaconda, no Package Control or any other additional addons.\nST3 has no open buffers, TaskManager in front of ST3 (no other apps are running).\n\nST3 3061 x86 portable\nMy main OS: Windows Server 2012 R2 (x64, de-DE)\nI've now tested it in a virtual machine: Windows 7 Enterprise, x86 de-DE\nto be sure it's not some kind of problem between a 64-bit OS and the 32-bit application.\nIt's doing absolutely the same (plugin_host.exe is growing without any files open or any other plugins (apart from Anaconda) installed)\nI guess it wouldn't help if I record a video of it, right?\n. Whenever there is an update, I'll be there to report if it changes anything...\nRegards,\nHighend\n. 8). You're right...\nAbout 20 MB on my system but I got the point. Will you forward the bug to jps?\n. The latest commit fixes the memory leak for me as well :)\nThanks a lot, Oscar!\n. ",
    "daniele-niero": "Hi,\nWith the latest code Sublime 3 seems simply to lock and then crash without reporting anything to the console.\nThe last thing I have is a message that I believe is coming from jedi:\n\"number of files to index exceeds sanity limit, bailing out\"\nAnyway I haven't try to change the firewall settings because I don't have the permission in the office to do it. Hopefully somebody from IT will help me and then we can let you know the outcome.\nThanks.\n. Hi,\nThe It guys said the firewall is not in use. Wee have McCAfe but they check it and they were quite positive that it wasn't causing any trouble to this plugin... :(\n. Hi @DamnWidget \nFirst of all thanks for your help, I really appreciate it.\nI tried to run the php server as you told me and I got this error:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"anaconda_server\\jsonserver.py\", line 34, in \n    from linting import linter\n  File \"anaconda_server../linting\\linter.py\", line 28, in \n    from functools import cmp_to_key\nImportError: cannot import name cmp_to_key\nI guess this is because I have python 2.6 installed and unfortunately I cannot use any other version. This because I have to work with a 3D animation package called Maya, and it supports only python 2.6 (actually its own version of python 2.6)\nMoreover I have tried to reinstall Anaconda on my Sublime Text 3 and now it runs.\nWell, at least we can see some errors now :)\nI hope they ring a bell to you.\nCheers,\n    Dan\n. Ok, it is definetely python 2.6\nI tried to install python 2.7 and use that instead and everything works (excellently, by the way).\nObviously this can be misleading in my case, because Anaconda will show my documentation and suggestions for a version of python I'm not really using... Do you think it is reasonable to ask for full python 2.6 support?\nThanks\n.

I'll keep an eye on it, but I'm quite sure everything is in order, after all, scripts and tools are working just fine.\nunless... is the autocomplete tool importing everything in a specific path, no matter what?\nI have the same library compiled for python 2.6 and 2.7 in the same folder, like this:\nmy_module\n    -  init .py\n    - _my_module26.pyd\n    - _my_module27.pyd\nWhen I import my_module, the  init .py file read the version of python I'm running and accordingly returns all there is inside the correct .pyd wrapped library...\nMaybe is this that confuses the json server?\nIs there a way to tell Anaconda to ignore a module all together? In the example above I could tell Anaconda to ignore my_module and everything in it.\n. Fair enough, I will try to open the ticket on Jedi as soon as I can.\nThanks anyway,\n    Cheers\n. ",

I had to kill it and didn't have a chance to collect more details. I restarted ST3 and the problem happened again, but I could remove the package and close ST3 before all my CPU/RAM was all eaten up. ST3 is running perfectly now; I just wish I could be enjoying the Anaconda features. :(\nRunning ST3 (3052) on my Kubuntu 13.04 64bit machine (Intel Core i5, 4GB RAM - if that matters).\nThank you.\n. Hi, @DamnWidget. I'm happy to come with good news: I figured out how to reproduce this issue: simply start ST3 without any open files. When you open ST3 with already open files in it, Anaconda works just fine and fast. :D\n. @DamnWidget Thanks for your work, but now you got me curious. I noticed that the memory leak was developing itself without a limit until I killed the process. But if you say you didn't notice it since you have a great hardware, either A) it has a limit, which I'm curious to know about or B) you didn't have a chance to open ST3 with no files already open, so it could happen to you.\nI bet on B. :-)\n. There's quite some time I don't see this problem. I guess it's dead. Thanks, @DamnWidget :D\n. ",
    "chidniu": "Hi,\nfor me Anaconda does not seem to be able to import the things from the virtualenv.

I can see that the right python.exe is started by the Sublime Text, but it doesn't work nevertheless.\n. Both packages I desperately tried to get working (PySide and SleekXMPP) install themselves in .egg s in site-packages. I realized that the other ones (who install themselves as an .egg-info and a package folder) work fine. So a workaround is to split the contents of the egg into the package folders and an .egg-info. Is there a \"clean\" solution to this?\n. My interpreter can see the eggs but Anaconda/Jedi can't. For now I worked around it by changing the packages manually (extracting the .egg). Then it works just as it does in your screenshot. Most probably a Windows-specific problem.\nI haven't tried your PySide plugin yet, but I'll give it a look.\nThanks and best regards.\n. Is there maybe some way to detect when another plugin changes the gutter icons? Then Anaconda could change the lines which have been overwritten back.\n. ",

In terminal I set PYTHONPATH on order to access PySide, how can I do a similar thing in ST3?\n. this didn't help. is .pythonstartup exclusive to ST3 or any python interpreter will load it up?\n. adding the 'export' helps when launching the python from terminal however sys.path doesn't seem to have '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages'\nFrom ST3 Console, I get this:\n``` python\n\n\n\nimport sys\nsys.path\n['/Volumes/Home/hamid/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/GoSublime',\n '/Volumes/Home/hamid/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib/autopep/autopep8_lib/./',\n'/Volumes/Home/hamid/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib/autopep/../linting',\n'/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/MacOS',\n'/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/MacOS/python3.3.zip',\n'/Volumes/Home/hamid/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages']\n```\n\n\n\nAnd I changed the python interpreter in Anaconda.sublime-settings:\n\"python_interpreter\": \"/usr/bin/python\",\n. no, I couldn't. it is (my) mac since I verified that the plugin works with PySide on Ubuntu.\nIs it possible to add a PYTHONPATH and/or env setting to Anaconda's setting file to force it look into additional folders?\n. adding the path globally (Anaconda.sublime-settings) works. \nBut adding it to project specific settings doesn't.

    "eivind88": "I'm late to the party, but I'd also like to help.\nMaybe Spyder could be leveraged.\nThe library provides a variable explorer (source) and debugging features, amongst other things.\n. I've been thinking more about this as of late.\nThe Sublime Text package Python Breakpoints shows how breakpoints may be implemented.\nIn addition to this and what I've mentioned in the previous comment I've also been inspired by the Atom package Hydrogen.\nAs I've got some spare time these days I'm thinking about trying to implement something.\nDoes anyone have any preference as to what variable inspection should look like?\n. No progress on breakpoints or variable inspection as of yet, but I've hacked together a quick proof of concept for inline eval/exec of Python code.\n\nIt's very much inspired by the functionality of the Hydrogen package for Atom (as seen below).\n\nIs this something that you think would be appropriate as an Anaconda feature?\n. Anaconda already supports Goto Definition via a keyboard shortcut.\n. @DamnWidget Terribly sorry for responding so late.\nI ran out of time back in 2015, and kinda got lost in the POC i GIF'ed in the last comment on issue #54.\nI didn't really get far with regards to a variable inspector; I just thought a bit about how I could make a limited demo with the then limited UI, e.g. hooking globals/locals into a panel or something like that. The plugin API has improved somewhat since then, though - now offering permanent panels, inline phantoms and whatnot.\nAs a sidenote, I'm currently working on an implementation of inline code evaluation and more via Jupyter integration, which I don't think would be a appropriate for Anaconda..

    "delicb": "I agree with your suggestions and I made changes according to them. \n. Ok, in next commit I will update README.md too.\n. Both with existing files and new bufferes that have never been saved.\n. You can see my configuration here: https://github.com/delicb/SublimeConfig/blob/master/Preferences.sublime-settings\nAnaconda configuration is here: https://github.com/delicb/SublimeConfig/blob/master/Anaconda.sublime-settings\nI am on Windows 8, x64 with Sublime Text 3047 and Anaconda from github (commit c0490d7).\nList of my installed plugins:\n- \"Anaconda\",\n- \"GenerateUUID\",\n- \"Git Config\",\n- \"INI\",\n- \"Pretty JSON\",\n- \"Restructured Text (RST) Snippets\",\n- \"SideBarEnhancements\",\n- \"SublimeREPL\",\n- \"Theme - Soda\",\n- \"Tomorrow Color Schemes\",\n- \"VCS Gutter\"\nI will try to remove one-by-one and check if any of them is problematic.\n. I have created empty profile with only Package Control and Anaconda installed via Package Control and I was able to reproduce this bug.\nBut I was not able to reproduce it on linux box.\nI guess that it is something related to operating system or sublime build for windows.\nIf I can provide any more information in order to track the bug, please let me know.\n. Usually, I always use os.path.join when working with paths, but in this case, I entered path according to sublime documentation (https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html) that states:\n\nThe icon name may also be a full package relative path, such as Packages/Theme - Default/dot.png.\n\nThat is why I used this format. Also, folder when I have cloned Anaconda repo on my computer is called Anaconda, but I have tried changing it to anaconda and sublime is able to find icons. But this does not meat that it will work on all platforms (I am on windows at the momment). This should be tested on unix platforms (because of their file naming rules) and I will do it as soon as I get access to linux box. But I expect this to work on linux as well because it is not path on file system (icon can be in .sublime-package file) and I expect sublime to do the right thing. Unfortunately, I did not found any additional mention of it in sublime documentation.\n. I agree, I will fix this. My intention was to make it more readable and not exceed 79 characters in line, but You are right, this is not more readable then key=value format.\n. Btw, I have tried now following code:\npython\nico_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', '..',\n                           'gutter_mark_themes', '{theme}-{type}.png'))\nAnd it returns right path to icons, but icons are not visible in gutter. I guess that it means that sublime does not support absolute paths to gutter icons.\n. Almost.\nThis works on windows and linux with different folder names (e.g. AnacondaV2 folder name works just fine):\npython\npackage_name = os.path.dirname(__file__).rsplit(os.path.sep, 3)[1]\nico_path = 'Packages/' + package_name + \"/gutter_mark_themes/{theme}-{type}.png\"\nI can not use os.path.join to create icon path, that does not work on windows, since it uses \\ as path separator and sublime requires /.\nI will add this change to next commit.\n.

    "olimpiurob": "Hi, \nThis implies that there's already a project file. However, few settings are different from project to project. Among them, anaconda settings. Having a hidden directory with a hidden conf file containing these settings would be helpful, because it could be generated easily by a shell script, and it would only need to contain the python interpreter path and the extra paths. This way, you wouldn't necesarily need a project file.\n. ",
    "mkurek": "What you have mentioned is exactly what i need. Most of my projects have their own interpreter and extra paths and i switch a lot between these projects. Changes in interpreter/extra paths in project settings are not so important for me as switching between projects.

I'm still seeing this behaviour.\nI verified this latest code is in my Packages dir and restarted Sublime.\n. Thank you for your time. Unfortunately, this change has not fixed it and has introduced new undesired behavior: if you hit tab to complete before the autocomplete window shows up, then the completion will be deleted. This problem always persists for imports. For example,\npython\nimport da<tab>\nIt'll try to autocomplete to \"date\" and then immediately delete what was shown and go back to \"da\" (without showing the autocomplete window). When you type enough in (e.g., \"datet\") and press tab, the autocomplete window shows up (but the tab is inserted) so completion ends up with the original \"import datetdatetime\" issue.\nLet me know if there is more info I can provide.\n. Back to the original issue described at the top (no longer is there the secondary bug of immediately deleting the autocompleted text). In other words, this is still happening:\npython\nimport da<tab>datetime\n. @DamnWidget As OP, confirming your workaround solved my problem. Thanks for enduring this one. :-)\n. ",

Except for the  being displayed, it's the same, what I previously typed is still there when autocompletion is done.\nI'm on Ubuntu 13.04 64 bits, Sublime Text 3 Build 3059, and the only packages I'm using are:\n- PackageControl\n- GitGutter\n- SideBarEnhancements\n- TrailingSpaces\n- Theme - Soda\n- Anaconda (of course), installed from git since Package Control wasn't listing it (even though it's listed in the website)\nYep, I've resorted to use dot autocompletion, which works great!\n. I've removed package control and Anaconda, install the first one manually and the second one through the first one, yeah :)\nI have no user configuration for Anaconda, and just did a diff with Default configuration between Git and mine, and they're identical.\nOh, I'm stupid, in my 2 previous comments, I typed tab between chevrons, of course it didn't appear...\nJust to be clear, my problem is that, when dot completion is disabled, when I type \"self.\" and then tab, the pop-up with suggestions appears, but \"self.\" is replaced by \"selfself.\".\n.

But that's beside the point of this issue.\n\n@DamnWidget \n\nAnyway this is how PyFlakes works, that behaviour is not defined into anaconda but PyFlakes. If you want to see that behaviour changed, you should put yourself in contact with PyFlakes maintainers.\n\nTo state more explicitly,\nI believe PyFlakes' behavior is correct as it stands. What I was suggesting is that Anaconda should  outline/highlight the decorators as well as the entire function name and parameters (from def to :). Some extra handling done in Anaconda, for that specific class of errors, involving functions. For better UX. (by highlighting the entire function, it looks nicer. :)\nNow that I am revisiting it, I'm not really feeling strongly about this but you're up to decide what to do. In fact, it seems to me that highlighting just the first decorator, however not-best-possible, is a better thing to do than handling all the kinds of edge cases that might show up if Anaconda did as I had suggested.\nThis isn't a big-fix but a non-trivial, not-worth-the-effort enhancement.

If there is a problem and possibility for collision with existing libraries, would it not make more sense to use the \"vendor\" pattern instead of path magic? For example pip uses this pattern https://github.com/pypa/pip/tree/develop/pip where they put all their dependencies inside the _vendor package and they do from pip._vendor.requests import whatever to avoid that kind of dependency conflicts. I think it should be rather easy to implement it here because you already have the packages inside the repo and then it would be a question of removing the path magic addition and replace the import jedi with something like from anaconda._vendor import jedi or wherever the jedi lib will be?\n.

I then restarted and guess what, everything worked perfectly from that point on.

For some reason, localhost and http://127.0.0.1/ do not resolve to anything, but http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree works when ipython notebook is running and http://127.0.0.1:8000/ works for a django server.\n. I've figured it out.  Thanks for your help.\n. Hi,\nThe issue has come back again.\nmy path is this: /usr/local/bin/python:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\"which python\" gives me this: /usr/local/bin/python\nIn the anaconda python_interpreter setting i have tried both \"python\" and \"usr/local/bin/python\"\nIs there anything blaringly wrong with this?\n. It is working now, but I did get this out put from conole upon install\nignored packages updated to: [Vintage, Anaconda]\nfound 1 files for base name Soda Dark 3.sublime-theme\nErrors parsing theme:\nAnimated properties must have both target and speed specified\ntheme loaded\nreloading Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings\nfound 1 files for base name Soda Dark 3.sublime-theme\nErrors parsing theme:\nAnimated properties must have both target and speed specified\ntheme loaded\nignored packages updated to: [Vintage]\nfound 1 files for base name Soda Dark 3.sublime-theme\nreloading Packages/User/Package Control.sublime-settings\nreloading plugin Anaconda.anaconda\nPersisten list does not exists, skiping load...\ngenerating meta info summary\nfound 8 files for base name Default.sublime-keymap\nErrors parsing theme:\nAnimated properties must have both target and speed specified\ntheme loaded\nreloading Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings\nfound 7 files for base name Main.sublime-menu\nfound 1 files for base name Soda Dark 3.sublime-theme\nErrors parsing theme:\nAnimated properties must have both target and speed specified\ntheme loaded\nI will close this in a few days if I don't see any more issues.\n. Well, the issue is happening again.  I just opened my comp and went from a tab with a .html file to a tab with .py file and it is frozen.  Do you think it has anything to do with my template or theme from the console logs above?\n. Just removed the Application Support file and did a fresh install of ST3.  Installed package manager then Anaconda. As soon as I open or create a .py file it freezes. :/\nAny other ideas? If nothing else, I might just reformat.\n. in the anaconda-2 folder is the file anaconda_jsonserver.log which contains this:\n2014-05-10 02:30:00,072: ERROR   : Traceback (most recent call last):\n

And it only updates when there is an error. If I save again after fixing the error, even syntax errors and pep8 stuff don't update. I have to manually enter a syntax error, save to update anaconda, then remove the error (which leaves that one syntax error message there still).\n.

    "rahul-ramadas": "Yes, I am using Python3.\n. There is a new release of the Jedi library. I just did a quick test and it seems to fix this issue. Do you mind integrating that release into Anaconda?\n. Right now, it looks like both linting and auto-complete are disabled on repl windows. Would it be possible to disable linting but keep auto-complete? Removing the check for repl and then disabling linting manually seems to do the trick but obviously it would be a lot more convenient if it happened automatically.\n. I don't think it will break it because prior to that fix the call was blocking, so it would block until the OS decided to cancel it (how much time it takes before it gives up is OS-specific). In my fix there is still a timeout, except it is more aggressive.\nI removed the sleep(0.01) because I think connect on a socket is always going to be blocking, and with the 0.01s timeout on the connect, it seemed unnecessary to yield again.\nBTW, take a look at the doc-string on BackgroundLinter.on_modified. That is not accurate, on_modified is called synchronously, you need to override on_modified_async if you want async behaviour. Which actually gives me another idea for a better fix: maybe I can change all the listeners that call Worker.execute() to async, then make sure to start the worker while holding the WORKERS_LOCK, so as not to acceidentally start them twice. That should fix this I think.\n. So I'm testing out a different fix. Please take a look at a46116b656c4c01f76010fa158c55ea30cfc89ff. I know that you mentioned in #97 that there seems to be high memory usage if you use async callbacks. I'm trying to see if that problem comes back with this change. Currently Anaconda seems to be attempting linting every 500ms, even if nothing changed in the buffer. I fixed that, and maybe that was the root cause for #97. Let me do some testing and get back to you.\n. I assume the *_async methods exist if you want to perform blocking operations. When I say 'blocking' I mean operations that at an OS-level can actually cause the thread to go into a wait state, network I/O being a good example. That is pretty much the only thing CPython threads are useful for, and they are pretty useful for that.\nIn Anaconda, the act of creating the Worker and connecting to the server is indeed a blocking operation, and it could benefit from the *_async methods. The problem is that if the Worker creation is going to be done async, then we have to be careful to not have multiple threads trying to create and connect to the Worker, and that is what I used the lock for. Basically a simple implementation of a Singleton. In the non-async versions of the listener we got this protection for free because all the callbacks will be serialized on the main thread. Now, I'm not quite sure if Sublime uses a single thread to deliver all the async callbacks, or a pool of threads. If it is the former, I guess we don't need the locking. In my experimentation I saw only one thead delivering the async callbacks, but I'm not sure I can rely on that.\nYou are right about the get_workers_lock function call; that was pretty hacky :stuck_out_tongue:. I was trying to get access to the lock from the decorator and couldn't find a way without introducing a circular import.\nYes, the 500ms linting action does not cause I/O to the server, but it does wake up every 500ms to check if linting needs to be done, decides it does not need to, and then reschedules another call 500ms later (the set_timeout() call in lint() is unconditional). I think it can be made a bit more intelligent, although I'm probably micro-optimizing here.\nI ran your experiment of allocating large amounts of memory in an *_async callback. This is what I tried:\n``` python\nimport sublime_plugin\nclass TestPluginListenever(sublime_plugin.EventListener):\n    def on_modified_async(self, view):\n        bigList = [1] * 100000000\n        print('bigList {}'.format(len(bigList)))\n```\nAs you can see, this is pretty brutal. By doing edits really fast (which actually causes UI slowdowns even though it is async; I guess it even saturates the async pool), I can make the memory usage go as high as ~800MB, but a couple of seconds after stopping, it falls back down to ~40MB, which is around what it started with. So I don't think I see the problem you are referring to. I even tried allocating lesser memory and I don't see the memory usage increasing and not ever decreasing.\nAnyways, getting back to the main issue: how can we create and connect to the server without blocking the main thread? Do you have any other ideas?\n. You're right, this is getting overly complicated. I think we can settle on just a shorter timeout. Can you just change the connect timeout and the sleep() in the is_server_active to 0.05secs? Or I can send a pull request if you like...\n. Sent pull request #157.\n. Note that I've snuck in another change :stuck_out_tongue:. I had always noticed this message about some persistent list appearing in my console. It seemed unnecessary, so I've removed it. Feel free to reject that if you like.\n. I did the same thing, importing the version of jedi that is part of my Anaconda installation (I don't have jedi installed as part of my Python installation), and I don't have finditer in the list.\n```\nPython 3.4.0 (v3.4.0:04f714765c13, Mar 16 2014, 19:25:23) [MSC v.1600 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\n\n\nimport os\nos.getcwd()\n'C:\\Programs\\Sublime'\nos.chdir(r'C:\\Programs\\Sublime\\Data\\Packages\\Anaconda\\anaconda_lib')\nimport jedi\ns = jedi.Script('import re\\nre.')\nfor c in s.completions():\n...     print(c)\n... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n.

Yes, and the commit that removed PythonTest.tmLanguage is e16ca2aca6da68ab5ea55ca99327afd24fbe6340, whose parent is 01e707b216c07156c44916c0d6e4b72d5f289666.\n. No problem. You might as well wait till you make more commits before you do that. I'm not sure if Package Control will update existing installations if the version tag points to a new commit.\n.

Closing a reopening the file has no effect, but a full restart of ST3 usually allows editing. It feels like the autopep8 process needs to be terminated when the file is closed, at least. Also, giving it some kind of timeout seems like a good idea.\n. This is definitely improved. I'll close the issue and reopen if I come across any further issues.\n.

If you open two views on the same file and save one, the code is formatted, and the file is saved, however, ST3 seems to get stuck in a format save cycle.

This is on Arch Linux 4.12.3-1.. I just started working on it again after having the process killed and I'm currently not seeing any elevated process or RAM usage on the server. I'll check more often from now on to get an indication of what might be the issue.. Okay, Anaconda just made my PC come to a crawl and made me force shutdown it because I couldn't even start to open a terminal in order to shut it down. I noticed the elevated CPU usage in my bar on my desktop and when I started top, it immediately came to a crawling halt and I heard my music playing bit by bit (literally). Chromium was also acting weird because it seemed to be out of memory. For now I still can't provide you with any real code to reproduce the issue, but this project will be open sourced in the future if that is any help at all. :/\nI probably caught it at a good time earlier today, but now it probably slurped all of my RAM and swap space and made my PC crash I guess. So it took 32GB of memory on average (16GB RAM and 16GB swap).\nEdit: It seemed to have messed top up: . Alright, I'm starting to tail the file right now and let's hope I notice it before it goes berserk again.. ",

No non-ASCII chars at all.\nI use Python 2.7 (and the file runs without errors).\nI'll get back with logs from DEBUG mode.\nThanks.\n. I changed that file and it doesn't reproduce anymore.\nTherefore I'll close this issue (at least for now).\n.

Or should I directly set the various keys under settings, without the use of an \"anaconda\" object?\n. That's what I've been looking for, thanks! For some reason, I've been following SublimeLinter's logic regarding project-specific settings and thought I'd have to encapsulate your config keys in their own separate namespace. Again, thanks, it works as intended! :+1:\n. ",
    "haakenlid": "I've discovered that the program only crashes if I use the setting \"python_interpreter\" in my project file.\nIt's the process called \"opt/sublime_text/plugin_host\" that freezes. I can kill the process, but that disables all plugins until I restart Sublime Text.\nI'm not sure if the crash is caused by the new python builder, but it must be related since it only happens when the Anaconda plugin is enabled, and whenever the project file is modified by anaconda. For example when I open a file in my project or switch between projects. \n. I think that there's a typo in  anaconda_lib / worker.py that causes the plugin to overwrite the current build system. \n155      sublime.active_window().project_data().get('buil_systems')):\nThe freezing appears to be solved when I comment out these lines in the same file.

    "oblalex": "Okay, I'll report next time.\nAs I have said, I'm not sure that it's all about Anaconda. It's quite possible that the problem is caused by Sublime itself or something else. Anaconda's changelog is just the first thing that catches your eye after crash.\nThanks for your answer anyway :wink:\n. Well, this has happened again. The only message I get is this: http://pastebin.com/mnSAeHrM\nI use Anaconda since 1.2.1 or 1.2.2 and see that message at least one time a day. Have no ideas for further steps.\n. @DamnWidget no, this started to happen from the very begining, 1.2.1 or 1.2.2. Before that I haven't use Anaconda at all.\nAnd before Anaconda, I was getting update messages from other packages. They appeared simetimes only when I started Sublime and I saw them not often really, so everything seemed to be fine. With Anaconda installed, Sublime crashes and then usually shows Anaconda updates even having updates turned off.\nHere are my configs and a list of installed packages: https://gist.github.com/oblalex/8206412\nMaybe this may help somehow.\n. Hello.\nThank you. Done as you said. I'll let you know if there will be some changes in behaviour in next 24 hours.\n. Hi, there!\nA crash had happen again. This time I can see no Anaconda messages, so you can stop worrying about this ussue.\nSublime just wipes out. This is typical behaviour in the Unixland caused by memory leaks. So, I think it time for me to move to ST forum.\nThanks for your help\n. ",

Hi - I'm using OS X (10.10) and looked at the log file.

And it also looks like autocompletion doesn't work for the entire pandas package (since I couldn't do \"pd.\" and get valid autocompletions either).\nI also tried the dev branch of Jedi and that does raise an error when I try autocompletions for anything from pandas:\n2014-11-16 11:57:09,084: ERROR   : The underlying Jedi library as raised an exception\n2014-11-16 11:57:09,084: ERROR   : 'module' object has no attribute 'clear_caches'\nI'll open an issue w/ Jedi, looks like they've added support for numpy/scipy/etc but I don't see an explicit mention of pandas.\n. Hi - I was looking at a few threads on the Jedi project, and found this thread. So I installed jedi via pip, then tried the following in a Python console:\nprint(jedi.Script('import pandas; df = pandas.DataFrame(); df.').completions())\nprint(jedi.Script('import pandas; pandas.').completions())\nBoth the above work and I see a bunch of completions. [Interestingly, the one in the thread with the numpy array \"a.\" doesn't work but I suspect that fix has not yet been released.]\nThe version of jedi installed by pip is 0.8.1-final0. I don't see a 0.8.1-final0 tag in the jedi project but there is one w/ v0.8.1 so I tried replacing the jedi folder in Anaconda w/ the 0.8.1 jedi library. But I'm still not getting any autocompletions for pd. or df. in Anaconda. I'm wondering now if there's a problem w/ Anaconda and the way it interacts w/ jedi? \n. The Anaconda log looks the same as before (completions list is empty). Or did you mean a different log?\n. Hi - thanks a lot for the information and that screenshot! That helped me figure out what was going on. Turns out that ST3 doesn't pick up the python interpreter from my path, instead it was using the system one. I specified the python interpreter for ST3 (and also in Anaconda, though it looks like Anaconda does pick it up from the path) and it's working now! (I also ended up upgrading to ST3 3066 as I was using 3065). \nOne thing I noticed was that ST3 hangs quite a bit after I trigger an autocomplete (for reference, I haven't had ST3 hang at all for the last few months that I've been using it). I force quit the app and have the Console log/trace but can't seem to find a log file for ST3. Don't see anything related to the hang in Anaconda logs.\nThink I can reproduce at will now - if I trigger an autocomplete, and then switch to another app before the results of the autocomplete show up, ST3 hangs. I take it this is an ST3 issue?\n. Hi,\nThis gist has my Anaconda and ST3 settings. Not sure what \"project configuration\" means but I don't have any specific configuration for this project.\nI misspoke above .. it's not ST3 python interpreter, but the interpreter for SublimePythonIDE, which I'd installed a while back. I just removed this package since I don't think it's needed anymore given Anaconda. I can't reproduce the crash anymore! Thanks for catching this!\nHowever, there is one new issue - when I type \"pandas.\" the default completions show up for a second (or more if it's the first time after the Anaconda server starts up) before the Anaconda completions replace the default ones. I believe this is what the two suppress_* config options in Anaconda are for, so maybe there's a problem with my Anaconda config. I also tried adding the two suppress options to the Python.sublime-settings file but that did not work either.\n. Hi - thanks for explaining the architecture. Few questions:\n1. I see that the Anaconda server shuts down after a 30mins inactivity period. Is this configurable? I'm guessing this has memory implications but would be nice to have this option if it's quick.\n2. The time it takes for Anaconda to make the 2nd/Nth call to Jedi and update the results seems  a bit high given that Jedi already has a cache. Curious how iPython does this so quickly even for large packages like pandas.\n3. I use SublimeREPL and noticed that Anaconda has taken over the completions in the iPython console (via SublimeREPL) as well.. is there any way to disable Anaconda in the REPL?\n. Hi - will file the feature requests and yes, iPython is pretty cool! Thanks a lot for all your help and work, Anaconda is pretty cool too!\n. Update - it appears that Anaconda does not take over auto-completions in the iPython SublimeREPL.. I'm not sure how/why it did that day when I reported this but I can't reproduce it anymore. Will keep an eye out and update if I see otherwise but all good for now on that front.\n. ",

I figured out how to hack together some docker support (at least for in file linting).\nThe process is basically to run the vagrant server from the same docker image you are running your code from, and then point anaconda to that port.\nI made a bash script that will clone and run the anaconda vagrant server. To use this with your Docker host, you can execute this script within whatever image you are using to run your code.\n``` bash\ndefault python 3 image\n$ docker run --rm -it -p 19360:19360 --entrypoint bash python -c 'source <(curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/saulshanabrook/74d3447d2758462e2bf8/raw/977d88f5451d49b73abde8543e235ba0c9c44849/up.py)'\nor if you are building your own image\n$ docker build -t my-thing .\n$ docker run --rm -it -p 19360:19360 --entrypoint bash  my-thing -c 'source <(curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/saulshanabrook/74d3447d2758462e2bf8/raw/977d88f5451d49b73abde8543e235ba0c9c44849/up.py)'\n```\nThen create a sublime text project and configure it to support vagrant. For the network, using the IP of your docker instance (boot2docker ip if on a mac) and themodeof\"private\"`. For example:\n{\n    \"build_systems\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Anaconda Python Builder\",\n            \"selector\": \"source.python\",\n            \"shell_cmd\": \"python -u \\\"$file\\\"\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"folders\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"follow_symlinks\": true,\n            \"path\": \".\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"settings\":\n    {\n        \"vagrant_environment\": {\n            \"directory\": \"/Users/saul/\",       // Directory where the Vagrantfile is located in your local machine\n            \"network\": {\n                \"mode\": \"private\",          // configured vagrant network mode\n                \"address\": \"192.168.59.103\",  // guest machine IP address\n                \"port\": 19360               // guest machine anaconda vagrant_server port\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nthe directory is irrelevant, because their is no vagrantfile. However, you need vagrant installed (brew cask install vagrant) or else Sublime Text will crash when trying to lint a python file with these settings.\nNow you can get syntax completion/errors for your Docker python environment!\nObviously, it is still very messy, and just hacked together. \n. @DamnWidget this seems to sorta work, but whenever I type a character, the server logs an error\nE302\nE302\nE302\nerror: uncaptured python exception, closing channel <__main__.JSONHandler connected 192.168.59.3:60400 at 0x7f40f1212dd8> (<class 'TypeError'>:__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'html' [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|read|83] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|handle_read_event|442] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asynchat.py|handle_read|171] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|found_terminator|93] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|handle_command|111] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|run|30] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/lib/anaconda_handler.py|run|48] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|doc|98])\nerror: uncaptured python exception, closing channel <__main__.JSONHandler connected 192.168.59.3:60403 at 0x7f40f2990588> (<class 'TypeError'>:__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'html' [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|read|83] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|handle_read_event|442] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asynchat.py|handle_read|171] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|found_terminator|93] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|handle_command|111] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|run|30] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/lib/anaconda_handler.py|run|48] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|doc|98])\nerror: uncaptured python exception, closing channel <__main__.JSONHandler connected 192.168.59.3:60406 at 0x7f40f11c86d8> (<class 'TypeError'>:__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'html' [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|read|83] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|handle_read_event|442] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asynchat.py|handle_read|171] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|found_terminator|93] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|handle_command|111] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|run|30] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/lib/anaconda_handler.py|run|48] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|doc|98])\nerror: uncaptured python exception, closing channel <__main__.JSONHandler connected 192.168.59.3:60408 at 0x7f40f1020d68> (<class 'TypeError'>:__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'html' [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|read|83] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|handle_read_event|442] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asynchat.py|handle_read|171] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|found_terminator|93] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|handle_command|111] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|run|30] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/lib/anaconda_handler.py|run|48] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|doc|98])\nerror: uncaptured python exception, closing channel <__main__.JSONHandler connected 192.168.59.3:60410 at 0x7f40f1020eb8> (<class 'TypeError'>:__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'html' [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|read|83] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|handle_read_event|442] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asynchat.py|handle_read|171] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|found_terminator|93] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|handle_command|111] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|run|30] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/lib/anaconda_handler.py|run|48] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|doc|98])\nerror: uncaptured python exception, closing channel <__main__.JSONHandler connected 192.168.59.3:60412 at 0x7f40f1020f98> (<class 'TypeError'>:__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'html' [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|read|83] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asyncore.py|handle_read_event|442] [/usr/local/lib/python3.4/asynchat.py|handle_read|171] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|found_terminator|93] [../anaconda_server/jsonserver.py|handle_command|111] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|run|30] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/lib/anaconda_handler.py|run|48] [/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py|doc|98])\n. @DamnWidget I don't know, sorry I don't use Vagrant.\n.

Maybe keep these experimental features clearly separated from the regular features and conditionally enabled as you said. I just have a feeling that it might be a while yet before the next official release, and the tooltips seem really neat.\n. Well that is really awesome, thank you so much for the quick feature addition!\n.  This is what it looks like for me. My font of choice doesn't lend itself to being arbitrarily resized for the \"title\", but I could fiddle with the CSS I suppose. It's really neat, thank you!\n. And I still love it. Thank you, I will.\n. I am using Windows 7 and haven't noticed anything of that sort, sorry that I can't be of more help. I'll let you know if I notice anything! This should clearly be an issue with the Jedi library, right?\n. I just copied the tkinter package from C:\\Python34\\Lib directly next to the script that I am trying to import it from, even then the autocompletion doesn't work and I can't jump to the definition either with the message: \"Unable to find tkinter\". Jumping to the \"tkinter.ttk\" definition (i.e. the module) works, although autocompletion for that module does not.\n. There was no issue that mentioned this bug.

Okay, it seems it was SublimeCodeIntel and Anaconda playing against each other. Removing the former and installing CodeComplice helped. I'll close this here.\n. It's easy to reproduce but probably I did a poor job to define it.\nhere's a test code, copy it to a file, and test it for yourself:\n``` python\nclass TestClass(object):\n    def init(self):\n        self.list_test_variable = [1,2,3]\ndef test_func(self):\n    # autocompleting self works here BEFORE the for cycle\n    for self._iter_variable in [6,7,8]:\n        pass\n    # autocompleting self fails here AFTER the for cycle\n\n```\nAutocompleting self will show up list_test_variable before the for cycle, but not after the for cycle. The problem lies probably in the for cycle, where assign values directly to self.\nCan you work with this?\n. Did a bug report over there, thanks for your cooperation.\n. Well, it's not such a huge breaker, just something I stumbled upon. Cheers :)\n. @DamnWidget ?\n. interesting, doing a fresh anaconda install on a blank sublime makes the problem disappear.\nI'm trying to find out which plugin causes the autoformatting to fail.\nreverting to my sublime with all the packages and trying to autoformat which fails, produces no errors in the console. where do I find the Jedi cache dir?

I experience the same slowdown since a recent anaconda update. Can I help out somehow here?. I'm not sure if my opinion counts, but I don't refactor much. It's all about planning your code in the right way, without premature optimization :). @DamnWidget, I admire your work with this plugin, which does wonders with Python development. however - and I don't think this is your fault - since you updated the supplied Jedi version, things got worse.\nI also see the jsonserver process ramping up its CPU use to 100%, and sometimes the tooltips for the type casted objects don't show up properly, other times they do. I started to open up another extra two screen terminals: one is for running a top to see what jsonserver is currently doing, and another one just for killing the jsonserver process and removing the jedi cache: rm -rvf ~/.cache/jedi/; pkill -f jsonserver\nthis temporarily fixes the problem until it reoccurs in 1-2 hours.\nI'm not sure how I can be helpful for you, as I'm working on a huge django based project with many dependencies. I'm using python 3.6.. ```python\n\n\n\nsys.stdin\n<_io.TextIOWrapper name='' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>\n```. I'll try, but I'll have to look into how to do it. I'll check back later with results, hopefully.. Refactored to separate issue: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/682. something has definitely changed, as anaconda is now doing the 'reading up the source' part, which it didn't anymore after having it updated and removing the jedi cache. will test further, I'll let you know about the results :). what I can report is, the CPU peaks don't occur anymore with this branch.\n\n\n\nas for the rest, I'm reporting them in separate issues.. Hm, I think I've found a related bug, here's the log with the traceback:\n```\nINFO:root:client requests: doc\nReceived method: doc, handler: jedi\n handler retrieved from registry\nERROR:root:list index out of range\nERROR:root:Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/karolyi/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\", line 105, in found_terminator\n    self.handle_command(handler_type, method, uid, vid, data)\n  File \"/home/karolyi/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\", line 132, in handle_command\n    handler(method, data, uid, vid, self.return_back, DEBUG_MODE).run()\n  File \"/home/karolyi/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py\", line 30, in run\n    super(JediHandler, self).run()\n  File \"/home/karolyi/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/lib/anaconda_handler.py\", line 48, in run\n    command(**kwargs)\n  File \"/home/karolyi/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py\", line 99, in doc\n    Doc(self.callback, self.uid, self.script, html)\n  File \"/home/karolyi/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/commands/doc.py\", line 33, in init\n    super(Doc, self).init(callback, uid)\n  File \"/home/karolyi/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/commands/base.py\", line 14, in init\n    self.run()\n  File \"/home/karolyi/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/commands/doc.py\", line 39, in run\n    if self._check_nonsense():\n  File \"/home/karolyi/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/commands/doc.py\", line 78, in _check_nonsense\n    cursor = lines[line-1][column-1]\nIndexError: list index out of range\n{'success': False, 'uid': '65df84d413774607a70c96910d3cfa04', 'vid': None, 'error': 'list index out of range'}\n```\nhappens when I add a new line at column 0.. yeah, I can understand it. as I said, I'm working on a complex code base, which for the moment cannot be opensourced. and since I don't have time to narrow down the source, we'll have to go with what I report.\nthanks for fixing it anyways, I pulled now, we'll see how it goes.. linking https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/680#issuecomment-319505115. yep, it's like a corner case, but still, it happens. again, it's the complex codebase I'm using, so I'm not sure what's causing it.. @davidhalter ?. @davidhalter after having tested with debug mode off, it seems that the issue is gone (however, it still seems slow with a rather large codebase)\nyou guys decide if you want to close this issue or to keep it open..

Update: I've tested by manually downgrading to 1.4.28 (and adding Anaconda to disable upgrade list in package control), the issue is not present, so it's a bug in 2.x!\n. Yes, I've even made a video about it:\nhttps://youtu.be/MdLU51O0c9U\nI did a bit of debugging, and what I found out is that run_linter(view) doesn't update the ANACONDA object.\nTry this code:\n```\ndef on_post_save(self, view):\n        \"\"\"Called post file save event\n        \"\"\"\n    print(ANACONDA['WARNINGS'])\n    if check_linting(\n            view, NOT_SCRATCH | LINTING_ENABLED, code=self.lang.lower()):\n        if self.lang in view.settings().get('syntax'):\n            self.run_linter(view)\n            print(ANACONDA['WARNINGS'])\n            if get_settings(\n                    view, \"anaconda_linter_show_errors_on_save\", False):\n                sublime.active_window().run_command('anaconda_get_lines')\n    else:\n        self._erase_marks_if_no_linting(view)\n\n```\nYou'll see that the lines are the same, before and after run_linter(view).\nIt seems that ANACONDA dict is being cached somehow in Python.\n. This tooltip thing goes even crazier from time to time. I made a screen capturing of the behaviour when it was just always displaying docstring tooltips, all the time, without me pressing any buttons, not even saving. Then after removing a character it displayed it again:\nhttps://youtu.be/2j5OUGclsTA\n. these are all my packages, I'll try to debug and see if disabling them helps:\n\"installed_packages\":\n    [\n        \"Anaconda\",\n        \"Compare Side-By-Side\",\n        \"CSS Format\",\n        \"Expand Tabs on Save\",\n        \"HexViewer\",\n        \"HTMLBeautify\",\n        \"INI\",\n        \"JavaScriptNext - ES6 Syntax\",\n        \"Jinja2\",\n        \"JsFormat\",\n        \"JSHint\",\n        \"JSONLint\",\n        \"LESS\",\n        \"Less2Css\",\n        \"Neon Color Scheme\",\n        \"Package Control\",\n        \"Plist Binary\",\n        \"Pretty JSON\",\n        \"Python Flake8 Lint\",\n        \"Python Improved\",\n        \"Theme - Soda\",\n        \"URLEncode\"\n    ]\n. I found it! It's Expand Tabs on Save, an other very useful package for Python developers.\nThe whole package is only 10 lines of Python code, I believe you can even integrate the functionality into Anaconda if you'd like. It'd be a great feature for Anaconda (very useful to convert tabs to spaces in the Python world), and this bug could be taken care of.\nhttps://github.com/bubenkoff/ExpandTabsOnSave-SublimeText/blob/master/ExpandTabsOnSave.py\nBTW, the code of that plugin is just super super simple, all it does is it runs view.run_command('expand_tabs') in an on_pre_save hook. I think Anaconda should handle this situation easily, there must be other plugins doing something in a on_pre_save hook.\n. I guess there must be a workaround, why would an on_modified trigger a docstring window? I believe if you'd integrate this feature into Anaconda itself, you can control exactly when is it called thus avoid the bug. But what with all other plugins which call something similar?\n. But I explicitly disabled the linting: with \"anaconda_linting\": false,\n. Cool, looking forwards to trying it!\n. Here are my packages:\n\"installed_packages\":\n    [\n        \"Anaconda\",\n        \"Clickable URLs\",\n        \"Compare Side-By-Side\",\n        \"Dockerfile Syntax Highlighting\",\n        \"Filter Lines\",\n        \"HexViewer\",\n        \"INI\",\n        \"JavaScriptNext - ES6 Syntax\",\n        \"Jinja2\",\n        \"LESS\",\n        \"Neon Color Scheme\",\n        \"Package Control\",\n        \"Predawn\",\n        \"Pretty JSON\",\n        \"Python Flake8 Lint\",\n        \"Python Improved\",\n        \"Sass\",\n        \"Schemr\",\n        \"SCSS\",\n        \"SideBarEnhancements\",\n        \"StandardFormat\",\n        \"SublimeLinter\",\n        \"SublimeLinter-contrib-standard\",\n        \"SublimeLinter-json\",\n        \"SublimeLinter-shellcheck\",\n        \"Themr\",\n        \"URLEncode\"\n    ]\nBut this one is something really new, I'll try to test it with some older Anaconda version.\nActually the most annoying part is not just the visual flickering, but that it actually inserts the automatic help text a few seconds after I started typing! So I end up with thing like os.path.isfile(MYFILENAMEpath), just using capital letters to show the bits I typed.\n. So far, I've changed my Anaconda dir to be git controlled and added it to package control. Now the issue is not present, even if I go back to 2.1.16, or at least I cannot reproduce it.\nHowever there is an even more serious issue. I've quit Sublime Text (possibly multiple times) and a python process eating 99% of my CPU, using 1 GB of memory each has stayed running. From the open file handles it is exactly the Anaconda server, as it has an open handle to the Anaconda log.\n\n\n. Do you mean that Anaconda isn't inserting path in os.path.isfile(path)? It definitely does it for me. If I disable it won't happen, if I enabled it does.\nI'll look into how to reproduce it consistently, I couldn't do it either.. Yes, normally it just inserts the code and selects it. But in that buggy / laggy version interaction it was inserting it about a second or two after I started typing, thus making the text actually appear.\nI'm opening a separate ticket about 100% CPU in 2.1.17. It's not present in 2.1.16.\n. @DamnWidget I've opened a separate ticket for 2.1.17 as it's a totally unrelated issue I believe.\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/632\n. The rollback / 2.1.18 seems to have fixed it, I'll report if I found anything after longer testing.. @DamnWidget thanks, that looks clean, I'll have a look at a PR. . #720 is my PR, including some smarter caching for settings.. OK, if it's not actually reading and decoding the ST settings file on each get_settings then it's indeed quite efficient. So is there some kind of dictionary caching for every settings, except for the environment file?. I can confirm there is no file activity, only some in-memory lookup. . I thought the logical thing would be to only read settings once. \nI'd just cache all settings per session. If something got changed it'd be normal for the user to reopen the project or restart the editor, wouldn't it? . I made a first try at #720, needs more testing. Also, since a subprocess is quite slow, I'm not sure we should add the default values to the cache. I'll also ask Pipenv to add the two information (--py, --venv) in one command, not two, so we don't need two subprocesses.. @jamesandres look the Jedi CPU issue can be fixed by rolling back to 2.1.18. \nRemove the contents of the Anaconda folder and do a git clone into there, that way you can easily jump between versions.\n. Yes, I agree, unpacking a JSON on every keypress is absolutely crazy, no matter what Jedi is used. And caching that is such a simple fix actually!. @DamnWidget if I remove the pipfile support from #720, would you be willing to merge the JSON caching fix?. In theory it saves him an if os.path.exists(environfile) and os.path.isfile(environfile): but I doubt it'd give high CPU usage.\n@jamesandres can you try 2.1.18?. I still don't understand what is the problem of caching it. People almost never change their interpreter path, definitely not between every keypress.. I believe my caching only needs a tab to be reopened, not an ST3 restart.\nOn 24 November 2017 at 12:06, Oscar Campos notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThe problem with caching it is that you have to restart ST3 every time\nthat a modification is made to the file, and that is non acceptable.

Updated with smarter caching, also implements the functionality of what ENVIRON_HOOK_INVALID did before.. But why would anyone change their interpreter settings while having an open session? Actually why  would anyone change interpreter settings at all? There is just one interpreter per project, it actually never changes.\n\nWe can absolutely use pipenv without subprocess but that'd mean including quite a lot of dependencies (about 20 MB right now):\npipenv==8.2.7\n  - flake8 [required: Any, installed: 3.5.0]\n    - mccabe [required: >=0.6.0,<0.7.0, installed: 0.6.1]\n    - pycodestyle [required: <2.4.0,>=2.0.0, installed: 2.3.1]\n    - pyflakes [required: <1.7.0,>=1.5.0, installed: 1.6.0]\n  - pew [required: >=0.1.26, installed: 1.1.0]\n    - setuptools [required: >=17.1, installed: 36.6.0]\n    - virtualenv [required: >=1.11, installed: 15.1.0]\n    - virtualenv-clone [required: >=0.2.5, installed: 0.2.6]\n  - pip [required: >=9.0.1, installed: 9.0.1]\n  - requests [required: >2.18.0, installed: 2.18.4]\n    - certifi [required: >=2017.4.17, installed: 2017.7.27.1]\n    - chardet [required: >=3.0.2,<3.1.0, installed: 3.0.4]\n    - idna [required: <2.7,>=2.5, installed: 2.6]\n    - urllib3 [required: >=1.21.1,<1.23, installed: 1.22]\n  - urllib3 [required: >=1.21.1, installed: 1.22]\n  - virtualenv [required: Any, installed: 15.1.0].

Thanks -- here's the full log: https://gist.github.com/adrn/18bb2a5ca0667d3d870c05e8f3d306ba\nfor the relevant project.\n. I'll give that a try -- is this the only relevant path? \n~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Cache/ \n. (I deleted the cache and am just waiting a day to see how things go)\n. That doesn't seem to have worked. I've uploaded a screencast of the error happening and the triggered console Errors:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5zOs-LNN0E\n. It's not the semicolon that triggers it -- if I had just gone to a newline, the autocomplete window would still appear. I don't have any other autocomplete plugins installed, to my knowledge. These are the packages I have installed:\n\"Anaconda\",\n\"AutoWrap\",\n\"Base16 Color Schemes\",\n\"Cython\",\n\"Evernote\",\n\"GitGutter\",\n\"LaTeXTools\",\n\"Markdown Preview\",\n\"MinimalFortran\",\n\"Package Control\",\n\"Python 3\",\n\"RestructuredText Improved\",\n\"SublimeLinter\",\n\"SublimeLinter-pep8\",\n\"SublimeLinter-pyflakes\",\n\"Theme - Flatland\",\n\"Wrap Plus\"\nI'll try disabling everything else and see what happens.\n. OK I think I have some more info. It doesn't appear to be an extra firing / triggering of auto-complete, but rather a lag in the appearance of the autocomplete popup. Here's another video that probably explains it better.\n. The only error I get is the one I copied in the original issue message. I can't figure this one out. However, this issue is related to Anaconda. If I disable Anaconda, the autocomplete works normally and doesn't lag as it does in the video I posted in the previous comment.\n. FWIW, I think #532 is actually the same issue as what is discussed here. I'm still seeing this. Will try getting a jsonserver log. ",

My temp folder (/private/var/tmp) has like 10 items with 200Kb, so doesn't seem to be a problem.\nIs there a way to at least test which specific path it's complaining about? Quick google showed it might be an issue with the code itself not parsing links properly (e.g. using content of an xml file as input, giving out huge paths), but that's just outright speculation.\nAny other hints are welcome.\nP.S.\nAnd other addons work just fine (e.g. package control downloads packages just fine)\n. I found what the issue was! It relates to how ST3 reads shell environment details.\nI have Fish as my default shell and my config.fish had and echo command with some welcome message. And ST3 had that welcome message written in PATH variable.\nSo whenever Anaconda did its magic, it would trip over a long PATH (containing that lengthy welcome message without the typical : path separators) and give out that OSError: [Errno 63] File name too long error.\nAfter I've moved the welcome message to its proper place in fish_greeting.fish function the error went away (and the other bug for ColorSublime also went away).\nI found it out by chance when investigating why some addon wasn't able to read a shell environment variable for a GitHub API by running a import os;os.environ in ST3 console. While I still don't know how to make ST3 read environment variables from my shell config on start, at least I'm not worrying about this issue anymore.\n. Yep, and that fix adds a simple XML paragraph via the code you linked to and this line to an existing color scheme. And definition of the gutter_color region is exactly what allows that paragraph have any effect.\nIs there any chance you can add something like anaconda_gutter region so that color scheme can include a fix similar to that of GutterColor (by adding just one additional key)?\n. Thanks! That's exactly what I was looking for!\nWould you kindly add in the readme (and maybe in default settings) that setting Outline foreground colors is required for gutter icons to be displayed properly in light themes?\nAdding gutter word to wiki could also help (though wikis don't seem to be searchable by default when you type something in the search box).\nOtherwise it's hard to find out the solution the issue (I couldn't find anything with gutter and gutter color search words).\n.

It is jsonserver.py, I can almost guarantee that. Or any of its dependencies. This is a recurring issue. It happened to me again, yesterday.\n@DamnWidget you wrote about \"starting JsonServer in debug mode\". How would I go about doing that? Maybe that can help track the issue down?\n. Sorry I couldn't pay attention to this. I was out of the python field this past week. I expect to be able to try the debug server soon.\nIn the meantime, @DamnWidget did you consider the fact that crashes could not be reproduced by users not because jsonserver.py was started in debug mode, but because it was started manually (ie.: in another context)? Perhaps, that has more to do with RAM going wild that the actual debug flag.\nOn the other hand, this occurrences seemed to happen pretty randomly. At least, for me. With no apparent or predictable trigger. ST could be open for the whole laboring week without issues, or it may very well crash after just a few minutes.\n. @DamnWidget Similar situation here. Haven't used Anaconda in a while, so I can't really say. But it should really be you the one testing this out, instead of reviving a one and a half year old issue.\n. @DamnWidget Many ways: install package in another distro, or in a clean VM or vagrant machine, try it in a different OS altogether, use it in a friend's computer, try different versions and compare heap size, attempt to execute jsonserver.py on its own and see if you can spot anything, debug it, leave it running during the night, use a profiler.\nSeriously. Many, many ways.\n. Hi, @DamnWidget. I did take a look at the examples. None of them seemed very useful, honestly. They show samples for running tests using Twisted, Django and unittest, which aren't my case (and, also, do not correspond with the default setup).\nAny ideas? Could you, perhaps, point me to a sample project actually using Anaconda to run tests locally, that I could take a look at?\n. At first, without adding anything new to my sublime-projectfile, running Run project tests ended correctly, but didn't find any tests to run. \nSetting the \"test_project_path\" property to my project's root directory, made it work ok from within Anaconda.\n``` bash\n.......\n\nRan 7 tests in 0.051s\nOK\n[Finished in 0.2s]\n```\nI feel this should be reflected somewhere in the documentation. \"test_project_path\" is a mandatory configuration property if you intend to run this command.\nStill no luck with Current File Tests, though.\n. Isn't that what nose is for? Discovering tests and module imports? \nIf the functionality is running current file tests, why isn't Anaconda feeding to whatever command line I have configured in \"test_command\" the path of the currently displayed file?\n. Ok. I'll try to make a PR as soon as I'm able to. Could you, please, give some pointers as where to be looking at to add this changes?\nAlso, if I were to make the current settings work with my project (that is, running tests with module paths), how should I go about it? \nMy layout looks like this:\nsql-tools/\n    sql-tools/\n        sqltools.py\n        test/\n            test_sqltools.py\n.

Forgot to mention I'm using a 2.7.10 interpreter in a virtualenv. I'm on Gentoo also; probably not a factor, but still interesting.\nI'm using two really big libraries in the virtualenv, wxPython (related to https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/805 probably) and the Enthought Traits/Pyface libraries. There's also a fair amount of Cython code, but I think Jedi skips over that?. Thanks for taking a look at it. Sounds like we can't just plop in the new dev version of Jedi because of the API changes. I'd be willing to try to backport the fix from the current Jedi to the version that is compatible with Anaconda, but I can't find the commit in Jedi that fixes it. Any ideas which commit might have been the resolution? Or was it a series of changes that would be difficult to backport?. At the jedi_bump branch, it's made a huge difference so far. jsonserver seems to be holding in the 300-400MB range.. The same python process has been running for these past 4 days and it has only grown slightly to 500MB. I'd say that it fixes my issue.. Aaaaand, I jinxed myself. The jsonserver process is currently spinning and growing, but pretty slowly compared to last time. In 4 minutes, it's only at 1.2GB. I couldn't get jsonserver to run in debug mode using jedi_bump, for some reason it would never talk to sublime. I'll try again.. Got jsonserver running in debug mode. I'll post a followup if it starts spinning again in a few days.. Could it be related to different projects using the same virtualenv? I have two related projects that I was using the same virtualenv to edit and test, both projects were open and both were getting linted automatically.\nIn debug mode, you specify a single project and it doesn't appear to do any linting or anything of other projects that are also open using the same virtualenv. I'll try a second debug jsonserver for the other project and see what happens.. I worked for several hours with the two projects open (separate jsonserver process for each) and one of them produced this when it started spinning and growing memory:\nINFO:root:client requests: doc\nReceived method: doc, handler: jedi\n<class 'handlers.jedi_handler.JediHandler'> handler retrieved from registry\n^CTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\", line 376, in <module>\n    server.serve_forever()\n  File \"anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\", line 165, in serve_forever\n    asyncore.loop()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/asyncore.py\", line 216, in loop\n    poll_fun(timeout, map)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/asyncore.py\", line 156, in poll\n    read(obj)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/asyncore.py\", line 83, in read\n    obj.handle_read_event()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/asyncore.py\", line 449, in handle_read_event\n    self.handle_read()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/asynchat.py\", line 165, in handle_read\n    self.found_terminator()\n  File \"anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\", line 105, in found_terminator\n    self.handle_command(handler_type, method, uid, vid, data)\n  File \"anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\", line 132, in handle_command\n    handler(method, data, uid, vid, self.return_back, DEBUG_MODE).run()\n  File \"/data/home/rob/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py\", line 30, in run\n    super(JediHandler, self).run()\n  File \"/data/home/rob/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_server/lib/anaconda_handler.py\", line 48, in run\n    command(**kwargs)\n  File \"/data/home/rob/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py\", line 99, in doc\n    Doc(self.callback, self.uid, self.script, html)\n  File \"/data/home/rob/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_server/commands/doc.py\", line 33, in __init__\n    super(Doc, self).__init__(callback, uid)\n  File \"/data/home/rob/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_server/commands/base.py\", line 14, in __init__\n    self.run()\n  File \"/data/home/rob/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/anaconda/anaconda_server/commands/doc.py\", line 41, in run\n    definitions = self.script.goto_definitions()\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/api/__init__.py\", line 190, in goto_definitions\n    module_node = self._get_module_node()\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/cache.py\", line 89, in wrapper\n    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/api/__init__.py\", line 137, in _get_module_node\n    parser = FastParser(self._grammar, self._source, self.path)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/diff.py\", line 33, in __call__\n    parser.module = parser._parsed = d.update(new_lines)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/diff.py\", line 176, in update\n    self._copy_from_old_parser(line_offset, i2, j2)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/diff.py\", line 230, in _copy_from_old_parser\n    self._parse(until_line_new)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/diff.py\", line 285, in _parse\n    node = self._try_parse_part(until_line)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/diff.py\", line 333, in _try_parse_part\n    return self._active_parser.parse(tokenizer=tokenizer)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/__init__.py\", line 267, in parse\n    root_node = super(ParserWithRecovery, self).parse(self._tokenize(tokenizer))\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/__init__.py\", line 136, in parse\n    self._parsed = self.pgen_parser.parse(tokenizer)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/pgen2/parse.py\", line 123, in parse\n    if self.addtoken(type_, value, start_pos, prefix):\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/pgen2/parse.py\", line 149, in addtoken\n    self.shift(type_, value, newstate, prefix, start_pos)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/pgen2/parse.py\", line 184, in shift\n    newnode = self.convert_leaf(self.grammar, type_, value, prefix, start_pos)\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/parser/__init__.py\", line 184, in convert_leaf\n    if type == tokenize.NAME:\nKeyboardInterrupt\nClearly it's an issue in Jedi but because it can take hours to trigger.

    "ezk84": "The test runner is creating a module path from your project root to your current file and passing that to your test command, (hence the periods in the filename).\nNext question is, is your test module importable from your project root?\n. The problem here is that this feature has been designed most likely by one user to cover their own use case for testing, which happens to be with module paths.\nMaybe you'd like to contribute some code that returns the test file path instead with a way to switch back and forth between these two modes?\n. The changes would have to go around this line in this file.\nLooking at that function, the module path is built from the test_root to the current file. Looking up where test_root is set here it appears to be an undocumented config option named test_root that defaults to the window's current folder.\nSo why not try setting test_root in your project settings to ./sql_tools/ and seeing what happens. You can check which command the test runner tries to run by looking at the ST console Ctrl + `.\n. @nfantone Run into this same problem today and solved it by doing what I suggested above.\nWhat I've found out:\n- test_root defaults to the first open project folder, but you can override it in your .project-settings. This will be the working directory from which your test runner will be executed. CAVEAT: This must be an absolute system path, not relative to your project root.\n- test_project_path is used only when your run all project tests and gets added to the end of your test runner command in that instance.\nSo you will be able to make your scenario work by doing this:\n- Remove test_project_path\n- Set test_root to /full/path/to/project/sql-tools/, assuming sqltool.tests.test_sqltools is importable from this directory.\nComment: This is a rather convoluted situation that deserves better documentation and perhaps even a rethinking of how to cover most use cases in a intuitive way.\n. I have tried this but the delimiter is used to delimit the module from the class name. Here the problem is that the path separator \\ should have been replaced with a . instead. \nI have tracked down the offending line and will issue a PR.\n. ",

I just tested again while looking at the console... There's no exception, error or anything out of the ordinary. Do I have to be in debug mode to see it?\n. Oh, sorry. Just tailed it. All I see are INFO logging msgs, no errors or exceptions of any kind. When I replicate the exact thing you see in the GIF above, I get apparently normal \"client requests: autocomplete\" and the answers (completion options) match what we see in screen in the GIF.\n.

This can be repeated indefinitely. \nIn other words, completion works properly for a couple seconds after jsonserver.py is started.\n. Same exact behavior: No proper completions unless I comment out the import statement in the imported module.\n. I was wondering, it's kind of a big one. Shouldn't we be seeing more people complaining about this? Maybe it doesn't affect all platforms? I'm testing on Linux only.\n. Ok.

I have no idea how no one (including me) noticed it until now.\nAnyway, the problem now is that this is a huge commit, there's a lot to learn and a lot to check. If I had to take a wild guess: I noticed listeners.linting.BackgroundLinter() methods make repeated calls to anaconda_lib.helpers.check_linting(), and if I comment out all those if statements and just make it return True, it seems to kinda improve it. Maybe something is wrong with those bitwise AND flags logic?\n@DamnWidget, any thoughts? Am I close to it? :)\n. That's great Oscar :) I have been working my way through Anaconda's code base for some days and trying many different things with no luck at all. Thank you!. Hi Oscar, there was a tiny typo that caused Anaconda to not be loaded. I submitted a pull request. Other than that, preliminary tests suggest you fixed it. . I installed Sublime Text 3 fresh on a new Ubuntu VM and installed Anaconda via Package Control. I think everything is fine :). Awesome, I'm looking forward to v. 2.0.\nThanks.\n. Sure, no problem. I'm actually investigating other bugs and hopefully will have other pull requests for you soon if I succeed. No rush.\n. I agree with the original report, but the workaround fixed it for me. Here's  a small screencast showing how completion works for me after applying the workaround. Sorry for the low quality: github does not accept video files, had to convert from mkv to gif...\n\n. I don't have a computer with windows, but it's the Linux equivalent:\n~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Python/Completion\\ Rules.tmPreferences\nYes, I restarted sublime after applying the workaround.\nMaybe there's a conflicting package? Which packages do you have (ctrl+shift+p and list packages).\nI have  Anaconda, BracketHighlighter, Color Highlighter, GitGutter, Package Control, Python Improved, requirementstxt, rsub, Seti_UI, SideBarEnhancements, SublimeLinter and Theme - Monokai.\n. Oops, just noticed your file has a xml extension (Completion Rules.tmPreferences.xml), mine has no xml extension (Completion Rules.tmPreferences). \n. Glad it worked :)\n. ",

The fact that GoTo Def. always works the first time (and works for module/package entities) still seems weird but I'll try delving into Anaconda implementation and check its nuts and bolts to clarify this to myself.\n.

I have a project with files under 300 lines each and Anaconda is blazing fast. I tested the pdb.py file from python 3.4 in my project and tried anaconda on it. It is better than before, but there is still a clear lag on the suggestion/documentation.\nI did the following test:\nI tried anaconda on my project files for a couple seconds and tested command such as \"re.\" and \"print\". Everything popped the list of completion immediately. Then I opened the pdb.py file and when I typed \"re.\" the suggestion list took about 2-3 seconds to pop, the same thing happened for \"print\". The argument autocomplete of print took 2-3 second to execute. It executed while I was typing arguments and completed the argument in the middle of my text (creating a mess of my argument values and anaconda default autocompletion).\nIt seems the slowdown happens when we are working in a big file. If I import pdb in one of my short script, the autocomplete runs fine when completing pdb and listing the available function.\nanaconda_jsonserver.txt\n. I did not see much change in the speed on \"pdb.py\".\nanaconda_jsonserver.txt. I might have a better input on what might be happening. I recorded the log while I was typing. The slowdown seems to be in the back and forth when typing.\nIn the first file \"Untitled.py\" I have 1076 line of comment with slash in them (nothing else). When I type the \"import\" keyword it seems to send some data every second after finishing typing.\nIf I go for an empty file it works instantly.

Bingo! It works, thanks a lot for your help!\n. Actually, I think something like SublimeTextXdebug would be ideal, since we do not have any decent debugger for python in Sublime text at this moment. In many cases, I write codes in sublime text and open Pycharm for debugging.  Of course, developing a Xdebug for Python is non-trivial at all, I would be very happy to participate if I had enough time. :disappointed:\nBy the way, @DamnWidget In Golconda, would it includes some built-in debugger?\n. @DamnWidget  I mean, besides auto-completion and refactoring, which you have told us that Anaconda 3 will have better support for, are you going to integrate an advanced debugger as well? \n. Thank you so much for your detailed explanation, looking forward to Anaconda 3!\n. @DamnWidget  The slow way you proposed seems to be doable, but it is very inefficient in the sense that everytime when we make a find_usage call, it will go through every single file again and again.\nMaybe a more plausible way is to use an index cache to record every query that is made by users. Then, when a new query arrives, the system will:\n- Search in the cache, if not, start a new query to every single file and recorded in the cache.\n- If in the cache, get the cached record and,\n- check if recorded files/buffers have been changed, if changed, re-query corresponding files/buffers.\n- check if new file appears, if so, query the new file.\n- update the record and return results to the user.\nThe problem is, in this way (let jedi search every single file and cache it), it is hard to convince myself that this approach has kinds of competitive advantage v.s. ctags.\n. In the source code, find_usage is implemented as follows:\npython\n            location = active_view().rowcol(self.view.sel()[0].begin())\n            data = prepare_send_data(location, 'usages', 'jedi')\n            Worker().execute(\n                Callback(on_success=self.on_success),\n                **data\n            )\nI tracked the Worker class in anaconda_lib/jedi and anaconda_lib/worker. Seems that the data is prepared to send to the jsonserver. How can I only query a particular file, rather than the whole project?\n. Sorry, probably I did not make it clear enough. I just try to find the way in which Anaconda queries Jedi/jsonserver for the usage, could you please advise which library should I look into?\n. What I did just now is to try to understand the mechanism behind find_usages.py. Thanks for mentioning the docs! I did not notice it before. I will have a good look at the document and try to implement a better version of \"find_usage\".\n. @davidhalter Thanks for the clarification. Since it is on the development calendar of Jedi itself, I will wait the update of Jedi then.\n. ",

I use conda environments, and Anaconda does not seem to use the first python that is in the PATH.  . Thanks for the super fast reply.

    "montegoode": "Sure thing. I wonder if that PR is somehow interfering with running tests with virtualenv.\nHere is my original configuration that I've been using for a couple of months:\n\"pylint_rcfile\": \"~/Dropbox/Work/pypond/pypond/pylint.rc\",\n        \"python_interpreter\": \"~/Dropbox/Work/pypond/venv/bin/python\",\n        \"test_before_command\": \"source ~/Dropbox/Work/pypond/venv/bin/activate\",\n        \"test_after_command\": \"deactivate\",\nAfter the update this morning when I start sublime with my launcher (Alfred) and try to invoke the tests (using the anaconda default of nose):\n/bin/bash: nosetests: command not found\n/bin/bash: deactivate: command not found\n[Finished in 0.0s with exit code 127]\n[shell_cmd: source ~/Dropbox/Work/pypond/venv/bin/activate & nosetests  & deactivate]\n[dir: /Users/monte/Dropbox/Work/pypond/pypond]\n[path: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin]\nEven though the virtualenv is being activated, it now can not find nosetests. I've verified that these shell commands work from the command line and nosetests are installed just like they always were. Somehow the path from the activated virtualenv is not getting set or inherited from.\nSo if I kill sublime, start the terminal, activate the virtualenv for my project, and then start sublime with subl and try to run the tests, I get a little farther but still have errors:\n```\n/bin/bash: deactivate: command not found\ncreate a regular Event from datetime, dict. ... ok\n\nRan 1 test in 0.001s\nOK\n[Finished in 0.2s with exit code 127]\n[shell_cmd: source ~/Dropbox/Work/pypond/venv/bin/activate & nosetests tests.event_test:TestRegularEventCreation.test_regular_with_dt_data_key & deactivate]\n[dir: /Users/monte/Dropbox/Work/pypond/pypond]\n[path: /Users/monte/Dropbox/Work/pypond/venv/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin]\n```\nIt is now finding nosetests because it is inheriting the environment from my shell now, but it should be getting it from the activated virutalenv. And now it can't execute deactivate for some reason as well.\nIt looks like the recent change impacted how the test runner is dealing with the environment under the hood so if you're trying to run your tests from a virutualenv instead of a global python installation, it's messed up. Something has definitely changed.\nDoes this help?\n. That worked fine with my pre-existing configuration. Didn't need to launch from the shell with the virtualenv activated, deactivate worked, etc etc. Something in the test runner definitely changed with the 1.4.21 release.\nI also tried using the test_virtualenv directive rather than the before and after ones. It works fine in 1.4.18 but not in the 1.4.21 - same environment problem.\n. @DamnWidget I pulled down 1.4.22 with sublime package control and I'm seeing the same behavior as in 1.4.21:\n/bin/bash: nosetests: command not found\n/bin/bash: deactivate: command not found\n[Finished in 0.0s with exit code 127]\n[shell_cmd: source ~/Dropbox/Work/pypond/venv/bin/activate & nosetests tests.event_test & deactivate]\n[dir: /Users/monte/Dropbox/Work/pypond/pypond]\n[path: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin]\nI'm not sure what is different between .18 and .21. I can't tell if either 1) the virtualenv is not being activated (it looks like it is from the shell_cmd traceback however) or 2) if the virtualenv is being activated and the new environment is somehow not being inherited? The traceback is showing that the virtualenv is not being added to the path.\nI know that interacting with the virtualenv still works - I set the python_interpreter directive to point at a virtualenv to among other things run pylint which works fine. This behavior is impacting the test runner only.\n. @DamnWidget That did the trick!\n. ",

There still is a case, where I get 2 identical locations when using \"Anaconda: Goto object definition\" command.\nI'm not sure exactly how to reproduce this in jedi shell, but it is plausible the cause is multiple definitions returned for a given completion.follow_definition(). It is this completion object's method that I'm attempting to follow.\nThe dupe definition returned seems to be caused by having a conditional import statement (try import OneClass, except import AnotherClass), where both classes imported are eventually initiated and assigned to same symbol in the module.\nRegardless, I now feel my first instinct was correct, I think Anaconda should consider this (entirely legitimate) scenario and remove any dupe entries. I would consider duplicates entries that have all of the following exactly equal:\n- same path string\n- same line and same row\n@DamnWidget what do you say?\n. Yes, in theory, but,we're talking about a lookup for len(matches) > 1, I can't imagine that will happen often, and if it does it will be 3 conditions checked, maybe a single digit number of times ... I wouldn't call that performance overhead, only code complexity.\nFor me personally, it seems a simple choice, since I waste another key-press every time I follow those dupe objects. I will try patching it and work with it a while; if all is well, I'll submit a PR by the weekend.\n. @DamnWidget you are correct, I neglected to mention that in my case the conditional imports are of classes that share common ancestor class, which means that both \"re-use\" some methods; which leads to both being resolved to the same definition.\nJust tried the branch: works perfectly!

If you add support for a pluggable linters then I'm sold \ud83d\udc4d  !\n. I love the idea of this PR in general, but I would take a different approach to implementation, separating the pipenv functionality from the core functions of Anaconda.\nPerhaps we can start with just adding a few useful commands:\n\npipenv: configure env path: find the pipenv virtualenv path and add it to project settings (prompting to overwrite if the key exists)?\npipenv: install a package: prompt to install new packages (single or list of comma/space separated packages) into the env.\npipenv: install: install all the packages in the Pipfile.\n\nI'm going to experiment and if it looks good I'll submit a good PR. @. Soz for the delay, was out with kid.\nI'm using python 3.6.4 and goto doesn't work to anything in the environment that is outside of current project dir (i.e for any package in site-packages of the virtual environment).  I use the project setting python_interpreter to point to the python3 binary in my venv.\nNote that goto to local packages (in project dir) works fine. I updated the ticket to include these details; OS and other details are already mentioned in the ticket.\n@DamnWidget does goto work fine for you when using virtual environment? How do you define the interpreter to use?. Just looking at the changelog of Jedi, it seems release 0.12.1 (2018-06-30) mentions that using parso < 0.3 is going to break everything (?) and the jedi_0_12 branch is using version 0.2.1.

You should be able to have one mypy, tox or flake8 installed for the whole system.\nMaybe anaconda should provide a fallback mypy install in case it's not importable, or at least offer to install it in the virtualenv if it detects it's not.\n.

Here is what I get:\n\n\n```\nMyPy error: No library stub file for module 'django.http'\nMyPy note: (Stub files are from https://github.com/python/typeshed)\nMyPy error: No library stub file for module 'django.db'\nMyPy error: No library stub file for module 'django.contrib.auth.models'\nMyPy error: No library stub file for module 'django.conf'\nMyPy error: No library stub file for module 'django.db.models.signals'\nMyPy error: No library stub file for module 'django.dispatch'\nMyPy error: No library stub file for module 'django.db.models'\nMyPy error: No library stub file for module 'django_extensions.db.models'\nMyPy error: Need type annotation for variable\n```\n. Just tried it. It works, but seems to shift the position of the next visible warning gutters.\nLe 31/08/2016 \u00e0 17:51, Oscar Campos a \u00e9crit :\n\nClosed #522 https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/522 via\nf217f81\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/commit/f217f814c56ec81c4be890bcf9e634faafc96ca3.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/522#event-773865933, or\nmute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABmK3mf6u1JEkPvRvEmhMRyJX3u96xr6ks5qlaMbgaJpZM4JxZC2.\n. I have exactly the same behaviour, on the latest Sublime version, but on Ubuntu.\n\nThe error is slightly different since it's using posixpath instead of ntpath but in it's basically identical:\nFile \"/home/user/Scripts/stow/home_dotfiles/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib/workers/interpreter.py\", line 129, in __extract_paths\n    extra = get_settings(view, 'extra_paths', [])\n  File \"/home/user/Scripts/stow/home_dotfiles/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib/helpers.py\", line 257, in get_settings\n    r = os.path.expanduser(os.path.expandvars(r))\n  File \"./python3.3/posixpath.py\", line 252, in expanduser\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'startswith'\nThe problem comes from the fact that the variable r contains a list here:\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/blob/master/anaconda_lib/helpers.py#L256\nThe last update added that line:\nhttps://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/commit/1d52726fb55f03da9626048822691794ef21c4b2#diff-19aa897b833995404fa88d3dbc5fa8a7\nI tried to replace it with:\nr = [os.path.expanduser(os.path.expandvars(v)) for v in r]\nBut then got:\nFile \"/home/user/Scripts/stow/home_dotfiles/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib/workers/interpreter.py\", line 185, in __parse_raw_interpreter\n    urldata = urlparse(self.__raw_interpreter)\n  File \"./python3.3/urllib/parse.py\", line 292, in urlparse\n  File \"./python3.3/urllib/parse.py\", line 112, in _coerce_args\n  File \"./python3.3/urllib/parse.py\", line 96, in _decode_args\n  File \"./python3.3/urllib/parse.py\", line 96, in <genexpr>\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'decode'\nSo the error is probably deeper than just a line added.\nNow what's worries me is that this error probably broke ALL anaconda setup with automatic updates. Which means the project has no basic unit test to prevent releasing something that is not completely broken. It's usually a bad thing, but with auto-update, it's especially bad.\nAs much as I like anaconda, it's not the first time I have to spent half an hour to figure out why it's not working anymore. Can I make a donation somewhere to help you so you can spend more time on code quality ?\nAnyway, for people looking for a quick workaround while waiting for a fix, open sublime_folder/Packages/Anaconda/helpers.py, and replace the line 257 with return r.\n.

Then you should have a look at [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) \u2013 it's a lot smaller that the full blown Anaconda Python Distribution, and it doesn't require you to register (I installed in this way).\nAnd the distribution comes with it's own package manager and virtual-environment-manager, Conda \u2013 hope it makes checking the problem easyier :)\n.

When working in a Jupyter notebook, it's sometimes convenient to copy-paste code between ST and the notebook, when it's in need of heavy editing, but the massive amount of warnings (missing imports and such), makes the code difficult to read.\nSince the code is linted, I suspect at Anaconda / Jedi is able to treat the unsaved buffer as a file, so consider this a feature request to add support for disabling linting on an unsaved buffer :)\n. I'd probably like to look into this after my upcoming exams, provided that the codebase isn't too complex, as to allow me to do this in a reasonable amount of time \u2013 will write here after my exams :)\n.

It looks like this server doesn't use unix_socket and works for now.\nFurther edit: The unix_socket module is in the directory above the jsonserver, so running the server from there works fine in Python 3. The server will not automatically start correctly though, and I'm having some issues figuring out which entry point I need to look at for this part. As a workaround, I've set jsonserver_debug to true for the time being and use my own when I need it. It would be nice to have this automated again though.. @DamnWidget I was running the jsonserver.py file from within anaconda/anaconda_server so it couldn't find unix_socket. My bad there. I restored the file and am still having issues with the server automatically starting though. Any ideas on an entry point for debugging this? I've found 3-4 places in the code that look like they start JsonServers up but I haven't been able to properly debug it because I don't know where my print messages or logging statements go, and the issue can't be produced by running the server in debug mode (which fixes the problem entirely).\nFor what it's worth, I can only start the server with python3 while the default python in my path is python2.7.13, because of syntax that you used in the code. I don't think this should be an issue because the python3.3 that ST3 ships with should be capable of running the server .. I was typing this and decided to test what happens if I set the default python in my path to python3 and it fixed the problem. I was under the impression that ST3 uses its own python rather than my system one. I've had python point to python2 for the last six months and it hasn't been a problem with ST3 or anaconda, only had issues today.. anyways, the end discovery is that anaconda requires python3. Is there an easy way for me to make anaconda use it while letting my default python use python2?\nEDIT: I see that I can set anaconda to use a specific python interpreter in your configure anaconda the right way documentation. Thank you for making this. You can consider my problem as solved! No idea why it broke in the first place but that's OK.. The reason it was breaking for me with python2.7 is because of this:\n```\n\npython\npython\nPython 2.7.13 (default, Dec 18 2016, 07:03:39)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\npython -B anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\", line 32, in \n    from handlers import ANACONDA_HANDLERS\n  File \"/Users/cody/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/init.py\", line 9, in \n    from .jedi_handler import JediHandler\n  File \"/Users/cody/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_server/handlers/jedi_handler.py\", line 8, in \n    import jedi\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/init.py\", line 41, in \n    from jedi.api import Script, Interpreter, NotFoundError, set_debug_function\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/api/init.py\", line 25, in \n    from jedi.api import classes\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/api/classes.py\", line 15, in \n    from jedi.evaluate.cache import memoize_default, CachedMetaClass\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/evaluate/init.py\", line 69, in \n    from jedi.evaluate import representation as er\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/evaluate/representation.py\", line 52, in \n    from jedi.evaluate import docstrings\n  File \"anaconda_lib/jedi/evaluate/docstrings.py\", line 44, in \n    from numpydoc.docscrape import NumpyDocString\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpydoc/init.py\", line 5, in \n    from .numpydoc import setup\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpydoc/numpydoc.py\", line 31, in \n    from .docscrape_sphinx import get_doc_object, SphinxDocString\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpydoc/docscrape_sphinx.py\", line 14, in \n    from sphinx.jinja2glue import BuiltinTemplateLoader\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sphinx/jinja2glue.py\", line 20, in \n    from typing import Any, Callable, Iterator, Tuple  # NOQA\n  File \"anaconda_lib/typing.py\", line 98\n    def new(cls, name, bases, namespace, , _root=False):\n                                              ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n``\nThe caret in the last line points to the comma after.

I'm fairly certain that anaconda's python interpreter is the same one that I used in my tests above. If you were talking about anaconda the platform, I don't use that - I just use python installed from Homebrew. I think I see what you mean though, as it looks like it's importing fromanaconda_lib/typing.pyinstead of my systemtyping` module. How can I fix this?\n\nedit: I went into the Anaconda/anaconda_lib directory and started up a python session:\n```\n\npwd\n.../Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Anaconda/anaconda_lib\nipython\nIn [1]: import typing\n  File \"typing.py\", line 98\n    def new(cls, name, bases, namespace, *, _root=False):\n                                              ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n``\nso this confirms that it's trying to useanaconda_lib/typing.py.. @bjarchi workaround is what I described above: patch theanaconda_lib/jedi/evaluate/docstrings.py` file where I mentioned two comments ago.\n\nthis prevents it from trying to import typing unless you're using python3. ",
    "bjarchi": "I ran into the same issue as @codyhan94 - jsonserver was failing to launch due to that exact same issue with typing under homebrew python2 (2.7.13). An interesting discovery - launching the jsonserver from a terminal fails using brewed python 2.7, but succeeds using system python 2.7 (2.7.10) with the exact same arguments. \nIn my case my path is set through .zshrc, which doesn't seem to be picked up by ST/anaconda, so I had to manually set \"python_interpreter\" to /usr/local/bin/python to get proper discovery of installed packages with brewed python. After clearing that setting value in my user (global) config file for anaconda, the jsonserver once again successfully starts - but apparently this is using the bundled interpreter with ST3 as sys.version reports 3.3.6. Unfortunately when I set \"python_interpreter\" to brewed python (2.7) in a project file this once again causes the jsonserver to fail to start.\nSo two questions: is the fact that the jsonserver properly starts (in debug mode at least) with system python 2.7 a red herring in this case? Is it useful at all in debugging the jsonserver startup problem with homebrew python? And, is there a workaround I can use until the next release that will allow me to use my brewed python 2.7 with anaconda without having to manually start the server before starting ST3? \nThanks for the great development environment!\n. @DamnWidget Can confirm that v2.1.20 - latest in package control now - seems to have fixed the server startup error w/ python2 including homebrew python. \nThanks!.

    "DP2004": "Update: Nevermind, I had a focus error, still getting the problem :(\nOriginal Post\nI might have some details that could help with this issue. I recently did a clean install of sublime 3 and after installing the plugins anaconda stopped working with the same symptoms listed here. I would get the popup on startup and the console would keep repeating the same message. I checked my processes and I do see a sporadic python process started but it always terminated very quickly. When I checked the log file I noticed that it was filled with client requests: lint and client requests: doc printouts. As this was the only input in the log file I disabled linting in anaconda on a whim and sure enough the printouts in the console went away and I did not get the popup when starting sublime. \nI also have SublimeLinter-pep8 installed and enabled in my project settings. I removed this plugin and re-enabled linting in anaconda and did not receive the error any more. \nIn my case it seemed like this was caused by the two plugins not playing nice. Has anyone else noticed anything similar?. I finally was able to resolve my issue and have been using anaconda successfully for about a month. Based on the previous comments in this thread I assumed it was a problem with my configuration of python and sublime. In order to resolve that I removed anaconda from my plugins, uninstalled sublime, then uninstalled python. After that was done I went through my registry and deleted any key I could find that mentioned python or sublime. After doing that I reinstalled python, then sublime, and added anaconda. Probably a bit overkill but it seemed to work and I have not seen this issue since finishing this process. . ",

    "evandrocoan": "Well, there is a bad option which can be done while the issue https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1095 on the Sublime Text core is not closed/finished.\n1. When we are on no python projects, we delete the Context menu file.\n2. When we are on python projects, we write the Context menu file down.\n. Hi, \n\nBecause I we need to rename the file Context.sublime-menu to some else as Base Context.sublime-menu, then on plugin_loaded() we copy it or to Context.sublime-menu or Context.sublime-menu-hidden. So when upgrading the file Context.sublime-menu we only need to change the Base Context.sublime-menu. Also, would be a pain with git as both files Context.sublime-menu and Context.sublime-menu-hidden are constantly changing their names. We would be a lot of, a) the fine is missing now, b) the file is not missing now.\nI think I can, but a better solution would be writing a dedicated package to handle this for all other packages. For now I am short of time, so unless I am really required to write a package as for performance loss due too much threads being created. For example, the other related packages as https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda_rust/blob/master/Context.sublime-menu also has the menu entry, so if use them I would need to include this there too, which seems not nice to be doing around.\n\nBut perhaps we should just wait Sublime Text core implement this as a built-in feature:\n\nhttps://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1859 Allow to hide .sublime-menu folders. Ok, however the phantoms always show up. Which is horrible. They show only appear when I select the line or hovers it. Following this, the Sublime Text pop up could be used instead of phantoms:\n\n\n. I fixed this by using https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server with https://github.com/tomv564/LSP which already has this implemented.. I do not understand is the tasklist process still running,  the tasklist process is not hanged, it is spamming every few seconds:\n\n\n. I opened the file:\npython\nFile: Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\n194:         self.delta = 300\nAnd set the delta from delta to 300 in hope it will stop spamming on the future.. I answered your question:\n\nthe tasklist process is not hanged\n\nOf course I run it form the command line. It just outputs all my running processes. So it is again not hanged.. >  it just calls that windows command to know if ST3 is still running in your system or not\nThat is the problem, calling it every few seconds to know whether Sublime Text is running or not. My process monitor shows all system process running, therefore all Anaconda calls to tasklist will show up. I never had any program which did such thing. \nAfter this change:\npython\nFile: Anaconda/anaconda_server/jsonserver.py\n194:         self.delta = 300\nThe issue seems to be fixed.. > I asked you if you could run tasklist from your terminal to see how it behaves and you answered with more images that are useless, if you are not willing to follow simple instructions and give me results I am afraid that I can not give you any support.\nPlease give clear instructions if you want me to understand. Saying:\n\nWhy is the tasklist process still running? Can you try to run tasklist from a CMD.exe or Powershell to see if it hangs?\n\nIs everything but not clear on about what you want to know.. Thanks for the patience, and sorry for my uncleanness.\n\nYou should not see any tasklist process as the process should return as soon as it runs (just as when you run it in the terminal).\n\nUse Process Hacker (http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/) to manage and monitor my processes. I configured it to show all closed process for at least 600.000 milliseconds.\n\nwhat it means that the background is red?\n\nSo, when I process exists, it background on Process Hacker is show in the red color. I using this to know what processes were running on my machine some time in the past. I use this to spot processes which ran but should not, or are just eating my resources/CPU for no reason.\nNow, if Anaconda server launches/spawn a new tasklist process each 3 or 5 seconds, it will leave a huge trail of dead processes on my list which remember the dead process for 600.000 milliseconds. The animation above shows the tasklist process being launch (green color background) and when they die, their background became red (red color background). So they are pilling up dead process every few seconds.\n\nif you run tasklist yourself, do you see a lot of other tasklist processes running as well?\n\nIt just shows the list of running processes:\n```\n$ tasklist\nImage Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage\n========================= ======== ================ =========== ============\nSystem Idle Process              0 Services                   0          8 K\nSystem                           4 Services                   0        980 K\n...\n```.

I had my $PYTHONPATH set to /usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/:/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/, which probably messed with how sys.path was set pretty hard.

Once a .py file is opened Sublime Text is repeatedly throwing error messages unless it is closed. \nMy PYTHONPATH=C:\\caffe\\python;C:\\caffe\\python\\caffe\n. The issue was exactly identical to the one described in the first post by Elliot2560. First I got this:\n\nThenafter an infinite loop of dialog boxes stating that Python has crashed. \nHowever - I checked my PYTHONPATH. The second directory exists but it does not contain any modules so I removed it. Surprisingly the infinite loop is gone.

I was just trying to be funny. Sorry that you didn't find the humor in it. I thought I was being nice. To be fair, the error didn't make sense, still doesn't even after I read the docs. I have a valid python interpreter on my PATH, why wasn't it found? Also why twice?  Maybe add that exact error message to the docs so that when someone does a search for that they end up there. I'm surprised that the default didn't work, python is on my path, \u00af\\(\u30c4)/\u00af \nSorry to be a bother, I meant no harm. Also keep in mind being nice is free, even when you feel others are not. \ud83d\ude04. Oh I just realized, it's my avatar, it's kind of an angry face, maybe that set the tone.. I updated the Global settings, set the python_interpreter to the absolute path of mine, /usr/local/opt/pyenv/shims/python. That didn't seem to make a difference. I did then also set the auto_python_builder_enabled to false which maybe did the trick. I don't have any User settings at all and I don't use Projects yet for anything either. So that should be the only settings consulted.. unless the lack of settings at those stages unsets the global setting, but that doesn't seem plausible, right?\nYes, tone is hard to read, which is why I always (try to) assume the best possible intent. Apply that to reading online things and kids for improved happiness. It can be hard when there is an avatar with teeth bared staring you down..

What happens when you type in the same command? Does it stay up throughout the parameter list, or no?\nAnd is there any chance that the auto-complete is making it disappear?  That's at the precise moment that it happens.  As soon as auto-complete happens, the popup goes away.\n\nIf you really want to be able to see the signatures I recommend you to disable the signatures popup, anaconda will show you the signatures in the status bar instead, to do so, you can set the option enable_signatures_tooltip as false in the configuration.\n\nThat works up until the point that some PEP error over-writes the status bar text.  This is not usable.  Also it doesn't show the docstring.  I'd really like to get the signature popup working, even if that means re-installing everything or chasing an upstream bug / misfeature with the writers of Sublime Text.\n. Thanks for the quick replies.\n\nDid you try to enable complete_parameters? I think that will do wonders for your use case.\n\nI did.  Will probably take some time to see if I can get used to it or not.  It does give me the list of parameters which is cool.  However it doesn't help with the problem of displaying docstrings and default function parameters after the function call has been written.  So I'm still not back to where I was before this functionality broke.  I do recall that it worked fine a few months back.\nPer my previous question, what is the default behavior?  Is this a problem for everyone right now?  Or just me?. No worries, that answers my question at least.  I'm only vaguely familiar with the Sublime Text API at this point so I probably won't be of much help.\nHowever being that it's a pretty annoying bug to me, I will probably post over at the Sublime Text forum and see if their dev team has any ideas.  I'll point them to your repo.  If they can tell me what's causing it, I can make the change and submit a pull request.. @DamnWidget I've created a post over at the Sublime Text forums, detailing this problem.  I'm hoping that someone there can shed some light on what's causing the issue, and if it can be fixed.\nhttps://forum.sublimetext.com/t/signatures-popup-disappears-after-typing-any-parameter-text/26005\nWould you be able to keep this issue open until I can get some answers there?. @DamnWidget, just wanted to stop by and say thank you for fixing this issue so quick.  I got to work this morning to find that my machine had ran out of memory and crashed a few open programs.  Was headed here to file a bug report and just saw the upgrade message in Sublime Text.\nI've already gotten a crash within the IDE since the upgrade was applied, which might be related.  I'll comment here with steps to reproduce if I get any further issues.. ",

I have been using mypy nightly since putting this together and have some further changes. Bit of a mess at the moment but should be able to sort out. I'll open a new pr and continue to tweak it until the next mypy release. :). Rebase is done. :)\nEDIT no it isn't, mucked something up there.\nEDIT2: should be right now.\nI'm aware that this would force mypy users to update, and was a little hesitant over it as well. However, I would guess that almost all mypy users are going to have it installed from pip anyway, in which case upgrading is a simple pip install -U mypy away. Would a simple version check with an error in the Sublime status bar saying \"Please update your version of MyPy\" be enough to avoid issues getting raised over this?\nI would actually be more worried about the removal of support for running MyPy when Anaconda is running in Python 2, as this is something users potentially have less control over. As I said above though, I would be very surprised if this was a common case (I guess the only scenario is ST2 users who have a Python >=3.4 runtime on their system and have chosen to use MyPy from pip while not upgrading to ST3).\nConversely, without this PR, current Anaconda does not support new mypy, as they've changed their CLI parameters (again).\nIf you really think it is worth it, I could implement new MyPy support in a class alongside the existing MyPy class in linting/anaconda_mypy.py. Personally I don't think the added complexity is worth the gain, (see ease of users upgrading their MyPy installations above) but it's your project. :). Just to make sure I understand you, do  you mean that it's common in Arch and Manjaro to have MyPy installed with the system package manager?. E.g. pacman install pymagic depends on mypy, but user has done pip install mypy, and pacman-mypy and pip-mypy both try to install to the same location, and hence will conflict?. ",

    "mg979": "Ok thanks, in the meanwhile I made a toggle function just in case. I don't know if it's easily doable, but the way I'd like this sort of things to work is by having complete_parameters disabled (no autocomplete), but being able to launch the autocomplete function with Tab in the right place. For instance, you get the function tooltip if you type something that Anaconda recognizes as a function. Whenever it's that case, if pressing Tab would call the autocomplete function, that would be perfect, you call it when you really need it and it wouldn't interfere. Anyway no problem if you're working on another project. Should I close this issue or can you do it too (sorry, new to GitHub)?. Ok, some days ago I tried to call that function manually (anaconda_complete_funcargs) but I couldn't, can you tell me if there is an easy way to call it?. I can't get it to work sorry, I tried that, also with a keybinding.. ok thanks, I'll try to find a solution. This should do it (try it with complete_parameters=false):\nclass AnacondaFuncargsKeyListener(sublime_plugin.EventListener):\n    \"\"\"Allows parameters autocompletion with key press\n    \"\"\"\n    Key = 'anaconda_ready_for_funcargs'\n\n    def on_text_command(self, view: sublime.View,\n                    command_name='anaconda_doc', args=None):\n       if view.is_popup_visible():\n          view.settings().set(self.Key, True)\n          view.set_status(self.Key, 'Anaconda: Tab')\n       elif view.settings().get(self.Key):\n          view.settings().set(self.Key, False)\n          view.erase_status(self.Key)\n\n    def on_modified(self, view):\n       if view.settings().get(self.Key):\n          if (view.substr(view.sel()[0].begin() - 1) == '(' and view.substr(\n                view.sel()[0].begin()) == ')'):\n                    pass\n          else:\n             view.settings().set(self.Key, False)\n             view.erase_status(self.Key)\n\n\nclass AnacondaFillFuncargs(sublime_plugin.TextCommand):\n    \"\"\"Triggers parameters autocompletion with key press\n    \"\"\"\n    def run(self, edit):\n       Key = 'anaconda_ready_for_funcargs'\n       self.view.settings().set('complete_parameters', True)\n       self.view.settings().set(Key, False)\n       self.view.erase_status(Key)\n       self.view.run_command(\"anaconda_complete_funcargs\")\n       self.view.settings().set('complete_parameters', False)\n\nKey binding:\n{ \"keys\": [\"tab\"],                \"command\": \"anaconda_fill_funcargs\", \"context\": [{\"key\": \"setting.anaconda_ready_for_funcargs\", \"operator\": \"equal\", \"operand\": true }]},\n\nJust for testing, it shows a status message when it's ready for the function, it can be removed if you think there are no problems. I didn't make a pull request because I don't know where to put the code. It would be maybe best if associated to a setting (like 'anaconda_complete_with_key') so that the listener only runs when the setting is true AND when complete_parameters is false(to avoid running them together), but I don't know how to do that (I'm a beginner, sorry). You can tell me if you like the solution.. I used a setting instead of a variable because I can check it in the context of the hotkey, otherwise I couldn't use tab as hotkey, i'd need something specific for it. You can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it's possible for a keybinding to check for a variable. This is the solution used by AutoSelect plugin and others like Tabr that use a setting. What's the disadvantage of using a setting instead of a variable anyway? You don't even need it in the settings file, it applies in memory to the current view only. It's a matter of performance? Anyway I can't see a solution with a variable.. Thanks, I have to get the hang with listeners, the setting solution looks a bit easier, is there a reason to prefer on_query_context? To be honest I don't even understand what it does, I will dig a bit about it. Is there a precise advantage using it though, or just a different method to achieve the same effect? Thanks for the patience.. Ok, thank you, I'll try to understand better how on_query_context works and make a bit of practice with it... Checking Tabr, I found out it also uses on_query_context, but in a simpler way, so I adapted it a bit and it works ok... The difference is also that it doesn't check for AnacondaDoc, just for a popup, but it's irrelevant I think. How does it look to you? And thanks for the assistance\nclass AnacondaFuncargsKeyListener(sublime_plugin.EventListener):\n    \"\"\"Allows parameters autocompletion with key press\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def on_query_context(self, view, key, operator, operand, match_all):\n\n        def checkpos():\n            if (view.substr(pos - 1) == '(' and view.substr(pos) == ')'):\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n\n        if key == 'anaconda_ready_for_funcargs':\n            if view.is_popup_visible():\n                pos = view.sel()[0].begin()\n                return checkpos()\n\n        return False\n\n\nclass AnacondaFillFuncargs(sublime_plugin.TextCommand):\n    \"\"\"Triggers parameters autocompletion with key press\n    \"\"\"\n    def run(self, edit):\n        self.view.settings().set('complete_parameters', True)\n        self.view.settings().set('anaconda_ready_for_funcargs', False)\n        self.view.run_command(\"anaconda_complete_funcargs\")\n        self.view.settings().set('complete_parameters', False)\n\nwith key:\n{ \"keys\": [\"tab\"],                      \"command\": \"anaconda_fill_funcargs\", \"context\": [{\"key\": \"anaconda_ready_for_funcargs\"}]},\n\n. Well thanks, those operators is what I didn't understand, I'll have to look for examples.\nThis line:\nself.view.settings().set('anaconda_ready_for_funcargs', False)\n\nI forgot it, it should be deleted, but without setting complete_parameters on and off, it doesn't work at all, I have the impression that the command anaconda_complete_funcargs doesn't run if that setting isn't true at least temporary. Also I don't think it would get written to global preferences file, just to workspace/session file because it's a view setting, but only when you quit sublime, I don't think it's a problem. Well good work with Golconda, I have some plugin project I'll be finishing soon, and some more on the todo list. Still learning most of the stuff. Thanks!. Hi, sorry if I left abruptly the conversation, I was a bit busy, if you're going to add a fix you could also add these lines:\nclass AnacondaFillFuncargs(sublime_plugin.TextCommand):\n    \"\"\"Triggers parameters autocompletion with key press\n    \"\"\"\n    def run(self, edit, all=False):\n        self.view.settings().set('complete_parameters', True)\n        if all:\n            self.view.settings().set('complete_all_parameters', True)\n        self.view.run_command(\"anaconda_complete_funcargs\")\n        self.view.settings().set('complete_parameters', False)\n        if all:\n            self.view.settings().set('complete_all_parameters', False)\n\nand 2 keybindings:\n{ \"keys\": [\"tab\"],                      \"command\": \"anaconda_fill_funcargs\", \"context\": [{\"key\": \"anaconda_ready_for_funcargs\"}]},\n{ \"keys\": [\"ctrl+tab\"],                      \"command\": \"anaconda_fill_funcargs\", \"args\": {\"all\": true}, \"context\": [{\"key\": \"anaconda_ready_for_funcargs\"}]},\n\nso that you can choose how many arguments to snip in.

Thanks. Are you interested in a sort of Pydoc browser? It looks like this for now:\n\nIf you are interested, maybe you can give me some tips on how to let it recognize and imported function in Anaconda, and maybe point me to the parts of your code that handle this behaviour?\nYour tooltips can do this(they show the documentation for imported functions, eg if you make from os import path, then path will trigger the tooltip). For now I need to pass the whole module+function string to get a result, it's not ideal.. Thanks, I will check the listener. It wouldn't be something activated automatically like a tooltip, only through command palette or keybinding, that's how I'm using it for now.. Pretty much the feature is described here.. I moved this above, together with the other display-related stuff. Not sure if it's all correct, you can say. The listener checks for:\n  - setting in preferences\n  - scope(must be in function)\n  - position(must be right between empty brackets)\n. Keybindings also check for python selector. The command temporarily changes settings, then restores the original value, in the meantime runs the main command.. change this to:\nif allow and check and 'meta.function' in scope:\nfor Python3 compatibility. check for both scopes. get_settings used.

I think the python progress which takes high occupancy of CPU is related to the JsonServer.py. Because after I kill this progress,the python -B anaconda_server/jsonserver.py -p test 9999 DEBUG will be shut down in the terminal immediately.. Is this tradeback in the terminal that you need? Or should I provide anything else?. ```python\n\n\n\nimport sys\nprint(sys.stdin)\nNone\n.python\nimport sys\nsys.stdin\n\n\n\nnothing :). May I ask what's the meaning of `teh connection`?. I run the test.py, codes in it:python\nimport sys\nprint(sys.stdin)\nresults in Pycharm:python\n\"E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python\\python.exe\" E:/Code/Python/Pycharmprojects/Learning/code/liaoxuefeng/test.py\n<_io.TextIOWrapper name='' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>\nresults in ST3:python\n<_io.TextIOWrapper name='' mode='r' encoding='cp936'>\n[Finished in 0.1s]\n``. Thanks! This works fine for me.So far,I have found the reason:I build my own build-system for Python,encoing=cp936.I change it back to the default Python build-system,and so far nothing seems weird.Really thanks @DamnWidget ,hope ST3 and Anaconda become better!. \u5411\u54b1\u4eec\u56fd\u4eba\u63d0\u4e2a\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\u5343\u4e07\u4e0d\u8981\u968f\u4fbf\u4f7f\u7528\u7f51\u4e0a\u7684ST3\u7684Python\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e2a\u5751\uff0c\u6211\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5c31\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9ebb\u70e6\u4e86\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd9\u4e48\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8870~~~. Haha, I want to remind my compatriots who encounter similar problems to watch the encoding :)\nAnd in Chinese, \u8c22\u8c22 means thank you. Anaconda is really a great ST3 plugin and you are such a nice developer. Hope I can become a programmer like you, sharing the open source beauty.. Very glad to have your reply, sir.Maybe It's inaccurate to say \"statements\".\nWhat I really mean is that when I create an instance of an object class,likepts=numpy.array([[10,5],[20,30],[70,20],could I access the instance's method with a dot.?\n For example, a ndarray object has methods likereshape,resizeand so on.When I typepts.`, I want anaconda to pop the possible methods, statements or constants for me to choose. But it failed. Moreover, I find it really takes seconds for Anaconda to pop potential methods, classes or else of a module at the first time in a single py file. When it gets over at the first time, it will be really good at the second time,the third time....... So I want to ask how to improve the speed of anaconda's first trying to pop? My english is not very good,so if you are still confused ,I will upload a GIF.I will test other modules, when I have time, I will upload more details. I will close this issue on proper time.\nBy the way, Thank you again for your reply.I love Anaconda, it's such a nice plugin.In fact ,I am learning ROS, which doesn't have an IDE.So I use ST3+Anaconda to build something like that, though there is still some problems..

    "rafaelbco": "Here's what I've found. Keep in mind I'm on Python 2.7.\nWhen I run pydocstyle from the command line (the same version included in Anaconda), the problem does not occurs.\nDigging in the code, I found out Anaconda use the method checker.ConventionChecker.check_source as the entry point to pydocstyle. However it passes an unicode object as the first argument. When calling pydocstyle from the command line it passes an str. \nLater on, the source code ends up being processed by the parser.Parser.parse method. And it uses the builtin compile to check if it's valid Python code. \nThis is where things get interesting: compile raises an error if you pass an unicode with an encoding declaration. But with one caveat: it does not detects encoding declarations properly. I wrote this program:\n```\np1 = \"\"\"# coding = utf8\\nprint 1\"\"\"\np2 = \"\"\"# coding=utf8\\nprint 1\"\"\"\nprograms = [p1, p2]\nprograms.extend(p.decode('utf8') for p in list(programs))\nfor p in programs:\n    try:\n        print 'Compiling program {}'.format(repr(p))\n        compile(p, 'p.py', 'exec')\n        print 'Ok!'\n    except SyntaxError as e:\n        print 'Error: {}'.format(e)\n```\nAnd it gives the following output:\nCompiling program '# coding = utf8\\nprint 1'\nOk!\nCompiling program '# coding=utf8\\nprint 1'\nOk!\nCompiling program u'# coding = utf8\\nprint 1'\nOk!\nCompiling program u'# coding=utf8\\nprint 1'\nError: encoding declaration in Unicode string (p.py, line 0)\nTo be consistent both the unicode program strings should have raised an error. It would make our problem worse though, since more styles of encoding declarations would cause problems.\nSo, to fix the problem we have two options: strip encoding declaration before feeding it in to pydocstyle or encode the unicode containg the source code, transforming it to str. \nI prefer the second approach, since pydocstyle itself does not work with unicode when used standalone.\n. Closing because I misunderstood a few things in my analysis. Will open a new issue.. Here's what I've found.\nI'm using Python 2.7. I suspect this bug does not occurs with Python 3. See bellow why.\nWhen I run pydocstyle from the command line (the same version included in Anaconda), the problem does not occurs.\nDigging in the code, I found that Anaconda uses the method checker.ConventionChecker.check_source as the entry point to pydocstyle. It passes an unicode object as the first argument. When calling pydocstyle from the command line, however, it passes an str. This argument contains the source code to be checked. This difference is the source of the bug.\nLater on, the source code ends up being processed by the parser.Parser.parse method. It uses the builtin compile to check if it's valid Python code. Turns out compile raises an error if you pass an unicode with an encoding declaration.\nTo verify this I wrote this program:\n```\np1 = b\"\"\"print(1)\"\"\"\np2 = b\"\"\"# coding=utf8\\nprint(1)\"\"\"\nprograms = [p1, p2]\nprograms.extend(p.decode('utf8') for p in list(programs))\nfor p in programs:\n    try:\n        print('Compiling program {}'.format(repr(p)))\n        compile(p, 'p.py', 'exec')\n        print('Ok!')\n    except SyntaxError as e:\n        print('Error: {}'.format(e))\n```\nRunning with Python 2.7.12 gives the following output:\nCompiling program 'print(1)'\nOk!\nCompiling program '# coding=utf8\\nprint(1)'\nOk!\nCompiling program u'print(1)'\nOk!\nCompiling program u'# coding=utf8\\nprint(1)'\nError: encoding declaration in Unicode string (p.py, line 0)\nWith Python 3.5.2 the result is Ok! for all the 4 programs. That's why I think this issue does not affect Anaconda with Python 3.\nThe most robust fix I can think of is (untested!):\n```\ngit --no-pager diff\ndiff --git a/anaconda_lib/linting/anaconda_pep257.py b/anaconda_lib/linting/anaconda_pep257.py\nindex 593e081..fe228fe 100644\n--- a/anaconda_lib/linting/anaconda_pep257.py\n+++ b/anaconda_lib/linting/anaconda_pep257.py\n@@ -10,6 +10,19 @@ Anaconda PyDocStyle wrapper\n try:\n     import pydocstyle\n\ndef _strip_encoding_declaration(code):\n\"\"\"Remove encoding declaration (PEP263) from Python source code.\n+\ncode is an unicode object containing Python source code.

In my case the issue is usually accompanied by jsonserver using 100% cpu on one core of my machine (non-stop, I've seen it run that way for over 30 minutes until I kill -9'ed it).\nIf it happens again I'll try to capture some info for you.\nA little bit more info. From what I can see jsonserver appears to behave normally for quite long periods of time (ie: stable memory / cpu usage) then suddenly it gobbles up the ram / cpu. In other words, anecdotally at least, it doesn't appear to be a classic memory leak but perhaps a particular situation that triggers the issue.. I'm using python 2.7.13. At least I assume I am, because that's the default python in my bash/zsh $PATH. I haven't configured Anaconda to use anything different.. Thanks for the potential fix @DamnWidget, I'm giving it a try now. If the issue reappears I'll let you know.. Hello, perhaps this will be useful info to someone. I'm one of the folks who has been plagued by high CPU usage when running the Anaconda plugin in sublime. Generally that issue has been attributed to JEDI.\nI've been running the patch in https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/pull/720 for the last day and my CPU usage is incredibly reduced. Anecdotally st3 CPU usage has gone from ramping up to using 60%/70% of one core to using 15%/20% (while typing and json_server is processing text). Most importantly when I stop typing it then falls back to an idle of 5%.\nWorth noting I'm working on several fairly large codebases. ~400K LOC Python, ~90K LOC coffeescript in window 1 and ~700K LOC python in window 2. Yes, I'm excluding node_modules, etc. from the projects.\n@DamnWidget perhaps much of the issues with high cpu usage are down to the lack of caching on the config file?\nPS: I could come up with some accurate CPU data if there is interest.. It's true, I have also found some versions of JEDI are much better than others. But this isn't about JEDI.\nI just found it curious that running stock Anaconda with the default version of JEDI has much reduced CPU when some basic caching (ie: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/pull/720) is applied to the json unpacking of the config.. No, well find ~ -name .anaconda turns up nothing anyway. I'll try to prove a bit more concretely what the improvement is. Perhaps it's just luck or some other thing changed.. ",
