Please send all pull requests to dev branch.\n2. Can you tell me what was changed Added a method for change the progress background color. I think we already have this method?\n. ",

    "krossovochkin": "AboutLibraries provides, at some point of view, simple way for creating in app screen with description of used open-source libraries. I found this useful.\nSo, AboutLibraries provides mechanism of building such a screen.\nIf somebody wants to add such a screen he needs to add AboutLibrary to his project, and there should be file \"library_xxxLibraryNamexxx_string.xml\" in which there is decription of xxxLibraryNamexxx.\nI can create this file in my projects \"values/\" folder for each library used, but more simpler way is to add this file to library itself. This is what I would like to see in your library :)\nTo see how it works, you can add to some project which using CircularProgressButton, AboutLibraries project and show fragment on some activity like it is described here: https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries/wiki/HOWTO:-Fragment\nNOTE: you should change this line:\nbundle.putStringArray(Libs.BUNDLE_LIBS, new String[]{\"AndroidIconify\", \"ActiveAndroid\", \"FButton\", \"Crouton\", \n\"HoloGraphLibrary\", \"ShowcaseView\", \"NineOldAndroids\", \"AndroidViewpagerIndicator\"});\nso that in this StringArray should be \"circularprogressbutton\" item.\n:)\n.

    "diego-gomez-olvera": "The library supports right now custom properties, but they cannot be defined in a theme following this pattern (http://blog.stylingandroid.com/custom-controls-part-3/) due that it ignores  the constructor parameter 'int defStyleAttr'. The commit 7a0725ebabcd4e7d93b3f0df15aa104bf4338064 fixes it.\n. It is normally known if the progress view is going to be determinate or not, so it is handy to have an XML attribute 'cpb_progressIndeterminate' to define it.\n. It is convenient to support the android attribute text as default for 'cpb_textIdle', as well as support CharSequence given the fact that TextView class hierarchy support it.\n. ",
