(I'm pretty sure that) The problem is that the buffer is NOT correctly null-terminated.\n. My attempt at explaining this bug:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-mmjUhVDP8\nIt's actually fairly obvious if you run static analysis.\n. What makes it really bad, is that there's a:\n} catch (...) {\n        //printStr(TEXT(\"JsonCpp exception captured\"));\n    }\nblock, which via SEH catches the access violation, and thus ~~\"can cause process corruption and lead to bugs that are hard to find and fix\"~~ makes Notepad++ more reliable.\nThose kinds of \"catch-all exceptions\" blocks are in 12 places in Notepad++, eleven of which swallow the exception and continue, which ~~silently corrupts the user's data~~ makes life easier for users.\n. Changing:\nint base64ToAscii(char* dest, const char* base64Str)\nto:\nint base64ToAscii(_Post_z_ _Post_readable_size_( return ) char* dest, _In_z_ const char* base64Str)\n...and applying my static analysis patch, yields:\nC6054   Zero termination missing\n    String 'dest' might not be zero-terminated\n    812 This expression may not zero-terminate 'dest'\n    841 Skip this loop, (assume 'i<nbLoop' is false)\n    880 Skip this branch, (assume 'padd==b64_1padded' is false)\n    883 Skip this branch, (assume 'padd==b64_2padded' is false)\n    812 'dest' should be zero-terminated but may not be\nFor reference: C6054\nSure enough, if I set a breakpoint at line 887, and Start Debugging:\n\nignore the message in the output window that's bitching about allocating executable memory.\n...and the string is not null-terminated, in exactly those conditions!\n. See: https://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/pull/37\n. Proof that denying an issue doesn't make it go away.\n. What external analyzer do you use?\nThis doesn't affect release builds.\n. If you're not convinced by me, maybe John Carmack will?\nhttps://youtu.be/4zgYG-_ha28?t=3491\n. I'm not sure that I understand your question?\nThis is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.\n. - There are a bunch of improved debugging/reliability features (e.g. SQLITE_ENABLE_API_ARMOR), and many small bugfixes. One bug was encountered by \"a prominent SQLite user\", and was serious enough to justify a rushed fix.\n- This is not a breaking change, if the behavior of Notepad++ changes in any (negative) way, then Notepad++ is broken, _by definition_.\n. Grr. Ok.\n. For reference: Commit: 9aa5d70\n. ....update when the next release is available\n. @milipili maybe this'd be a good \"won't fix\" candidate?\n. I submitted a patch for it yesterday but it hasn't been merged yet.\n. +1 \nsidenote: Why don't we have a .sln file? We could have scintilla build as an nmake project automatically if we had a .sln file instead of just a .vcxproj file.\n. +1\n:+1:  :clap:\n. Maybe it should say something about testing changes in Application Verifier?\n. > Where can we find a description of the coding style (hyperlink)?\nHuh...I can't actually find a link to it.\nThe best advice is probably: \"follow the style of the code around you\"\n. This is a known issue.\nThanks for reporting anyways :smile: \n. #120 is a proposed semi-fix.\n. > Thanks for mentioning solution.\nMy pleasure! It helps everyone involved.\n. I believe that this was fixed in 17e8ca3c15b151308e4ad68e85a878630dce793a ?\n. Awesome. Close this issue?\n. This issue (#19) is a known issue.\nSee https://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/issues/19 for the GitHub issue\nSee https://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/5266/ for the SourceForge issue\nSee https://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/pull/15 for the patch that fixes it.\n. Please close as a duplicate?\n. Hmm. Sorry, looks like I jumped to judgement here, (major duh) and assumed that was several paths. It's just one really long path. I take back what I said: \"Please close as a duplicate?\".\nLemme see if I understand what's going on.\n. Is Notepad++ already open, when you try to open the problematic file?\nWhat's really weird, is that the problematic file's path shouldn't be long enough to cause this problem in the first place. \nThe size of the buffer passed to ::GetFullPathName is MAX_PATH (260 characters) - which is more than the 165 character path that's causing the problem: \"C:\\Users\\Gary\\Music\\Fleetwood Mac\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam stereo-M1-SBD.txt\"\nAs a side note: Notepad++, like _many other Windows applications, misinterprets MAX_PATH as \"the length of the longest possible path\", which WAS true, 25 years ago. In fact, MAX_PATH means \"the maximum length of _a single path component\" - i.e. the name of a file/folder.\nFor paths LONGER than MAX_PATH, my patch is a partial fix that is intended to preserve the current Notepad++ behavior, which - this issue notwithstanding - is very much so broken. \nIf you have a copy of Python installed, could you try running something like this:\n```\n\n\n\nimport os\nos.path.abspath(\"C:\\Users\\Gary\\Music\\Fleetwood Mac\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam stereo-M1-SBD.txt\")\n```\n\n\n\n...and report the results?\n. > Are you unable to replicate the error?\nIn a very quick attempt, I could not. But I plan to create \"Fleetwood Mac\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam stereo-M1-SBD.txt\" in my Music folder; which will hopefully replicate the issue.\n. I managed to replicate it.\nWhen I doubled the size of the buffer passed to checkSingleFile, it returned this:\nL\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Alexander Riccio\\\\Documents\\\\GitHub\\\\notepad-plus-plus\\\\PowerEditor\\\\visual.net\\\\\\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Alexander Riccio\\\\Music\\\\Fleetwood Mac\\\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam\\\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam stereo-M1-S.txt\\\"\"\n....which is really weird.\n. What's really really weird, is that when I pass it to the test program that I wrote for that patch, I get this:\n``\nargc: 2\nargv[ 2 ]:C:\\Users\\Alexander Riccio\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\test_GetFullPathName_single_file\\Debug\\test_GetFullPathName_single_file.exeargv[ 2 ]:C:\\Users\\Alexander Riccio\\Music\\Fleetwood Mac\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam stereo-M1-S.txt`\nmultiplePaths: C:\\Users\\Alexander Riccio\\Music\\Fleetwood Mac\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam stereo-M1-S.txt\nLength of input to GetFullPathName: 179\n    multiplePaths: `C:\\Users\\Alexander Riccio\\Music\\Fleetwood Mac\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam stereo-M1-S.txt`\n\n    result: 179\n\n    resulting buffer: `C:\\Users\\Alexander Riccio\\Music\\Fleetwood Mac\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam\\Fleetwood Mac & Clapton 1970-02-05 Boston,MA Tea Party Jam stereo-M1-S.txt`\n\n```\nNotice that the buffer returned by ::GetFullPathName in Notepad++ has the path to the current working directory prepended, which thus means that the buffer is too small....but why would it prepend the current working directory??\n. ....no I know that, but I'd like to get to the bottom of ::GetFullPathName's bad behavior\n. @MAPJe71 +1\n. Fun fact:\nPython loop variables leak into the enclosing scope(s)\n. Did you say _SP2???!? Holy crap, what the hell? _Not even SP3?!?\nI just hope that computer isn't involved in the Healthcare or Financial sectors. If you are, then you're probably in serious legal trouble, or are at risk of it.\n. Yes, I now see that I was wrong to assume that the Google Drive issue is the same as the dropbox path encoding issue.....\n....but this patch fixes a separate bug in the same function - part of the same general issue with broken cloud settings - that I can reproduce fairly reliably, and was reported in two separate tickets (#5195, #5211), with 10 users confirmed to be affected (11, including myself), and also a possible security bug. Any one of those reasons is good enough to do more than nothing.\n. > declared/defined with const as much as possible\nBravo sir, bravo.\n. > I prepared a test file of 900 000 pseudorandom ints. \n(one of) the mark(s) of a good computer scientists is supporting assertions/hypothesis with evidence. Nice work.\nLgtm. +1.\n. I'm curious though, I didn't see any exception safety problems here (hence the lgtm), but why the manual memory management?\n. > Have fixed these things now.\nNice work. Good patch! \nI can't get over that use of std::count - it's awesome.\n\n\nI don't see how it can be written without new/delete since it interfaces with Scintilla.\n\nEh? I don't see a problem with std::unique_ptr here? It is moot indeed, but wouldn't it be:\nstd::unique_ptr<TCHAR[]> buf = std::make_unique<TCHAR[]>(bufSize);\n    getGenericText(buf.get( ), bufSize, start, end);\n    generic_string text = buf.get( );\n. ...but how else are we to execute floating point arrays and dereference ((int*)0)?!!?!\n_Real men_ don't need type safety.\n. In other words, we should ban C-style casts.\n. Speaking of C-Style casts in new code:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/251e987a715cdb7ff829e23319677e849705a6b8#commitcomment-11559918\n. @NN--- lololol\n. Why are you maintaining a separate repo? It's going to get out of sync pretty quickly, thus, any PRs that you may want to open will be very large, and therefore less likely to be merged!\n. Wait, why were we using int for SendDlgItemMessage & SendMessage to begin with?? LRESULT isn't new....if I remember correctly, It dates back to the days of 16-bit windows!\n. > Technically in Win32 LRESULT=LONG_PTR=long and it has the same size of int.\nYes, you are correct there.\n\nSo in Win32 these types are interchangeable\n\nNo, not really. As a long time reader of The Old New Thing, I absolutley refuse to say they're interchangable. \nYes, the code will probably work, but that's essentially a coincidence.  When Microsoft changes the implementation of LRESULT, any code that assumes LRESULT is interchangeable with int or long needs to be carefully reviewed. We should (try to) never rely on implementation details.\nThat's the raison d'\u00eatre of LRESULT.\n. Oh no I totally see that you meant it generally, but my strictness and specificity are intentional, to ensure clarity.\n. Nice work.\n. This issue has been reported ad nauseam. It was my fault, its been fixed.\n. As of 5c272a88184748435acce70bceca5ae33f989731, I believe that release is imminent.\n. What's up with HEX-Editor? Nobody maintaining it?\n. That's funny. The sources for HEX-Editor won't even compile correctly. All sorts of issues with undeclared identifiers (they look like obvious scoping mistakes) and iterator issues.....how the hell did it compile in the first place?\n. WELL, two minutes after running static analysis, I found a bug where a call to memcpy(info->text, buffer, length) might evaluate to memcpy(info->text, buffer, 4294967295), and it's in a function called MultiTypeCombo::decode, which is highly suspicious.\nThe bug is that the return value of WideCharToMultiByte (an int) is assigned to a UINT, in the expression:\nlength = ::WideCharToMultiByte(codePage, 0, (WCHAR*)info->text, -1, buffer, 256, NULL, NULL) - 1;\n....and if WideCharToMultiByte fails, that expression evaluates as:\nlength = - 1;\n...and assigning -1 to an UINT, well, that's 4,294,967,295.\nStatic analysis is truly invaluable.\n. So I've been cleaning HEXEditor up a bit, and I'll send the changes to the author. I hope that I've fixed the problem :)\n. +1 :+1: The sooner we fix this, the less pain we'll have to endure.\n. >  is obvious to me you have not read any of this\n@rcdailey I understand (and, to some degree, share) your frustration, but please refrain from ad hominem attacks (\"attack\" might not be the best word), as they're counterproductive.\nInstead of just saying \"you are wrong\"/'git blame will still work', provide evidence that it does. No specific format is necessary, be it a screenshot, text of a shell session, or a video, is constructive (and educational) for all involved.\n\nI just explained it to you\n\nLinking to said explanation also helps :)\n\nPlease go back and read everything [...]\n\nSpecificity, as before, helps.\n. > You are asking for links/etc but it's all here.\nNonono it's not for my benefit, but in this case it's specifically for @donho\n\nAnd there is no attack going on here.\n\nYeah sorry, \"attack\" was the wrong word. I did however sense a degree of frustration, which is not an optimal way of conveying thoughts over the internet.\n\nWhy are you saying you \"don't know what changed in these files\"? There is nothing but line ending changes.\n\nPerhaps they are legitimately not showing up for him. Whatever the actual reason, if you tell him something that's obviously not true (to him, as \n. shit, I didn't mean to hit \"Comment\"\n. [continued from where I prematurelyposted].... as is the flaw in aristotelian logic/epistemology), (i.e. \"there's [something] on your screen! If you can't see it, look harder!\", when said thing is not actually visible), he's just going to tire of the whole thing, and stop paying attention to you.\n. Numbers?\n(I'm guessing, obviously, that it's less than ~2:50)\n. No, I trust you; but numbers are always good.\n. Fantastic.\n. I'm sure that there are lots of related improvements -- there are lots of repetitive #includes in implementation files.\n. > But it deserves another PR.\nAgreed.\n. I tried this, somewhere else (I can't find it - grr!). Good luck getting this merged.\n. I know, it did for me to.\nSame thing with SQLite.\n. > Maybe you should propose pull requests to the main repository ?\nWe absolutely should do this.\n\nAnd since it has a project file you should really make a simple solution with both projects and reference.\nAdd sln file to repo back.\n\nXref: #87\nXref: #90 \nXref: https://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/commit/ec105d7b5f354aabe9906de74d0eaa00a42a9647\nXref: https://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/commit/0628508ef0dbdda9955134920b9331adb7bf02ca\n.

By the way, a rebase is actually an even better way to do it, but rebasing is, for some people (like me) not quite a habit yet.\n...and while you have a shell open, it's probably a good idea to run a git fsck --full, just to make sure nothing is broken. If/when fsck complains about \"dangling\" and \"unreachable\" crap, don't worry! That's totally normal, and nothing is broken.\n. > Any reason you couldn't just accept the merge and save yourself some trouble?\nYeah, what?\n. I'm totally fine with a single loop, but either way, the policy should be documented. If we support VS2010, then we can't really use override/final, std::atomic, and a whole bunch of scattered good things.\nHere's an interesting idea: restrict VS2010 (and older) backwards compatibility to plugin-facing-headers only, so if a plugin ~~is broken enough that it~~ requires an older version of Visual Studio, it'll still compile. That'd leave the rest of the codebase unbridled.\n. By the way, if anybody needs to do profiling, I have a copy of vTune, and will happily run tests with it.\n.

Can you open up the dump in windbg and run !analyze -v?\n. Sorry about that. Notepad++ sometimes stores a dump of its own in the Notepad++ folder in Program Files (x86). Windbg is installed with the Windows SDK.\n. Since Notepad++ asks to save a dump file, can either of you do so?\n. Hmph. When it hangs, can you create a dump by right clicking on it in task manager?\n. OH, and I didn't actually say it (duh!), but this is an overall good PR.\nIf you can, add the text of the warning, along with a short description of why you disabled it, to the #pragmas.

Xref: Issue #24\n. > 1) Don't actually know, I just imitated some other header.\nsnickers quietly\n\n(2) is definitely my C background speaking..... but using a struct doesn't prevent RAII behavior?? Saying struct longRunningOperation is not functionally different than class longRunningOperation. \nstruct longRunningOperation however, has public inheritance by default. Thus if someone needs to derive from it, struct anotherRunningOperation : longRunningOperation is the same as struct anotherRunningOperation : public longRunningOperation.\n. An alternative, but messy fix: mark FileManager::backupCurrentBuffer() as _No_competing_thread_, use locking to protect calling from multiple threads, and verify with static analysis.\nRelated:\n- C26130\n- C26160\n- C26110\n. > What I mean is that I only want structs as dumb groupings of variables. \nFair enough.

Yeah, I care more than others about basic code quality/correctness, but I'm also a user.\nI think Notepad++ is a(n overall) great piece of software that I use on a daily basis, except I'm constantly frustrated by the sheer number of bugs that persist.\nPartly for security reasons, I run most software under application verifier, which detects buffer overruns, heap corruption, and all sorts of nastiness, and triggers a breakpoint if it finds anything. If you're not running the offending program in a debugger, it crashes. There are literally hundreds of bugs in the Notepad++ code base that trigger these crashes, nearly all of them security bugs. This makes Notepad++ almost unusable. So I'd also like Notepad++ to _work_.\n. +Possibly interested parties:\n@andreas-jonsson\n. Xref: #60\n. Xref: #16\n. Xref: #13\n. Xref: #14\n.

It's even worse than drap & drop.\nNotepad++ running with administrator privileges is a security nightmare. If someone exploits Notepad++, then they're free to literally do anything on the victim's computer.\n. > You can use to include the system's header.\nUse _what exactly? I think you're missing a word there.\n. It causes problems with third party libraries (SQLite). I'm pretty sure that SQLite _was using that syntax, but because Notepad++ explicitly forces the inclusion of several project folders, Visual Studio uses Notepad++'s header first. I'm not sure why this only showed up for me when I was messing around - my guess is that Notepad++'s copy of SQLite is ~~hacked~~ modified - but it's a legitimate concern nonetheless.\n. Nope, not right now. However, I'm guessing that some else will.\n. > But maybe we could simply use better includes, with something like #include \"MISC/Process/Process.h\" for example\nThat would work too!\n. Xref: #180 \n. Also: The new dialog can use quite a bit of memory, as it loads all of the installed shell extensions (e.g. 7-zip, Realtek Bluetooth ~~bloatware~~ feature enhancements, Citrix receiver, overeager antimalware vendors, NVIDIA's 80,000 control panels, etc...), and trigger all sorts of disk thrashing.\nI like the idea behind it, but with the newer dialog, we pay for a lot that we don't use.\n. I think you're referring to this comment:\n\n// Don't touch the following 3 lines, they are cursed !!!\n      oldProc = (WNDPROC)::GetWindowLongPtr(hFileDlg, GWL_WNDPROC);\n      if ((long)oldProc > 0)\n          ::SetWindowLongPtr(hFileDlg, GWLP_WNDPROC, (LONG_PTR)fileDlgProc);\n\n...I have a bad feeling that it's a lurking bug\n. Maybe this is why they're cursed: they're wrong?:\n\nSo remember, the only things you can do with the values you get from GetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, GWLP_WNDPROC) are to (1) pass them to CallWindowProc, or (2) pass them back to SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, GWLP_WNDPROC).\n\n...and of course, Notepad++ just calls oldProc directly in 4 places, instead of using CallWindowProc.\n. By the way: GWLP_WNDPROC and GWL_WNDPROC are both defined to be -4.\n. The boost NuGet package is a great idea! If it was a header-only library, git-subtree would probably be better.\nAside from the core scintilla edits and the FunctionParsersManager casting, everything looks good.\n. I'm thinking that you might want to squash all of the commits in this Pull Request, as it's getting very big.\n. there are a multitude of tutorials on squashing commits, but I'm not sure which to suggest.\n. \n@milipili I really like how you're using milestones to organize issues & pull requests, but it seems like you were beaten to it?\n. >  Shouldn't you pass the size of target string  str  to  _tcscat_s  as second argument?\nTemplate parameter inference is a pretty cool thing.\n. > Unless you wanna do some bug-fixes or add some new features, don't waste your time here.\nI assumed, because #146, #145, #144, and #138, were all merged, that this was an acceptable change. I'll have to dig through some bug reports...\n. Meanwhile, an uninitialized read fix has been accepted in 223caa25d0c01c91f631f55f4fc031a165005a9e .\n. Xref: #180 \n. Should I submit a PR for this? It's a pretty trivial fix?\n. @milipili this is really not an enhancement, as it could cause all sorts of nasty buffer overruns.\n. If lstrcpyn guaranteed null termination, then I could tolerate it, (partly) because callers could use this function without first zero initializing, and later sanity checking. Returning TRUE when the buffer isn't initialized isn't just lying, it's cause for Very Bad Things, if not an actual security bug. \n. Ummmm....ok? I think I understand. I'd love to hear more about this major code refactoring, as I've tried to do such (on a smaler scale) myself, only to be rejected.\n. ....and robustness, too? Getting Notepad++ Microsoft SDL-compliant?\n. Cross-platform? Wait what?\n. > Thank you for the suggestions :)\nYour welcome! Always happy to help \ud83d\ude0a\nSadly, I've been away from home, thus using my phone, and had to stop right in the middle of the code review, because my phone decided that it didn't want to leave any more line notes >:(\n. Sorry for the repetitive line notes! I saw several issues repeated, so I just copied and pasted the messages.\n. Some general thoughts:\n- Whenever you're calling across an API boundary, into a function that has out parameters, and not properly checking the return code, you're triggering undefined behavior. Unless it's otherwise explicitly specified, then the state of the out parameters is undefined. Ignoring return values can often work when tested, but later, somewhere down the road, causes sinister bugs.\n- I didn't see that many asserts. They're not strictly necessary, and you're free to ignore this, but it's always a good idea to assert like you're being paid-per-assert.\nSome thoughts specifically about this Pull Request:\nI like the idea, but in its current form, it probably won't be accepted - it's too big & too complex. \n- It seems like there's a lot of duplicated code. Try refactoring some of it?\n- Many control structures are just _far too complex. I'm getting a headache while just doing a cursory review of them, and that doesn't bode well for merging.\n- Move some code out of the headers? It might just be me, but I think it's harder to read headers that have lots of inline code. I consider virtual functions an exception to this, because defining them in headers can greatly aid in devirtualization. _Personally, I question the value of code like:\nbool getManualMode() const { \n        return _manualMode; \n    }\n- Look into ReadDirectoryChanges. I share your hatred of polling.\n- Try to cut the number of raw changes in half. Consider it a challenge, if you're having trouble.\n- Refactor code that looks like (the following) into a separate function. An anonymous namespace is a perfect place for a free function containing the factored-out code. i.e.:\nimagine the conditions are more complex\n```\n//some large function above\nint someVariable;\nif ( someCondition )\n    someVariable = 1;\nelse\n    someVariable = 0;\n//rest of some large function\n```\n...to:\n```\nnamespace {\nint someDescriptiveName( bool someCondition )\n{\n    if ( someCondition )\n        return 1;\n    else\n        return 0;\n}\n}\n```\n...so that the caller can just:\nconst int someVariable = someDescriptiveName( someCondition );\n. > And sorry for the huge amount of problems and for the late answer (got a lot of work to do, and I really underestimated this directory thing...)\nLol, no worries!\n\nA lot of problems were caused by C&P from old code. As far as I can see e.g. the SendMessage() without checks is also done in the master branch all over the place in TreeView and ProjectPanel.\nAlso, there's also a lot of duplicated code in the master as well.\nI think it's the best way to rework these problems completely and consistently and place all of this duplicated code into some functions with checking.\n\nAgreed, but we need to start somewhere.\n\nFrom my point of view, you should wait before spending too much time on this. As soon as it compiles with cmake there will have several incompatible changes and this code in the current state won't be isolated enough.\n\nmostly agreed ;)\nWe can still ponder changes in the meantime. Any ideas what changes will be incompatible?\n.

We're throwing away the length of the string via c_str(), then recalculating it for the std::wstring(PCWSTR) constructor!\n. struct FoundInfo is in FindReplaceDlg.h:\nstruct FoundInfo {\n    FoundInfo(int start, int end, const TCHAR *fullPath)\n        : _start(start), _end(end), _fullPath(fullPath) {};\n    int _start;\n    int _end;\n    generic_string _fullPath;\n};\n. ....and whadayaknow, fullpath comes all the way from Notepad_plus::findInCurrentFile, where the line:\nnbTotal += _findReplaceDlg.processAll(ProcessFindAll, FindReplaceDlg::_env, isEntireDoc, pBuf->getFullPathName());\n...calls Buffer::getFullPathName(), which is defined as:\nconst TCHAR * getFullPathName() const {\n        return _fullPathName.c_str();\n    };\n....so for each 'found' result, we're not only _constructing a copy of the file's path, we're throwing away and recalculating the length of that path_!\nSo a fix for this would be two-pronged:\n1. Catch the std::bad_alloc, maybe at Notepad_plus::process, case WM_FINDALL_INCURRENTDOC, and return a failure code (is it FALSE for process?)\n2. Use less memory for each found result.\n. The pure virtual function call issue is probably a separate bug.\n. Perhaps examples of \"bad\" and \"good\" pull requests would help?\n. Xref: #218\nXref: #223\nXref: #225\n. Yay! This should be much clearer for newbies.\nHowever, we really do need a strict, reason based, and self-consistent definition of an \"enhancement\". Otherwise, there'll be never ending squabbles over whether a given Pull Request is an \"enhancement\" or not. Particularly with regards to rejected Pull Requests.\n. Try UIforETW, along with...\n. manual wait analysis\n. Did you get a chance to profile it?\n. quietly fumes\n. IMO, adding countof everywhere is the wrong way of doing this. We should be using Secure Template Overloads.\n. So I completely missed the fact that you replaced sprintf with snprintf... aside from the fact that I never cease to astound myself with my own stupidity, why not replace it with_stprintf_s?\n. Eek! Merge conflicts! Please resolve!\n. @RobertSH personal attacks, or any other form of non-constructive criticism, are not welcome.\n. That looks like a C++/CX, a C#, or a CLI/.NET exception.... What plugins do you have installed?\n. @milipili no wontfix?\n. It's too early to think about making Notepad++ cross platform! Notepad++ has major issues properly complying with the Windows API alone, There is massive technical debt that we need to pay off first!\nHonestly, I think that running Notepad++ under WINE is going to be far more robust & reliable for the foreseeable future.\nIn the mean time, see:\n- \"SciTE: The Notepad++ for Linux\"\n- \"ScintillaEditorFamily\"\n. > Only complaining as always :)\nWell, you're not wrong :)\n\nIf anything, working on making the tool cross platform will help bring to surface a variety of problems and thus solutions to those problems making de-bugging much faster (3 times faster to be exact)\n\n@hasibrm - where did the \"3 times faster\" come from? Especially with such exactness?\n\nHonestly, N++ is one of the most stable programs I've used.\n\nWell yeah, if you catch all the Access Violations, then the program won't crash in predictable, consistent, or obvious ways.\n\nThe majority of the bugs are simple logical errors...and I'm sure a few can be blamed on improper use of the API.\n\nThe documentation for lstrcpy, lstrcpyn, lstrcat, wsprintf, all share \"Warning Do not use\" as the first line in their documentation. There are perfectly safe alternatives, usually drop-in replacements, but nonetheless, Notepad++ uses them ~65 times. I guess you could say that that's \"improper use of the API\".\n\nI'd suggest since there are \"major issues\", then file bug reports! Not just \"this doesn't comply with xyz\", but bugs the user will encounter. Since you are aware that something doesn't comply, then create reproducible steps to make it fail. \n\n@dail8859 Who is that directed at?\n. So, debugging speed is the reciprocal of the number of platforms involved?\nI'm sold, let's support OS/2, Solaris, & AmigaOS!\n\nMore seriously, what would _dis_prove your hypothesis?\n. Nice idea, but this won't be accepted?\n. I really like the threat modeling that  @jonandr is doing\n. > Self elevation (with specific flags in some cases) is a common pattern even for MS programs. It is even part of their samples (https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/CppUACSelfElevation-5bfc52dd)\nJust because it's common, or even exemplified doesn't mean that it's a _good_ idea!\n\nSecurity issue is not the same thing as bug.\n\nA bug is not necessarily a security issue, but a security issue is necessarily a bug! \n\nIf the command-line parser is buggy, it is likely that the feature will just not work and it would be quite visible. \n\nIt's also very likely that it will work correctly most of the time, but still have massive security bugs.\n\nAnyway a complete implementation would require more than that. It requires both read and write capabilities (and monitoring about external file modifications).\n\nI think you might have misunderstood? A program that does nothing other than parse argc arguments from argv is a pretty silly program! @jonandr is talking about memory safety issues, which are always a problem in a native language like C/C++, but most obvious when dealing with pointer arithmetic & friends.\n. > I'm wondering how it can be ensured that the elevated process really does what it's supposed to do. \nWell, that's always the question with security ;) You might want to check out the Google Chrome/chromium sandbox & security model - it's phenomenal, and confronts all of the same problems.\n\nIf you're telling it the path through command line arguments, then how will the user know that these arguments haven't been tampered with? \n\nTell what about the path? How'd the user get involved in parsing command line arguments? This is the right kind of mindset for threat modeling, but specificity is necessary.\n\nSure the user can expand that UAC dialog window, but it's of limited size.\n\nWhy does the UAC dialog's size matter?\n\nAnyway, the path and content is ultimately defined by the non-elevated GUI part of the application, and that could always be manipulated.\n\nEh? It's defined? Again, threat modeling, specifics. You might have the idea upside-down. I'll elaborate in a second comment.\n\nDo you think of supporting restricted read access files as well, or just restricted write access? If the non-elevated process can read and monitor the file, only the actual writing needs to be handled. \n\nEh? There's no such thing as write-only access, like there's no such thing as write-only memory?\nGiving non-privileged processes read access to privileged information is a different kind of vulnerability, albeit an arguably less severe one (information disclosure/information leak), and is a bad idea. Imagine leaking /etc/passwd. Sure it's hashed, but now the hashes have been leaked.\nSide note: If you need to edit a root-owned file on Linux, (here, gnome) use gksudo, not sudo. There's a lot of magic going on behind the scenes (in the X window system) to make the UNIX security model work with a GUI.\n\nYou need some IPC channel anyway to send the content to the elevated process. Not sure what C++ has to offer here.\n\nWell, I'm certain that any IPC implementation (in any language other than assembly) is C/C++ at the bottom. It wont be easy, but c'mon, this is C++. Most things are hard in C++. \n\nMaybe it's better to concentrate on this write-only aspect first as it happens often when modifying system config files. \n\nComments upcoming.\n. Hmm. f0fa5e74b8afbc92114e489ccd81eaa9b6aed35e caused all hell to break loose.\n. Did Notepad++ offer to save a dump file?\n. @aprovent if you have WinDbg installed, you can attach to notepad++.exe and try to reproduce the crash.\n. Huh, this is interesting. How'd you do it?\n. As of b31e213b7ba3121370a82bb27955a12c4cd0ef0c, this is broken again!\n. The parenthesis around MF_CHECKED and `MF_UNCHECKED are not necessary. I left them there because:\n1. Mixing bitwise and ternary operators is very confusing!\n2. As a (good) habit, I ensure that all usage of operators in expressions involves only primary expressions. This is also strongly advised in my copy of MISRA C 2012 (it's rule 12.1).\n3. Parenthesis are cheap!\nOtherwise, it's totally cool to drop them.\n. > Could you please point where it is discussed that cleaning up the code is something to be avoided?\nThe most direct reference is in #207.\nIt's not clearly spelled out (per se) that clean up Pull Requests are rejected, but it's a de facto standard for Notepad++.  \nThe closest thing thereto is in CONTRIBUTING.md:\n\nAll Pull Requests, except for translations and user documentation, need to be attached to a issue on GitHub. For Pull Requests regarding enhancements and questions, the issue must first be approved by one of project's administrators before being merged into the project. An approved issue will have the label Accepted. For issues that have not been accepted, you may request to be assigned to that issue.\nOpening a issue beforehand allows the adminstrators and the communitiy to discuss bugs and enhancements before work begins, preventing wasted effort.\n. > The need for spending time with a complete code refactoring itself is the result of a failure in accepting smaller commits that would otherwise fix small problems as soon as they are spotted, and a failure in ensuring only code with good quality (well-formatted and well-thought) is published.\nIn the meantime, however, old code is fated to abandon, because the work is going mainly onto the reformatted version. Fixes to old code that are also good to the new one, logically should be picked selectively/manually; therefore, it doesn't matter whether it receives or not small reformats.\nFurthermore, for being essentially public, open-source software should allow broad, open participation in the code refactoring itself.\n\nI agree. That said, your disagreement is not with me.\n. > I would merge your commits and much others if I could understand and review that kind of changes.\nFear not, nobody understands C++!\n\nJust ignoring errors, inefficiencies and similar makes no sense to me at all.\n\nAt least  @milipili is more consistent than don ho.\n. > At least @milipili is more consistent than don ho.\n^ case and point\n. > case and point\nGrr. I've mutilated it.\n. > Anyway, AFAIK, the \"settings on Cloud\" will be removed by a more simpler method.\nCan you elaborate?\n\nMy suspicion about the cause of the crash is that Google Drive is probably not expecting its configuration files to be locked by another application. And when Google Drive itself is then unable to write to its own configuration files, bad things happen. That's my theory.\n\nDid you ever get a dump of the crashing Google Drive?\n. > AFAIK maintaining this kind of feature is kinda hard. These products always break the API and we always have to catch up, which is really annoying for users. Anyway since n++ only uses local files on a mounted remote folder, be able to simply select a target folder is probably more efficient and quite less error-prone.\nI actually agree. I'm on the \"minus 100 points\" side of things. If it helps, so is Raymond Chen.\n. > We don't care here of a crash of Google Drive.\nOh I know, but I'm (personally) curious about that crash. It's unusual for file-locking issues to crash a process.\nI'm wondering, maybe a plugin is at fault? I've seen all sorts of weird plugin locking issues... a plugin once wouldn't let go of the loader lock, so I could break into notepad++.exe in the debugger!\n. Xref: #106 \nXref: #135 \nXref: #6\n. Cool.\n. Should I submit patches for incremental fixes of this?\n. How's this going?\n. Any idea which plugin?\n. Do you have a dumpfile? Can you run under Application Verifier?\nIf you can run under Application Verifier (it's extremely good at diagnosing access violations), enable the following checks:\n- Under Basics:\n  - Under Heaps:\n    - Size\n    -Protect-Addr-UseLFHGuardPages- UnderMiscellaneous:\n  -DirtyStacks`\nIf you don't have WinDbg, just try to save a dumpfile (when Notepad++ asks you to).\n...then Open WinDbg, launch Notepad++.exe (File->Open Executable).\nIf you see something like:\n(b17c.aff8): Break instruction exception - code 80000003 (first chance)\neax=00000000 ebx=00000000 ecx=80140000 edx=00000000 esi=7e3bc000 edi=00000000\neip=77f03bed esp=0133f89c ebp=0133f8c8 iopl=0         nv up ei pl zr na pe nc\ncs=0023  ss=002b  ds=002b  es=002b  fs=0053  gs=002b             efl=00000246\nntdll!LdrpDoDebuggerBreak+0x2b:\n77f03bed cc              int     3\nThat's harmless... just hit F5 to continue. \nRun until it complains about an access violation. When it does, you'll see something like:\n(b17c.aff8): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)\nFirst chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.\nThis exception may be expected and handled.\neax=000000f0 ebx=0c244fd8 ecx=01184998 edx=0c244fd8 esi=00000028 edi=012e91c0\neip=010f5574 esp=012e9024 ebp=012e9044 iopl=0         nv up ei ng nz na pe cy\ncs=0023  ss=002b  ds=002b  es=002b  fs=0053  gs=002b             efl=00010287\nnpp+0x145574:\n010f5574 0fb6041e        movzx   eax,byte ptr [esi+ebx]     ds:002b:0c245000=??\nThen run !analyze -v, and report back.\n. > Notepad++ does not seem to want to launch if the UseLFHGuardPages option under application verifier is checked. I ran it with all the other options you stated.\nThat's probably the bug I reported in #106, #135, and #363. It's pretty damned annoying that certain people deny the existence of that bug rather than fix it.\n\nI am not exactly sure how to run the !analyze -v command\n\nNo worries, WinDbg is a strange beast! You're not alone.\nThe LibreOffice/Document Foundation wiki has a very useful tutorial: \"How to get a backtrace with WinDbg\"\nProtip: Power users can pimp** their debuggers with some configuration tricks, as the default WinDbg config is pretty terrible!\nOnce you figure out how to run !analyze -v, and k, post the results. I'm going to manually match the stack trace to locations in the source code, so we can tell what's going on. I'll track down the bug itself, and report it to NppFTP if it is their bug.\nWhen you're done, you'll probably want to disable Application Verifier for notepad++.exe, else you'll face a crash every time you hit one of Notepad++'s bugs, of which there are many.\nThe bit that you posted so far hints at a NULL pointer dereference, accessing memory that (essentially) doesn't exist.\nExplained:\nComparing the byte at ( ( address stored in register eax ) + 1 ) with zero:\n\ncmp     byte ptr [eax+1],0\n\nWhere eax is:\n\neax=00000000\n\nThus cmp     byte ptr [eax+1],0 means, in MASM/Intel syntax, \"compare the byte at NULL + 1 with zero\".\n** for any non-English speakers, think \"Pimp My Ride\", not prostitution!\n. > I have a dump file, where would you recommend I place it?\nWhoops, I missed that!\nHow big is it? Can you compress it?\n. Hrmph. In the past, I've manually traced the address back to the source code, but I didn't have enough luck to do so here. The bug does appear to be in NppFTP, because the stack ends in NppFTP:\nSTACK_TEXT:  \nWARNING: Stack unwind information not available.

Thanks, @Rikk.\nWhen I get to my computer, I think I'll profile it so I can better understand what's going on.\nMy best guess is that the easiest \"fix\" is to just rewrite FunctionListPanel::reload to be _really_ fast, which would be much simpler than some sort of double buffering.\n(will elaborate in next comment)\n. I did something similar in another program (altWinDirStat), where an MFC ListView was flickering.\nThere were several columns of text, and formatting text was the main time-consumer. Instead of implementing double/triple buffering, I rewrote the string formatting functions to:\n- Preallocate memory, as a fixed-size buffer on the stack, enough for most strings that I'd need to format.\n- Write directly into the preallocated buffer, no copying to/from temporaries.\n- Keep track of the number of characters written, at each step - to later enable a DrawText call with a known length (no need to search for a null-terminator!).\n- Extensively use static analysis, so I didn't screw up!\nIf I remember correctly, I had an order of magnitude improvement, and it scaled very well, for essentially no design changes.\n. > But why it needs to reload when double click entry in 'find result'? File is not being changed, thus no change in functions.\nI agree, there's no good reason to repeat all the work, and it might be a really simple fix. However:\n- We should be sure that the file hasn't actually changed, and carefully review the code to verify.\n- I suspect that double-clicking the entry in \"find result\" isn't the only manifestation of slowness in reload.\n. Does anybody know: For the function list, does SciLexer.dll need to be compiled with Boost's PCRE?\n. Grr.

Afaik, gdi32 is a thing from win 9x era.\n\nIdeally, yea. But it's not that bad, and DirectWrite is a bit more work. This is partly for compatibility reasons, as DirectWrite (and it's other high-performance family members, like DirectComposition) isn't supported under Windows XP. We might want to come back to this in the future.\n. > Are your symbols configured correctly?\nAhh, nevermind. I'm hitting the same problem... and yes, the analyzed reports are sharable.

Not only is there no guarantee that the std::wstring's pointer member points to at least MAX_PATH characters of space, but it's purposefully const.\n.

Judging by the last 3 digits in the address (0x00000084DCAE7000, three zeros), it's a buffer overrun. Yet, at line 88 the code isn't buffer handling:\nif  (match_start <= endPos) {\n...

Resident const nazi here: Why isn't this const Progress* const progress (note that the second const doesn't need to be changed in the header)\n. It looks like this is an optional parameter?

I know that you didn't add this check, _but it makes no sense_.\nPlain old operator new throws a std::bad_alloc on failure to allocate. operator new std::nothrow returns NULL on failure. \nThis probably isn't an actual bug insofar as functionality is concerned, but it's still wrong.\n. You didn't add this, but casting to void is almost always a mistake. What for?\n. > I'll do it.\nI have a feeling that if you do it, it's more likely to get merged than if I were to do it :)\n. I wouldn't really worry about it if Notepad++ was smaller. It's just that Notepad++ is kinda big, and thus little things can greatly impact compilation time.\nI guess it's ok here, but it still makes me grumble >:(\n. To be fair about my own pedantry, using const in places where it isn't strictly necessary looks better and more readable to someone (like me) who is a self-described insufferable const nazi.\n. Funny thing I learned from Bruce Dawson: In const Progress* const progress you can omit the second const in the declaration, but keep it in the definition (its still valid C++), which keeps the headers terse, so that nobody has to see the const-fest unless they're actually interested in how the function is implemented.\n. Huh? It's politically incorrect? I thought that (at least) since John Carmack self describes as one, it was an accepted term, but if people are offended, I'll happily stop.\n. That's a perfectly good reason. I no longer have reason to be grumpy :)\n. Yeah, I was just wondering if you could shed some light on it. Don't take it personally.\n. > Actually I did add this.\nThat's actually kinda funny.\n\nI need to pass my class instance to the static window procedure. The way to do it is via CreateWindowEx LPVOID param\n\nI was curious, because I know that the standard guarantees that any pointer (to an object) can implicitly convert to an (identically const/volatile) void*, no explicit (void*) needed.\nSo I went ahead, and, on a local build, changed:\n_hOwner, NULL, _hInst, (LPVOID)this);\nto: \n_hOwner, NULL, _hInst, this);\n...and everything compiled without issue. No need for the explicit cast - if you ever need to explicitly cast something to LPVOID (or PVOID, because we're not writing code for 16-bit systems), and it's not of different const/volatile qualification....well, uh, try without the cast!\nI remember something like this as the culprit in a recent Kernel-Mode vulnerability in Windows, but can't find the original article.\n. Why not just assign directly to nppGUI._fileAutoDetection?\ni.e.:\nif (!isChecked)\n    nppGUI._fileAutodetection = cdDisabled;\n. > I don't think the explicit cast here can do any harm anyway so I won't bother making new patch-set.\nFair enough.\nThe issue in the Windows vulnerability (doesn't apply here, but the idea is applicable) was that  someone was casting the address of a PVOID (i.e. a &PVOID/PVOID*/void**) to a plain-old PVOID/void*; the C-style cast just goes ahead, and nods encouragingly.\n. I noticed that you dropped the #ifdef UNICODE/#endif....did you mean:\nunsigned int clipboardFormat = CF_TEXT;\nclipboardFormat |= CF_UNICODETEXT;\nor:\nclipboardFormat = CF_UNICODETEXT;\n...or something else?\n. If you're refactoring this, maybe you ought to change lstrlen to _tcslen, and lstrcpy(pStr, str2cpy) to _tcscpy_s(pStr, (len2Allocate/sizeof(TCHAR)), str2cpy)?\n. Returning false on all the error conditions, except....actually setting the clipboard data? I guess that's ok, but then why bother checking at 2541?\n. Is anything in Finder being modified? If not, then maybe this could be const? (same for isLineActualSearchResult and prepareStringForClipboard).\n. What's the point of justCreated?\nWhy not set it up at 1759, where it's first declared, i.e.:\nconst bool justCreated = (!_pFinder);\n...is there some way that we create/allocate _pFinder but don't create it?\n. Maybe a strings.reserve(count); would be a good idea here?\n. I don't really agree that these are better. Sure, CharUpper/CharLower are really terrible APIs, but adding more C-style casting just serves to make it more confusing. \nI proposed a patch that included a \"fix\" for this, a while ago, the patch was far too big to have been accepted, but I think that what I did for CharUpper/CharLower was much clearer.\nEssentially what I did was first, extract the low-order word:\nPWSTR fake_lpsz = PWSTR( LOWORD( destStr[ j ] ) );\n...then pass fake_lpsz to CharUpperW:\nPCWSTR const fake_lpsz_result = ::CharUpperW( fake_lpsz );\n....and finally, assigned the value to destStr:\ndestStr[ j ] = LOWORD( fake_lpsz_result );\nThat has the benefit of being explicit - you're saying \"give me that specific word\" instead of \"shove the whole damned thing in a WCHAR, and don't complain if it doesn't fit!\" - thus it's more obviously not a crazy bug. Seriously, it looks insane before and after reading the documentation for CharUpper.\nA screencap, for your convenience:\n\n. > Your patch is a good one, you should propose it as a pull request and in your pull request use better replacement fro this API :)\nWell, however much I liked that patch (it wasn't perfect, but I did like it), it was just far too big for review, and thus never had a chance at merging :)\nBesides, I can't even get single-line changes merged, let alone fixes, or really, much of anything else.\n. (sorry for the three separate posts!)\nSome sort of wrapper function is definitely a good idea, albeit for a different PR. \nreturn (wchar_t)(UINT_PTR)CharUpper((LPWSTR)c);\n...however, still makes my eyes bleed.\nSomething roughly like:\nreturn reinterpret_cast<wchar_t>(reinterpret_cast<UINT_PTR>(CharUpper(reinterpret_cast<LPWSTR>(c))));\n....I think that's just a tiny bit better, because my head doesn't explode (as often) while parsing the expression with C's operator precedence rules.\n\n[...] my head doesn't explode (as often) [...]\n\nYeah, my head is just that volatile. As you might've guessed, I use a LOT of parenthesis.\n. > You can do static_cast to wchar_t.\nLe whoops.\n. > They help the Notepad++ to involve and work better.\nI think you mean \"reduce reliability\" and \"add complexity\" ;)\n. > They help the Notepad++ to involve and work better.\nWhat's really egregious is that, lstrcpy/tcscpy_s for example, are syntactically and semantically equivalent, except lstrcpy does horrible things for no good reason. So there is literally no reason to keep lstrcpy around. \nYet the Pull Request was closed with no explanation.\n. Grr.\n\n. What's msg doing out here? Does it need to persist across loop iterations?

Hang on a second..... You're getting rid of the wchar_t-accepting version? What? How does this even compile??!?\n. Constructing a std::wstring can be quite expensive (it requires a heap allocation for strings more than 8 characters long). Might as well delay construction until actually needed.

Here, you could do:\nif( ( _tcscmp( fd.cFileName, TEXT(\"..\") ) == 0 ) || ( _tcscmp( fd.cFileName, TEXT(\".\") ) == 0 ) )\n...so that in the case that we're in an empty directory, we break out of the loop with only two (stack-allocated) string comparisons. If it's a non-empty directory, this is a faster path for the first result returned.\n. How many levels of indentation are we at here? This control structure is giving me a serious headache.\n. Is Directory::append ever called with a non-member path?\n. Is Directory::read(const generic_string& path, const std::vector<generic_string>& filters) ever called with a non-member path?\n.

How about, instead of setting a member-variable _exists, then calling append (which modifies the value, but also returns void), simply returning a bool from append?\n. Is filetime intended to be an _Out_ parameter? (yes, I think it is?) Mark it _Out_.\nIt's probably also a good idea (when marking it _Out_), to mark Directory::readLastWriteTime as such:\n_Success_( return == true )\nbool Directory::readLastWriteTime(_Out_ FILETIME& filetime) const\n...so that static analysis can pick up misuse of the result (on a failed function call).\n.

As a side effect of the complex control structures, I'm not sure if execution will ever reach the if statement where hFind != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, because that's the condition of the loop itself!

Nitpick:\nThat's a function call in loop bound!\nwhy not:\nconst size_t filtersSize = _filters.size();\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < filtersSize; ++i)\n. Also a nitpick:\nMaybe you ought to check the return value of FindClose, and throw std::runtime_error (or perhaps a throw std::logic_error) on failure?\n. This isn't C89, there's no need to declare variables at the beginning of scope! /grumpy\nDeclare it on line 270, where it's initialized. I don't expect that to be controversial, as it makes the code easier to read.\n. Same here.\n. If you'd like to make this assumption, then maybe you should initialize newFiletime (at 297) like this:\nFILETIME newFiletime = { 0 };\n...as it won't cost you anything, and ensures that even if someone breaks something in readLastWriteTime, this assumption remains true;\n. Nitpick: \nreturn   ( _lastWriteTime.dwLowDateTime   != newFiletime.dwLowDateTime )\n      || (  _lastWriteTime.dwHighDateTime != newFiletime.dwHighDateTime );\n. So, you're checking each object in the entire vector for equality, and then assigning if they're different? Hmm. That might be expensive. It's also not clear if there's any benefit.\n. So, filters is an optional parameter? Probably a good idea to mark it _In_opt_.\n. Oops, you missed a C-style cast here.\n. How many filters are we expecting to be in _filters? If it's small, it might be better to just make a copy, to avoid reference lifetime issues.\n. Is the continue necessary?

The standard guarantees that any pointer will implicitly convert to an equally const/volatile qualified void*. A need to do so explicitly means that there's a bug.\n. Why the catch (...)??

Oops. Yes.\n. Do you also want the old style for \"To build notepad++.exe:\", \"To build SciLexer.dll with boost:\", and \"To build SciLexer.dll _without boost:\"?\n. ScopLexer.dll? What is that? I've never heard of that...\n. Yes. +1 for #354.\n. A FindClose failure in release builds is still a bug. If we ever decide to enable ProcessStrictHandleCheckPolicy (I hope we do!), then handle usage problems will (rightfully) trigger a __fastfail.\nIt's really better to detect things like this - an API that's documented to return a failure code, actually returning a failure code - as soon as possible, so the bug doesn't get swept under the rug!\n. > the return value would have to be or'ed each time\nHuh? You can't do something like:\n```\nconst bool path_appended = append( / function args / );\nif (!path_appended) \n{\n    readLastWriteTime(_lastWriteTime);\n    return false;\n}\nreadLastWriteTime(_lastWriteTime);\nreturn true;\n```\n...?\n\nAdditionally, it is a quick way to compare existing and non-existing directories, and can be accessed via getter.\n\nOk, that I understand.\n. > The assumption that this can not happen is wrong, because a file could be created between the 1st and 2nd iteration. \nOh, yay! Race conditions! So much fun!\nA lot of the code in this function seems like duplicate code, which contributes to confusing problems like that sort of race condition. Surely there's a more elegant way to do it?\n. > The assumption that this can not happen is wrong, because a file could be created between the 1st and 2nd iteration. \nOh, yay! Race conditions! So much fun!\nA lot of the code in this function seems like duplicate code, which contributes to confusing problems like that sort of race condition. Surely there's a more elegant way to do it?\n. Okay, just be careful :)\n. Ah, ok. A bit counterintuitive.\n. For reasons that are beyond me, Notepad++ is compiled with /EHa, which means that catch(...) does all sorts of surprising things - the docs say:\n\nSpecifying /EHa and attempting to handle all exceptions by using catch(...) can be dangerous. In most cases, asynchronous exceptions are unrecoverable and should be considered fatal. Catching them and proceeding can cause process corruption and lead to bugs that are hard to find and fix.\nWhy is this not ok (all other exceptions, also those not from me, will be rethrown)?\n\nBefore anything, I'm assuming that Yuni::MutexLocker doesn't throw. If it does, well...let me know.\nYou're only calling WINAPI functions here, none of which can throw.\nIf Windows raises an SEH exception, then program state is corrupted, and cleanup is nonsensical.\nA catch( std::runtime_error& ) deals with sane errors.\n. Nah, this is ok. But a comment or something would help.\n. Yeah, smart pointers are the way to go.\nJust be careful if you're storing any non-trivial/non-pod object in a std::shared_ptr, as you'll need to use std::enable_shared_from_this, else you'll have all sorts of horrible memory corruption issues.\n. > Imho it probably should be better consistent currently, and refactored in a separate commit for all occurrences?\nNormally, yes..... But this is new code and the Notepad++ devs are, at times, quite hostile to code cleanup/refactoring.\n. I'm sorry for misrepresenting your position. I'm actually quite glad that I'm wrong here. This is very different than the \"no refactoring/cleanup PRs will be accepted!\"  that I've previously encountered.\n. Huh? Are you saying that /EHa isn't enabled? \nI just created a new directory, did a clean git clone, and checked the project settings under \"C++\" (or whatever that section of the property page is called) -> Code Generation, and /EHa was there?\n. _In_reads_ may be controversial.\n.

    "MAPJe71": "-1\nI don't see the relevance/need of the font name and size editable on the toolbar for a programmers / plain text editor.\n. Could you give an example in which the requested feature is used and how it's beneficial?\n. @KrasnayaPloshchad \nSelecting a single or composite font in BabelPad applies that font (and size) to all the text in the opened file. As of that moment the same font (and size) will be applied to any file opened.\nFor example: \n1. open a file of type 'Python script';\n2. apply font e.g. Arial size 12;\n3. open a file of type 'Batch script';\nNotice the font is still Arial size 12 i.e. the font (and size) was not stored based on the file type (as Notepad++ does!).\n@ all\nIMO the requested feature (\"add selectable font type and size to toolbar\") is only relevant for word processors (e.g. MS Word, OpenOffice Writer) which store font information along the actual content of the file. Word processors even support different fonts for different parts of the content. Plain text editors like Notepad++ do none such things. However, Notepad++ stores font information based on file type i.e. file extension.\n. +1\nPatch improves readability.\n. +1\n. Don't fix it when it ain't  broken.\n. Have a look at this plugin Notepad-VisualStudioLineCopy. The source for the .NET/C# variant can be found at Npp-VisualStudio-LineCopy.\nOr, use the Python Script plugin and the appropriate Python script (search for it on the forum) to accomplish the same effect.\n. Where can we find a description of the coding style (hyperlink)?\n. ``` cpp\nfor ( int idxOuter = 0; idxOuter < x; ++idxOuter )\n{\n    int idxInner( 0 ); // outer loop is scope for both idxInner and idxOuter\n    for ( ; idxInner < maxFirst; ++idxInner )\n    {\n        cout << idxInner;\n    }\n... // some code\n\nidxInner = 0; // reuse counter, reset when required\nfor ( ; idxInner < maxSecond; ++idxInner )\n{\n    cout << idxInner;\n}\n\n}\n```\n.

Be aware that Notepad++ uses an adapted Scintilla (indicated by 'for Notepad++' in the file's version).\nSome of the changes are:\n- Added the 'Search Result'-, 'Objective-C'- and 'User Defined Language'-lexers.\n- Adapted HTML lexer to default to Visual Basic Script i.s.o. JavaScript for ASP embedded script.\n- Added possibility for PCRE search which depends on Boost::RegEx.\nSo simply compiling the latest Scintilla revision source without any change might work but it probably won't give you back all of Notepad++'s functionality.\n. Oops! wrong direction\n. Still getting used to Git (and TortoiseGit).\nBeen using SVN (and TortoiseSVN) for several years now which was a huge improvement over Visual SourceSafe.\n. Case sensitive vs. insensitive sort?\n. You could also use an 'option' menu entry for enable/disable ascending sort to reduce the number of entries e.g. \n:\n   Split Lines\n   Join Lines\n   Move Up Current Lines\n   Move Down Current Lines\n    :\n   Insert Blank Line Above Current\n   Insert Blank Line Blow Current\n----------------------------------------- (SEPARATOR)\n   Sort Lines Lexicographically\n   Sort Lines Integer\n   Sort Lines Decimal (comma)\n   Sort Lines Decimal (dot)\n----------------------------------------- (SEPARATOR)\nv  Sort Ascending\nv  Sort Case Insensitive\n. @andreas-jonsson  I would rename 'Edit > Sort Lines' to 'Edit > Sort Operations'.\n. Yep, it 'sounds' better. \nWe should have a closer look at the other sub menus to e.g.\nCopy to Clipboard > Current Full File path to Clipboard\n                    Current Filename to Clipboard\n                    Current Dir. Path to Clipboard\nIndent > Increase Line Indent\n         Decrease Line Indent\nLine Operations > Duplicate Current Line\n                  Split Lines\n                  Join Lines\n                  Move Up Current Line\n                  Move Down Current Line\n                  etc.\nshould then IMO be:\nCopy to Clipboard > Current File's Full Path\n                    Current File's Name\n                    Current File's Directory Path\nIndent > Increase\n         Decrease\nLine Operations > Duplicate Current\n                  Split\n                  Join\n                  Move Up Current\n                  Move Down Current\nBut this should probably be a separate PR.\n. Uhm, also if the menu only contains 'settings' how do you actually start a sort?\n. Might be best to check in both hives i.e. SkyDrive and OneDrive for the MS Cloud.\n.

As TypeScript is a super set of JavaScript wouldn't associating TypeScript files with the JavaScript lexer address your issue?\n.

I guess this is an issue for the Notepad++ Plugin Development forum on SourceForge.\n. @eldaw the technical incorrectness of the code could easily be the cause for some of the bugs.\n. First of all, any introduced code should be technically correct!\nSecond, addressing the technical incorrectness of the code should not depend on addressing reported bugs, usability enhancements, and functional enhancements solely.\n. Hmm, missed that one and yes it is.\n. @milipili could you and/or @donho share some info on the big picture, refactoring and maybe the time-line?\n. Yes, there probably should have been entries in the language.xml files.\nThe text blocks are the Notepad++ 'Easter eggs'.

The original issue is about Function List not correctly parsing Java files containing AutoDoc.

My screenshot was about the second issue\n\nA similar problem happens with PHP function marked as static.\n\n2335 didn't (or at least should not have) any impact on the functionality for the majority of the parsers.\nAn obvious mistake with the Python parser was fixed. So testing with before and after #2335 will have the same effect for the PHP parser, as you discovered.. Debug Info?\n. In Notepad++ open ? menu, select Debug Info, select Copy debug info into clipboard.\nPost clipboard contents as a comment below :)\n. You need to HTML-encode the less-then character within an attribute value, like so: (?&lt;=function).\nFurthermore, the parser needs more corrections.. Aha thanx, now I get it ... you combined the return values of BGM_GETPROTECTION and BGM_GETTYPE and added it as return value for BGM_GETCELLDATA.\nFYI:\nbuffer[0] .. buffer[4]      row number\nbuffer[5]                   hyphen as field separator\nbuffer[6] .. buffer[9]      column number\nbuffer[9]                   pipe character as field separator\nbuffer[10]                  protection indicator either 'P' (protected) or 'U' (unprotected)\nbuffer[11]                  data type indicator one of 'A' (alpha i.e. text), 'N' (numeric), 'T' (boolean true), 'F' (boolean false) and 'G' (graphic)\nbuffer[12]                  pipe character as field separator\nbuffer[13] .. buffer[n]     cell data\n. Why not call it NPP_PARENT_DIRECTORY then?\nWhy not use \"..\" to go up one directory?\ne.g.\n$(NPP_DIRECTORY)\\..\\App1\\App1.exe [params]\n$(NPP_DIRECTORY)\\..\\App2\\App2.exe [params]\n. Add the following to your FunctionList.xml and restart Notepad++\nIn the -node:\n<association langID=\"57\" id=\"json_syntax\" />\nIn the -node:\n<parser id=\"json_syntax\" displayName=\"JSON for MongoDb import\" commentExpr=\"(?m-s)#.*?$\" >\n    <function mainExpr=\"&quot;_id&quot;\\s*:\\s*&quot;[\\w]+&quot;\\s*,\" >\n      <functionName>\n        <nameExpr expr=\":\\s*&quot;\\K[\\w]+\" />\n      </functionName>\n    </function>\n  </parser>\n. It would be nice if you let us know whether the parser worked for you and when so you can close the issue.\nThanx\n. Sorry @chcg, apparently I forgot to do a search for possible duplicates first.\n. AFAIK there's no PHP coding involved in Notepad++ so I don't understand where you'd want to add/modify.\nFurthermore, inquiries and discussions are more suited for the Community IMO.\n. I read the title. It appears to be to cryptically for me :)\n. Is the fix still correct for a string like\n$text = \"this string ends after the backtick ``\"\n. Possibly a duplicate of #1006 which was solved with pull request for #1923.\n. This (as I presume feature request) can already be achieved with available functionality:\n- Put the cursor at the very top of the document, make sure you selected down for direction, select 'Find Next' to find the first match.\n- Put the cursor at the very end of the document, make sure you selected up for direction, select 'Find Next' to find the last match.\n. A bit off-topic here ;) but here's link to my functionList.xml.\n. @donho \nAll parsers should be compatible. Unfortunately most of the changed official-release/stock parsers appear not to be functional. At the time they were changed I used Scintilla 3.56 with Boost 1.58 for use with my FunctionList patch. More recent changes to the stock parsers (see date tags in file) are done with official release Notepad++.\nUnless you want a sh!t load of complaints about FunctionList do NOT USE my functionList.xml AS IS. ;)\n. I advise you NOT to use my functionList.xml as is.\nSome parsers are improved IMO e.g. Batch / Command Shell, INI Section and Python;\nSome are added and optimized for my use e.g. XML Function List\nSome are possibly improved (possibly because I did not get a response yet for validation) e.g. #1919;\nSome are added to be able to help others e.g. #2045, Community #9725, Community #12126;\nSome are optimized for my SourceForge #548 patch and do not work correctly without it i.e. not functional;\nI do not use all the parsers myself, the ones I do use regularly function of course ;) (i.e. Batch / Command Shell, INI Section, Python and XML Function List).\n. @donho \n\n... do a PR for the parsers ...\n\nSure no problem.\nDo you mean an explanation for the improvements or the regular expressions or both?\n\nRegarding SF's PR ...\n\nYep, I figured that would have been the case. There's a contributing guideline now ;)\nI will create a separate PR for this and include the optimized parsers which dependent on this patch (with explanatory comment, before/after comparison)\n. Might be a Scintilla problem as it also occurs in SciTE.\nNotepad++ v3.9.2\n\nSciTE v3.6.6\n\n. IMO yes as the width of the fields in the status bar depend on dpi, content and for textual content also on language and font.\n. Don't think the font is the biggest hurdle, it's just part of the equation :)\nIMO using a fixed pitch font and discarding the other variables is a short term work around,  not a real solution.\n. You could contribute :)\n. You're right, one can't.\nBut as far as I can tell no one else seems to think the issue is worth their time to address it. \nIMO posting the issue multiple times doesn't help either.\n. Low level yes but...\n- does not make it very readable.\n- implicit type conversion(s)\n. Why the weird return value?\nAccording to this help the function is supposed to return a value of type int for SM_CYFRAME (or maybe better SM_CYSIZEFRAME) representing the thickness of the sizing border around the perimeter of a window that can be resized, in pixels.\nSo my question is: is it a resizable frame i.e. is the correct metric retrieved?\nIn addition to 'true' vs '1':\nWhen the return value represents Boolean data a nonzero value is considered true and a zero value is considered false. Most of the Windows functions that return Boolean data return a value of type BOOL (TRUE or FALSE) which is different from the C++ native type bool (true or false).\nint reply = ::GetSystemMetrics( SM_DBCSENABLED);\nif (reply != 0) // using 'if (reply)' would add an implicit type conversion (int --> bool)\n    // User32.dll w/ DBCS support\nelse\n    // User32.dll w/o DBCS support\nCould be written as...\nBOOL reply = ::GetSystemMetrics( SM_DBCSENABLED);\nif (reply == TRUE) // using 'if (reply)' would add an implicit type conversion (int --> bool)\n    // User32.dll w/ DBCS support\nelse\n    // User32.dll w/o DBCS support\nor as...\nbool isEnabled = (TRUE == ::GetSystemMetrics( SM_DBCSENABLED));\nif (isEnabled)\n    // User32.dll w/ DBCS support\nelse\n    // User32.dll w/o DBCS support\n. > The return value is correct for other windows ...\nI have no idea, yet. Makes it a bigger challenge finding out though ;)\nMaybe the returned values are correct. Does the TaskList look wrong without the correction? Probably yes, otherwise you wouldn't have applied the correction.\nI would check for it myself but I'm currently not able to compile the application and see the differences.\n\n... I assume it is safe to simply decrement the return value.\n\nAssumptions are always BAD, at some point in time they will bite you in the a...\nThese should always be well documented (as you did)!\n\nIn addition to 'true' vs '1': ...\n\nI was not sure you were aware, just discard it.\nAlthough, IMO it's 'bad' when it raises confusion/questions, degrades readability despite raising neither errors nor warnings by compiler :)\n.

The Boost library path \n(-LIBPATH:c:\\sources\\boost_1_55_0\\bin.v2\\libs\\regex\\build\\msvc-12.0\\release\\address-model-64link-static\\runtime-link-static\\threading-multi) is missing a backslash between 64 and link.\nDidn't squash commits yet but will squash and force into one commit for easy integration once it's issue free, if that's OK with you.\n. @cmeriaux :+1: :smile: \nYes, I'm aware, it's not the reason the build failed.\nBased on all the AppVeyor YAML examples got the impression that YAML required 2 space indentation. YAML specifies one must not use tabs for indentation and ...\n\nEach node must be indented further than its parent node. All sibling nodes must use the exact same indentation level. However the content of each sibling node may be further indented independently.\n\nWorking on the issues in a separate branch now, will update soon.\n. FYI:\n- Used the following (corrected) .editorconfig (w/ EditorConfig plugin) to ensure correct indentation style and size:\nYAML\nroot = true\n[*] \nindent_style=tab\nend_of_line=crlf\n[*.yml]\nindent_style=space\nindent_size=4\n- Used following commands to update PR: \n``` Bash\ngit checkout master\ngit fetch --all\ngit rebase -i upstream/master\nchanged all \"pick\" to \"squash\" and used \":quit!\" to exit VIm\ngit push origin master -f\n```\n. @donho \nI posted a question/contemplation in the Notepad 7 Release Candidate announcement and was asked to do a PR that would be checked.\nI'm able to build Boost in 64-bit on my development system but I am not able to build or execute 64-bit Scintilla and Notepad++ with my development system i.e. it's a 32-bit system.\nThe last commit was build utilizing AppVeyor to build 32-bit and 64-bit, both with Boost v1.58.\nCopied the 32-bit Release artifacts to my system and didn't notice any problems using them.\n. @chcg Good catch!\n. from MapViewOfFile documentation ...\n\nReserved and committed pages are released when the view is unmapped and the file mapping object is closed. For details, see the UnmapViewOfFile and CloseHandle functions.\n\nfrom UnmapViewOfFile documentation ...\n\nUnmapping a mapped view of a file invalidates the range occupied by the view in the address space of the process and makes the range available for other allocations.\n\nWhen I read this correctly you're required to unmap the view in order to release the occupied memory for reuse i.e. you'd run out of memory otherwise. \nSee also Creating a View Within a File for an example.\n. Yep, mixed it up with the title in the context menu.\nBut keeping both Don's e-mail and the free (GNU) source code editor text increases the chance of the PR being accepted e.g.\nresource\nVALUE    \"Comments\",           \"Notepad++ : a free (GNU) source code editor\\0\"\nVALUE    \"CompanyName\",        \"Don HO don.h@free.fr\\0\"\nVALUE    \"FileDescription\",    \"Notepad++\\0\"\n. @donho \nThe  Edit with Notepad++-entry in the context-menu as can be seen in @vlakoff 's screenshot above is fine by me. For the entry in the Open with-sub-context-menu and/or window it would be nice to shorten the  Notepad++ : a free (GNU) source code editor-description to Notepad++ but is of no/less importance to me.\n. If I remember correctly this has been issued before (i.e. duplicate) but can't remember the number.\n@martbase \nThere are plugins that implement this functionality (neither are available through the PluginManager):\n- Mackenzie Zastrow's VisualStudioLineCopy plugin (C++ Win32)\n- Kasper B.

Have a look at EditorConfig.\n. One commit per PR!\nSee post by @cmeriaux to solve.\n. Find Next enables you to skip occurrences when you iterate through the document.\n. So that would mean you'd have to switch to the \"Find\" tab every time you want to skip a replacement, not very convenient.\nMaybe the functionality of the Find Next button would be more clear if it read e.g. Skip Replacement.\n. Do you have Remember current session for next launch enabled?\n(Can be found in menu Settings, sub-menu Preferences..., item Backup, group Session snapshot and periodic backup)\n. IMO binaries in a repository are security liability but sometimes you can't get around them e.g. 3rd party libraries/tools. In this case the source is part of the project so I'd say build it during the build process but I'll leave that decision to @donho.\n. Notepad++ build already has two dependencies, the Boost and Scintilla libraries, so it shouldn't be a problem for the AppVeyor build environment.\nFurthermore, I don't see a procedural difference in building an executable from NSIS script source or C++ source.\n. >Both versions should be able to run in parallel with roaming profiles.\nI'm running both 32 and 64 bit Notepad++ sharing one configuration folder (roaming profile). The plugin DLL's are in the applicable Notepad++\\plugins folder under Program Files (x86) and Program Files respectively.. >This is not correct!\nIt's correct, just not your usecase :smile:\n\nThan they conflict.\n\nAs expected. Having both 32 and 64 bit Notepad++ installed with \"per user\" plugins is not considered a typical usecase so don't expect a solution anytime soon.\nBe creative, try to find a work-around e.g. use a batch script which swaps the DLL's prior to starting N++.. >The developer of the software is aware of this feature.\nWhat feature exactly?\n\nJust move the dlls in a x86/x64 subfolder and all is good.\n\nNot really. \nTo run both architectures with plugin's in the user's APPDATA folder (roaming profile) N++ needs be (made) aware the DLL's have moved and where they have been moved to.\n\nMoving to disable is already implemented...\n\nYes, in the installer/setup not in N++ itself.\n\nI'd like to switch all our users to x64.\n\nMy bad, I misread your earlier posts as the dual-architecture-with-roaming-profiles being the problem.\nYour problem is a failed 32-to-64-bit migration.\nYes, the installer could use some improvement there.\nAlternative migration scenario:\n1. backup configuration files;\n2. uninstall N++ (any installed architecture);\n3. install 64 bit N++;\n4. optionally restore configuration files. Restore configuration files is optional here as the (un-)installer already has an option to keep the user-data.\n. >The feature you may have not heard about is...\nYes, I'm aware of this \"allowAppDataPlugins\" feature.\n\n...that is a redirected folder on several file servers around the world.\n\nNot in general, but at least in your and/or your customers usecase.\n\nI think that notepad++ moves unstable addons to disabled when they crashed, isn't it?\n\nNo, the Notepad++ NSIS setup moves the plugins known to be unstable.\n\nI'm the maintainer of Notepad++ MSI setup...\nThe setup cannot solve this problem as the setup runs as SYSTEM and NOT in the context of our 500 notepad++ users.\nThis is a large enterprise installation... not a home user install.\n\nValuable information to be able to solve your problem.\n\nNothing against your funny workaround ideas...\n\nThey were not intended to be funny. I was just trying to help (based on the info provided), but glad you liked them.. Maybe NSIS' InitPluginsDir and $PLUGINSDIR created some confusion (at least for me it did) with Notepad++' Plugins directory, they are not related.\n. Please search the existing issues next time first.\nThe PluginManager and many of the other plugins are not available in 64-bit yet.\n. The highlight of the links might just indicate that you have Clickable Link Settings enabled.\nDouble click on a link and the applicable page is opened in your default browser.\nTo copy the link: select the link text (left-mouse-down just before left most character of link text, drag mouse to right side of right most character in link text, let go of mouse button) and use Ctrl+C or context-menu's copy.\n. Then it wouldn't be a validator anymore, but yeah I was thinking about that too.\nWhy not have a script that converts all the language files to structure of a reference file (english.xml) i.e. remove over complete entries and add dummies for missing entries?\n. @donho I always interpreted \"validating XML\" as checking for a valid structure of XML text i.e. checking for required and optional elements, their attributes, amounts, type, etc. using e.g. XML Schema.\nIMO this kind of validating is desirable, is still viable and should not be limited to the language files only (eventually expand to all XML files).\nConcerning checking for valid/complete language data of a PR the script could still be used after some changes. As (more or less) suggested in my previous post:\n\n\"Why not have a script that converts all the language files i.e. remove excess elements and add dummies for missing elements using the english.xml as a template\"\n\nThe script could log a summary in stead of every issue to limit the number of errors.\nPer file:\n1. Required: a \"Pass/Fail\"-flag to indicate whether or not the file requires additional translations. The applicable elements were copied from the english.xml-template to make it easier to find them;\n2. Optional:\n- On Fail: the number of additional translations required, acting as a \"checksum\" for the translator.\n- The number of excess elements that were automatically removed.\nI created an XML Schema file functionList.xsd for functionList.xml and use it in conjunction with XMLStarlet and the Notepad++ XMLTools Plugin.\nKeep in mind I'm not an Schema expert.\n. It is not a regression, the author decided to have the icon removed and as a result the option in the installer is removed.\nIf you really want the obsolete icon in your environment there are other ways. Beside the registry \"hacks\" you already mentioned there are ways to patch the executable e.g. with tools like ResourceHacker, ResEdit and Anolis Resourcer.\n. Just for anyone who reads this topic and is wondering what the whining is all about ... old vs. new in the sizes 48x48, 32x32 and 16x16, all in True Color + Alpha channel (32 bits).\n| Old image | New image |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n. @andyxxl TextFX plugin is not available in/for 64 bit..

This make me wonder if they are still used. \n@donho \nAre these console tools still in use?\nWhen no longer in use: wouldn't it be better to remove them from the repository?\nWhen still in use: should they be converted to Unicode tools?\n. Set Search Mode to Normal?\n. @xalalau FYI the misspelled translation i.e. your bonus was already fixed.\n. After fiddling around with the Style Configurator it appears that ...\n- the first TAG (i.e. 0%, SciTE's style.css.1 a.k.a. \"Selector (HTML tag)\") is styled as an UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER (i.e. SciTE's style.css.7 a.k.a. \"Unknown Property\");\n- the first IDENTIFIER (i.e. opacity, SciTE's style.css.6 a.k.a. \"CSS1 Property\") is styled as an OPERATOR (i.e. SciTE's style.css.5 a.k.a. \"Operator\").\nI suspect the Scintilla CSS lexer is causing the problem.\n\n. @kauba Shortcut to the XML Tools Plugin issues list.\n. Just apply/commit the changes, it will make it easier to review them.\n. C parser has been updated with \"Function List Update 2\".\nPHP and JavaScript parsers will be updated with \"Function List Update 3\", will include changes as proposed in this PR.. I guess separate PR's would have been better.\nFurthermore, why add a separate style for \"USER DEFINED\" keywords when it is already possible to enter user-defined keywords as part of the \"KEYWORDS\" style?. I try to base a languages parser on its grammar. When I can't find a/the grammar I use gathered source files and presume they are proper examples knowing the latter is not always the case. Furthermore, I'm not familiar with every language and their quirks so any comment to improve a parser is appreciated.\n@DonHo\nNSIS:\nWhen the functions contained in a macro are indented it will show the macro only.\nNSIS\n!macro define_detectVersionToInstall threadid\n    Var common_15\n    Function detectVersionToInstall\n        Pop $common_15\n    FunctionEnd\n    Function detectVersionToInstall_${threadid}\n        ${If} $VER != \"noVersion\"\n            return\n        ${EndIf}\n    FunctionEnd\n!macroend\nQ: How should functions contained in a macro be listed?\n1. separately (i.e. in addition to the macro itself);\nNSIS\n    [-] example.nsi\n     +--- define_detectVersionToInstall threadid\n     +--- detectVersionToInstall\n     \\--- detectVersionToInstall_${threadid}\n2. as 'members/leafs' of a macro 'class/branch'.\nNSIS\n    [-] example.nsi\n     \\---[-] define_detectVersionToInstall threadid\n          +--- detectVersionToInstall\n          \\--- detectVersionToInstall_${threadid}\nC:\nMacros are a PITA :) I'll have another look.\nJava:\nOops, will update.\nAnd yes I agree FunctionList should only display definitions.\n.

It's offset by one character hence the additional character required.\nA white space (i.e. tab, space or newline) is the most practical to use.. The C parser is a function-only parser and the Java parser is a classRange-only parser.\nA function parser tries to match the specified function expression throughout the complete text of a file whereas a classRange parser tries to match the specified function expression within the range of a \"class\" i.e. part of the text of a file. The boundaries of the range are determined using the specified openSymbole and closeSymbole.\n\nThe problem occurs due to a fault in the way Function List determines the boundary of a regular expression search result.

Are these files targeted by the Contrab lexer?. Install Customize Toolbar plugin.. For example:\nA developer contributes to three open source projects and each requires different settings for indentation. The first project requires tabs with a width equivalent to four spaces, the second project requires tabs with a width equivalent to eight spaces and the third project requires 4 spaces for each indent. The developer has a hard time remembering to apply the correct settings to the IDE/editor for each project, especially when frequently switching between the projects. \nWouldn't it be nice/handy if the required settings are applied automatically when opening the project in its IDE or even better, opening any file from the project's tree in his favorite text editor?\nIt is possible by using EditorConfig. It's not a tool it's a file format for defining coding styles, is natively supported by e.g. GitHub, TortoiseGit and Visual Studio and supported through a plugin by e.g. Code::Blocks, Emacs, Notepad++ and Visual Studio Code.\nThe developer has added an .editorconfig file to the root of each project. Each file with the project specific settings. He no longer needs to remember to change settings when switching projects nor does he need to remember/lookup which project requires which settings. Each (upstream) project could benefit from having their .editorconfig file in the repository as it enables style consistency among its contributors (and less annoyance for the project owner \ud83d\ude09 ).. BTW existing whitespace is not effected, .editorconfig settings only apply to new files and edited lines of existing files.. Hi @donho ,\nThe \"left and right quotes\" update to the XML parser applies to the dedicated \"Function List\" parser only. It makes sure both quotes surrounding a displayName- or an id-attribute are of the same \"type\" i.e. both single quotes or both double quotes. I updated the comment above.\nAllthough (in retrospect) this \"test\"/\"pre-condition\" is more suitable to be part of the functionList.xml file validation.\nI've been contemplating about unit tests myself.\nImplementing new parsers is time consuming (or at least the way I do it) especially when they result in changes to existing parsers while preventing regressions. I've collected a set of \"test\" source files for about 200 different \"languages\" to help me with that (no I don't have a parser for every of these languages \ud83d\ude04 ). Implementing the functionList.xsd was actually the first step to get some test environment going.\nMy idea for Function List automated tests involves the Test Anything Protocol and Lua scripts using the standalone interpreter and/or the LuaScript plugin. \nA test could consist of e.g.:\n1. loading a source file in Notepad++, have Function List parse and \"dump\" the list, compare the dumped list with the expected list for that source file;\n1. having a Lua script generate the source in the editor, \"read\" the list and compare it with the expected list for the generated code.\nThe expected list needs to be \"connected\" to its source file, these could be separate files but I prefer one file as not to loose their connection e.g. as comment in the source file (for example 1) or as part of the script (for example 2).\nDo you already use some test system for (other parts of) Notepad++ or have any ideas?\n. @donho \nQuestions / Remarks:\n1. Why not have Notepad++ export the parse results and have the test logic (i.e. compare export with expected result) in a script or separate executable? Or is it required to have the test logic within Notepad++?\n2. Do you have any objections on implementing the tests using scripts?\n3. When required (see 1) will it only be included in the Debug build to not enlarge the Release build executable?\n4. When having more tests implemented in the future for other parts of Notepad++ I would redefine the arguments in order not to \"polute\" the CLI to much e.g.\nnotepad++.exe -test=funcList,L_CPP,msgboxOn,errLogOn,c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.result c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.cpp\n5. When not required (see 1) i.e. export the parse results, the command line interface (CLI) could be changed/simplified to\nnotepad++.exe -export=funcList c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.cpp\n6. To what extend/level is a test to validate a parser? Just the end result i.e. the tree as visual by a user, separate class parser and function parser results in a mixed parser, detecting comment sections, all of them?\nad.5. my preference \ud83d\ude04 \nad.6. the comment sections part of the parser is not explicitly visible in the tree but I think we should be able to validate it separately.. @donho \n\nBy \"export\", do you mean write the strings into a file?\n\nYes, though I just realized we'd have to decide on a file format too e.g. XML (as already used within N++), JSON, YAML.\n\n...anyone test his/her RE very easily (for example, for user languages).\n\nThey could also easily compare the exported file with an expected result file using any diff/compare tool. The files would preferably have the same fileformat though.\n\nwe need LangID still..\n\nGood point, agreed.\n\nWe do need scripting to execute every unit test anyway.\n\nDo you have a preference for a scripting language or maybe a preference which not to use?. @donho \n\n...the 2nd draft...\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to have the file extension of the result/export file reflect the used file format?\ne.g.\nc:\\funcListTests\\cppTestResult.json\nor to also reflect the command line parameter\nc:\\funcListTests\\cppTestExport.json\n\nWhat is your suggestion?\n\nThe ones that come to mind are JavaScript, Lua, Perl, PowerShell, Python and VBScript. My first choice was Python, my second Lua. But then I remembered AutoHotkey and AutoIt. They support automated GUI testing out of the box which might be handy. Needs more research. But whatever the language I'd probably end up using some Command Shell scripts (i.e. batch files) too.\nAutoHotkey\n Pros\n  * Automated GUI testing\n  * Unit Testing framework available\n Cons\n  * Needs to be installed\n  * Knowledge/support within community unknown\n  * TAP producer available?\n  * For MS Windows only\nAutoIt\n Pros\n  * Automated GUI testing\n  * Unit Testing framework available (sort of)\n Cons\n  * Needs to be installed\n  * Knowledge/support within community unknown\n  * TAP producer available?\n  * For MS Windows only\nJavaScript\n Pros\n  * Interpreter natively available on Windows \n  * Unit Testing framework available\n  * TAP producer available\n  * Notepad++ plugin available\n Cons \n  * Knowledge/support within community unknown  \nKiXtart\n Pros\n  * ?\n Cons\n  * Needs to be installed\n  * Knowledge/support within community unknown\n  * TAP producer available?\n  * For MS Windows only\nLua\n Pros\n  * Basic interpreter has small footprint \n  * Knowledge/support available within community\n  * Unit Testing framework available\n  * TAP producer available\n  * Notepad++ plugin available\n Cons\n  * Needs to be installed\n  * Limited functionality of basic interpreter\nPerl\n Pros\n  * Unit Testing framework available\n  * TAP producer available\n Cons\n  * Needs to be installed e.g. ActivePerl\n  * Steep learning curve \n  * Knowledge/support within community unknown\n  * Large footprint\nPowerShell\n Pros\n  * Interpreter natively available on Windows \n  * Unit Testing framework available\n  * TAP producer available\n Cons \n  * Steep learning curve \n  * Knowledge/support within community unknown\n  * Only available on Windows?\nPython\n Pros\n  * Knowledge/support available within community\n  * Unit Testing framework available\n  * TAP producer available\n  * Notepad++ plugin available\n Cons \n  * Needs to be installed e.g. ActivePython \n  * Large footprint\nVBScript\n Pros\n  * Interpreter natively available on Windows \n  * Unit Testing framework available\n Cons \n  * Knowledge/support within community unknown\n  * Only available on Windows?\nEdit: added KiXtart, AutoIt and AutoHotkey.. @donho \n\nPlease let me know if there are somethings missing.\n\nIt appears that only the leaves of the tree are exported.\n\n. @dinkumoil \nI will only update this PR for corrections/changes on already included parsers.\n@donho \njson\n{\n    \"root\":\"lesDlgs.cpp\",\n    \"branches\":[\n        {\n            \"name\":\"ValueDlg\",\n            \"leaves\":[\n                \"init\",\n                \"doDialog\",\n                \"reSizeValueBox\",\n                \"run_dlgProc\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\":\"ButtonDlg\",\n            \"leaves\":[\n                \"doDialog\",\n                \"run_dlgProc\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    \"leaves\":[\n        \"func1\",\n        \"func2\"\n    ]\n}. @donho \nWhen talking about a \"tree\" it might be better to replace root with trunk instead.\nto-may-to - to-mah-to, I'll leave it up to you.. @donho \nHurdles:\n1. It's not a JavaScript interpreter that is natively available on Windows but a JScript interpreter. Allthough JScript and JavaScript both are based on ECMAScript spec, they are of different generations, Microsoft JScript is based on an older spec and thus its interpreter can not handle the JavaScript scripts written with a newer spec in mind. E.g. JScript does not have a build-in \"include/import/require\" function. It is possible to define an \"include/import/require\" function to be able to use \"library\" scripts, but I think it will be a challenge for maintenance. We could use a standalone JavaScript interpreter (e.g. see list here) but this would mean a/another third party dependency for N++ (well at least for testing).\n2. I get easily sidetracked :-D\n3. Life happens\nWhat do I have:\n1. a basic concept of the test harness;\n2. some batch scripts for the test harness (e.g. \"createSandbox.cmd\" to create an isolated test environment);\n3. a JScript to validate the functionList.xml using available schema functionList.xsd;\n4. a JScript \"include/import/require\" function;\nTodo:\n1. an \"isEqual\" function for JSON objects that does a \"deep compare\";\n2. functionality to easily check/get/set N++ configuration options/settings for a test;\n3. tests for the available programming languages;\n4. schema files for N++ language/options/settings files: config.xml, langs.xml, stylers.xml, userDefineLang.xml, contextMenu.xml, localization*.xml;\n. @donho From http://editorconfig.org/:\n\nEditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.\n\ne.g. all other projects I work on use spaces for indentation, the .editorconfig file makes sure it's set to tabs for Notepad++.. Never mind. Can't you use bookmarks for this?. See also community topic 12944.\n. See Scintilla item 1943.. Google translate:\n\nHello @donho in fact this is quite complex\nNormally a little-endian UTF-16 encoded file starts with 0xFF 0xFE (called BOM) but in the commented code we try to identify a little-endian UTF-16 encoded file even if it does not contain a BOM .\n2 cases are possible:\n- if a hexa file is identified to twist as UTF-16 LE without BOM then it will be displayed incorrectly (as can be seen in # 2692)\nNote: If the # 2692 file is opened in scintilla it is displayed correctly.\n- if the file is a real file \"UTF-16 without BOM\" it will no longer be displayed such as ...\nThere is indeed a choice to make.\nIt is also possible to see that this pb appeared for \"try to detect UTF-16 big-endian without BOM\" ==> and the code has been commented out.\nPerhaps it would be necessary to modify the code and to propose 2 options d\u00e9sactivables:\n- try to detect UTF-16 big-endian without BOM\n- try to detect UTF-16 big-little without BOM\n\nand\n\nFinally it is better to find another solution to solve this problem # 2692 and keep the current mechanism of detection of UTF-16 big-little without BOM. Did you try replacing the , with \\r\\n?. The search direction option is no longer needed as the single \"find\" button has been replaced by two buttons i.e. \"<< Find\" and \"Find Next\" (see your screenshot).. @powdermnky007 No.. I have done the following:\n1. installed the LuaScript plugin;\n2. added the following snippet to startup.lua:\nlua\nnpp.AddShortcut(\"Toggle Doc Switcher\", \"\", function()\n    npp:ShowDocSwitcher( not npp:IsDocSwitcherShown() )\nend)\n3. installed the Customize Toolbar plugin;\n4. \"created\" a toolbar icon Toolbar-DocSwitcher.bmp: \n\n\nadded the following line to CustomizeToolbar.btn:\nPlugins,LuaScript,Toggle Doc Switcher,,Toolbar-DocSwitcher.bmp\n\nNote: only possible for Notepad++ 32-bit as the Customize Toolbar plugin is not available for Notepad++ 64-bit (AFAIK).\n  . My compact language menu looks like this:\n\n. Uhm, misleading title because that's not the compact language menu you changed ;)\nBTW the compact language menu already contains both fixed and free Fortran form.. No, it's because the string contains \"*/\".. The language file needs to be updated to translate \"<< Find\" and \"Find >>\".. >I have been using Notepad++ (v7.5) for a few days now\nLOL v7.5 has been released only a few hours ago.. See #18, #1854, Community topic 13732 or add the following snippet to the startup.lua script for the LuaScript plugin:\n```lua\n-- Mimic Visual Studio's \"Ctrl+C\" that copies the entire line if nothing is selected\nnpp.AddShortcut(\"Copy Allow Line\", \"Ctrl+C\", function()\n    editor:CopyAllowLine()\nend)\n-- Mimic Visual Studio's \"Ctrl+X\" that cuts the line if nothing is selected\nnpp.AddShortcut(\"Cut Allow Line\", \"Ctrl+X\", function()\n    if editor.SelectionEmpty then\n        editor:CopyAllowLine()\n        editor:LineDelete()\n    else\n        editor:Cut()\n    end\nend)\n```\n.

Duplicate of #1359 and #3136.. >I will do that after my holidays.\n\ud83d\udc4d Enjoy your holdays!\n\nDo you also need a file with the expected results of the parser?\n\n\ud83d\udc4d That would be great!\nTry notepad++.exe -noPlugin -export=functionList \"E:\\ParserTest.pas\" and make sure your \"active\" functionList.xml contains your Pascal/Delphi parser (yes obvious but had me puzzled).\n. @dinkumoil \n\nI was not able to write regular expressions which are suitable for all features and coding variants of the Delphi language.\n\nYou could write a parser for each coding variant and activate just one with the right association.\nIt has already been done for Haskell (3 parsers: normal, literate and literate for LaTeX), COBOL (2 parsers: fixed and free form reference format) and Fortran (2 parsers: fixed and free form style; allthough also two language ID's).\n\nit`s worth to think about the whole concept of a parser engine based on regular expressions.\n\nIMO the regular expressions itself are not the root problem, it's more the Function List engine, how it uses RE's and expectations of users (compared to other editors and IDE's with a tag/function list implementation).\n\nIn the issue tracker one can find a lot of entries concerning malfunctions of various language parsers.\n\nYep, I'm trying to work on them as much as possible but it takes time.. Single commit per PR is preferred (especially when they are not directly related) and in its own branch..

I thought I applied the necessary changes to the parser above. Applied the changes: extended <functionName> nodes with option to display function and procedures with or without parameters by adding an additional filter.. Why not use \"Find\" (Ctrl+F) or \"Incremental Search\" (Ctrl+Alt+I)?. Please include before and after screendump for easy comparison.. Have tried to create a macro and assign a shortcut to it?. > I would say it is basic feature people can't program without.\nFYI people have been programming for decades without the feature.\nI guess this is one of those features that causes more problems/confusion when not implemented correctly.\n. When corrected to (removed one backslash)...\nFind what: (\\Q<StartLayout\\E\\s(?:(?:.|\\R)*?)>)(?:(?:.|\\R)*?)(\\Q</StartLayout>\\E)\nReplace with: $1$2\nit seems to work just fine.. Please close issue as it's not a bug.. Notepad++ uses the Boost::RegEx library v1.55 which interprets \\> as a special character meaning assert position at the end of a word.\nIf you wanted the \\> to be interpreted exactly as a > you should have just used >, no need for the backslash i.e. escape character. Not a bug nor a missing feature, just incorrect use of NPP's RegEx.. See also #3469 and #3200.. You could change this issue into a change request to have the whitespace symbol size configurable :). ```lua\n-- Startup script\n-- Changes will take effect once Notepad++ is restarted\nlocal nppVersion = tonumber( (npp.Version >> 16) .. '.' .. (npp.Version & 0xff) )\nlocal editors = { editor1, editor2 }\nfor _,editorX in pairs(editors) do\n    if nppVersion >= 7.4 then\n        -- make the space 'dots' less intrusive/hurtful to the eyes\n        editorX.WhitespaceSize = 1\n    end\nend\n```. Or maybe an XML Schema file?. See also #2924. > 3. Move 3 tabs to a new window.\nYou're actually moving the three tabs to a new instance of Notepad++ which has its own \"window\".\nInstances operate independently e.g. session information is not shared. Saving a session only includes the tabs of one instance (the \"window\" with focus). Switching to the second instance and saving its session to the same file will overwrite the session data of the first instance. So depending on which instance (the one with 4 tabs or the one with 3 tabs open) was last used to save the session data detemines how many tabs are opened on (re-)loading the saved session.\n\nNow you have one app working in 2 windows.\n\nChrome (and FireFox) starts one instance which can open several \"windows\" with each one or more tabs.\nNotepad++ is one instance 1 window with one or more tabs.\nYou might want to change this issue into a feature request.\n\nThis is a nightmare when the power is lost unexpectedly.\n\nNo feature in Notepad++ can solve power issues, try an Uninterruptible Power Supply. \ud83d\ude04 .

Do you use a UserDefinedLanguage because Notepad++ does not support syntax coloring for Stata?. @miile7 Please try my updated PHP parser posted here.. @ShoresOfNowhere \n\nSimply put, the parser should totally ignore curly braces in quoted or double quoted strings...\n\nThe parser does ignore everything between single and double quoted strings.\nThere might be more than one functionList.xml on you system. \nUpdate the parser in the \"active\" one and check again with aforementioned code example.. I guess you missed the option to be able to search among existing issues.. You're not suppost to load binairy files with Notepad++ as it's a text editor.\nPlease close the issue.. From the Notepad++ website:\n\nNotepad++ is a free source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages.\n\nand from the Scintilla website (the core component used by Notepad++):\n\nScintilla is a free source code editing component. ... Scintilla includes features especially useful when editing and debugging source code. ...\nI mean there are many text editors, past and current, that support loading and editing binary files. Some of them even come with a Hex editor built right in\n\nThen why not use one of those?\nI use HxD for those rare occasions.\n\nin case of Notepad++ there has been at least one third party Hex editing plugin.\n\nEmphasis on third party. AFAIK unstable and no longer maintained.. @hnmcc have a look here.. The problem is caused by the parser incorrectly checking for keywords as function/method names while allowing them to start with a keyword. So it's not related to the \"f\" alone but to \"formAndControls\" starting with the keyword \"for\".\nFollow this link to the forum for an updated parser that solves this problem.. @SuperUserNameMan no it's not (see my comment at #4845).. @hnmcc \nIf you updated the parser with the one I linked to (twice) you might have updated the wrong functionList.xml i.e. there could be more functionList.xml files on your system.\n. No problem here with Notepad++ 7.5.5  (32-bit):\n\n. It will no longer be a Function List when local and global variables are included.\nTry any of the plugins that already include those i.e. TagsView, Gtag Search, NppGTags, Source Cookifier, TagLEET.. This is not a bug.\nGiven the setting for the Boost Regex engine (format_all) the backreference used in the replace string is not correct, it should be either $0 or $& (see this reference, select Boost for one of the columns on the right).. Yes there is.\nOpen your functionList.xml, search for <!-- comment out the following node to display the method with its parameters --> in the applicable parser(s), revert, save changes and restart Notepad++.. Yes there are issues, see this Community post by guy038.. Typos:\n1. DroppingFolderAsProjetModeWarning --> DroppingFolderAsProjectModeWarning in line 974\n2. FileTooBigToOpene --> FileTooBigToOpen in line 1001. Your steps to reproduce the issue are incomplete/unclear ...\n\nAttempt to view UNC resources via the Notepad++ tool\n\n\nAttempt how?\nWhich Notepad++ tool or is tool a reference to Notepad++ itself?\n\n\nUNC drives would be displayed in dropdown list\nThe dropdown list does not display any UNC mapped resources\n\nWhat dropdown list exactly?. Did you try changing the dialog style?\ni.e. see Settings > Preferences... > Default Directory > Use new style dialog (without file extension feature & Unix style path capacity). Or maybe better update to Scintilla 3.7.6 as this issue has been fixed in Scintilla 3.7.5 (bug 1929).\n. Why implement a new locking mechanism when there is already one available in .\\src\\MISC\\common\\mutex.*?. There's already a Yuni::MutexLocker class. Why not use that one?. Dispite using an autolocker/lock-guard on a mutex you can still manually (un-)lock it e.g.\n```C++\ntemplate \nclass CThreadSafeQueue : protected std::list\n{\npublic:\nvoid push(C& c)\n{\n    Yuni::MutexLocker lock(m_Mutex); //<-- auto lock (RAII)\n    push_back( c );\n    m_Mutex.unlock(); //<-- manual unlock\n\n    if (!::ReleaseSemaphore(m_hSemaphore, 1, NULL))\n    {\n        // If the semaphore is full, then take back the entry.\n        m_Mutex.lock(); //<-- manual lock\n        pop_back();\n        if (GetLastError() == ERROR_TOO_MANY_POSTS)\n        {\n            m_bOverflow = true;\n        }\n    }\n} //<-- auto unlock\n\nbool pop(C& c)\n{\n    Yuni::MutexLocker lock(m_Mutex);\n\n    // \n}\n\nprotected:\n    Yuni::Mutex m_Mutex;\n};\n```. Oooh, d#mn it you're right that won't work (as intended) \ud83d\ude01\n@donho and @milipili could you extend the Yuni::MutexLocker class with manual un-/lock?\nWould you consider a PR for libyuni?. @milipili the snippet is from PowerEditor/src/WinControls/ReadDirectoryChanges/ThreadSafeQueue.h.. Can not reproduce on Windows 10 64-bit with Notepad++ 7.5.6 32 bit or Notepad++ 7.5.6 64 bit.. If you're new to programming and/or lack the abbility to analyse basic compiler/linker message as posted above you might be better of with starting on a different/easier project.\nDuplicate/related to issue #1228, Community topics 13959 and 15457..

Your system might contain more than one functionList.xml and Notepad++ is using a different one than you\u2019d expect.. > Maybe even add an xml schema to even better check the content of the xmls.\nIMO that's the right way (e.g. see functionList.xsd).. Please try my updated PHP parser posted here.. Update the set of the current C++ unitTest file and its related result file or create additional sets.. Isn't it possible to filter out the files with .expected.result extension?. Already implemented in N++ 7.5.6 (see item 2 of change list), allthough it lacks contrast.. Then you'd benefit more from the already available export functionality as used by the FunctionList \"unit\" tests. Allthough this only works using the command line interface and it exports the FunctionList as a JSON file, so you'd still have to manipulate the contents of that file to get the required format/info.. Just fetching Scintilla as a dependency is not enough.\nThe Scintilla source provided with N++ has several changes compared to the official Scintilla source.. Some of the changes were requested upstream (i.e. Scintilla) but rejected.. SCFIND_CXX11REGEX might be benifical to improve upon the default RegEx engine of Scintilla but last time I looked it does not improve on Boost::Regex.\nIf I remember correctly there has been a discussion about Cxx11Regex (more specific replacing Boost::Regex library with PCRE2 library) on the Community forum.. @Kataderon is this the/your solution/implementation for issue(s) #98 and/or #1151?. RECT maxWin = { 0 };\n. I would like to see some comment here to explain the 'magic' numbers.\n. Again, please add comment to explain the 'magic' numbers.\n. I believe it's spelled \"shortcut\".\n. Then why decrease with 'true' instead of '1'?\n. Please do not use the lstr-functions, use the _tcs-functions instead.\n. Hmm, you're missing set.\n. language(s)\n. Shouldn't these (id 43039 to 43043) start with Recherche too?\n. According to my GitHub diff-view you added the conjugation Recherche (w/o trailing r) for id range 43033 to 43037. For id range 43039 to 43043 you added Rechercher (w/ trailing r i.e. the verb).\nYep, I know, I'm nit-picking ;-)\n. Another suggestion:\nLoad Library has failed.\\nChanging the project's \\\"Runtime Library\\\" setting to \\\"Multi-threaded(/MT)\\\" might solve this problem.\n. > any good tool to manage\nGit or TortoiseGit and probably others I don't know of.\n\ncommunication channel\n\nSee Community and Gitter badges on this page right under this header.\n. Is the SW_SHOW deliberate or should it be !hideOrShow as is in the three lines above it?\nWhen deliberate add a explanatory comment to prevent anyone to interpret as a copy/paste error.\n. So ... that's probably why the AppVeyor build fails (hint for OP).\n. You misspelled _lineCommentIncBlankLines.\nBut _lineCommentBlankLines is more consistent with the description of the parameter and Inc might be associated with increment instead of include.\n. Naming it IDC_CHECK_LINE_COMMENT_BLANK_LINES would be more consistent with the description.\n. FYI:\n1. it's possible to create code with VS2015 that also compiles with VS2013.\n2. there's a free edition of VS2013.\n. This change reverses code that complies to the Style Guide. \n. This change reverses code that complies to the Style Guide.\n. And again ... code style!\n. I think he ment using something like ...\nNSIS\n!define Version         VERSION_MAJOR \".\" VERSION_MINOR\ninstead of ...\nNSIS\n!define Version         \"7.0.0.0\"\n. The trailing comment doesn't make sense to me ...\n- which two values?\n- during compilation of what?\n. Why another way?\nPick one and don't mention other way(s) or mention the other way(s) and comment/explain why it's not the preferred way. Don't create confusion!\n. I think it's wise to get confirmation about the meaning of the different parts of the version number first i.e. before issuing a PR.\n. Would be nice if it's possible to give the variables explanatory names.\n. I get that the two $Rx variables/registers will contain values that are read from Notepad++ (i.e. ${EXEPATH}) but it's not clear what's the meaning of these values:\n- ProductVersion and FileVersion?\n- major and minor version?\n- ...\n. Correct about APPVERSION but AFAIK FileVersion and ProductVersion are always the same for Notepad++.\n. Why did you add it?\n. :+1: \n. I don't think it's a time critical part and self explanatory code is preferred (see Style Guide)\n. No still doesn't answer my question!\nI can only presume that you mean that $R0 will contain the file version i.e. 6.9.2.0 and $R1 will contain the Product name i.e. Notepad++ as that are the values in the red box.\nIf that's the case I would have written the line of code as ...\nNSIS\nGetDllVersion \"${EXEPATH}\" $R0 $R1 ; Get file version and product name respectively\n. As I wrote before pick one method/solution to be included in the official repository through a PR.\nKeep tries to your local development environment.\n. Finally the explanation I was looking for :+1:\nI suggest ...\nNSIS\nGetDllVersion \"${EXEPATH}\" $R0 $R1 ; Get 32-bit values with major+minor and release+build respectively\n. Product version and File version are the same (see Notepad++ resource file).\nBut there's a difference in notation for the VERSION_DIGITALVALUE and the VERSION_VALUE.\nThe property list of the Notepad++ v6.9.2.0 executable will show the digital value (i.e. comma-separated-digits) as dot-separated-digits (e.g. 6.9.2.0) and the textual value will be visible as defined in the resource file i.e. 6.92.\nMaybe it's possible for the NSIS script to read the version directly from the Notepad++ resource.h file?\n. What Windows version is that?\nStrange that it shows the digital/fixed value for File version and textual/variable for Product version.\nYep, I've used automatic generated resource info in projects based on the linked MS info.\nNotepad++ version numbering is not the same as MS tends to do it.\nHere are some different methods I've seen over the years:\n- Windows uses       : major.minor[.build[.revision]]\n- .NET    uses       : major.minor[.revision[.build]]\n- other used formats : major.minor[.maintenance[.build]]\n                       major.minor[.build[.((majorRevision && 0x00FF)<<8)||(minorRevision && 0x00FF)]]\n                       major.minor[.patch[.stage]]\nMore recent I've encountered projects mentioning they use Semantic Versioning.\n. These were recently removed because not longer valid.\n. What about preventing compare of 'english.xml' with itself?\n. The at-start-of-line (^) and optional leading blanks ([\\t\\x20]*) don't improve the comment detection but rather make it worse i.e. it prevents detecting trailing comment.\n. The !echo will list text messages in the FunctionList tree. \nThat might be your personal preference but is not something to include in the list of official parsers.\n. > could still have some value\nWhat value exactly?\n. > doesn't have \"grouping capabilities\"\nYes it does (somewhat) with classRange. I intend to use it for SectionGroup.\n. Typo: Scintilla\n. Typo: Scintilla\n. Shouldn't it be \"SCSS File\" or \"Sassy CSS File\" as SASS syntax is not equal to SCSS syntax?\n. Wouldn't \"udl\" make fore sense as it's short for User Defined Language?\n. You don't need the SciLexer.dll to be able to build Notepad++.\n. You moved it from the section \"To build SciLexer.dll without boost\" to the section \"To build notepad++.exe\", that doesn't make any sense. Furthermore, the complete readme.md is about building and not about executing.\n. Yes, I can understand that you'd want to extend the instructions in the section \"To build SciLexer.dll with boost\". But why not extend them as done in the next section \"To build SciLexer.dll without boost\"? Only the applicable ones, to be clear.\nFYI  you don't need to run vcvarsall.bat to be able to build Boost. You need it to be able to build Scintilla (i.e. SciLexer.dll) though.\n. This copy instruction is required for both the Scintilla build with and without Boost.\n. Replace your added (\\s+)?\\( with \\b.\n. Ditto for the (\\s+)?\\(.\n. Ditto, negative look-a-heads are superfluous.\n. Yes, the negative look-a-heads are superfluous in both funcNameExpr.\n. Ditto, superfluous negative look-a-head in both the nameExpr.\n. Ditto, superfluous negative look-a-head in both the funcNameExpr.\n. Ditto, superfluous negative look-a-head in both the nameExpr.\n. Negative look-a-head is NOT superfluous!\nIt should have been (?!(?-i:if|while|for|switch)\\b) to ...\n1. prevent (i.e. the (?! ... )) the case-sensitive keywords (i.e. the (?-i: ... )) from being used as identifiers;\n2. permit identifiers to start with a keyword by adding the word boundary (\\b).\n. Ditto, not superfluous negative look-a-head, just incorrect.\n. Might be wise to check the return value, see ExpandEnvironmentStrings help and it's example.\n. I guess this line can be removed (remainder of copy-paste).. This if-statement can be combined with the previous if-statement.. Why not skip the intermediate variable with a single statement like ::SendMessage(_hCheckEolFilled, BM_SETCHECK, (style._eolFilled ? 1 : 0), 0);?. As also/already mentioned in #2585:\n1.  I guess separate PR's would have been better.\n2.  Furthermore, why add a separate style for \"USER DEFINED\" keywords when it is already possible to enter user-defined keywords as part of the \"KEYWORDS\" style?. [$_\\w] can be reduced to [$\\w] as underscore is part of \\w.. [\\w_$] can be reduced to [\\w$] as underscore is part of \\w.. I'd expect a get...Resolution function to return the resolution i.e. both horizontal and vertical.. Is \\s interpreted as a ASCII space or as a Regular Expression white-space?\nIf it's the latter \\t is already part of \\s i.e. Regular Expression \\s matches a space, a tab, a line break, or a form feed.. You added the same code (more or less) four times to determine whether the file is a 'tex' file. Create a separate function instead e.g. bool isTexFile( ... ).\nOn the other hand it might not be necessary to create such a function as there are examples throughout the code how to determine whether special language conditions apply.

Depends on what (part of the) documentation one is reading (String and Character Literals).. > The TEXT macro might also be implemented in a way that produces a compiler-specific string literal that is only valid for strings but not for characters.\nTrue but any macro or function might be implemented differently in the future.\nThe documentation might not be up to date or incomplete. Although the same can be said about the source code of the library.\nDo a search for TEXT(' in the Microsoft header files and be supprised how often they use the TEXT macro for character literals, apparently contradicting their own documentation (e.g. sddl.h, strsafe.h).. otherwise it should have been (the project is build with both UNICODE and _UNICODE defined):\ncpp\nif (_shortcutFilter[0] == L'\\0') {\n    return true;\n}. The C++ way i.e. using constructor only instead of assignment with implicit constructor call (nit-picking?):\ncpp\nconst int NB_MAX(128);\nand i.e. always init strings:\ncpp\nTCHAR str[NB_MAX](TEXT(\"\\0\"));\nThe (ANSI-)C way of init seems to be the policy within this source file though, but at least init the string.\n. Compacted (nit-picking?):\ncpp\nbool ShortcutMapper::isFilterValid(Shortcut sc)\n{\n    if (_shortcutFilter.empty()) \n    {\n        return true;\n    }\n    // does the name match the filter (which is  stored in lower case)\n    return (stringToLower(generic_string(sc.getName())).find(_shortcutFilter) != std::string::npos);\n}\nAllthough that last line may be a bit to compact for readability.. Missing _findReplaceDlg.setStatusbarMessage(result, FSMessage);?. Why keep the original source as comment?. Likewise.. Likewise.. Likewise..

So lines 89 to 93 of NppIO.cpp can be removed as their intended use (i.e. fix problem of monitoring files which are in root) are now (correctly) solved with this patch?.

I agree that this is often not desired as well as having the last input of the search textbox replaced by that string. Sometimes you just want to close the find dialog so that it doesn't obscure any text. When you reopen it, you want to be able to go on where you left. This also changes the start position for a search from the start of the string to the end of the string. That's not so good.\nHowever, it's useful very well if you select some text and then press the shortcut to find or to replace.\n. I guess the first behavior that you describe is supposed to be this way. If a developer wants to have a blank line in indented code, he would desire exactly this. When working with lists it may be not desired. So make it an option?\nFor the second behavior that you describe I can confirm that this can be annoying.\n. > @tvb377:\n\nWould an option to disable this behaviour be desirable / could it be agreed upon?\n\nIf others dislike this, there could be an option for it, although I wouldn't need it:\n\nAfter hitting Enter at the end of an indented line, the next line is, of course, automatically indented to the same level as the previous one.

You make it appear by hitting Ctrl+Alt+I. There are additional suggestions for this feature in issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/811.\n\n@DavidBailey100:\n\nI wish this dialog would have explicit search up and search down buttons. Sure you can set the direction to 'up', but then that remains set and thus easily messes up subsequent searches.\n\nNot a bad idea!

So it looks consistent with no additional configuration.\n\nI agree; a monospace font is what's suggested in the first two comments and in issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/563, too, although I would make it smaller than the editor font.\n. I only meant there should be an option to let it appear different than the editor font. I would use that option.\nWhat do you say about the illustration of the buttons?\n. # Description of features\n- It's all about the find-and-replace dialog. The find string, the replace string and the options of how to perform the search or replacement can be saved as a named entity temporarily or permanently.\n  - Temporarily: For this and other features the name or label textbox should be in the near of the find-string textbox so that it's easy to let the dialog memorize valuable data and states with a name. It gets saved as soon as you hit a find, mark or replace button. Over time it moves out of the range of saved entities and gets lost (speaking of the menu later discussed). If an action is performed again with the same name, the item is put to the top of the list again and is updated. A name is useful to not being forced to inspect a regular expression again. However, you don't have to provide a name. If you don't, a user-adjusted entity is saved as an additional one on the top of the list of temporary entities.\n  - Permanently saved entities can be useful, e.g., for a chain of regular expressions that you developed and that you have to apply again later.\n- While giving the name you should be able to type | (vertical bar) to create a submenu item. This allows to group the entities. There should be no low limit for the depth of subgroups.\n- Icon buttons to save (if necessary create) and delete an entity should be near the name textbox.\n- There should be a simple, small button (e.g. with a right-pointing arrow head) that shows the top menu of the entities. Temporary entities (even named) should display their find string and replace string (see GUI design). Displaying these strings even for named entities is because a name for a temporary entity would not be as well-chosen as for a permanent entity. Clicking an entity fills the dialog with the data of this entity.\n- Icon buttons to move and to delete an entity should be on the right of a menu item. The menu should not disappear when using these buttons. (I hope that is possible with the GUI toolkit Notepad++ uses. Otherwise please tell the alternatives.)\n- The entities\u2014but also all other states and data of the dialog\u2014should be saved as they are changed in a crash-safe way (including backing up before changing?) because it can contain valuable data not easy to reconstruct.\n- There should be no low size limit for the saved contents of the multiline textboxes. See issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/778#user-content-insertion-of-list-elements to see an example of a regular expression that can have many many lines.\n- See the GUI design below for some more details.\n. # GUI design\nI think it will help and accelerate development to show this textual GUI design.

I don't like the proposed feature as default functionality. :-1: Maybe, you both only have scenarios in mind where you always type words in the text boxes. There are many other scenarios with more complex expressions and replacement strings.\n. I think this will clutter the dialog with elements that are less import in my opinion than the ones of issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/452#issuecomment-128483383. However, I don't think this is nonsense. What about this button at the bottom that lets a menu appear that contains the actions and options spoken of?\n+--------+\n| More > |\n+--------+\nIt seems appropriate because they are a kind of meta-actions/meta-options.\nI guess users would easily find out themselves that the actions and options apply to all tabs, for it's the same with the current options. So, stating this would be cluttering, too, in my opinion.\n. > https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/543 Good for kids.\nThat's right ironically! More people should vote down.\n. :-1: to criticized content.\n. Reference: issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/729\n. @donho: Just out of curiosity: Isn't the ever-growing number of issues becoming an issue?\n. @donho: The number of issues was first 100, then 200, 300, 400, and now nearly 500, whereas the progress of closed issue was much slower. I was wondering whether at some point in the future there are so many topics of issues that users wanting to report issues just need to comment on existing ones, or if the number of issues won't stop growing.\n. @donho: Fine! :+1:\n. Reference: issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/729\n. It's not a good image for these parts of Windows, and its annoying. I strongly disagree in saying the existing font size option of Windows is not so important! It's something to pay attention to as a UI.\n. It has to be said that for some it makes a UI much more usable in the long run. You just prefer 200 % scaling to 240 % or similar. But reading is another thing than recognizing common UI elements like the X in the caption bar of a window. If it wouldn't be that important ClearType would not have been invented, e.g., which is appreciated by many.\n. If there are others also wanting to see the information in the find-and-replace dialog, I would leave this option as something to seriously consider. Otherwise it would be okay for me to have it in the about dialog.\n. I don't see why all text should be selected. I had similar issues with Notepad++ selecting all text when searching for a regular expression that was not supposed to select all text.\n. I wish that the plug-in functionality is either available out of the box with proper integration or that the plug-in ships with Notepad++ and gets an integration with context menu and such that doesn't make it distinguishable from program functionality.\nCan a plug-in be as trouble-free as program functionality in the future?\n. Have you read this: \"Reorder of escape sequences to make it more clear that there's no word ellipsis, but a character ellipsis. Order of line break characters is natural order of Windows line breaks. Seldomly used \\0 at the end.\"\nI always thought there must be some more escape sequences not mentioned. Or do you mean some additional information?\n. @dail8859:\n\n+1 I like in alot of programs how the mouse can be directly against the right of the screen and still use the scrollbar.\n\n:+1:\n. Also the caption bars of dockable dialogs and their UI elements are not scaled up.\n. > @nsgundy:\n\nTab labels are really tiny (200% scaling set in windows):\n\nI can agree the font is too small when having the system setting increased, but here, it's not that small! That's very strange! Here, it's just as small as, for instance, the text in the find-and-replace dialog.\n. Try it with this setting (Windows 10, translated from German, find your way): \"Settings\" > \"System\" > \"Extended Display Settings\" > \"Extended Size Settings for Text and Other Elements\". Then change the size for every list item. Check if the items remain changed after applying. This changes just the text, although the taskbar text doesn't want to change.\n. > The text cursor is also too thin. It's a single device pixel whereas (at 200%) it should be 2 device pixels like in every other application. I can barely see it between the text. Should I open a new issue for this?\nMine is wider than 1 device pixel. I think there's an option for this in Notepad++.\n. > @JoelRSimpson:\n\nI have a 4k laptop display and 4 external monitors.\n\nThen you can go take a walk with your mouse cursor.\n. It might have to do with different DPI scaling factors on different monitors.\n. @M-Jup:\nMight have to do with per-monitor DPI-awareness not being present.. Reference: issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/729\n. Thanks for the information. It's strange to have menu icons as a plug-in. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with the German translation. I think, it should be implemented as program functionality. But you have provided colored icons that could be used for that.\n. Yeah, I got most menu item icons to work for the German translation. Unfortunately, they are too small on a high-dpi monitor whereas the toolbar icons are scaled properly. If you could get in contact with Franco according to this bug, I would appreciate that. His e-mail address isn't complete and an extrapolated one doesn't work. It would be a great help to at least have an option to double the icon size before setting them on the menu items. Pixelating (nearest neighbor) is okay.\nStill, this remains a feature request to add menu icons for all languages out of the box.\n. Franco Stellari gave me some information for increasing the icon size: One has to make a change in the file: ?:\\Users\\???\\AppData\\Roaming\\Notepad++\\plugins\\config\\MenuIcons.ini. Set IconSize to 48 or 32. Let me add: 'Cause the file may be reset, make it write-protected, at least until the value is \"established\".\nFor anyone who wants to have the German icon set: Download here (\"Save as...\") and rename it to MenuIcons set, English by Yaron 2015-08-05, renamed to German by h-h-h-h v1.1.zip. Some files remained English because of MenuIcons not providing a full menu items list, i.e., the corresponing menu items don't get their icon.\nFor your information: I couldn't create a multilingual set because Notepad++ has a greater number of menu items not having an ID.\n. @Yaron10: I can't work with these XML files for this purpose. I use MenuIcons' option \"Generate list...\". See my edit.\n@Rikk: Yeah, it's a great workaround! :+1:\n. Here are more 16x16px icons: http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/. Should someone find vector icons, that would be even better.\n. What type of mockup? A screenshot containing menu icons?\n. @milipili:\n\nCould you propose a mockup with all those icons ?\n\nThere should definitely be the possibility to let the icons be as big as you want. To be helpful, the icons have to be this big here (48 x 48 px):\n\n. @Rikk:\n\nDrag-drop often fails when one of the two programs is running with elevated privileges (ie. as admin) and the other normal privs.\n\n@1Nick1Name:\n\nit's working now and the problem seems to be related to installaing or running in admin mode\n\nThere seems to be a possibility to make it work. Please google for ChangeWindowMessageFilter admin drag drop. If this really works, it should be incorporated. What do you think about it?\n. Reference: issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/729\n. Reference: issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/729\n. Maybe the font setting and the font files were preserved during the update. Try to download the font Source Code Pro from its original download source in its latest version.\n. https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/tag/2.010R-ro/1.030R-it\nYou have to figure out the rest yourself.\n. By \"Source code\" they mean the font name. Call it misspelled. The download contains TTF files! Other font files of this may be still in the Notepad++ directory. I would delete them to not supersede the downloaded ones. If you can't help yourself, google: install a font windows.\n. Fine!\n. For your convenience and to get the bug resolved more quickly here's a quick way to generate the test file: Paste these lines with line break thereafter 5 x 5 times. That is, paste it 5 times, copy the result, paste it 5 times and so on until you get 150,000

Great!\n. There's information in this issue that is still relevant. This issue is an addition. Surely, not every detail was planned as I described it. It wasn't said _where_ it is planned. Not in an issue? Then we would see a reference here. I expect something like that.\n. You can look forward to and up-vote for issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/563 if that's allowed. :blush:\n. I'm not able to follow.\n- \"for that, I get the list of all items\"?\n- And are you trying to replace the zero-width match of^with nothing?\n- \"this multi line tags\"?\n. Are you sure you have used the native find-and-replace dialog? You can't enter linebeaks there! Maybe you used a plug-in capable of typing in text with multiple lines. See the plug-in manager.\n. :+1:\n. @dail8859: It's the same as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>. I already discovered that. I want the comment initiation string at _the very start_ of the lines, i.e. at column 1. I also expect the option not to be \"intelligent\"; it should just add one layer of comment initiation strings, e.g.//or#`, and remove one layer of it on every line that starts with one.\n@Croydon: As I already guessed, the issue is becoming a feature request.\n. :+1:\nAs in other software (Firefox) there should be a top border, but no side borders. A bottom border wouldn't be bad.\n. @aaaxx:\n\nWhat's the purpose of adjustable border anyway (or any kind of border for that matter)?\n\n:point_up_2:\n. The dialog is already there. You can open it, e.g., with Ctrl+G. But the functionality has to be added that the textbox contains the current line number in the selected state.\n. @donho:\n\nTo implement this feature properly, you should register the last search number in the current buffer, and get the number from the current buffer each time the field in question needs to be updated. That will make the code more complex for a small feature, therefore I won't implement it, and won't accept the PR for such feature.\n\nI also find the feature potentially useful. But if @donho is not willing to accept it, what can we do about it?\nMay I suggest to implement a way for additional data fields of a buffer in general, so that this internal feature could be used for future issues, too, that need to remember a value per buffer?\n. As a reference, please take a look of the bottom of this page: http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/Large_Text_Files.\n. With this shortcuts you go past the end of the line, but you're also selecting. Then you overwrite the selection of no data as if you were beginning to type at the end of the line.\nBecause selection works with just Shift+Left/Right after you used Alt+Left mouse click, these shortcut are rather pointless for this purpose. You can use them to block-select text.\n. Here's a test file (use \"Save as...\"). It has only 3 bytes (a\\0b as spoken of before).\n. I didn't know this, but the spaces to the right will remain, then. Additionally, the request is about an intuitive way to get the expected results without thinking much about the structure of the document.\n. @johnnytemp:\nAs I understand you,\nabc def          \u00b6\nabc def\u00b6\nis the only relevant thing for you, but you don't care if a case with one space is handled differently:\nabc \u00b6\n\u00b6\nI think this one-space-thing deserves attention because this is a kind of default number of spaces.\n. I realized there is a feature like this, but it is not visible due to Windows DPI scaling:\n\nHowever, there are inconsistencies and other issues:\n- \"length\" has no unit, as per my understanding it should be \"B\" or \"byte(s)\"\n- \"length\", \"lines\" don't have a capital letter\n- \"Ln\", \"Col\", \"Sel\" have a capital letter, but as per some sources a dot is appropriate at the end of an abbreviation, especially when removing characters at the end\n- Why is there a space before the colon? Is this derived from French? It's not typical for English\n- Ideally, every piece of information would be aligned independently to not be shifted around by other pieces of information\n- I think one of the texts above or a similar one suits better for the information about the selection. The length of the selection could be incorporated like this: Sel.: 5 ln., 80 col. (length: 350 ch.) (ch. = characters). This should work in column mode, too. In column mode, \"length\" could add up the lengths of the selection of the lines if regarded as useful by others.\n. Thanks for the picture.\n- The picture shows a window padding that should be accomplished. \u2713\n- The picture shows the \"Transparency\" checkbox corrected in its position. \u2713\n- The picture doesn't show what I originally meant. So to illustrate it, not:\n+----+\n|Find|\n+----+\nBut:\n+----------------+\n|                |\n|      Find      | \u2713\n|                |\n+----------------+\n\nPlease compare the paddings (200 % DPI scaling):\n\nThe tab captions look much denser although it's only a few pixels, but they sum up.\n. Thanks for the help. That's a great improvement!\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nHowever, as you can see, there are still issues. Some of them come from the the change that just happened.\n. I didn't know Notepad++ was GUI-wise done the complicated way. Wasn't there some discussion to use a proper GUI toolkit?\n. Anyhow, I don't understand how one main developer can work on so many different issues at \"the same time\" or mixing work on different issues frequently.\n. @Rikk:\n\n@h-h-h-h please tell us if the new Go To dialog in the build I provided is working or not.\n\nThe \"Go To...\" dialog is working fine with all the improvements! It just shouldn't say, \"window on top\", but \"active\" (in my understanding \"focused\" is wrong, too).\n. @Rikk: The remaining paddings of the find-and-replace dialog are corrected. It looks very good.\n. \"length\" should be kept.\n\nRelated issue: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/737\n. It would be possible to remove the corner. But this feature would require the dialog again to be resizable: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/563. So it's not a problem to make it resizable while the other feature is not implemented.\n. Because issue #563 contains a greater number of sub-issues, I meant it wouldn't hurt to make the dialog resizable separately. Let us see how the developer decides.\n. :+1:\nRelated issue: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/737\n. > I'd suggest ignoring a single line break at the _very end _of the selection. When I select entire lines all from the first column (where I keep my cursor most of the time when dealing with entire lines), I'd like to know the number of lines I've selected, not the number of lines that selection and cursor somehow touch.\nThis sounds reasonable.\n. See issues https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/547, https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/729 and similar ones.\n. If it's not working properly, it should be remarked in the appropriate issue.\n. Isn't this a matter of some kind of automatic reformatting?\nHow would you describe a new general feature that could be applied to CSV/TSV? I can only think of doing it like office programs that stretch tabs to a specified position. But these positions would need to be automatically determined and updated as the data changes. This, in turn, has to be vindicated by some general rule that recognizes whether and how a file should be monitored.\n. It should be an additional bar. Sublime Text has this feature, too.\nI think you should be able to switch between the dialog and the bar. A taller bar would be able to replace, too. When you press Ctrl+F and the like, Notepad++ should show what was last shown (dialog or bar). When using the bar, some navigation should still be possible as in Firefox in spite of the search textbox having focus.\n. :+1:\nI think, it's a nice feature to be able to delete a file from within Notepad++. Of course, an option for this would have to be in the settings rather than a question in the installation process or something else. However, I don't see why it should be an option when a notable message box for confirmation is shown.\nI think Notepad++ should follow the Windows default in using the recycle bin or not. This means only one option in the context menu/File menu.\n. There are the same or few problems with different fonts defining the characters. For instance, I could not reproduce the problems with Arial Unicode MS. The font Source Code Pro doesn't define the N character told of, but also has the problem with a line break in the line of arrows. With the text \u21d0\u21d1\u21d2\u21d3\u21d4\u21d5\u21d6\u21d7\u21d8\u21d9 the problem occurs starting from the 6th character (half of the line) when inserting a line break.\n. - Arial Unicode MS doesn't rotate \u2115 here (the character is defined by the font)\n- Courier New doesn't define any of the mentioned characters here, although Notepad++ displays the arrows when being on one line. There's also the problem of not displaying the first two characters of the arrows when putting a line break after them. \u2115 is not displayed in general.\nSo it is related to taking glyphs from another font (reference article). Windows' Notepad does this, too.\n. How long is that document new? Because Notepad++ can restart keeping unsaved buffers, one might let \"new\" documents reside for some time! In my opinion, \"new\" is not appropriate.\n. PCRE2 makes a feature available to replace according to a list with only one regular expression. This is done via the pcre2_substitute() or the pcre2_get_mark() function.\nExample:\n\nTarget:       apple lemon\nFind:         apple(*:pear)|lemon(*:orange)\nReplace with: ${*MARK}\nResult:       pear orange\n\nView the latest version of the following file to see the documentation about this: http://vcs.pcre.org/pcre2/code/trunk/doc/pcre2.txt (rev. 369). Search for:\n- ${*MARK}\n- PCRE2_ALT_VERBNAMES\nIs it possible to make this functionality available in Notepad++? Note: To allow any replacement string in (*:...), PCRE2_ALT_VERBNAMES has to be set. It allows escaping (e.g., \\)), free spacing ((?x)) and comments (#).\n\nPCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_EXTENDED should also be set to allow for conditional substitutions when pcre2_substitute() is used. The syntax in the replacement string is: ${name:+set string:unset string}. See the corresponding feature request for additional information.\n. :+1:\nIt would be a first solution. Of course, a listbox wide enough that in turn would let the scrollbars disappear would be the best.\n. @Ach3r0n:\n\nI oppose against adding a scrollbar to the listbox, but I support making the listbox wider.\n\nWhat if some string in some language will be too long again? A scrollbar appearing only then is appropriate. Someone can address the issue of a scrollbar appearing at a later time, but at least the full strings would be usable in the mean time.\n. I can't reproduce it in v6.8.2.\n. - Might it be related to a plug-in? Disabling the plug-ins could clear up the matter.\n- I tested it with a simple ASP file, but could not reproduce the bug\n- Does the bug show up in every environment for you? New document, text file, only \"a\"s in one row ...\n. Fine that the issue is resolved.\nBut I have no access to do these things. I don't even know where this plug-in resides.\nI guess, if we leave the issue open, someone will help bring this plug-in issue on its way.\n. So you just have to know that? Then the issue could be closed.\n. > \"Find in Files\" window itself displays the 'resize' widget, but resize do not work\nSee also issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/774.\n\n\"Directory\" option can be filled by clicking on the 'three dots' button, that opens a \"browse for folder\" window whose size is fixed. (maybe it's related to windows itself unfortunately)\n\nIt's good to let such a window be resizable. Further, there should be a textbox to paste a directory path as in other software, even though you can paste the final directory in the find-and-replace dialog directly. This is because you might want to start to browse from the pasted directory for another directory.\n. I don't see any obstacles for this regarding the GUI design.\n\"Go To...\" dialog:\n( ) Line     ( ) Offset     (*) Column\nThe question is: Is that enough or would one want the ability to specify line and column at once?\n. Because it reads \"Document Map\", I changed it to \"Find Results - 100 Hits\".\nWhat about a proper em dash? Today's default fonts like Segoe UI are no barrier to this.\nExample: \"Find Results\u2014100 Hits\".\n Probably \"DockingCont.cpp\" \n. A newspaper headline of this format is imaginable. I'll leave the pull request as-is to see the opinion of the one accepting or declining it.\n. :+1:\n. > @Keavon:\n\nCtrl Y is the past... Ctrl Shift Z is the present.\n\nThat's a little bit too much of it. Ctrl+X/Y are still my favorites.\n. > @BobStein:\n\nyou mean Ctrl+Z/Y don't you?\n\nYes.\n. Please merge your issue into issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/571 and close this one.\n. Related issue: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/813.\nMaking code sequences of the characters with `...` might resolve the issue of Github making images out of them.\n. I can't reproduce the bug (Notepad++ 6.8.3, Windows 8.1).\n. Now I see. I can reproduce this bug.\nAlso, look how funny the dialog looks with 200 % scaling:\n\n. @dg9ngf:\n\nMost applications give you a little more room to type and let you scroll so far that the last line of the document is displayed at the top of the window.\n\nMost? I only know a few, and mostly I find it strange. But I see that it can make sense in a few scenarios. So an option to enable this would be okay to me.\n\nroom to type\n\nDo you mean something like going past the end of the line (column mode) without changing the view of the scrollbar? (E.g. with Alt+Arrow key, see issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/724 .) If not--not seeing the exact end of the file using the normal text navigation and the line numbers is negative from my point of view.\n\nlet you scroll so far that the last line of the document is displayed at the top of the window.\n\nThis extent is what I find strange. Some programs allow to show the end of the document at the vertical center of the textbox. How about that?\n. I think the behavior should be:\n- The scrollbar shows the real plus the artificial document range.\n- You have the option to set the number of lines to add for scrolling (alternatively the percentage of the viewport height to add, rounded to number of lines). This is to not be annoyed by a too far scrolling; mostly you still want to see your document when scrolling to the virtual end (see also below).\n- A slightly different background color where no document is, or, alternatively, a horizontal line (like column indicator) would be desirable.\n- When pressing Ctrl+End, you get to the end of the document just as it is now. When you press it again, the scrolling shows all additional lines (like End, End on wrapped lines). The cursor position in the text stays the same.\n- When you type to the bottom of the textbox and press Enter, all additional lines are shown.\n- If scrolling with the above two points would result in the second to last line being scrolled out of view, the scrolling is adjusted to show the second to last line on top and the last line with the cursor below it.\n. > Ctrl+End goes to the end of the document, not the end of the line.\nThat was a mistake. I corrected it.\n\nI wouldn't change that hotkey in any way.\n\nDeriving the described behavior from pressing End twice on a wrapped line is a great solution in my opinion.\n\nNo scroll jumps when typing, please. You're adding too much unexpected logic that might not even be requested by anyone.\n\nDon't you want room to type again after you used all room to type previously available? Otherwise we would have the same behavior as now, again\u2014once you reached the bottom you constantly stay there, letting scroll jumps of a height of one line happen.\n. > When the editor starts being smart and jump me around, I might lose orientation because I may not want to go so far as to see nothing above the current line anymore. So just don't implement that thinking for me, it saves you the work.\nThe described jumping behavior is only addressing edge cases (e.g., when having a small window height). Imagine having Notepad++ maximized, 40 lines visible and the option of additional scrolling lines set to 10. You type to the bottom of the textbox, hit Enter, and get a room of 10 lines again, still seeing 30 lines of the ones previously typed. You could still turn that option off (or not on).\nDo you see that a percentage option might be better than a fixed number of additional scrolling lines? I'm unsure about that.\n\nWhen scrolled down to what is possible without the plugin now, the scrollbar is at the bottom end. When scrolling further, it should just not change anymore.\n\nBut then you loose the ability to scroll this far by means of dragging the scrollbar rectangle. This way your only options to scroll this far would be to use Ctrl+Up/Down or the down button of the scrollbar. This is inconsistent behavior for me and not desirable when I imagine to have an additional number of lines of, say, 5.\n. > As I said, I wouldn't want to set the additional space to anything other than 100% of the viewport height. Or to be very precise, I want the last line of the document to be in the first visible line. Not above or below that (we don't have pixel scrolling, so it's easy to define that). Smaller values just feel arbitrary and unnatural to me.\nA percentage option\u2014How much of the textbox height should be added for additional scrolling?\u2014would make both of us happy. You would set it so 100 %, I would set it to 10 %. Smaller values are relevant for pressing Ctrl+End twice and the like.\n\nYou just don't get a sense of the length of the document when the scrollbar doesn't indicate it correctly.\n\nThat's a reasonable point. I was just referring to software that implements it the way I described it.\n\ndid you consider to limit that configured number to the actual height of the viewport? I really don't want to lose the end of the document way outside the viewport in small windows...\n\nSure, I addressed it with these words:\n\n@h-h-h-h:\nIf scrolling with the above two points would result in the second to last line being scrolled out of view, the scrolling is adjusted to show the second to last line on top and the last line with the cursor below it.\n\nThis way, the last two lines of a document would never be scrolled out of view. If one just pressed Enter and has a blank line as the last one, one would want to see the last words, right?\n. > I'd not consider the contents of a line. If the last line is empty, that could still be scrolled to the top.\nOkay. Let's see what others say.\n\nJust out of curiosity, are you an active developer of NPP or more of the \"community manager\" type?\n\nI'm just a user with a number of suggestions, hoping they will be accepted. If there are other suggestions I like, I review them. If you are willing to review my most important issues, here are some links: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/452, https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/563, https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/778, https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/776, https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/572, https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/449#issuecomment-135799762.\n. I can reproduce this bug (Notepad++ 6.8.3, Windows 8.1).\n. :+1:\n. > Hyperlinks ... always have ... a hand mouse cursor when hovered\nI agree it should only be the normal text cursor by default, for you can normally select text while having a hand cursor.\n\nHyperlinks are permanently formatted with underlining ... probably, it should also only be formatted differently when hovered while the Ctrl key is pressed\n\nIt's very positive for me to have links formatted the whole time (underlined). The additional formatting should only be applied when being able to open the link, that is, with Ctrl+Click.\n\nAdditionally, there could be a tooltip when hovering a link that says: \"Open with Ctrl+Click\".\nBeing able to open a link with the keyboard is also desirable. Ctrl+Enter already has a meaning. What's a better choice? Ctrl+Space?\n. > It's still not possible (or I haven't found out how) to make all hyperlinks blue without hovering them.\nThat's a reasonable formatting while not hovering a link, too.\n. Do you have discovered the options in the settings dialog, third category? Try \"UTF-8 without BOM\" together with checking the indented checkbox.\n. > I'd like to retain autocomplete's auto-reveal, but perhaps it would be better to require me to press 'tab' to move focus into the listbox.\n\nCurrently any time autocomplete reveals, arrow keys are intercepted, preventing me from moving the cursor without pressing 'escape'\n\nThis is normal for an IDE. Thus it's no wonder for such an IDE-like feature. But because Notepad++ is not so clever as IntelliSense and the like, maybe the arrow keys could be reserved for navigation while Ctrl+Up/Down is intercepted to navigate in the list.\n. I am against the removal of spaces before ellipses. It is common for German software translations to have a space before ellipses (e.g., in menu items or buttons). As a reference, you can take a look at GIMP's German menu items, e.g.\nAlso, please note that it is recommended to not add ellipses whenever another window is displayed. See this Stack Overflow answer (first yellow box).\n. > @dg9ngf:\n\nthere's no explanation or reference for that given nor is the use of a space explicitly mentioned here, so it's unverifyable and might be a mistake.\n\nI think Wikipedia would not be the reference, anyhow\u2014it would be just one reference. But you're right\u2014webpages discussing this topic are extremely hard to find. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any (either positive or negative).\n\nI did not find any application on my computer with a German UI that uses a space in that place, except Notepad++. Now you say all of them are wrong? Prove it.\n\nIn English, the use of a space before an ellipsis is handled differently (reference). In German, no space means omitting characters, and a space means omitting words. Omitting a dialog should be represented as omitting a word.\nIn my opinion not using a space before ellipses is a somehow naive transfer of what is common in English. It's a pity for me that even Windows programs as Notepad don't use a space before ellipses in menu items. However, there's a number of software (as open-source software) that adheres to using a space before ellipses:\n- Audacity (a few inconsistent items remained)\n- GIMP\n- VLC media player\nIn XnViewMP one menu item reads: TWAIN-Quelle w\u00e4hlen (Scanner, Kamera, ...)... When you compare this with a Wikipedia article, you see that people mostly don't adhere to a thought-out concept: Er beherrscht alle lateinamerikanischen T\u00e4nze: Tango, Salsa, Rumba \u2026 Pay attention to the comma and to the style of writing ...)...\n\n\n@xylographe:\nWhile you're at it, add a translation for Count: X matches. in the Find dialogue, please.\n\nWhat's also missing is a translation for:\n- Failed matches\n- Beginning to match from the top again\n- Replacement information (in either case\u2014one or all)\n. The Wikipedia article acknowledges that an ellipsis doesn't necessarily indicate an omission (see also the following captions). Yet, an ellipsis without a space is not used in these cases. It may be viewed as a kind of word omission, maybe a content omission, in these cases.\n\n@dg9ngf:\nLarge commercial software makers employ specially trained experts for these things.\n\nThe MSDN documentation pages seem to be automatically (or sometimes semi-automatically) translated. So it is questionable that they definitely payed attention to this detail for the German language.\nAlso, \u00a0-\u00a0 is still used regularly, although a proper en dash (\u00a0\u2013\u00a0) would not be a problem with fonts like Segoe UI and windows being Unicode-enabled (reference: Notepad; see also this Wikipedia article). I think there's no good reason for Windows to ignore these typographical rules. (See also this interesting article.)\n\nMicrosoft and Adobe do have some weight in this matter.\n\nPrograms as VLC media player are renowned software that could similarly be taken as a reference.\n\nDoes anybody know how ellipses at the end of sentences (not as omission) are correctly written in English?\n\nIt seems spaces around ellipses are recommended, but not the only common way.\n. > @dg9ngf:\n\nAny more arguments?\n\nSure! I'm still against it, and I would like to see some more votes. I THINK @JANSCHREIBER TRANSLATED MANY ITEMS. Let's see whether he hears that.\n\nthe menu command isn't an enumeration either.\n\nThe Wikipedia article talks about many applications for an ellipsis, and the cases with surrounding spaces are the vast majority. All these cases have to do with a more generic point of view towards omitting characters. So, for me it's clear which category (spaces or not) menu items with an ellipsis belong to. In a sense, these two examples are applicable in my opinion:\n- Stefan begann zu stottern: \u201eIch \u2013 ich wei\u00df nicht \u2026\u201c\n- Das ist der Stoff, aus dem die Tr\u00e4ume sind \u2026\n\nBut it is a problem with the commonly used keyboard layout. Do you always want to press Alt+0150 when you have a hyphen at hand? Blame it for keyboard layouts. The same applies to quotation marks or even the ellipsis.\n\nI'm talking about the development. In Notepad, e.g., the title should be hardcoded like this: %s \u2013 Editor, as in: Interpret \u2013 Liedtitel. It's not a big deal to go through the strings of an application and replace some simple substitution characters (as \"\" instead of ) with the typographically correct ones (as ). If you're concerned about inconsistency of UI and user-typed data: I think, the UI shouldn't reflect the simplicity of user-typed data with substitution characters. The user understands that he/she typed that data and is responsible for that. Some application might even automatically replace the characters, as Word does it with quotation marks.\n. > @Krzysiu:\n\nif you'd ommit it [the space] then it will be [a] reason for another translators to ignore space[s] in their translations. You can end this loop by using correct German, not one of [a] translator who was inspired by translators who got used to bad translations.\n&vellip\nEven app[s] like N++ can change [the] language awareness of people and it could learn [teach] people what's the correct version.\n\nThanks for your statement! I read it as an encouragement for decoupling a little bit from the praxis in Windows programs, and somehow as a pro-vote for spaces before ellipses.\n\nMaybe, we'll get more German users. Please drop in, @odysseuscm, @thomasatwork, @AlBundy33.\n. > @odysseuscm:\n\nI guess the common use to not have that space has the simple (optical) reason that it's rather difficult to type a non-breaking-space and you don't want to take the chance that the ellipsis moves to the next line but rather have it \"sticking\" to the last word.\n\nThanks for dropping in! Did you understand that the pull request is just about menu items? Notepad++ doesn't have menu items with line breaks.\n. > @dg9ngf:\n\nTo do things right, the three dots would need to be replaced by the ellipsis character as well.\n\nYes, it's done in Audacity, too.\n\nHow about the dash between file name and application title? But be aware that where \" \u2013 \" (en dash) is common in German, last time I checked at least US English seems to prefer \"\u2014\" (em dash, no spaces).\n\nFor links to arguments and style recommendations see: https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop/pull/707. This window title parts separator should be translatable. Would you even comment on this issue because there's opposition?\n\nLet's see where we can improve typography in the UI elsewhere.\n\nSee pull request https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/845#issuecomment-137253651.\n\nI'm thinking at the settings dialog that feels quite messy. It's even hard to translate that because there's so little space in it and it just won't extend for the content.\n\nThat's very bad!\n. > @Krzysiu:\n\nI'm afraid I'm just taking your time\n\nTo be honest, I didn't understand anything of your last post. Moreover, you write texts that are too long for my taste.   :frowning:\n. > The vertical edge line seems to be rendered on top of everything else.\nFortunately not on top of the characters. You can test it with the character U+2588: \u2588\u2588.\n\nThe vertical line should not be invisible when having a selection. For me it's okay as it is now. Do you advocate mixing the colors?\n. You're right, CR and LF are painted below the line, but SUB, in turn, is painted above (press Ctrl+Shift+Z). That's strange.\n. :+1: \n. You have a \"Clear all marks\" button on the find-and-replace dialog. That clears this type of mark.\n. > @cmeriaux:\n\nIt's a pleasure to help you.\n\nDid you forget the <irony> tags?\n. I agree Notepad++ should keep the find-and-replace dialog's position among sessions.\n\n\n@xylographe:\nI restart NPP only once a month on average\n@dg9ngf:\nNormally I'd keep it open until the next patchday as well.\n\nAnd in between you constantly put Windows in hibernation, or not even that?\n. What a luck that Notepad++ is green:\n\nNotepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.\n(https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)\n. :+1: You could edit the following file and create a pull request if you like: \"Notepad_plus.rc\". There you could ask for clarifying the unsure points. This way, the chances are better to get it resolved more quickly.\n. :+1:\n\nWhen you proceed with clicking on \"Count\", the dialog ends up alternating the default button state between \"Find Next\" and \"Count\". But when \"Count\" is the only default button and you press Enter, the \"Find Next\" action is performed.\n. I can reproduce this bug (v6.8.3).\nRelated issues: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/850, https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/529, https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/853.\n. I can reproduce this bug (v6.8.3). It looks like a kind of flicker.\n. I can reproduce this bug (v6.8.3).\n. You seem to refer to column mode (see Edit menu). Therefore, I don't know why you are talking about multiple selection. Here, Notepad++ pastes the copied block correctly.\n. I can't reproduce this bug with a text file with NFO extension when opening the file with the context menu option \"Edit with Notepad++\".\nI think your report lacks much information and can't be expected to be reproduced.\n. As in other software, these shortcuts should be used for a similar purpose as Ctrl+Up/Down, but without changing cursor position.\nTry editing the plug-in settings or write to the author of the plug-in.\n. The shortcuts mentioned in the first comment should behave similar to the ones mentioned in the second comment, i.e., they should be used for scrolling. This means, you can't claim them to be held free for the use by a plug-in. Either the plug-in knows how to redefine existing shortcuts, or you're out of luck. This is why I told to talk to the author of the plug-in.\n. Moving the items with Left/Right isn't bad either.\n. @jhonatan4878: You can request it for Scintilla here.\n.

Reference: issue https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/729\n. Please take a look at the links in the issue of the other repository. I don't think they are all British, yet they all recommend spaces around the dash for a window title in contrast to a paragraph of text.\nAs for the question about the dash width, I think American English can be thought of as more significant, at first. But as I pointed out, the separator string should be localizable (see issue of other repository for more information).\n. It was already accepted: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/574. This is just for the remaining languages.\n. See also there. (Are you subscribed to commit discussion?)\n. Important quote from linked article (obviously partly only applicable to past Windows versions):\n\nSome applications would register themselves as being Per-Monitor-DPI Aware not because they actually were DPI aware, but because they didn\u2019t want Windows to bitmap stretch them.\nThese problems resulted in very few applications handling dynamic display scaling correctly. Many applications that registered themselves as being Per-Monitor-DPI Aware don\u2019t scale at all and can render extremely large or extremely small on secondary displays.. > Perhaps a clue would be in the \"Debug Information\" you didn't supply.\n\nI'm sorry. I didn't know what that meant. Just found it in the ? menu and edited the previous comment.\n\nThere is different behavior as I just experienced:\n\nWhen I drop the text into the Firefox search bar (that's just for searching, not an omnibar!), the text in Notepad++ is deleted.\nWhen I drop the text into the GitHub comment <textarea> where I typed this text you're reading just now, the text in Notepad++ is not deleted.. \n",

This command is already there (in help menu).\n. If we wanted do it in a (very) consist way, we would give users the option to : \n1. split according windows size \n2. split according the edge sze\n3. Customized size.\nBut IMO, it's a reasonable behaviour for a lazy developer (like me :) ) and it won't bring any confusion to user.\n. I prefer to use an external analyzer than modify project's settings.\n. Thank you for the update... but what is the reason of this update?\n. Notepad++ use a small part of functionalities of SQLite. While there is no bug on this part so far, I don't see any reason to take the risk having regression to update whole SQLite.\n. This regression bug has been fixed and committed.\n. it's done for xml, php, html and bash : https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/9b91480ecfc5eb392d562ddab1d530bd439d386e\n. @ariccio We don't build Scilexer.dll automatically because Scintilla project needs pre-configured, according if boost does exist or not. \n. Notepad++'s License based on GPL v3 but modified. Please check the following link for more info:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-6.1.1-gpl-enhancement.html\nIt has been moved from PowerEditor/lisense.txt to LICENSE on the root.\n. checkSingleFile is a function to check if it's a single file or multi files, so it shouldn't display any message in this function. This issue is fixed in the latest commit.\n. Line Sorting is enhanced from v6.7.9.\n. It's an issue concerning Scintilla.. I just don't see any advantage in this patch.\n. @andreas-jonsson I confirm that XP SP2 itself is supported.\n. @TekBear \nI tried launch v6.7.7 on my XP SP2 without any issue.\n Could you try the zip package? \n. Your patch does all but fix the bug.\nThis issue is about the difference of google drive settings between Windows 7 & Windows 8.\nA friendly suggestion: For fixing a bug, don't guess but focus on reproducing the bug firstly. If you cannot reproduce it, then I prefer that you do nothing.\n. +1 for what he said @MAPJe71 \nOtherwise, bravo @andreas-jonsson : the performance that your patch provides is much better than the current one!\n. .git subdirectory is, normally a hidden directory under windows. So if you don't check \"in hidden directory\", find in files command will not search in .git subdirectory.\n. @milipili I agree with you totally.\nFollowing good guidelines is a good thing, but when people obey and apply the guidelines blindly, they are not good coders but just the slaves of guidelines. The term \"nazi\" is even a compliment for them. :)\n. @rcdailey +1 :)\n. curl lib used in WinGup doesn't support SSL. \nI'll make WinGup supports SSL ASAP.\nThe new WinGup will be included in the next Notepad++ release.\n. @milipili Awesome! Thank you!\n. As far as I know, a lot of developpers submit their pull request without testing in release mode. I prefer to keep make \"treat warnings as errors\" even in debug mode in order to avoid debug to release impact.\nHope you understand that.\n. @ericlaw1979 Thank you for your prompt! I got contact with DigiCert and they are willing to offer Notepad++ project a Code Signing certificate. We are seeing the procedure for getting the certificate.\n@tushevorg @GitMensch I may need your competence for code signing. I'll keep you update. Hopefully v6.9 will be signed with the new certificate!\n. @GitMensch I have no code signing experience (yet). And some points are not clear to me:\n1. It's certain that I need to sign the installer. Should I sign \"notepad++.exe\" as well?\n2. If I should sign \"notepad++.exe\", I suppose that I have to sign \"GUP.exe\" since this program (included in installer)  update and elevated privileges the download installer of Notepad++.\nWhat is your suggestions?\nEDIT: Just reviewed your suggestions of part of batch file - I'll sign all the binaries in the package.\nThank you!\n. @GitMensch I don't still figure out how to pass the arguments $%NPP_CERT% and $%NPP_CERT_PWD% into nsis script.\nAnd since:\n\"Especially under Windows Vista, installer/uninstaller binaries need to be signed to avoid alarming looking dialog boxes with dire warnings about \"unknown publishers\" etc.\"\nhttp://nsis.sourceforge.net/Signing_an_Uninstaller\nI think that we can safe to say that Vista can be ignored (with my windows 10, I didn't have warning on launching Notepad++ uninstaller).\nIf you got any idea about that, please let me know.\n. @GitMensch Thank you for the hint.\nI did check the page \nhttp://nsis.sourceforge.net/Signing_an_Uninstaller\nI do understand the idea of putting uninstaller outside to sign then put it back to the installer.\nHowever, I don't figure out yet how to adapt to Notepad++ current NSIS script.\nAny suggestion about that?\n. Thank you @ericlaw1979 for your answer. I guess I can close this issue then.\n. Use close button instead context menu for closing file then.\nSuch behaviour won't be implemented.. Diversity is our strength.\n:P. As l mentioned in the previous pull request, only new features and bug-fixes would be merged in the project.\n. Only new features and bug-fixes would be accepted.\n. @bviktor have you build Scitilla x64 with boost?\nEdit: ok, just read No Boost\n. @bviktor Thank you. It's not necessary now.\nI managed to make Scintilla 64 bit compile with boost.\nI'll commit the fix and instruction (readme.md) this evening.\n. There is no way to integrate a development of a feature progressively.\nYou would work on it on your clone repository and do the pull request once the feature implementation is done.\n. The guide lines (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-plus-plus-on-github.html) avoid that several features in a pull request. I do understand that a feature like 64 bits will be surely a big patch.\n. May I know the change you made?\n. I got a mail for updating these 2 lines. They are updated in the 6.7.8 version.\n. Nice patch. But then, I don't see the reason to keep \"Copy(with formatting)\".\nCould you remove \"Copy(with formatting)\" command and its code and make only one command \"Copy\"?\nPlease close this PR and create a new one because of conflict. \n. I'm not for merging the PR because it doesn't fix the bug but get around the bug by changing the current behaviour. I prefer fix the bug and keep the current behaviour.\nI will see what can I do for this bug immediately.\n. Non reproducible in the newest version.. @ariccio You fixed the bug, or you didn't fix it. There's no hope.\n. @rcdailey Basically I'm for your pr.\nI'm quite confused by the modification you made in commit \"Normalize all line endings\". I cannot see the different line endings from the diff. What did you change exactely? From LF to CRLF?\n. @rcdailey Sorry for the late reply.\nI will only accept \"Add .gitattributes file\".\nHowever, I checked line ending in question mentioned in \"Normalize all line endings\", I see no problem (they are all CRLF). Therefore there's no reason for me to accept \"Normalize all line endings\", for the following reasons:\n1. I have no idea what are changed in these files.\n2. that will break \"blame\" feature.\nI will close this pr.\nCould you do another one with only \"Add .gitattributes file\" please?\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n. @rcdailey \nIf it MUST be LF as line ending in the git repo, it'll be my job to transfer all CRLF to LF, but not some-else.\nPlease don't take it personally - that's the interest of code review.\nI will read these links again I promise you, and I will be back to you soon.\n. Already fixed before 6.7.8 release.\n. On my Windows 8.1 32bits machine is rather:\nbefore vs after => 1:13 vs 1:01\n12 seconds still count.\n. @NN--- Scintilla will be updated in 6.8 release.\n. Could you redo several pull requests by spliting this one (feature by feature)?\nThat will make the review and merge easier. Thank you.\n. It will need not only a lot of coding effort but also a lot of effort to maintain this feature since it'll be make more complex in the current code. Therefore this feature won't be implemented. Hope you understand.\n. I just update gitIgnore file. It should cover all cases.\nIf not, let me know, I could add more in it.\n. @andreas-jonsson \nFor me, Sort lines commands are Lines operations, so it should be submenu items of Lines Operations.\nThe 3 levels menu is still difficult to use.\nI suggest:\n...\nSplit Lines\nJoin Lines\nMove Up Current Lines\nMove Down Current Lines\n...\nInsert Blank Line Above Current\nInsert Blank Line Blow Current\n----------------------------------------- (SEPARATOR)\nSort Lines Lexicographically Ascending\nSort Lines As Integer Ascending\nSort Lines As Decimal (comma) Ascending\nSort Lines As Decimal (dot) Ascending\n----------------------------------------- (SEPARATOR)\nSort Lines Lexicographically Descending\nSort Lines As Integer Descending\nSort Lines As Decimal (comma) Descending\nSort Lines As Decimal (dot) Descending\nIt's not a problem to me that \"Sort Line\" being repeated.\nAt least it'll be clear for users.\n. > I know Don doesn't like const, but if a function takes TCHAR* then it's very difficult to pass a generic_string to it. That's why I changed NativeLangSpeaker::messageBox to take const TCHAR* instead.\nlol! It's not I don't like costant. I like it when it is reasonably used (like in this case that I've forgotten it). \n. @Rikk IMO, it's quite complicated to use it according your idea.\n. @andreas-jonsson  It's a good feature, but I would say it should be implemented as buttons for users. So it'll be more explicite.\nWhat do you think?\n. 1:42 (vs 1:13) on my 32 bits machine. Obviously my cpu can be classified as prehistoric one (Intel core duo 3.16 Ghz).\nI agree with @NN--- - I prefer /MT than /MD, so installer can be smaller and users install/launch Notepad++ without any error message.\n. @lychichem Could you provide your plugin list please? As well, your Windows 10 info (localisation).\n. @lychichem I believe your problem has been fixed in new release 6.7.9.1\n. Fixed in v6.7.8.1.\n. @NN---  For me the modification deserves into a new file which is only for VS2015 instead of being shared between VS2013 & VS2015.\nPlease create a new pr by adding your solution named \"notepadPlus.vs2015.vcxproj\". Then I will accept it.\n. It's a nice to have feature. However it makes current methods more complex (by adding more arguments on function argument list). I may find another way to do it.\n. Thank you @pnedev, this issue has been solved by setting xptool in vs2013. However there is another issue about winssl layer obsolet problem. I'm working on it.\n. @milipili \nhttps://github.com/npp-plugins/plugintemplate/blob/master/src/Notepad_plus_msgs.h\n. I think we can close this issue since there's only one file is mandatory.\nOf course @milipili please reopen it if you judge it's necessary to reopen it.\n. @NN--- Could you rebase your pull request so I can merge it automatically?\n. Thank you @NN--- \n. fixed. @ariccio Please check again your pr. Your pr has nothing to do with the fix of @andreas-jonsson.\n. \"notepad-plus-plus organisation\" is an attractive idea, but I think it's not yet the time, and I don't know from where should I start. Let's wait and see (for the best moment) :)\n. @Croydon Sounds good. I will create it.\n. Already implemented since long time.. @jay1109  Could you show us the screenshot please?\n. There was a CMAKE file for Notepad++ project. If you guys wanna maintaine it, I can find it and attach it here. Or you can create it from scratch. \n. @renyouguo \n\u4e2d\u897f\u6587\u5b57\u4f53\u5206\u5f00\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1f\u50cfword\uff1f\n\u5f88\u62b1\u6b49\uff0c\u6211\u9084\u662f\u4e0d\u660e\u767d\u4f60\u7684\u610f\u601d\u3002\n\u53ef\u5426\u8a73\u52a0\u8aaa\u660e\uff1f\u8b1d\u8b1d\u3002\n(\u5982\u6709\u5716\u7247\u66f4\u597d)\n. @renyouguo It's hard to implement this feature in Notepad++.

Ref 5: \nhttps://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. @rcdailey What do you mean \"decompose\" exactly? Make them in lib or dll?\n. @rcdailey \nDecomposing Notepad++ and building the key pieces as static libaries sounds a good idea for me.\nHowever this task will take time and there's no strong relation with CMakefile. \nFor me, CMakefile can be done with the current structure of project, and if you want you can create another issue for it and create another branch in your repository for building the static lib, with the suitable CMakeFile.\n. Another temporary solution here:\nhttps://github.com/hansrwindhoff/nppPluginTypescript\n. I confirm what @damien-gerard said: sqllite will be upgraded in the future version of Notepad++.\n. @andreas-jonsson My version of VS2013 is 12.0.21005.1\nOK, I see the problem - I will update my VS for the next release.\n. @andreas-jonsson  After updating to 12.0.31101.00 update 4 (under my 32 bits Windows 8.1), I can still reproduce this problem.\nOTOH, I cannot reproduce it with the binary compiled under my 64 bits Windows 8.1 by VS2013 12.0.21005.1.\nI believe that the problem is due to the difference of binary generated by VS2013 under 32 and 64 bits.\nSo far, all the releases are generated by my 32 bits machine. I will consider to generate the release by using another PC (64 bits).\n. Fixed.\n. @andreas-jonsson  Doesn't work for me. I believe there are somethings you forgot committed.\n. Sorry, my bad.\nI switched back again to the branch and relaunch VS and this time it works.\n. I'm quite sure that DlgProc did (in old VS version) return BOOL but not INT_PTR, and both BOOL and INT_PTR are typeof int. But indeed it'll be safer to change it, in order to pass to 64 bits.\n. @NN--- Yes, I'm thinking about it. Will be done in few hours.\n. @NN--- \nI will test it at home this evening. I don't see why I reject this patch if it compiles.\nSorry for the delay, but I have a daytime job to fill full my frige like everybody, and my family (especially my 7-years-old son) needs me when I am back home. I do my best to manage Notepad++ project, I hope you understand that.\n. The project was in the mode what you suggest. Unfortunately in the end I'm the only maintainer remained with some source code being difficult to be maintained.\nSo I don't see the other better ways so far than that the project moves forward with the speed I can provide.\nThank you for your comprehension.\n. The installer need administrator privileges to install Notepad++.\nNotepad++ is launched by installer after the installation hence it inherits administrator privileges.\nSo actually I don't see any way to drop this privileges.\nIf anyone get the idea, let me know. I'll implement it.\n. @NN--- After updating, will you have to modify scintilla source code? If yes, are there a lot of code to be modified?\n. @NN--- I'm gonna download Scintilla source of Release 3.5.6 from:\nhttp://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDownload.html\nAdapted and integrated into Notepad++ for next release.\nSo you can continue your 64 bits task.\nFor C++11 regex, I'm not against it if it is compatible PCRE, then it will be in future versions.\n. Fixed. (Tested in latest version)\n. @Rikk the standard ones. In the case of JS, those which are defined in ECMAS 6 and MDN.\n. Sorry for not seeing your PR, it'll be merged as soon as possible.\n. done:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/f02e567c9eccade8b56d372b2865788e0651f8a2\n. Could you provide more info about its behaviour, such as: if user double-clicks on a workspace file, what will it happen?\n. @andreas-jonsson  Use which PR?\n. OK, thank you.\n. Commenting the following line makes new style dialog back:\n//_ofn.Flags |= OFN_ENABLEHOOK;\nThen I googled the concerning issue I found:\n\"You are correct that it is impossible to get the new look when you use a hook. Instead you need to use the IFileDialogCustomize interface to customise the dialog. This is less powerful but does result in appearance and behaviour that is more consistent with the standard part of the dialog.\"\nin :\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4731218/ofn-enablehook-modifies-the-look-of-getopenfilename\nI guess this part should be recoded.\n. It's impl\u00e9mented.. @Eldaw I couldn't agree more.\n@ariccio Unless you wanna do some bug-fixes or add some new features, don't waste your time here. \nAs I mentioned in https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md :\n\"Only bug-fix and feature request will be accepted. For the other things, I can run static code analysis tool myself.\"\nFor the technical incorrectness in the code, I will do the fixes myself.\n. @Cyrillev91 It's interesting your modification, but I don't see any change and advantage for an end-user. Care to elaborate it?\n. The advantage we get from this feature is small, to compare with the price we pay - make simple function more complex.\n. We will use Yuni as lib for preparing the cross-platform application:\nhttps://github.com/libyuni/\n. Fixed.\n. @dail8859 It cannot be compiled due to missing a const TCHAR* val = n->Value(); line.\nCould you check it again? \n. Thank you @dail8859 \n. Without mentioning my personal dislike of polling per second, any PR should be implemented with a accepted feature request / bug repport. Otherwise your PR will take a great risk to be rejected.\n. Have you the instructions to reproduce this bug?\n. Fixed.\n. Sorry I won't take your pr due to the following rule:\nOnly bug-fix and feature request will be accepted.\nBut it will be fixed. Thank you.\n. @frewsxcv On the contrary, it encourage you to focus on bug-fix or adding of new feature.\n. Let's focus on code enhancement (bug-fix/adding feature) please.\n. In https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\nOnly bug-fix and feature request will be accepted.\nThank you for the correction of typo, but your pr is accepted. I'll fix them anyway.\n. We will, but not so soon.\nI think it'll be safe when VS2015 is in release. \nIn the meantime, we use VS2013 :)\n. I agree with @milipili - we might integrate VS2015 as main building tool, but it's too early to do it.\n. Because it's not an issue but the questions.. @milipili +1\n. Further info: notepad++.exe in v6.7.9 is built on 64 bits machine, whereas notepad++.exe in v6.7.8.2 is built on 32 bits machine.This changement makes DSpellCheck's behaviour changed. But still, it shouldn't hang.\n. Thank you @odysseuscm  for testing.\n@Predelnik Thank you for the fix. I'm asking 2 users to test this binary (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/acguqdqcxyyc846/DSpellCheck.dll). I'll keep you updated.\n. Thank you @dail8859 !\n@Predelnik It seems that binary you provide fix the hanging. Will you release a new version of DSpellCheck ?\n. Thank you @Predelnik !\nJust curious, what did make Notepad++ hanging and what is your solution?\n. @Predelnik OK! But I have to rebuild the release, and ask people test it again!\nCould you confirm that https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/download/1.2.14.1/DSpellCheck.zip\nIs correct for good?\n. @randyxxl Do you mean in 6.7.8.2 Notepad++ hangs also on quit?\nHow can I reproduce that?\n. @randyxxl Are you talking about v6.7.8.2 right?\nIf you remove DSpellCheck.dll, is the hanging problem solved?\n. Sergey ( @Predelnik , the author of DSpellCheck) has done some fixes. For people who got the problem Notepad++ hangs on close, Could you try this build?\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/6.x/6.7.9.1.prerelease/npp.6.7.9.1.Installer.exe\n. Fixed in v6.7.9.1 \n. @milipili I could not say better!\n@MattTheGeek In the Contributing.md the direction is given clearly, but there're no fixed rules for a pr - that's why we call \"pull request\" - by its nature, is a request.\n. Indeed! will be fixed in the next release.\n. @teddgram Fixed in v6.7.9.2\n@sanastasiou Bad news: AFAIK, there's no way to transfer the data from SF to reuse in GitHub.\nGood news: we got a new Forum (Notepad++ Community):\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community\n. @TheHause Sergey (the author of DSpellCheck) has done some fixes. Could you try this build to confirm us if Notepad++hangs always on close?\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/6.x/6.7.9.1.prerelease/npp.6.7.9.1.Installer.exe\n. @sanastasiou  We got new Notepad++ Community now:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/\n. @RobertSH I may be both stupid and arrogant, but at least this stupid arrogant person built Notepad++ and shares it freely with you. What have you done for us?\nIn the post I published on SourceForge, It's said clearly that all the forums in SourceForge will be closed in one week by providing the alternative solutions, and the reason was given:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/1290588/thread/9712e658/\nBeing part of community (like you), it's out of question to me to continue supplying SourceForge's scams by offering community's effort.\nAnd if you really do care about the community, contribute your time to build the forums. If they are good, then the community will come, and I will follow you.\nA free tip,\nThe meaning of open source project is, you have the freedom to get the source code for doing your contribution, instead of criticizing and whining in your corner.\n. @guy038 All the forums of SF can be accessed in read-only mode since this weekend.\nCould you come to \nhttps://gitter.im/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus\nso we could have a little chat on live?\n. @GitMensch  Hmm... Not yet. \n@milipili is working on it... hard.\n. SourceForge was a good place; unfortunately, sometimes good places don't last. It was a privileged spot for Notepad++'s users to share their thoughts and to contribute. We now need more appropriate tools to focus our efforts on improving Notepad++. GitHub is now the central platform for development and bug reporting. Even recently gitter.im was integrated for online chatting. But this is not enough, the community still needs its meeting place.\nLuckily NodeBB has found us. We love its sober design, efficiency and both rich/minimalist features. Come as you are, and use your (Facebook | Google+ | Github | Twitter) account to join us.\nWe are sure that you will enjoy it!\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/\ufeff\nThanks to @milipili !\n. @GitMensch  Could you close this pr and create a new one?\n. @GitMensch As you can see in master:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/functionList.xml\nnothing has been merged yet.\nWhat I need is a patch (but only one) based on it - is it possible?\n. @GitMensch Your modification make functionlist.xml an invalid xml file.\nCould you check again?\n. @GitMensch OK. Then please do a new PR with the same title: \"Add COBOL to function list\".\nI will close this one.\n. @GitMensch No, this PR is not merged. As it is ready, please open a new PR based on the latest Notepad++'s master. Then I will accept it.\n. It may be an intentional behaviour but it's surely a unexpected result for the most of users (including me). I'll check myself if @pnedev is not available.\n. Done\n. It's a very useful feature for some, but I believe not for all.\nFor the sake of keeping context menu brief and concise, these 2 commands won't be added in default context menu. Please modify your own \"contextMenu.xml\" instead.\n. Personally, I don't think it's a good idea - it could bring the confusion to users.. Fixed: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/f02e567c9eccade8b56d372b2865788e0651f8a2\n. @chcg There is an internal Scintilla update procedure ( https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/scintilla.original.forUpdating/scintillaUpdatingWorkFlow.txt ), and I will take care of Scintilla updating procedure personally.\nThank you for your patch anyway.\n. @aprovent  Could you provide your plugin list (the installed plugins) please?\n. Can anyone provide the instructions to reproduce the crash?\n. @azabluda Thank you: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/24bb021d711b64aa845da564cb7dfdcf26d1a19d\n. @Yaron10 Cannot reproduce it under my Windows 7. Works all fine to me.\n. @milipili We need a new label \"fxxk it, I'm in holidays\" :)\n. Cannot reproduce it.. gpup.exe is not part of Notepad++ project, but provided by a plugin of Notepad++ named \"Plugin Manager\".. Search \"Plugin Manager for Notepad++\" in github. Not reproduced in v7.5.1. It will add one more task on each release.\nI will consider it but I promise nothing.\n. I don't think this feature can bring a good advantage.. I got no intetion to force people to use Google Search Engine. I personally need this feature so I have done it. If anyone got idea to use the default search engine, please let me know - I'll certainly implement it.\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/e451efbd290f36300fe08a3b5be5460c5dd94f84\n. @taras-b I think it'll be better that Plugin Manager's DB is on Github, but I have to contact Dave Brotherstone (Plugin Manager's author) for this issue. \n@Rikk  The fact I don't accept your buggy PR doesn't mean that Notepad++ is my personal toy.\n. @Rikk If it makes you feel better that I \"accepted you fix\", then let it be. :)\n. @taras-b By \"Plugin Manager's DB is on Github\", I mean that there'll be more contributors to review the plugins, so @bruderstein won't be alone to process all the requests.\n. sqlite3 has been removed from Notepad++ project.\n. (Sigh) It means I cannot enjoy anymore to release funny version such as : \nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org//news/notepad-666-friday-13th.html\nFrom v6.8 Notepad++ will apply Semantic Versioning.\n. @g3candy  Could you update this PR please?\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/e451efbd290f36300fe08a3b5be5460c5dd94f84\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/e451efbd290f36300fe08a3b5be5460c5dd94f84\n. It's Notepad++ Updater issue and it's fixed in WinGup projet:\nhttps://github.com/gup4win/wingup/commit/ba47aeaacb434b94d00b3834a67e533cb4137be8\n. Fixed.\n. \"Make your modification compact - don't reformat source code in your request. It makes code review more difficult.\"\nref: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\nSorry, please do another PR w/o reformatting things.\n. This bug has been fixed in recent commit, the bug-fix will be in v6.8.1\n. @Zeriph It sounds cool.\nCould you update your PR (there are some conflicts currently) so I can check it please?\n. I don't think it's needed to be improved in About dialog.\n. Sorry for not replying immediately. I have a family with a 7-year-old child who needs his father constantly, and a daily job for filling up the fridge as all ordinary men, I got also some friends and am trying to have a social life.\nRegarding About dialog, there's nothing needed to be changed. Instead, I believe #694 responds better the need.\n. This is not temporary file but the original Scintilla release of current Scintilla.\nWhile updating a new version of scintilla, this scintilla will be compared with Notepad++'s scitilla, in order to get the patch for adding it into new scintilla release.\n. while @milipili is in holidays :(\n:)\n. @batagy \nPlugin translations will never be in localization file - not only because of maintenance problem, but especially the id of plugin commands are assigned dynamically.\nEnglish is updated in https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/b94767f5e6ebdd38ffc94c4d4b0c7f4eba8a0082\n. I can understand that some of these easter eggs could be appalled. But the part of quotes you want to remove could be appreciated by other people - we all don't have the same sense of humour.\nIn the future all these easter eggs will be in the plugins included by default (#545). User will be able to remove the easter egg plugin. So this commit is unnecessary.\n. Here's my favorite: \"Anonymous #22\"\n\"It's impossible.\" said pride.\n\"It's risky.\" said experience.\n\"It's pointless.\" said reason.\n\"Give it a try.\" whispered the heart.\n\"What the hell was that?!?!?!?!?!\" shouted the anus two minutes later.\n:)\n. This PR fixes the bug partially.\n. I cannot reproduce the bug:\n\nI know there might be nothing to do with plugins, but could you remove \"plugins\" directory then try again to make sure it's not about plugins issue?\nAlso it'll help if you can provide the info of your environment.\n. @uli-a I did some changes for this issue but I'm not sure if it is fixed since I cannot reproduce it.\nCould you download this file:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/temp/npp.7z\nunzip it into a new created folder, reboot the system (in order to process the test properly), then launch notepad++.exe.\nPlease let me know the result.\n. @uli-a Any input about it?\n. @uli-a So you have installed Source Code Pro BEFORE you use Notepad++ v6.8. Could you confirm me that?\n. Your installed Source Code Pro font doesn't handle & well. Update it will fix this issue.\n. @chindi-ap https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/9855/notepad-6-8-3-released\n. @h-h-h-h Sorry, don't get you. Could you elaborate it?\n. @h-h-h-h I'll do my best to close them.\n. I cannot reproduce the bug:\n\nI know there might be nothing to do with plugins, but could you remove \"plugins\" directory then try again to make sure it's not about plugins issue?\nAlso it'll help if you can provide the info of your environment.\n. @VictorJanikian I did some changes for this issue but I'm not sure if it is fixed since I cannot reproduce it.\nCould you download this file:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/temp/npp.7z\nunzip it into a new created folder, reboot the system (in order to process the test properly), then launch notepad++.exe.\nPlease let me know the result.\n. @VictorJanikian Thank you! Please let me know the result as you can!\n. @VictorJanikian  I believe that Source Code Pro had been installed in your system (before you use Notepad++ 6.8). Could you check in your font directory and confirm me this fact?\n. @VictorJanikian your installed Source Code Pro font should be updated.\n. On which zone? Could you elaborate?\n. I did some changes for this issue but I'm not sure if it is fixed since I cannot reproduce it.\nCould you download this file:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/temp/npp.7z\nunzip it into a new created folder, then launch notepad++.exe.\nPlease let me know the result.\n. @bakatrouble I am sure, from the picture you provided, it's not the instance of what I just compiled for test. The red underline shouldn't be there because it comes from DSpellCheck plugin; whereas there's no plugins included in \nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/temp/npp.7z\nIn order to process the test properly, could you reboot before testing?\n. This is an plugin issue andI saw you have posted on community:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/category/5/plugin-development\n. The patch fixes only when there's no document opened. However, if there's any opened document, then the new document's title is \"new 2\".\n. @Rikk Current implementation does have a bug: in the first situation where there's no opened document, the new blank document title is \"new 0\" - which is a bug. OTOH, in the second situation where there's an opened document, then if user opens a new blank document, its title is \"new 1\" - which is good.\nYour pr fix the first situation, but break the second one.\nWhat I will accept is a pr fixes the first situation, but not insert the regression.\nSounds fair enough for you?\n. I don't really understand you:\nWill you fix the PR or the bug?\nAnyway, you can do another PR if you get bug fixed, can't you?\n. OK then\n. \"new 0\" behaviour was the best compromise I could find to fix \"new 2\" bug.\nI'll check again if I can fix \"new 0\" without insert again \"new 2\" regression.\n. @Rikk  I will close this PR. And of course, I won't use this PR since it makes a regression.\nPlease redo a new PR when the bug is fixed without regression.\n. @Rikk Sorry I'm preparing a new release so I have no time to check the code and reply your question.\n\n(I still doesn't have VStudio installed so I can't test this kind of fixes myself, was doing this pr based on logic)\n\nPlease don't submit any PR if you didn't see the bug is fixed under your eyes - I think it's common sense for any software engineer, don't you think so? :)\n. @Rikk And you're using these placebo releases... or not.\n. Close due to the duplication.\n. Just checked some text editor (Atom and Sublime), this behaviour  (undo remove all) is the same in these editors. \n@milipili How is it in vim?\n. I think we keep this behaviour since it's a standard behaviour to me.\n. I could be wrong, but actually UTF-8 is heavily used in (almost) every application, and it became a standard.\nconfig.xml is not supposed to be modified manually. \nPlease use Preferences dialog for such job.\n. @A-SQLDEVELOPER Just upgrade to Windows 10 and install Notepad++ v6.8.\nI got no issue here. If you in tablet mode, you have to switch to the launched Notepad++ manually.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/805107/creating-multiline-strings-in-javascript\nSuch multi-lines string feature is supported in Notepad++.\n. It's a default behaviour of Scintilla for RTL languages, and unfortunately it doesn't work well for supporting such languages.\n. #678 is more updated.\n. Done\n. In NSIS installer all added texts are not translatable. I can do nothing about it.\n. > \"Border Width\" value 0 is not truly 0.\n\nSo, what's up? In Npp you can't use scrollbar when mouse it at rightmost pixel of the window\n\nAre you sure about it?\nI cannot reproduce what you describe while \"Border Width\" value is 0.\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/6c7ca02fea4aa64710c2eae1ab5192c49866dc6d\nThank you @dail8859 for the ref.\n. Your Notepad++ version please?\n. Version number please?\n. No need to make an PR. Make an issue.\n. @Arbitel Could you provide the step by step instructions so I can reproduce your issue?\n. This issue has been solved.\n. Unfortunately, that's all I can do with the current JavaScript lexer.\n. This is rather a Scintilla issue than Notepad++ one, isn't it?\n. It's rather Compare Plugin's issue than Notepad++'s one.\nPlease report the bug to Compare Plugin's author.\n. Fixed.\n. @gluehbirne Could you check this version:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/6.x/6.7.9.2/npp.6.7.9.2.bin.minimalist.7z\nand confirm me that you can still reproduce this issue?\n. It is done in the v6.8.2 release.\n. I guess this one is the most updated. Can we close #599 then?\n. Merged:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/da1abe066e5c0af7adce87660dbfb344e82d9526\n. @bheinsius Please try v6.8.2 (the latest release). This issue is fixed in this version.\n. I like the way it is right now.\n. There's nothing to do with the border value.\nIf you don't like WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE, please do a feature request on issue. I'll see what can I do about it.\n. Include sha1sum is a good idea but it'll need (much) more effort to implement it.\n. Fixed by #709\n. It's rather a Spell-Checker's issue than Notepad++'s one.\nPlease contact the author for the fix.\n. This PR is much better than the previous one - no more regression. \nHowever, it's not pretty at all in my original (white) theme.\nThis PR is about change the default behaviour but not a bug-fix or an enhancement.\nI'll think about it.\n. I will do a release this weekend, so I will take in charge of choosing the pr for merging in the next release. \n. @prclx323800 There is a conflict.\nPlease close this PR and remove commit regarding english.xml and create a new one.\n. Please and create a new PR and remove commit regarding english.xml.\n. I'm not for such \"enhancement\" due to the following reasons:\n1. the added 3 radio buttons confuse users and they make the usage of gotoline dialog less intuitive.\n2. The remembered number is not consistant - when you switch your document, the filed \"you are here\" and \"you can't go further than\" field are changed according the current document. Whereas \"You want to go to\" field are remain the old one - this is a bug.\nTo implement this feature properly, you should register the last search number in the current buffer, and get the number from the current buffer each time the field in question needs to be updated. That will make the code more complex for a small feature, therefore I won't implement it, and won't accept the PR for such feature.\n. @Rikk \n\nIf you don't like that option, you may want to set the default to another one.\n\nThat's how I understand in your statment: \"If you don't like the bug I implemented, just disable it\".\nNo, it doesn't work like this way. It's just pointless to insert a bug into a software on purpose.\nBesides the bug due to this feature, I agree totally with @dail8859 and the 3 huge radio buttons just make me think of a saying in French:\n\"crush a fly with a huge hammer\" - totally pointless.\n\nMaybe Donho would like, because he didn't understand the new options...\n\nNice try but fail. Try harder.\n. yes, I did read it.\n. I said in my previous comment:\n\nThe remembered number is not consistant - when you switch your document, the filed \"you are here\" and \"you can't go further than\" field are changed according the current document. Whereas \"You want to go to\" field are remain the old one - this is a bug.\n. I answered it as well in my previous comment:\nTo implement this feature properly, you should register the last search number in the current buffer, and get the number from the current buffer each time the field in question needs to be updated. That will make the code more complex for a small feature, therefore I won't implement it, and won't accept the PR for such feature.\n. Have you ever tested your pr?\nJust test it with several documents please.\n. @prclx323800 Could you provide your file so I can reproduce the bug?\n. It's a plugin issue and it's out of scope of Notepad++. Please report it to the Explorer plugin author.\n. There's a conflict! could you update this PR with Notepad++ master?\n. FYI:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/8202/notepad-new-release-6-8-2-updated\n. @rcdailey User Defined Language System is for non-buildin languages.\nI'll be glad to accept your pr regarding the updated keyword list of CMake.\n. @rcdailey I don't recall it but it should be before including CMake lexer in Notepad++, or I didn't see your patch, Sorry about that.\n\nRegarding the hard coding things in lexer, it's for the code fording. I don't think it will impact CMake syntax highlighting. Add the new keywords in langs.xml will do the trick (adding in langs.model.xml and removing your langs.xml then launch Notepad++).\nThe CMake lexer is not maintained by me, so I prefer to not modify it.\n. The patch of LexCmake.cxx : \nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/scintilla/lexers/LexCmake.cxx\nshould be submited to Scintilla project:\nhttp://www.scintilla.org/\nor you can contact the maintainer of CMaker lexer Cristian Adam (cristian [dot] adam [at] gmx [dot] net) to submit your patch.\n. @rcdailey Sorry for the late reply.\nIt works to me:\n\nI guess you modified the wrong stylers.xml.\nPlease check if \"doLocalConf.xml\" is present in your notepad++.exe directory. If yes, then you should modify stylers.xml of the same directory. Otherwise, in %APPDATA%\\Notepad++\\ folder.\n. I like DSpellCheck as well. However, DSpellCheck plugin has some stability issues and make Notepad++ hanging on exit for some configurations. That's the reason to remove it from release.\nFix in : https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/7b352fb43899c916fe1b4251f6bca384a380d276\n. @Rikk \n\nIf you ask me, it is like a freeware, with source available. There are a few people doing patches, but not a development community with people devoted to make it evolve.\n\nIf I were you and I felt the same way, I would go away.\nWhy are you still here to waste your time and my time? \n. @Rikk For accepting your buggy, non-tested PR? \n:D\n. There are a big amout of contributors of Notepad++ here (without mentioning before the migration to git) : \nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commits/master \nand if your PR are not all accepted, there must be a reason. \nKeep a common sense for the feature and do a quality PR then I will accept it. \nBut if you don't even test your submitted code, don't expect people accept it.\n. Thank you, I will check them.\n. I don't think there's any inconsistency between menu and status bar for eol.\nHowever, I'll think about CRLF, LF and CR on menu.\n. > PR of reformatting (changing of ws/TAB, line endings or coding style) of source code won't be accepted.

It's purely personal taste: I prefer the way it is now.\n. @KptainBiwouak No, why do you need such feature?\n. Please focus on bug-fixes and features, and please read :\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. I don't think there's any inconsistency between menu and status bar for eol.\nHowever, I'll think about CRLF, LF and CR on menu.\n. @Hero2006 A bug is fixed, or not. Therer's no \"Posible fix\".\n. @Hero2006 it's about New Document Default Settings, that is, when user creates a new document, he/she wants the new buffer applies to the New Document Default Language set in preferences.\nHow come we don't need this line?\n. m_nLen is the file length. No need to add the others variables for the same thing.\n. @timofey-retailnext\nstylers.xml will never be erased by installer since this file can be modified by users via Styler Configurator.\nIn v6.8 & v6.8.1, Notepad++ Installer put Source Code Pro font in Notepad++ installed directory, load it then use it, without interfering with system.\nIn v6.8.2, Installer removes Source Code Pro font if user upgrad from 6.8/6.8.1, and Notepad++ doesn't load Source Code Pro font, but use only the font in stylers.xml. If Source Code Pro font is in stylers.xml and user has installed it before, then it will be used.\n@h-h-h-h You can use Styler Configurator to set Default font as system font or remove stylers.xml so Notepad++ will regenerate it on startup. Otherwise there's no obvious way to solve it. \n. Currently all the embedded languages (except css) can be detected a in a html file and highlighted correctly, if all the syntax is correct.\n. Hi @VolkerWippel & @cmeriaux \nIt\u2019s fixed here:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/temp/npp.deadLockFixed.zip\nCould you test it and confirm me if this bug is fixed in the binary mentioned above?\n. @cmeriaux  Thank you for the info. I did another fix here:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/temp/npp_deadLockFix2.zip\nCould you try it with compare plugin please?\n. @cmeriaux Thank you for testing!\nI will check the PR and give you feedback soon.\n. @ywx Could you resolve the conflict of this PR?\n. @ywx Sorry for bothering you again, could you do a new clean PR please?\n. Such PR is not accepted. Do an issue instead.\nPlease check contribution guideline here:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. @Eldaw Yes, I confirm that this issue is fixed by https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/19476bbbaed6a0421d2f234839d8dbe40e663b37\n. Thank you for the PR. However, it'll be better to create an issue instead of PR for renaming or typo:\n\"Your pull requests are welcome; however, they may not be accepted for various reasons. If you want to rename some graphic items or fix typos, please create the issue instead of the pull requests.\" \nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/ba60fbdd715d647aa5ce7be5b6b75182b4a52951. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/19476bbbaed6a0421d2f234839d8dbe40e663b37\n. @CookiePLMonster So the following command:\nnotepad++.exe -z arg1 arg2 arg3\nTurns into: notepad++.exe arg2 arg3\nDo you confirm it?. @BobStein So you put Notepad++ and IE together for devaluing this current behaviour ? I see what you're doing here ;)\n. @sanastasiou Why do you need to have this infotmation?. @sanastasiou The correct way to get the info (TAB setting) you want is ask Notepad++ via API but not read from Notepad++'s settings file. For the sake of security plugins should access only to their space. \nOTOH, it's harder (and less reliable - since they could be changed in Notepad++) for plugin authors to retrieve info from xml file than using API.\nI would say you need rather NPPM_GETTABSETTING than NPPM_GETSETTINGSDIR.. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/4c9566923456af94b904bfa0db1f0c817a80be28\n. Fixed.\n. You can write your customizable command to invoke an external program to unzip log files, then read the file you want. Or implement a plugin for such purpose.\n. This is rather a bug in powershell lexer of Scintilla project.\nPlease contact its author for the bug-fix:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/scintilla/lexers/LexPowerShell.cxx\n. Indeed. It's quite annoying. There are a lot of restrictions in Administrator mode. I will see what can I do about that.\n. It seems the notification zone is locked (for the sake of security) while application is in Admin mode.\nAll I have to do is disable the tray icon mode while Notepad++ is in Admin mode.\n. It's not necessary since we've got 64-bit now.\n. PR duplicated.\n. @dg9ngf Are you ready to take this responsability? :)\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/6b16ba2ef32e62397d1f17bb7c7e4f1b592f102a\n. English, please?\n. @mihey78  Have you tried to remove all plugins?\n. @mihey78 @Neroldy  Thank you for the info!\n. @dail8859 What terminology are you suggesting to replace it?\n. It's rather a feature request for Scintilla (the editor component used by Notepad++).\nPlease check:\nhttp://www.scintilla.org/\n. I'm not sure if json5 is one of standard formats.\nWhereas all non popular xml extensions, they will be removed since xml's autodetection is implemented.\n. Scintilla can be compiled fully in x64\n. Sorry. I prefer the original one.\n. Unfortunately, Scintilla (the edit component used by Notepad++) doesn't have such feature. If such feature is in the future release of Scintilla, I'll include it in Notepad++.\n. > Note: if diskette icon column would be optional, file modification could be shown by making filename display in red color (instead of red diskette icon).\nI will consider it, but I don't promise that I'll do it.\n. The current GUI doesn't allows Vertical tabs with horizontal text. If there's any way for it (win32 API), please let me know. I'll consider it then. \n. Unfortunately, the color of icon for inactive bar is rendered by system, but Notepad++.\n. It'll be interesting when 64 bits is included in the release... in the future versions.\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/c059cc03dc0eab4ae40d61d291b0d05d4f006eb6\n. You can use \"save all\" command or you can just close all of them without saving - Notepad++ keep the modifications through the session for you.\n. @CNBLACK I see nothing changed in your update EXCEPT you added your name in the translator list.\nOr am I missing something?\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/2cbc6a7a99930b2b9837aa4f1c3a658698d8fb8f\n. Tried it out but it works to me.\nCould you provide me a more detail instructions?\n. @jturner77 Could you provide us your plugin list?\n. @dail8859 Indeed. I'll implement it.\n. closed due to lack of information.\n. I personally prefer hyphen than dash. \n. I cannot reproduce it.\nCould you provide the instrictions to reproduce it?\n. The gray disk icon means the file is read only.\nSo it's normal that you cannot save.\n. I can reopen the ticket if the bug can be reproductible - that means you reproduce it steadily and the detailed instructions to reproduce it are provided. Otherwise I can do nothing about it.\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/60b4aa6b75c60b436d1f3a539cd75956fbb98b3e. what is your plugin list?\n. Can you reproduce it steadily?\n. Your Notepad++ version?\n. @dail8859  Good point. \nPlease modify CONTRIBUTING.md then I will accept your pull request.\n. It's not a generic way to do it.\nYou can using tip (by hovering on tab) to get the full file path.\n. It's interesting to add UDL support for Tab settings, but not in this way.. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/bb2f771cbab13fafc40a2920769a2d97f6049175\n. @Croydon I know. I trigered sync button of github app by accident.\n. @linquize You're right about it.\n@opticyclic Please report this bug to Scintilla project.\n. If you got the problem of displaying & in Notepad++, please check the solution here:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/8202/notepad-new-release-6-8-2-updated\n. Already done.\n. @colejohnson66 To download your file, it needs to install MEGAsyncSetup.exe in which I don't trust.\nCould you attach your file directly in this issue?\n. Thank you @dail8859 !\n. Fixed PR #990 ?\n. @NN--- The suggestion was for me I think. \nThat says, what is done is done. It's not necessary to remerge for making a \"pretty\" commit.\n. why not? but why?\n. @gamzeakmann Cannot assign this issue to you.\nYou can always do the PR. if @Tmp341 approve your PR, I'll accept it and integrate it in the future release.\n. @Ede123 & @dail8859 \nWhat should be a correct behaviour to you?\n. @Ede123 So the current behaviour is correct, but there's an issue of flickering mouse cursor, right?\n. @Ede123 @dail8859 I can reproduce mouse flickering problem - it appears only on the message dialog. It's indeed a bug, but between the flickering and crash (and hanging) - I choose flickering :)\n. @Ede123 What I observe is as soon as I close the dialog, the flickering stops. Is not the case to you?\n. OK, now I can reproduce it.\nI have no idea (yet) how to fix it.\nHave you any suggestion?\n. What's the reason for such order?\n. Please check the comment of this commit:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/c2eb1e191970efcd4891455d8865a0f035440325\n. So there's no bug.\nIt'll be nice to close this issue while you realize it's rather a PEBCAK.\n. Neither Hex-Editor plugin nor Plugin Manager plugin is part of Notepad++ project.. It's good to clean up. But it's still unknown decision (if we restore the old behaviour or not).\n. @hanzworld @aaroneg I tested with an account non admin, I've got UAC popup for adm credential to install.\nCould you give me more details of your environment so I can reproduce your issue?\n. Nice enhancement!\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/8ac0aba68eed9fb37e75566be0b831ef5d79042d\n. I'm sure that is a false alert.\n. In order to take advantage of modern save dialog, the save dialog behaviour is changed in the 2 latest releases.\nThe old behaviour: if user chooses one of the filters, the file name will be concatenated with a file extension.\nThe new behaviour: the file name won't be concatenated with a file extension if a filter is selected. User has to add the extension manually. The filter is used only for filter files.\nIt's a standard behaviour.\n. the numbering system takes account into only untitled document. Once you save the document in the disk, it is no more untitled document, therefore the number is available again for numbering system.\nIt's a standard behaviour.\n. With what you connect to a particular server?\n. Could you provide more info about the difference of auto-completion between 6.8.3 and 6.8.5?\n. @tresdin Thank you for your explanation.\nAbout autocompletion part:\nv6.8.3\n{\n     //auto insert a tab\n}\nv6.8.5\n{\n//start at same position\n}\nCould you confirm me that it's in a javascript file that it doesn't work?\nRegarding auto-insert part:\nv6.8.3   (()),([]),({})\n    v6.8.5   ((),([),({)\nThere's no way back to the old behaviour, but I can always enhance it.\nCould you give me what you expect exactly (with the sequence of characters), I will see what can I do for it.\n. > { ( [ \" ' `` should be auto-close whether or not they are being inserted inside each others. This feature should not be applied inside string context (_inside\"\" '' ```_).\nIt's the case already.\n. @ganego  v6.8.5 handle it quite good: [[[{{(([[\"\"]]))}}]]]\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/7781f1d03ed8f2807764e5c08bf64f4d37d4bad3\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/17e5e4ea6dab8c6de909796e01026865aa74e79d\n.

Rename your folder \"plugins\" to \"foo\" (located on C:\\Programme Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\plugins) \n3.

Hi @neo291 Thank you for your update.\nAfter checking the source code, it seems to me https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/11accf92e93c574d60ef6a0c19a368d8957a68bb is a simpler and more intuitive fix.\nThank you for your contribution!.

Current behaviour is the concist way to keep this feature work, change the current behaviour could bring the regressions.. AFAIK, .profile, .bash_profile, and .bashrc are the file name but not file extension, so the PR doesn't work for that.\n. @cmeriaux Just tested - you're right.\n. Could you provid a example of url which doesn't work in the current version?\n. It's not enough to add language you want to support such language.\nPlease don't waste our time - test your commit before doing your pr.\n. Thanks. I will fix this typo.\n. Thank you. I will fix these typos.\n. I don't see what kind of clarification can be done by your pr.\n. Your PR has erase the newest necessary modification.\n.

I'm thinking WITHOUT Boost part - since it generates a lot of problem.\nWhat do you think?\n. I mean to build SciLexer.dll in Appveyor without building boost:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus#to-build-scilexerdll-without-boost\n. > appveyor could be our official builder\n\nIt can't be.\nThere's a signing procedure to sign all binaries.\nappveyor will only be used for checking the pr & commit.\n. I don't see the advantage of nightly build either - without boost PCRE, some of features in Notepad++ will be broken.\nIf people need last snapshot, they can pull from master and build their version themselves.\nOnce again, appveyor to me is only used for checking the pr & commit.\n. @cmeriaux \n\nOk, we keep boost.\n\nYou miss my point. I don't want to keep boost. \nIt takes time for each build and could be failed due to boost.\nThe part of boost will be removed. OTOH, the part of x64 will be added.\nAppVeyor will be used only for checking of coherence of x64 and x86 notepad++.exe/scilexer.dll build.\nFor whom needs Nighty build, they can check out notepad++.exe from the latest build artifacts.\nI'll take in charge of this.\n. Please check contribute.md\n. Fixed. It'll need 1 day to take effect.\n. @dail8859  Thank you.\nMake it 1 commit (by using rebase) please.\n. @dail8859 Please commit your PR directly into master when they are accepted.\nThank you.\n. @gnbl Could you provide 2 screenshots : before and after?\n. @gnbl Your PR fix partially the problem (only one theme).\nI'll accept if you provide a patch which fixes in all themes.\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/1abac157993685c4f6345443f6256403526858ad\n. rAndOM cASE lOL !\n.

Since file name doesn't contain '\\' (ie. c:\\temp),  a '\\' is always added on folder path which has no '\\' at the end. it works for none root folder such as C:\\, E:\\ or F:\\.\n.

Are you telling me that your function list is better than current one?\n. @MAPJe71 Thank you for the elaboration.\nIn this case, could you do a PR for the parsers that we are sure they are better than current (with the header in comment which gives the explicite explanation)?\nRegarding your SF's PR, I have checked it - the reason that the PR was not accepted is the dificulty of its integretion - it was kind of rewritten and hard to tell what is fixed/enhancend. \nI believe some enhancements have been done in your patch. What I want to make sure is there'll be no regression. If you could do some effort to do PR again (without reformatting and change of code structure) , I'll check it again (and sorry for the inconvenience).\n. > Do you mean an explanation for the improvements or the regular expressions or both?\nBoth. The improvements which work only for the current Notepad++ of course.\n\nI will create a separate PR for this and include the optimized parsers which dependent on this patch (with explanatory comment, before/after comparison\n\nThank you very much.\n. @davehowland It will be fixed in next release by using the newest version of NSIS.\n. @sailorerik is it possible to make Estonian complete (updated to Notepad++ 7)? \n. @sailorerik Provide your update if you want, then open this PR.\n. @Tmp341 Please update your PR for 7.0\n.

Therefore this PR won't be accepted.\n. @cmeriaux I see your point, but my choice remines the same.\n. @cmeriaux I don't think it's a good idea.

I'll merge them once it's finished.\n. So which one should I take? #2375 or this one?\n. @SinghRajenM It's hard to review your code with all the commits. Could you make 7 in 1 so I can check it easier?\n. @cmeriaux Thank you for the tip.\nBut it's not my point.

OTOH when I execute nmake -f scintilla.mak, I've got the following error :\n```\n        link -OPT:REF -LTCG -DEBUG -LIBPATH:c:\\sources\\boost_1_55_0\\bin.v2\\libs\\regex\\build\\msvc-12.0\\release\\address-model-64link-static\\runtime-link-static\\th\nreading-multi -DEF:Scintilla.def -DLL -OUT:..\\bin\\Scintilla.dll .\\AutoComplete.obj .\\CallTip.obj .\\CaseConvert.obj .\\CaseFolder.obj .\\CellBuffer.obj .\\Character\nCategory.obj .\\CharacterSet.obj .\\CharClassify.obj .\\ContractionState.obj .\\Decoration.obj .\\Document.obj .\\EditModel.obj .\\Editor.obj .\\EditView.obj .\\Indicato\nr.obj .\\KeyMap.obj .\\LineMarker.obj .\\MarginView.obj .\\PerLine.obj .\\PlatWin.obj .\\PositionCache.obj .\\PropSetSimple.obj .\\RESearch.obj .\\RunStyles.obj .\\Select\nion.obj .\\Style.obj .\\UniConversion.obj .\\ViewStyle.obj .\\XPM.obj .\\HanjaDic.obj .\\ScintillaBase.obj .\\ScintillaWin.obj .\\BoostRegexSearch.obj .\\UTF8DocumentIte\nrator.obj .\\ScintRes.res KERNEL32.lib USER32.lib GDI32.lib IMM32.lib OLE32.LIB OLEAUT32.LIB\nMicrosoft (R) Incremental Linker Version 12.00.40629.0\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

That's absurd since you're providing a fix for x64, or am I missing somethings??\n. Nice patch.\nAll OK for me except one point: . match newline should be in the same line on Regular expression.  That makes more sense since it's an option of RE.\nWe should make translation shorter.\nThis PR will be accepted if this modification is removed.\n. @SinghRajenM Please make 1 commit for per PR\n. @pshashank8 You cannot just go to see the doctor by only telling him/her \"Cure me please, I'm sick\". \nSo we can do nothing about your report.

But If it bothers you really, feel free to reopen it with more arguments and informations.\n. @SinghRajenM  I just don't understand why it's always several commits in your PR?\n.

Your description is confused.\n. Autocompletion feature is a generic function for all surppoted languages, so the modification for adapting only for VB will make autocompletion break for the other languages.\nvb.xml needs to be modified for removing all the entries contain space, and make all keywords in UPPERCAS or lowercase according the convention. I'll see what can I do for make ignore the case of keyin to trigger auto-completion.. There's already a feature named incremental search which does the same thing (CTRL+ALT+I).\nI prefer to not mix the both so user can choose the different GUI, and of course, no regression.\n. I cannot reproduce this behaviour\n. 64-bit version could handle more data in memory theoretically.\nThis issue regards the way scintilla process the data (no incremental load) but has nothing to do with x64 version.\n. A pull request could make such request more valuable. Otherwise I'm not a fanatic of software license to do a lot of effort for fixing it.\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/4a0e880557f8cf515b93d8828f887292a1a669a2.

It will be time consuming\n2. Not all the translations are synchronized with english.xml\nCould you show me the lines in your python script to valid the xml ?\n. The goal of using AppVeyor for translation is to make sure the PR for translation of nativeLang.xml is valid xml.\nWe don't need (and don't want) the parser to check if the translation file's structure is conformed with nativeLang.xml, since it'll be time consumming, and especially only few translations conain all translated node, so there'll be a lot of error.\n. > You can use it to build SciLexer.dll and notepad++.exe in one step with Visual Studio 2015.\nWith or without RegEx of boost ?\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/3e3cbe0c22c0f574736fca6a999ba250d95df22a\n. No empty template. Please add only lexers you need.\n. @chcg \n\nremaining task is the wincontrol \"ReadDirectoryChanges\", which uses ATL, propably not available with mingw\n\nSo the makefile doesn't compile at all, does it?\n.

I don't think this feature can bring a good advantage.. @RudivanHemert @emersonmellado @atlason I cannot reproduce it under my Windows 10 with both 32 and 64 bit Notepad++ - is there anything special in your configuration?\n. The provided instructions is even more confused to me. OTOH, we prefer the PR for the Notepad++ binary.\n. @dail8859 is this regression is related to the commit: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/a82d9f9981271ae5230e145d8fdc5e86e6a6a42d ?\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/60b4aa6b75c60b436d1f3a539cd75956fbb98b3e. @MAPJe71  Do you approve the new commit codes? Does this PR improve the recognition of function name?\n. Probably not GPG but sha256 will be provided in the next release (sha512 will be done as well in the future). @beerisgood \nI did try GPG signing, and different from Winows' code signing certificate, the signature is detached. So here my question: which API in C++ should I use to verify the signature? Do you have any example about the implementation?. @saelic \n\nWTF\n@donho I posted the solution in 2017 in this very thread! #2524 (comment)\n\nCertum? They are my nightmare:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/17184/remove-code-signing-from-notepad. @saelic \n\nYou are talking about validating those files from the application itself.\nWe are talking about signing the installer files - exe, zip, 7z.\n\nMaybe I still stay on Microsoft signing system logic and don't get yet GPG usage. \nIs there no way to validating the GPG signature of its component inside of Notepad++ ?. @saelic @bughit \nThank you for your information.\nI will check them and make GPG signature available ASAP in Notepad++.. >  I didn't even think that you were talking about signature validation during runtime (which of course is cool). \nIt's part of stuff I pay attention now thanks to CIA:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.3.3-fix-cia-hacking-issue.html. > Back to the Certum thing: why you don't want to just give them your name? Then the CN would look like \"Open Source Developer, Don Ho\".\nThe thing is, Don Ho is not even my official name (on my passport). The CN name is hard coded in the source code for the certificate verification of inter-component. And I don't want to people be able to dig my personal info so easily.. > Also a just malicious entity can find a homeless person, wash him, pay him for changing his legal name to Don Ho and pay him for getting a valid cert in a completely official way.\nThat's a brilliant idea! Thank you @KOLANICH  :P. So I just created a GPG key pair (RSA 2048) with Notepad++ &  don.h@free.fr attached (I suppose it's the certificate). I did the key pair backup and did a revoke certificate. So what's the next step?\nHow do I sign my binaries and how do I verify the signatures with the signed binaries?. @KOLANICH 4096 is not minimum but maximum in Kleopatra's option.\nRegenerated. So what should I do now?. @KOLANICH :\n\nGo to https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/ and paste there your public key. \n\nIn Kleopatra there's a command Publish on server... - is it the same thing?\n\nwho are well-known devs, to sign your public key (offline, meeting them personally!)\n\nI don't know any well-known-devs. Is this part is mandatory?\n@saelic \nHow people under windows verify the signature with signed notepad++.exe ?\n\nremove the \"check if you are paranoid\" label\n\nDone, it will take effect in few hours.. @saelic \nThank you for your very detailed info.\nJust sign my commit on git with a beautiful verified : \nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/5356f648c21a1bc6fc96dcb9078bddce9dadcc37\n\nNot authenticity, but integrity. Authentication can only be verified with digital signature.\n\nMakes sense. Modified.\n\nWhich signature algorithm/hash you've selected for your key?\n\nRSA\n\nAre you using some good antivirus program on your build machine?\n\nWhich one do you suggest?\n\nAre you looking towards making builds reproducible?\n\nI don't really get your question, could you elaborate it?.

Please try again later.\n\nAll of which are under either NSA or GCHQ jurisdiction.\n\nNot for Notepad++ website & its binaries - they are hosted in France.. @saelic \nHow can I know about signature hash algorithm from kleopatra or gpg comes with git?\n\nI would suggest Kaspersky products. \n\nI've installed Kaspersky (free version?) long time ago, and I had some performance issue due to it. I'll give it a try again.\n\nWe are living in times where multiprocessing is used on the global scale. That's why the underlying mechanisms of doing the same things may differ.\n\nThank you for the info!\nBTW, I'm preparing the next release : All packages will be signed with the private key I generated. \nI will provide the signature (a detached gpg file) for each released package, and also my public key in asc format on download page. Am I missing somethings ? . The above public key has been submitted in the following keyservers:\nhttp://keys.gnupg.net/\nhttps://keyserver.ubuntu.com/\nhttps://pgp.mit.edu/\nhttps://zimmermann.mayfirst.org/\n. Here's a signature test on my old release. Could you guys tell me if everything is OK on this page?\n(Verifying of signatures & checksums, the terms used in the content, etc...)\nIf everything is OK, I will use it as template for the future release.\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.5.html. @saelic Thank you for your verification.\n\nYou haven't signed the packages, you encrypted or probably signed and encrypted them.\n\nFixed.\n\nI would change the Authenticity/Integrity label to Integrity & Authenticity validation. For the sake of order of things.\n\nIndeed it's better. Done.\n\nThere are no SHA-512 checksums.\n\nIt'll be added in the future. Currently, we do without it.\n\nThere is no signature for source code package.\n\nThe source package is downloadable in release page of github. It's OK to me if we can do it on github  in an automatic way. Otherwise I don't make more charge in release process. \n\nKeep in mind that you can also sign release notes as text - it's common practice for example in mailling lists, for example here. As you can see, the signature is attached to the end of the message as ASCII string.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but In Windows people prefer see the text less \"encrypted\". So I prefer to keep the signature detached. \n\nPlease try the arrangement using table - look how nicely.\n\nHmm... let's keep the old way for the moment.. > It's really nice to hear any appreciation when security people do their stuff. It's really hard and sad when nobody notice what has been done, people are often in doubt if what they are doing makes any sense. \nThere's no doubt to me for sure. The problem is the devs want their codes work quickly, and while everything works fine, the security experts are the balls breakers who impose a lot of restriction to make their implementation (in the na\u00efve and easy to be maintained way) harder, until their software get hacked...\nThank you (and others) very much for the help. I'm kind lucky to get all the assistance from you.\n\nI would add are the links to your public key on:\n    GitHub\n\nDo you see my public key for signing the commit? If yes, could you provide me the link? Otherwise how can I publish it on github?\nIs it a good way to push it in the repository as a file:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/npp.gpg.pub.key\nso it can be published as:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n?\n\nAlso I think it's good idea to put package with source code on the main server, together with binaries. It's the integral part of the project, so I think it should be in one place. And then you can also provide signature for it.\n\nI will consider it.\n. @saelic @bughit \nJust added it:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/README.md. @saelic \nGood suggestion.

In C, it's better than old one (according the sample I use to test), and I like the idea of parameters including .\nHowever, not all macros are detected, and one wrong entry (see attatched file).\nINFBLOCK.zip\n. Java : I have tried with attached file, and got the following declarations are listed as function entries:\nJava\n    native public void onErrorNative(int what, int extra, long id);\n    native public void onBufferingUpdateNative(int percent, long id);\n    native public void onProgressUpdateNative(int progress, long id);\n    native public void onDurationChangedNative(int duration, long id);\n    native public void onInfoNative(int what, int extra, long id);\n    native public void onVideoSizeChangedNative(int width, int height, long id);\n    native public void onStateChangedNative(int state, long id);\nFor me, function list provides only entries of function denition. What do you think?\nQtAndroidMediaPlayer.zip\n. It seems OK for me for Batch and Bash. Good work, @MAPJe71 . > Q: How should functions contained in a macro be listed?\nI'm not an expert of NSIS, but I'm sure that a macro can contain several functions - the sample I provided is a piece of code come from a compilable nsis file. Unfortunately I cannot provide you the whole code source here.\n\nMacros are a PITA :)\n\nMacro entries is a \"nice to have\" feature. However, it's not indispensable in \"function\" list. :)\n. @MAPJe71 Please let me know while C and NSIS are fixed.. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests. @MAPJe71  Could you review and validate this PR please?. @MAPJe71  Are all the improvement in this PR included in https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/3393 ?.

So it's been known to happen with color picker? I've removed it. Anyway, if the crash occurs again, I'll let you know here. This was the first time, had the same thing a year or two ago with an older version but not since, the real problem is not the crash, but that the file gets wiped out. \n\u2014 \nYou are receiving this because you commented. \nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub , or mute the thread . \n. @SinghRajenM \n\nI see, there already exists a code to open a file which comes from context menu of Lower Integrity Level explorer while npp is running at higher integrity level. So we should handle drag n drop in same fashion, shouldn't we.\n\nSure. I just haven't found the way to do it with D&D feature. It'll be more than welcome if your PR overcomes such problem entirely.\n\nThis way we can process WM_DROPFILES message as well. So with updated code (present in this PR) npp works exact same as non-elevated except one point. Still drag n drop is not allowed on scintilla edit view (editable portion).\n\nIt's not really neat on user experience - some zones work and some doesn't.\nObviously, we have to hack in editor component ( that I always try to avoid).\nThis patch would be accepted if the patch for Scintilla is small and concise, otherwise it's rather somethings which is not helping users IMO - they don't have necessarily the docking dialog and even they do, that creates the confusion.\n. @eglibicky \nNice PR. I've got some question though.\n\n\"Same name merge\" will replace existing finder will a new result of search with the same name\n\nSo it's the current behaviour if it's checked?\n\n\"Only one finder\" will create and maintain only one finder and replace it every time when there is a new \"Find all\" or \"Find in Files\" searches\n\nif the first checkbox and second checkbox (this one) both check, what will happen?\n\n\"Show line once\" will show only one line of code in finder, if multiple finds in the same line\n\nIt's a great feature, but can both occurrences are highlighted in the same line?\n\n\"Close empty\" will close all finders with 0 finds on the next search\n\nIt seems it has some bugs, I'll check again to make sure.\n. @yasmise  A newest translation is available: \nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/installer/nativeLang/english.xml\nCould you update your PR with the new translation please?. @yasmise Sorry again for the request, but I just add a new feature and several new translation:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/6a05bedd05cbfce40106aa464e43448639d1913b#diff-2a8496e2537c34b95cbeca007cd2346b\nCould you update the PR again please?

Once we have unit test system for parsers we can integrate any modification.\nHave you any idea for building such system ?. @MAPJe71  The unit test system I use in my job (forget its name) needs to export all methods to test, each method will be compiled to a exe. They'll be launched after compiling to generate the result for comparing.\nSuch system doesn't work for Function list since all the parsers (regExprs) need Scintilla to evaluate the result.\nI would say run compiled Notepad++ with divers source files to compare the function string output with the expect result, but I don't know yet how.\nIf you have any idea, please let me know.. @MAPJe71  I'm trying to make function list unit test happen, here is the first draft of interface:\nnotepad++.exe -funcListTest=L_CPP,msgboxOn,errLogOn,c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.result c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.cpp\nif not ok show message box (opt) & write a log (opt) & exit (opt) return -1 \nif ok exit return 0.\nWhat do you think?. @MAPJe71  \n\nWhy not have Notepad++ export the parse results and have the test logic (i.e. compare export with expected result) in a script or separate executable? \n\nBy \"export\", do you mean write the strings into a file?\nThe approach that I suggested could be done  without installation any script, that allows anyone test his/her RE very easily (for example, for user languages).\nWe do need scripting to execute every unit test anyway.\n\nWhen having more tests implemented in the future for other parts of Notepad++ I would redefine the arguments in order not to \"polute\" the CLI to much e.g.\nnotepad++.exe -test=funcList,L_CPP,msgboxOn,errLogOn,c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.result c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.cpp\n\nI'll consider this point.\n\nWhen not required (see 1) i.e. export the parse results, the command line interface (CLI) could be changed/simplified to\nnotepad++.exe -export=funcList c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.cpp\n\nwe need LangID still - the file extension could be used for several languages\n. @MAPJe71 Exported file could be JSON, however it'll be in the first implementation.\nHere is the 2nd draft (I just remembered that we have -l flag).\nCommand:\nnotepad++.exe -export=functionList -lcpp c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.cpp\nthe behaviour:\nNotepad++ will open \"c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.cpp\" as C++ source file, and write result to c:\\funcListTests\\cppTest.result - the old cppTest.result will be erased by the new one.\n\nDo you have a preference for a scripting language or maybe a preference which not to use?\n\nNot yet. What is your suggestion?. > Wouldn't it make more sense to have the file extension of the result/export file reflect the used file format?\nIndeed, it'll be:\nc:\\funcListTests\\whatever.cpp.json \nThank you @MAPJe71 for these very detailled comparisons. I'll think about it.\n@milipili I do remember that you told me that Unit test will be part of nany. What is its status? Is it usable immediately? (It's about comparing 2 result files, for the moment)\n. @MAPJe71 \nPlease check the commit https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/1d58c1d3d3ae8d7c84da196be7cc051c0f87598a in which fuc list explort is implemented (with no json).\nPlease let me know if there are somethings missing.. @MAPJe71 \nLet's go with Javascript - Would you like to take in charge of it? . @MAPJe71 Please check the fix here: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/78ea2110d283e7a89f8fef66d097023521114afe. @MAPJe71 I'm exporting functionList in JSON.\nCould you give me a Json for the following function list?\n\n. Thank you @MAPJe71 \nWouldn't be better to remplace  branches by nodes ?. @MAPJe71 FYI (if you didn't chech the latest commits): function list export feature has been enhanced - in json format now.. @MAPJe71  Just wanna know the progression of unit test for function list?\nAre you blocked at some points? May I help ?\n. @MAPJe71  Js in FunctionList has been broken since September 2016 due to this commit:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/5d438aa08250e3389a77cd3635763ac4c20a36be\nand maybe (since November 2016) due to:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/fb189fa247324cb84b1b4de1ea174be29cd98680\nUnitTest for FunctionList is needed d\u00e9finitively!. @MAPJe71 Why .editorconfig is added?. Please provide more description of your PR.\nMore accurate and detailed your explanation (with screenshots BEFORE/AFTER if possible), more chance that I take my time to review your PR.. @tonyk24 Thank you for the explanation.\nCould you please indicate me how to reproduce the bad allocation?. \nIf you can remove also the upper left icon, without changing any current behaviour, I'll accept your PR.. > Did you use WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW just to remove the system menu from the dialog windows?\nYes, this still is for removing the system icon but keeping the close button.\n\nPS: I can do this change as well and check the results. It will just take another day or so, as I'm a bit busy at the moment.\n\nOK, then I close this PR. You can reopen it when you've done what I requested.. @SinghRajenM  For \"ProjectPanel.cpp\", Could you point out where is th epossibility of a memory leak?. @SinghRajenM OK, I see.\nI don't like to do a lot of modification which could bring regression for fixing an eventual memory leak.\nPlease just add delete pXmlDocProject before each return false.. please redo your PR... if it's really needed : \nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md. @irgendsontyp Thank you for your contribution.\nHowever, it's a small feature need a lot of change in codes, not mention to additional option to make UI more complicated. \nAs a result, this feature won't be included in the official release.. I have no problem to compile under VS2017. VS2013 will be outdated. We are using VS2015 & VS2017 with the old vcxproj currently and it works fine.. Quick play around, I've found 2 regression regarding \"Find All in all opened documents\" & \"Find All in current document\"\nThe option doesn't belong to \"Search Engine Setting\" clearly.\nWhen I search a very long sentence, it creates a very long tab, which is awkward.. Which process would read the command line?\nAny concrete example? . I see.\nHowever, it misses a free on the pointer that strdup has allocated.\nAnd I prefer to do the allocation near where it needs.\nI've done a fix. Thank you for your PR anyway.\n. @Cyrillev91 Could you provide the reason to comment these lines? (The explanation that it fixes the issue but won't trigger any regression). c748d8d18b770ea9fddfef4d71e75697a9cdca7d. It has been fixed.. \"localization\" branch already exist.\nPlease recreate a new branch for each PR next time.. This PR cannot be applied because it's based on the old branch which contains a commit merged in master.\nPlease create a new branch for your PR, and ALWAYS one NEW branch for one PR.. Thank you @jay !. @tonyk24  Nice one. I didn't think about Replace button while the deletion of direction option. \nHowever, why don't we do << replace & replace >> - with the same logic of find ? . @tonyk24  Does the direction really matter for users while replacing all ?\nI don't think so. We need only choose a direction for this operation.. @tonyk24 Indeed, as @dinkumoil mentioned about, if there's no wrap, replace all without direction will be an issue.\nI'll think about it.. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/4d921b7ffd3b5d077c618b5e87fc483db65f63e8. @cmeriaux  Nice PR.\nNo need to redo the PR, please just add new commit for my change request in this PR.. @cmeriaux  \n\nI didn't change anything to avoid regression. Do I fix it ?\n\nNo, please leave it as it is. They are being used for the translation.. @cmeriaux  please remove duplicated code.. @cmeriaux  It seems you add your new commits on the old branch which has been merged since long time.

Will be in the next release. Wrong file to modify.\nWill be in next release.. Use \"User ext.\" in Style Configurator to define your custom extensions.. I really don't like dynamical allocation. The allocation costs, even in our miniscule case, not even mention to  the delete operation - why bother if you can use static automatic variable?. OK, I will take it as it is.\nI will modify myself for using a automatic variable with static size.. @jiyoung211 \nThere are still a lot of missing entries.

Don't use AngryGamer:master as branch name for the next time.. @CookiePLMonster \n-z option works fine with reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\notepad.exe\" /v \"Debugger\" /t REG_SZ /d \"\\\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\\\" -z\" /f (ie. no notepad.exe opened in Notepad++)\nHowever, if double click on a file name contains space, new file.txt for example, Notepad++ will treat as 2 file new & file.txt.\nAny solution for that?\n . @Big--Mike \n\nThat's because notepad registers file types to run with notepad.exe %1 instead of notepad.exe \"%1\".\nIt's working in Notepad, because Notepad analyzes its command line parameters. If the parameters build a path to an existing file, the parameters will be merged to one file path and the file will be opened.\n\nThank you for your answer. So is there any way (to add a reg command for example) to work around this problem?. > I think this must be done in the Notepad++ program logic itself.\n+1. > Do you think joining all arguments on space and checking if that result points to an existing file is sufficient?\nI think it's sufficient.\nHowever, there'll be a lot of ambiguous cases to manage since there are a lot of arguments which could be passed to Notepad++.. > As Notepad++ supports plenty parameters on any position, it's not so easy there.\nYou could optionally make this behavior dependent from the -z switch.\nYes, indeed. Let's treat such problem only in -z, but not globally.\n\n-- if the argument is /p, add -quickPrint to the future command line and throw the argument away\n\nNice to have feature. See:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/3987\n\n-- if the argument contains a space, put it into quotes and add it to the new arguments string (it was already quoted in this case)\n-- if the argument doesn't contain a space, simply add it to the new arguments string\n\nSounds good to me.\n@CookiePLMonster Will you enhance in this PR?. > Do you think it still makes sense to call it -z or maybe rename to something else indicating \"notepad compatibility\"?\n-notepadCompatibility is quite long, what's your suggestion?. > (please don't call it -skipFirstArg...\n@Big--Mike  Why not?. notepad++.exe arg1 arg2 -z will make notepad++.exe arg2 or am I missing somethings?. @CookiePLMonster Just wanna know if you will enhance this PR for managing the space in the argument given?. Thank you @CookiePLMonster !\n@Big--Mike I suppose that you have tested the '/P' transformation?. @CookiePLMonster  double click on a file name contains space, still doesn't work with this PR (for example, Notepad++ will treat \"new file.txt\" as 2 file new & file.txt).\nAm I missing somethings?. so we should pass both -z and -notepadStyleCmdline ?. I run the following command again, still doesn't work:\nreg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\notepad.exe\" /v \"Debugger\" /t REG_SZ /d \"\\\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\\\" -z -notepadStyleCmdline\" /f\nAnd even -z dosn't work anymore (notepad.exe is opened in Notepad++).\nWhat's the command to use exactly?. OK, got it.\nIt's rather reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\notepad.exe\" /v \"Debugger\" /t REG_SZ /d \"\\\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\\\" -notepadStyleCmdline -z\" /f. Why do we need to separate -z & -notepadStyleCmdline anyway?\n-z alone could do both things, or am I missing somethings?. @CookiePLMonster & @Big--Mike \nI just did a note for replacing Notepad:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/features/replace-notepad.html\nPlease let me know if there are some errors or some information is missing.\n(BTW, what's the opposite command line to undo Notepad replacement?). @CookiePLMonster I can reproduce the crash.

Good job.\nIt seems to me the new behaviour is better than the old one.\nLet's remove the old behaviour and make new one as standard behaviour.. @SinghRajenM What @bahusoid pointed out is an expected behaviour but hard to implement.\nTo prevent from users' complain about unexpected side effect of the new behaviour, I will keep both old and new behaviours. So users can switch back the old one if they want. You don't need to do anything on this PR, I kept your previous one on my local branch.\nThank you for this helpful improvement.. @SinghRajenM \nIt is indeed. I've fixed locally and I will commit it this evening.\nThe modif (removal) is due to wrong judgement while reviewing the your commit for the new feature rename untitled tab. I take in charge of the fix/enhancement in this new feature.. His/her windows or Notepad++ crashes then all the backup files have gone. The remain stuffs are expletive insulting words, no other useful information.\nI've got user's report before for the same issue while windows crashes (or forced restart due to its update).\nI'll see what I can do about it (backup's backup? damn backupinception).. @chcg  No problem :)\n. @Ices-Eyes I let you update Italian translation.. @jmbockhorst  Don't worry about Appveyor, it does build on my PC too..

Please read the release news.. Keep this dialog as it is.\nI will work on it later.. @SinghRajenM \nI second what @sasumner said.. @SinghRajenM  It could be \"nice to have\", but it's not a mandatory info IMO. \nThis info could be on both tooltip of zoom - if the implementation is trivial. Otherwise let's focus our coding effort on more important feature and critical bug.. That's the correct fix. However, there are still some functions use _pluginsCommands[i]._pluginName instead _pluginInfos[i]->_moduleName (not all, but some). Could you fix them as well?\n. What's the advantage to allocate a string dynamically, whereas we can have an automatic variable here?\n. it's rather \"(64-bit x64)\"\n. It's rather (32-bit x86)\n.

Why do we need to do it here again?. The declaration of variable should be more near as possible to the first usage of variable.\n. Rather fileFullPath = buf->getFullPathName(); IMO. The big error icon makes users feel  the catasrophy is happening on Notepad++, whereas it's a small problem.\nIt's better to remove MB_ICONERROR to not scare users IMO.. OK, I didn't see it's used in another block. In this case, you're right.\nOTOH, you don't need to do generic_string fileFullPath(TEXT(\"\"));\ngeneric_string fileFullPath; will create an empty string.. true, but it's rather a sementic issue: \n+= is a concatanate operation, that's make us think there's already a string in it and we want to keep it.\nSo yes, please change it to make the intention more clear.. why such space between \"with\" and \"assume\"?\n. Problem: there are 2 &amp O\nCould you please aligned to chinese.xml, please?\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/installer/nativeLang/chinese.xml\n. @SinghRajenM I don't think last version of Notepad++ can be run under XP.. @cmeriaux It's nice to make review easier but inserting the spaces for such purpose is just pointless - these spaces will be merged into code base.

We don't need the ref of people who use the translator.\n@yusuf2526 \nYour contribution wouldn't be accepted If I knew it has been done by the automatic translator .\nYou can always do your contribution on the language you speak.\nOtherwise, if you want to to satisfy your ego, please look for somewhere-else - Notepad++ is not the project for that.. \"Contributor\" means someone who has \"contributed\" somethings.\nAutomatic translation brings bad user experience, so I would say that not only you have done nothing for the contribution but also did somethings bad to the project. \nI don't see in any case why you deserve to be named in Notepad++ project.. Rather allowWmCopydataMessages ?. Why not? But why?. The removal feature is rather for making next parsing easier.\nI would say \"isInList\" is better semantically since it's the main feature it's supposed to do.. Can use class FileDialog; instead.. Both _mightBeDragging & _dragCount should be initialized.. I would replace bRetVal by isOK.. It's too complex for a simple task.\nI suggest the following code:\nExecWait '\"$WINDIR\\explorer.exe\" \"$INSTDIR\\notepad++.exe\"'\nExec '\"$INSTDIR\\notepad++.exe\" \"$INSTDIR\\change.log\" '\nWhat do you think?. @SinghRajenM \n\nAs name suggest ExecWait waits until exe terminates.\nExecWait does not know whether npp is launched or not.\n\nYou're right about 2 points above\nAs you said in the comment:\n\nIf previous npp is configured as \"Always in multi-instance mode\", then \na. Two npp instances will be opened which is not expected \nb.

You can disable all plugins temporarily by renaming C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\plugins to something else.\n. http://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-6.7-release.html\n\"Note that all versions before Windows XP SP2 are not supported any more by Notepad++.\"\nNot sure if this means that XP SP2 itself isn't supported.\n. There is a bug here where it will input newlines in the wrong place if you don't sort the entire file. Will fix this.\n. eee7c4f is a new feature, cherry-pick it out if you don't want it.\nCurrently everything is sorted lexicographically, so an ascending sort of this:\n90\n89\n9\nis\n89\n9\n90\nI think most users would expect this result:\n9\n89\n90\nI have added logic to detect when all lines to be sorted are integers. If so, then we sort numerically and not lexicographically.\nThis could easily be extended to deal with decimal numbers as well (use std::stod instead of std::stoi), but it raises questions about how to deal with decimal point vs decimal comma, handling of spaces (i.e should we recognize \"1 234,50\" as a valid number), etc. Maybe a new option is needed for that, but there are already so many options in N++...\n. Note that I chose to let empty lines mean INT_MIN.\n. 0eca4db is also related to numeric sort (I realized after committing that it could be improved).\n. Creating a vector of ints and then sorting is a lot faster than sorting a vector of strings directly and doing the conversion to int in the sorting lambda.\nThis requires that we be able to exactly roundtrip string -> int -> string. So we can't allow empty strings to count as INT_MIN (unless we add special logic). Not a big loss if you ask me.\nI prepared a test file of 900 000 pseudorandom ints. On my computer I get these results:\nSorting before: > 10 seconds\nSorting after: 1.7 seconds\nCould probably be sped up more (it does several passes through the lines), but I'm going to stop now and only deal with eventual bugs.\n. Have fixed these things now.\nThe only manual memory management I can see is in getLine(). I don't see how it can be written without new/delete since it interfaces with Scintilla. But it's moot anyway since I have removed the function since it wasn't used.\n\nI have also fixed numeric sort so it can handle empty lines again.\n. You're right, I thought you meant that it was somehow possible to get a std::wstring directly out of Scintilla.\n. Very well, I have removed it.\n. Some methods can be marked as const, but copy() can't (or maybe it can, but infects some other methods so I didn't bother).\nThe error handling in str2clipboard has been fixed.\n. Hmm... Maybe I messed up the history on this since I wanted the changes from PR 76 (fix debug build) in this one as well. \n. @donho See #150.\n. Works fine here. Can you provide an example file? Are you running any plugins?\n. I don't suppose there is some kind of advanced Git magic which would allow this to be merged but without messing up the history (blame in particular)?\n. It's a good idea and easy to implement. But I'll wait and see what Don says, I don't want to get this PR closed because it adds too many options to the menus.\n. I'm open for suggestions, but I don't know which terms describes it better than \"lexicographic\". Maybe just \"text\"...\n. Don't know if there is an actual policy, but if someone still uses VS2010 and it can be supported by changing a single loop, why not?\n. Another idea I had was that if the user makes a rectangular selection (Alt + select), then only the selected part will be used when sorting.\nE.g if only the column with the numbers has been selected here:\na3\nb2\nc1\nThen the result of an ascending integer sort will be:\nc1\nb2\na3\n. My objections to the checkbox:\n- It is preferable to have as little state as possible in the UI. If a user selects menu option X, then Y should always happen.\n- Don's suggestion adds 8 options to the menu, xylographe's adds 6. That's not a lot of options saved.\n- Users might not understand that clicking \"Sort Descending\" just changes the setting. They might think it will actually perform a sort.\n- If you are in descending mode and want to sort ascending, then you have to first deselect descending, then open the menu again and select the sort option you want. Too many clicks.\n\nThe main problem I have with Don's suggestion is that it repeats \"Sort Lines\" so many times. I think we should either remove one level of menus:\n\nOr we should have sort lines directly under Edit:\n\n. Maybe, if we are married to having \"operations\" in the Edit menu. The problem is that it doesn't make sense in English:\nSort Operations - Lexicographically, Ascending\nRead it out loud and compare with:\nSort Lines - Lexicographically, Ascending\nIf we use \"Sort Operations\" then we have put the same verb first in all options, either\nSort Operations - Sort Lexicographically, or\nSort Operations - Sort Lines Lexicographically etc.\nAnnoying repetition.\n. Ok, see latest commit.\n. I guess this is all a bit moot now that the PR has been merged, but I personally find it highly unintuitive to use menu options like this (as a user). I think I've only ever seen anything like it once before (i.e a menu checkbox which only refers to something in its own menu), and that is the \"Begin/End Select\" feature in N++ (coincidentally, it was I who coded that and now realize that it would be better if it was split into \"Begin Select\" and \"End Select\").\n. @Rikk Two radio buttons? But what does the second one signify? Is \"Textually (lexicographically)\" an action (\"it sorts\") or an option (\"it affects later actions\")?\nAnd going into settings for sorting? No way! Talk about being hard to find.\nI think if cleaning up the menus is the goal (and it is a worthy one), then we should have a single command in the menu called \"Sort\" which pops up a modal dialog. The dialog should have two comboboxes (one for ascending/descending, and another for type of sort) and OK/Cancel buttons.\n@ariccio I think all editions of VS include a profiler now (at least the free Community Edition does). That's what I used to guide the development of the sorting improvements.\n. > What is hard to understand?\nWhat does the second radio button mean? In your screenshot, are Textually/Numerically all settings? If not, why is there a radio button in front of them? To avoid confusion, this is the one I can't figure out:\n\nFrom what I understand, this radio button is what separates your idea from that of @MAPJe71 / @xylographe from two days ago.\n. Agree that a \"No to all\" button would be best, but due to the painstaking work which would be required just to get another button (creating a special dialog and mimicking the behavior of Windows' own message boxes), I'm not going to be the one implementing that. Until then I think this could be considered a \"power-user feature\".\nI don't think it's too dangerous. Lots of programs have this.\n. Ok, I think in that case it's best to close this PR.\n. Users sometimes use the context menu to open hundreds of files at once. This requires special logic in NppShell since a command can only be 2048 or 32768 characters long (depending on Windows version). Does the registry solution also deal with this?\n. The PDB is committed for every release, and it is useful if someone sends a dump file.\n. @Neamar just a consequence of Github's way of displaying tabs. It would look okay in Visual Studio.\n. Compile: probably not without a lot of work since it has been written with Windows in mind.\nRun: possibly, try WINE on Linux (http://bur.st/~gunny/winehowto.html) and similar solutions on other platforms (if they exist).\n. I think a screenshot would be good. I tried this PR the last time it was suggested, but I couldn't see any changes.\n. See #311.\n. 1) Don't actually know, I just imitated some other header.\n2) I generally only use structs like \"dumb groupings of variables\" like you would in straight C. Here we want RAII logic in the constructor/destructor, so no struct even though it is possible.\n3) Changed it to static, good catch.\n. > but using a  struct  doesn't prevent RAII behavior\nI know. What I mean is that I only want structs as dumb groupings of variables. Anything else gets to be a class. It's akin to Hungarian notation or prefixing member variables with \"m_\".\n. @DmFedorov The patch was pulled out of 6.7.9 due to compatibility issues with WinXP, so it can't very well be the cause of those problems! (It will be in the next version.) Number one is due to #116, don't know about the other one. Maybe start a new issue?\n. I am generally in favor of merging PRs like these.\n. The guy in the video is using some other program (maybe he says which one in the beginning). N++ doesn't have those advanced features, so when you type in \"background-image\" you won't get a file dialog where you can choose a background image file. You will have to type the name of the file manually.\nTake an image, rename it to \"bg.jpg\" and place it in some folder. Copy the below HTML code and place it in a file called \"test.html\" in the same folder that you blaced bg.jpg. If you open test.html in a browser you should get a background image.\n``` html\n\n\n\nbody {\n    background-image: url(bg.jpg)\n}\n\n\n\nSome text. A link\n\n\n```\n. I figured out the program - it's called DreamWeaver.\nOne more thing out of the way.\nThanks for specifying about the notepad++, I shall surely try it out.\n\nNow onto problem 2.\nAs I've said before, this site (that is not mine) wants me to edit a site using CSS for this background image I want, but how do I connect it to the CSS, especially since I don't have the code for the site that tells me to do this?\n\nI pointed to the site link above because I want to ask...Is that all I have to do to connect this site?\n\nEither way, I am so very relieved someone is trying to help me. A thousand thanks coming from me to you.\n. (4hrs later)\n*\nHey it worked! Now to only apply it to the page somehow and I'll be set. Thank you a lot there.\n. I talked with one of the heads of the site on live chat and I got right on track. Thank you for your help, though, I really needed that.\nI'll take my leave now.\nOnce again, thank you.\n. @donho Which version of Visual Studio is used to compile the release version? I'm able to reproduce this issue with 6.7.8.2 from the website, but when compiling the same tag on my own computer (VS 2013 Update 4), it disappears.\n. Possibly, the project owner (Don) needs to get involved.\n. @donho What is the error message? Just cloned my repo from scratch, switched to this branch and built the program. No errors.\n. Use other PR.\n. #187, see comment by @Cyrillev91 above. That PR seems to fix more fundamental issues and not just this particular case with the grave accent.\n. I've noticed this issue myself.  To add a little to it, if you close the file (just the file, not Notepad++) it then asks you if you'd like to save it.  Clicking yes will save it and then the next time you open and edit the file, it will then allow you to save.\nThis is after the file won't save when clicking Save (as mentioned in the post above.)\n. It uses the new dialog for Open, the old one for Save/Save as.\nI tried to replace the old one last month but failed. There is some magic logic (I think the comment in the code is \"this line is cursed, don't touch it!\" or something similar) which makes it possible for N++ to change the file extension combo in the save dialog, I couldn't get it working with the new dialog.\n. Alright, no problem.\n. > The text blocks are the Notepad++ 'Easter eggs'.\n\nI haven't read them all, but which do you find offending?\n\nI don't feel fancy enough to copy/paste myself to death in an effort to point out each and every bit of questionable text... let us just say that sexism, racism, extremism (to find a \"good\" way around that one \"necrophilia\" quote) and, to some extent, political agenda has no place in either a binary nor source code - and all of that is to be found in these, as you call 'em, \"Easter Eggs\". Apart from that, some of the \"quotes\" are stepping over boundaries by quite a stretch; I know more than just one forum where you would actually enjoy a life-time ban for posting such crap (and for good reason) - let alone \"posting\" the whole book of idiocies.\nI think it is a overly daring act to feed these brainfarts onto others hard drives because of the plain nature of the trojan text. Source or binary is not IRC, or some underground message board, where lo-lives tend to gather to exchange \"great thoughts\" like that with each other. Especially the \"eat kids\" line can be seen as borderline pedophilia ... I don't think that someone would want to run into a false accusation because some idiot hid such text in his binary.\nThe good thing might be that this now made me aware that it might be a insanely great idea to comb through the executables of 3rd parties with the finest comb to weed out \"inferior products\" built by clowns.\nJust to get it straight: I personally don't take any offense in any of the text, I just think that it is absolutely unacceptable to ship something like this to the great public, no matter how hidden it is. Speaking just for myself (and I actually used NP++ for YEARS on end) ... to me Don just flushed his reputation and credibility down the toilet without a single chance to regain it ever.\n\nDebug symbols in a release binary can actually be very helpful.\n\nWell, I use debug builds for internal testing when trying to replicate bugs to find out where stuff went wrong more easily but we don't ship release versions (closed source software) as a debug build or with debug symbols as it only adds \"bloat\", and it's really not helpful to your average user anyway.\nThe only advantage you get is that Windows will happily pull a snippet into the associated \"Application Crash\" event entry instead of just noting down that \"processname\" has crashed.\nKeep in mind that even Microsoft is offering the debug symbols as an option, they don't come per default with Windows or Office or (continue list at will).\n. Q: what do feminists, muslims and Germans all have in common?\nA: they are all boycotting Notepad++.\n. To bad for you that I'm not German.\n. I was fooled by the humorless demeanor.\n. Present version scintilla(x>3.5.3) accepts a font name only in utf-8.\nBut now npp font names are in CP_ACP.\n\nOn Windows GDI, assume font names are encoded in UTF-8.\n\nhttp://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaHistory.html\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/bugs/1684/\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scintilla-interest/ti3PE4LDMNs/discussion\n.

I really appreciate your hard work. \n. @milipili fixed.\n. @Croydon Anti-aliasing is accomplished by blurring text, which does not agree with every combination of eye and screen.\n@koogler See @Yaron10's comment in #116 for a workaround. The fundamental issue is fixed in #311 which should hopefully be merged in the next release.\n. yea wondering why json files aren't colored :'(\n. Please see if the problem remains even if you turn off all plugins (rename C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\plugins to something else temporarily). The vast majority of issues like these are caused by plugins.\n. @milipili It's just the principle of least privilege. The N++ source is on the order of 4000 times bigger than the nppcopy program (122 000 lines vs 31 lines; counted using the naive method). If you accept that\n- it's easier to reason about 31 lines of code than 122 000 lines, and\n- you want as little code as possible running under administrator mode\nthen surely the choice is clear...?\nEach of those 122 000 lines can potentially be executed when N++ is run, and each contains a potential bug. That bug's impact is potentially much greater when running as admin. I get that you propose to add special checks as soon as is possible in WinMain() when running under this new mode, but just how sure are you that the command-line parser (which, literally, does pointer arithmetic) is bug-free?\n. Yes it is still happening :(\nThe bug: the tabs that are opened get lost\nnever happened before using npp.6.7.9.1.Installer.exe\nI had this bug when I updated to v7.3.3 portable then I downgraded to v6.8.8 portable and I had the same bug.\nit happens in 2 situations:\n1- when I open np++ as administrator while it is opened as normal user, but I couldn t reproduce this manually !\n2- when I format (I use the portable version so the AppData is not used and temp files are saved in my portable folder), sometimes when I format (recover full pc image) I lose the tabs too.\nI hope we can catch this mouse :)\nbut thanks to God at less files are not lost you can reopen them from Appdata or you portable folder if you configured notpad++ to be portable.... Seems to work for me. Are you running any plugins? Try renaming C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\plugins to something else temporarily, restarting N++ and seeing if the problem still remains.\n. @Yaron10 After line 2871 in FindReplaceDlg.cpp, add the following:\nc++\nelse if (HIWORD(wParam) == EN_SETFOCUS)\n{\n    ::PostMessage(::GetDlgItem(_hSelf, IDC_INCFINDTEXT), EM_SETSEL, 0, -1);\n    break;\n}\n. > My tests show that neither alt-tab or change of program by mouse keep the Find dialog in focus.\nI am sometimes able to get it focus on Scintilla after switching with the mouse. Sometimes it goes to the Find dialog. This leads me to believe that this is a pure bug.\n\nAlso, is the OP requested action the most usable design?\n\nYes, of course ;) Switching back and forth between programs using Alt-Tab should not upset the program state (not by default, anyway). Imagine working in Excel and finding that Alt-Tab caused Excel to jump to another cell.\n. Another data point: Visual Studio preserves focus on the Find window.\nTBH it doesn't matter so much for me what happens in the official N++ version, since I will simply change the behavior in my own fork (if I only knew how!).\n. The quick and dirty solution is to replace this piece in the big switch (obviously only works with the find and replace dialog):\nc++\ncase WM_ACTIVATE :\n    _pEditView->getFocus();\n    return TRUE;\nwith:\nc++\ncase WM_ACTIVATE:\n{\n    if (_findReplaceDlg.isVisible())\n    {\n        _findReplaceDlg.getFocus();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        _pEditView->getFocus();\n    }\n    return TRUE;\n}\nI can see by tracing that if you don't set the focus somewhere manually on WM_ACTIVATE, no window at all will have focus when you Alt-Tab back into N++. Does Windows really expect you to manage this yourself? I assumed that it did the obvious thing, unless the program specifically overrides it.\n. Let us continue this disucssion in #393 where there is some code along @milipili's lines, it seems to work okay.\n. Case 1 does not work perfectly. Even though focus is correct, the main window looks like it's selected\n\nShould look like this:\n\n. hello, i can comfirm, i'im using win10 official release and there is no problem, it was the old version of dspell which was crashing when closing notepadd++ and not related to win10. or there is another bug ? i'm not aware of that.\ni use latest DSpellCheck 1.2.14.2\n.

Please dont merge the first one, merge the second: d73af25 (the one with a comment)\n. eu fiz o update, mas fiz a nivel local e gra\u00e7as ao xylographe entendi o que eram esses &. o que aconteceu \u00e9 que no website do notepad++ eu nao entendi o que eram, ent\u00e3o entendi como texto a mais.\nisso est\u00e1 corrigido na minha vers\u00e3o local, voltei a adcionar os &amps quando finalmente percebi para que serviam. s\u00f3 ainda nao tinha dito nada porque nao tinha tempo.\nd\u00e1 para fazer o upload do meu arquivo local ou tem de ser feito tudo de novo?\nreparei tamb\u00e9m que o meu ficheiro fica com mais atalhos que o XML brasileiro. eu apenas coloquei os que estavam dantes, por predefini\u00e7\u00e3o e penso que adicionei o de sair.\nora v\u00ea l\u00e1 se j\u00e1 est\u00e1 como deveria?\n\n. milipili I messed up the xml file due to I didn't knew what was the &\nso, I am talking to rikk, to see if I corrected the problem, now that I know what are the & keys, just that.\nmy last reply says:\nI made de update, but at a local level, and thanks to xylograph I could understand what are the & and what they do to the program. I thought, when I did the update to the xml file, that & was some text that didnt belong to the xml file.\n this is corrected on my local xml file, as you can see through the screenshot. \nnow I want to know if I can erase the past xml files, and re-upload the correct (with the key &), to make it less confuse.\nI noticed also that my xml file has more alt shortcuts than the brazilian version and I also added the shortcut \"sair\" (close), since the brazilian xml also has it.\nthat was what i said, but here I put more text than what I actually said on my mother language reply.\nthe image is my local xml file with the &'s.\n. You have probably created the SUBST drives as user X but are running N++ as user Y.\nSee e.g http://superuser.com/questions/614721/subst-drive-invisible-in-non-admin-processes\n. yes, it is. it's the one I am using already on my local NP++. I had a few trouble on my last request, since I didnt understood what are the \"&\". this new one has all of them, I revised it with the older portuguese.xml, added the \"&\" again, keeping the changes I made to it. I hope this one is ok.\nan observation: I found some english text on my notepad++, but when I go search it on the xml file, using ctrl+f (search box) I cant find those words I see at NP++. Since I made just only an update to some words, 'cause, well, honestly, the translation was crap, making simple things a hell of a mess...so I re-translated the words using the english .xml version only when I could not understand the word that was translated on the POR version. as last, I think portuguese xml could be missing more words than the one I describde. that would require a new brand translation or a fully revision, comparing the eng with the por version. I am sorry, but I can't have time to do that, I barely had time to read all the POR xml file, so I could not compare eng with por translations.\n. Discussed in #334\n. It seems that the problem is the Hex-Editor. Some days ago I also met this issue.\n. I thought about this when I made the latest changes to the sorting code a few months back. The problem is that you can't reliably detect automatically if the user wants an ordinal sort or something else, so you'll have to add an option for every language. Some languages, like Swedish, will require two options. This greatly increases GUI complexity.\n. Added options to copy with or without line numbers in #150 / #68, but it was decided that it should always be without numbers by @donho. Maybe this decision needs to be reconsidered.\n. How about this one ? It's very simple, you just need to press Ctrl+Alt+C\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-colorpicker/\n. I'm aware, I use them at 8, however, it sometimes only prints 3 characters on the screen, for no apparent reason.\n. Could you please implement this feature? It's extremly valuable in terms of analysing log files in real time.\n. Gladly, However thank you for pointing out the issue. Guess Im not the only one.\n. This is partially available in Notepad++. See the available options in the \"Edit -> Line operations -> Sort...\" menu.\nIf you want to sort by column you will have select the column by holding down the Alt key and doing a selection with the mouse. (This means that you can only sort by one key.)\n. isn't that the document switcher?\nit's activated by scrolling up or down while holding down RMB, or by pressing tab while holding down ctrl\nyou can disable it under preferences > misc. if you don't want to use it\n.

There's a setting for this, Settings -> Preferences -> Misc -> Treat backslash as escape character for SQL.\n. Thanks vlakoff!\n. version: 6.9 theme: Obsidian and the other themes\n. In default style no issue but in other styles there are\n. @veepee78 Thanks. My issue was solved with your help.\n. From my knowledge of NPP, either string is highlighted every time it's used or it's never highlighted. It's a quick change, but you have to pick one or the other.\n. Oops, the .nfo file can be useful for debugging crash Notepad Plus Plus.\nFFD_projet_test-NFO.zip\n. It's not just python modules.  I've had UTF-8 text files do the same thing, and depending on the bytes misinterpretted this can cause a crash + complete file loss.\n\n. Periodic backups are off.\nEven small files--less than 100 lines--using multi-byte encodings will occasionally behave this way.\n. ^ removing good feature like Google. I'm experiencing the same issue on Windows 7 x64. neither manually adding the program to the open with menu nor changing the default programs works. Notepad++ x64 simply does not show up.\n. if someone could send me in the right direction to look at the specific code where the changes need to be done, I wouldn't mind working on it myself;  if not I am sure it would be much easier for whoever built the scroll functions to make the changes. Discovered the same issue when enabling git GUI on the folder. The issue must be in the configuration of my network.. It does not work for me on Notepad++ v7.3.2. The general form of a subroutine definition in Perl programming language is :\nsub subroutine_name{\n   body of the subroutine\n}\nnot \nsub subroutine_name() {\n   body of the subroutine\n}\nand the parser does not recognize this syntax. In previous versions it worked :(\nThanks.. Hi,\nI've just installed the 7.4.1 version from the website and it still does not work for me. \nTo be sure, i have also downloaded the last \"FunctionList.xml\" from the GitHub repository. I have exactly the same on my PC (\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\functionList.xml\")\nYou can see the problem here. The PERL functions are still not recognized but in old versions of Notepad++ it worked perfectly :(\nDo i have to do something else ? Is the right \"FunctionList.xml\" file on another repository ?\nThanks.\nI'm sorry to bother you.... Reproducible steps:\n\nCopy the code from the linked example (or from the following shorter code example and paste it in a .sh file (make sure to change all leading spaces to tabs after you paste it).\n\nbash /dev/fd/10 10<<-'SES'\n\u21e8   # Setup LAMP environment and mod_rewrite:\n\u21e8   \u21e8   cat <<EMR > ~/tiesto\n\u21e8   \u21e8   text...\n\u21e8   \u21e8   EMR\nSES\nNote: Where there is an arrow - There should be a leading tab. No leading spaces are allowed.\n\nCopy and paste the edited code into your bash terminal and execute it by pressing enter (return).\n\nThe outcome should be a file named tiesto created in your home folder containing all content nested inside the cat heredoc (in this case, the string \"text\").\nAs I wrote in the thread the execution breaks and I get:\n\nwarning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted EMR'). I expect Notepad++ not to add any hidden characters besides tabulations orLF` (assuming something extra might be added). If something extra is added this is problematic and might break execution of the heredoc in Bash (I can't determine if that's the case and hence emphasized it's possible to do with Notepad++ but I don't strictly determine anything).. I use Unix EOLs (LF) if that's you mean, but what you mention might be different?. Yes, but I assumed there are other things which aren't necessarily seen there? For example, I know that the encoding is a trait that isn't shown there and assumed some \"anti-Unix\" traits might cause the problem I have.. Actually it does seem to me as a bug in Notepadd++ and that NP++ doesn't interpret the heredocs right and doesn't delimit them correctly and it might effect how to data is pasted in the Unix shell itself (I checked that in two different Unix systems):\n\n\n. If you use the <<- operator it should remove all leading tabs (I lead only with tabs). There is no problem enclosing it with quotes as it just prevents var substitution.\nI don't have a Linux GUI here, in Nano it all looks the same (white text).\nThe redirect is usually putted as part of the opener, not the delimiter.. I know what it is and by \"interpret\" I meant to why it is represented in it behind the scenes: From the uniform coloring in the image above something seems not right. I've expanded on Unix stackExchange (please read the update there if you haven't already).\n\n. @dail8859 , I didn't change the link back and forth: At the start I pasted two questions (in Unix SE and AskUbuntu SE) and the question on AskUbuntu was deleted because there's no reason to assume this problem is particular to Ubuntu. I have no plans to further change this.\nN++ Debug info:\nNotepad++ v7.3.3   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Mar  8 2017 - 03:37:37\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10 (64-bit)\nPlugins : mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll PluginManager.dll\nYes, because the native heredocument graphics of Notepad++ are ugly, I changed them to something which is but less ugly (me and another user agreed it would be best to totally remove the heredoc styling for Notepad++ because it's useless).\nAnyway, the code I used to reproduce the problem in my systems is the one I pasted in comment 3. I just copied it from N++ (when all leads are tabulation based) and executed in Bash with the Return (Enter) key. I did nothing else to get the reported error.. The only indication as I see it (and I don't strictly determine anything) is the coloring issue I described which I assumed might be associated with byte change in the file. Now, after the answer in Unix SE by derobert, it does seem flaws of pasting in the current release of the relevant terminal emulator is the problem. . I don't want to change anything in Scintilla, rather I just want their heredoc styling not to be implemented to my Notepad++. I would appreciate any solution you might have. It would be a most honored contribution.. I'm new to programming and don't have the knowledge to use hex editors at the moment though might learn basic usage soon. Anyway, When I paste it to a Windows Notepad .txt document there are no CR chars, so copy/paste isn't the cause. I don't use X11 or a Virtual machine. The last other option is the terminal emulator of CMD/WSL.. Do you mean that neither 32 nor x64 release have now a plugin manager \nthe offical website said this but i dont agree cuz i really need a plugin manager\n\"\nYou may notice that Plugin Manager plugin has been removed from the official distribution.

I believe they aren't. I don't have the time to go in depth of this now but I could say this: The file bash.bashrc sits in the same directory of /etc in Linux and yet that files does have, seemingly, the .sh coloring; A similar initiation for crontab could do well (maybe it's just a reference needed to be added to some list?).. Similar issue as described here\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/42339955/how-to-force-notepad-to-open-files-only-in-utf-8. Maybe I had to add a description of the problem because you understood the opposite. I thought it was obvious but I realize that it may not be clear to everyone.\nmd5 is a PHP keyword and for this reason should appear in blue also in the first case since the '.' is only for concatenation and should not have any influence on it (At least I think so).. I do not know where you have pulled out $this->md5 that does not have anything to do with what I am saying here:\n```\n<?php\n$this->bar.md5() // md5 should be blue but it does not!!\n$this->bar. md5()\n$this->bar .md5()\n```\nThey are the same thing but in first example md5 does not appear blue while it should because '.' is only for concatenation.\nBug: Keywords concatenated to members are not highlighted.. Thanks. Hope Notepad++ updates to the newer version.. Recently v7.5.7 was released, but this patch wasn't merged? Why?. Why is this still not fixed?. Let's hope @donho accepts @adipiciu's patch (if it's that easy).. To @donho et al., I realize this isn't marked as Accepted, but I used this simple request as a way to get familiar with the NPP dev environment.

You may try the plugin NppMenuSearch. This is exactly what you need\n. Don't fight but code and PR !\n. Hello guys,\nI also noticed the problem sometimes ago.\nI did some test and my conclusions are : \nscintilla python lexers \n- doesn't support indentation with tabs.\n- every line indented with 1 space will be attached on fold level 1\n- every line indented with 2 spaces will be attached on fold level 2\n- every line indented with n spaces will be attached on fold level n\nSo if your python code uses a 4 spaces tabulation, the first level level of indentation will be associated with the fold level 5.\n@HactarCE your quick-and-dirty solution wouldn't be divide the \"FoldLevel\" by \"tab size\"\n ....\n. Right click on one of the result line, copy and paste in a new buffer. You will get the raw line.\nThis is different than : click on the result buffer, select all, copy and paste in a new buffer.\nWhat do you think of this tips ?\n. What about using grep (from cygwin installation) through npp exec plugin \n. You may read that : \nhttp://superuser.com/questions/132797/disable-auto-update-in-notepad\n. @donho \nOk I understand.

Is it possible ?\nRight now, I used vcvarsall.bat without option. It seems that npp is actually x64 with platform x64 but scintilla doesn't not seems to be x64.\nIs the build procedure correct ? I means, scintilla makefile needn't an option ? -arch:IA32 will be automatically ignored ?\nThanks for the help\n. @donho As I commit with --amend option, the PR is automatically updated. I supposed your are spammed with my tests. So I close it, and will submit against when it works.\nIn another side, have you read the @chcg  comment ? Will you fix it in another ticket ?\n. It's seems that AppVeyor has serious trouble with their storage. Cache management and artifacts storage throws exceptions\n. Do you mean remove totally boost from NPP ?\n. I think Appveyor must be in the final configuration. If you deliver Npp with Boost support, AppVeyor must build with Boost support.\nIn that way, appveyor could be our official builder, and deliver automatically \"official version\" and \"nightly build version\"\n@chcg may found the solution, see his comments in 5a5582b97286678cce7a98eb0810efea38607d7e \n. Ok, nevermind for the official builder.\nWhat about \"nightly build version\" non signed ? Are you interested ?\n. Ok, we keep boost.\nIf people need last snapshot, it can be a nightmare to build. We are developper, so its easy for use to compile. \nThere are so much version of visual studio (community, enterprise, 2012 2013 2015) ... People don't have to official version of npp.\nIt's so easy for appVeyor to deliver the nightly build.\n. fixed in #2079\n. Hello\nI confirm, I fixed this problem in #1942  #1943 \n@NN---  Can you close it ?\n. can you report the \"debug information\" ?\nYou may confirm your bug without any plugins\n. @donho @milipili you did 'git commit --amend' but there was nothing to commit. You did no changes on the initial PR but a rebase.\nAm I wrong ?\nThat's why the author is not changed by github. Il my PR, you added some changes. That's why github changed the author even if the original author was preserved by git commit --amend command\n. Hello,\nI found the solution few years ago. Now, i always use it.\nHere is the solution :\n- mark a word with \"search/mark all/using 1st style\"\n- navigate forward or backward with the function \"search/Jump Up/1st style\" of \"search/jump down/1st style\"\nI mapped the function \"mark all/n style\", \"jump up\" and \"jump down\" to different shortcut. It's perfect.\n. @donho arrrf too bad\nIt's due to your  commit amend.\nYou should have used github website to integrate my ticket. Then you do a git pull in your local repository \n. I think you \"commit amend\" some changes on my commit because I never modified files \n- .gitignore  (ignore +PowerEditor/installer/zipped.package.release64/)\n-  PowerEditor/installer/packageAll.bat (sign release 64 binaries file)\nPlus, my PR was named \"Appveyor artifacts debug and release\", now your commit is named \"Appveyor artifacts debug and release for x86 & x64\". This may be the main reason why github ignore me as an author\n. @donho  @milipili \nThe problem may appeared during the command \"git rebase -i\". \nGit should have proposed to you two lines (my commit and your commit). You may have told him to squash my commit into yours \nFor the record, Rebase propose different command : \n```\nCommands:\np, pick = use commit\nr, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message\ne, edit = use commit, but stop for amending\ns, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit\nf, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message\n\n```\n. It's asked with so much kindness .....\nWhat about contributing yourself ...\n.

Thanks, but change the PR title is not enough. Your commit title hasn't changed. Here is some helps to do that : https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/\n. @donho  c'est pas possible quand meme !\nDeux fonctions sont traduites de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on et en plus la traduction n'explique pas ce que fait la commande ! \n \n\nIdem pour tous les autres \nPeut tu m'expliquer en quoi ce commit n'apporte rien ?\nJ'ai l'impression que tu t'es bloqu\u00e9 sur les 3 pauvres lignes qui contiennent 20 tabulation que j'ai corrig\u00e9.\n. @donho I got your point. Menus are clear and \"Recherche le suivant\" is not necessary. You are right.\nMy point is :  \"Recherche le suivant\" is mandatory in the Shortcut Mapper. As my screenshot shows, it's very confusing\n\nMore generally, a translationcan't rely on a sub-menu translation or you'll have a problem in the shortcut mapper.\nSo can you consider my point of view and reopen the ticket ?\nThanks\n. @donho so you are OK that I add in shortcutMapper.cpp some check to prepend the submenu ID to the translate ID  ?\n. @donho \nYou don't want to complicate the \"shortcut mapper\" code.\nYou don't want redundant translation with a sub-menu translation.\nSo you don't care that Shortcut Mapper\" GUI prompt an incomprehensible message.\nThere are some contradiction in what you says and what is implemented. Sometime you repeat the sub-menu message, some time you don't\n\"mark all\"/\"Using 1st style\"\n\"mark all\"/\"Using 2st style\"\n\"unmark all\"/\"clear 1st style\"\n\"unmark all\"/\"clear 2st style\"\n\"jump up\"/\"1st style\"\n\"jump up\"/\"2st style\"\n\"jump down\"/\"1st style\"\n\"jump down\"/\"2st style\"\n\"EOL Conversion\"/\"convert ....\"\n\"close more\"/\"close but ....\"\n\"project\"/\"project pannel ....3\nI suggest you to make every body happy ( user of the GUI, user of the Shortcut Mapper, Developer of Shortcut mapper) : \nwrite a translation that doesn't rely on a sub-menu message\nSo please accept my PR\n. @donho  for the record, you can review multiple commit easily using git diff  with commit option\n\ngit diff [--options]  [--] [\u2026\u200b]\nThis form is to view the changes you have in your working tree relative to the named . You can use HEAD to compare it with the latest commit, or a branch name to compare with the tip of a different branch.\n\nso you just have to check out the sha1 of the PR and do git diff or git difftool to use a diff front end (my prefered is beyond compare)\n\ngit checkout PR_sha1\ngit difftool master\n. You may amend your 3 commites.\n\nGit commit -a --amend\n.

Very nice feature. Thanks for that.\nYou should also add it to the \"replace\" panel.\n. @MojaveWastelander\nmoreover, if you are writing something to search in the replace panel, then you select the find panel, quick find functionality is not triggered.\nJust a git recommendation, you should keep your master branch same as upstream/master. You should develop  \"quick find functionality\" in a separate branch. It will be easy to integrate, rebase or whatever\n. please squash all yours commits.\ngit feth --all\ngit rebase -i upstream/master\nthen change \"pick\" command to \"squash\" command on each commits\nOnce it's ok, push with force option.

For me, nothing to update.\nYou must be patient before being integrated\n. commands is git rebase -i HEAD~6 ( 6 means the number of commit to rebase)\nThen use squash option instead of pick\n\nSee the helps here : \nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits\n. Hello, I tested with the nightlibuid\n1553095 is OK\n966ef61 is KO. Bookmark are always affected.\nLike I said before, you should also add \"quick search\" in the replace panel.\n. Hello,\nI did more tests to confirm the problem : \nIf \"Mark/Bookmark line\" is enable in the Mark panel, the Quick find function in \"Find\" panel always affect the existing bookmark.\nIf \"Mark/Bookmark line\" is disable in the Mark panel, bookmark are not affected however, bookmarked words always loose their mark color. For me It's a problem. I think that \"quick find\" should use another color than bookmark. \nAs a good example, \"Incremental Search\" (available in \"search\" menu) do something similar than \"quick find\" but use a different Scintilla Color. So it doesn't perturbate \"Mark\" and \"bookmark\" function\nScintilla allows you to define multiple style\nHere is style used by Npp:\n```\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE 31\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE_SMART 29\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE_INC 28\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_TAGMATCH 27\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_TAGATTR 26\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE_EXT1 25\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE_EXT2 24\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE_EXT3 23\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE_EXT4 22\ndefine SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE_EXT5 21\n```\nYou may create a new one, or use the icnremental style (SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE_INC)\nhttp://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html#SCI_INDICSETSTYLE\nAnother problem, \"Quick find\" follows the direction configured. I think it should process the complete document.\n. @MojaveWastelander What you've done is very nice. Thanks a lot.\nWhat about adding in the mark panel the similar function \"quick mark\" ? Is it possible ?\nOnce again, thanks.\n. @MojaveWastelander here is another problem.\nWhen \"quick find\" is enable, the auto-fill of search field with the selected word is broken. Do you confirm ?\n. @MojaveWastelander here is another problem concerning Smart Highlighting.\nStart from a fresh Notepad++\nSelect a word.\nCheck that SmartHighlighting works :  it highlights all similar words\nOpen find panel\nDo a quick find\nclose find panel\nTry again the Smart Highlighting. It should'nt works anymore until Npp restart.\nDo you confirm ?\n. hello @MojaveWastelander \nAnother issue with the last version\nWhen quick search is selected but panel is closed, the function Find volatile next is broken. \"Find volatile next\" finds the first occurence of the selected word.\nSame issue with find volatile previous, find next and find previous\nDo you confirm the issue ?\nThanks\n. It's validated here. Thanks a lot\nI wish you a good week-end\n. Hello,\nwhat is your last commit (merge branch ....)\nYou should remove it with 'git rebase -i' command\n. @donho the feature incremental search that already exist is useless. It's far beyond the classical search search due the missing options (search mode option,  whole word only option ...)\nIt should me decommissioned and replaced by the one developped by @MojaveWastelander  or something available in the find and replace GUI.\nMoreover, an incremental mode is very useful in Regular Expression mode. It allows us to validate the regular expression interactively before doing a replace.\n. @SinghRajenM  I can't reproduce it.\n.

It can't due to code certification.\nappVeyor doesn't compile with boost support.\nI hope it helps you\n. I'd like also to have the git version to identify each version available (in case of people uses a nigthly build)\nGit offer a command to do that :  git describe\n```\n[21:42:41] christophe@Christophe-PC /cygdrive/d/dev/notepad-plus-plus  master\n: git describe --tags --long\nv7-36-g4fec265\n```\n=> My  repository HEAD is on version 7, 36 commits since tags, sha1 = 4fec265\n.

It's a possibility.\nThis script would be executed just before the installer.\nLet's see what does @donho wants.\n. @donho validate_native_lang.py do a xml validation (with parse function) then it check that a language file contains every translation found in english.xml\n. @donho see line 44 \n\ntree = ET.parse(path)\n\nParsing exception are catched and printed out.

    "pnedev": "Hi dail8859,\nThat is a well done patch but I think it is actually uniting two different functions.\nThe idea behind line wrap is to be able to see the text without the need to horizontally scroll.\nThe idea behind vertical line is to be notified when you make too long lines that will probably not be viewed well on other editors/hardware.\nI have the following question:\nIf I use your change and set vertical line at 100 but my window width is enough for only 80 columns will my text wrap at column 100 making it necessary to scroll horizontally to see the text?\nI know that if I disable the vertical line it will be OK but anyway, it's not that convenient.\nIf the line wrap occurs at the smaller column number between vertical line and the window width that will be better.\nBR,\nPavel\n. Hi again,\nThanks for the explanation.\nWhat you have implemented is a good idea for new functionality - split line. If you use the vertical line as such then you change its purpose. Now it is simply a mark showing that your line is becoming way too long and you (manually) need to split it on several lines so your text is easily readable even in other editors (that might not have line wrap/split mode). Different coding styles usually have maximum line length requirement - this is where vertical line comes in handy.\nRegards,\nPavel\n. According to MSDN GetTickCount64 is supported from Vista onward (that excludes XP I think).\nCan't we use GetTickCount? It's counter is DWORD size  = 49.7 days since the system started.\nI haven't checked what you are using GetTickCount64 for so I'm not sure GetTickCount is a viable replacement.\n. +1 for static analysis\n. @donho and @milipili , I made that change because of a user request when N++ was still on SourceForge. The issue the guy had was that he was performing FindInFiles on remote machine (network share) and if there were problems with the network connection the find operation stalled without showing anything. That is because N++ was trying to make the list of the remote files to search and it was waiting for the network timeout but during this search step N++ doesn't show anything (looks like app hang to the user). Only after the list is created the actual search progress appears.\n@milipili , The idea is not to show the actual remote files list creation progress - no percentage is shown during this step. During this step the progress window only gives information on the remote directory being checked for files to search (which is the only information the user actually gets about the search status) and it also gives the user a chance to cancel the find operation during this stage (which might be very time consuming if there are network problems).\nThis is to justify the need from this patch, It's up to you guys to decide whether it's worth merging.\n. @milipili, Are all plugins checked for validity and how is that accomplished if new plugins appear?\nWouldn't it be better to remove this check altogether? After all, the Plugin Manager shows the plugin stability when the user wants to install it. Also as it is now, the MultiClipboard plugin is considered to be unstable but it is actually working just fine. And there is no info why is it flagged as invalid.\n. PR https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/2752 fixes this issue.. Hi,\nI have modified the Find In Files progress that way.\n@milipili, that is not a bug, at least I'm not considering it to be one.\n@vlakoff, the progress is made to be always on top because otherwise, due to the Find In Files implementation if you click on the main N++ window the progress will be hidden and this is highly undesirable. I seriously doubt that somebody would run Find In Files operation and start watching a movie at the same time. Besides you can always move the progress aside.\nAnyway, unless Find In Files implementation in N++ is totally changed this is the lesser evil IMO.\nAbout the focus, I thought that it would be helpful to the user to show and focus on N++ window on Find In Files completion as a notification and automatic displaying of the results. Otherwise one would constantly need to manually check if the search is ready or not. Perhaps it is a matter of preference.\nThanks for the feedback!\n. @vlakoff, as I said it is a matter of preference and I respect your personal opinion, thanks for sharing it :)\n@MAPJe71, your proposal sounds great, thanks!\nI'm not sure I'll have time soon to work on this though...\n. > also is there a way to get the snippet/template functionality of sublime?\nThere are several snippet plugins out there, have you tried one of those? Use Plugin Manager to find them.\n\nis there a way to get shift + arrow key to do the multi cursor (i know with npp we can use alt drag, i was just wondering if there was keyboard functionality)\n\nAlt + Shift + Arrow does the thing for me. You can check Settings -> Shortcut Mapper for available shortcuts.\n\njump to matching tag/apostraphe/bracket/etc\n\nJump to bracket works - on my setup when the cursor is positioned on a bracket Ctrl + B gets me to the corresponding complementary one. Again, check the shortcuts mapper.\nAbout the matching tags, I think it is not directly supported by N++. Perhaps some plugin out there adds that feature though. You could check XML Tools from Plugin Manager for example.\n. I'm glad that helps.\n\nDo you know about fixing up the function hint'er for js?\n\nI don't, sorry.\n. > do you know how to make the text functionalities like trim, work only on selection?\nHm, I don't think that's possible. You'll need to do regular search and replace on selection to accomplish that. \n. If you disable the _DSpellCheck plugin (you can simply move the plugin dll to _plugins/disabled folder) the problem will disappear. You can use that as a temporal solution until the problem is fixed.\n. FlushCallerUserInput() wasn't exactly unnecessary - its purpose was to flush the user input queue of main N++ window while FindInFiles was taking place and immediately after it finished. Without it if the user clicks in the main N++ window while the find operation is running the user input is not processed immediately because the user thread is busy searching but is put in the queue. After search finishes the stacked user input takes place which is undesirable.\nThe context menu actually gets corrupted because of DSpellCheck plugin which hooks to it to add spelling suggestions. It interfered with flushCallerUserInput() for some reason and became irresponsive making the Context menu inaccessible too.\nThe new version of the plugin doesn't have this problem even without this patch.\nThis patch was released just as a quick solution to the issue\n. Good catch!\n. That is fixed by #1187 (already merged in v6.8.7).\nThe issue can be closed.\n. Hi guys,\nI also don't have that much experience in Windows development and I haven't looked at the Compare plugin code so far. I simply provided Ufo with a generic progress bar class.\nHaving said that, I'm willing to help, it would be a pleasure\nbut I'm not aware of the Compare plugin problems at the moment.\nCan you tell me what are you trying to accomplish?\nRegards,\nPavel\n.

Hi Robert,\nI submitted the patch officially - #1549,\nThanks for reporting and testing.\nBR,\nPavel\n. @dail8859 , I have fixed only the find-in-files progress position (that is what the bug report was for). So the answer is no. I don't know whether the find dialog itself and go-to-line have the same/similar issue. Anyway, those are unrelated to find progress window.\n. Hello @cmeriaux ,\nThanks for commenting.\nThe functionality I'm talking about is not \"Move to other View\".\nBy \"move\" I was not referring to moving a file between MAIN view and SUB view.\nI was referring to moving a file tab to the left or right in the same view,\nin other words - changing the files order in one view (re-ordering files tabs if you will).\nThanks again.\nBR\n. Thank you guys.\n. Hello @SinghRajenM ,\nGreat, thank you for the fix.\nHello @donho ,\nThanks for accepting the fix so promptly.\nBR. Hm, it is present in my langs.model.xml also but it doesn't get highlighted.\nI'll check on native Windows when I get the chance and write back.\nThanks.\n. Right, got it! :)\nYou are right, it is working fine, thanks.\n. Thank you @SinghRajenM .\nBR. This fixes https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/260.. Strange, both views appear to have the same zoom level when I'm testing .... Hello @nightshaddow13 ,\nWas the backup N++ functionality enabled when the issue happened?\nThank you.. @prince2007g ,\nI couldn't quite understand your answer.\nThe version where the problem occurred was 6.9.1, correct?\nUnfortunately there is not much you can do.\nIn the forums people suggested using Recuva (or other program fro restoring accidentally deleted files).\nYou may try using Windows 'Previous Version' function - as far as I remember it is accessible through Windows file explorer - right-click on the file and there (or in the file Properties) there should be option like 'Previous versions'.\nThe last suggestion from a user in the forum was to open the file in a browser (how can one do that?!). The user claimed it was opened with it's original content (not all NUL) but I don't know details and it doesn't make sense to me at all.. Good job @Yaron10 !\nLooking at the code the same misbehavior will appear if you disable smart highlight select case in your example and then zoom in or out the scintilla view (Ctrl+mouse wheel in the view for instance).. Hello @Yaron10 ,\nIt is OK this way - the code will clear or set highlights depending on the setting which is more robust.\nThank you :+1: \nThank you @donho .\nBR. Due to the synchronization issues with backup operation I've made the backup run in the main N++ thread (the UI one) by posting in its message queue. This should cause any current long running user operation to first finish and then execute the backup save.\nThe problems so far were caused by the fact that some complex user operations were not considered 'long-running' (but actually are on very big files) and were not protected by the LongRunningOperation lock.\nStrictly speaking, the LongRunningOperation lock during backup is not needed anymore because now all Scintilla buffer operations are serialized via channeling them through a single thread but I have left them in case I have overlooked something.. @donho Done.. @donho is right.\nIn #240 the newest comments are about a crash while trim trailing space or other blank change operation is ongoing. As I said it is caused by the fact that some operations are not considered 'long-running' (no long-running lock for them) but for big files actually take enough time for the backup thread to trigger causing concurrent buffer access and crash.\nThe original #240 issue however is about Find/Replace crash but this properly locks the LongRunningOperation mutex and the described concurrent buffer access doesn't happen.\nDon, I think the #240  Find/Replace issue happened because of the Location Navigate plugin version at the time as described in the issue thread. @Barbapoux has simply used the same thread (#240) to describe another issue - the blank change/trim trailing space operation crash.. > Why isn't this const Progress* const progress\nWell I do not see point in it. Why isn't it const TCHAR * const dir?\n_In_opt_ might be informative but still I prefer to keep the code style as it is. I haven't found _In_, _Out_ or _In_opt_ anywhere in the code.\nThanks for the code review!\n. Good point, thanks.\n. That is a good idea, I'll submit another patch in the chain changing that.\n. My intention was to make things a bit faster by making functions inline. For setPercent() that's no big deal having in mind that it's being called 100 times total but isCancelled() is called a lot.\n. In PowerEditor/src/ScitillaComponent/FindReplaceDlg.cpp there are numerous other places where wsprintf is used actually. It's better for clarity sake to make a new patch that replaces all the insecure api function calls in the file with its security counterpart.\nI'll do it.\n. OK, about PCTSTR I get it, It makes sense. \nFor const Progress* const progress it doesn't look that beneficial to me.\n. > and thus little things can greatly impact compilation time.\nI understand but I'm usually more worried about execution time since the program is going to be used considerably more than it will be compiled. Although here one function call more is not a big deal.\n. This has nothing to do with the patch itself. This is supposed to be patch review, right?\n. Actually I did add this. I need to pass my class instance to the static window procedure. The way to do it is via CreateWindowEx LPVOID param\n. > I was curious, because I know that the standard guarantees that any pointer (to an object) can implicitly convert to an (identically const/volatile) void_, no explicit (void_) needed.\nI didn't know that, thanks.\nDo you think that making explicit something that is implicit in this case changes something?\nFor example if we have\nvoid GetNumber(int num);\n...\nshort int i = 8;\nGetNumber(i);\nGetNumber((int)i);\nchanges nothing really.\nOf course if we have\nvoid* i = &data;\nGetNumber((int)i);\nthat's a different thing.\nI don't think the explicit cast here can do any harm anyway so I won't bother making new patch-set.\n. When FindReplaceDlg::findAllIn is called for the first time the _pFinder is created. On consecutive calls to the function _pFinder is already there and it is not justCreated and the code at 1812 shouldn't be executed.\n. I haven't changed that. The change is caused by the automatic replacement of the leading spaces with tabs that I have done in the first patch from the chain. You can review the patches one by one to get a clearer picture of the functional changes.\n. You mean in FileManager::deleteBufferBackup() ?\nIt won't hurt to add LongRunningOperation op but strictly speaking it is not needed at all. All buffer operations are now channeled through a single thread so no need for locking at all.\nI can either remove all LongRunningOperation locks from FileManager in this file or add a lock in deleteBufferBackup() for consistency. What do you prefer?. Yes, at the very beginning of this Git diff I have changed the direct call to MainFileManager->backupCurrentBuffer() to ::PostMessage(Notepad_plus_Window::gNppHWND, NPPM_INTERNAL_SAVEBACKUP, 0, 0);.\nThis way the actual buffer backup will go through the message queue which is serialized - no concurrency.\nThe other operations here were not synchronized (locked) anyway but they also are always triggered from the GUI thread (again through the message queue). Am I missing anything?. ",
    "dail8859": "Thanks for looking at this. Keep in mind the split lines command and line wrapping are slightly different.Splitting lines has always annoyed me because it solely depends on the width of the window at the time the command is ran. If you have your N++ window small (e.g. 30 columns wide) it will use that width to split the lines. If you have the N++ window maximized (e.g. 200 columns wide on certain monitors) it probably won't split anything at all.\nThe patch makes it a bit more consistent. It keeps the default behavior if the edge mode has not been enabled, and if the edge mode has been enabled (usually because the user wants to delimit a specific column) it will use that width. \nSo in regards to your question, if the edge mode is enabled it will use that no matter if the window width is smaller or larger.\nIt was a  quick small patch, so if it doesn't get merged I won't care :) And it may be that I'm using the split lines for a slightly different reason that others I may not have considered. \nThanks\n. Thanks for merging. And yes I totally agree about possible user options to make things consistent. However sometimes the actual user-facing part (GUI, options, etc) outweigh the actual implementation. Plus GUI's can get pretty bloated if you start exposing tons of options. :)\n. By turning off the edge mode. \n. Either that or specify the exact column for the edge mode. If you read back through the comments on this PR the usage should be clear.\n. Hi. I'm actually working on a plugin that will do this. The language can be detected based on either file name, file extension, regular expression matches, or possibly other rules. If you have any more examples of files that Notepad++ does not currently detect I'd be glad to use those to test while I'm developing it. I plan on making the rules user-configurable too.\n. Its not a minor change so it would be a tough time getting the PR accepted. What I can do is finish the plugin and see what people think of it. If it seems like something useful and get a general consensus that it would be useful natively, then it would be pretty easy to integrate it in the main code. I'd hate to put alot of time into a PR just to get rejected.\nP.S. Just curious, is there a specific reason you'd want it supported natively instead of through a plugin?\n. It is already possible. Ctrl+Shift+T is set to copy the current line. However in the recent versions of N++ Ctrl+Shift+T was also mapped to open the most recent tab. (There is a shortcut conflict currently). You must change either the shortcut for \"Restore Recent Closed File\" or for SCI_CUTLINE\n. Yes, technically it is possible. Notepad++ uses Scintilla as the underlying component to handle the text editing. There is a Scintilla option called SCI_COPYALLOWLINE that Notepad++ does not expose as an option to change (although maybe something worth adding to Notepad++). I believe the only way to enable this is through a plugin, something like NppExec or Python Script\n. Nope! Disregard what I just said. Its not an option, its an actual command but it doesn't look like you can set up a shortcut for it...which is odd.\n. Closed by 02bdd11700e6fb225157aa59f1f5f1a453865cee. Might be nice to squash the commits. Keeps the history cleaner instead of adding code changes just to immediately undo them. \n. Pull request #209 can be used for reference. It behaves in the same way session files do. If a workspace file extension is defined, and the user double-clicks (or opens by any other means) a file with the workspace extension, the workspace is opened up in the first project panel. (and subsequently the file is not opened as a regular file for editing). \n. Closing since this is due to a 3rd party plugin.\n. @ariccio Are you that pedantic you are concerned about a label? I certainly wouldn't consider it a bug...\n. Will check on it later today. No surprise there are problems. Sure a lot has changed since the original PR.\n. @donho Commit has been fixed and rebased onto the current master.\n. +1 for the feature. I don't care for the polling idea either but as you said it can be pretty quick. You may want to take a look at some of the source code for TortoiseGit. It has a process (TGitCache) that monitors directories for changes. Personally I have no idea how it works or if it would be useable for you at all, but grepping through the source code I did find references to GetQueuedCompletionStatus and ReadDirectoryChangesW.\n. I pulled this code and built it. Seemed to work fine from what I could tell -- not that I put it through anything rigorous. \nMy one comment about it is that it is a bit confusing between adding a \"folder\" or adding a \"directory\". They sound the same but behave differently and even just testing it I kept getting them mixed up alot. Unfortunately I can't think of any good suggestions at this point...if I think of anything, I'll let you know.\n. Seems like this issue can be closed now. 9967c59912a05bfac57854e583d573877fdcb787 also addresses part of the concerns here.. Also, it may be crashing if it finds alot of matches. Each line can show up multiple times in the results window, possibly causing excessive memory usage.\n. Pull request #168 should fix this issue if/when it is merged.\n. User on gitter reported that the new DLL fixed their issue\n. Closing since this is for a 3rd party plugin.\n. I have also ran into this. My solution was to do exactly what @ffes does and maintain a list of opened files that had not been activated for the first time.\nI do understand why NPPN_FILEOPENED behaves the way it does. A \"file\" is part of a \"buffer\" (the buffer also includes information like cursor position, syntax highlighting, etc). Since there are only messages (e.g. NPPM_GETFULLCURRENTPATH) to work with the current buffer, you have to wait until the buffer is activated to use certain messages.\nI don't think changing the behavior of NPPN_FILEOPENED is a good idea because many other plugins may need it to operate the way it currently does -- whether or not it is right or wrong. \nA better long term solution might be to create new messages such as NPPM_GET_BUFFER_FULLPATH which takes a bufferID as a parameter, so that information can be retrieved about the buffer but without needing it activated.\n. :+1: Totally agree the behavior is inconsistent and needs changed. \n. This issue has been reported at #239. It is related to the DSpellCheck plugin (there is a temporary update to the plugin you can try there), so this issue can be closed and you can feel free to move to that thread. If you think there is something else causing the problem, please keep this issue open. Thanks for the report.\n. Also, not sure why the deinstaller would hang...it still may be related to the DSpellCheck plugin if it is not getting properly shutdown and the deinstaller cannot remove some locked files or something.\n. Closing since the original issue is most certainly plugin related.. Closed by 9b91480\n. Not sure what has changed but at least it seems fine now...\n\n. I've done a bit of research. I'm certainly not an expert when it comes to character encodings. \nThe reason this issue was discussed was to do away with the two versions of tinyxml, so that it can be more easily replaced with tinyxml2. Currently in the source code there are 2 \"versions\" of tinyxml, one to handle TCHARs (tinyxml), and one for chars (tinyxmlA). The language files and context menu are read in using tinyxmlA and converted using WcharMbcsConvertor::char2wchar(). \nEverything I've found states that Unicode should not be stored in TCHAR (i.e. wchar_t). Since all the language files have their own encoding due to their specific language, it would probably have to stay the way it is now with tinyxmlA reading it and using char2wchar. \nSo if all the XML encodings were handled the same way it would mean that all XML files would have to be read by tinyxmlA as plain char strings and ran through the WcharMbcsConvertor. I'm not sure if this would be an acceptable alternative to (eventually) getting tinyxml2 integrated. (FYI tinyxml2 uses plain char pointers).\nHopefully someone is more knowledgeable about this subject or has some ideas.\n. @milipili This question also relates to the XML files for configuration (config.xml, stylers.xml, etc) not just the XML files for translations. \n. What do you mean exactly? I guess through what I've read, and your most recent commit to the language files, I'd like this issue to determine whether: \n- We stay with the way things are now -- meaning two versions of tinyxml\n- Or also convert the XML configuration files to UTF-8 (so that config and language files are treated the same way) and only have 1 version of tinyxml\n. Thank you for the clarification. I agree we just stay with the way things are for now, and wait to make any decisions regarding XML (or something else) for the 7.x update.\n. :+1: \n. Pull request #214 is related to this. \n. \"Folder as Workspace\" feature covers this.\n. Currently implemented.\n. Do you have XML Tools installed?\n. Try turning off \"Set XML type automatically\". Should fix the problem\n. <rant>\n\nIt's too early to think about making Notepad++ cross platform! Notepad++ has major issues properly complying with the Windows API alone, There is massive technical debt that we need to pay off first!\n\nHonestly, N++ is one of the most stable programs I've used. Yes it has its occasional minor bug here and there, but what software doesn't. The majority of the bugs are simple logical errors...and I'm sure a few can be blamed on improper use of the API. If there were \"major issues\" then it would be much more unstable and problematic.\nI'd suggest since there are \"major issues\", then file bug reports! Not just \"this doesn't comply with xyz\", but bugs the user will encounter. Since you are aware that something doesn't comply, then create reproducible steps to make it fail. \n</rant>\n. I agree with this idea. It might work better if the settings were exported to a zip of all the XML files, since it really wasn't designed to glob all the XML settings in a single file.\n@Croydon Don mentioned in gitter this would most likely be in a future release, due to the difficulty in locating directories of multiple cloud services across several OSs. \n. @gjb56 maybe you could describe your feature a bit more? That way we have a better idea. \n. Also see #331. It seems lately XML Tools doesn't play nice with the newer versions of N++ for some reason. Try disabling \"Set XML type automatically\".\n. Try this forum. I'm assuming it is the author that started this post.\n. This issue has annoyed me for a while. \n. The problem with that code however is that the Dialog will always get focus, even when it wasn't focused when Alt+Tabbing away from N++. \nCould you use the wParam (to know when it is deactivated) and save a flag whether the dialog had focus or not, and then restore it once activated again?\n. I agree making them available would be nice but just as milipili suggested, make it a separate download since > 99% [citation needed] of people wouldn't need it. \n. This has most likely been happening due to XML Tools. Try disabling Set XML type automatically.\n. Most likely this is due to having word wrap enabled. You can turn it off temporarily to verify this. You are probably running into the same issue as #2078\n. Currently implemented.\n. :+1: Would love to see this! Possibly as a user option.\n. I'd even be ok with shift+enter or shift+\"click search\" to do a reverse search...although it's not a very intuitive solution. \n. Or where the return value is on the line before the name/parameters... \n. There is actually a Rust lexer already provided by Scintilla, it's just not wired up for Notepad++ to use it yet.\n. I haven't had a chance to look at the PR yet but I'm curious if there would be any performance impact. Especially loading large (200MB+) files. With 64bit N++ it will be able to load even larger files. \n. Closed by f6e47cd536f5c940de0eb8c378b71801dbeb6ae7\n. Using the PythonScript plugin is very flexible and can do lots of things like this. Insert date/time, filter characters, convert case, etc. For something that can easily be done with a plugin (and probably only targets a small group of users) I don't see the need to add it to the actual N++ code base. Not meaning at all its not a useful feature in some cases.\n. You could say that about any plugin at all...\n. > Since this is a duplicate of #2821 should I close this?\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\nI don't anticipate anybody getting it to work just for timestamp/date functions.\n\nAFAIK the source code isn't available anywhere so it would have to be rewritten from scratch.\n\nI couldn't get it to work reliably, unfortunately.\n\nWhat problems did you have exactly? I'm the author of the LuaScript plugin so I'm certainly interested in fixing any bugs you encountered. BTW this is how you'd use the LuaScript plugin to insert a date/time:\nlua\nnpp.AddShortcut(\"Insert Current Date/Time\", \"Ctrl+Shift+D\", function()\n    editor:ReplaceSel(os.date(\"%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S\"))\nend)\nYou can adjust the format and shortcut to your liking.. > Every time it would paste something, it would just paste an EOL character instead of whatever I wanted it to add.\nVery odd for sure, never seen anything like that happen.\n\nI meant a simple function like this should just be added to the main application instead of put into some plugin.\n\nProbably not as simple as you'd think. Sure, adding a few lines to insert the date/time is easy, however you'd also have to:\n- Make it configurable since everyone will probably want a different format\n- Add the ability to insert the (a) date, (b) time, and (c) the date + time\n- Add some GUI elements so that users can configure it\n- Point to documentation somewhere so they know how to use it\n- Validate the settings\n- Save the settings in XML\n- Make the GUI elements translatable\nAll very doable and in the end I'm sure many users would find it useful, but it takes alot more work than just a simple function.. A better idea might be to make a block of text selectable that contains Notepad++ version, OS version, and list of plug-ins (with version).  That way that block of text can be included when possible when submitting an issue. Many other applications do a similar thing. \n. Agreed. And any other relevant information. Especially if/when there is a 64bit version, that will be nice to know too. \n. Closed by #1381\n. I'd say its due to your regular expression. .* is allowed to match nothing. Even doing it lazily using .*? is allowed to match nothing. So you might need a bit more specific regular expression.\n. You are correct. But as I said before .* means 0 or more characters...meaning it will match 0 characters. If you want the entire line you can use ^.*?\\r\\n because it is forced to start at the beginning of the line.\n. Do you have . matches newline checked?\n. I'm not completely sure but I think this mostly just due to how Windows works. You can install MouseWiz and it will give you this capability for all applications. It comes in quite handy!\n. Related: #17\n. +1 I like in alot of programs how the mouse can be directly against the right of the screen and still use the scrollbar.\n. Plus it is good GUI design :)\n. See #547 \n. Further info: looks like the regex to find words doesn't pick up on words with a newline after them.\n. Looks like this issue also shows up in SciTE, meaning it is a problem with Scintilla.\n\nYou might want to file that bug over here if it has not been reported yet. (At least I'm assuming that's the best place to submit it...not really sure.)\n. I don't blame you. Not sure if they have a mailing list or something \u00a0you could use in instead.\u00a0\n\nOw god, sourceforge. Im not signing up out just for that, im sorry.\n. @milipili Issue is still present in Scintilla v3.6.6\n. Closed by 773397d6eab4bd59ea7104796936d9d52456c228\n. What version are you using exactly? I can't reproduce this in v6.8. Try changing your setting in Settings -> Preferences -> MISC and change Treat backslash a escape characters for SQL and see if that helps.\n\nEDIT: Ok I can kind of reproduce it now.\n. Ctrl+K. Also see the menu commands under Edit -> Comment/Uncomment\n. @Croydon Not currently possible. See here\n. Maybe be a bit more clear in the initial comment then :)\u00a0\n. I can kind of see what @donho means. With the white theme and a 0 border, the top of the text area has nothing to delineate it from the tab area any more.\n. Compared to alot of people here my Win32 API knowledge is limited, so I can't really offer any suggestions. I'm just speaking from the pure \"user\" aspect of the changes. :)\n. Exactly. Firefox is a great example! \n. > I think this is a good PR. In cases where the user has a white theme and would like a small border, they can always leave the border value set to at least 1.\nThen that defeats the whole purpose.\n. Closing since this is 3rd party plugin related.\n. Most likely you need to delete your langs.xml file in order for Notepad++ to pick up on the new changes. This file is most probably in C:\\Users\\my_user_name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Notepad++. \nNote: This file also stores custom settings if you have done things like extensions and keywords so those would be lost.\nRelated issue #1205. I guess that would be a different issue. The word highlighting is separate from the auto-complete. New keywords would need to be added to the css.xml file.. If you do edit them you are more than welcome to open a pull request so they get shipped with N++. . It works for me in v6.8.1. What is your file encoding (toward the bottom right of the screen, ANSI, UTF-8, etc)?\n. Additional info: If there is only 1 match in the file then the replace works. If there is more than one match, the replace doesn't work.\nLooking at the code seems to be due to starting to search at the caret's position, but in theory it would have to start before that to be able to \"look behind\". I don't know of a simple solution currently.. Just curious why wouldn't this be labeled a bug? The find result clearly show a line without a match in it when it should.\n. I understand the behavior behind it but it seems like alot of GUI real estate just to let the user keep a number in a box.  \nPresenting the user with options can get confusing especially when going to a line seems like such a simple task. Half the battle of any new feature is making it intuitive and non-invasive. \n. My thinking is that nobody will ever be like \"ok good I have an option to not remember the last search\".  One way is to not add any options but always remember the last search and if that line is not valid then just clear out the textbox. That's just off the top of my head would have to give it more thought when I have time. \n. I'm curious if there just isn't enough bytes there for N++ to detect the encoding correctly, thus throwing away the last two bytes (using the HEX-Editor plugin only shows 1 byte after opening). Also, it looks like adding another byte (e.g. \"a\\0bc\") will cause N++ to correctly open a file.\n. I think it should be as simple as adding the new keywords to the langs.model.xml file. I think there is a recent pull request that adds some keywords to the PHP language so you can see how that was done. \n. So just keep in mind that means it will be a while before those changes propagate into the N++ repository since Scintilla isn't updated that often.\n. You'll want to report it over here since it is an issue with the plugin itself. And also make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin.\n. It would probably be very CPU intensive, especially with a file of any decent size since you need to apply a regex to the entire file to count word matches.\n. Yes for the word count. Also, length in bytes does not necessarily equal the number of characters, but probably wouldn't be too bad to keep track of.\n. Might be best to squash the commits instead of changing a file just to change it back :) \n. Closed by 48e9b84b\n. First I'd suggest trying it with all plugins disabled. Move or rename your plugins directory and restart N++ and see if the issue is still there. That way you can make sure it is not a plugin first.\n. I've created a plugin that implements the concept of elastic tabstops. Although in this case it more for aligning code, the exact same concept applies to TSV files...so I figured it might be of interest to this issue.\n\nSee this forum post for info and download link.\n. Go ahead and open an issue on its Github project. Should be very doable. \n. Couldn't you just record a macro that reloads the file then does Ctrl + End?\nEdit: Well it almost works since a dialog pops up asking if you want to reload it...oh well :/\n. The whole point of having the ability to record macros is to make as much as possible not built in and just allow the user to extend the functionality to meet their needs. \n. It is a bug in the plugin. See #747, plus it looks like on the sourceforge page for the plugin it has been reported.\n. @cmeriaux Any other plugin written in any language can do the exact same thing, because they all must use the underlying messages and notifications.\n. Just from a quick glance at the code it looks like it may not be too hard. If you look at how NPPM_SAVEALLFILES is handled, it just calls fileSaveAll() which loops through the buffer ids and saves them. In theory it should be fairly straight forward to add what you are proposing.\n. :+1: \n. Just curious, is there a reason you pass the file name instead of the buffer id? I have no objection to the way it is now, maybe it is just easier to do it this way...either way it is up to Don.\nAlso, according to the CONTRIBUTING.md file, it is recommended to use tabs instead of spaces.\n. :+1: \n. Do you have backups enabled? If so I'd try turning those off and see if it happens again.\n. Yes that is default. There were similar issues in the past that have been addressed. This shows up more with large files (since it takes longer to save them) which is exactly what you are seeing.\n. Definitely still a bug that needs fixed. \n. Closed by 6c7ca02fe\n. It is a known issue with XML tools that has been reported numerous times. I think there is an update to the plug in (not available through the plugin manager yet) you can install manually. \n.

I'd suggest splitting this into two pull requests since it addresses two totally separate issues; one being a bug, and one a feature.\nAssuming this ever gets merged :)\n. @sanastasiou \nI'm curious what is different about your use case that NPPM_GETPLUGINSCONFIGDIR is not sufficient. As far as I know this is how all plugins store their settings. \nOr is it just simply that you \"want\" (rather than need) your settings stored in the cloud settings directory?. Duplicate.\n. Correct me if I'm wrong, but just glancing at this looks like it wouldn't even compile...along with other problems with the changes you've made.\n. The \"official\" support page for UniversalIndentGUI is over here so you will probably have better luck posting the report over there, however I'm not sure if the developer is still active on the project :(\nYou may take a look at the CoolFormat plugin since it looks fairly similar and updated much more recently.\n.

I'll still give it some thought and see if any other people might have a better idea.\n. Duplicate.\n. Notepad uses the width of 8 characters to represent a tab. Notepad++ by default is set to 4. It mostly just comes down to personal preference. You can change it in the Notepad++ settings.\n. It is possible. Would be nice to have a specific option for this. I know some other editors do and it can make a big difference. As a temporary solution, I think if you install nppexec you can specifically make Scintilla calls and use these if you'd like this sooner rather than later :)\n. Have you tried disabling all of your plug-ins? Are the files you edit on a network drive? More information would be appreciated. What version are you using and what operating system? \n. I'd suggest disabling your plugins first. You can do this by renaming your plugins folder to something else temporarily before starting Notepad++. This will at least determine if it is a plugin issue or Notepad++ itself.\n. @donho Side note: In cases like this #694 would be quite handy ;)\n. Duplicate\n. Seems to already be in there for me. I'm on v6.8.3\n. Yeah. A while ago I downloaded a user-defined language for CoffeeScript and it shows up in that menu. Maybe it isn't picking up all UDLs for some odd reason...\n. This should be reported over at the Sourceforge project page for XML Tools since this is not a standard plugin for Notepad++. Thanks.\n. 3rd party plugin related.\n. This issue has been reported before. It was due to Notepad++ including the SourceCode Pro font for a release or two before this issue was noticed. However you might still have your font or a setting from a previous install. You can make sure in your style configurator to not use the SourceCode Pro font for the default style. Or make sure it isn't in your C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++ folder still. Here are some of the other reported issues you might read through in case they help.\n. I can confirm something is definitely wrong. Even at step 2 it shows it has \\r\\n line endings but reports as \"Unix\" style line endings. This is very problematic since any time you hit enter it inserts \\n instead of \\r\\n. \nThis file is UTF-8-BOM. I removed the BOM from the file and when I reopened it, then it correctly detects the line endings. So it appears the BOM is causing N++ to incorrectly detect line endings in this case. @colejohnson66 I'm not meaning you have to edit the file this way, just hopefully this additional information will help someone fix the bug quicker. :)\n. Somehow I got around downloading the exe. Here is the file (renamed as a png, because Github requires repository write permissions to attach a txt but not a png).\n\n. @sanastasiou I think you need to remove the commas. Looking at the code (and trying some tests out myself) it expects them to be separated by space characters only.\n. With the 3 extensions, the first two had a comma after them, so for example it was trying to match *.cpp, (notice the comma at the end).

The problem is if fread() is called multiple times, then UnicodeConvertor->convert() is called multiple times, which causes m_pNewBuf to point to the last read in chunk. Then after the entire file was loaded, getEOLFormatForm(UnicodeConvertor.getNewBuf(), ...) was being used which was only trying to detect the EOL mode from the last read in chunk. If this last chunk started with \\n then the file was detected as Unix line endings. The file linked from issue #1002 happened to have just the right situation where this occurred. \nI am not very familiar with different types of file encoding and never have to deal with them myself.

Since this would be a non-trivial patch, I'd like to know it would actually be accepted before spending my limited free time on it.\n. The lexer that is used for diff files comes from the Scintilla project. In general code from Scintilla is just used as-is. So if you needed to make changes to that file then that should be submitted to Scintilla.\nHowever using a plugin would probably be the easiest option for you. You might want to look into using indicators to mark parts of the text. This allows the normal Scintilla lexer to highlight the diff file (as it is already doing), and the indicators just lay over top of the styling (e.g. smart highlighting uses indicators). \n. No problem. If you have any further questions related to plugin development feel free to post on the forum.\n. Highlighting for Wysiwyg strings.\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\n. :+1:\n. Just FYI, related community post. \n. Try following these steps.\n. Do you have backups enabled? \n. Yes at one point it was removed (I believe v6.8) because it was causing issues for some users. With the latest version (v6.8.7), if you have it installed it will ask you if you want to keep it. So just reinstall it and you should be good from now on.\n. Did you have the plug in installed?\n. The DSpellCheck plug in I assumed the original question was about... \n. > I'm talking about the built-in one\nThere is no spell checking \"built-in\", it has always been provided by a plugin.\n. It normally came with Notepad++ but was still a plugin.\nTo clear things up, just use the Plugin Manager and install the DSpellCheck plugin.\n. Closing since this is 3rd party plugin related.\n. There are actually quite a few styles (and even languages) missing in the non-default themes. I was looking into updating the styles programmatically (somehow) but that's not very straight-forward, and making something look \"appealing\" is not my forte. \n. It seems to be working for me. I stepped through Notepad++ with a debugger, and even modified one of my plugins to catch it.\nTo make it fire I open 2 or more files, and drag and drop the tabs to reorder them.

Tried a default install of v6.8.8 with a test plugin to catch this notification:\n- Moving files between the same view does send the message\n- Moving files between views does not send the message\n- Opening or closing files does not send the message\nI can't say whether this is the expected behavior or not. @sanastasiou Is this the same result you are seeing?\n. I've never had a need for this notification so I've never really looked into how it's used, but from the sounds of it, it does appear to be a bug. \n. Two suggestions:\n- Do you have backups enabled? If so disable that.\n- Try disabling your plugins.\n. Ok thanks.\n. I've just copied the built exe over the installed version.  Not really a nice or easy way, but haven't had a situation where I've had to do it a lot. So I just did what worked. \n. :+1: \n. The file has mixed line endings, which is causing it to get confused. Use Edit > EOL Conversion and choose a format to unify the line endings.\n. Set it to Unix and then back to Windows.\n. That is exactly what I tried. I open the file, try to move the lines, it gets stuck. Which is exactly what you are seeing.\nConverted the line endings to Unix, then converted it to Windows. Now I can move lines fine.\nIf you want to see the line endings you can you can select View > Show Symbol > Show End of Line and you can see some end with CRLF and some just end with LF.\n. Glad it's working now :)\n. @donho Thoughts on this?\n. @donho\n. @PauloFrancaLacerda There's no such lexer as SCLEX_SCSS in any version of Scintilla.\n. @donho \n. > we need a set of file to valide these lexer as well.\nYes I agree this would be good. Do you have any ideas? Are you thinking actually include example files in the repository or just simple tests until the lexer seems fine?\n\nBTW, by memory we need to enlarge the lang array as well.\n\nYes this was one of the things I noticed and wasn't sure what side effects increasing the lang array would cause.\nAlso, to anyone else reading this I'm not proposing I do all of these myself :) so feel free to help out.\n. Unfortunately adding a new lexer is a bit tedious, and every time a new lexer is added all other PRs for lexers need fixed because there will be merge conficts :(\nUsually about 10 files need modified. For example if you take a look here you can see this pending PR for adding Visual Prolog.\n. @donho Oh and also some other defines would need adjusted.\n. Just as an FYI, this is not something Scintilla supports, which means Notepad++ can't do it. Quote from the Scintilla documentation:\n\nSTYLE_CONTROLCHAR This style sets the font used when drawing control characters. Only the font, size, bold, italics, and character set attributes are used and not the colour attributes.\n\nI agree it would be nice to be able to set the color, but it would have to be something Scintilla implements.\n. > if they'are refusing to implement this feature\nAFAIK they never said it was a bad idea, just that someone has to take the time to do it implement/test it.\n\nWould it be technically possible to code an alternative\n\nNo. The only way is to modify Scintilla since it handles the low level drawing functions.. You would seem to be correct. It appears the SCE_R_IDENTIFIER is not defined. You can work around this for now. \n- Open your stylers.xml file not using Notepad++\n- Find the section that starts with <LexerType name=\"r\" desc=\"R\" ext=\"\">\n- In that section add:\nxml\n<WordsStyle name=\"IDENTIFIER\" styleID=\"9\" fgColor=\"000000\" bgColor=\"FFFFFF\" fontName=\"\" fontStyle=\"0\" fontSize=\"\" />\nWhen you open the configurator again you will now have an IDENTIFIER style.\n. As far as I know you'll have to do that to each style. You might be able to use the Global Override but that does it for everything not just R. Never tried it myself though.\n. I guess technically there is 1 other style but not sure what that covers. You can try adding\nxml\n<WordsStyle name=\"INFIX EOL\" styleID=\"11\" fgColor=\"000000\" bgColor=\"FFFFFF\" fontName=\"\" fontStyle=\"0\" fontSize=\"\" />\nAnd see if that helps.\n. Related to #2016. Closed by f3abc30c7af6e5b67e7670df98a9fd82e026d946\n. That's actually a pretty good idea. However it would be best to report this to the PluginManager author. \n. Please report this to the author of the plug in. \n. Doesn't happen for me. Have you tried disabling your plugins?\n. Hmm, still can't get it to give me the exception. Maybe someone else can try.\n. Already reported #73. This is an issue with Scintilla and not Notepad++. \n. Actually, this looks like it can be disabled by setting the C++ lexer property fold.comments to 0\n. Just providing that information is not enough. How did you cause it to occur? Is it reproducable? Try following these steps.\n. > NP++ is disregarding the pipe as a column delimiter\nNotepad++ doesn't try to separate things into columns, it just displays the file as-is, character by character. In your case there are line feed characters in some of the fields. The reason Microsoft Notepad seems to display it correctly is that it is not made to handle Unix line endings (i.e. line feeds) so it ignores them. \n. > I guess you are referring here to just the active session?\nIf you mean just the file that gets saved, then yes.\n. @donho Yes that is correct. . The CHARACTER rule is applied to strings wrapped in single quotes. The values are not able to be highlighted currently. To highlight JSON, the C++ lexer is reused, so in theory with a few changes to the code and xml file, you could specify a list of values to highlight (e.g. true, false, null)\n. I would highly recommend not using Notepad++. It is purely created as a desktop application. I'd say you are better off using something else. A quick Google search found numerous embeddable editors.\n. Not sure what you mean. You should be able to select an option under the Language menu and it will highlight your code. \n. \n. In your style configurator make sure you don't have the global override enabled.\n. You can also delete your stylers.xml file most likely located in your APPDATA directory (no idea where Win10 stores that). This will reset all style settings.\n. If everything is working fine now you can close this issue. \n. Reported #1247\n. The underlying bug is still probably the same though. \n. Closed by 1abac157993685c4f6345443f6256403526858ad\n. Duplicate of #1243 also tuple isn't a keyword. \n. @donho Please prefer PR #1243 over this. tuple is not a keyword but rather a data type. If tuple was added then we might as well add all the other data types (e.g. dict, list, set, etc)\n. Duplicate.\n. :+1:\nThat is actually a really good idea. I think this should also apply to the information in the status bar.\n. Related #49\n. JSON support is in v6.8.4\n. Assuming you are using the default theme, try deleting (or moving if you want to save it) your stylers.xml (probably located under your appdata folder). This should reset all the language styling.\nEdit: Maybe also langs.xml.\n. It works for me. What does the bottom left of N++ say? It should say \"JSON file\" when you open it. There isn't a lot of highlighting to JSON. \n. Notepad++ != VSCode\nInternally there is not a dedicated lexer to JSON. It reuses the C++ lexer, so it just sees them as strings. When Scintilla is upgraded eventually there is a dedicated JSON lexer that has much better support.\n. This is what I see. When setting the language to HTML:\n\nWhen setting the language to JavaScript:\n\nIn the second example the regex is bold (although barely noticeable). For the JavaScript language you can change this through the Style Configurator for now. I do agree that the regex should be styled like the first example though.\n. Also, if this is not what it looks like for you, try deleting your stylers.xml file most likely in your %APPDATA% directory. \n. @donho Checking into this I see alot of discrepancies between the javascript and javascript.js lexer. Is it assumed that these two lexers try to style things similarly (obviously the embedded javascript has a different background color, etc)? For example I see there is a type2 keywords list defined for the javascript.js lexer but never used in any style.\n. Settings > Preferences... > Tab Settings\n. The newest version is v6.8.8. :)\n. Most likely you are using the Source Code Pro font. There have been issues with it not showing ampersands. #1123, #679, #552, #547\n. If this is working as expected, please close this issue. Thanks. \n. I agree this would be awesome to have. The problem is if you turn that feature on in the C/C++ lexer then any time you have a #if var statement it will not highlight it unless var was defined in that same file.\n. I agree it would be nice for #if 0 to be handled specifically, but that feature request would need to be made to the Scintilla developers. \n. @dolbnya That is what I was originally talking about. The problem is if you have:\n``` C\nif MY_DEFINE\nputs(\"error\");\n\nendif\n```\nAnd turn on that preprocessor property, then it will not highlight it because MY_DEFINE has not been defined. There is also lexer.cpp.update.preprocessor however many times when editing C/C++ code the defines are defined in headers which Scintilla won't know about.\nThere is no way to tell the lexer to only disable #if 0 but not any other blocks.\n. @BBW1 If you have backups enabled try turning that off to see if it helps.\n. My experience with editing large files and having the backups enabled has never turned out well for me.\n. Hmm, looks like 3b39bc2 may want to be skipped for now since Scintilla had a bug that wasn't fixed until 3.6.1\n. 3.5.6\n. @donho PR updated with just the 2 commits.\n. Since this discussion has moved elsewhere I'll go ahead and close.\n. This isn't how you add a new language. Plus, just from looking at it, it wouldn't even compile.\n. What theme are you using?\n. I'm not able to run Notepad++ or SciTE currently but looking at the PowerShell lexer it looks like it doesn't handle any escape characters at all. This would have to be a modification made by the Scintilla developers.\n. As of Notepad++ v7.5 the Plugin Manager is no long being shipped with Notepad++. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.5-released.html\nAll Plugin Manager related issues should be reported to https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/issues. Moving discussion to #2090\n. Please report this to the author of the GEDCOM lexer. \n. Closing since this is an issue with an external lexer.\n. Even with the dump any other information you can provide would be helpful. \nWhat type of file was it? How \"large\"? What plugins do you have installed? Do you have backups enabled?\n. Yeah I'd definitely recommend updating.\n\nNot sure what you mean by backups?\n\nSettings > Preferences... > Backup > Enable session snapshot and periodic backup, this has cause a lot of errors before when running macros for a long time or in your case lots of find/replace instances. Sounds like this is what caused your file to get partially corrupted. Although this normally is only seen with large (and by large I mean 10MB+) files. \n. Seems to be working fine for me. Plugin causing it perhaps?\n. What you want are indicators. They are used to display additional information over the top of styling. There aren't any \"clean\" snippets of code from Notepad++, but in general just define your indicator, and when a whole word is \"selected\", find all the occurrences of it and mark it with that indicator. Referencing the Scintilla link should be sufficient.\n. Also, it's not easy to follow but this is some of the code that does it within Notepad++\n. You'll have to close it or wait for an admin to see this. Should be a button down below to close it. Also there is a Notepad++ forum where you can post in the Plugin Development thread and possibly get some Scintilla help. \n. Closed by d7a0649c1\n. Keep in mind that just because the file is <2GB, Scintilla also has to allocate a lot of other memory for styling, folding, lexing, etc. But I do agree that more specific error messages would be appropriate in case it isn't actually hitting a memory limit.\n. Unfortunately that probably isn't a good solution since some file types (like XML, HTML) use a lot more memory by Scintilla than say a plain text file. \n. These lexers are from the Scintilla project. Notepad++ just uses them as-is and does not modify them. You'll have to report it to Scintilla...assuming this bug hasn't already been fixed in their latest version.\n. Closing since this is a Scintilla issue. \n. Do you have backups enabled (Settings > Preferences > Back-up)? If so definitely turn this off. Most likely this is the cause. \nAlso, it could be a plugin causing the issue. You can rename your plugins folder to something else so that Notepad++ won't load them.\n. Duplicate of #1190 \n. Could you include your debug info (from the menu ? > Debug Info). \nAlso, what settings are you using under Settings > Preferences > Backup\n.

What version of Notepad++ do you have? It works for me. It looks like it is already using https by default.\n. I would guess proxy or browser. If I enter that URL into my browser using http I get redirected to https. \n. It would seem it is not actually an issue that needs fixed and could be closed. . > Can some other plugin destroy one of those?\nNo. It has to be in a specific vector in order for it to be destroyed.\n\nIt could cause massive problems to other plugins\n\nEven if it were possible, it wouldn't be any more of a concern than say a null pointer exception within a plugin. Both would be pure programmer error.\n. Please do not repost issues that you have already posted. #1401\n. @codynguyen1116 The issue means if you type out that code from the very beginning the auto-completion of the parenthesis is not correct. The problem is when you type the second ( it assumes it doesn't need to auto-insert the closing parenthesis because a ) is directly after it.\n. Just looking at it looks like it seems ok. Kind of difficult to properly review it without it being in a PR. \n. The lexers that highlight code comes from the Scintilla software. Notepad++ just uses this software as-is. Any new features for highlighting PHP would have to be made to that project.\n. Win7, VS2013 Community Edition, both Debug and Release compile fine for me.\n. Duplicate of #1095\n. > Is this a falsepossitive ?\nI'd assume if you are running cppcheck then you have enough knowledge to determine if that could be a false positive or not. :smile: \nAlso, Editor.cxx is part of Scintilla. They seem to be using CppCheck themselves so I'd guess either they know about it or you can report it to them. \n. It has been reported and discussed :) #1260 \n.

I just updated GeForce, created an account (unfortunately), updated drivers, turned on share, but have not had any luck reproducing this. I guess it would be nice to narrow the bug down to an exact trigger (specific setting, hardware, software, etc).. Thank you for this additional information!\n. > not being able to turn on whitespace marking\nIt's on in the screenshot, just sometimes the little dots it puts where the space are can be hard to see.\n. You can change the color it uses for marking whitespace under the style configurator. Notepad++ only uses a single pixel to indicate whitespace. Technically with a plugin you could increase the size of that to say 4x4 pixels but currently Notepad++ doesn't give you that option. \nSince there isn't actually any bug here, you can close this issue.\n. > Did the default color for whitespace change?\nNot as far as I know.\n\n#1260 suggests that it might be from Scintilla,\n\nThat issue is with the end of line and non-printing symbols, where this issue deals with whitespace (spaces, tabs).

There is a markdown lexer already in Scintilla. It's just not \"wired up\".  Which is what that issue you referred to is about. \n.

Here is the current set of lexers.\n\nIs there any documentation available for writing these definitions?\n\nYour best option is to look at existing lexers. You can always try posting to the Scintilla project as well. Presumably no one else is currently working it but you never know.\n. No clue. You'll have to see if it compiles and how well it works. It makes me wonder though why someone would go to the trouble to make one and it not get built into the official Scintilla. \n. I'd recommend getting the latest version of Scintilla/SciTE (which does build with VS2015) and grab the required lexer/header/etc from that repo and get it working with SciTE. Once you do that you can probably submit a patch to the Scintilla project. Then whenever Notepad++ updates it's internal version of Scintilla (which doesn't really happen that often) that lexer will be available (with a bit more work within Notepad++)\n. First of all keep in mind that the Notepad++ project doesn't accept patches for lexers/scintilla, it just uses it as is and updates it from time to time.\nHowever you are certainly able to build a custom SciLexer.dll to use. There is a little bit of work within Notepad++ to get it fully working. I'd recommend taking a look at this PR adding a new lexer. Several files need some minor tweaks. \n. @WGriffing Things are kind of slow moving around here so feel free to help any way you like :) Also, keep in mind that you shouldn't make any changes to anything under the scintilla directory. Notepad++ uses Scintilla as-is. \n. It may very well be fixed in the latest version of Scintilla.  The version Notepad++ uses is several versions behind. \n. So I don't know fortran at all, but what exactly is the problem?\n\nBecause it looks like it is highlighting comments.\n. Try deleting (or removing if you want it saved)  your stylers.xml file. Should fix it. \n. > In your screenshot, did you have free form or fixed form selected?\nHonestly, I'm not sure. Just picked one and pasted in the example.\n\nI think the fixed form has a theme-related bug that prevents any syntax highlighting in any theme except the Default.\n\nYou are correct. This is actually the case for quite a few other languages as well. Anytime a new languages is added, each theme technically needs all the styles added as well but that can be quite tedious so normally just the default theme is updated.\n. Yes.\n. You have XML Tools installed and it is trying to autocomplete the tag as well. \n. Closed by b47de8048d2e2217d8bcc5eb8ee2a09c6329a6d5. Closed by f6e47cd536f5c940de0eb8c378b71801dbeb6ae7\n. Did you test out this PR at all?\n. First try a few things. Update Notepad++ to v6.9.1 (if possible). Also disable your plugins because it very well could be one of those causing it and not Notepad++.\n. Closing due to no response.\n. It still has a sourceforge link because you are on a really old version of Notepad++. \n. Closed by #2071\n. At least for the drag-and-drop this is due to Windows, not Notepad++. Windows doesn't allow non-elevated processes to send messages to elevated processes. \nFor reference see https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/patricka/2010/01/28/q-why-doesnt-drag-and-drop-work-when-my-application-is-running-elevated-a-mandatory-integrity-control-and-uipi/\nSo unfortunately it would be nice to have this work, there doesn't seem to be a safe way of allowing it.\n. There should also be an update to stylers.model.xml for the styling information?\n. Closed by 9967c59912a05bfac57854e583d573877fdcb787. Try deleting your stylers.xml file most likely located in your %APPDATA% directory. If you have custom style changes then just move it or rename it temporarily.\n. If you delete yours then it will get replaced by a master copy so there wouldn't be any point providing another one. \n. Inline Javascript works for me. \n\nI rarely use CSS/HTML/PHP/Javascript at all but I'm not aware of it highlighting inline CSS at any point.\n. The code that actually highlights the text is from the Scintilla project. This code is used as-is without any modifications so any changes as you suggest would have to be made to that project. AFAIK it isn't already implemented but I'll look into it a bit incase it isn't just as simple as an option to turn on in the HTML lexer.\n\nit shouldn't be hard to add since there already is highlighting available for CSS\n\nIt is alot more complicated than ;)\n. Try following these steps.\n. Please report this to the developer of XML Tools.\n. You mean remote files as in network drive or using the FTP plugin?\n. Then I guess #913 would cover this then.\n. Most likely #1930 has addressed this issue. If you still run into this problem again once v6.9.3 comes out, please feel free to reopen. \n. This is a problem with the TextFX plugin and not Notepad++.\n. Closing issue since:\n- Monitoring of log files is available\n- A shortcut can be easily assigned through the Shortcut Mapper\n- ReloadButton plugin is available\n. The goal was probably to state what a CSHTML file is since I'm guessing most (including myself) have no idea what it is.\nYou can register that extension to open with HTML by using Settings > Style Configurator, under Language select HTML, and add cshtml in the User ext box.\n. Closed by #2079\n. The whole Shortcut Mapper could use an overhaul. Here is a short forum discussion from about a year ago.\n. Closed by 1abac157993685c4f6345443f6256403526858ad\n. No clue. You'll have to take a look at PR #2029 or ask there. I would assume that there is no functionality change, just GUI-based changes, but can't say for sure.\n. Closed by #2079\n. Opens fine for me. There is a bit of a performance hit since it has some very long lines (Notepad++ can't do anything about it because it is a Scintilla limitation). Make sure you have the latest N++ version and try disabling your plugins in case it is one of those causing the crash.\n. Just realized you might have meant using is a UDL (as opposed to actually editing it), either way it still works fine for me.\n. Try disabling all the plugins and turning off periodic backups to see if that helps at all. \n. Since its really not feasible to send a 500MB file, can you possibly show a show snippet of the file and what you are using to search and replace? \n. Thanks. I'll see what I can do to recreate it. \n. That's interesting. For some reason the Python Lexer (from Scintilla) stores fold levels differently. I wrote a short bit of Lua...\nLua\nfunction showFoldLevel()\n    for i=0,editor.LineCount do\n        print(i, (editor.FoldLevel[i] - SC_FOLDLEVELBASE) & SC_FOLDLEVELNUMBERMASK)\n    end\nend\nFor a simple Python script such as...\nPython\ndef main():\n    if True:\n        pass\n    x = 5\nIt prints\n0   0\n1   8\n2   16\n3   8\n4   0\nBut for other languages, such as C++\nC\nvoid myFunction() {\n    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i){\n    }\n}\nIt prints\n0   0\n1   1\n2   2\n3   1\n4   0\n. I looked deeper into the code and it seems to be based on indentation so it's not as easy as just dividing. Plus I'd hate to have to add a special case just for python. I submitted a bug report to Scintilla to see if the odd fold level is intended or not. \n. > doesn't support indentation with tabs.\nTabs have always worked fine for me.\n\nevery line indented with n spaces will be attached on fold level n\n\nYes this is the conclusion I came to as well. Also, indenting with a tab sets it to a fold level of 8 no matter what the width of the tab character is set to.\nHere is the Scintilla bug report.\n. The Scintilla author reports the Python lexer is working as intended. To properly fold the nth level of indentation is not straight forward. It is possible this kind of thing happens to other lexers.\n. There is a plugin called LineFilter2 that I use quite often for digging through large log files. It's not perfect and has room for improvement, but definitely something to take a look at.\n. Like I said it has room for improvement. It doesn't do it as far as I know. You could always write one regular expression with all the patterns or'ed together.\n. Duplicate of #1730, #1624\n. Works fine for me. Post a screenshot or exact steps to reproduce the issue. \nAlso include your debug info (Found under the \"?\" menu). You can also try disabling your plugins to see if it is one of those.\n. Yeah I can reproduce it now. That's really odd.\n. Please do not repost issues. There is PR #1677 that fixes your previously opened issue, but it has never been merged yet.\n. Duplicate of #1095 \n.

When working with large files it is best to turn off periodic backups. \n. > Periodic backups are off.\nGood to know. I know there's been several reports that periodic backups of large files cause this exact symptom, that's why I mentioned it. The next best thing to try is disabling all the plugins to make sure it is not one of them causing it.\n. This is a known issue and was fixed. Try searching before posting a new issue ;)\n.

Please report this to the PluginManager repository. \n. Try reporting to bug to the PythonScript repo. Or possibly someone on the forum may be able to help.\n. Go ahead and submit a PR. \n. Use the LineFilter2 plugin. Does exactly what you are asking for.\n. Interesting...could you attach your C# plugin that intentionally throws the exception? I already have the DSpellCheck plugin.\nI already see some obvious buffer overruns in the N++ code.\n. Ah OK, I'll just try something like that then. \n. Duplicate of  #1681\n. Can't duplicate the result. Can you post your debug info (located under the ? menu). It may be a plugin (e.g. XMLTools) trying to auto-detect the language. \n. > What can be done?\nReport it to the author of the plugin.\n. I don't know enough about AppVeyor but this may be related to #1942 with a fix provided in #1943. \n. I guess for reproducibility purposes I should explain some steps. \n1. Use DSpellCheck (or any other that comes first alphabetically)\n2. Use a \"bad\" plugin. In this case I modified one of mine (LuaScript) to throw an integer in \"beNotified\".\n3. The first screenshot is using the current master branch. It reports DSpellCheck as the problematic plugin.\n4. After applying this patch (still using the same plugins) it correctly reports that LuaScript is the one with the problem.\nAlso the funcInfo string was way undersized.\n. >  also we need to \"unban\" the dspell plugin\nThis error message alone was not the cause for it being \"banned\". I think alot of the problems were on Win10 but honestly I don't know the current state of the plugin. There are some old issues on here somewhere that go way more in depth.\n. @donho Sure. I'll let you know when it is ready to review again. \n. @donho Ready for review again.\n. Closed by a3bb9d294adf3247972543b016c6c3e3ef56b8d8\n.

This would be best posted to the DSpellCheck issue tracker. \n. There's no need to remove the Python code. Nobody is forcing you to use the themes and many other use them.\nPlease try to construct more coherent issues.\n. :+1: \n. Keep in mind that when Notepad++ searches files it has much more overhead than say grep would. It has to load it into a Scintilla document and use Scintilla's search options/features to do the actual searching.\nTo be clear I'm not stating it can't be improved at all...I certainly wouldn't argue if it was faster ;)\n. Can processing instructions also show up in HTML or is it restricted to XML only?\n. There would appear to be a bug somewhere (most likely what you pointed out) since the width increases before it needs to in some cases with word wrap turned on.\n. If you are talking about the PHP lexer then those changes need made to the Scintilla project. As for C++ coding guidelines it is all in the CONTRIBUTING.md file. \n. Currently it is not possible to increase the size without the use of a plugin. \n. Closed by e10847b429ea7799425e9e88925cb208ba14d4b6 as this makes the spaces much more visible.. I can verify that it does not correctly highlight it in the last case. However this appears to be a Scintilla issue that is still present in SciTE v3.6.6, see below. \n\nIt would probably be best to report this issue to Scintilla's issue tracker.\n. Define \"huge amounts of text\", 100KB, 1MB, 100MB, more? Also, try disabling all of your plugins. \n. I haven't been able to reproduce it. Any other info you can provide would be helpful, file encoding, syntax, etc. \n. I've tried quite a few times and also followed the steps in #489 but can't reproduce this at all.

So I don't know if forcing the views to have the same zoom would be a good idea or not as some users may intentionally have different zoom levels set.\n.

You will have to wait for the next release of Notepad++.  Also keep in mind by default Notepad++ creates backups of files in the appdata directory. \n. Agreed a hint to look in the backup directory might be nice. But since it sounds like the backups is pretty much what you needed I'll go ahead and close the issue. \n.

See: https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/issues/3\nThere have been some known problems with the Plugin Manager crashing because it can't download the plugin (e.g. sourceforge being unreachable, proxy issue, etc). This may be unrelated to the number of files open. You might try downloading different plugins or trying again later. I tried opening 50 files and it worked fine for me. \n. Glad to hear it is working. If it keeps happening feel free to reopen.\n. I tried with v6.9.2 and wasn't able to make it crash at all. A few suggestions:\n1. Disable your plugins. You can do this by renaming your plugins folder to something else temporarily.\n2. Change your settings to see if using tabs vs. spaces makes any difference. \n3. If possible upgrade to v6.9.2 (doubt this will change anything but you never know).\n. PR updated and simplified. Any language that uses the C++ lexer will be able to use the Doxygen keywords. Also works for the other themes.\n. Try deleting (or temporarily removing) your stylers.xml and langs.xml (probably located in your appdata directory) to see if this solves the issue. Several versions back JavaScript was changed a bit internally and sometimes the styles get a bit messed up.\n. Fixed since version 6.7 (see 1d92d189b30c49ed65372635cc2561ad76077894). Current Notepad++ version is 6.9.2\n. If a file has been edited since the search took place, it will jump to the orignal location which may be different than its current location (due to adding/removing text).\n. You can add custom extensions through the Style Configurator:\n\n. > Instead, \"contract\" is highlighted only in line 1 as shown here: \nThat is from the smart highlighter, not due to the find dialog.

Closing since there isn't actually a problem.\n. @Eldaw Interesting...never realized there was a PR so similar.\nI'm not attached to the terminology I used, it's what Visual Studio used so figured it was an OK way of doing it. I understand that VS is targeted to a more technical audience than N++ is. Presumably in the majority of cases (not all) if a user is converting line endings they have some idea what line endings they want even without terminology.\nI think it is important to keep the CR/LF/CRLF terminology that way if someone disagrees with the naming scheme they can at least know exactly what line endings they are converting to.\n\nThe important part is to not trick Mac users into using CR.\nAlso, many Mac users probably don't know they are using a Unix system.\n\nI totally agree, however most Mac users probably don't know the difference between \"Mac\" vs \"Old Mac\" (although maybe they do? I'm not a Mac person :) ).\n. Provide more info. There isn't near enough to go on here.\n. It could have been something like having the wrong search mode, or having \"Wrap around\" not checked. Glad to hear it is working.\n. Closed by e31e37ebc3bdd8d34b0cb61f1e3b81477fcdfbaf\n. Does it happen for any other plugins? Do you have privileges to install plugins?\n. It works for me using Win7. Maybe someone else can see if they have the same issue on a different OS version.\n. Since this appears to be a bug with the plug-in you should contact the developer if it. \n. I apologize if I misunderstood your post from several days ago.\nNotepad++ and the Plugin Manager are created by different people.\nIf it is a problem with the Plugin Manager then you need to report it here.\nIf it is a problem with PyNPP then you need to report it to whom ever developed it...I don't know the best place to submit it.\n.

Related: #1169 #417\nI think there's a bit of discussion on the forum somewhere that Notepad++ doesn't play nice when using Nvidia's desktop manager (nview?). Do you happen to be using that as well?\n. Good to know. AFAIK there isn't a solution, but I can't say I've followed the issue in that much detail. \n. It is based on the current syntax of the file. What type of file are you trying to comment\n. Do you have any type of reproducible test-case?\n. Haven't been able to reproduce the issue. You might try temporarily moving your langs.xml and stylers.xml (most likely in your %APPDATA% directory) and see if that fixes the issue.\n. Since this is a 3rd party plugin this issue needs reported to the author of the PowerShell lexer. FYI Notepad++ has a built in lexer for PowerShell.\n. Not sure the point of opening the issue. You already referenced the issue that was closed and the commit that fixed it.\n. I'm assuming you have changed the system default font? Because normally the summary window and status bar do not use mono-spaced fonts.\n. Is it a bug? Yes.\nDo all bugs get fixed? No. Especially ones that affect a very small percentage of users.\nKeep in mind with the next release of N++ that it will probably cut off a bit more because some of those numbers will have commas in there.\nWhen you use non-standard settings don't be surprised when you run across non-standard behavior.\n. This appears to be an issue with Scintilla, even in their latest version (v3.6.6). \n\nIt is probably best to post this issue over to their project on SourceForge.\n. Quote from Scintilla author:\n\nIts a feature. From feature-requests:#738 implemented by change set c5f2e5.\n\nSo unfortunately there is nothing N++ can do about it.\n. I would agree that the \"feature\" is not correctly implemented...but who am I to say ;)\n. This has to do with the way the plugin was compiled (e.g. missing version info) or registered with the Plugin Manager. It would be best to report this to the author of the Python Indent plugin. \n. Screenshots? \n. I am assuming this is because you have auto-complete turned on. After you type the first ABC then the next time you start typing it (and it tries to auto-complete it) then when you press Enter it is grabbed by the auto-complete window. \n.

When a plugin is \"registered\" with the plugin manager it saves a hash of the file. Later when a user downloads a plugin it rehashes the download to make sure that it got the expected files. If the hash does not match then you get that message. \nIn most cases this warning can be ignored...however, if you are overly concerned about security it may be good to cancel the installation. \nThe best course of action would be to contact the authors of the individual plugins because they need to update the registration with the plugin manager. \n. @MAPJe71 Interesting...I thought it always saved a hash for every plugin, but you are correct that alot of the plugins do not have the hash in the XML file.\nEither way the plugin authors still need to correct the issue for their plugins.\n. Couple things to try. If you uninstall then make sure you remove any files hanging around either in the installation directory or in your %APPDATA% directory. Old settings and plugins may still hang around. Also try starting it with plugins disabled. You can either move the DLLs or start Notepad++ from the command line and pass in -noPlugin.\n.

Previously it would just redirect to this project, however now that you forked from MAPJe71's repository it no longer redirects to the this official repo.\n. Already fixed in 3b1e722ba6ad318f0dc4b1fde070860e0c292917\n. In the past this is usually a symptom of having session snapshots enabled. I routinely work with large files and never used this option due to this exact problem. \nSee if you have Settings > Preferences > Backup > Enable session snapshot and periodic backup turned on. If so turn it off and see if the issue reoccurs at all.\n. As a solution for now you can install LuaScript (via the Plugin Manager) and select Plugins > LuaScript > Edit Startup Script and add the following:\nlua\neditor1.MouseSelectionRectangularSwitch = true\neditor2.MouseSelectionRectangularSwitch = true\nThis will allow you to press Alt after selecting to turn it into rectangular mode.\n. Ah yeah you are right. Try this instead:\nlua\nnpp.AddEventHandler(\"OnReady\", function()\n    editor1.MouseSelectionRectangularSwitch = true\n    editor2.MouseSelectionRectangularSwitch = true\nend)\n. No clue then. Works fine for me.\n. Oh...you'll have to press Alt while dragging. Unfortunately there's no easy way to change it after text has been selected. Guess I partially mis-read your initial post. \n. Since this is a problem with a 3rd party plugin you'll have to report this issue to that developer. (Though I doubt the HEX editor is being developed any more). \n. This is due to your custom theme \"VS2012-Dark\" not defining a style for preprocessor comments. Take a look at PR #1178 which added this into the built in themes. You'll probably have to edit your theme's xml manually to add that in.\n. Partially related to #1500 which never got any explanation. \n. Attached is a zip of a VS solution which creates 2 bare minimum plugins. One of them creates a scintilla instance and the other asserts that it doesn't receive a message from it. Build the solution and copy the 2 plugins over to Notepad++'s plugin directory. The one will cause an assertion error.\nI tried digging into this since but I don't know enough to understand the entire sequence of events going on within Notepad++.\nPluginError.zip\n. And now I also found out I'm receiving notifications from _invisibleEditView!\n. > This is the weirdest highlighting I have ever seen in a text editor!\nAlso the weirdest coding style ;)\nThis issue appears to also be in the latest version of Scintilla (the component that does the parsing). You'll have to report this issue to that project here. \n. Most likely this is due to a plugin. Disable your plugins to see if this happens again. \nIf it happens with them disabled please provide a set of steps to reproduce the issue and your debug info.\n. These were added in 5fa40fbf7e5c2385da2420014c89e8cc7fda059d (i.e. v6.8)\nDeleting your langs.xml file should solve this but keep in mind this also stores extra settings such as additional keywords if you have set any. \nRelated to #1205\n. Since this is related to a 3rd party plugin you'll have to report it to the developer of the PowerShell Lexer.\n. Try turning off session snapshot. Quite possibly the same bug as #2226\n. Try turning off session snapshot and see if that helps. If not try disabling your plugins. \nPossibly related to #2253 and #2226\n. There are mechanisms in the code to delay the backup but there are so many cases where it could potentially corrupt the file not all of them are handled. I'm going to keep this open because it is still a problem that needs addressed. \nThe related issues have the same root cause. Either a single solution needs found or all these individual cases need handled.\n. Your regular expression is wrong. You need to use get.*Color\n. It is a known issue with the source code pro font.\n. @cmeriaux Yes it is unfortunate that in several cases the \"supporting\" code (GUI, parameters, etc) out-weigh the actual feature.\n. I profiled loading the provided xml in issue #2245 which showed poor performance of swscanf() when dealing with long lines since it has to keep calling wcslen().\n\nNow it takes less than a couple seconds compared to over 1 minute.\n. I tried with SciTE v3.5.6 (which is the version N++ is on) and it still has the same results, meaning it isn't a bug with the Lexer. So I poked around using LuaScript ;)\nNotepad++ is detecting setlocal and endlocal as SCE_BAT_COMMAND (not sure how the lexer works, guess because it is at the start of a line).\nIf you add setlocal and endlocal to Style Configurator > Batch > Keywords the the style looks correct and N++ detects these as SCE_BAT_WORD.\nScite uses this list for Batch keywords.\n. @MAPJe71 Good catch! I messed up my regex when I merged the two lists ;) Should be fixed now.\n. Could you provide your XML file, or even just a small subset of it. One function should be enough to reproduce this.\n. I just modified an existing API file so need to provide it anymore. \n. Duplicate of #2155. There is a work around described in that issue.\n. Please try the latest version of Notepad++ since you are still on a very outdated version.\n. Duplicate of #1651 \nI looked into this at one point and just using SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE is not enough. Notepad++ uses Scintilla v3.5.6 and it seems that a newer version of Scintilla is required to support ligatures. So once Scintilla is updated internally this will most likely be possible.\n. That's interesting. I tried the exact same thing before without any success. Though I tried it on Win7 which might be a difference. \n. This is what I tried:\n- Install the Fira Code font (I think I used the medium)\n- Set the global Notepad++ font to use Fira Code\n- Type something like != and nothing happens. (I can see the font is getting changed, it just doesn't seem to pick up on the character sequences at all.)\nCan't remember where I put that call in that function, but I'll try exactly where you said and see if that works for me.\n. Success! \n\nI found I had all the different fonts installed but none of them worked...however I installed them a while ago so I downloaded and installed the latest version of the regular Fira Code font and it worked perfectly.\nOn a side note I don't think it matters when SCI_SETTECHNOLOGY is set because I manually changed it by my scripting plugin while a file was already opened and it immediately worked. :)\n. > Only Fira Code and Fira Code Retina draw with ligatures. Light and Medium do not.\nIs this something you discovered yourself or is it documented somewhere?\n. It won't currently work \"out of the box\". The text rendering needs tweaked but you can do it with a plugin. Keep in mind support for ligatures is not officially supported so you might run into issues. \nThis is the easiest way I know (without recompiling) to get ligatures to work in Notepad++:\n1. Install a recent version of Fira Code (use either the normal font or the retina as those are the only ones that seem to work).\n2. Install LuaScript via the Plugin Manager (you can also use PythonScript if you are more comfortable with it or want to use a 10 ton hammer).\n3. Select the font via Settings > Style Configurator > Global Styles > Global Override. Select \"Fira Code\" for the font style and turn on Enable global font\n4. Edit the LuaScript startup file by doing Plugins > LuaScript > Edit Startup Script and add the following code:\neditor1.Technology = SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE\neditor2.Technology = SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE\nRestart and enjoy.\n. @treyharris The lower level text drawing is handled by Scintilla which is what Notepad++ uses internally. So any technical questions are probably best directed toward that project, especially regarding what SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE does exactly.\n\nThere's no \"Light\" style checkbox, so there's no way to get that unfortunately, but the correct solution there is for Notepad++ to offer weight selection.\n\nYou are correct that Notepad++ does not offer anything to set a \"light\" version, however the underlying Scintilla control does allow setting a font weight. You can use a scripting plugin (such as LuaScript referenced above) and set the font style to a lighter weight using the call to SCI_STYLESETWEIGHT.. > Then should this issue be closed?\nThere isn't official support for ligatures as it stands so I would say this should still be left open.\n\nSC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE should be set by default\n\nI know in the past there have been issues regarding the quality of the text rendering on certain systems and I'm not sure if changing this would cause any types of problems like that. Scintilla allows different technologies so I would assume there is a good reason why one is better than another in certain cases, but again these technical questions are probably best for the Scintilla project as I don't know how all this works on a detailed level.. Thanks for the additional info. . Awesome thanks. \n. This is a problem with a 3rd party plugin. You'll have to report it to the developer of the power shell lexer. \n.

When developing one of my own plugins I sorted the list of keywords using _tcsicmp() however I found out this not exactly what Scintilla expects. Quote from Scintilla doc:\n\n...the list should be sorted with the punctuation characters '[', '\\', ']', '^', '_', and '`' sorted after letters\n\nHowever the MSDN documentation states:\n\nTo illustrate when case conversion by _stricmp affects the outcome of a comparison, assume that you have the two strings JOHNSTON and JOHN_HENRY. The string JOHN_HENRY will be considered less than JOHNSTON because the \"_\" has a lower ASCII value than a lowercase S. In fact, any character that has an ASCII value between 91 and 96 will be considered less than any letter.\n\nYou may want to look into this because if it is sorted incorrectly then the auto complete list may close when attempting to type a valid keyword.. Try to fully type both of them.. This shows what I mean. JOHN_HENRY can be typed, but for JOHNSTON as soon as the S is typed then the auto complete goes away:\n\n. @anil-shrestha It seems to be working fine for me now, thanks.. It's a bit complicated since you made commits directly on your master branch, but if you are ok with it I can fix it for you. Keep in mind I'll have to force push it and you will probably have to reset your local master branch.. Should be fixed now. I rebased the commits and squashed them. I force pushed directly to your master branch in your repository.. I did it all with the TortoiseGit GUI, so not 100% sure the exact commands needed.. @simon33-2 That goes a bit more beyond what would be considered \"auto-completion\". Most editors consider this something like \"snippets\". There are a couple of Notepad++ plugins that does exactly what you describe (e.g. SnippetsPlus, FingerText, and others).. Still has a problem with regular expressions locking it up.\nAlso using ~~escaped~~ newline characters with regular expressions is broken, even with \"Quick find\" turned off:\n1. Open new file\n2. Press enter 3 times\n3. Open find dialog\n4. Set mode to Regular expression\n5. \"Quick find\" doesn't matter if it is checked or not\n6. Search for \\r\\n (assuming windows line endings)\n7. No matches\nDoing the above steps with the v7 release counts 3 matches.\nAlso, even on what I would consider \"small\" files (~500kB) having lots of matches can cause N++ to have noticeable lag. If possible I'd suggest once the first match is found don't search any further than you have to (e.g. only the text visible on the screen). However, this would probably also mean getting the Scintilla notifications if the view is scrolled to research the text on the screen.\n\nEnabled by default, not saved in settings.\n\nForcing someone to use this every time they open N++ is not a good idea. Personally I open large files quite often and search through them. I wouldn't want to to have to uncheck this every time.\n. I can reproduce it. It looks as if every time it moves a pixel it gets set to a normal cursor, and then back to the hand cursor.\n```\nNotepad++ v7.1   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Oct 15 2016 - 23:30:30\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : ON\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 7\nPlugins : ElasticTabstops.dll LuaScript.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll PluginManager.dll \n```\nAs a side note, in my plugins I have hyperlinks in their about dailogs and found this code which seems to work fine for converting static controls to hyperlinks, and also uses the Windows built in hand cursor (which looks way better)\n\nI'm not saying this code needs to be used as a drop in replacement but might be a good reference to look at another implementation.\n. Nevermind ... I'm dumb.\n. @bandtank You are assuming Notepad++ needs to only allocate a single byte of memory for every byte in the file...which is far from correct.. Personally I'm not a fan of a global setting that covers all languages. Some languages require the comment is at the start of a line (not sure if any require it not be on the start of a line). \nAlso, from looking at the code it doesn't seem like these settings would be persistent.\n. @oirfeodent I'm not saying this is the wrong way of doing it. I'm honestly not sure how hard it would be to make it a per languages setting (it might be quite difficult and not worth it). This may well be a far easier way of doing it that would probably help out a lot of users. Current there is no way of controlling comment position, at least this gives the user some control over it :)\n. I just verified this issue is also present in the latest version of Scintilla (which is what notepad++ uses internally). This issue needs reported to the Scintilla project.\n. This seems to be the same type of issue that Python has (see #1898). Fold levels are based on number of leading spaces.\nThere are a couple temporary work-arounds though. You can multiply the fold level you want with the number of spaces. You can only fold the first few levels though. Alternatively you could change your indentation to use 2 spaces (which is the YAML specification) or 1, then you can fold more levels.\n. @CanadianJeff You'll have to wait for the next version.. In that case it was already solved a long time ago. It is in your preferences...\nSettings > Preferences... > Recent File History > In Submenu. This was recently fixed in 181b4875215d259e45a01ac0244eebcc0bd81ea1 and will be available in the next release.\n. That doesn't sound like a bug. If the file on disk has changed then it should notify you.\n. I can confirm I'm seeing the same thing when catching the NPPN_DOCORDERCHANGED notification. According to the documentation (keep in mind it isn't 100% correct) the hwndFrom value does carry other info with certain notifications.\n. I guess instead of checking hwndFrom you can see if nmhdr.code is >NPPN_FIRST and < \"some value\".\nI'm glad you pointed this out though because I'm sure I would have ran into this before too long, because I was doing the same thing just filtering out messages purely based on notifyCode->nmhdr.hwndFrom == nppData._nppHandle\n. Related PR #2348 which provides a better error message. \n. You expected a \"helpful message\" now you say it is useless. \nI never said it was the best solution but for now it is the easiest. \n. > All notepad++ need to do is saving them into \"%APPDATA%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\x86\" or \"%APPDATA%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\x64\" \nIf you simple do as you suggest and change where Notepad++ searches for plugins, you have now caused problems for alot of users that had existing installations. Since Notepad++ had originally stored them in %APPDATA%\\Notepad++\\plugins directory, then the user would find their updated installation doesn't have any plugins installed (since the new Notepad++ would be looking in a x86 or x64 sub directory). This change would also in turn kill off the existing Plugin Manager as it now would not store the plugins in the appropriate locations. (Yes the Plugin Manager could be updated but would cause alot of confusion for users.)\nHowever, Notepad++ dropped the Plugin Manager in v7.5 (still usable just no longer shipped in the installer) and is going to implement its own built-in plugin manager (see this page). If this new implementation does change how/where plugins are located, then this would be the best time to also try to incorporate a solution to your problem.. > I said notepad need to move the current plugins to these subfolders on first startup.\nNow knowing this and rereading your messages then yes I see that this is what you were meaning. I interpreted what you were meaning a bit differently (apologies). Since Notepad++ can already determine which plugins are 32 vs 64 bit then in theory this is a possible solution.\n\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.5-released.html is not the issue that implements the new plugin manager. Can you share the issue number on github, please?\n\nI pointed to that page to show that there is a new plugin manager in progress. There is no issue on Github that I know of. I'm not sure how far this new plugin manager is or how it will function exactly.. Currently it is not coordinated because I'm assuming Don Ho is just working on it himself. Pull requests are normally tied to issues but not each commit in the repository is. . This issue is also present in the latest version of Scintilla (which is what Notepad++ uses internally). \n\nIt seems that \"text/html\" is not recognized thus it is trying to color it as JavaScript. This should be reported to the Scintilla project.\n. According to the MSDN documentation they aren't actually reserved keywords. However it may not be a bad idea to add the contextual keywords anyways.\nThe C# lexer wouldn't be able to distinguish when the \"contextual keywords\" are applicable or not. Do you (or any one else familiar with C#) think this would be a problem? Meaning it would always highlight these contextual keywords. \n. I agree that it would most likely be rare to see these keywords elsewhere in code. \n\ndoes Notepad++ support keywords with spaces in them?\n\nNot it does not. \n. Since these updates won't be available until the next release (and just in case you aren't aware), you can go ahead and add these yourself. Go to Settings > Style Configurator > C# > INSTRUCTION WORD and add them to the \"User-defined keywords\" on the right. \n. > If this is beyond the scope of current UDL\nIt is. UDL (although quite powerful) cannot match the ability of manually coded lexer.\n\nIs it a plugin? Contrib to Notepad++ (custom coded? Enhance UDL?) ? Contrib to a dependency?\n\nI would suggest creating your own plugin. I think the only \"official\" documentation is here however it is quite outdated and is not near complete. I would suggest trying to take a look at other lexer plugins and start from there. I'm not sure how difficult it is to include another lexer, I know it is not simply just call a function. You might want to take a look at the HTML lexer to see how it handles nested languages.\n. Although the PluginManager is incredibly useful, it is developed by a 3rd party developer. The author of the PluginManager is aware of the need for 64-bit but no clue when that will be available.\n. As of Notepad++ v7.5 the Plugin Manager is no long being shipped with Notepad++. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.5-released.html\nAll Plugin Manager related issues should be reported to https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/issues\nNote that you can still use the plugin manager with v7.5 you just have to install it manually. (or upgrade from a previous version of Notepad++ that already has it). You can't. It doesn't work of real regular expressions. It uses the windows API and only supports wildcards (*) and I think question marks.\nTo search in multiple file types use something like *.cpp *.h *.xml\n. Since that is from a 3rd party you need to report this to the developer of the Customize Toolbar plugin. \n. The way I see it is that it is completely functional as a stand-alone plugin, and there would really be no added benefit to having it natively supported (plus it would add more functionality that falls under the Notepad++ project to maintain).\nSince the original bug report was related to a 3rd party plugin I'll go ahead and close this.

It is probably \"ANSI\" or \"UTF-8\" and since these are all common characters I suspect everything is fine. If you are that concerned you can use a hex editor (or the hex editor plugin) to verify it.

I'd assume under most circumstances it is not representing more Bash code, rather as arbitrary text. That being said...in some situations I can see why it is not useful for very large blocks to be a single color. Notepad++ uses a (mostly) unmodified version of Scintilla to do all the highlighting, so any changes would have to be accepted by that project (their issue tracker is here). All that is hard-coded within Scintilla. There is no way to tell Scintilla to ignore or skip a style.. Closing as this would have to be something implemented by Scintilla..

If you feel Notepad++ is the problem, paste the text into Windows' plain-old \"Notepad\" then inspect the file with a hex editor..

I'm not aware of any other text editors that would find overlapping matches by default. . > Knowing the expected behaviour\nDocumentation is very light when it comes to expected behavior :) so I understand the confusion. If you do need overlapping find/replace I'd suggest looking to some sort of scripting plugin for Notepad++ to do this for now. The one problem with overlapping matches would be replacing. In your example if you search \"abca\" there would be 4 overlapping matches but if you replace it with \"xxxx\" then there would only be 3 replacements...which may or may not be expected.. This issue is also present in the latest version of SciTE (v3.7.4) so this is best reported to the Scintilla issue tracker here. It may already be open on their issue tracker.\n\n. UTF-8 doesn't require a BOM, so there is a difference between \"UTF-8\" and \"UTF-8-BOM\". You can select the desired encoding under the Encoding menu. You can also set the default encoding for new files under Settings > Preferences > New Document > Encoding. . I can't say for sure. Some applications require a BOM, some do not. In some applications, if the file does not have a BOM then it tries to do a bit of analysis on the file (look at byte values, etc) to determine the encoding. It may be that the file is so small that LibreOffice has a hard time determining the encoding from just the 2 bytes...such that it shows \u00c3\u00a4 instead of \u00e4. .

Please post your debug info as it might be related to an old version of Notepad++ or one of your plugins installed.. Thanks for the info. Glad you got it figured out. . Late reply, but this isn't a bug. It's a confusing feature of Scintilla. There are ways of turning it off with a plugin though if it is too annoying.. As of Notepad++ v7.5 the Plugin Manager is no long being shipped with Notepad++. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.5-released.html\nNote that you can still use the plugin manager with v7.5 you just have to install it manually. (or upgrade from a previous version of Notepad++ that already has it installed). The Hex editor plugin is not part of the official Notepad++ project. This needs reported to the author of the Hex editor. . Duplicate of #3266. Try choosing a different font in the style configurator to see if that fixes it. . Can you try to provide any more useful information other than you have weird signs?. I agree this needs reported to the hex editor project, as there's nothing Notepad++ can do about it since it crashed inside the notify() call.. The DSpellCheck plugin has been added back in for v7.5.2. It is called the \"Wrap around\" option and has been there for years.\n\n.

But after some work and saving a lot of files with verbose backups, no one can say who saved a particular file because the filename does not include the identity of the person.\nI would argue this is more \"abuse\" of the feature as opposed to its intended use :) \nThere are other tools that are more well suited to this kind of version control.\nI'll close for now but you are welcome to continue the discussion here or move to the Notepad++ discussion forum (which seems to be down currently). > everybody thinks the specific way they want to do things should be made a feature in the standard product.\nWhich is why I (and obviously you, and several others) are huge proponents of customizing through scripting \ud83d\udc4d .

Without a set of steps to reproduce it then there really isn't much to go on. . This means that the SciLexer.dll file is not located in the correct location. It has to be in the same directory as the Notepad++ executable. If I recall the 64 bit build is in a fairly different location than the 32 bit build.. Take a look here and see if that helps. . Also if you are still having problems make sure you are building the SciLexer.dll file as 64-bit if you are using 64-bit Notepad++.. > When selecting more, it becomes uselessly slow.\nDefine \"uselessly slow\" because it works just fine for me even when selecting a nearly 2000 character word. Having a limit probably isn't a horrible idea but apparently I'm not running into the same issue you are.. Oh gotcha. Personally I think a limit like that is fine since the smart hilighting is meant to provide feedback to the user to quickly see other instances of selected text. If the chunk of text is large then it really doesn't provide much meaning as you probably won't be able to see other instances of the match. Though this is just my opinion.\nAs for the actual patch, see https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#do-not-use-java-like-braces \n.

As far as I can tell that after you select the long line you click under the line, which puts the cursor at the end of the next line, and scrolls left to show the caret.. @operasfantom That's not a bug. That's a feature of Scintilla. . @operasfantom See https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/bugs/1676/\nThis is a bug report on the Scintilla tracker. . To turn it off you have to set the lexer property. To do that you either need to modify the Notepad++ sourcecode, similar to this section:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/c978a18894228e1265428253011ef5814b97088f/PowerEditor/src/ScitillaComponent/ScintillaEditView.cpp#L948-L952\nOr you can set this property with a plugin, such as using LuaScript and running:\nlua\neditor.Property[\"fold.cpp.comment.explicit\"] = \"0\"\n. Not type //{ or //} I guess.  Not sure what you mean. . Please post comments on that PR instead of opening new issues.. These changes need submitted to the Scintilla project as they maintain all the lexer code. It is also possible this bug is fixed in their codebase.. As suggested please report this the to developer of NppFTP to have them investigate this, and reopen if it is anything N++ related.. Cannot reproduce. If this happens again I'd recommend disabling plugins to see if it one of those causing the issue.. @SinghRajenM Looks like it was force pushed and contains 0 commits.. @Yousha \nYou opened the issue regarding a plugin that is not related to this project, thus it was closed. If you have an issue with the actual Notepad++ program (which it appears you do), please open a new issue. And let's keep the comment civil please.. First a reference to the Scintilla documentation regarding SCI_SETFIRSTVISIBLELINE (emphasis mine):\n\nThese messages retrieve and set the line number of the first visible line in the Scintilla view. The first line in the document is numbered 0. The value is a visible line rather than a document line.\n\nThe key here is visible vs document line. The way you used SCI_SETFIRSTVISIBLELINE is working appropriately. A \"document\" line can be broken into multiple \"visible\" lines due to wrapping (in my case ~14 document lines for the first visible line). \nI'm not sure exactly what you are wanting...but for example if you are wanting line 3 to be at the top then you'd have to try something like this (this exact code is untested but tried the same thing with Lua):\n```cpp\nint LineToScroll = 3;\n// Subtract 1 since lines start at 0\nint VisibleLine = ::SendMessage(curScintilla, SCI_VISIBLEFROMDOCLINE, LineToScroll - 1, 0);\n::SendMessage(curScintilla, SCI_SETFIRSTVISIBLELINE, VisibleLine, 0);\n```. Glad it's working for you. . v7.5.3 has been released which should fix the issue. . DSpellCheck is still showing up in your debug info so it could still be causing problems. Issues for the compare plugin should be reported to the plugin's developer. . AFAIK the way zooming works is that it selects a different font size as opposed to scaling it by a percentage (which could lead to blurry looking text). \nSince this deals with the Scintilla text editing component you are best to report this to their issue tracker here. @Predelnik Thoughts? Should v1.3.3 possibly fix this?. > What smarts would be required?\nAn actual IDE which knows whether or not __THING__ is defined. Notepad++ has no way of knowing which preprocessor block it should actually use, thus it is messing up the folding.\n3638 isn't a bug, it is a (confusing) feature provided by Scintilla. Any bugs/fixes that need made to the C++ lexer would have to be posted on the Scintilla issue tracker.\n\nAs a side note you can kind of fix the folding a bit abusing the feature above. If you use this code instead:\n```cpp\nif defined(THING)\nvoid func1(void) { //}\nelse\nvoid func2(int param) { //}\nendif\n//{\n    // do stuff...\n}\n// other stuff...\n```\nYou will see the folding behaves a little better (but not perfect).\n\n. The limit of 30 is hard coded.

That just limits the GUIs input. . Please post your debug info as it might be a plugin causing the crash (or also disable your plugins).

Simple things could be added (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) then users would want more complex operations (conditional statements, formulas, floating point, exponential, etc). Then allowing users how to define columns (tab/space/comma delimited, strip white space, etc).

Can code be made more efficient? Sure...most code can with proper profiling, algorithm selection, and optimization. \nHowever, there is no argument as to why \"2%-6%\" is bad. Notepad++ will always require more CPU usage than Windows Notepad and should not be used as a benchmark. It doesn't make sense to compare the two.\nThere are numerous Notepad++ features that can affect CPU usage:\n- Syntax highlighting - Some are much more computationally expensive than others\n- Code folding\n- Word wrapping - Scintilla has to work very hard to determine where lines should be wrapped\n- Displaying margins\n- Smart Highlighting - Searches the text on the screen for any new matches\n- URL detection - Searches the text on the screen for anything that looks like a URL\n- Indentation guidelines\n- Brace matching\nAll these require processing of the text beyond just, \"scroll to the next line and draw it on the screen\". Also, plugins can also be a factor as those can require additional CPU resources, so disable those if you want a better idea of what Notepad++ is using.\nNotepad++ uses Scintilla for the text handling/processing so some optimizations might be better directed toward that project. That is probably where > 75% of the CPU usage is required for Notepad++.\nSo to make this report valid/useful, I'd recommend actually trying to profile the code and see if there are areas that could be improved rather than a blanket statement of Notepad++ needs more CPU than Notepad.\n.

Each syntax style has its own configurable background color. Normally you don't see this because it is all the same color, but for some cases (as you have pointed out) the background color is different, so it looks like it is \"highlighted\"..

This can be changed with:\nSettings > Preferences > Default Directory > Use new style save dialog\n\n. I don't see how many people would find this useful at all. I agree since there are ways of launching Notepad++ in a read-only mode currently, that it would be a better solution to do as @sasumner suggested.. If you are worried about \"accidentally\" modifying a file, then I recommend you not open it up in a tool made to edit files. There are much better mechanisms to ensure file integrity such as Operating System level permissions, backups, or version control software. . @untroll\nThis is related to #4169 which has some similar issues with syntax highlighting. (which is the response I gave 5 minutes after you posted in the Gitter chat).\n@proeng \nUnfortunately this is not something that should be fixed in the Notepad++ project. The syntax highlighting is done by Scintilla and since it is not correctly highlighting the parenthesis, then the brace matching is not working correctly. Brace matching only matches braces that are in the same style.. @IliaAnastassov \nSince you didn't provide any info about what Notepad++ version you are using, and no debug info I'm going to assume you are on an old version (older than v6.7.8) because there is nothing in the code any more that creates this message. Plus it was already reported and fixed (~3 years ago).. I agree that there is an underlying problem with how paths are handled. Since this issue is in regards to the dialog box showing up (which no longer exists), I'll close this particular issue and any further info and discussion should be done on #4078. Settings > Preferences > Multi-Instance works for me as well.. > P.S. I don't have any idea why git shows changes in the functions isCertificateValidated and isAssoCommandExisting - I did not touch them at all!\nIt appears this is due to the file originally having mixed line endings.

However the file is about 135 Megabytes...so much larger than I originally thought. I'm assuming in this case the . is used as a thousands separator rather than a decimal separator. :)\nThis file has no newlines, so it is completely on a single line. This is a known issue with Scintilla (the core of Notepad++) that it does not handle extremely long lines. So in short there is nothing Notepad++ can do to open and display the file.. @tgschultz If you still have the old config.xml file it would be interesting to take a look at it and see if someone could replicate the issue and find the problem. Ideally it would be nice to have the exact original but if you feel better you could remove some of the more personal info such as recently used files and find/replace history.. So nothing seems odd about the file. I tried it out and it worked fine for me.\nHowever you mentioned multi-instance. Some quick testing shows that modifying settings while using multi-instance does have problems. For example if you start instance 1, modify some settings, then start instance 2, it does not see these new settings. I would guess that further testing would show that when each instance closes it writes its own settings to the xml file. . I haven't looked into the code but what is the difference between a buffer being \"dirty\" and being \"modified\"?\n\"dirty\" meaning unsaved\n\"modified\" meaning ....?. This is well outside the scope of the function list. It is best to use a dedicated plugin as suggested. . The tail feature is intentionally made to be a read only mode for viewing the file as it changes. . Monitoring is a separate feature from auto detection. The whole point of using the tail feature is to see the end of the file. . No clue what an mdf file is. Please provide more info if you want any hope of someone helping. . You need to report the issue to the author of the Plugin Manager. . What you are referencing is documentation for a plugin, not Notepad++ itself. I would contact the author of the plugin if something is not working for you.. Word documents are not plain text files. You should not edit them with Notepad++. . You have quite a few plugins installed so it's likely it could be one of those and not Notepad++. Try disabling them. . I don't ever recall this being natively supported by Notepad++. Can you provide a screenshot where it is working and post your debug info?.

As suggested, you can add it yourself.. Though some people might find it useful, it doesn't warrant shipping it as a default plugin in Notepad++. . @Predelnik. The plugin manager is not part of the Notepad++ project. This needs reported to the author of the Plugin Manager.. As suggested in the forum, this would need addressed by Scintilla and not Notepad++. You can completely rewrite Notepad++ if you want a native cross-platform implementation...but that would be crazy. \nYou can already run it on Linux with WINE. It seems like alot of the standard functions are there just glancing through. Honestly I'm not sure if its a good idea to include the Corona API since it is a specific framework.. Please post your debug info.. With so many plugins installed did you think maybe it could be caused by one of those?. As hinted at by me and pointed out by @cmeriaux it is caused by the BetterMultiSelection plugin. If there is a bug with it then report it to that project. . Your version is 6 years old.. Closed by 184a6f6ce5896440d93374e8ba8d7673fa877e8c. You'll have to be more specific. Such as how you are handling it and why you think you are not getting notified. Not sure what the image is for either.\nI did a test with LuaScript and it is able to handle the notifications of files being saved:\n\nDebug info:\nNotepad++ v7.6.2   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Jan  1 2019 - 00:00:08\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : ON\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 7 (64-bit)\nPlugins : DSpellCheck.dll LuaScript.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll NppLSP.dll. I may be incorrect, but I believe you'd want to put L_FORTRAN_77 right before L_EXTERNAL because this shifts all the enum values...which can cause havoc on plugins that use these, else all of them would have to be re-compiled.\n. Should this just be if (type == L_LESS || type == L_SCSS) or should they be setting different properties for each?\n. I changed the one buffer because the format string itself was bigger than the buffer. These two I left alone since they were fine. \n. Either \"capabilities\" or \"capability\" would be more appropriate. Also I prefer \"these\" vs \"those\". \n. Either \"up-to-date\" or \"updated\" would be fine, and \"your\" seems unneeded.\nThere are several other minor updates that should be made:\n\"Keep Notepad++ updated: Check this option to install an update module which searches for Notepad++ update_s_ on the Internet and install_s_ it for you.\"\nPersonally I find this sentence overly verbose. I prefer something like:\n\"Keep Notepad++ updated: Automatically download and install the latest updates.\"\n. Is this if/else block necessary (and subsequent checks when writing the parameter)? Can the pure enum value be stored instead?\nIf you take a look at the \"_autoCAction\" attribute in this file it uses its enum value.\n. I understand you just moved this function from PluginsManager.cpp but since everything else uses generic_strings personally I'd suggest going ahead and converting this function to use it. (I'm assuming this would be an easy change).\n. Personally I'd prefer this be more readable with another if statement.\n. Attempt -> attempt\nbelow command -> the command below\n. Forcing this upon a user isn't a good idea. They may well want numbers to be autocompleted. I have PR #2378 that does this exact same thing but allows the user to enable it or not.\n. This is an exact copy of the std::sort() call on line 120 and 376. You can probably put this into a separate function and would make the code a bit more readable, e.g. having a call to sortCaseInsensitive(...) or whatever.\n. This is inefficient because it always transforms the two strings even if _ignoreCase is false.\n. This does not work with VS 2013 (the official build system).\n. As the issues state, the property is not respected the first time the lexer is used. I can't say for certain I understand what is happening inside Scintilla, but from using my scripting plugin and poking around it seems that properties are cached, even when lexers are switched. This is why setting the lexer a 2nd (or 3rd, etc) time, the SQL lexer works correctly because the property is cached.\nAlso, in every other case in this file where SCI_SETPROPERTY is used, it is after the lexer is set.\n. This if block creates lots of copies of strings. Is there a better way to compare them? Can you use _tcsicmp()? If so could you also use it in AutoCompletion::sortKeyWords()?\n. No reason to have this public. \n. I did take a look at that. However that function is located under the deprecated API...and reading the documentation for it states:\n\nSHCreateDirectory is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions.\n\nIt did appear to work in my Win7 machine but I don't know if it works for Win8 or Win10...or how long into the future it will be supported.\n. That's really good to know! I'd much prefer to use SHCreateDirectory anyways. I'm never sure how serious to take the \"warnings\" from Microsoft about certain functions. I will update the PR when I get a chance.\nThanks!\n. I wasn't too worried about checking the return value since most other places in the code tend to ignore it as well. Plus if something does fail it most likely will cause CopyFile() to fail.\n. macroPlayback() is called from more than one location. When IDM_MACRO_PLAYBACKRECORDEDMACRO was triggered then _playingBackMacro was getting appropriately set so that SCN_CHARADDED was skipping auto-completion and auto-indentation. \nHowever the two other places macroPlayback() is called from did not set these flags. I figured it was safer to put these flags inside macroPlayback() instead of manually setting/unsetting them outside of it.\n. There seems to be a good bit of code duplication among these case statements (and in other parts of the file as well). I'm not sure how easy it would be to pull out this common functionality into a separate function(s).. It is probably worth changing the default constructor to call this method instead of duplicating the code.. Though technically not needed, this would be more readable as shortcut.clear();. Would a single call to _pEditView->execute(SCI_GRABFOCUS); work?. Good to know. It was just a thought.. This has a potential buffer overrun. See #3139 for a similar fix when using SCI_GETWORDCHARS. . It is recommend to use empty(). This can be made private.. Could this for and next if statement be condensed to:\nc\nif (charList.find(char2check) == string::npos)\n{\n    chars2addStr.push_back(char2check);\n}. Actually I think this entire for loop starting at line 64 could be replaced with something like:\nc\nsize_t pos = 0;\nwhile((pos = additionalWordChar.find_first_not_of(charList, pos)) != string::npos)\n{\n    chars2addStr.push_back(additionalWordChar[pos]);\n    pos++;\n}\nI'd suggest double checking this though to make sure it works as expected.. Ah I see what you mean. Is there some other form of isdigit() that would work? find_first_not_of() should work but a native function to check the character would probably be a bit more efficient and clearer...in the end shouldn't really matter though.. Would something as straight forward as iswdigit() work?. I don't think calling SCI_COLOURISE is a good idea because it forces the entire document to get re-lexed.. I'm honestly not sure. I ran a simple regex to find duplicate lines. I am planning on looking into this eventually if case matters. . Again just ran a regex to find duplicates next to each other so it doesn't work if the list isn't properly sorted.. Each parameter needs its own <Param> element. Console.SetWindowSize is already defined above.. The reason alot of these are not getting suggested is because you used keyWord instead of KeyWord. ",

C++style casts promise more security, so it is quite common to recommend them. However, in the real world, you still have to understand properly what you're doing and do not really protect against issues. It is not because your code compiles with a static_cast or a reinterpret_cast that it is correct anyway. Additionally the compiler (especially gcc and clang) may prevent the developer from making casts where it is required (reinterpret_cast is not always strictly equivalent to a c-style cast). Since, c++ style casts are not fully reliable, it can not become a strict rule. As a consequence, it becomes a matter of taste, thus C-style casts or C++style casts are fine to me. However, whatever the type of the cast, it has to be justified.\nPS: obviously, I am not talking about dynamic_cast or const_cast here. const_cast should not be used from my point of view, as it is often the symptom of a structural issue.\n. As said, nothing should stop you from using c++-style casts for new code if you prefer and if it compiles  :)\n. As said, nothing should stop you from using c++-style casts for new code\n. I will do it as soon as I can, probably within the week (sorry I was a bit busy somewhere else)\n. Git will not convert line endings if you don't ask for it (not configured for it). pull/push \"as it\" is probably the way to go, as it is done in so many projects and it is by personnal experience less error prone. If files are modified because of that, i would say that the issue may come from some bad habits (especially on windows) to perform nasty file convertions on the fly because some old editors were not able to handle such cases. I understand however this can be handy in some situations, but it is probably a different point of view for a different scenario.\nAnyway, whatever the personnal feelings or the state of the repository are, a PR is obviously not the appropriate way for this kind of changes. You can not say \"hurry up take my changes !\". I am quite confident you would not do it IRL.

The issue the guy had was that he was performing FindInFiles on remote machine (network share) and if there were problems with the network connection the find operation stalled without showing anything. That is because N++ was trying to make the list of the remote files to search and it was waiting for the network timeout but during this search step N++ doesn't show anything (looks like app hang to the user). Only after the list is created the actual search progress appears.\n@milipili , The idea is not to show the actual remote files list creation progress - no percentage is shown during this step. During this step the progress window only gives information on the remote directory being checked for files to search (which is the only information the user actually gets about the search status) and it also gives the user a chance to cancel the find operation during this stage (which might be very time consuming if there are network problems).\nThis is to justify the need from this patch, It's up to you guys to decide whether it's worth merging.\n\u2015\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. A bug is a problem encountered by the user. The label \"enhancement\" can be seen as something more generic.\n\nHowever, as explained in #207, this issue will be closed and reused for upcoming changes.\n. Thanks for all those opened issues to improve the code quality of n++. However, since we have to see the \"big\" picture, a major code refactoring is currently underway. And because of this refactoring, the issues will be marked as \"won't fix\" (to easily find them). Not because they must not be fixed, but because we prefer to spend the short time we have to provide a more appropriate architecture as quickly as possible for upcoming features.\n. First, we should improve the codebase to simplify the development and to provide more code isolation and flexibility. Then it will be easier to add new features requested by users.\nOne possible way of improvement is for example using concurrency, for better ui responsiveness and better efficiency \n. And robustness too.\n. No need for a second issue :)\n. Are you sure about the file encoding ?\n. UTF-8 should be used.\n. From now on, only utf-8 is accepted for translations (and for simple translation updates please provide a single commit). If it does not work for some reasons, please fill up a bug report\n. From my point of view, you should wait before spending too much time on this. As soon as it compiles with cmake there will have several incompatible changes and this code in the current state won't be isolated enough.\n. The compilation with cmake is on-going and should be here soon. For the rest I don't know.\n. all files will be progressively rewritten then moved to a new folder.\n. Indeed the timezone is not taken into consideration. To avoid that n++ should work with UTC timestamps.\n792 show the way to fix the problem, even if I don't think that calling _tzset each time is the best way to fix that.\n. I don't think you want that n++ spends its time performing checksums, especially when the opened files are big. However, n++ should definitively take the timezone into consideration when comparing timestamps. It does not matter if the timestamp is correct or not for the filename, the only thing that matters is that it has changed or not.. No it is too early.

This may be too restrictive, but some boundaries must be defined.\nAs a consequence, like many other softwares, a patch (PR in this case) for fixing a bug must be as minimal as possible and must strictly fix it. Simply for being easily back-ported in previous versions (even if n++ does not currently exactly use semver nor LTS version). Thus no coding style change nor indentation nor etc can be accepted.\nObviously, any problem must be reported. It is an important knowledge base and even if some issues are closed for some reasons, it is important to have them (but duplicates should be avoided of course)\nWhenever there is doubt for a new feature or for some enhancements, a question can be asked (in github, an issue can be a question) before coding something that may not fit or may be useless (again, like any other project). And we would be glad to answer it as soon as possible to find a solution together.\nIt is sometimes difficult to share a vision, but in any cases it is mandatory to keep a direction. When contributing, personal tastes are important, but they must remain personal. They will be followed anyway if they seems good.\nAbout updating the contributing.md, I will let @donho answer :)\n. We will try something very simple. Except for translation and user documentation (which should be coming soon), a PR can be accepted only if attached to a github issue (bug, enhancement, question). For enhancement and questions, it must be approved by one of the administrators, via the new label \"accepted\". If an issue is still not accepted, anyone who wants to take the job can ask for it of course.\nLike that, anyone would be able to specify the wanted changes and implementation details can be discussed, and useless work should be avoided.\n. AFAIK, any contribution falls under the project's copyright\n. This sounds good to me.\n. There won't be never ending quabbles. A PR for not being rejected must now be related to an issue, which must be accepted first if not for resolving a bug (and we will do the code review anyway). \n. Sorry guys I will close this PR. The 6.x is somehow frozen and we would like to revamp some code in the 7.x. However, as already stated in other issues, this will be labeled as \"won't fix\" to keep all fixes in the same place.\n. I reopen the issue to keep the conversation active since questions have been asked\n. From my point of view, I would prefer a description to reproduce the bug.\n. With another font ?\n. Proposing a list of invalid plugins with checkboxes before performing the action might be a solution.\n. Gitter may seem a good place for that in a first time.\n. Why did you close it ? vsixmanifest should not be added as xml ?\n. Nice feature indeed. I want it :) However, it implies the search understand the underlying format and its changes the code architecture. Hum very interesting actually. I like it \n. No, but as I said, this implies to have understand the underlying language (for c++ for example, to use libclang to really parse the c++ file) but it would be nice for the function list as well.\n. I don't know if it is possible, but please create another issue for that.\n. @GitMensch Is this PR ready or something else is needed ?\n. You would prefer 2 weeks ? :) If you're talking about syntax highlighting, you can propose an User Defined Language file.\n. Please submit a PR or propose an existing configuration for that (feel free to reopen this issue if you have some good links)\n. Maybe a mockup of your idea would help indeed.\n. Sorry for the inconvenience. We were experimenting some new features. Even if it were for a very short time, you may have this issue. But it should be fine now ?\n. It is something like that yes. I have opened the task #307 for that\n. oki but this would require different issues.\n. This cleanup will be done in the upcoming 7.x branch. We're also considering alternatives to XML. Thus :\n- We stay with the way things are now in the current stable release 6.x\n- We can make things differently in 7.x, continuing with XML (but in utf-8 of course) or using something else, like json for example for its simplicity. But, unless some major bug exists, other things must be done first before modifying this part.\n. @keith-collyer still the issue ? The font has been modified in the last versions\n. +1\n. Suspicious content to check:\n- [ ] aragonese.xml\n. Sorry for the invalid commit\n. Please provide a single commit for this kind of things\n. see #176 \n. There is no need for several commits here. Please make a single commit\n. Do not worry for this time we will do it :)\n. Thank you\n. Is this related to #216  ?\n. It should work in the next release. See #336 \n. We're thinking about it. But some work must be done before that.\n. Scintilla is only one part of the project.\n. Only complaining as always :)\n. Cross-platform is somehow in the roadmap. However it requires a few modifications in the code architecture to allow a real start of the project on other platforms.\n. There is no need to keep this issue opened since it is a global task and it will be part of the refactoring. From now on, cross-platform is required in any new code.\n. Using an external program is kinda the same than initially proposed by @jonandr. But I like the idea of embedding it. On the other hand, I am not sure about antivirus/IDS tools concerning an executable with elevated permissions from nowhere (most probably from the temp folder).\nMy initial thoughts was using a special command line argument indeed (but without loading the universe). @jonandr had some concerns about security issue, even if I do not really see which one exactly, but I may miss something.\n. Self elevation (with specific flags in some cases) is a common pattern even for MS programs. It is even part of their samples (https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/CppUACSelfElevation-5bfc52dd)\nSecurity issue is not the same thing as bug. If the command-line parser is buggy, it is likely that the feature will just not work and it would be quite visible. Anyway a complete implementation would require more than that. It requires both read and write capabilities (and monitoring about external file modifications). So in both cases the process will be able to do some nasty things.\nActually I am not against this method. The COM Elevation Moniker is not suitable for me anyway. So as long as the programs are signed (we want code signing) and easily identifiable by the user, I don't really care if they are two separate program files or not.\nBTW, how other editors do ?\n. Do not worry @ariccio, I perfectly understand. Please stop with all your \"massive\" or equivalent words and your links associated to it like that. I don't know if you're taking use for idiots but this way of writing becomes really irritating.\nWhen we speak about bugs, it means problems for the user (aka crash). Of course a security issue is something to fix. We can call them security bugs if you want to make a proper distinction. But talking about pointer arithmetic issues in a command line parser is the least of the problems here (that do not mean to not take into consideration that a problem may arise, to the contrary).\nThat said, back to business, let's go deeper with this method and how it should work. I will assume that n++ is not able to read/write/access/whatever to a given file.\nWith the proposed architecture (aka a second process), it seems obvious how to read the content and how to modify it. However we should answer to the following questions:\n- Applying the changes in copying an intermediate file itself does not really please me. Generating intermediate IO access can be seen as a waste (with anti-virus working behind the scene and especially for medium/large files on network shares) but my primary and probably only concern is to ensure that the original metadata and/or ACL, especially on a Windows Server, are preserved. I would probably prefer that this subprocess handles the changes directly\n- What is the lifespan of the sub process : re-exec it for each action (thus always asking a confirmation from the user) or keep it opened for a while with an idle timeout ? (like sudo, and what should be the value of the timeout : 15 min like sudo ?)\n- How do we handle external changes ? The subprocess (if always alive) may handle it. Or should we detect it only before writing it and ask for a confirmation ?\n. And again it would be nice to have a comparison with other tools\n. @LPology I am not able to reproduce it. Is it still happening ?\n. I like the \"Show all characters\"\n. see 5e240147c51b6c27f1accbcfa191d9ddc4967e68. If this modification does not suit you, feel free to re-open this issue.\n. Hum... I don't really know... Bug or question ? :+1: \n. You're right about it. Sorry but as previously said, this kind of issue will be temporarily labelled as \"won't fix\"\n. You're right. The discussion might not have been seen by everyone. It is not that the code does not require some cleanup. The code base needs some refactoring to evolve. Somehow the current code base is frozen. As said in other issues, this issue is labelled as \"won't fix\" to be easily found when we will work on that part. See #217\n. It is certainly not a failure in accepting smaller commits. Smaller commits won't improve the global code architecture and won't really change anything from the project point-of-view. We only want to take some time to upgrade the global structure to make sure that the project will continue to grow and that it will continue to be a good alternative to other editors. This kind of changes is certainly not something that can be done by 50 people with 50 way of thinking radically different. I understand your frustation, however it will only be a waste of time for everyone (taken on our free time). That's why the current code base is somehow frozen.\nIn the new code, PR should not be a problem from my point of view even at the begining (a new folder src will come, and the code will be rewritten piece by piece). And we will try to provide \"roadmap\" issues to explain the ongoing work.\nI am sure that you will understand.\n. Indeed. No patch will be accepted (unless it solves a bug obviously). However thanks for reporting it these issues will be kept as a reminder.\n. If Google Drive crashes, it is not the fault of notepad++, it is a bug for Google Drive. However we would have to check if n++ really uses this file (and not that this file is used by the system open dialog for example).\nAnyway, AFAIK, the \"settings on Cloud\" will be removed by a more simpler method.\n. Indeed.\n. @ariccio We don't care here of a crash of Google Drive. I agree that n++ should not keep a lock for some reasons on an external file.\nAFAIK maintaining this kind of feature is kinda hard. These products always break the API and we always have to catch up, which is really annoying for users. Anyway since n++ only uses local files on a mounted remote folder, be able to simply select a target folder is probably more efficient and quite less error-prone.\n. See 5e240147c51b6c27f1accbcfa191d9ddc4967e68\n. It is not far from working. I will finish next week when i will be back\n\nOn 26 Jul 2015, at 21:03, NN notifications@github.com wrote:\nAny progress about cmake ?\n\u2015\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Sorry i reopen the issue since the problem is still not resolved in the n++ source code.\n. Just to remind you that we will likely switch to cmake\n. From my point of view, it is quite useless but I don't see any reasons to not do it. But not from the installer. It can be available like other downloads.\n. I am considering an automatic build .

It works for me (Windows 10, from a fresh install). Can you try to disable your plugins and then if the problem persists, publish a little screencast of the issue ?\n. For performance no, but probably the most appropriate value for the most users.\n. Encodings are detected and not written whitin the file. Could you attach a file encoded in win-1251 which is detected in iso-8859-8 ?\n. Could you attach a text file (or part of it) in the current issue to reproduce the bug ? (the file provided in NodeBB is a .bin file for me)\n. TextEdit (MacOS 10.7) seems to have the same problem (but not vim):\n\n. Could you provide a little screenshot ? :)\n. Could you provide a text file for reproducing the bug ?\n. Do not worry, I would have reopened it otherwise :)\n.

For commits, the rule that I would like to follow is \"a commit for a single thing\", so that the history can be read easily. As a second though, since it can be difficult sometimes to choose, several commits should always be fine now since the merge from github will be no longer used and it is easy to squash the commits if needed.\n.

Do you know if your proxy requires some authentication ?

Any url with ; or other characters added here, like &amp; for example, which is often used in urls\n. A tab-switcher with incremental search would be indeed more effective\n. People, give your ideas !\n. Feel free to propose a PR. Or you can list here the exhaustive list of the missing keywords we would add them.\n. I am closing the issue not because we don't want the feature but because we're trying to clean up a bit all those those issues. But you're are free to continue to comment on this issue.\nTo answer to your questions (same for linux) it requires a complete rewrite of the interface code, which is not that simple. But anyway just rewriting the C++ code would be inefficient, a plugin approach would be far better (and not native C plugins), to make n++ more flexible to user specific workflow. This is our direction right now and we will try to be transparent. We will see with Don what we can do about that.\n. https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2016-3705\n. lol I will see what can I do :)\n. For AppVeyor, probably a temporary failure, but nothing to do with this PR. About the conflicts, some changes have already been made (and coding style updated). See the attached diff file\n. See PR\n. see #897, pr #2003 \n. Agree with you. But as stated in the contributing guide, we will see that later (thus label \"wontfix\" to find it later)\n. See contributing guide\n. Could you describe what you did to reproduce the problem ?\n. It makes sense to have n++ on macOS and Linux, but on iPhone not really sure. iPad maybe... But anyway it would be better to target those platforms before anything else.\n. Natural Sort Order\n. Is it really the parent folder you want ? PROGRAM_FILES would not be better ?\n. Seems very vague to me (and very suspicious)... Please re-open this issue and provide proper documentation.\nnote: Why a docx here ? I have removed since it I don't really know what it can do for Windows users. And according to LibreOffice there is no reason to use a docx here.\n. We do not use github for merging PR since it creates a shitty history. commit --amend has nothing to do with that, it does not change the author by default. It does not seem that you did something wrong at a first glance. Should probably take a look at your configuration and your aliases, or since the diff are different, a mix with something else\n. As said commit --amend preserves the author. We do that for a long time and I do the same on some other projects.\nJust in case I reproduced the procedure with my account\n\nHowever, as you noticed, some changes do not come from your PR, hence I suspect some mix up with another commit (or other changes) :) Too much wine @donho ! :D\n. @donho: Next time, if you want to check, you may ask git log (or any other pretty log printer) before pushing anything. It will show you the author of the commit (there is a difference between the author of the commit, and the author of the push). In this case you would be able to rollback.\nExample from the previous test (with a fancy pretty printer):\n\n. The problem here is not directly n++, but the installer NSIS\n. Just for reference: Prevent DLL Hijacking Burn with Clean Room\n. @evoskuil So what ? You can replace any dll and get the same results. So could you kindly explain with more details what I am missing here ?. Ok, fair enough :). yes it is, sorry. just currently focused on something else.\n. It seems that I can't mark the requested changes as done. So doing it here (and rebased from master). @chcg That's why I asked to rebase :). @chcg Well since infinitely useful for code review and for other tools such as git bisect, I would strongly recommend to do it... However it seems that @donho does not really mind for now, you can probably ignore that one. But please rebase.. @MAPJe71 From my point of view and from my experience, unlocking a mutex in the middle of the code where it is supposed to be managed by the scope is far from a good idea. Like deleting some resource managed by unique_ptr. For this reason, it is unlikely that an unlock mecanism comes in libyuni, better fix the code with proper raii (but feel free to bring some particular use-case).\nRegarding libyuni/mutex, this is historical reason as std::mutex didn't exist before as you can guess. As of now, as the official minimum version for n++ is 2015 (if not mistaken, would be better to switch to 2017 from my point of view, there is a better support for multithread and brings multiple fixes), I would recommend to replace yuni/mutex by its stl counterpart as there is no added value.\nThat's said, it is right here to use yuni/mutex here, for code consistency. That replacement has nothing to do with this MR and should be another one.. @d0vgan I would encourage you next time to use multiple commits as it changes different things.. @MAPJe71 Where did you find the snippet you posted regarding CThreadSafeQueue? I am surely missing something here as I can't find the unlock() . @donho For information, libyuni is going full C++17, so Yuni::Mutexshould disappear in the future (depending if users are still using it or not). Ah yes right. Inheriting from std::list.... Just kill it with fire. Twice :). @donho This class CThreadSafeQueue should die, or at least rewritten. No one must inherit from any stl container, as specified by the standard. Better use encapsulation instead of inheritance anyway.. ATL dependency is really annoying. Nice job :). You should probably stop using this term too...\n. Please keep the old style.\n. Idem here\n. We don't care of std::regex here. Maybe in a developer's FAQ\n. You may want to say Unicode Debug configuration ?\n. Maybe we could add here: depends on ScopLexer.dll form the Scintilla project.\n. I don't have any preferences for that. It was just for h1 and h2 tags. And ~80 columns in the same time if possible.\n. The yuni library does never throw. If it does, it is a bug.\n. Ok that's enough @ariccio. I can not let you say this kind of things. We are not hostile to code cleanup and certainly not to refactoring since it is the current direction. It is because of the current refactoring that we can not accept all PR. I know, it takes time, but we do what we can. I think that you would already have understood that. You disagree with our methods and I understand that and maybe we're wrong. However, I don't know what you're looking for, but please calm down a bit...\n. oh sorry. this warning comes from the cmake build, not from the current VS project.\n. Because potentially allocating 32k on the stack is probably not a good idea. MS tries to fix their crap in their API and the real limit of a path is 32k. So this value may change in the future and there is no good reason to use a static buffer for a path.\n(but this has nothing to do with this commit, so it should be a separate commit)\n. This should be another commit. First commit for adding the missing namespaces, then another for enabling those namespaces.. isInList does not do what it says. You expect something immutable, not something that will change the content of the input. In that regard, this function is badly named.. Oh indeed.. Please see the commit message:\nprocess: add missing include Common.h (generic_string)\nThis include is required for the typedef generic_string.. ",
    "mat-m": "@milipili: that would be great, but should be in another request :)\n. @c33s : you mean like considering the filename as an extension and being allowed to say 'Vagrantfile' in the ruby extensions list ?\n. Truncating could be annoying when the end of the filename is meaningful. NetBeans, Visual Studio are IDEs and do not truncate.\nFWIW, I use the \"Multi-line\" setting, and I love it. When it is even too cluttered, I resort to the \"doc switcher\" plugin.\n. The HereDoc marker is usually defined with no space between the angle brackets and the end-of-text marker. \nMaybe npp could add some logic to consider a << sign between (( )) as a bitwise rather than a Heredoc redirect. Else, the only way for it to detect the two cases is to always add a space when using the bitwise left-shift. \n. Yeas, I thought so and prove myself wrong.\nApologies.\n. Sorry it took a long time.\nThis had no effect to powershell function detection. The list is still empty.\nIs there a cache to clear or a setting to update or something like that ?\n.

Sorry it took a long time.\nThis had no effect to bash function parsing, I still have the same results as in the screenshot. \nIs there a cache to clear or something like that ?\n.

I don't know how to say this using the regexes.\n. @MAPJe71 If I understand the code, the function list only uses the functionName block. I think it misses the anchor to begin of line (modulo indentation). Anyone trying to begin a function after a semi-colon does not deserve his function to be listed :-)\nI will try to play with it.\n. Perfect !\nThank you for this.\nIt will help me greatly.\n. @MAPJe71 : do you plan to submit a pull request for that & #2317 ?\n. @pingpong2011 : that was not the point.

You do have better security and if you need more you can do it easily.\nAlso you can make user defined casts with similar syntax , for instance you can write safe_reinterpret_cast which check what size of To and From are the same.\nC=style cast is loose cast, it tries static_cast, reinterpret_cast and then const_cast with reinterpret_cast.\nUsing C++-style cast you do it explicitly thus making intentions more clear.\nTake a following example: https://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/pull/142/files\nWith C-style cast you do not have any warning but you definitely have a bug.\nWith static_cast you get an error:  'static_cast': cannot convert from 'DWORD (__cdecl *)(LPVOID)' to 'LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE' !\n.

Actually it is Scintilla bug.\nDoes Notepad++ maintains its own fork of Scintilla ?\n. You can try on your own machine.\nThe previous setting was just wrong.\nIt actually compiled each file as precompiled header !\nIn that situation even removing it would lead to faster building time.\nI didn't measure but now I am able to build without need of switching to other application.\n. Release build\nBefore: 3:30\nAfter: 1:02\n. #pragma once is the best solution for this.\n.\nBut it deserves another PR.\n. @rcdailey Currently Notepad++ does use precompiled headers and I want to make the usage correct.\nPrecompiled headers are used for faster builds and it has mostly standard headers.\nI do agree that you can make some abuse and forget to include headers in the correct order.\nIt is not hard to add explicit includes in the needed places.\n\nNotepad++ is not portable anyway , so #pragma once is not a problem. :)\nIt doesn't fix repetitive includes but it makes second include as no-op.\nMoreover all compilers today support #pragma once.\nTo make it portable it is easy:\n```\nif VC or GCC or ICC or CLANG\npragma once\nendif\n```\n. Can you merge this PR because it takes too much time for to compile ? After then we will discuss how to speed up compilation.\n. @rcdailey include guards are not the same as #pragma once.\nPragma once doesn't allow you to check whether file was included by checking include guard definition.\nInclude guards don't optimize multiple include of the same file (whether directly or indirectly).\nYou must use both .\n. I did measurements and VC compiles faster with pragma once.\nI didn't measure VC2013 but I doubt it changed.\nSame for precompiled headers. They do speed up compilation if you use them correctly.\nI don't see any reason why not to use both.\nPrecompiled headers have only non modifiable includes like standard library so you don't really mess with dependencies .\nI want this PR merged to create new ones easier. 3 minutes of compilation time is too much when after this change I get 1 minute.\nI am not against your proposal but yours is a long term solution while mine is a short term until you measure all possibilities and propose the one with best compilation times.\nI do encourage you to measure with pragma once as well to see whether it helps or makes compilation time worse.\nThanks.\n. Closing.\nUse #90 \n. Confirm this bug.\n. I compiled Scintilla from latest revision source without any change and everything is working.\n. Another reasons for update.\nThe latest Scintilla doesn't have dependency on boost anymore ( #118 )\nAnd it has a vcxproj file for easier compiling ( https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/code/ci/default/tree/win32/ ) making it possible to have a solution with project reference.\n. And it is x64 build ready.\nActually Scintilla must be updated for 64-bit build.\n. I see. So basically Notepad++ has an unmaintained fork of Scintiilla. Very sad:(\nThis issue blocks #64\n. @donho Glad to hear!\nMaybe you should propose pull requests to the main repository ?\nAlso it will be good to have a normal fork in sorceforge.\nIt is going to be easier maintaining and updating.\nAnd since it has a project file you should really make a simple solution with both projects and reference.\nAdd sln file to repo back.\nNot sure, I think if you ignore it then file will be tere but nobody will commit any changes\n. @donho What about making Scintilla extendable and remove the need of modifying sources ?\nI see that you changed CreateRegexSearch function to return BoostRegex matcher.\nIf Scintilla had an extendibility point such as:\n``` cpp\ntypedef function RegexSearchFactory;\nRegexSearchBase CreateRegexSearch(CharClassify charClassTable) {\n    return new BuiltinRegex(charClassTable);\n}\n// Default value\nRegexSearchFactory globaRegexSearchFactory = CreateRegexSearch(;\nSetRegexSearchFactory(RegexSearchFactory factory)\n{\n  globaRegexSearchFactory = factory;\n}\nRegexSearchBase CreateRegexSearch(CharClassify charClassTable)\n{\n    return globalRegexSearchFactory(charClassTable);\n}\n```\nThen in Notepad++ you could just call SetRegexSearchFactory(BoostRegexSearch) .\nAnother possibility is to split Scintilla into two libs one with external implementation of CreateRegexSearch and the second includes the first with the implementation.\nNotepad++ could provide its own implementation.\nI think it is even easier to do then changing the code.\nIt makes easier updates of Scintilla.\n. @andreas-jonsson +1\nA needed feature !\n. Please restore the runtime /MT , otherwise people must install VC redistributable and it is painful.\n. Why ? What Dynamic runtime gives you over static?\nIt doesn't add performance or make less bugs, but it does make installer complex and management of runtimes.\n. I am familiar with advantages and disadvantages.\nThe question what we solve with that.\nI don't see currently any problem with static linking.\nUpdates to runtime are for good and for bad, sometimes small behavior changes and program breaks:)\nIt will definitely make installer bigger about by 3MB (if I remember correctly this is size of redistributable) and with 64bit it will add another ones.\n. My measurements for Release build.\nPCH: 1:10\nMultiprocess: 1:20\nIt is still much better then before :)\n. There are no tons of includes in the project.\nActually, in Windows PCH helps because you almost always includes windows.h and it is a very large include file.\n. Okay :)\nI am closing my PR and waiting for this to be merged.\n. Why not ?\nJust go to menu and enable multiprocess build.\nIt doesn't say me that it can't do it.\n. It is just interesting to see whether PCH with MP have a noticeable difference.\n. Oh, you are right :)\nMissed that.\n. This file shouldn't be in the repository.\nPut it on symbols server with the source and then you can debug without checking out .\nFor instance this site provides the service: http://www.symbolsource.org/\nYou put there sources with all pdbs for the release version and then anyone can add the server to symbols path .\n. ave also github large files git extension for storing binary files like this one.\n. I think it is pretty obvious what the PR does.\n. I can do it later .\nI think merge will have the same effect .\n. Fixed conflict.\n. You're welcome\n. +1 !\n. With the removing of vs2005.vcproj please close this issue.\n. There is also PVS Studio which analyzed Notepad++ a long time ago.\nhttp://www.viva64.com/en/b/0131/#ID0EOAAG\nBut it costs a lot of money , maybe they have some special license for open source projects.\nThe point of static analyzer is not running it once for the old code but rather running it always for the better new code.\nhttp://www.viva64.com/en/d/0218/\n. It has now conflicts.\nPlease update the PR.\n. Merge conflicts :(\n. I think this should move to milestone 7 with the #178\n. Why not NuGet ?\nIMO it is much easier to use it and you don't need any scripts nor to compiler it.\n. http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html\n\"When using a C++11 compliant compiler and runtime, it may be possible to use the runtime's implementation of  by compiling Scintilla with CXX11_REGEX defined\"\nBasically it means that using Scintilla with standard regular expression can be sufficient.\n.

Just to notice there is a NuGet package for TinyXML2: https://www.nuget.org/packages/tinyxml2/\n. No conflicts :)\n. Interesting , I guess you are right.\nIn any case it is essential for 64bit.\n.

I am working on it, see: #64 \nIn order to have x64 build the Scintilla must be updated , it is the essential part.\nIf you wish you can help me :)\n. @donho \nScintilla is x64 ready, so no 64-bit changes.\nIt can use C++11 regex , if you see it is sufficient , then we don't need boost and the compiler has everything for x64 too.\nI don't think there are big changes except that, hope so :)\nI am going to do merge requests to make less change specifically for Notepad++ (For instance  https://sourceforge.net/u/nn-n/scintilla/ci/npp_styles/ )\nUnfortunately I don't see any answers for any merge request there, so I guess you have to fork the repository on sorceforge and put here the working copy manually or using git-hg (cause it is in mercurial) .\nThat way it will be easy to update and to maintain changes, just to rebase over the original version.\n. I have read about std::regex and it is not PCRE.\nIt means that you do need boost::regex .\nAlthough I prefer as less as possible changes to scintilla.\nFor instance boost regex macher can be done in a separate lib and linked\nwith scintilla compiled with special define to not implement its own regex.\nThe additional defines can be in a different file and so on.\nIn short I think time for solution file.\nWith projects n++ , scintilla and scintilla additions.\nWhat about moving to VS2015 as it is free and has xp support like 2013\nwhile many C++ bugs are fixed.\nIt has more good warnings .\nAnother question for unittests, what do you think?\nMy opinion that the easiest framework is CxxTest, it requires little work\nand easier to use than other frameworks.\nOn \u0412\u0441, 7 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 2015 at 18:14 Don HO notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@NN--- https://github.com/NN--- I'm gonna download Scintilla source of\nRelease 3.5.6 from:\nhttp://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDownload.html\nAdapted and integrated into Notepad++ for next release.\nSo you can continue your 64 bits task.\nFor C++11 regex, I'm not against it if it is compatible PCRE, then it will\nbe in future versions.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/162#issuecomment-109764091\n.\n. @donho Please accept this PR , without it Notepad++ hangs all the time.\n.

Do they know about this issue ?\nMaybe some profiling is needed there.. Cast is a small fix for small problem.\nI think the big change is not necessary at this point.\nYour patch is a good one, you should propose it as a pull request and in your pull request use better replacement fro this API :)\nI can do that, and then all nasty part is hidden from the usage.\nBut I don't think it is required in this particular PR.\ncpp\n// Wrap CharUpper with cleaner interface\nwchar_t MakeCharUpper(wchar_t c)\n{\n  return (wchar_t)(UINT_PTR)CharUpper((LPWSTR)c);\n}\n.

See #765 \n. see #333, will be done by donho\n. See #162, about the drawback of C++11 std::regex. Perl syntax is available with boost, but not with c++11, just ecma script notation (see http://www.regular-expressions.info/stdregex.html)\nIt is possible to use c++11 regex, if boost is replaced with std in\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/scintilla/boostregex/BoostRegExSearch.cxx\nand some smaller adaptions.\n, see also https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb982727.aspx and\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5047971/how-do-i-check-for-c11-support\n.

Related to  #215, regarding the issue that changing the timezone triggers a reload.\n. Or @mrpapercut could also close this.. Appveyor issue seems to be caused by a boost download issue, maybe not by the code change:\nRunning Install scripts\nInvoke-WebRequest -OutFile boost_1_55_0.7z -UserAgent Wget/1.17.1 https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/boost_1_55_0.7z\n7z x boost_1_55_0.7z 2>nul >nul\nCommand exited with code 2 \nMaybe relevant to find the root cause of the crashes for #1835 and #1843\n. See x64 release boost path:\nlink -OPT:REF -LTCG -DEBUG -LIBPATH:C:\\projects\\notepad-plus-plus\\boost_1_55_0\\bin.v2\\libs\\regex\\build\\msvc-12.0\\release\\architecture-ia64\\link-static\\runtime-link-static\\threading-multi -DEF:Scintilla.def ...\nvs: x64 debug:\nlink  -OPT:REF -LTCG -DEBUG -LIBPATH:C:\\projects\\notepad-plus-plus\\boost_1_55_0\\bin.v2\\libs\\regex\\build\\msvc-12.0\\debug\\link-static\\runtime-link-static\\threading-multi -DEF:Scintilla.def ...\n, so architecture-ia64 is missing, see root cause assumption in 5a5582b\n. added PR #2062 to fix the x64 debug build\n. This might be a duplicate of #1087 (Do not switch tab on file modification).\nand another dup: #3160 focusing on changed file issue. @donho I don't see such an issue, but I had to removed boostpath.mak from previous boost build otherwise the build always try to link against boost libs. nppSpecifics.mak just falls back to noboost, if boostpath.mak is not found. Could this be the issue you are facing? \nOtherwise could you send me the error output.\nIt is a little bit inconvenient that the scintilla build result is always just under bin and clean has to be called before changing between release and debug and x86 and x64. Using SciLexer.vcxproj in a combined solution with N++ makes building the 4 variants much easier.\n. @donho  Rebuild of this change with updated appveyor config using NOBOOST=1 shows no issues for all 4 combinations (x86 and x64, debug and release) under VS 2013.\nObviously this new appveyor config no longer checks the intended change for the case with boost.\nAt least the test for x86 release was ok with the first commit, see https://ci.appveyor.com/project/donho/notepad-plus-plus/build/1.0.215\n. Close this one. Use #2336 \n. This is probably the wrong place to fix this issue. As the scintilla component is taken from http://www.scintilla.org, the issue should be reported there. Currently N++ uses the older version 3.5.6. \n. Can't reproduce either with:\nNotepad++ v6.9.2\nBuild time : May 18 2016 - 00:34:05\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10\nPlugins : AnalysePlugin.dll DSpellCheck.dll mimeTools.dll NppCCompletionPlugin.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll NppFTP.dll NppTextFX.dll PluginManager.dll SpeechPlugin.dll Translate.dll \n. Can't reproduce the issue with N++ 7.6 on Win10. No difference between number block or numbers keys.\nThe beep sound is just hearable, if a invalid the user tries to input some invalid number like e.g. a double digit like 34. Additionally a popup appears if you try to input no digit.. See https://www.appveyor.com/docs/installed-software/#languages-libraries-frameworks:\nBoost:\n1.62.0 (C:\\Libraries\\boost_1_62_0)\n1.60.0 (C:\\Libraries\\boost_1_60_0)\n1.59.0 (C:\\Libraries\\boost_1_59_0)\n1.58.0 (C:\\Libraries\\boost_1_58_0)\n1.56.0 (C:\\Libraries\\boost)\n, maybe we could readd the build of scintilla with boost with one of this preinstalled boost versions to appveyor config and don't suffer from the wget issue we saw in the past, also changes to scintilla are quite seldom. But this would enforce an update from currently used boost 1.55.0 to a newer one. \n. @MAPJe71  Build break probably caused by usage of older appveyor image\nimage: Visual Studio 2013\nwhich is not updated like the current one Visual Studio 2015\n. @MAPJe71 \ncheck the appveyor builds, the config for scintilla is interchanged between debug and release.\nRelease has set:\nNPP_SCINTILLA_CONFIG=DEBUG=1\nDebug not.\nI ran the x64 release build from the appveyor artifacts and they seems to be ok.\n. @donho Any chance to get this resurrected and integrated? What needs to be done from your point of view? I see:\n- cleanup into one commit\n- maybe avoid appveyor config changes, but create an appveyor branch build which shows that also the build with boost is ok\nAny thoughs about the topics:\n- usage of vs2015\n- updateboost  from n++ version 1.55 to current 1.63\n- update of scintilla, see e.g. https://github.com/cmeriaux/scintilla/commits/npp-3-7-0\nSee upcoming http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_64_0.html regarding regex:\n\nBig effort to de-fuzz the library using libFuzzer and fix identified issues, see: #12818. \n\nand the corresponding bugticket:\nhttps://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12818\n,which contain many probably security related issues.\n. With N++ 7.6 the replacement PluginAdmin is available see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.6-released.html. Do you think it is also possible to automatically fix some classes of issues by a script?\n.

See https://compfreakstars.blogspot.de/2011/11/0xc0000005-error-every-day-many.html, could have plenty of root causes. Does this just happen with n++?\nDo you have visual studio installed and could run it with the debugger connected? Our might run a debug build?. Still reproducible with 7.5.4. The problematic part is:\nvoid cutString(const TCHAR* str2cut, vector<generic_string>& patternVect)\n{\n    TCHAR str2scan[MAX_PATH];\n    lstrcpy(str2scan, str2cut);\nstr2cut is the ext string without limit and therefore lstrcpy() overwrites the buffer str2scan with 260 elements. So one fix is using lstrcpyn (see https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/windows/desktop/ms647491(v=vs.85).aspx). Original discussion see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/13027/notepad-url-processing-cyrillic-symbols/17. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14315/notepad-7-5-release, PluginManager is no longer part of N++. https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/issues is the place to report the problem.. Please check/contribute to  #1247. On which type of file do you see it? \ncpp, xml, html, etc. or does it happen independent of the file type?\nHow much of the 80% cpu load is caused by n++?. Error code is STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN (0xc0000409), see e.g. https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2009/01/28/stack-overflow-stack-exhaustion-not-the-same-as-stack-buffer-overflow/. With WER and the pdb for the version a debug analysis would be possible, see https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/8103.application-crash-dump-analysis-windows-7.aspx.  @donho Are you storing the pdb files of your builds for such a coredump analysis?. @donho What do you think about correction of:\n    #define DOCSTAUS_READONLY 1\n    #define DOCSTAUS_BUFFERDIRTY 2\n\nwhich should be probably DOCSTATUS. Amended the commit with changes for DOCSTATUS. See \n[BUG_FIXED] (Author: Ivan Radi\u0107 - aka Loreia) UDL 2.1.\ndonho committed on 27 Jan 2013\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/d60466eed348e1d61577225fd260abeb5d061095#diff-ddbb1ae1c7d085bd1c35d143255d0f31\nCurrent version from https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/scintilla/include/SciLexer.h:\ndefine SCE_UDL_VERSION_MAJOR       2\ndefine SCE_UDL_VERSION_MINOR       1\ndefine SCE_UDL_VERSION_BUILD       0\ndefine SCE_UDL_VERSION_REVISION 12\n.

Should it be two commit within this PR or two PRs?. @donho Added again with a slight modification that SCI_NAMESPACE is added in a seperate step. Also adapted vcxproj file.. Current version with various fixes and x64 support is https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/releases/tag/v1.4.9, but will probably not be bundled with N++ anymore, according to donho.. Main reason the sponsorship advertisment (used to pay the server) on the PM window.. Current version with various fixes and x64 support is https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/releases/tag/v1.4.9, but will probably not be bundled with N++ anymore, according to donho.. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14315/notepad-7-5-release, PluginManager is no longer part of N++. https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/issues is the place to report the problem.. @coldev Could this issue be closed then?.  ALT + 2. mouse selection and\n (Alt + Shift) + 2. Arrow key  working fine and reliably from my point of view.. @sachinjegaonkar Would you like to provide a PR with your fix?. For optimizations and regression checks an output of the parser timing could help to identify problematic parsers.. See #2336 for a more intrusive, but also complete solution. See https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-environment/#build-worker-images, currently used image is Visual Studio 2013. Visual Studio 2015 is the standard for current projects and Visual Studio 2017 is slightly different as just VS2015 and VS2017 are supported.\nSee e.g. https://github.com/chcg/notepad-plus-plus/blob/mingw_gcc/appveyor.yml for a config which added VS2015. VS2017 is a little bit different as vcvarsall.bat is not placed under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 15.0\\VC\\, see https://github.com/chcg/NppToolBucket/blob/master/appveyor.yml. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14315/notepad-7-5-release, PluginManager is no longer part of N++. https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/issues is the place to report the problem. This one is fixed with version 1.4.9, which was never bundled with N++ deliveries.. With newer N++ versions there is a checkbox to the right of \"Find Next\" to toggle between the normal mode and the 2 button mode.. Relevant change part of https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/ef3ad5d90920439219265ca46fdb206918f1b86c. - 1, 2, 3, are fixed with https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/releases/tag/v1.4.9, but that version was never accepted to be bundled with N++. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14315/notepad-7-5-release, PluginManager is no longer part of N++. So the user has to update on his own.\n- 8, already reported as https://github.com/ashkulz/NppFTP/issues/171\n- 4, TextFX is outdated, see http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/TextFX's_Future\nas all this is just voluntary work, don't expect professional service.\nCleaning up all this N++ issues would be work for a full time ticket manager for quite some time, just to get them to a updated state, not talking about fixes.. See #3393. Still crashes with 7.5.4. On loading the mentioned text from some sample.m (UTF-8 encoded).\n(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/652186/why-do-objective-c-files-use-the-m-extension)\nInterestingly I just observe the crash for the 32bit version, but not for 64bit.\nch in Stylecontext is:\nint ch;\nprobably to take an unicode character, but isdigit() is just the plain char version, see \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/isdigit-iswdigit-isdigit-l-iswdigit-l\nwith\n\nThe behavior of isdigit and _isdigit_l is undefined if c is not EOF or in the range 0 through 0xFF, inclusive. When a debug CRT library is used and c is not one of these values, the functions raise an assertion. \n\nWhat we might face here. Seems to be unchanged up to scintilla trunk.\nDoesn't happen without \ud83d\udc47, so my current guess would be there is a problem with the UFT-8 encoding of this character, see https://codepoints.net/U+1F447?lang=en. This might be a duplicate of #1087 (Do not switch tab on file modification).\nand another dup: #3160 focusing on changed file issue. @MAPJe71 Maybe interesting for  #3393. @CookiePLMonster Yes this is a reimpl. Just didn't want to introduce big code changes without the ok from somebody who understands why it was done this way. See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/2c8d19sb.aspx, _tcstok is probably relevant and I'm not sure if compatibilty with Windows Runtime is a problem.. Close this one in favor of #4073 . Seems to be related to https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/675. https://notepad-plus-plus.org/update/getDownloadUrl.php returns:\n<GUP><NeedToBeUpdated>yes</NeedToBeUpdated><Version>7.5.4</Version><Location>http://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/7.x/7.5.4/npp.7.5.4.Installer.exe</Location></GUP>. @donho What do you think. As stated in CVE:\n\nThe GUP generic update process in Notepad++ before 4.8.1 does not properly verify the authenticity of updates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse update, as demonstrated by evilgrade and DNS cache poisoning.\n\nWas this fixed with N++ 4.8.1? Or did they just stop to evaluate it with newer releases?\nDo you have any objections against switching to https?\n. @dail8859 There is a merge option from github to \"squash and merge\", see https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/. @GitMensch See #2478 with just this changes the build still fails, due to ATL, which is not available for mingw. So adding an additional build for it just makes sense, if it is planned to get this build running, either by disabling the problematic code via #ifdef or by some stub similar to https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/1663. Maybe in the meantime also some new issues were introduced.\nTherefore some agreement from donho is needed what will be accepted.. @GitMensch See also #4776 for a probably functional version.. @CookiePLMonster \nSee  #2478 and #1663 as gcc issues warnings on this. Some of them handled in #3918, but already #1663 would have fixed a lot of them. As it never got merged they are still in the codebase.\nThe used scintilla version is 3.5.6 with n++ specific adaptations (see also #1655 #1656). So a newer scintilla might have fixed that already. . @Randoragon With which version of N++ do you use? A current one with the fix of #4611. @schnurlos You may want to check the german changes.. @d0vgan additional benefit: building with mingw would be possible again, because ATL is not available there, see  #4145 and there #2478 with patches to avoid ATL, see https://github.com/chcg/notepad-plus-plus/commit/463bdc5e1416a5f2ee256d7316ed49e4865a0171#diff-5b536d07367d39b369aea9582ff0fe9d\nwith\nstd::unique_lock<std::mutex> \nas replacement for\nCComCritSecLock<CComAutoCriticalSection>. @MIvanchev The main point to get ride of ATL I think is to be able to build this under mingw.. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history#Version_compatibility\nand (also in german) http://www.chip.de/downloads/Safari_27264736.html.\nLatest safari version for windows is 5.1.7 from 2012, also for Mac it is 11.1. So the advice is not to install it any more due to security risks.. @jrocha I just reopened it for you. There should have been a button with \"reopen pull request\" down here as it was not merged yet, but just closed.\nI would also suggest that you keep the master of your fork unchanged and create branches from it for PRs (see e.g. https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches) . There a some further code areas which use:\nisdigit\ninstead of \n_istdigit\non generic_string, e.g.\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/WinControls/PluginsAdmin/pluginsAdmin.h#L54\nor TCHAR:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/ef13902206f80e00dcfd7d85b342066ed6f86d66/PowerEditor/src/WinControls/WindowsDlg/WindowsDlg.cpp#L89\nand maybe also the scintilla component need to be checked.. Please checkout/contribute to #1247. Thanks @ne0fyt Confirmed the bug is still there, see https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/stylers.model.xml#L966.. See also discussion:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16693/invalid-structure-of-stylers-model-xml/5. @SinghRajenM  Could take a look at this and the similar once:\n https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/1786\n https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/2440\n https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/2454\n https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/2817\nand some corresponding community threads\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16558/can-t-set-notepad-as-a-default-program-for-any-extension-windows-10\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16558/can-t-set-notepad-as-a-default-program-for-any-extension-windows-10\n. See PR #5000 . @ytterx Do you have the same as issue as described by @versat ?. @9527KGG Seems you have https://github.com/chcg/NPP_HexEdit/releases/tag/0.9.5.19 installed.\nWith 7.6.3 you are facing the changed install folder behaviour of N++. Beyond the plugin folder the plugin dll itself needs to be in a subfolder named like the plugin. So .../plugins/HexEditor/HexEditor.dll. There is a request to integrate Hexeditor into PA, see https://github.com/chcg/NPP_HexEdit/issues/9. @dyngari Which coding has the document you try to apply the UDL on? UTF-8 or something else?\nCould you provide the exported UDL and a test documnet here?. @alexhass From my understanding of the PR the issue is about scenario that the option for auto updater is unchecked during installation and the already available auto updater was not properly removed.. @acenturyandabit Closed this one in favour of #4769 as some more information is available already there. Copied the information from here.. @SinghRajenM Would be interesting if wingup repo really contains the latest version as https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/89fbbad94e50e168c00ffa2ef3273f9cb4f3e3ba/PowerEditor/bin/change.log references a 5.0.2 version.. Please check/contribute to #1247. @neji205 Which coding has the document you try to apply the UDL on? UTF-8 or something else?. From #4711 \n\n- This is a generic template and may not be applicable in all cases. \n- Try to follow it where possible. \nDescription of the Issue\n- Provide a more detailed description to the issue itself \nSyntax highlighting is not enabled when dragging tabs between different instances\nSteps to Reproduce the Issue\n- Set of steps to reproduce this issue \n1.

Seems similar to e.g. https://github.com/ashkulz/NppFTP/issues/164 or https://github.com/ashkulz/NppFTP/issues/141. @jr3074  You may want to test current release https://github.com/ashkulz/NppFTP/releases/tag/v0.28.0 which contains updated libssh version 0.8.6 with support for additional algorithms.. @guielebo @sthag N++ comes with a quite old version of Dspell out of the box. Could you check the behaviour with current release:\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/v1.4.6. Maybe you want to try https://github.com/ashkulz/NppFTP/releases first to find out if really something is missing for your usecase.. See https://github.com/cmeriaux/scintilla/tree/npp-3-7-0 for a patched version of scintilla for N++.. @donho Any plans to update the scintilla base to the current LTS version any time soon?. See e.g https://lemire.me/blog/2018/05/09/how-quickly-can-you-check-that-a-string-is-valid-unicode-utf-8/\nor\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Programming--how-to-detect-and-read-UTF-8-charact/. @CookiePLMonster @donho \n\nSee https://cgit.freedesktop.org/uchardet/uchardet/commit/?id=26e1cebad15749a3aced87ff22fb18bf55dacd79 for czech support\nthat is to be not yet part of latest release 0.0.6 and no newer release is available with it.. As sasummer mentioned above, see https://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaHistory.html version 3.7.0\n\n-EDGE_MULTILINE and SCI_MULTIEDGEADDLINE added to allow displaying multiple vertical edges simultaneously.\n\nthere is currently no plans from donho to update scintilla as far as I know.. . @donho Seems your request is done and this could be merged now.. Rebasing done.. @dail8859 Do you think the autocompletion list makes sense?. @prog20901 Why? You can install nppgtags with N++ 7.6 via new PluginAdmin easily.. @ranjan-ranjan See https://github.com/gup4win/wingup/pull/27. Is this the expected change?. As gup crashes the right place would be https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/wingup/issues.\n@Tharn Is this issue reproducible for you? Just happening with the compare plugin or with all install actions?\nCan't reproduce it until now.. @abdulbadii Settings -> Preferences... -> Editing ->Display line number\nGoogle Search https://www.google.com/search?q=Display+line+number+n%2B%2B&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 e.g.\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-show-and-hide-line-numbers-in-notepad-plus-plus/\nThat didn't change lately.\nCould this one be closed?\n. @bammab Seems you are talking about the builtin pluginAdmin and not the separate plugin pluginManager ( https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager ) as the pluginManager plugin doesn't appear in your debug info. Is this correct? . @SergeyLastochkin You should test it with https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/releases/tag/v7.6\nas there https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/bfb7e863cc6cd20f9f32389bee289607a212b12b is contained which might improve this behaviour.\nBut be aware of the breaking changes with the plugin system https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.6-released.html. @MurraySobol I think to right place is here https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/issues. As the plugin maintainer needs to support this.\nFrom my understanding you are not requesting to bundle the latest release 1.4.8 with N++ version as the title might make one think of first.\nCould you confirm that this issue here could be closed in favour of one to dspellcheck?. Seems to be ok according to https://translate.google.com/#iw/en/%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F%0A%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%94. Probably import issue fixed with https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/f03ce289d34a44671ba518273220e0785eeaed80, so with next release probably 7.6.1. . @biswadeep-sarkar See https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/issues/151 and https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/issues/139. So check your installed DSpellCheck plugin version and update to 1.4.8. . @CoR--  Could you provide debug information of your installation (see N++menu ?->Debug Info ...). Which version of dspellcheck plugin do you use?. @CoR-- \nSee https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases for updated version, which should contain a fix for the issue you observed.\nWith next update of the plugin list the new release will be available.. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16645/new-plugins-home-where-notepad-will-load-from, the discussion on this is already ongoing.\nAlso the lake of support from PA for the portable version is a known issue, see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16566/support-for-plugins-admin-npppluginlist/27\nYou have to distinguish between new https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.6-released.html and longer available plugin https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager\n. @wgw You may want to checkout https://github.com/HQJaTu/NPPTextFX, at least some current development seems to go on there.. Known issue with plugin admin related changes, see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.6-released.html. For the dicussion see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16645/new-plugins-home-where-notepad-will-load-from and https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16621/notepad-7-6-new-plugins-admin. @HeinrichGit Really WinXP SP2? Not even SP3.\nWhat means WinXP crashes? Bluescreen of winxp or n++ application crashes.\nN++ uses platform toolset v140_xp to build, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/jj851139.aspx, so just WinXP SP3 is supported at least since the change to build with visual studio 2015, but I think vs2013 with v120_xp before has the same limitation. You might want to checkout the change logs from N++ if there is some hint when exactly support for SP2 was dropped.. See https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/. This component is used to predict which type of file you have depending on the chars found in the text. See https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-3, so maybe some turkish/esperanto chars are part of your text. Could that be the case? \nWhat is your setting under \nsettings -> preferences ... -> New Document?\n\n. As this is a mime tool issue the right place is https://github.com/npp-plugins/mimetools/issues.\n@ro0ter Could you please move the issue to the plugin queue..

So it might be not a immediate must have fix. I now added also the regression label.. The info about the necessary manual movement of the plugins could be found here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.6-released.html. Unfortunately you need to create also subdirs for each of the plugins, so just moving the plugins dir is not sufficient.\nSeems this one could be closed as you already created issue 5077 and used a reinstallation as \"workaround\".. @mohannad-abwah \nI think a bug.

NppExport is not available for x64 from the original author.. @cjblakeney See https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches and there the section:\n\nFOR PLUGIN USERS:\nto remedy this problem, after the update, you can :\nFind the name of plugin you want to migrate in %PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\myAwesomePlugin.dll (or %PROGRAMFILES%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\myAwesomePlugin.dll, according the achetecture of your Notepad++).\ngo to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\ to create myAwesomePlugin folder.\nmove the plungin myAwesomePlugin.dll from %PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\ to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\myAwesomePlugin.\nThat\u2019s it. Restart Notepad++ and you get your beloved plugins back.\n\nso manual action is needed after update to 7.6. @rniccolls Plugin Manager plugin https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/releases. Or maybe you are searching for the builtin PluginAdmin, see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.6-released.html. Can't reproduced this issue. \n- Is this a new issue starting to happen with N++ 7.5.9?\n- Are just js files affected? Or is this also happening for e.g. html files.\nCould you check %AppData%\\Notepad++\\session.xml\nand for your file the lang=\"XY\" tag, e.g.\n<File firstVisibleLine=\"0\" xOffset=\"0\" scrollWidth=\"6572360\" startPos=\"66974\" endPos=\"0\" selMode=\"0\" lang=\"JSON\" encoding=\"-1\" .... />. @donho \nI think I did:\nb. copy 2 commands \"git checkout -b USER-BRANCH_NAME master\" and \"git pull https://github.com/USER/nppPluginList.git USER-BRANCH_NAME\" to execute on your local git repository with git command.\nc. copy 2 commands \"git checkout master\" and \"git merge --no-ff USER-BRANCH_NAME\" from the github PR page then execute on your local git repository with git command.\n-  skipped as I thought that is not needed as there were no conflicts:\nd. execute \"git rebase -i\" on your local git repository with git command to fix up if needs.\ne. execute \"git commit --amend\" on my local git repository with git command to make a more pertinent commit comment if needs.\n- and then:\nf. \"git push\"\n, but it seems the history look different from your merges. \nIs point d. needed therefore?\nI did point b. on a checkout of the n++ master.\nIs point b. needed if I just want to do the merge?. I think it should be possible to do a similar check as for the json format via python at https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/nppPluginList/blob/master/validator.py also for the xmls under ...\\notepad-plus-plus\\PowerEditor\\installer\\APIs and ...\\notepad-plus-plus\\PowerEditor\\installer\\nativeLang. Maybe even add an xml schema to even better check the content of the xmls.\nI will take a look at that.. @SinghRajenM Hm, but which PR is releated to 4595? It is not referenced there.\nAnyhow just donho is doing the work here and my feeling is that the inflow is a little bit to much for just one guy not working fulltime on it. Or maybe even too much for just one in fulltime.\nAnd I guess a bug only mode with feature requests/enhancements/etc. are not rejected immediately to reduce the current amount of issues might be ok for a profit project but as this is just spare time the focus is probably more driven by current interests as user needs/problems. \nAs my part is just https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/nppPluginList I try to sort and classify things here.\nI think some maintainer for various areas of N++ would be helpful as e.g. normal translation PR merges might be also done by someone else apart from donho with some multi-language background.. @Kyudos \nWith which version of N++ do you observe this?\nIs N++ the only program showing this problem?. @Raintek Last update means 7.6?\nThere was a change to update uchardet to 0.0.6 https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/bfb7e863cc6cd20f9f32389bee289607a212b12b.\nThe automatic char encoding detection could be switched off at settings -> preferences:\n\n. So to fix this problem the uchardet component from https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/ would need to corrected/change it. \nYou might create an issue at their bugtracker.. @donho See:\n\nThe patch is against an old 3.x version of Scintilla so will not apply. For example, Platform::DBCSCharLength no longer exists. The patch does not add GB18030 cases to 4.x methods like IsDBCSLeadByteInvalid and IsDBCSTrailByteInvalid.\nThe patch does not appear to handle all GB18030 cases. GB18030 includes 4-byte characters and Scintilla's DBCS support includes code where only 1 or 2-byte characters will work, such as in SafeSegment:\n\nSo it seems to be unlikely that this change will ever appear on a 3.x branch. If this would be added to scintilla how to you plan to backport this for N++?. @Aidolii Yes, but it is fixed now by https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.2.html. @schnurlos \nMacro -> \"Trim Trailing Space and Save\"\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/ef13902206f80e00dcfd7d85b342066ed6f86d66/PowerEditor/src/shortcuts.xml#L4\nRun ->  \"Launch in Firefox\" to \"Send via Outlook\", see\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/ef13902206f80e00dcfd7d85b342066ed6f86d66/PowerEditor/src/shortcuts.xml#L10-L17\n-> seems this both item can't be translated, if not language specific default shortcut.xml files would be added\n. @hinst Seems you used PluginManager for installation. See https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/issues/139 , so this is the wrong place to report this issue.\nMaybe you want to use the builtin PluginAdmin for installation.. @hinst Can't reproduce the problem of installing JSTool with the builtin PluginAdmin for N++ 64bit on Win10 64bit. What happens for other plugins or updating e.g. DSpell plugin?. @DavidHansen-0x454d43 \n@Ola-Ponny \nDid you check current docu on UDL at https://ivan-radic.github.io/udl-documentation ?\nRegarding lexer/folding, see https://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html as these are baic functions of scintilla itself.\nIf you want to modify the php language itself langs.xml seems to be the file which needs to be modified. Maybe in combination with stylers.xml. Depending on your installation the place on disc is different. \nThe template therefore are https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/langs.model.xml and https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/stylers.model.xml.\nAnyhow https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/ is a good place to checkout previous such conversations or start a new thread. \n. Additionally an entry in:\nPowerEditor/src/localizationString.h\nis needed and for installation/uninstallation:\nPowerEditor/installer/nsisInclude/langs4Npp.nsh\nneeds to be extended.. @qz3fwd @jkunkee See e.g. https://github.com/npp-plugins/plugintemplate as starting point for plugin development used by various plugins. There are also plugins not written in C++, but C#, Delphi, etc.\nSee also https://github.com/chcg/nppPluginList/tree/appveyor_for_arm. See also #431. So the better place for this would be https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=uchardet as uchardet 0.0.6 was included  with https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/bfb7e863cc6cd20f9f32389bee289607a212b12b. @MetaChuh I didn't test it, but thought as the checkin https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/bfb7e863cc6cd20f9f32389bee289607a212b12b contains the released version from https://www.freedesktop.org/software/uchardet/releases/uchardet-0.0.6.tar.xz (with some differences for compiler warnings and line endings) that the behaviour would be identical.\nIf this is not the case :-( and has to be investigated.\nSeems you used some precompiled version from ubuntu, is this correct?\nDid you also compile the commandline version for windows and checked the examples there? . See https://fileinfo.com/extension/r, seems r is most commonly used for R in the first place.. @andrecool-68 \"Copy Text with Syntax Highlighting\" depends on availability of plugin NppExport.dll.\nmimeTools.dll provides the Base64 Encode\\Base64 Decode functionality. So these plugins need to be available to have the context menu entries.. @andrecool-68 Checked the reported plugins from your debug infos posted above:\n64bit\nPlugins : DSpellCheck.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll\nvs.\n32bit\nPlugins : DSpellCheck.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll\nThe NppExport.dll is just available for 32bit from the installation files, but not for 64bit.\nYou might want to take a look here: https://github.com/chcg/NPP_ExportPlugin/releases\n, if you need a 64bit version of NppExport.dll\n. @CompactFactor Couldn't reproduce the issue on win10 64bit.\nDid you try to install or update other plugins from the list and facing the same problem? E.g. update DSpellCheck. . @CompactFactor See https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/wingup/tree/master/src/ConfigFiles, proxy should be possible by adding it via ?->Set Updater Proxy.... @EbATpy I can confirm that arxml files are opened automatically as xml files by N++ 7.6.2, if the xml tag \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\nis included at the start, but that is not done based on the filename. Otherwise a change at:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/langs.model.xml#L380\nwould be needed or the user specific change proposed above by @sasumner . @viveksejpal See\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/scintilla/boostregex/nppSpecifics.mak#L10\nDo you have (..\\boostregex\\boostpath.mak)?\n. @viveksejpal As long as this file is available NOBOOST will not be used. So you have to rename or delete it.\nFurthermore it is possible to use C++11 regex, but that is not implemented yet. See\nhttps://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaHistory.html Release 3.5.2\n-  Include support for using C++11  for regular expression searches. Enabling this requires rebuilding Scintilla with a non-default option. This is a provisional feature and may change API before being made permanent.\nN++ used modified scintilla 3.5.6 right now.\nAdditionally see https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/139, but don't remember how the build for CXX11_REGEX worked or not.. @viveksejpal Guess this is an issue with the location of the SciLexer.dll which is not in the same dir as N++.exe, see\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/fdf954f714325b41a86b745f3e3525277ba17ca4/PowerEditor/src/ScitillaComponent/ScintillaEditView.cpp#L226-L229\nIf n++.exe is build as release version you would need a signed SciLexer.dll . Either you use n++.exe from a debug build or you have to modify the sourcecode at:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/fdf954f714325b41a86b745f3e3525277ba17ca4/PowerEditor/src/ScitillaComponent/ScintillaEditView.cpp#L205-L221. @donho The request from https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16567/plugins-loading-way-has-been-changed-in-notepad-7-6-and-upper-versions/10. See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16645/new-plugins-home-where-notepad-will-load-from and PR #5199 \nand\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16790/notepad-7-6-1\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16848/notepad-v7-6-2-yellow-vest-gilet-jaune-edition/19. See also https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/nppPluginList/issues/46. @fufu65 Is this happening with just the standard plugins of the installer or are other plugins installed? Do you have a rough number of pdf/zip to open to observe this behaviour? . Should be:\n\n, but this is just the case on switching language to english and back to japanese. This also happens for all the other languages e.g. german. This is not an issue in the translation file, see\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/installer/nativeLang/japanese.xml#L360\n, but in the init/drawing of the dialog tab if the first call after N++ start is FindInFiles. It is working fine if the first call goes to the other dialog tabs Find or Replace or Mark for the rest of the session, but if it is broken it stays that way.\nSee https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/0f936707a2457eb4611d7d42a68a3e066614f8e4/PowerEditor/src/NppCommands.cpp#L963-L992\nthere seems to be a difference in handling the call to IDM_SEARCH_FIND , IDM_SEARCH_REPLACE , IDM_SEARCH_MARK which call changeFindReplaceDlgLang() compared to IDM_SEARCH_FINDINFILES redirecting to NPPM_LAUNCHFINDINFILESDLG with:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/e9563aeb8c6a0b70354a9c191f111a9394da754b/PowerEditor/src/NppBigSwitch.cpp#L252-L269\nSo probably \nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/e9563aeb8c6a0b70354a9c191f111a9394da754b/PowerEditor/src/NppBigSwitch.cpp#L264\nis the problem.\n. See #715 with corresponding PR. @coooool123 \nWhich N++ version?\nWhat encoding do you use within N++? UTF-8?\nCould you add an example of the broken emoji's here.\nWhat font do you use for notepad compared to notepad++?. @01mrunalshinde See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.6.1-released.html about new plugin folder.. You will also find this behaviour with:\n\n, but is this a real world use case of a text editor with \"normal\" space separated languages?. @KOLANICH @MAPJe71 The main blocking point against just using the std c++11 regex (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/syntax_option_type) was the missing feature of perl  regex style available from boost (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/ref/syntax_option_type/syntax_option_type_synopsis.html) used by N++.\nSee https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/139\nand\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/features/\n\nPCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expression) Search/Replace\n\nBut if you try to build scintilla with NO_BOOST it is probably better to use SCFIND_CXX11REGEX instead of the older builtin system:\n\nYou can build SciLexer.dll without Boost, ie. with its default POSIX regular expression support instead of boost's PCRE one. This is useful if you would like to debug Notepad++, but don't have boost.\n. @rra0137 Where is the picture taken from? \nWhat I just tested with N++ 7.6.2 is the issue that zulu.xml and kurdish.xml have the format UTF-8 BOM and therefore are broken.. @rra0137 You are working directly on the master branch of your fork from N++ git repository. It would be better to use branches for your work and leave the master unchanged.\n\nSee e.g. https://gist.github.com/vlandham/3b2b79c40bc7353ae95a. @donho Zulu is missing here https://notepad-plus-plus.org/contribute/binary-translations.html, so probably the flag of south africa, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_people.. See https://github.com/morbac/xmltools/issues/13. This is the wrong ticket queue.\nInteresting is probably N++ version. Which kind of installation, installer/portable. 32\\64bit.\nAvailable from N++ debug info.. @beerisgood See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.3.html, seems this could be closed similar to #2327.. @SinghRajenM Is this addressed by PR #5000 or #4772?. Without the workaround the file is detected as ISO 8859-2.. @IvanUrwin Did you update N++? To which version? 7.5.9 like seen above or a newer one after 7.6.x?\nOr did you update one of the plugins?. @changtj See https://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/Hex%20Editor/ and the ticket tab there. But as the hexeditor seems to be not actively maintained you may want to edit a issue at https://github.com/chcg/NPP_HexEdit. @Kataderon @donho Guess switch on/off sorting is meant.. @grizlupo See https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/ with code at https://cgit.freedesktop.org/uchardet/uchardet/.  Seems https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/uchardet/uchardet/issues could be used also to create a new issue with a request to support johab + https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/uchardet/uchardet/merge_requests to create a PR. Seems there was no request like this one before by searching project bugzilla https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=uchardet. @timikesmarky The plugin \"Visual Studio Line Copy\" is available with N++ 7.6.4 from the PluginAdmin list. It is working for me. It copies indeed also the line-ending as sasummer expected.. Sorry I was to late for merging it on my own.. Think this part is a leftover of the old days with ANSI and Unicode version (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v5.9.6.2.html) , but \n_callWindowProc = CallWindowProcW;\nshould be\n_callWindowProc = CallWindowProc;\n.

What about a nullpointer check for pEnd before dereferencing it?  At least if str2cut is a nullpointer this causes trouble.. Seems this version is not reading over input separating the text with multiple spaces, which seems to be the case in the original version.. Amend and force push is working for PRs. Thanks for the countercheck. I will close my PR in favor of this one..

Might reintroduce an issue.. @SinghRajenM Unfortunately the commit doesn't specify more clearly what the observed bug was, but it introduced the additional variable index2. Maybe it is safer to keep it splitted into two independent variables and be sure to avoid crosstalking between activeIndex and activeView.. Is there are reason not to use utf-8 as encoding?. Should language be added?. Other files have e.g.:\n<AutoComplete language=\"C\">\n. Maybe added because of https://scintilla-interest.narkive.com/TWBDw58B/problem-with-sci-bracematch.

The issues that you referenced (i.e. Github #19 and SF #5266 both indicate that this is a problem with opening multiple files which is not where I'm encountering the problem (it happens when I double-click a single file).  This may well be the same issue but I wasn't sure if you had just done a quick cursory reading of my problem description and missed the difference.\nI also was trying to grok the steps (rebuild everything or just patch current install?) and file(s) needed to fix it (if this is the same issue).  Github #15 is a source file which leads me to believe that s full rebuild is necessary whereas SF #5266 references patch 656 (which seems to introduce a bug that #15 is meant to fix?); I didn't see a patch newer than 656 that seemed to address the bug so it looks like a patch isn't on the menu.\nAnyway, if you can confirm that this issue is one and the same I will be happy to close this out.\nThanks for your work on the project!\nGary\n.

I'm talking about a GitHub organisation. Something like github.com/notepad-plus-plus which would include all Notepad++ related repos (which may existing in the future) then. ;)\n. @donho Great! :)\nAfter you have created the organisation now, you can simple transfer this repository to the organisation. All URLs pointing to the old location will be redirected to the new one.\n. :+1: for CMake\n. When I got it right then this was never a Notepad++ issue. I guess it can be closed :)\n. @chcg Well, my comment was addressed to @donho. I did directly comment his commit, but GitHub is displaying all comments on all commits ;)\n. Unicode should be the way to go :)\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. I had this trouble a while ago also, while searching I noticed that A LOT of people are missing such a feature. Would be a nice thing :)\n. Why is this a bad thing?\n. Not sure if this is helpful, but I just found https://github.com/notepadqq/notepadqq\n. Why is this closed and added to a milestone when it's obviously not done?\n. Related to this: I would whish that you can easily change the path where all settings are getting saved. Notepad++ can never support all cloud/synchro apps, but if I could change the path to the directory which gets synchronized it should work fine with the most things.\n. Why are there PRs which don't get any official reaction in 8 months?\n. :+1: \n. See #332.\n. Semantic versioning would be really reasonable. I never understood the current version scheme.\n. Nobody has yet, at least the search doesn't give any matches :)\nRust support would be indeed great.\n. Maybe we can reuse @pfalabella's work: https://github.com/pfalabella/Rust-notepadplusplus (I'm not sure how complete this is).\n. Could get closed because of #1258\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. See #332.\n. Hint: Better use the label \"wontfix\" instead of \"invalid\".\nIt's not an invalid request, but was denied :) \n. Be more patient ;)\n. If you can you should provide more information. Did any error message shown up? Any warnings? Anything else? How did you start it?\n. If you upgrade to the latest Notepad++ version you don't have options for specific cloud solutions anymore, but you can set a path to a (cloud-)folder (which can be ofc also OneDrive). \nThanks to this change Notepad++ is now supporting basically any cloud solution and doesn't need to keep track of all of this API changes, which could break compatibility.\n. This might be redundant in the long run because of #332.\n@milipili:\n\nFrom now on, cross-platform is required in any new code.\n. @ariccio Yeah :laughing: \n. You should provide more information. Do you use the latest Notepad++ Version, on what OS are you? \nIt's working fine for me. Perhaps you running Notepad++ as an Admin? \n. It's written in the title \"[Running as Administrator]\" or something similar. After updating, Notepad++ is running as an admin. This issue was discussed somewhere else by @donho and some other people, but I don't remember the issue(?).\n. That's interesting, sometimes it's working for me, sometimes not.\nIn some cases I don't see icons at all, in some cases the height of the toolbar isn't getting smaller when I'm switching from the big icons to the small icons. Just try to wildly change this option in different orders. I can't see a real pattern there. I'm on Windows 7.\n\nA bit off-topic: I suppose the big majority will agree that the old icons are ugly. Why keep them? Same with stuff like the old application icon, which you can select in the installer. What's the purpose of that?\n. Speaking of me, I won't drop my friendly request for a new UI just because of new icons. Some fonts are too small in menus to be eye friendly, the navigation texts in the option dialog is for e.g. cut off, because of a too narrow navigation and on a lot spots the colours don't match the set theme.\nAlso it's hard to navigate in the menus because of so many options (which is great, but then you need a good UI as well) and too less icons or seperations on which you can orient yourself.\n. Related: #686\n. Isn't that exactly the opposite of everything from now on must be cross platform? :) \n. I'm wondering why GitHub isn't showing any change for the first commit...?\n. Please use https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/ for all kind of how-to-do-it questions to keep the GitHub issues clean :)\n. @h-h-h-h @dail8859 Alright, wasn't aware for that :)\n. :+1: \n. Btw, next time just write #817 in the title instead of the whole URL. In the comments it gets shortened automatically by GitHub, but that's not working in titles.\n. Please implement that, it's annoying me almost daily.\n. Readmes and documentation is always good :+1: \n. :+1: \n. That's a duplicate of #622 und should be closed. Please use the search next time.\n. You should try to avoid merge commits by using rebase ;)\n. What would be the benefit from it? You can just mark words and the number of chars are getting displayed in the bar at the bottom.\n. :+1: \n. I'm fully supporting this, since the current behaviour annoys me on a regular basis. Yes, I want to reload the background files but I don't want to switch to it.\n. To quote Wikipedia:\n\nAlthough the first letter of a camel case compound word may or may not be capitalized, the term camel case generally implies lowercase first letter.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase\n\nAnd that's my understanding of camelCase as well.\n. @ddfssdfkofdsfighdfuigf Please close this issue.\n. :+1: \n. Afaik that is a duplicate of #1266. Please use the search first.\n. FYI there is an organisation called Notepad++ plugins: https://github.com/npp-plugins\n. Duplicate of #732.\nUse the search.\n. Please use the search.\nDuplicate of #108 and #332. Related to #662\n. :+1: \n. Why did you open three PRs: #1385, #1386?\n. At least close the others if they were a mistake.\n. Honestely, I think https://waffle.io would have been a better choice since it doesn't require to install anything.\n. Duplicate of #1087. Please use the search first.\n.

    "guy038": "Hello Zantier, tommilligan, jonandr and All,\nI did some tests, on a 6.7.9 version, with its native plugins, and I found out a strange rule about that regex issue ! Follow the few steps below, to reproduce it :\n- Let's suppose that you write, in a new tab, a line with several lower letters a ( let's say, for instance, between 10 and 20 )\n- Then, just add some lines, even empty, before and after this line of a's letters, with the two following conditions :\n1) They don't contain any lower letter  a or b\n2) If your select all the contents of that test file, you get, exactly, 285 characters \n- Go back to the very beginning of the file ( CTRL + Origin )\n- Open the Find dialog\n- Check  the Match case option and the Regular expression radio button\n- Uncheck the option Wrap around\n- Type the Zantier's regex ([^b])*b in the Find what zone\n=> When clicking on the Find Next button, you wrongly get the entire contents of this test file :-(\nNow, :\n- Close the Find dialog , hitting the ESC key\n- Delete ONE character ONLY, in a line, located before, or even after, the line of a's ( so, if you hit CTRL-A, you get, exactly, a 284 characters selection )\n- Go back, again, to the very beginning of the file, with the CTRL + Origin shortcut\n- Type on the F3 key to repeat the same regex search ([^b])*b\n=> This time, the regex engine, doesn't find, as expected, any matched string ( as the file contains NO lower letter b )\nSo, for some odd reasons, this regex doesn't work, as soon as the size of the file is > 284 bytes ???\nThen, I replace, successively, the SciLexer.dll v3.5.6 file by :\n- The last version of SciLexer.dll v3.3.4 ( which came with N++ 6.7.3 ) => Same limit, between 284 and 285\n- The last version of SciLexer.dll v2.2.7 ( which came with N++ 6.3.0 ) => The limit is between 269 and 270\n\nBTW, the regex ([^b])+b produces the same issue, but, luckily, the regexes ([^b]*)b ( that, however, creates a different group 1 ) and the regex [^b]*b, do work, in all cases, independently of the file\"'s size !\nBest regards,\nguy038\n. Hi StanDog,\nYou're perfectly right. The Don's reply to my SF post was created 50mn before my same post on GitHub, but I didn't look for SF forums till today.\nIt's just that I wanted to try posting something on this new site ( for me ! ) and to get used to the GitHub's interface.\nBy the way, the Github Markdown syntax is very similar to the one used in SF. But I've never been able to get underlined text :-(( ( It should be something like <u>......</u> but that doesn't work ! )\nAnyway, it's nice that Don can, still, keep a read-only link to our old posts on SF !\nBest regards,\nguy038\n. Hi, Noitidart,\nIndeed, the N++ Blank Operations, logically, work on the totality of the current file !\nHowever, if you like to delete leading and/or trailing horizontal blanks characters, as spaces ( \\x20 ), tabulations ( \\x09 ) and the No Break space character ( \\xa0 ), on selection ONLY, use the \\h escape sequence and follow these few steps below :\n- FIRST, create a selection of the lines, where you want to apply the trim operation\n- Open the Replace dialog ( CTRL + H )\n- Enter the SEARCH regex \\h+$ for trailing blanks, ^\\h+ for leading blanks and ^\\h+|\\h+$ for both\n- Leave the REPLACE field empty\n- Check the In selection option\n- Click on the Replace All button\nEt voil\u00e0 !\nBest regards,\nguy038\nP.S. : You need an N++ release,  >= v6.0, which uses the new Boost C++ Regex library, very similar to PCRE !\n.

Hello tico-tico,\nI suppose that you would like to create a macro, in order to be able to affect a user shortcut, for this operation,  wouldn't you ?\nIndeed, the two entries Remove Empty Lines and Remove Empty Lines (Containing Blanck characters) can't be found in the Shortcut Mapper :-((\nLuckily, you still can create a macro, which does a search/replacement with regexes, to delete these specific lines\n\nTo do so :\n- In a new tab, type some text, with few blank lines\n- Select the menu option Macro - Start recording OR the red circle button, on the Toolbar\n- Open the Replace dialog ( CTRL + H )\n- In the Find what zone, type ^\\R ( for exact empty lines ) or ^\\h*\\R ( for empty lines with blanks, only ) \n- Leave the Replace with zone EMPTY\n- Check the Wrap around option\n- Select the Regular expression search mode\n- Click on the Replace All button\n- Select the menu option Macro - Stop Recording OR the black square button, on the Toolbar\n- Open the menu option Macro - Save Currend recorded Macro...\n- Type, for instance, Suppress BLANK and EMPTY lines, as the current name for this macro\n- Choose a shortcut for this macro ( Take care NOT to use an existing Notepad++ or plugin shortcut ! )\n- Click on the OK button, to valid your choices\nBest regards,\nguy038\nReminder :\nThe \\R syntax matches any Unicode New Line sequence and is equivalent to the regex, below :\n(?>\\r\\n|\\n|\\x0b|\\f|\\r|\\x85)\n. Hello odie2 and vzjrz,\nNo, guys, you're, both, wrong ! With Notepad++, it's quite possible to search backwards, in Ragular expression mode\nA quick example :\n- In a new tab, write the few lines, below\n```\n    Test\n    123\n    Example\nTest\n456\nExample\n\nTest\n789\nExample\n\n``\n- Go back to the **beginning** of the text ( **CTRL + Origin** )\n- Open the **Find** dialog ( **CTRL + F** )\n- Check the **Wrap around** option\n- Select the **Regular expression** search mode\n- Type the regex **Test\\R\\d+\\RExample` in the search field\n- Click on the Find Next to reach the first match and _to memorize the search regex_\n- Then, hit the ESC key to close the Find dialog ( IMPORTANT )\n- Now, use the SHIFT + F3 shortcut, to select the previous match => you get the third and last block !\n- If you use again the SHIFT + F3 shortcut, you select the second** block, and so on...\nOf course, any hit on the F3 key, ONLY, will restart the search, in the down direction\nRemark :\nLet's imagine the subject string below :\naaabbababaaabbbbababbbab\nand the simple regex a+b+\nThen :\n- Locate the cursor before that string\n- Do a first search to select the string aaabb\n- Again, hit the ESC key to close the Search dialog\n- After 6 other hits, on the F3 key, you, finally, match the string ab\n- Now, just go backwards, hitting the SHIFT + F3 shortcut, repeatedly\nDo you see the differences ? And with complicated regexes, it can be worse, with unpredictable results :-(\nThat's why it's commonly accepted that regex's search is processed, in downwards direction, to always get right matches !\nBest Regards,\nguy038\nBTW, the \\R syntax stands for any kind of EOL characters ( \\r\\n, in Windows files, \\n, in OSD/Unix files or \\r for Old Mac files )\n. Hello Vlad417,\nYeh, you're perfectly right !

Hello, tvman-123,\nAs a work-around, you could use the syntax %2300F ! It should be OK :-)) ( indeed, the Unicode code of the # character is \\x{0023} )\nBest Regards,\nguy038\n.

Hi Yaron,\nAh! Yes, you would like that, as soon as we hold down the left-mouse button, after dragging along, the caret comes inside view, automatically, wouldn't you ?\nIn the meanwhile, Yaron, we, just, can :\n- Click anywhere, on the current screen reached ( Obvious ! )\n- Use the Scintilla command SCI_MOVECARETINSIDEVIEW\nTo use it, simply set a shortcut to that command, in Settings > Shortcut Mapper... > Scintilla commands > 20\n\nThere are four Scintilla commands, relative to the caret, recapitulated in the table below :\n\u2022============================================================\u2022\n   |    Scintilla Command      |  Id  |       MY shortcuts      |\n   \u2022===========================\u2022======\u2022=========================\u2022\n   |  SCI_SCROLLCARET          |  18  |   Ctrl  +            =  |\n   |  SCI_MOVECARETINSIDEVIEW  |  20  |   Ctrl  +  Shift  +  =  |\n   |  SCI_SWAPMAINANCHORCARET  |  96  |   Alt   +            =  |\n   |  SCI_ROTATESELECTION      |  97  |   Alt   +  Shift  +  =  |\n   \u2022============================================================\u2022\n- The SCI_SCROLLCARET move the editor windows to the present location of the caret\n- The SCI_MOVECARETINSIDEVIEW move the caret to the present editor window\n- The SCI_SWAPMAINANCHORCARET swap the caret between the start and the end of the present normal selection\n- The SCI_ROTATESELECTION move to the next normal created selection ( even outside view ! ) when multiple selections exists AND if the option Multi-Editing, in Settings > Preferences... > Editing, is enabled, of course !\nBest Regards,\nguy038\n. Hello, thedarkfalcon,\nWell, let's begin with the SCI_MOVECARETINSIDEVIEW Scintilla command, which moves the caret to the present editor window :\n- I suppose that you already affected a shortcut to that command\n- Open, for instance, the N++ license.txt file\n- Replace, if necessary, the caret at the very beginning of that file\n- Now, hold down the left mouse on the vertical lift, on the right, in order to scroll down the contents, till you do not see the caret anymore\n- Hit your assigned shortcut, for the SCI_MOVECARETINSIDEVIEW Scintilla\n=> The caret should appear, as expected, at the beginning if the first visible line of the present editor window :-))\nRemark :\n- If the caret is near the end of the file and that you scroll up, with the mouse, till the beginning of the document, the action of the shortcut would move, this time, the caret to the last visible line of the present editor window !\nBest Regards,\nguy038\n. Hi, Yaron,\nOn my XP SP3 configuration :\n- The caret is, automatically, moved to the position where I right-clicked, for context menu\n- If I use the paste command of the context-menu, the text of the clipboard is, then, added at the caret location and, at the end, the caret's position is just after the pasted text !\nMay be, your behaviour is tied to the Hebrew RTL way of writing ?\nCheers,\nguy038\n. Hello, winnetou1357,\nNo, you're wrong about it !! Indeed, with the Boost 1.55 C++ regex library, used in Notepad++, you can, perfectly, use, references for groups, with number greater than 9 :-))\n\nAs a summary, references to a capturing group, of number N, in the searched regex, can be referenced, in replacement, by the following syntaxes :\n- The usual form \\N ( with the double condition 1 <= N <= 9 )\n- The form $N ( with the unique condition N > 0 )\n- The form ${N} ( with the unique condition N > 0 )\nIn addition, the overall searched regex can be referenced by the syntaxes $0 or the syntax ${0}\nRemarks :\n- Note that the syntax ${N} must be used if the other syntax $N would be followed by a digit, in order to distinguish between the true number of the group and the total range of digits ! For instance, in replacement the regex ${12}345 would replace the matched expression found by the contents of group 12, followed by the number 345  :-))\n- Any referenced group with a number, which does not exist, in the search regex, will be replaced by a zero length string\n\nSome simple examples :\n- Let's suppose the search regex (((((((((group 9))))))))) (group10) (group11) (group12), with a space character between a closing parenthesis and the next opening one\n- And that the subject text, to apply the S/R to, would be  : group 9 group10 group11 group12\nThen, if the replacement regex is :\n- <$0> , you would get the text : \n- 12345${0}67890 , you would get the text : 12345group 9 group10 group11 group1267890\n- [$9] and [$10] and [$11] and [$12] , you would get the text : [group 9] and [group10] and [group11] and [group12]\n- ${10}0------0\\90------0$12 , you would get the text : group100------0group 90------0group12 \n- \\1 $2 \\3 $4 \\5 $6 \\7 $8 \\9 $10 $11 $12` , you would get the text : group 9 group 9 group 9 group 9 group 9 group 9 group 9 group 9 group 9 group10 group11 group12\nFor that matter, click to the link, below :\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/format/boost_format_syntax.html#boost_regex.format.boost_format_syntax.placeholder_sequences\nBest regards,\nguy038\nP.S. :\nYou'll find good documentation, about the new Boost C++ Regex library, v1.55.0 ( similar to the PERL Regular Common Expressions, v1.48.0 ), used by Notepad++, since its 6.0 version, at the TWO addresses below :\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/perl_syntax.html\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/format/boost_format_syntax.html\n- The FIRST link explains the syntax, of regular expressions, in the SEARCH part\n- The SECOND link explains the syntax, of regular expressions, in the REPLACEMENT part\nYou may, also, look for valuable informations, on the sites, below :\nhttp://www.regular-expressions.info\nhttp://www.rexegg.com\n.

    "robert-andrzejuk": "Has anyone reported this on the Scintilla bug system?. ",
    "sasumner": "\nIt's an issue concerning Scintilla\n\nThe symptoms sound like Notepad++ isn't catching an exception that it should (see https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/4761#issuecomment-413838281).\nAnyway, if it is really thought to be a Scintilla issue, why not update Scintilla and see if it remains.  :-). > You see how dangerous this can be if you work on a live files without any backup?\nNo, it is not \"dangerous\" because Replace in Files has a confirmation popup.. @cganchev said:\n\nThe fix is quite easy...\n\nSo you should prepare a PR.... @cganchev said:\n\nbut I haven't tested it.\n\nNobody wants an untested PR.  :-(. @Codextor I believe that a long time ago, C did not accept // comments.  Thus there was no option, you had to use the other notation everywhere, single line or not.  I don't think you're going to find any kind of reference like you are looking for.. @Codextor I can't imagine so...  1999-ish was a long time ago.. @FredGandt said:\n\nI am frequently frustrated by the lack of this functionality...If I were more familiar with the code, I'd happily do the work...amazed that this open request from more than 3 years ago hasn't got...attention\n\nThink about how this frustration level would go up if you \"did the work\" and then that work got the same amount of attention as this open issue.\n. @FredGandt \nYou totally missed my point.  You assume your work would be integrated.  My point was it could sit here ignored and unintegrated, potentially forever...just like this issue that you pointed out has been here 3 years.. @rafaelcastrocouto \n\nHow can I help with this? This seems pretty straight forward to implement.\n\nYou make a PR for it.\nI (Python-)scripted this behavior a long time ago since it seems \"reluctant\" (well, request was from 2015) to go native:\ndesired_col = notepad.prompt('What column?', '', '')\ntry:\n    desired_col = int(desired_col) - 1\nexcept ValueError:\n    pass\nelse:\n    if desired_col >= 0:\n        cur_line_start_pos = editor.positionFromLine(editor.lineFromPosition(editor.getCurrentPos()))\n        len_cur_line_content = len(editor.getCurLine().rstrip('\\n\\r'))\n        new_pos = cur_line_start_pos + desired_col\n        if new_pos > cur_line_start_pos + len_cur_line_content:\n            new_pos = cur_line_start_pos + len_cur_line_content\n        editor.setCurrentPos(new_pos)\n        editor.chooseCaretX()\n        editor.setSelection(new_pos, new_pos)\n\n. @SalviaSage You don't put it in the startup file. You run it from the Pythonscript menu, or toolbar button (if assigned) or keycombo (if assigned). When you are needing to go to a specific column, THAT's when you run it.\n. See:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14146/why-doesn-t-a-tab-close-return-you-to-tab-most-recently-worked-in\nand:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14678/why-doesn-t-a-tab-close-return-you-to-tab-most-recently-worked-in-part-2. Possibly relevant:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14889/footer-sel-to-include-word-count. Maybe I'm off base here but perhaps an idea on why this hasn't been implemented is that it could be \"expensive\" to calculate the number of words in a really large document.  The standard things currently shown on the status bar are all direct Scintilla calls to data items that are already maintained.. @a4jp-com It is not advisable to compare Word or Open Office to Notepad++; apples and oranges.  As a raw assignment (won't use the word \"task\" here), it's not \"taxing on a modern day PC\"--however it would have to be \"architected\" in.  THAT part may or may not be \"easy\".  It is certainly easy to say \"just (count) the words\".. @a4jp-com said \"Where is the code for the summary word count and the toolbar currently?\"\nIf you are a programmer it might occur to you to search the project for a string such as:\nCharacters (without\nwhich should lead you very near the area you are asking about.  Not sure, though, didn't try it.... So maybe the discussion of this issue is getting a little too bogged down in my early comment about it being slow.  It is all a matter of scale.  If you edit mainly small files, having something constantly counting all the words and presenting that on the status bar is no big deal.  However, some people use Notepad++ to edit huge files (the largest it can handle), and in those cases having something constantly doing an action like this could be prohibitive.  So these users would start crying \"Why did N++ get so slow?!\".  I'm just saying this is a potential concern, not that it surely would happen.  It all gets back to architecture and design concerns, rather than just saying \"this surely must be easy to implement!\".  It is much better to be an on-demand feature that you summon up when needed, rather than always happening.  So we already have it in View->Summary; it just needs to be implemented for a selection when a selection is active when invoked.. Personally, I think that double-click is better.  Single-click is too prone to an accidental mouse click activating it.. I've never considered the difference in the amount of effort between a single click and a double click.  Thinking about it now, I think it is negligible.  Still vote for leaving this alone.. @NPPPFreak \nConcerning the \"carriage return\" issue...where do you think the column-mode caret should end up after executing your scenario?\n. Use the LuaScript plugin and the sample script that colors alternating lines differently:  https://dail8859.github.io/LuaScript/examples/stylecsv.lua.html. @bbatt, Curious...how is C:\\Users\\ a file...?. @standoski Not a dev, and I don't know the sort algo for this, but mod time CAN be an effective order because it shows you MRU.. @mal0ki How about the Markdown plugin for the time being?. I think the suggestion here is that the next/previous shortcuts, if added, are to work while the document being edited has focus, because when the Incremental find window has focus Enter is equivalent to pressing the > button and Shift+Enter is the same as pressing the < button.. >who would do it?\nAnyone that wants to can tackle it and submit it for inclusion in Notepad++.  Whether or not it will be picked up and integrated is another matter.  Some submissions get adopted, others don't.. Correct.  On the upside, if the Notepad++ developer picks it up and works on it, it is almost 100% to make it into a future release. :). >So what happens now?\nNothing.  Unless you want @zufuliu to provide you a binary with this change in it; suppose you'd have to ask for that...\n\nDo i just wait for the developer(s) to see if they pick it up and implement it in a future release? \n\nYes; didn't I already explain this earlier?\n\nWould they notify us...?\n\nNot directly, but they would interact with this issue thread to integrate it and thus you would get automatic emails about the activity, just like you do when someone comments (presumes you have your preferences for this site set such that you want emails).\n\nAnd how long would it take to be implemented if it is implemented?\n\nIt could be as early as today or as long as infinity.. Note that I don't know if @zufuliu is even offering that up...but the binary would be an .exe file with that change in it that you would run instead of notepad++.exe\n. Tested in version 7.5.8 on 26 September 2018.  Still exists.\n@VladLazarovici 's case I problem seems to originate from the \"Clear all marks\" button press action not being recorded into the macro.  Indeed if you try to record ONLY that action in a macro, it results in Playback begin greyed out when you go to test it.\nCase II adds the complication of inversing bookmarks.  That action also appears to not be recorded into the macro.  Again, if you try to record ONLY that action in a macro, it results in Playback begin greyed out when you go to test it. . Followup on Case II:  Even though you can't record the inverse-bookmarks command (value is 43050) into a macro, the action will work if you hand-edit shortcuts.xml and insert the following into an existing macro where you want the inversing of bookmarks to occur:\n<Action type=\"2\" message=\"0\" wParam=\"43050\" lParam=\"0\" sParam=\"\" />. >It's still a nasty misbehaviour\nDisagree.  Keycombinations in editing tabs are remappable via the Shortcut Mapper.  These keycombos are NOT active when Find family of windows has input focus.  So hardbinding F3 in the Find window...does it really make sense? Not to me..

Wow.  I have been using Notepad++ for quite a while and I NEVER noticed this before.. It IS a deficiency; UNDO followed by REDO is the known workaround to return you to your desired place..

Leave column mode by arrowing with shift+alt.  Ultraedit probably maintains column mode status without something like shift+alt being done continuously; Notepad++ takes a different approach.. Also discussed here:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/13877/issue-3316-can-anyone-else-reproduce. @Woidla27 \"...combined with sort...\".  Yea, okay, that works when a sort of your data is valid.  For when you can't sort, this type of remove duplicate lines is of very limited use.. With the relatively new (I think 7.4.2 and beyond) ability to resize the Find dialog window, I think I like this!  Without that ability I would have to agree with @Ede123 's \"most importantly\" comment.. Wow, this is so old I'd forgotten about it.  VERY coincidentally, just yesterday I implemented a Pythonscript solution so that I can have this behavior with any Notepad++ version.  Yay for me, especially since Don deep-sixed it! \n\n. >I can't believe this is closed\nI think it is closed because people are mixing line-endings via replace and this creates a bad situation for sort.  As long as line-endings are uniform, sort doesn't have any problems (well, the complained-about problem at least).. Search and replace has nothing to do with it...except apparently it is a vehicle to get mixed-line endings in there...which is not a valid scenario.. Why don't you elaborate on what exactly is going on when \"this problem also occurs when Compare is not installed\"?. If one traces through the history on this, one will see:\n\n\npre-7.4.2 had up/down direction radiobuttons; up gets disabled when reg exp search mode is selected (has been this way since around version 6.3)\n\n\n7.4.2 got rid of up/down direction radio buttons and added \"<  >\" buttons; \"< <Find\" gets disabled when reg exp search mode is selected (mimicing the pre-7.4.2 behavior)\n\n\n7.5 got rid of the \"<  >\" buttons and added the backward-direction checkbox; this checkbox gets disabled when reg exp search mode is selected (mimicing the earlier behavior)\n\n\nThus, I don't see this as a real issue, unless the issue author is contending that the behavior since 6.3 is wrong.  I don't because I see backward regular expression searches as a \"bad thing\".  Regular expression engines are designed to work from a given position forward, not backward.  If we consider the current caret position, we have a definite starting point for the engine.  If one contemplates going backward from the caret, what should the starting point be?  If it is backward one character at a time until a regex match based upon that starting point is found, that is pretty burdensome on the regex engine and could lead to some really long search times.  That is my best guess as to why backward regex searching is disallowed (and I agree with it being that way).. Worth noting is that although upward/backward regex searching has been disabled via the Find dialog since 6.3, regex searches upward/backward with the \"Find Previous\" menu command (\"Search\" menu) or its default shortcut key (Shift+F3) have worked in every version from 6.3 to 7.5.  It would really be nice to clear up this inconsistency, one way or the other!. @bahusoid Closed without explanation?; it was YOUR issue.. I agree fully that this is an issue; best workaround I've found is to quit and restart Notepad++ to get rid of the (red)marking while keeping the bookmarking.. @thezoggy , what is meant by '\"In selection\" default to uncheck by default'?. @thezoggy ... well, yea, I know where it is.  I guess what I mean is that for me it is always unchecked by default so I didn't know what you meant.  Still don't...\nOkay, wait, seeing some weird behavior with it now...will try to track it down.... Interestingly, there seems to be a \"data amount trigger\" that determines if \"In selection\" gets checked upon ctrl+h getting invoked (from the replace window initially being closed).  If I try it with a small amount of data selected first it comes up unchecked, but if I do a larger amount I see what you are saying.  I don't know if it is a number of lines thing yet or a number of bytes thing.... ah, got it from the source code...if there are 1024 or less bytes selected \"In selection\" will be unchecked...greater than 1024 and it gets checked.\n. A better forum for this question would be the Notepad++ Community web site:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/. I'm finding, from a fresh N++ 7.5 (32bit) unzip, but of course with the addition of \"Multi-Editing\" Enable'd, that I can't duplicate the behavior you are seeing.  It adds the 2nd, 3rd, etc carets without doing any text selecting.\n. Not related to #3533; see my comment there.  This current issue has to do with a deviation from consistent behavior since version 6.3. . Added \"at N++ startup\" to issue title to hopefully clarify.  This is only a problem at startup when Reg Exp search mode was the last search mode used in the prior N++ run of the program.  [The search mode gets saved into the find-history, and is restored in the next N++ run.  However, the disabled state of the backward-direction checkbox isn't set at next startup after the code restores the search mode.]. It may be worth pointing out that Notepad++ ships with exactly ONE preconfigured macro (on the Macro menu).  It is called \"Trim trailing space and save\".  It can be assigned to any keycombo, including the normal one for \"Save\".  Thus I think the bulk of your feature request already exists in a usable form (I use it, at least).. @dinkumoil -- yes, but I reserve the toolbar icon save for when I do need to save with trailing spaces intact  :). This feels like a plugin issue to me, not a core Notepad++ issue--in which case maybe reporting it as an issue here is not the right thing to do?  (I'm asking). I doubt such a change will ever be made.  In software development, there is something called \"continuity\"--you don't change an established norm that people are used to unless there is a very serious compelling reason to do so, and this doesn't qualify.  Anyway, you as a user can customize the text of the Find dialog box windows to have whatever you want (within space limits)--for example, here is what mine is configured to look like:\n. Closed as perfect duplicate of #3391. Not reproducible with portable v7.3.3 and portable v7.5.1, both 32 bit.. It might be worth noting here that you can already do this, although only in the DOWNWARD direction, with a regular expression search.  As an example, say that \"Lorem\" appears somewhere between the caret and the end of file.  Searching for (?s).*?Lorem will select text from the caret point through and including the first match of Lorem.. You are within your rights to request this as a feature.  However, your request may not be implemented due to other priorities of the developers, it may not be implemented for years, or the developers may not see the same value in having this feature as you do.  Given all that, there are existing ways of reversing lines (as an example:  https://sourceforge.net/p/npppythonscript/discussion/1199074/thread/e61f36ec/). This is not an issue (yet).  This is a question.  Perhaps it is better to ask it here:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/. Well, I was hoping to get some discussion going about it where a lot more people will see it (on that website I linked), and maybe someone will understand what you are meaning (I don't).  If it is decided to be an issue, it can always come back here with a refined explanation.. Okay, I think I understand.  You want a capability to convert your text so that only tab characters exist before the first non-whitespace character on each line, with any tab characters existing after the first non-whitespace character to be converted to spaces.  That could be a menu item--to run that conversion on existing text.  Or do you want this capability dynamically, like this is a \"setting\" for the current file, and as you type the above rules are enforced?  Or maybe you'd like to see  both.... Why did you create this current issue when you are the author of #3251 ?  Ugh...adds to the clutter in this issues list.... Perhaps you should consider another editor that meets your need better.  Regardless, I think you have defined your desire well and it will be taken under consideration for implementation.  If you have more comments after a period of time elapses, please add them to THIS issue and don't create another new one.. Can you provide an example?. So when considering the topic issue, if I try sorting your sample file with Notepad++, it sorts correctly as far as I can tell.  The mixed line endings remain and don't seem to cause any sorting order problems, for me.\nAs to how you get mixed line endings in the first place, that is unclear to me from your description.. I did some testing with copying out of the Find result panel and pasting into an editor window.  I didn't see any inconsistent line-ending behavior with doing this--the pasted text always had line-endings that followed whatever line-ending type was set for the file.  Thus, although I'm not saying I don't think it is happening the way you say it is for you, I can't duplicate your behavior.. Okay, the sort after undo as discussed above does not seem to do a valid sort.  This is fairly obscure.  Mixing line ending types in a single document is ill-advised at best.  Normally you shouldn't do this on your own and Notepad++/Scintilla in most cases will convert data pasted with improper line endings to line-endings of the current configuration.  There are some cases where you can get Linux line-endings into a Windows document (example: copying from a Pythonscript console window, and then pasting into an editor tab via the Clipboard History panel), but really it is pretty rare.  Maybe we should discuss further how you are getting inconsistent line-endings in your doc--try to pin that down?. for 1:  I think you have to try to quantify the \"Sometimes\" part to something more specific before someone can help or even think about trying to fix something in the source code.\nfor 2: This can happen and I think it is valid/okay.  N++ isn't going to stop you if you really want to have mixed line-ending types in your document.  I know this is not what YOU want, though.\nI still think nailing down the original source of the non-Windows line-endings getting in is key; my 2c.. Workaround:  From an active editor tab window, if you use the F7 (the default) keystroke for Search (menu) -> Search Results Window, it will take you back to the Find Result panel and place the highlight where it last was.  From there it is easy to go to the next/previous one.  Even better, don't go to the Find Result panel at all--use F4 or Shift+F4 to go to the next or previous search result without leaving the active editor tab.  See Search (menu) -> Next Search Result and Search (menu) -> Previous Search Result. Agreed.  However I thought I'd present the \"workaround\" so that you wouldn't suffer (in case you [or other readers] didn't know about it...) while you are waiting for your perfectly reasonable feature request to be implemented.  . Not a deprecated feature.  Check Settings -> Preferences -> Backup.  Tick \"Enable session snapshot and periodic backup\".  With that ticked Notepad++ will not prompt you to save unsaved tabs, and will still have them when you run Notepad++ the next time.. Your description lacks sufficient detail.  There are a number of valid reasons why what you've described would result in \"Nothing found\".  See this:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14567/search-and-replace-failed/3. TextFX is a plugin, and not included in the Notepad++ distribution.  Consequently, bugs or feature requests regarding it should be reported elsewhere.  This list is for core Notepad++ issues.  Recommend closure of this issue.. Well, Pythonscript might even be overkill here, if simply looking for an alternate way to remove blank lines.  How about Notepad's native Edit (menu) -> Line Operations -> Remove Empty Lines choices (there are TWO of them)?. Suggest you change your replacement text to \\1'\\); and try again.  Note the \\) where you only had ) \nboost::regex 1.42\u20131.65 truncates the replacement string when encountering a closing parenthesis without a matching opening parentheses. You were right with your first sentence.  Recommend closure of this issue.\n\"really pissed\" -> You do realize Notepad++ comes to you for $0.00?  I guess even for that price you can be pissed, but probably better to internalize that viewpoint.. It's all pointless as the plugin mgr is on its way toward being an inhouse product...it is being rewritten currently.. It's all good.  Just gotta wait on it.... FWIW, doesn't reproduce in my Win7(64):\nNotepad++ v7.5.1   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Aug 29 2017 - 02:35:41\nPath : C:\\xxxxx\\npp.7.5.1.bin\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : ON\nOS : Windows 7 (64-bit)\nPlugins : mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll \n. Although I'm not affected by the \"problem\" part, I sort of like the idea to see where the caret is when N++ doesn't have the input focus, but only if it is, as @theREALdebater suggests, visually different from the normal input caret (so I don't get tricked into thinking anything I type will go into N++).  Presume this is a Scintilla concern so we may be barking up the wrong tree.... Where does your expectation that ctrl+backspace should remove the previous word come from?  Maybe a bad example, but in Microsoft's Notepad.exe, in the Find box, ctrl+backspace also adds a rectangle symbol.. The only reason that it removes the word in the N++ main window is that it is tied to the Scintilla command for SCI_DELWORDLEFT in the default keymapping.  If you unmap it via the Shortcut Mapper, it will also insert a \"rectangle\" in the N++ main window.  This rectangle appears to be a character with byte value 127/0x7F, at least in my trial.  Anyway, you are free to ask for this change in functionality, and you've certainly built a case for it (and I do like it!), but I just wanted to point out that, in general, don't expect keycombos that work in normal N++ document editing mode to work for the other controls in the N++ user interface.  These controls are normally just simple Windows controls, and as such, don't have extra functionality (I wasn't surprised that N++'s find box and Notepad.exe's Find box handle ctrl+bs the same way).  . It isn't unpalatable.\nIssues can be feature-requests or bug-reports.\nIt's fine.. @scootergrisen I think it probably could be scripted if you have interest in that kind of solution.. @blackboxlogic I don't really know what to say to your bullet point list, but a positive for the first half of the 4th is that you would be taking action that doesn't depend upon anyone but you.  :)\nAnd at the very least you would always have those changes and could make a patched version of Notepad++ any time you wanted.. Someone else pointed out to me that Shift+Ctrl+LeftArrow followed by Delete will approximate the desired behavior...maybe a workaround.... Yep, but this area is for all types of discussion about the title topic.  And noting some workarounds (to shorten the obvious way of doing things) if they exist might be useful to some future readers.  [I couldn't tell if you were being funny or insulting my comment (from the high quality of your earlier posts you don't fit the mold for the latter).]  Cheers.. It's a good request.  I hope it gets implemented as well.. This is because the Find/Replace/Files/Mark dialog defines \"underlined-R\" twice, once on the Replace page, and once on the Files page.  It just so happens that the processing for the Files page happens first, so that's what happens in your scenario.  This would be a simple fix--just eliminate the duplication.  \nWhile you are waiting for this fix to be implemented you can redefine the \"underline\" keys yourself to avoid your \"scary\" situation--see here for how to do this:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/11041/new-alt-shortcuts-in-the-find-dialog-for-default-english-language\nBy the way, if this were working, it is best to do Alt+R instead of simply R.  The reason is that if focus happens to be where you don't expect it (example, on the find-what or replace-with input boxes), R by itself will remove what was in the selected box, and replace it with an R!  Alt+R will always invoke the \"underlined\" function--again, if it were working correctly.. Assuming we are talking about a Localization that is \"English\"-like, I found that if you switch to \"English (customizable)\" in a default install, the \"Replace in Files\" no longer has an underline key in it.  This gives us some more insight (and can work around the original problem).  The original problem IS real, no doubt, which may stem from the Find window's general oddness.  For example, the checkboxes that appear visually to be common among tabs are truly only ONE checkbox in the code (which kind of goes contrary to how you'd think it would be laid out at design time--normally a \"tab\" is a container, and its children belong ONLY to it...).  A lot of history here, I think.... So I think what makes the request difficult is how far can the found text move from the position at the time of find (due to future edits) before the program logic throws up its hands and says \"I don't know where it is\"?.  Or maybe the originally found text itself is edited/deleted so it isn't locatable at all.  Tough problem to solve (unless every position change since the exact time of each search the user could access is recorded), thus maybe that is the reason it remains unsolved.\nPerhaps if it isn't exactly where it originally was, a command issued to move the caret to it should simply do nothing?\n[mikefitz's suggestions are good ones!  I've been using them for a long time.]. @TRNG98 \n\n\"Some one forgot to close the dialogue box\"\n\nIt is supposed to work that way.\nThe rest of your most-recent posting doesn't add any new information--it is understood what behavior you are seeking.. I'm not saying that it isn't a bug, but it is a long-standing bug.  Perhaps some are interested in a workaround:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/13762/disable-menu-activation-for-a-shortcut. It is hard to determine what will beep and what won't.  Alt+H is mapped to Hide Lines and that doesn't beep when invoked.  Alt+X is mapped to nothing by default...and it doesn't beep (but for some reason it closes the current tab!).  . Do you really mean \"view\"?  Of which there are exactly 2 (view0 and view1), created by the commands \"Move (or Clone) to Other View\".  \nOr do you mean these settings should be on a per-document (aka per-tab) basis?. Just asking...why would this be useful?. Suggest title change for this issue:  \"Allow forward slashes as directory separators in pathnames\". Suggestion while waiting for implementation:\nTwo one-line Pythonscripts. \nOne like this:\neditor.replaceSel(editor.getSelText().replace('\\\\', '/'))\nThe other like this:\neditor.replaceSel(editor.getSelText().replace('/', '\\\\'))\n. Yep but no other language except a Notepad++ scripting one is going to be as convenient WITHIN Notepad++.  I was just pointing that out as a workaround for those that may not know about the scripting support, or others that think feature requests are quick to be adopted.  Cheers.. It was a design decision to remove Plugin Manager from v7.5 onwards.. If we are going to make Issues out of website errors then we are really in trouble as the website is out-of-date in many, MANY places.  To think about it, with 1800+ issues we are already in serious trouble.. Duplicate of #3848 . Question for the developers:  In a text editor, don't line-ending characters, of whatever form (CR+LF, CR, LF), trump all other definitions?  In other words, if these sequences occur, aren't they considered line-endings no matter what other contextual sequencing happens to be there?. Duplicate of #3841 . It appears that the \"Characters (without blanks)\" value being reported is actually \"Characters (without line-endings)\".\nProof (for a document with multiple lines):\nStep 1: Do a regular expression COUNT search on (?s). and note the value reported is the same as the \"Current document length\" value\nStep 2:  Do a regular expression COUNT search on (?-s). and note the value reported is the same as the \"Characters (without blanks)\" value\nThe difference in the searches is the Step1 search will count line-ending characters and the Step2 will exclude line-ending characters. @Sinhov \nI would start by doing a \"find-in-files\" on the codebase for some text that appears in the View (menu) -> Summary popup window.  For example, search for (without blanks):.  This would get you quickly to the area of code that does this processing and you can study it and decide how to change it.  Good luck.. Sometimes changes are slow to be adopted.  \nIt is possible to obtain your desired count by doing a Find-Count in regular expression search mode for \\S:\n\nIt is also possible to script a solution and have a running count of non-blank characters in the status bar.\nBut these are workarounds, not cures.. @teswarchandra \nWhat is your \"Search mode\" setting?  If it is not \"Normal\" you will get exactly what you've described and that is correct behavior.. How is your \nPreferences -> Backup -> Remember current session for next launch\nconfigured?  Checkbox checked or unchecked?. This is not an \"issue\".  Ask this as a question here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/. Have you considered scripting this?  I ask because it would be fairly easy to script and is a pretty obscure usage--meaning unlikely to be adopted (but I don't decide what does/doesn't get adopted).. So is your team all willing to use the 32-bit version of Notepad++ and the Pythonscript plugin?  For what I have in mind you would turn OFF the normal verbose backup functionality and just set up a script to run on every save of a file.  Note that this would be slightly different from the verbose backup function--that creates a copy of the file BEFORE changes--the script idea would create a snapshot of the file in its current state.  Depending upon your need that might be better anyway.  Anyway if that is all acceptable the script is rather trivial so let me know and I'll help you move forward.. @dail8859, yea, everybody thinks the specific way they want to do things should be made a feature in the standard product.  But...open-minded people like the OP of this issue can see the wisdom of other means.  I'll give them a little Pythonscript example here soon to help get them on their way.  This need is similar to something I already do, so pretty easy to help.. This bit of code should do it.  Questions on it are welcome.  Basically, if you put this in Pythonscript's startup.py (or put it in another file and call it from startup.py), it will install a hook to the FILESAVED event to do the custom actions.

I like to double-click, pause to make sure what is now selected is what I want, then click it and drag it somewhere else.  :). Any time you have a non-zero amount of text selected, be it a normal stream selection or a column block, any action that will create text (examples:  keypress, paste, \"column editor\" insert, etc) will cause the original selection to be wiped out first.  This is expected behavior--and by design.\nSo a valid set of steps for your action might be:\n1. create a zero-width column block (also known as \"thin caret\") at a given column and covering \"n\" lines (be in INS rather than OVR mode--see far right of status bar)\n2-4. same as yours\nExpected/actual behavior from that would be that your text was inserted at the thin caret column but only on the \"n\" lines touched by the thin caret.. That text COULD dynamically change based on current INS or OVR mode...or if a selection is currently active...good point.  I think it is the way it is because most people spend 99% of their time in Insert mode so this is the way the developer thought of it when originally it was coded.\nIf you are happy with the explanation can you Close this issue?. Another thought:  The only reason the \"Text to Insert\" feature exists is so that you can easily insert text at a given column in the entire document.  Otherwise just do the \"thin caret\" thing in the desired column on the lines you want and simply start typing--whatever you type will be inserted (or overwritten) on every line originally touched.  In other words, no need to invoke Alt+C. I don't see any inconsistency with how the feature works and what your screenshot shows....can you maybe explain exactly where (in the screenshot) you aren't seeing what you expect to see? . The \"Find result\" panel lists exactly one hit in each if its lines.  Notice that it has TWO line 10, TWO line 11, and at least FOUR line 20 (I think there will be 9 line 20 in total).  This is expected current behavior.  The way I think you expect to see it, there should be unique line #s in the Find result panel, with multiple yellow highlighting per line.  This is okay if you are making a feature/change request, but I still think what it shows is consistent with how it currently is designed to work.  Just pointing it out.... Maybe this is better addressed by having application level control on the sound.  What I mean by this (and I'm on Win7 so if later versions treat it differently this may not be relevant) is to change Notepad++ so that when opening the \"sound\" control (e.g. from the speaker icon in the tray) Notepad++ appears there (currently it doesn't) and one can set the sound settings from it.  Maybe this is overkill since N++ makes so few sounds, but I always lean towards solutions that don't involve adding another Preferences setting.  :). See #3902.  Recommend closure.. FWIW, this is a one-liner using the Pythonscript plugin:\neditor.setEdgeColumn(editor.getColumn(editor.getCurrentPos()))\n...or okay, a bit more if you want it to toggle on/off, but I'd say use it and then put it away at column 1 when you are done.  :-). I'm not 100% sure on this but I think Scintilla (which Notepad++ uses as its underlying text editing component) only supports a single vertical edge.  I could be wrong, but if not then your feature request would have to go to the Scintilla feature request process before N++ could even consider adding it.\nRegarding \"move it back\", the Python code could be changed to toggle between where you want it NOW and where you want it NORMALLY.  :-). @DedicatedTools \nSee here for how to assign keyboard shortcuts so that they run Pythonscripts:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14703/run-python-script-pythonscript-plugin-with-a-shortcut\nIt seems like you now have a pretty good solution...maybe not ideal, but pretty good.  :). Ok, so this isn't an \"issue\", this is you not knowing how to use the software.  In the future please don't clutter the already overwhelmed issues list with stuff like this.  This is a question and is best asked on either the Live Support forum (https://gitter.im/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus) or the Community forum (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/), both of which you can access via the \"?\" menu inside Notepad++.\nIn the event you do have a true issue, to be taken seriously you have to follow the template for reporting an issue, not jam your issue details all in the title of the issue and leave the template empty.\nModerator:  PLEASE CLOSE THIS ISSUE.\nOk, so as to your real problem, it is very likely that you are editing files with Windows line endings, thus you have to search for \\r\\n\\r\\n and replace with \\r\\n to do what you are attempting in Extended search mode.. Correct forum link (so that you can click it):  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14527/last-line-has-crlf-or-not/2. Does anybody read the user interface of the programs they use?  Follow Current Doc checkbox, just to the right of the box you specify your Directory to search in.. @operasfantom I believe that @niviman is talking about Windows' Batch files programming language.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file. @niviman I don't judge!  :). NppFTP is not distributed with Notepad++.  Thus bug reporting for it doesn't belong here anyway (only N++ and packaged plugins issues belong here).  Suggest you contact author of NppFTP.  The upside is that the issues list for that plugin is likely shorter than this one.  :)  If you suspect this is some sort of interaction issue between N++ and the plugin (can't tell, don't use it myself), then I suppose the issue belongs in both places.. Works okay for me (7.5.2 x86 portable).  What you are seeing is consistent with the operation on a never-saved file, for what that's worth.  The stuff you aren't seeing is generated inside the following \"if\" block:\nint fileLen = curBuf->getFileLength();\nif (fileLen != -1)\n{\n// generate file-system info about the file\n}\nFor a never-saved file getLength() will return -1.  Not saying this is what you're seeing, just my observations.. This is not the place to report problems with plugins that are not bundled in with Notepad++ itself.  Recommend closure.. @Yousha you said you preferred not to use it anymore 5 days ago...what brought you back? :)  Technically your new complaint is totally separate and different than your earlier one.  At least the new one involves the standard product but you should probably change the title of the issue as a console window is not involved anymore.. How do you know your UDL is okay? Was it working with an earlier version of Notepad++?. Maybe it should not ship with ANY commands mapped to shortcut keycombos.. @dail8859 \nWell, if you hack config.xml before running...\n\n. Feature request noted but maybe give the NavigateTo plugin a look; maybe it eases some of your pains?  See https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/12892/navigateto-navigate-between-files-tabs-quickly-like-a-ninja-d. Didn't mean to open a can of worms for you.  Confession: I don't use that plug-in, I just remembered reading that others found it useful.  If you work with it some more and still can't get it going, I suggest you contact its author if possible.  Unfortunately (but properly) you can't pursue 3rd party plugin problems in THIS forum.  Your request above for modifications to the standard product will remain here for consideration, however.. If the text you search for isn't found in any files, it says \"0 hits in 0 files\".  This leads me to believe that the \"in y files\" part tells the number of files with hits, not the total number of files examined.  If that's the case, then maybe a nice enhancement would be to change it to output \"x hits in y files (z files searched)\" or some such.... I like it as an enhancement.  Maybe change title of issue to \"Add file count searched to Find-result panel entry\"?  Or maybe this already exists as another issue (I didn't check).. This new feature would help the situation where you have not set the correct \"Filespec\" to search for on the Find-in-Files tab--if you have this wrong you at first may be led to believe that your find-what expression is wrong or there were no hits.  If it said \"0 files searched\" that would be a big clue that the filespec or the starting directory is wrong and the find-what expression is fine.. So as a workaround to see how many files will be impacted by a search you can run a Find-in-Files or a Find-All-in-All-Open-Docs on the regular expression (?-s).\\Z.  This will generate output of \"(N hits in N files)\" where N is the number of non-zero-length files searched.. It seems that the simpler \\z works as well for this workaround.. Works for me; I get prompted.  Try a freshly unzipped portable install of 7.5.3 32-bit (if that's not what you did) and see if that works for you?. The oddball thing might be the ramdisk, try removing that from the mix if you can?. That is not a great feature request.  What math operations?  What is a \"column\" (a rectangular selection?)?  What's a \"whole\" column?. If you are just reporting it, that's fine; I'm sure it is a known issue here somewhere in the issues list.  However if it something that is driving you crazy constantly, you can workaround it yourself until it is fixed, probably by following the information here:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14860/function-list-empty-for-js-files. See #3620 for more info on the existing logic behind when \"In selection\" gets checked/unchecked by Notepad++. @TroglodyteGuy , It is clearly up for debate, but in my opinion that falls more in the realm of what goes in the Find-what zone...see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14048/improvement-for-replace-dialog for more.. @kmurray24 \nWell, you can currently leave it hanging around from day to day without having to save, although it would still have the current \"new #\" name to it.   Tick the \"Backup\" option \"Enable session snapshot...\" and then any \"new #\" tabs you have will persist from run to run of Notepad++.. @SinghRajenM I see you did PR #5311 for this and it looks like it might make it in.  I have many prewritten scripts that check a filename of \"new(space)(number\" to avoid doing actions on a tab that doesn't have a real disk file associated with it.  What is the best new criterion to check for for these type of files going forward?  Check for absence of backslash? What do you think?. What I was speaking of specifically was Pythonscript, doing a notepad.getCurrentFilename().startswith(\"new \"). Note the trailing space.  This works well as long as the existing scheme is in place.  So I guess I was a bit wrong when I said \"new(space)(number)\" (meaning in regex terms ^new\\s+\\d+).  I checked my scripts and I don't ever do the latter method, always the former.\nI was just musing on how to approach this if the rename tab thing gets adopted...  Probably best to check for file existence as you say.  Thanks for your thoughts.. First problem stems from the fact that the field width is assumed to be six (arbitrary choice?)\nSecond problem not reproducible with 7.5.3 32-bit portable.. I had fun trying to reproduce and crash it--couldn't, stopped around 300 tabs...  :)\n. Maybe make the Danish version of whatever text that is shorter?  :)\nChanging the height of the Prefs window wouldn't help.  That specific control's height would have to be increased.. If it really bothers you (which would surprise me---but you've made an issue of it, so....)...did you know that you can change it yourself for your current setup?  In the danish.xml file in the localization folder, look for id=\"6323\".  Change the text to whatever you want, then (possibly) restart and (possibly) reselect Danish as your language choice...should do it.. Don't mix up the \"Find\" feature with the \"Smart Highlighting\" feature.  They are 2 separate things that are totally unconnected.  That being said if you go into the Preferences for Highlighting and untick \"Match whole word only\", suddenly the inconsistency you describe will go away.  But again, unrelated, and no bug.  Recommend closure of this issue.. You're going at it backward.  You need to describe the issue here (following the template is a big clue as to how to do it), not solve it.  And no, '\"Find in finder\" localization bug' is not a sufficient issue description.. @softmgr Software projects of any decent size and/or longevity tend to look \"messy\" to outsiders.  But that's irrelevant to how users should report issues and attempt to add work (for acceptance) to the project.\n. I didn't know that the spec for Notepad++ was.....Windows Notepad.....Gulp!. When you say \"more than one window is open\", or \"move 3 tabs to a new window\", I believe what you mean instead of \"window\" is \"view\".\nRegardless, I tested the scenario under 7.5.3 and found no issue; a saved session with editor tabs in both views (primary and secondary) was saved and reopened correctly (tabs that were in each individual view were restored upon session load.. He implies that I \"don't know what a window is\" and yet he types up a whole issue concerning \"instances\" and never once uses that term?  Are you kidding me??  Idiotic.  Where do these people come from?. LOL. @DavidHansen-0x454d43 , No confusion--where in this issue thread do you think I responded to anything @MAPJe71 said?  I didn't.  No need.  @MAPJe71 knows what he's talking about, and uses the correct Notepad++ nomenclature to do it.  :)\nMy post that starts out 'He implies that I \"don't know what a window is\" and...' was a direct reply to @sorein 's posting that said \"Maybe you don' know what a window is. We users of Windows call a window...\".. Issue 2 probably exists because the controls are bigger than they need to be for multilanguage reasons--the translation into different languages is various length, so the controls are purposefully made really wide to support any possible need.. @DavidHansen-0x454d43 I think @KhunRoger was meaning that if you click the text of the label that is fine (as long as the Find window has focus) and should affect the control, but if you click in the apparent whitespace to the right of a control's text that should NOT affect the control.  I agree with that.\n. Reading closer, I see that @khunroger truly is advocating that only clicks on the checkboxes/radiobuttons themselves should cause something to happen.  I can't agree with that.  Clicking the text label of a cb/rb SHOULD affect the control, but clicking in the whitespace to the RIGHT of that text label should NOT.. I did some research trying to figure out what this is called, and it appears to be \"click through\" (see https://superuser.com/questions/1036217/disable-click-through-on-windows for one reference...).. @KhunRoger Your clock example makes more sense with the phrase \"click-through\".  So I guess that is one kind, and another kind would be what we are talking about here, where a first click anywhere (even over a control) on an inactive window should make the window active but not do the control action.  Just playing around I see that MS Word's menu bar will not change if it is clicked when the window is inactive, but an inactive Chrome tab will be changed to if you click it to activate the window.  These are just a couple of trials but already we can see the inconsistency.  :). @andreszs, so what is your example of a \"decent IDE\"?  Your last sentence is very true.. @KhunRoger For the record I wasn't advocating an \"integrated toolbar\".  I just don't like statements like \"any decent IDE\" without relevant examples of one/some.  . @KhunRoger So it occurred to me that there have been a number of complaints that \"Search is broken\" recently.  Example of one: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/14567/search-and-replace-failed\nCould it be that these people have done what you did, and messed up their search parameters by clicking to reactivate an inactive (and semi-transparent) window??  Then they don't notice the checkbox changes and when searches fail they get overzealous and claim that the search feature is broken?  I'm going to guess that this is the case!. @KhunRoger Yes, okay, good info...  I still think there are two separate but definitely related things under discussion here, and this back-and-forth has been constructive.  Thanks.. @KhunRoger For fun I prototyped a scripted solution to this, it is fairly easy to implement; hopefully it will be picked up by a Notepad++ developer at some point.  Let me try getting an animated GIF of the effect in here: \n\n. @KhunRoger I currently run 7.2.2 on a daily basis because it is stable and I don't have a compelling reason to upgrade.  That's why my animation had no Backward-direction checkbox.  All of the stuff we've been discussing about clicks that should simply activate a window actually changing control states is version-independent.  Hopefully my animation was clear, showing that when the Find window goes inactive, all of its controls are disabled.  When a click ANYWHERE on it activates the window, the previous enabled/disabled states of all of the controls are restored.  Since at the point of activation all controls are disabled, a mouse click is received ONLY by the window, not any of its child controls.  This achieves the goal.  Again, just a scripting solution as a proof-of-concept.  BTW, the text on my Find window is very much customized, I should have turned the default text back on before making that video to avoid confusion--oh, well.... Your issue is perfectly valid.  It has long been a known problem that using \\K in a regex replace has bugs, but usually the case is where \"Replace\" doesn't work and \"Replace All\" works fine.  This is the first time I've seen where the wrap-around option makes a difference when doing a simple \"Replace\".  Interesting.. @IEales , try asking such a simple thing on one of the forums next time.  So many issues we don't need more pure clutter here.. This is not an issue (at least for THIS issues list).  Please close.. Without commenting on the issue itself, I'd say the proper way to do this search/count is with the regular expression ^\\R. I think the overall \"problem\" is that the Count feature doesn't count a match if if has zero-length.  Since matches to ^$ are purely assertions, they are zero-length matches (you can see the little popup that is shown for that when doing an interactive find).  So for instance if one searches for \\b (word boundary assertion) a similar thing occurs.  I don't know if this an intentional way for the Count feature to work or not.  I can live with it working the way it does (think of it as \"Count non-zero length matches\" -- maybe that was considered and discarded because it wouldn't fit on the button.  :-D. Isn't this the same thing?:\nSTEPS: Buy 50m hose at store. Connect hose to spigot. Turn on spigot.\nACTUAL BEHAVIOR: It takes many seconds before water comes out of the end of the hose.\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Water instantly available.\nSometimes expectations may not be realistic.. So what kind of time are we talking about here? . > The plugin 'Explorer' (last version v1.8.2) causes also the same issue.\nI have been using this version of Explorer plugin for a long time with no such issue.  Doesn't mean anything, I guess, but I like this plugin a lot and don't want to see its reputation sullied.  :-P. @JAT86  Kind of obvious but how about clicking on the tab you want to go to with the mouse?  Or perhaps the LocationNavigate plugin helps you?  Or, if you have 9 or less tabs, the View (menu) -> Tab -> ____ could be of assistance (assign Ctrl+1 to \"tab1\", Ctrl+2 to \"tab2\", etc.\nYour arrows in your screenshot don't make much sense for the functionality you describe, as I would think they would walk a user through all of the tabs in order, not jump between first and last.  Maybe something like this would suit your desired functionality better (where I've marked what you want with blue splashes; sorry for the crude imagery):\n\n. @SinghRajenM Wow, that is fairly obscure...but it works!  Nice one.. The $0 and $1 cases work fine for me.  The others (/0) and (/1) don't make much sense, although if the /1 is supposed to be \\1 then that one also works ok for me.. I don't see the behavior discussed if it is merely a \"move mouse over underlying...\" action, but if I click on the underlying editor window the Command Line Arguments window definitely does go behind the editor window; whereas the Debug Info box does not (it stays on top) with similar actions performed.  Confirmed about the \"opened multiple times\" issue.. Remove the offending plugin's DLL file from the plugins directory; this will \"uninstall\" it.. First of all, it appears that you are talking about the \"code folding\" feature??  Secondly, the design is that folding is not remembered across Notepad++ runs.. You really should stop with the \"tray\" nomenclature--it is just confusing to anyone reading this that doesn't see my \"code folding\" comment above.  There may be a way to \"script\" the behavior you desire.  Let me look into that.. Ugh, WHY oh WHY is this issue clogging the list??. @tobozo, maybe you should use a more stable and reliable text editor.  Just a suggestion.. What if there were already 2 other instances?  How would it know WHICH other instance you wanted it to go to?\nBut, say you have exactly 2 instances running (the following also works with any number running, but let's keep it simple):  Try dragging an editor tab from one instance and dropping it on the other.  IT MOVES.  Which I think is what you are really asking for, right?  Problem solved?\nIf you drag the final editor tab out of an instance (so that after the drop that instance would have zero tabs), that instance will Close!  FYI.. Wow.  Good find!  To be clear, why don't you add in your Expected Behavior section what the final text SHOULD look like, in your opinion.. You're going to have to be more detailed in your issue report for anyone to understand it.  For example, it is valid for the caret to be in column 30 and the overall length to be 31.. Search (menu) -> Incremental Search\nSearch (menu) -> Go to.... Dreamers dream...  :)\n. To be taken seriously, you're going to have to put more work into it than 9 words.. Just curious...if one has, say 50 \"new\" documents floating around, how do you remember which one is which, either when you want to add some text to one, or when you are looking for something.  I've never understood the \"new\" document thing except for maybe a few seconds when you need to make one (only lasts a few secs. because I then give it a name and a location).. The only way I can duplicate the behavior you are seeing is by having the last line of the class not end with a line-ending (and being the last line in the file).  So technically your issue has merit, but for me I would just put the darned line-ending on.  :). @wsgr7962371 What does \"learn from\" mean, in this context?. @kludikovsky \nThe Plugin Manager is missing \"by design\" of the author of Notepad++.  Thus it is not, and cannot be, an issue.  Please close this issue.. @kludikovsky Sure, but one has to respect that the author/owner of a piece of software has the right to make design decisions for their product, even if unpopular.  This is even more true when said s/w costs $0.00  :-)\nIf you still haven't found the Plugin Manager, and need it:\nFAQ: How do I get the Plugin Manager back?? See http://bruderste.in/npp/pm/#install\n. @kludikovsky \nI don't know; currently the window gets populated when I try it.  Maybe better to purse on this forum where more people will see it (and thus your help-potential is increased):  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/. @chojrak11 If you use multiple instances of Notepad++ and don't close the 2nd, 3rd, etc instances BEFORE finally closing the original instance, your yellow setting will be unticked when you next run Notepad++, regardless of how you had it.  Could this be affecting you?. @lazair \nIt already works perfectly if I follow your 3 steps, except with the substitution of \"Shift\" for \"Ctrl\" in your 3rd step.\nCtrl+Lclick (plus the implied subsequent drag) is already used for the feature that allows you to create two or more non-contiguous selections.. @rus21andrey \nAssign it yourself in Shortcut Mapper.\nPLEASE CLOSE THIS ISSUE.. You should not be edting PDF files in Notepad++. I'm confused.  My shortcut mapper in 7.5.4 is not resizeable at all.  Does this issue (and PR) add resizing or does it enhance it?  Does it really need sizing capability?  Sure, it's not a negative if it sizes, but the default size seems pretty good (in other words I've never had a complaint-thought about it while using).. Hmmm... seems to be a \"judgement call\" on which file should have focus in this scenario.  I can see the logic of either way... Notepad++ has a -ro command line argument.  You can create your own right-click context menu (or a SendTo menu) item this way.. @dwbehror I can share with you what I do, maybe you want to do it the same, maybe not.  First, I don't allow Notepad++ to manage file associations as I see no need for that.  I create two Explorer right-click menu options (one for normal \"Edit with N++\", and one for read only \"Open RO with N++\"; I do this using the general technique show here:  https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-open-with-notepad-to-the-context-menu-for-all-files/ .  The command line for running Notepad++ for the editable case is the N++ exe path plus %1 and for the read-only case you simply add -ro to the command line: N++ exe path plus -ro %1.. Sometimes we just have to decide that the provided behavior is sufficient.. \"Feature request\"s are issues...but yours isn't going to be taken seriously because of its title.  You might also elaborate a bit on a use-case for your suggestion (that is, why it would be valuable to have).. @hnmcc What is different about your \"formAndControls\" function and your \"fetchAccountData\" or \"fetchServiceData\", etc functions?--the latter ones also start with \"f\" but seem to be put in function list correctly.... I see a similar behavior but not on the GUI elements you do.  I see it when trying to grab the sizers for adjacent subwindows.  It is annoying but I can still grab it and do the sizing I intend to do.. @Darelbi The way you have stated your scenario is untrue.  At time of paste, the line-ending characters in the to-be-pasted data are all converted to the line-ending format for the paste destination, i.e., the current editor tab buffer.  So, for example, if there are Linux line-endings in the clipboard and the file to receive the paste is a Windows file, the Linux LF will be converted to CRLF by the paste.  That being said, your desire to have no conversion happen when visible line-endings are turned on is OK.. @Darelbi So when Notepad++ opens a file, it makes a guess at what the line-endings are for the entire file.  If you start with a file that is mostly LF line endings and then you add some lines with CRLF line endings with Visual Studio....and then finally you open the file in Notepad++, it seems like it is guessing that your file has LF line-endings, so when you paste something in it converts the line endings on what is pasted to LF.  Sounds like correct Notepad++ behavior to me.  Attempting to mix line-ending types in general is asking for trouble, with Notepad++ or with other tools.  Do you have a valid reason for doing what you are trying to do?. The feature is called Smart Highlighting.. If you are open to workarounds, what I do is create a couple of Run menu entries to rename extensionless files to have an extension (.NOEXT) and change it back.  In between using these two I do my searching by specifying *.NOEXT as a filespec.  Very much a hack but it works.. You could use Begin/End Select instead of alt+shift_arrows or mouse.... @ZtrevorZ \nSo do the \"begin\" select like you would think you would (put the caret at top-left of your desired column first).  Then get your desired end-point on-screen and click it while holding Alt.  Then invoke the \"end\" select.  Note that the begin and end are both the same command (\"Begin/End Select\").  This should result in a column block being selected.. UGH.\n1. Who ever said ctrl+shift+o does something?\n2. Basic tenet of Windows knowledge is that 64-bit exes can't run 32-bit dlls (and vice versa)\n3. Being removed by design is not a \"problem\"\nPlease CLOSE this issue.. > 64bit version behaves completely different than 32bit version\nThis is untrue.\n\nTake this one if you have no idea which one you should take.\nBoth the 32-bit version and the 64-bit version say this.  It IS confusing.  :)\nIt is an evolution, though; someday the 32-bit version will go away (I suppose). How about putting a space between the : and the first / and just chilling out?. For a whole-word search to be considered valid, the first and last characters of the text to be searched for must be word characters, typically thought of as A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and underscore (and unicode equivalents).  Reference this for more information:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/13004/bugs-in-normal-search-for-v7-2-2-on-windows-7\n\nSince the question mark (inverted or not) is not a word character, this isn't a correct whole-word search, so results can be \"unexpected\".  \nRegarding your BabelPad comment, all I can say is \"Super! Use BabelPad\".  If you choose to use Notepad++, add how whole-word searches in it work to your knowledge database.. It does adhere to Unicode standards for what a word character and what punctuation are.  I think you are missing the point.  Since you know that punctuation is NOT a word character, it is up to you as the user to not specify it in the search box when you also specify \"whole word\" as a parameter.  Garbage in...garbage out.  You are certainly entitled to your own opinion on how this should work, but I can guarantee that this is known and accepted behavior and won't be changed.. My apologies.  I really did miss the point.  Somehow I thought the entirety of the complaint was a consequence of doing a whole-word search where you start the search text with a punctuation character.  This has come up before, maybe that's why I grabbed onto the notion of it.  Clearly, reading back now I see that that isn't it.\nIt does seem like the inverted question mark is being treated as a word-character here for this literal search.  And to go at your [[:punct:]] test another way, \\w won't match the inverted characters and \\W will, confirming that the regular expression engine indeed knows how to handle these.. Perhaps this is a Scintilla issue.  Notepad++ uses the Scintilla-provided function \"searchInTarget\" when finding text.  I tried it with the SciTE editor and it did not have the original problem:\n\nNote that SciTE uses an up-to-date version of Scintilla, whereas the Scintilla version in Notepad++ is considerably older.. @FatalBulletHit Get debug info on the ? menu\n? -> Debug Info...\nCopy it and paste it here. @Navi1982 Can you provide specific examples for \"(?=...) or similar tokens that dont capture matches\"?. @Navi1982 I don't think that example works.  It is asserting that the next thing to be found will be a \"word character\", but then the next thing is a \\r which isn't a word char.  So, never matches.\nI do see that replacing \\b\\r\\n with any literal text doesn't happen even though matches are found (interesting, indeed!), but since you hinted that there were other scenarios that worked like this I was interested in what they were.. More experimenting:\nDoing a replace-all on \\b\\r\\n with some literal text is successful.\nDoing an interactive (i.e., one at a time, using Replace button) replace on \\>\\r\\n with some literal text is not successful (same result as \\b\\r\\n ).\nDoing a replace-all on \\>\\r\\n with some literal text is successful.\nWhat does it all mean? :). \"...provides confidence that the product is carefully crafted.\"  :)\nThis is a good issue!. Look at the NPP status bar when your file is loaded and active (in the current editing tab).  If it doesn't say \"Windows CR LF\" it probably says \"Linux LF\".  You want it Windows for running batch files.  Double click that area of the status bar and a little window will pop up where you can select Windows.  Do that, save your file, then open in NP and you will see exactly what you were looking at in NPP.  20+ hours is a lot of time to spend on this!. This is not an issue.  To use literal ( or ) in the replace-with field with regular expressions, \\( or \\) must be used.  ( and ) have special meaning in the replace-with field.  Please close this issue.. Documentation is hard to find, but if an example suffices, one can be found here:\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/format/boost_format_syntax.html\nReference this:\n\"...the format string \"(?1foo:bar)\" will replace each match found with \"foo\" if the sub-expression $1 was matched, and with \"bar\" otherwise\"\nThe regular expression uses the ( here to start the special syntax.\nMaybe someone else can provide a better documentation reference than an example?. So here's a more direct reference:\nhttps://www.regular-expressions.info/refreplaceconditional.html\nChange the dropdowns at the top to say Boost as N++ uses the Boost regex engine.\nHere you'll see various cases where the ( and ) have special meaning.. Feels similar to #4278. FWIW:  Ctrl+Shift+s works perfectly fine for me in the same version of Notepad++.\nThe only obvious difference is that I don't have the PluginManager..... @whitten You might try a search on the code for IDM_FILE_SAVEALL.... @Fefo6644 maybe a dumb question, but are you sure it is mapped correctly via Shortcut Mapper?\n. When you report a bug make sure you are using the current version.  Nobody cares about a bug in 5 year old software--unless the current version IS 5 years old--in which case nobody cares anyway because it is dead software.. See shortcuts.xml ?. So you are probably absolutely right in everything you stated.  But...I can't help wondering...why are you pressing those buttons while you are in Notepad++?  Are you expecting them to do something besides what they currently do?. @CookiePLMonster That makes sense, but seems so annoying that you'd just toss that mouse in the nearest recycle bin (or seek out a global disable).  I mean, if you often hit the buttons by mistake, that probably outweighs their utility even in applications that do support their functions.. I think you're going to have to clarify a bit.  The way I read it, you have a file open in another editor and you have unsaved changes there.  Then you open the same file in Notepad++ and you are surprised that in Notepad++ you don't see the unsaved changes you are working on with the other editor.  Is that right?. So you are talking about features of the NppExec plugin, not Notepad++ itself, which is fine, but has no relation to \"Don\", as NppExec is not packaged with Notepad++ (probably it once was, but no longer).  So you could request that these special strings be added to base Notepad++...but history shows that functionality that exists in a plugin rarely if ever goes \"native\".\nBut the good news is that when I tried these special strings in NppExec version 0.6 beta 1....they WORK!  Give them a try and see if that doesn't solve your problem and allow you to close this issue.\n. @sinsedrix You cited \"NppExec.txt\".  Perhaps if you would install the NppExec plugin your problem would be solved?. No.  I'm not sure how you are inferring that.\nNppExec has its own \"run\" mechanism--it calls it \"Execute\".  You get to it via Plugins (menu) -> NppExec -> Execute...\nIt is there that the $(LEFT_VIEW_FILE), etc stuff works.\nOf course, all this relies on one actually installing NppExec.\nAs of this time, the newest version of NppExec is found here:\nhttps://github.com/d0vgan/nppexec/releases\nNppExec v0.6 beta 1. Works for me:\n\n. This is a desired feature.  A possible workaround might be to hold down the key that represents \"No\"...not sure what that is in your language.. @kemmis, Sure I understand frustration that this isn't released yet, but have you tried my workaround from above? Why would you let it \"drive you crazy\" ?. @Turtletronic Given Guy's writeup on the Community, if you agree that Notepad++ is acting acceptably in this regard, please close this issue.. @dinkumoil , you seem adept, and you understand this problem it seems...how about diving in and coming up with a PR that fixes it?  :). @dinkumoil Well, not to get too far off-topic, but your story sounds a lot like my story. :-)  Except for the Pascal/Delphi part:  I went the C++ Builder route, but in truth never delved too deeply into C++ (stuck to the basics of it that give you the biggest advantages...to avoid the \"blown up\" part you hint at).  Nowadays I'm more often called upon to do Python and that's OK with me.  I'm sure you would be comfortable working in the Notepad++ source code (IMO it is \"very light\" C++), but that's all I'll say.. @Anujg935 Actually, that's not quite right.  This part: \"X button does nothing when the new file you are working on is empty\".  Well okay, it's right but maybe for the wrong reason.\nIf there is only a single tab open and it is an unnamed file (e.g. new 1), the reason the X seems to do nothing is that one tab must ALWAYS be open in Notepad++.  \nIf you have 2 or more \"new \" files open and none of them have been modified, that X will close the one that currently has focus.  You can repeat pressing the X and closing \"new \" files until you get down to the last remaining one, which will not close.\nThus the X will close \"new _\" files that are empty, just not in the case where you only have one tab.. @SinghRajenM Yes good point; I got the feeling that @thebothead didn't want Notepad++ itself to close in the originally described scenario.. Sure looks visible to me, if you mean what's in the yellow highlight.. I don't know that there are any guarantees that translated (i.e., non-English) text will fit.  This is a tough problem to solve (limited space on the GUI and translations often differ greatly in length).  If you have a suggestion for shorter but still meaningful text for this field that will fit, by all means please indicate what that is--it may be adopted for future releases.. I wouldn't be hopeful about a such a solution.  The unwritten design rule seems to be \"optimize the sizes for English; other languages are abbreviated (if needed) to fit\".  Just my observation.. You can't be taken seriously with an issue titled \"A suggestion\" and with a two-sentence suggestion.  Advise you to change the title and provide examples.. I like the picture but I am unsure what it is saying.  The title of the issue perhaps gives a better hint.  You'd like to see each individual language (e.g. javascript, python, c, the list goes on...) as individually assignable shortcut keys?. It has worked this way as long as I've been using Notepad++.  It's meant to be a temporary thing.  But who knows...there is no documentation about it that I know of.. A large variety of sorting options doesn't seem to be a priority for Notepad++ development.  Suggestion:  Do what I did and script something; or create a mini-wrapper around CMD.exe's sort command. @mlatushko I don't know the answer to that; I was only offering up options (which you probably already knew).  Your issue remains as a placeholder, and if the developers choose to implement it, then this issue will likely be tagged with that activity.. Maybe the BetterMultiselection plugin helps you...or possibly the script discussed here:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/11360/multi-selection-and-multi-edit. @qiulanzhu That's why I said \"maybe\"; sorry that it didn't meet your need.. This is a long-known behavior.  The long-known workaround is to start your editing work at the LAST hit and then move UPWARD in the hit list for further edits.  I know this won't make you happy.  And it in no way reduces the validity of your issue.. So a known workaround to this, is after doing your replace (single), switch back to the editor tab and do an Undo than a Redo (use keystrokes).  Your caret will be left where the substitution occurred.  Ideal? Nope.  Workable? Well, I find it to be.. >I used the workaround for quite some time, but I am fed up with it.\nHere's another workaround that can be handy, but you won't like:  Press Replace All.  The screen doesn't change so you can see your first replacement.  You can undo it like the other workaround and then continue on...\n\nWhat makes it so difficult to split the button into two button...\n\nNothing.\n\nWhy is it such an extraordinary request...\n\nIt isn't.. It is not \"unknown what we find as a result\".  The \"Find result\" panel shows what makes up the hits in special color (default is red foreground and yellow background).\n\n. Ummm...well, Notepad++ is a text editor, not a hex/binary/exe editor...  It is not going to do things well that are out-of-scope...\n\n. If you have never changed the Localization setting, the ellipsis is present.  However, changing it to English (even though it says it is already set to English) or English (customizable), or probably many other possible choices, results in NO ellipsis (same for things like File -> Open and File -> Save and probably others...no ellipsis after the text).. Dude, seriously?  Pick one you like and add it!\n\n. @T-Reagan , another point: consider using the View (menu) -> Monitoring (tail -f) feature for what you are doing manually with the reload command?. INFORMATIONAL: Under Windows 7, if you change the Files of type box to show *.txt files, it won't show you anything except those files, so it is impossible to try this via step 3 above (selecting a file that is not .txt).. >The rest of the world is using windows 10?\nClearly that is NOT the case; you should think about WHY that might be?  Despite your ignorance on that point, Windows 7 is fully supported by Notepad++, so it is relevant data point for issues.. Thanks.  Glad to provide it.. Ugh.  Please close this issue.. Notepad++ is a Windows application.  Please close this issue.. No.  And you are asking a question, not reporting an issue.  Questions don't belong here.  \nIf you are making a feature request, please put the effort in to make it sound like a feature request, fill out more details, etc.. ...and you had no luck changing the colors to something acceptable using Style Configurator?. Note that even if Scintilla decided to implement this change, Scintilla updates are not pulled into Notepad++ on a regular basis.  In fact I believe the version of Scintilla that Notepad++ 7.5.6 uses is several years old!  :(. Possibly related to #4255. As you have been informed, this is not controlled by Notepad++ but rather by Scintilla.  There is nothing to be done for it unless/until Notepad++ adopts a Scintilla version that supports this.  Thus, technically you should make a request that Scintilla be updated rather than this request.  But..., I'm sure that there is already an issue requesting a Scintilla update.  Even that is not really needed as the Notepad++ author is well-aware of the status of the primary Notepad++ component.  He chooses when to update Notepad++ with a new Scintilla version, and apparently hasn't felt the need to do so in a number of years--nothing to be done for it.. @fml2 Well, yes, that can be done and has been done, but that just fragments the community of users...plus it becomes a lot of work for the forkers.. Do you have any of the \"backup\" features turned on?  If so, can you try turning them off and then trying your scenario again as a test?  It is a known issue that the backup feature can cause similar behavior to what you are seeing.. You only addressed the case where this status is set via the Edit menu option.  What's your feeling about when a file with the OS's read-only attribute is set on a file that gets opened in Notepad++ ?  I would presume you'd want to see the same \"lock\" icon, but it is your feature to define.  :). It works (kind of) analogously like the Home key does at the start of a line:\n1st Home press: move caret to first non-whitespace character of line\n2nd Home press: move caret to column 1\nkeep pressing Home: jump between those positions\n1st End press (in ww mode with current line wrapped and not on last \"visual line\" of the wrapping): move caret as you stated (just before the soft line break)\n2nd End press (same conditions): move caret to very end of line\nkeep pressing End: caret stays at very end of line\nAnyway, I'm reasonably sure this is a Scintilla thing and not a Notepad++ thing.. @AngeloMascaro You can get more info on the exact meaning of these and more from here: http://pygtksci.sourceforge.net/reference/keybindings.html.  I know that it was good for me to just do a \"refresher\". :). Doubtful. It has developed a \"history\" for being the way it is in Notepad++.  And the fact that the user can change it if desired really makes it a \"meh...\" kind of thing. :). I second the opinion: \"implement your improvement and submit a pull request\". In this scenario there is nothing to save.  Note that after step 1 the disk icon on the \"new #\" editor tab is blue (which indicates there is nothing to save).  If you wish for your steps to give you the popup, in between step 1 and 2 type a character into the editor window and then press Backspace.  After that the icon will be red and initiating a save will cause the popup to happen.  Please close this issue.. Because there is nothing to save before making some kind of change.  :). OMG!. If that is all the information that is going to be provided, moderator please close this issue.. Seems to work as the OP says from 7.3.2 all the way thru and including 7.5.3.  Doesn't work from 7.5.4 onwards.. @bnote No need to add it to the title\n. Agreed that this is annoying.  And it is an easy enhancement:  In FindReplaceDlg.cpp there are two references to SCI_SETCARETLINEVISIBLE.  If these are changed to SCI_SETCARETLINEVISIBLEALWAYS then it provides your \"Expected Behavior\".. @Yaron10 \nMy experimentation with the source showed that replacement was fine, but obviously adding it does no harm.  In fact, currently I run unmodified N++ with a Pythonscript that can only add the SCI_SETCARETLINEVISIBLEALWAYS call.. @Yaron10, It was a bit of time ago that I tried it; perhaps my memory is faulty.  If you are trying it now and it needs both, that is good data for anyone really attempting to add this feature enhancement in a PR--you?  Unfortunately I no longer have a build environment set up to re-test it.. @Yaron10 \n\nYou? :)\n\nWithout a build environment, clearly the answer to that is No.. @Yaron10 @cmeriaux \nMy C++ windows programming skill is up to most tasks, but it's the \"very hard to have a PR accepted\" thing which brings my desire to a dead stop.... I understand that this is a feature request and that you'd probably like to see a nice \"preference\" setting for the # of remembered search terms.  At the moment the known workaround is to change the nbMaxFindHistoryFind value in config.xml.. @davidheff You are not alone.  There is probably already an issue open about this; I didn't search.. Duplicate of #3329 and I'm sure others.  Please search for existing issues before creating new ones.. >please remove column for file extension and add it to filename.\nTick this:  Preferences -> General -> Document List Panel -> Disable extension column. I don't see this issue in 7.5.6 ; for me the text remains in Notepad++ and only a copy is put in the address bar of (in my case, Chrome).  Perhaps a clue would be in the \"Debug Information\" you didn't supply.. Note that this behavior (the overwrite prompting) only occurs if this setting is unticked:\nPreferences -> Default Directory -> Use new style dialog...\nEven though you get prompted, confirming the \"replace\" doesn't destroy anything...you find yourself changed to the desired directory and now the complete path to the directory (including a trailing backslash) is in the File name box (and it is selected so a keypress wipes it out).\nBut yeah, the prompt IS confusing.\n@GalacticStarfish Suggest you change to \"new style dialog\" and never look back.  :). Preferences -> Default Directory -> Use new style dialog...\nIf you tick that option, your problem seems to go away when I test it.\nNot sure who likes the \"old style\" dialog but I guess backward compatibility in user-interface changes is a concept that never dies (unless you are Microsoft).\nAnyway, it appears that a recent change (being able to use \"/\" where you would normally have to use \"\\\" in pathnames isn't compatible with the \"new style\" save dialog...I am stunned.. @Cooeeee said:\n\nI think this bug\n\nIs it a bug, or a feature (aka just the way it works)?. A pretty good suggestion--I'd recommend implementation without cluttering the Preferences with an option--just always do it.. Duplicate of #2987.  Please spend some time searching for existing issues before creating new ones.\n. Given the nature of how the plugin architecture is done in Notepad++, I don't know that it is a fair request to say \"N++ should always act gracefully when any bad plugin does bad things\".  I mean, you CAN say it, and WANT it as a feature request, but...\n\n...notes that I did not bother to save to a named file - you've spoiled me with that feature\n\nBad idea to use this workflow...if you care about your data...(my opinion only!). You ARE missing something.  :)\nHere's what I do:  edit .\\localization\\english_customizable.xml and put &amp; just before the desired character in the \"Find All In Current Document\" string (or change the string to something else entirely if you want--but the important part is to put the &amp; in.  Then, in Preferences -> General -> Localization, set it to English (customizable).. So I really don't know the history on this, but I presume at one time some but not all keys were given an \"alt\" shortcut in the Find family of tabs.  Then later when the ability to change the text and/or add \"alt\" key combinations at the \"user\" level came into existence (okay, you have to edit a file...), having the developers pick and maintain all of these (across many different languages) basically dropped to zero importance level.. @dinkumoil I think that @Hosen1989 wants more than one color available to indicate the results of a regular expression search.  The 1st - 5th styles you pointed out provide multiple colors, but the text that is colored would be constant with that feature.  The true \"Mark...\" feature gives the variable text functionality but only with red (default) coloring.  Imagine that feature, but opened up to multiple colors.  It would have been clarifying if @Hosen1989  had proposed how the coloring should be specified in a hacked-up Find/Mark window. . One of the limitations here is that each color/search would have to have its own Scintilla \"indicator\".  I think there are only 31 of these and some are already used by existing Notepad++ features.  Examples include: 31=mark, 29=smart-highlight, 28=incremental-search, 25=style#1, 24=style#2, 23=style#3, 22=style#4, 31=style#5, 26&27 are used for some tag-match functions.. This may help explain things:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/15758/some-characters-are-not-displayed-unicode/\nEspecially the part where Notepad.exe displays correctly and Notepad++ doesn't.. I doubt I am alone -- I have no clue what is being asked for here.  Probably no one responded to the \"community\" link from 2 months ago because nobody could understand it.  Sorry.  You can try to rephrase or elaborate.... So you think the best way to get attention in an already brimming issues archive is to open yet another issue?. Suggestion/workaround:  Try the BetterMultiSelection plugin.  Create a \"skinny column caret\" (zero-width column block) at the point where you want to break the lines.  Press \\<Enter>.  (Note that if your column block has greater-than-zero width, the \\<Enter> press will cause whatever text is highlighted to be deleted first before breaking the lines.)\nBTW, people tend to get offended (for some reason) when someone gives a workaround to a problem they pose here as an issue.  So I'm just saying that this suggestion in no way belittles your issue! :). @rafaelmembrives I believe I heard that if a newer Scintilla was integrated, some better column-selection handling would result...perhaps even this specific thing we are discussing would be improved.  Notepad++ 7.5.6 (current version as of this writing) uses a Scintilla editing component that is several years old...  :(. It would be great if things were \"prettier\" but historically changes aren't made to code only for this.  You're free to create a Pull Request if you'd like though...see if it gets accepted.  Please read and understand the Notepad++ coding standards.. Another \"view\" or another \"instance\"?. Got it!  Some people confuse the terms and use \"view\" when really talking about another \"instance\".  Thanks for clarifying.. And just because you have a 64-bit Windows, it doesn't mean you must (or even should) run 64-bit Notepad++ as you seem to think...32-bit N++ will run just fine (well, once you get past your current issue).. The \"zoom\" is controlled by the Scintilla editing component so there isn't much Notepad++ development can do to (reasonably) change it.  \nAs to displaying the zoom level in the status bar, you might see this: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/15679/seeing-the-zoom-level-with-pythonscript\nThat could be probably be adapted to display some sort of percentage but you'd have to figure out a reasonable algorithm for that.. Notepad++ has no native FTP functionality (it belongs to a plugin), so this is not the correct place to report a problem involving it.  Please close this issue.. The \\n is the first thing in your search string.  In the Find result panel, the line-ending is highlighted as (the start of) the match (and since the line-ending is part of the line it belongs to, you see lines 1 and 3 rather than 2 and 4.  The Find result panel does not show multiline results; it only shows the first line of such a result.  Note that there are other \"issues\" open (as feature requests) to allow mulitline matches to be shown as such.  But the way it stands now, for your scenario, Notepad++ is working properly.\nBTW, you can get the results you want by searching for this regular expression instead: (?<=\\r\\n)// if you use Windows line endings, or (?<=\\n)// if you use Unix line endings.  For some reason the more generic (?<=\\R)// doesn't seem to work in this case.. I can confirm this behavior.. This is almost certainly a Scintilla problem, and if so it can't be solved by Notepad++ developers.  It needs to be reported to the Scintilla bug list and solved in that project.  Since Notepad++'s Scintilla isn't anywhere close to the current version, perhaps a simple updating would resolve the issue.. @Piet-Kannitverstan \nI think it comes down to the N++ author has decided that updating Scintilla is not as important as other work.... What plugins do you have installed?  Do ? menu, choose Debug Info.  If I'm remembering correctly, this kind of issue always ends with a plugin causing it.. I would try removing the plugins one at a time and see if behavior changes.  Remove the plugins that do not come standard with Notepad++ first, as that is where you are likely to find the problem (if it is to be found that way).. @EgorAnatolievich At this point I would say leave the issue open.  One would think that with all these issues open it would get some attention.  :(. Probably would help to add some screenshots with indications of exactly what you think is ugly about this...ugly is pretty subjective.. Is this what you are talking about?  #4518 . It has been a while since I've used it, but maybe have a look at the LocationNavigate plugin?. As a workaround, did you know that you can edit your language file (e.g. english_customizable.xml) and add &amp; before the letter in the text of the command you want to be the accelerator?. Also, see #4531. Did you try backspacing first to remove the 1?  Or do you not get a caret in that box?. I can't even test your scenario; in 7.5.6 64-bit I get this:\n, possibly due to the length of your line (which is not all THAT long).\nIn an earlier version of Notepad++(which is my main usage) I cannot replicate what you are seeing--seems to work fine.. 1. Really, it makes sense where it is, especially because it changes the find-next button into 2 buttons (and back again).  If you hover over it, a tool tip describes what it does.  Exactly what is not \"attractive\" about it?\n\n\nHistorically, there used to be a 2-radio button box that controlled search direction.  I think I liked that better (and from your description I would guess that you would agree).  But I doubt we'll be evolving back to that.  However you can change the text of the checkbox to be anything you want for YOU (edit the appropriate language .xml file, e.g. english_customizable.xml).\n\n\nIt's not supposed to work like that.\n\n\nMissing accelerators for what exactly?  Add your own like I described for changing control text.. @koolraap Good luck in getting your suggestions realized.  :). @koolraap , maybe we're just a little more \"laid back\" in the Notepad++ world...and maybe we don't sweat the tiny stuff.  Again, wish you success in getting your voice heard.... @koolraap \n\n\n\nProvide some arguments Notepad++ approach is better.\n\nIt's all very subjective.  Truth be told, I thought creating a \"Backward direction\" checkbox (versus the previous 2-radio button [direction: \"up\" / \"down\"]) approach was not as good, but the author of Notepad++ liked it (apparently).\nThe upside is that the author gave us the ability to change the text on most controls (for multilanguage support mainly, but we can use it for changing what we don't like), so when I don't \"sweat the small stuff\" I mean I say \"meh\" to the \"backward direction\" thing, change the text if I don't like it, and mentally move on.  As I said, you're free to have your preference, you've created an issue around it...let's see what happens... . If Notepad++ were just like \"every Windows app ever\"...where would the innovation be?  :). FYI Notepad++ has dropped Windows XP compatibility officially.  Not sure how important your issue will be to developers given that; I would guess not very.. @JoachimHenze Good luck with getting your request implemented.. >Where did you get this official statement?\nDon Ho said it a while ago.\n\nAnd why XP platform toolset is still used if support is dropped?\nmaybe a remnant?\n. @dinkumoil Curious, what was the cause of the performance problem, and if interesting, what was the fix?  I looked at the changes but it was not clear to me.... Wow, a lot of effort you went to to put that issue in.  The Find/Replace window already implements \"alt+letter\" functionality, but maybe I misunderstand what you are talking about because you didn't say much.  Cheers.. Sorry I don't see a \"picture here attached\".  So I'll put my own picture here to show some Alt+letter keycombos in the Find window:\n\n\n. Some people would like to see this left alone...i.e., they exploit this existing \"feature\" in automation scripts to get the Find-result panel to be open automatically on startup of Notepad++.. Who's to say what is a \"side effect\"?  Behavior that exists that maybe isn't desired by ALL, but really does no harm and actually helps SOME...I would call that \"how it works\".  And I would say (although I have no influence) that it would be hard to find the motivation to alter existing behavior.  Is it really a big burden for the user to NOT execute a search operation (by pressing a button) if the Find-what box is empty?  I have used Notepad++ for a long time and I have either never started a search with an empty box, or if I have it has never annoyed me that absolutely nothing happens if I do.  YMMV and obviously does.  Good luck in the campaign to get it changed.  Cheers.. The actual technique would be something like this:\nFind what:  string1|string2|string3\nSearch mode: Regular expression. How about setting a favorite file with the Explorer plugin?. This isn't a place for questions like this.  Please CLOSE THIS ISSUE and try asking at https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/. Try changing the setting on the \"Use new style save dialog...\" checkbox in Preferences and see if it behaves differently.. @levimatheri YOU have the power to close this issue; I don't.. @levimatheri Oops, sorry, didn't read far enough back...\nIf @BernieStn agrees, he should close it.. Often when one is selecting text starting with the first character on a line, the goal is to select entire lines.  If this is your typical use case, try clicking and dragging on the actual line numbers (if you have them turned on...hopefully you do).  This suggestion might ease your pain somewhat.. One of the common things that makes me a bit crazy is that people often can't accept the way Notepad++ does things is because it does it differently than the way Visual Studio does it.  People don't consider that gee, maybe Notepad++ does it better...not saying this is true about your complaint, but there seems to be this attitude that there is a deficiency in \"whatever tool\" because it doesn't \"do it like VS\".\nI'm not a developer on Notepad++, mainly due to I see how contributors' changes are mostly ignored by the true dev team, but I'm sure they appreciate your praise, if they even read this.. Wow, I guess the color green is forever-more unusable in icons..... >...the icon for Notepad++, as a notepad software, should be white.\nMy Notepad.exe icon (Windows 7) is a preponderance of blue, not white.  I guess my \"mileage varies\".  Next I'll be called a dinosaur because I use Win7 (but of course I am using it in a corporate environment where I have no choice).\n\nAt least for me it is hard to mistake the taskbar icon for N++ for anything other than what it is...I mean, the darned thing has N++ right on it:\n\n. Duplicate of #2381 and perhaps others.  Also see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/15748/faq-desk-crash-caused-my-file-to-be-all-nulls\nLong-standing, known issue...sad.  The #1 thing a text editor absolutely has to do is to not corrupt and not lose data.. @nightshaddow13 , has this problem recurred for you?  We're looking for a reliable reproduction sandbox.. @prince2007g A very important detail you left out:  Which version of Notepad++ are you running?. I think the history on extended search mode is that it was kind of a hack to allow these types of searches before a full-blown regex search was implemented with Notepad++ 6.0.  I don't know that extended mode has been maintained much since then, but rather has merely been held onto for those used to using it.  I guess I'm suggesting that you try regular expression search mode for your needs; but don't take offense, you are surely free to report bugs against extended mode...I just don't know that anyone will care.. You could write a script (e.g. with Pythonscript or Luascript...) to do this kind of thing.. Well your request is so specific to you that writing code to do it is extremely likely your only option to ever have it happen.. Sounds rather like a Notepad++ \"session\" to me (see File -> Load/Save Session), but only you really know exactly what you have in mind.  If you are trying to push for something else, then best of luck to you.. Yea, sometimes it takes a bit of back-and-forth discussion to ferret out what someone is really asking for.  And then often it turns out to be something Notepad++ can already do, or close to it.  If existing functionality works good enough for you, please close this issue.  Cheers.. You can't complain about TextFX issues here, this is for Notepad++ issues only.  Please close this issue.. Please search for existing issues before creating duplicates... #4651 . Nice effort, probably no one cares... see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/250/it-s-time-for-ui-update. @talentlessguy You can make the changes and submit a pull request for them....see if it gets accepted. @talentlessguy what does this part mean?: \"Also unusable UI is the main problem\". Sure, but RIGHT NOW you could also do a quick transform of your data before printing:\nFind what: \\R\nReplace with: $0$0\nSearch mode: Regular expression\nWrap around: ticked\nand, if needed, a reverse transform:\nFind what: (\\R)+\nReplace with: $1\nSearch mode: Regular expression\nWrap around: ticked. I'm suspecting you have line Wrap turned on...if so there is no practical way with my method to insert extra vertical spacing inside a long line.  :-(. I've always wondered why it is called \"word wrap\"...I like to think of it as \"line wrap\". A long-standing problem for Pythonscript; hopefully the Notepad++ side can do what is necessary to allow it to be fixed.. Are you saying that Notepad++ is using a high amount of CPU cycles, from Windows Explorer in your case?  If so, can you put some data to that?. Dude, change it in the shortcut mapper...to Ctrl+F4...or whatever you like.. @jrheisey Sure, but if it isn't acted upon, don't let it ruin your life if you want it -- remap it via the Shortcut Mapper...I did.  :). Neither plugin-manager nor wakatime is part of Notepad++.  This issues list is for Notepad++ issues only.  Please find a different/better place to report this problem.  Please close this issue.. I see this bug but not as you've written it.  If you put between (the second) 4 and the 5 in your steps the following, then I see it as you describe:  \"paste what you've copied from the primary view into the primary view at another place\".  After this, right-clicking the selected block in the secondary/other view shows the Copy command disabled when it should be enabled.\nQuick workaround is to press shift+right then shift+left.. Why don't you try a 64-bit version and something newer than 6.6.8 ? It still won't be able to open HUGE files but probably will do better with LARGE files.  :)\nAlso, seems like you have some ideas about implementation....maybe take the source code and modify it and create a pull request implementing a HUGE file capability?. Another option is cloud:\n\n. The author of Notepad++ explains here https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/15981/notepad-7-5-7-release/32 (or close to that) with the post that starts \"OK, I guess I figur out your problem\".\n. @dinkumoil I don't use Javascript but this problem (19 vs. 58) feels ages old (based upon forum postings I recall...).  I wonder if now it is fixed once and for all...except for this type of upgrade thing.... Have you tried this setting (see below)?  It may change your mind about your issue, or perhaps make you modify it to consider the different possible setups users may employ.\nI'm unclear about your references to \"original proposed value\" and \"original value\".  How does this reconcile with your step 2 where you say \"without file name...\".  (I'm thinking that \"original value\" would be something like *.txt but since you said what you said in step 2 I am confused.)\n\n. I think it is better with the existing functionality.  You know immediately when you try to change something that the original file isn't going to be savable (say the file is beyond your control--it has to be named what it is, and it has to be in the folder it is in).  That way you don't think that your changes are going to be accepted, and spend time making edits, only to find you've wasted your efforts.\nI don't know if making one quick menu selection (the one you mentioned) qualifies as \"really annoying\".  But I suppose YMMV.\nMy opinions only...don't take offense...I'm not trying to lessen your feature request.\n[And BTW, you can script something to solve this \"problem\"...have your desired solution TODAY instead of having to wait for it to even be considered...]. I'd think you'd want the comments when doing this.... Yea...except the Hide Lines feature is not really usable in its current form (my opinion only).. These \"Run\" menu items of this sort are really just examples.  Edit at will to make them work for YOUR system.. >today i updated to latest version and bug is still there \n@cristian-sulea Dude, seriously? A fix was committed 8 days ago (as of this writing) but a release containing that commit hasn't happened yet.  Did you even check the date of the last release and compare it with 8 days ago? WTF.. This is NOT the \"Notepad++ installed via the store\"!\nUGH, see people, why the store fork should have been given a vastly different name!?\nPlease close this issue.. This is NOT the \"Notepad++ installed via the store\"!\nUGH, see people, why the store fork should have been given a vastly different name!?\nPlease close this issue.. Is there anything specifically related to a problem in Notepad++ with this?  If not please CLOSE and report this issue somewhere else (suggest DBGp issues list?...if there is one...). Go with the keyboard in this situation.  Hold down \"n\".  Each individual window that appears will get its own \"No\".  :). \"Undo\" once or twice.. If you open this ill-crafted file with Notepad++, the inconsistent line-endings will remain.  If you use the clipboard to copy its data from somewhere else (e.g. notepad.exe), Scintilla will intercept the paste and will convert all different line-endings to the current line ending type that Notepad++ is using for the current file (see the right side of the status bar).  Because it really doesn't know (and really can't know) what the user wants it to do with oddball line-endings, you get the conversion you see. The moral of the story is don't mix line-endings in your data...only bad things result from this.. The way it is handled now follows the default Scintilla model.  The easiest way for Notepad++ to handle editing behavior is to turn it over to Scintilla and let it do what it does.  This is not to say that more Notepad++ code could not be written to deal with the situation.  BTW, I tried this in SciTE (Scintilla's demo editor) and it is the same as in Notepad++ (which I totally expected).\nIt would probably be tough to decide on something to please everyone for the default paste action.  Sure, from your example you know what you would like, and that is to drop standalone CR...but does that please everyone all the time?  Tough call.\nAt least Scintilla's paste UNIFIES what could have been real line-endings in source text.  Much better than pasting mismatched line-endings that the user wouldn't know about unless visible line-endings are turned on--something I suspect few users do because they are \"visually heavy\".\nIt is sort of an interesting situation.  Where you say \"where they don't get what they see...is wrong\", that is interesting because to \"see\" something depends upon how one thing showed it to you; who's to say that whatever did the original displaying is correct? :)\nAnother interesting tidbit is that the original data is generated by some .NET thing, which means Micro$oft.  As crazy historically as the line-ending thing has been, you'd think that something from M$ would definitely not produce anything but CR+LF as line-endings--seems like that would be blasphemous.\nGood rousing discussion about this, though!  All opinions heard and appreciated.  Nice.. @mdell-seradex If it bothers you a lot, you could probably \"script\" something that would resolve it for you. . A script could read the clipboard for its data, filter that content as desired, and then insert (not paste) the filtered result into the editor buffer.  Perhaps it gets a bit complicated, but I think definitely doable.. What I use for scripting is the Pythonscript plugin.  This plugin's built-in clipboard handling is admittedly a bit weak (see my request for improvement here: https://github.com/bruderstein/PythonScript/issues/106).  Luckily, Python provides something called \"ctypes\" so one can call low-level clipboard routines (e.g. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getclipboarddata ) directly from Python.  An example of some Pythonscript code doing that may be found here:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/12525/replace-current-line-without-inserting-a-new-line/11\nSo basically via a script you could obtain the data in the clipboard (with its line-endings intact), put it in a Python string variable, do what you want with that variable (after maybe prompting the user for what THEY want to do when weird line-endings are encountered), and then insert modified (or unmodified) text (from that variable) into the Notepad++ doc at the current caret point.  In your case you might want to give the user 3 choices (add it \"as is\", drop the oddball line endings, or correct them before insertion...oh, yea, and maybe a 4th choice: cancel).\nIf you are interested in implementing this I can certainly provide answers to questions you might have during it...just let me know.  Probably not difficult; probably all the code to do it would fit on screen in a N++ window.\nQuite often issues remain open for a long time with no action.  I wouldn't read anything into that.  Sometimes issues are rejected, but often most just languish in the open state.. @ExDomino  It's in the file DSpellCheck.dll.  If you rename it to something that doesn't have a .dll extension, that'll disable it.  (I like to zip a plugin I don't want at the moment to a .zip file and then remove the original .dll file; I can always put it back by simply unzipping). @ExDomino said\n\nis that a request feature? I think so...\n\nWell, I guess you'd have to create a new issue and be explicit about the request, rather than leaving it buried in this chain where it will not be taken seriously.\nSome plugins have an Enable option but it is by no means a standard or required thing.  It seems you are talking about a disable/enable at the Notepad++ level anyway, not at the plugin level.\nPlugin Manager and the whole plugin subsystem is under rework currently (and has been for some time).  Probably a good time to get that feature request in, if you're inclined to.  I'm happy just to rename a DLL file (I don't consider it a big deal, although not everyone knows that that is what you can do).. The \"bruderstein\" plugin manager used to be \"sanctioned\" by N++.  Now that it isn't (scheduled to be replaced at some future date), pointing to it probably isn't going to happen.  Where exactly it SHOULD point is, I suppose, TBD.. @AtmaX , when you click the \"New Issue\" button, the form that opens is pre-populated with a template to be filled in.  I believe this is what @ClaudiaFrank means.. @neffmallon What is happening is that the regular expression engine is being overwhelmed and it coughs up an error but apparently Notepad++ is ignoring that error in an interesting way. See @ClaudiaFrank 's comments above.. Now Adobe \"Flash\" owns the letter \"F\"?  This reminds me of the discussion that the Notepad++ icon was too \"green\" and hence looked too much like an Excel green icon and should be changed.. FWIW, I like to think of \"Replace All\" without the Wrap around box ticked as \"Replace All in Current Direction\" but that all that text just wouldn't fit on the button.  :)\nRegardless, this issue needs to be CLOSED.. @donho said\n\nI don't see the relation between these 2 issues\n\nI would think that a \"Replace on a Large File\" could be considered similar to a LongRunningOperation....might take a long time to run...during which a backup kicks off...I think that could be the commonality?. Just a check:  You do know that there is a \"Close All\" on the \"File\" menu, right?  Same number of actions as if it were on a tab's right-click...  I think it is not on a tab's right-click because it isn't related to the current tab, while the other actions are.. It's also available as an assignable keycombination in shortcut mapper.....but people want what they want...  :-). Just a side note:  Personally I think Close All (and similar) this way are a bit dangerous as it is easy to \"stutter\" with the mouse and accidentally choose it when unintended.  If you have many dozens of tabs open (that you WANT to have open) and no saved session, there is no confirmation (for the ones that are saved)...your files get closed--boom.. The described behavior is how it was designed to work.. I think macros in Notepad++ are supposed to be very simple things (by design).  I often record searches or replacements as macros, and sometimes chain together several in one macro, but I don't write them when a subsequent action relies on an earlier one.  I agree with Claudia in that that's better suited to scripting.. @susantruong , @stepher1 maybe just reported the bug, probably cannot answer the types of questions you asked.  If you forked/cloned the code, you have the newest version (it isn't 7.5.8 or any named/numbered version, it is just the \"head\"revision).  This problem surfaced in version 7.5.6 so you could grab the source for 7.5.5 and 7.5.6 and compare them.  One way to do this is to get them via the download page (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download)--there's a link to download the source on a per-version basis.  I think there might be a clue to what changed for the function list in the change notes for 7.5.6:  \"Function List enhancement: Highlight the current function based on cursor position.\"  So, we see that some work was done in the function list area; it probably messed with the functionality that @stepher1  was used to and is complaining about in this bug report.. @susantruong So if I were you I wouldn't expect or sit around waiting for a response to that.  The way it works is, if you think that line of code is causing a problem, you change it in your local source code sandbox, and you test it to see (a) if the functionality in this current issue is restored, (b) if you break the intended functionality from the \"function list enhancement\" commit, and (c) that you don't break something else.  If all is good after extensive local testing, you submit it as a pull request...and then you wait to see if it is approved and put into the master branch for subsequent release in a future Notepad++ version.  And...if that one line of code isn't the problem, you go looking for some other cause of it.  Sound difficult?  Yep, software development IS hard.  :-). @stepher1 If you mean by \"distribution list\" the emails you receive from github when someone posts to this thread, then you'll have to turn off github emails globally (drastic) or click the \"mute this thread\" option in one of the emails (not quite sure if that works if you are the issue creator--like  you are--but it probably does).  But...I'd think you'd want to stay informed (rather than just try the functionality in the future N++ releases...and hoping...).  Since you put \"lowly user\" in quotes, I went back to see if I used that phrase about you, and I didn't (whew!).. @susantruong Wow...that effort didn't last long...  :-(. @stepher1 said:\n\nAhhh...such joy and hope...then gone in moments :( So very sad.....\n\nMeaning what, exactly??. In the 7.5.8 version of N++, I can replicate @tolkensak 's behavior if the \"Match whole word only\" option is unticked and there is no line-ending on the last \"222\" line.. Since keyboard shortcuts became configurable in Notepad++, there has been a lack of caring about what the defaults are...or aren't.  Close has a default keyboard shortcut of ctrl+w for apparently historical reasons, but you can easily assign a different one (maybe ctrl+f4) in the \"Shortcut Mapper\".. @nlsdg You CAN please everyone where keyboard shortcuts are concerned--you make it configurable--BOOM:  everyone pleased... (except those that just like to complain...everyone else adjusts the shortcut to what they like and moves on with their lives).. I think you can get your desired behavior (I don't use it that way so not 100% sure) by Settings->Preferences->Backup->Session snapshot...->TICK \"REMEMBER CURRENT SESSION...\" and TICK \"ENABLE SESSION SNAPSHOT...\". @slundahl2 Yea, I think there was an unannounced change in the default setting in a recent version that switched how this worked.  I actually think it is better to have the defaults be the way they are now.  Here's why:  Your description reminds me of many others (that eventually lose data) because they have only one copy of their \"important\" data.  You did hint that this data is not super-important to you, but perhaps it is more important than you think--consider losing all of it at once--would you miss it?  If so, I would advise always using named files (the TakeNotes plugin can make this super-easy) and back up those files regularly.  Just my 2c, do what you will...  :-). I concur with the \"possibly always\" part.  :-). Can you show what your settings are in Settings (menu) -> Preferences... -> Backup. Yes, with those settings you WILL get a .bak file in the same folder for every file you change and save with Notepad++.  Simplest solution is to select \"None\" instead (if you don't want ANY backups made).. @mzso Verbose will create many backups of each file you change and save; basically every time you save a new one will be created.  It will put them all in one directory and they will be named with a timestamp string directly in the filename.  It probably does nothing without setting a directory (not sure).. The philosophy seems to be that if you want really sophisticated searching, turn to another tool.  However, @jkathir , nothing stops you (or others with some interest) from working on this and submitting a pull request.. @prog20901 This really isn't a hand-holding forum for plugin installation.  @cmeriaux Is there any reason you didn't direct @prog20901 to just install this via plugin mgr?. Suggest seeing NppExec plugin...if that works for you please close this issue.. @jpanzgit \nEdit contextMenu.xml and put this line in it, at a reasonable place:\n<Item MenuEntryName = \"Search\" MenuItemName = \"Find...\" >\nRestart Notepad++ and like magic a Find... entry appears in your right-click context menu.\nIf this meets your need, please close this issue.. @wrincewind \nDuplicate of #2007, #2928, #4093, possibly and probably others...please try to see if an issue is open already before creating a new one...even the simplest search (e.g. \"garbage\") helped find the duplicates listed.. Without Alt in the keycombination, you are not selecting a rectangular block of text.  Unless your lines happen to all have the same length...so it appears rectangular, but it is not a true rectangular block.. Many people use and like this feature.  If you don't like it, why don't you just not use it?. Maybe this will be possible if Notepad++'s Scintilla is ever updated.  Meanwhile, if you try the \"Better Multiselection\" plugin, if you make a rectangular selection on a number of lines, then press END, you'll get a caret at the rightmost part of each line.. Is that good enough for now?...perhaps wait for N++ to update to a newer Scintilla...then reevaluate?  If so, maybe closing this issue is the best thing...?. It hits as you describe because the buffer it searches STARTS (when you Find-Next) at the caret position.  There is NOTHING to the left of the caret position (as far as the search is concerned).  Thus if there is a word character to the right of the caret position when you initiate a search you will get a hit, no matter what you can see to the left.  \nSo think about your insert caret between the \"w\" and the \"o\" in your example.  If you hit Find-Next here, it hits the \"o\" because there is NOTHING to the left of it (for searching purposes).\nI'm not trying to be judge-and-jury on this being correct/incorrect behavior, just providing the WHY for existing behavior.\nThere is more discussion about this type of behavior here:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16104/how-to-find-and-highlight-a-specific-occurance-of-a-symbol. Processing takes time.  There is nothing to \"fix\".. File -> Save As...\nOR\nFile -> Save A Copy As...\nIn the event that the \"new file\" you are talking about is a unsaved file such as \"new 2\", \"new 5\", etc., do the following keypresses with your file of origin active:  ctrl+a, ctrl+c, ctrl+n, ctrl+v.  If this need is frequent, record to macro and assign a keycombination to that.\nPlease close this issue.. @sharuzzaman Developers aren't going to spend time on something like this.  One reason that features like macros (and scripting plugins) exist is to ease the burden on developers for esoteric user needs that users would otherwise ask for as new features.. @sekkuar I think the originator's use of \"Clone\" might be leading you astray (unless I am confused).  Since \"clone\" already has a use in Notepad++ (the one you show), I think maybe @sharuzzaman could have used \"Duplicate\" as a better choice (although even that has a definition in Notepad++ -- but maybe one in a different enough context to keep the desired functionality clear).  [Whew!]. @sekkuar Well I think more accurately it would be double that number of keystrokes: ctrl+a, ctrl+c, ctrl+n, ctrl+v.  But...I pointed out that this could be recorded into a macro which could then be tied to exactly ONE keystroke.  Which would be equivalent to ONE menu command which developers could work hard to implement for the originator.  Which explains why this would never be implemented:  a bunch of work for zero gain...not to mention that the feature already exists as \"Save As\" or \"Save As Copy\" which is much more familiar and understandable than \"Clone\".. It is a pretty reasonable request.  I can think of a workaround as you wait for it to be accepted and implemented though:  Record and name two macros (\"Close1\" and \"Close2\"), each with a single action (\"Close\") and then assign each macro to a different keycombo (e.g. \"Close1\" to Ctrl+F4, \"Close2\" to Ctrl+w).. @jiri-h said \"...just one macro...\".  True enough! :-)\nWould you still like to see the base request of this issue happen?  If you no longer really care, please close this issue to help remove some of the \"clutter\" in the open-issues list.  :). That's not an \"issue\"...that's a question.  Why don't you just copy and paste that over to here and see if you get some responses:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/\nIf that suggestion is acceptable, please close this issue to help keep down the clutter.\nBTW, anybody that has done the programming that you've described above shouldn't have any trouble working on a real plugin, IMO.  :-). I don't use it, but the FTP plugin is not part of Notepad++, so I think a better place to report an issue would be on the issues list for the FTP plugin?. It surely seems like you are reporting a SherloExplorer plugin bug here.  The problem is, this issues list is for Notepad++ issues.  Try removing the plugin and see if your problems persist.  Report back here.  If the problems go away, suggest closing this issue and finding out where that specific plugin is supported and creating a bug report THERE.. What is your setting for Preferences -> Default Directory -> Use new style dialog...   ?. FWIW, if you uncheck that option, you get the behavior you desire, although at the expense of the other \"new style dialog\" features, I suppose.. @sekkuar I think what you are saying is, \"just type the darn extension yourself\".  And I fully agree with that.  :-). Option #3:  User saves the file with proper extension, then launches in browser.  :-)\n(That's the intended use-case for the \"launch in browser\" commands). So these commands are user-buildable.  The browser launch ones are provided with Notepad++ as examples of what you can do with the Run menu (for example, not everyone will have Chrome, but yet that command is there as an example, and isn't greyed out if one doesn't have Chrome).\nPerhaps if one uses $(FULL_CURRENT_PATH) etal. in the command definition, it could be a signal that the command should be greyed out when the file has NO path on disk...hmmm.... No clue as to what this could possibly mean...can you say more?...maybe a mocked up screenshot would help.... Possible duplicate of #4825 and probably others; please search open issues before creating new (better to add new or slightly different info to an open issue). @sekkuar \nIt works correctly as it is (that is, by its design...maybe not other peoples' ideas of \"correct\") and is not likely to be changed.  \nYou just have to adjust your thinking.  Think of the \"Replace All\" button as if it had the caption \"Replace All in Direction\".  Thus, it is impacted by the state of the \"Backward direction\" checkbox (operating from caret position in the specified direction until the end/beginning of file is encountered).\nTicking \"Wrap around\" overrides this directional behavior, but even it is kind of misnamed as ticking it causes the search to start at top of file and proceed until end of file, regardless of current caret position (a true replace-all...no \"wrapping\" occurs).  [Side note: \"Wrap around\" verbage does make perfect sense for an interactive search (\"Find Next\" button) or substitution (\"Replace\" button).]\nBTW you can customize the text that appears on the buttons to be \"better\" if you like--don't know if you knew that.\nPlease close this issue.. @sekkuar \nI think all software has some quirky things that only exposure to gets us used to.  :)  I'm trying to remember how this worked in my previous favorite editor...can't recall exactly but in my heart I believe it was very similar to this way for replace-all\nBTW, more often than not I want to replace something ONLY from the caret position downward to end-of-file.  So it is natural to me the way it works.  :)\nYou might want to try posting on the Community site first in the future about such things.  I know that you were probably 100% certain this was a bug when you opened THIS issue, but if you are at all questioning about something in the future...the Community site is definitely a Q&A type place.  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community. > I don't know if this is by design, or this is an incorrect behavior. \n\"by design\"...although maybe more like observed behavior after implementation.  :-)\n\"incorrect behavior\"...you be the judge (well, I guess you already were).  :-)\nTwo \"cures\": a) after doing a FACD, don't use the results after you modify the document; b) work with the results bottom-up, changing only text between the match and the previous match (that way all prior matches don't \"move\" on you).. FindNext / Find Previous only work if you haven't used another search term after the FACD was run.  I thought that the act of using (e.g. double-clicking) a result line from the Find result panel would cause FindNext / Prev 's remembered value to  be refreshed to THAT search term (the one that appears as xxx in 'Search \"xxx\" (# hits in 1 file)', but no.. So I'm fairly sure that this behavior is governed by Scintilla (the Scintilla demo app SciTE has the same behavior), and a quick search of the Scintilla configuration functions didn't show anything related to this.  \nBut I could be wrong on both counts.  :)\nIn the event I'm NOT wrong, you'd have to make this request of the Scintilla component (on THEIR issues/feature-request list), and then hope that Notepad++ updates the version of Scintilla that it is using (very infrequent) to pick up the change, and possibly have code changes of its own to implement for this.. This depends upon the setting for Preferences->Default Directory->Use new style dialog...\nI'm not sure why we can't have it all at the same time (e.g. \"new style\" and Unix style paths).  :-(. @andry81 This is controlled by Scintilla, not Notepad++.   Suggest filing an issue with the Scintilla project, but I believe this has been brought up before with Scintilla and denied.  Regardless, there isn't anything that Notepad++ can do about it.. @andry81 Did you search on the Scintilla tracker site for this type of request, either currently open or closed with refusal?  [I'm remembering now that it has been brought up before and denied (in a strong way) by the lead author of Scintilla.]. @andry81 If I had any, I certainly would have.  I just have my memory, which may be faulty.  :P. This is not an \"issue\".  This is a \"question\".  Please ask questions here:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community\nPlease close this.. Meh....  Files with read-only attribute set at the OS level deserve a special level of protection.  Notepad++ currently respects this level of protection.  IMO, existing behavior seems appropriate.. I did a quick test with the Run... menu and creating an entry like this seems to work:\ncmd.exe /c start $(FULL_CURRENT_PATH). @bbotz When I do File -> Open I get a window that opens that has a \"Favorites\" \"star\" on it.  This isn't a Notepad++ feature, but rather a Windows feature.  Perhaps that is of some use to you.  Otherwise, I also have some files that I use over and over--I just always keep them open in a tab.  :-). @dinkumoil I was going to suggest plugins, but the ones I could find that did the functionality I could not find 64-bit versions for.  As time goes on, it get harder to tell people they need to use the 32-bit version of Notepad++ in order to use old plugins.  :(. What is shown in the hover is the path to the file, so a clarification to Expected Behavior is The new path should be shown and Actual Behavior should be The old path is shown.  . @elvedin-hamzagic Nice observation...yes, I see same behavior.  Sure would be nice if it were consistent.. The \"Expected Behavior\" as per the above is what happens in 7.5.9 when one has Settings (menu) -> Preferences... -> Default Directory -> Use new style dialog... TICKED.\nWhen this checkbox is UNTICKED, then the \"Actual Behavior\" above is what occurs (although I'd add to the description so that it reads \"Dialog closes and all files matching the wildcard filespec are opened as tabs\").. Do you have \"Use new style dialog...\" ticked or unticked in the Preferences?  I ask because it definitely acts differently from what you describe above when that option is ticked.  Luckily, it acts as most people would desire.  I'm not sure how a \"new style\" dialog is supposed to work (in comparison to what, an \"old style\"?), but if someone tackles fixing this perhaps it only needs to be \"fixed\" for when \"old style\" is in effect.... @trejder If it is a bug in old style, shouldn't this stay open so it can be fixed?. @camusichc Suggestion: Don't make people write some \"dummy code\".  Include a concrete example here clearly illustrating the problem you see.. @LeonCheung This would have to be supported by Scintilla, there is nothing Notepad++ can do about it without Scintilla support.  So normally I would say move your request first to the Scintilla bug/feature list, but...IIRC a newer Scintilla version than Notepad++ currently uses (IIRC 3.5.6) DOES support a secondary vertical edge...just have to wait for Notepad++ to adopt a newer Scintilla.. If what @stanciuadrian says is true (no reason to doubt it), it sure seems like \"Available items\" would be better titled \"Shown items\"...and \"Disabled items\" would be better as \"Hidden items\".. At the risk of repeating myself, forget all this nonsense.  It has been defaulted to ctrl+w in Notepad++ for a long time, perhaps forever.  For those that don't like that fact, Shortcut Mapper gives you the ability to change it.  Utilize that feature.  Make it whatever you want...hint for the person that started this:  Make it ctrl+f4 (for you).. This is fraught with difficulty, and most of it comes from the setting:  \"Use new style dialog (without file extension feature and Unix style path capacity)\".... And shouldn't D:/*.log actually do something useful when \"Unix style path capacity\" is enabled?. > with a 12 core threadripper and ...\nPeople always think these things surely must make a difference, but if the code itself isn't written with them in mind, well.... It's my personal experience that file monitoring (tail) in Notepad++ doesn't work well right at the moment when you need it most, despite \"fixings\" to the code since the feature was introduced.  IMO it is one of those things that were better off NOT introducing into Notepad++ and leaving to other tools.  Notepad++ is an editor, and one typically doesn't edit files that one uses tail on, so why not have a separate tool for this function?  So I'm with @dinkumoil on this one.  I haven't tried TailSharp (I've been using glogg) but I will.  Of course this is not to say the feature couldn't be made to always work in Notepad++, and I'm in no way trying to belittle this bug report.. Your complaint is valid and should be addressed.  However I will suggest as a workaround: ticking the Use new style dialog... option in Preferences -> Default Directory.  If you do this Notepad++, will tell you your filename is invalid at save time.. Does this come from an \"issue\"?  If so, shouldn't the issue be linked here?. So in summary this is designed to speed up the case where there are a lot of consecutive lines that are bookmarked...\nAny reason why you didn't change the similar code in cutMarkedLines() in a similar way, or better, have a common section to do this?. Those are QUESTIONS, not ISSUES, and this forum is only for ISSUES.  Please find a different place for QUESTIONS (suggest: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/).  Please press the CLOSE button on this issue.. For clarity, you are referring to the \"Find All in All Opened Documents\" feature, not \"Find In All Documents\".  That and \"Full search\" (you used it twice) must be nomenclature specific to you.\nThey really should change the name on the button to \"Find All in All User-Named Tabs\"...but that's a bit unwieldy.  :-)\n. It's been noted...whether or not it gets addressed is TBD.  :-). > are you the author?\nNo.\nWhy did you close this???  I can reproduce it...it seems to be a valid complaint!  Reopen it.. FWIW, I cannot reproduce this with same version on Win7.  I get 'Save file \"new 7\" ?'.. How did you get \"underline\" in the Find what text box?  Try this: Close the Find window. Put your caret on \"underline\" in your editor tab.  Press ctrl+f.  \"underline\" should appear in the Find what box when the Find window opens.  Press \"Find all in current document\".  See if that works any differently.. What do you mean \"the tab bar is hard to see\"?  Do you have the setting for \"Reduce\" ticked?--if so, maybe try unticking.... Time has shown that this kind of thing happens with Notepad++.  The real solution is to name your files (and also have an independent backup method).  Should what you've described happen?--definitely not.  Sorry, man, that sucks if you lost data this way.. > seems like you need to upgrade to Windows 10 then\nThis is not a useful reply.. A much more frequent use-case is that you want the text that you have selected to appear in the Find-what zone when you hit ctrl+h.  Thus I down-vote this feature request...\nBTW, it already works like your request when the amount of selected text is above a certain amount (but I forget exactly what the threshold amount is!).. For me on Win7 with N++ v7.5.9 32-bit, as soon as I \"Move cursor up or down with cursor keys\", I get the expected behavior (\"Selection dropped when moving away vertically\")..  Your issue doesn't make much sense.  Can you re-explain, hopefully using complete sentences and appropriate punctuation (as well as good content!) so that you can be taken seriously?. So it still isn't very good, but I think you'd like to see an entry in that menu (and perhaps other similar menus) called \"Close all but locked\"?  What is your definition of \"locked\"?. So it probably wasn't the best idea to introduce a feature request for \"locked tabs\" by using the context of \"close all but (locked)\" but I think the meaning is clearer now--you'd like to see a feature by which individual tabs can be locked from closing.  Really, though, you could round out that feature description better and more fully to give it the best chance of being adopted and implemented.\nI'm not a developer on Notepad++, but sometimes I try to help sort out requests or add new information to issues.. @gurikbal , I have no clue what your last comment means, or how it relates to a \"locked tabs\" feature. I understand what you are saying, as I have used an editor that did that (can't remember its name) in the past.  I found it an OK feature, but not a killer feature (at least I don't recall ever thinking that while I used it).\nNotepad++ has a \"hide lines\" feature, but unfortunately I don't think it works very well.  And it isn't tied into search so that something like the filtering you mention could work.  But I think if \"hide lines\" was improved and actually tied into search, it could form the basis of the feature you are asking for.  My 2c.\nProbably what most people do, rather than something drastic like copy-to-excel-and-back (ouch, it does indeed sound painful), is to make do with the Find All in Current Document feature and the output of the Find result panel.  While it isn't edit-in-place for sure, it basically provides pointers to those local places.  (I'm sure you know about this feature, it just isn't quite to the level of what you want).\nSo bottom line is I think you have a good idea here and I'd like to see something like this myself.\nBTW, your \"not as...plugin\" comment made me think that you have a plugin in mind that already does this?. Not a bad idea.  If you don't want to wait for this to be considered, accepted, implemented, and released you could consider using the Pythonscript plugin with this short script:\nfor (filename, bufferID, index, view) in notepad.getFiles():\n    notepad.activateFile(filename)\n    if not editor.getModify(): notepad.close()\n\n. This really isn't a helpful issue.  Please close and follow the discussions (and/or participate) about the new way that plugins work on this site: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/. What do you mean by \"far more difficult\"?  If someone looks at this after time goes by, \"on the latest Notepad++\" is meaningless (state the specific version).. @abdulbadii So you write some short thing that confuses everyone and then you complain that they haven't read the question attentively.  Ugh.  With that kind of attitude you are lucky you get any kind of response and not just a simple closure of your ticket.  You still haven't followed directions and provided the Notepad++ version you are using.\nAre you saying in that some earlier version of Notepad++ that it was possible to toggle line #s on/off in a simpler way and now it is different?. > I can generate some files for example and check if problem persists in latest version of npp.\nI think this is a really good idea because IIRC a version newer than the one you stated has made improvements in the encoding auto-detect area.  (I'm not providing more specifics because it doesn't affect me...so I don't know more than that and I'm not inclined to look it up--you can do that.). IMO we don't need a bunch of issues logged while the brand-spanking-new Notepad++ plugin stuff is evolving.  Best course of action is to follow/participate in discussions about it on the Community site ( https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/ ).. Possibly related to #3353. @jannick0 \n\nsimply prepend (?\n\nBad form.  If I understand correctly what you are implying I think you want \\(?\n@PopeSpaceous \n\nI was looking into how vscode works, and I'm fairly certain they don't use just one regex to catch the url they have several.\n\nIf you like what vscode is doing, why not put the specifics of it here so others don't have to seek it out...then it could be used as a basis for possible inclusion into Notepad++ logic (or at least as a discussion basis).. @PopeSpaceous \n\nI know I use url's when I'm typing notes in npp and sometimes use punctuation after them which in turn gets picked up in the link creation.\n\nYES!

You may find this interesting:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/15507/feature-request-show-only-line-final-whitespace. I just reread all of that thread.  There was a lot discussed there (whew!).  I think the Pythonscript discussed there would meet your need (full disclosure: I authored it), but it would obviously require installing the PS plugin and setting things up (not sure if this is right for you and the \"n\" members of your organization).  BTW, PS is my favorite way of addressing things that never get done in core N++ (hint).\nAnother suggestion: Can't you set your version control software to refuse commits that don't meet your criterion (trailing ws in this case)?. >The Python script still adds noise by showing characters for all white-space (apart from leading indentation). \nI don't really understand this comment.  The script only emphasizes whitespace at end-of-line.\n\nIf it's subtle enough for that not to be really annoying, then it's probably too subtle to draw attention where it matters.\n\nI don't understand that either.  The highlighting is anything but subtle when I try it:\n\n. >These comments are based on the example from the other thread\nOh, well, then you'd have to pay attention to the relevant part of the other thread.  I was talking about the Pythonscript, and the \"I see it/Nothing to see here\" graphic was talking about something else.  This led to my confusion in your reply, but I understand now.\n\nnative support...\n\nSure, we all want this, for what is important to us.  But...how much action has this issue seen since its inception?  None.  How much is it likely to see?  Well, that can't be known, but...\nThe scripting languages available for Notepad++ give us the ability to correct (or make better) situations that annoy us and those that don't seem to be headed native.  I often tell people you can have what you desire TODAY thru scripting, or you can wait PERHAPS FOREVER for native support. :-)\n\nmess around with colours, rather than just toggling them on/off\n\nOne could add on/off control to the feature in the scripting.\nRereading the rest of your comments now, I'm still thinking you don't fully grasp the suggestion I made and continue to make, but I've said my piece and you will do with it what you will.  Cheers!. Sorry but you can't file bug reports against TextFX (or any non-bundled plugin) here.  This is is for core Notepad++ issues.  You need to find the TextFX issues list (good luck as that plugin is known to be no longer maintained).  PLEASE CLOSE THIS ISSUE.. @wgw It may have been bundled in the past if you are a long-time user...and you have it hanging around because upgrades don't remove existing plugins (well, with the OLD way of doing plugins...).  But still -- not valid to create an issue regarding it on this list.  No worries...no need to be \"sorry\".. It seems @donho goes back and forth about XP support...today it is out, tomorrow it is back in.  (IMO I'm great with it being OUT!)  :-)\n@HeinrichGit , unsupported means don't even try to run it, thus it can't crash, thus no \"strange attitude\".. @HeinrichGit I guess I don't understand.  An \"exploit\" into an unsupported OS -- no one will care when they hear the story, they will just say \"shouldn't have been using an unsupported OS\".  Enlighten me as to what is important for Notepad++ about this.. @HeinrichGit You are talking in riddles; I thought you might have some serious insight.  Never mind.. >Sometimes it's the \"little things\" that separate good work from the really great.\nYes, but we have to keep in mind that what one person thinks is \"great\", other people might think \"not so much\".  :-)\nYour feature request for dropping remains, but let's leave that as the SINGLE request for this issue (easier to work with that way if it is ever to be acted upon).  If you have other unrelated requests, open new issues.\n\nI noticed is the active area for the left 4 checkboxes extends nearly to the right edge of the \"Search Mode\" group box\n\nThe reason for this is that different languages may have words describing the characteristic that are of different length than the words in your language.  Also, these fields are customizable by the end-user to say anything you want; the space is there for that as well.  Not sure how difficult it would be for the code to detect the screen-size of the text currently active and then reduce the click-area to just that size...but again, this would be a separate/new issue from the current one.. It made no sense to close this; you had a perfectly valid feature request in the \"drop\" stuff.. Notepad++ gives you the capability to remap the key combos at the user level.  See Settings (menu) -> Shortcut Mapper...\nPLEASE CLOSE THIS ISSUE as a non-issue.. \"Customize Toolbar\" plugin will allow you to do this.  Unlikely to be changed in Notepad++ itself due to the existence of this plugin.  Probably best to CLOSE this issue.. >CustomizeToolbar plugin (v4.1) doesn't include such a button\nAh, yes, I remember some discussion about that somewhere...is there any reason a \"custom\" (sorry for the use of that word) button for SaveAs can't be made (by the end-user) in the CustomizeToolbar plugin?  I don't use that plugin, but I believe you can create custom buttons there at the user level.... If I'd have remembered about SaveAs and the Customize Toolbar plugin...I would have approached it differently with my comments.  At the time of writing I thought it was pretty much plug-and-play, with maybe a tad bit of customization (setting up a button).  I guess it isn't, which is a shame because here we have a dedicated plugin to do something (that is likely never to get attention in Notepad++ itself) and it is apparently working poorly.  :(  And if it were working, this discussion would likely be over.  :-)\nSure, this issue can stay open.  I don't see it getting mainline attention, but that's a different thing.\nIf it was working properly, however, I think (from observation) that the Notepad++ credo is \"hey that functionality is in a plugin, we never have to do that in the main code\".  And that works, as long as the plugin works and is maintained in perpetuity by its author.  But we've seen counter-examples (e.g. TextFX).  Ideally, yes, the best text editing features would best be mainlined.  Something like toolbar buttons is more debatable.  I'd rather see dev time spent on known bugs and text editing features.\n\n\"You miss a feature in Notepad++? Oh, there is the Python plugin, you can write a script to get the functionality you want, no need to integrate it in Notepad++ itself\".\n\nSurely there is a difference.  Scripting is one thing, but that takes it to a different level.  That is likening a (probably) one line configuration file entry to something like a many-dozens-plus lines of script code.  Well, one could even argue that both are \"coding\". :-)\nGood discussion; thanks. . > I guess this missing \"Mark: \" is actually an overlook.\nPut \"Mark: \" back in!  :-). @vlakoff I think what @chcg is saying with that labelling is that the current way it looks is workable but not ideal, so this issue is an \"optimization\" of that situation. :-). I think you are 100% correct, but I don't know that it belongs here as an issue! :-). If that's the attitude about it, why not get the damn thing officially in the store? Sheesh.. @Edditoria I don't like it because, as someone that used to provide Notepad++ support, which product am I supporting?  I have been doing software engineering (all sides of it, in a real sense) for 28 years...as soon as you change one bit of binary, you have a different product.  And it should have a different enough name so that people wanting support on this app store product don't come to the regular Notepad++ sites to get it.  @donho is okay with what has been done with this for the store (see above)...well, that's great, FOR HIM...because he isn't out there providing support for Notepad++ (the evidence for this is his pretty-much zero activity on the official Notepad++ support sites).. @Edditoria Discussions can continue on closed issues...no problem with that.  But I don't know that there really is any more to say.  :-). @jakevis Thanks for the offer.  As I don't do Notepad++ support any longer, it is someone else's problem; it no longer matters to me.. @tok3rat0r ...I bet that was a fun one to narrow down.  :-). Repro steps (one possible way to do it):\n\nWith one instance of Notepad++ running (with \"Enable Session Snapshot...\" ticked), be editing a named (not an unsaved) file\nRight click the file's tab and choose Open In New Instance.  Observe a 2nd instance of Notepad++ opens along with the correct file.\nGo to the 2nd instance's Preferences and see that \"Enable Session Snapshot...\" is unticked.\nClose first instance of Notepad++.\nClose only remaining instance of Notepad++.\nRestart Notepad++.\n\nEND RESULT: Go to Preferences and see that \"Enable Session Snapshot...\" is unticked.\n\nHowever, if you do it this way, you get a different (and to you, a more-desired) end result:\n\nWith one instance of Notepad++ running (with \"Enable Session Snapshot...\" ticked), be editing a named (not an unsaved) file\nRight click the file's tab and choose Open In New Instance.  Observe a 2nd instance of Notepad++ opens along with the correct file.\nGo to the 2nd instance's Preferences and see that \"Enable Session Snapshot...\" is unticked.\nClose second instance of Notepad++.\nClose only remaining instance of Notepad++.\nRestart Notepad++.\n\nEND RESULT: Go to Preferences and see that \"Enable Session Snapshot...\" is ticked.. My guess would be that it is intentionally disabled for the 2nd+ instances run.  The problem comes in when a 2nd+ instance is the LAST instance closed.  The settings from that instance get stored and are restored upon next run.  So I suppose it is a bug.  For myself I just stay away from multi-instances--I see no advantage to using it.  But that's just me.. If my hypothesis about it being intentionally disabled is correct (see above), then perhaps there won't ever be any progress.  :-). I'm confused.  I'm running the portable version, but I see no such menu entries:\n\n. Sure would be great if people would stop opening issues about \"design changes\".  Did anybody ever say the \"Plugin Manager\" would live forever?  And, if you are going to update, READ the release notes.. @Tony-Browne , you actually have to fill in the template before submitting an issue.. You found the template you just didn't fill it in.  :)\nYour second posting fills the need; this is already a known issue; I'm sure someone will know which existing issue it is and will link to it here as a duplicate (and then you can read about what action has already been taken on it).. Very nice description of the issue.  This blue text can at times also be colored green or red--do these cases appear acceptably when you see them, or are they a problem too?. @aev-mambro2 I'm not a developer on Notepad++, thus I have no control over what happens with this, but the solutions you describe might be prohibitive for a developer with limited time to implement.  \nThinking about it, it seems that red text color is currently used to indicate an error condition (text NOT found, invalid regular expression, perhaps some others) whereas green is used for success-but-informational conditions (where a match occurs after a wrap-around at an end of the file, perhaps others).\nSince blue seems to result in reporting a match count, perhaps this could be considered also success-but-informational condition, and could be converted over to showing in green.  Do you think that is an acceptable compromise?. What makes it moot?  I think it is valuable.  The way it works is:  issues are opened (by anyone), issues are discussed/debated (by anyone), issues (are possibly) implemented (by a developer).  If a developer picks it up to work on, they have the prior discussion logged here as a reference during implementation.  \nA developer can think, well, here's a nice-to-have solution that I maybe don't have time to do, but here's a couple of people that have agreed a lesser solution (perhaps as little of a change as one line of code) makes sense--I can do that one, get this issue closed, and make someone acceptably pleased.\nOf course, I don't know that is what would happen, but it seems a logical guess.\nMy observation is that Notepad++ developers seem to gravitate towards working on features that are important to themselves as users of Notepad++.  Since they seem to like the blue color (they implemented it, after all), and likely have no accessibility issues, how important would something like this be to them?  I'll let you consider that.  :-)\n. If you can't do better than that at describing your problem, you'd better just close this issue.. Is there some historical reason that people think that keycombos involving a \"FN\" key are supported in any way?  IMO if such a keycombo works when you try it with Notepad++ active (in either admin/non-admin mode), then that's great; if not, well, then.... @brandpeter , ah, that makes sense.  I think that addition definitely adds \"weight\" to the issue.  :-). NIHS?. What does \"not go with the others at all\" mean?  This is a ridiculous reason for rejection. @SinghRajenM , why would you ever bother to do another PR on Notepad++ code?  Expend your efforts elsewhere, where they might be appreciated.. One thing for sure, though:  BOSS is always BOSS !  :-). Please close as a non-issue.. Many many fonts will meet this need.  Enough said.  Let's not turn this into a font-suggestion forum. :-). For me your step 3 removes both \" and leaves nothing in the file.  It is likely you have a plugin interaction problem--try removing some/all and see if the problem remains, maybe?. I don't know if the developers would be interested in doing that, but it might be possible to script a solution with the Pythonscript plugin if that is of interest to you.. Can this be done? YES\nIs it on the radar? APPARENTLY NOT\nIs there something preventing it working? NOPE\n\nI see there are previous instances of folks asking about this (Issue #94 and #760 in particular). These appear to have been closed without any clear mention of a resolution to the problem.\n\nI suppose closure of these prior issues means that the developer chooses not to implement, so I'm not sure what good opening a new issue is.  :-). I agree but the Notepad++ developer does what he wants.. @glv1 Can you give an example of how this would \"help align columns of text quickly\".  I think I may know already, but maybe you have a different idea in mind..... It may be simpler to script a solution than to wait for Notepad++ to be given this feature natively.  :(. Record macros (5 of them) and assign to keystrokes (suggestion: the keystrokes should include \"1\" thru \"5\" in them to correspond to the 5 styles).  Problem solved.\nNote that assigning to the mouse is problematic; a lot of mouse clicking actions are already assigned to other behavior.. Why did you open this issue?; you clearly know about #1898 as you just commented on it.. I'm not super close to this one, but in #1898 dail seems to indicate that this is a Scintilla issue (that has been rejected for fixing) and not a Notepad++ issue.  Thus there really isn't anything that can be done, to my knowledge.  Maybe someone else will kick in with a different opinion, but really this discussion should be in #1898 and not here.. No problem, @MaxCorman -- if you would, will you CLOSE this one?. >Maybe offering a way to turn off certain underlines, or change them.\nFWIW, hackish way is to edit your language's xml file.  Example, in english_customizable.xml you will see this text: <Item id=\"41007\" name=\"Sav&amp;e All\"/>.  You can move the &amp; part to put the underline on a different character than the e, or simply remove it altogether.\nBut you are definitely correct, it makes no sense to have duplicates like the ones you pointed out.. @donho is the man will all of that power; I have none.  :-). I think you hit on the solution to this problem when you said 'the user has to click onto \"normal search\" first'.  :-). Sure, there are problems with these type of accelerators.  :-)  You can edit your language's xml file to reassign these to what you'd like.  Ideal? Nope. But it works.  But that is a different issue.. Some related discussion:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/16506/is-it-possible-to-run-notepad-from-cd. @mistrb01 Good luck with that!. I'm pretty sure the implied definition of \"reload\" means there is no undo.  Sure you can ask for it.... For the record, with exposure to additional information, I now like this feature request. :-). >Notepad++ discarded potentially valuable data in the Undo buffer without asking for user confirmation.\nThis is asking a bit much.... So you do an intentional act (delete all text) and you are staring at a blank buffer, and then you do another intentional act (close the tab) while you are looking at no data...and you still expect Notepad++ to bother you with a prompt at this point--seriously?  I guess you are serious or you wouldn't have typed ~500 words about it.  You certainly are free to ask for what you want in Notepad++ here...best wishes.. >And I don't understand why you apparently felt strongly enough to seemingly argue...\nThis is just an open area for people to express ideas and opinions (and of course additional information when it applies) about issues which may be under consideration for implementation.  That's it.  By \"arguing\" I brought out such additional information from you, which may be an \"oh, yea!\" tipping point (which takes it from a \"this is dumb\" reaction from a developer, to a \"gotta do\" reaction) if/when this is considered for implementation!  :-)  [And it is hard to type less than ~75 words in reply to anything worth replying to.]. @Davidebyzero \nI looked in Notepad++ 7.6 and I see a different default keymapping:\nSCI_WORDLEFT ctrl+left\nSCI_WORDRIGHT ctrl+right\nSCI_WORDLEFTEXTEND ctrl+shift+left\nSCI_WORDRIGHTENDEXTEND ctrl+shift+right\nThis is what seems to lead to the original inconsistent behavior.  I wonder if it is intended for some reason unknown to us at the moment?. I'm not understanding your complaint here, can you help clarify?  For me when I try it, the behavior follows the state of the Match Case checkbox.  If that is ticked when a Style command is invoked, only exact case matches are stylized.  If that is unticked when Style is run, then all any-case versions are stylized.  I believe this is how it is supposed to work and I see no inconsistency.. Oh...I think I see it now.  Programmatic control over the Match Case checkbox would solve your problem here.  :-). > Ok, great, let me know the outcome\nSo I don't know what this means.  If there is further activity on your issue, you will see it here.. @ebouden The issue may be solved for YOU via a workaround, but the actual issue still exists.

Note that they ALSO have special meaning in Find what, but that is more commonly understood.\nAs an example, see the regular expression replacement here:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/12887/switching-letters-with-one-regex\nAs you can see there, there are ( and ) used in the Replace with zone.  But these are the special meaning ones.  That regular expression replacement will turn the text news into swen ...and in swen there are no ( or ) so hopefully you can now see how this works.\nAnd BTW, if you use unescaped ( or ) wrongly in a replace expression, I believe they are just totally ignored (which may have led you to post this issue). :-). Probably should point out that this only happens (well, for me when I tried it) with Auto-Completion enabled with a 1 in the \"From _ th character\".  These are the default settings.\nI guess I'd say it's a bug, but is Tab supposed to do anything when the auto-complete dropdown box is open?  I can't say as I can't stand the Auto-Completion feature and have never left it enabled for any longer duration than is necessary to notice it is \"on\" and to go turn it \"off\".  :-).

First, I found that you are correct!\nSecond, I noticed that this macro is recorded like this:\n<Action type=\"0\" message=\"2621\" wParam=\"0\" lParam=\"0\" sParam=\"\" />\n<Action type=\"2\" message=\"0\" wParam=\"42015\" lParam=\"0\" sParam=\"\" />\n\nIf you manually edit the macro in shortcuts.xml, and remove the type=\"0\" line, then it appears to work correctly.  So...I guess you can work around it this way until it is fixed.  :)\n. >Does this mean it'll actually get fixed...?\nIt does NOT mean anything of that sort.  All you can do is log an issue here like you did and wait to see what happens.  Or if you have the skills, you can \"dig in\" and fix it yourself, and then present the code changes for inclusion into N++ master sources (doing that also results in a waiting game to see if/when those changes are approved).. Probably better visibility to ask this here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/. What type of \"script\" files are you talking about?\n. This is a question, not an issue; questions are better asked here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community. user with no admin rights is supposed to get UAC\n...but this is a question, not an issue, so look for answers (which probably already exist) or ask this question here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community. Why is a count of functions of use?  It seems like a real one-off need.. > It means that Notepad++ starts the new search from the end of already found pattern.\nYes, that's how it is supposed to work.. It's possible to undo, you just have to move to each document and execute Undo.  Not great, but not catastrophic either.. >did dev noticed this issue?\nDid you happen to notice that there are 2476 open issues?  It's really hard to \"notice\" a specific one within the context of that many.. I've seen other editors have this implemented, but to me it has always seemed superfluous.  For how rare the need is you simply ctrl+a, ctrl+c, ctrl+w, switch to File1, ctrl+v.  Note that I didn't include actions to open File2 because I was only listing extra actions needed over the proposed new command.. I would have thought that \"Yes/No\" is better than \"OK/Cancel\" to an \"Are you...?\" question.  Meh.. >v6.3.3 \nCan you try in a newer version and make any updates to the above based upon that experience?. This comes up occasionally; it goes back to Scintilla I think so there really is nothing Notepad++ can do about it.  One could debate what \"text editing\" really means: Are 64000 character lines in a file practically editable with a text-editor?. @OasisInDesert Usually people put up more resistance than that.  :). What version of N++ did this happen under?  Paste contents of ? menu's Debug Info... here.. So that just adds confusion.  Did the \"failure to backup on crash\" happen under 7.5.8 or 7.5.9?. Ok! This is good as a change in 7.5.9 was this one: \"Fix possible file corruption during backup or power loss or other abnormal N++ termination.\". You can do it with the NppExec plugin.  Personally, I use the Pythonscript plugin a lot so for a need such as yours I've exploited the Pythonscript console window (I just have to format the errors I produce such that they look like Python errors and then clicking on them opens the correct file and moves to the correct line).. @EAFSC Notepad++ doesn't want any format for this, as it doesn't do it.  :)  However, for the NppExec plugin approach mentioned above, the format is specifiable.  Have a look at the NppExec plugin docs.  Hopefully I am not off-base with this as I am not a heavy NppExec user. :). @EAFSC You would NOT have NppExec by default as it isn't part of the Notepad++ distribution.  The thing that manages Plugins is in a sad state these days; I'm staying out of that debacle, personally.  Sorry, because I know that doesn't help you.. @EAFSC That's funny.  After not having used NppExec for a LONG time, I saw it was still in my plugins list.  I went into it and in under 3 minutes I had it set up to do exactly what you seem to want (from your original statement above), although not with PHP because I don't work with that.  I set it up to run the Python linter. When it is done running it shows error lines in red (in the NppExec console) and if I double click those red lines it jumps me to the indicated line in the Python source code that got linted. . I meant \"that's strange\" rather than \"that's funny\" (the latter being an American turn of phrase which might be best avoided here).  Anyway, did you get something working?. Closing was an excellent decision.. Open File1. Open File2.  Right-click tab of File2 and choose \"Move to Other View\".  You are now side-by-side (or one-over-the-other).\n\ncompare option\n\nThere is a Compare plugin for this purpose, but it is not part of official Notepad++, so questions about it are best addressed elsewhere.. I dunno, I always thought when you are running under an OS that isn't exactly Windows, you are sorta on your own with these types of things.  Certainly a developer on Notepad++ isn't going to do anything about this.  Perhaps better might be posting here:  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/. @jasonbrown1965 Well, I don't know what to say. A developer might say, \"Retest this problem on machine with only a Notepad++ supported OS on it.  If problem exists there, continue this thread by stating that. Otherwise, close this issue.\". Possibly related to #5087 ?. There's a good reason for this. Plugins handling has radically changed.. >I checked the latest version of today. The problem is still NOT solved.\nYou probably didn't need to check the latest version.  If there was any action on this, there would have been follow up comments RIGHT HERE in this issue thread.. You are lucky you have only lost Notepad++ \"meta\" information.  Tons of people have lost all of their file contents as well. Typically when that happens their files are filled with NUL characters.. That NUL issue may be history now, supposed to be fixed in one of the later 7.5.x releases.. I can jump in and explain.  If you have an unnamed tab, e.g. \"new 2\", then it has no folder (it is unsaved). Thus \"open containing folder\" options make no sense and should be disabled/greyed.  Unless perhaps it is desired to be taken to the folder containing the \"scratch\" files Notepad++ uses for files of this type?. I'm guessing \"vertical split\" means having both views open (via Move/Clone to Other View) so that there is a splitter control between them.. It would be an easy fix but it isn't broken.\nWorks as intended.\nPlease close this issue.. There really is no explanation; it is just \"how it works\".  Maybe the best in terms of an explanation is that the user never sees zero as a line number or a column number.  [But definitely under the hood Notepad++ and Scintilla manipulate row/column data on a zero-indexed basis.]\nPerhaps the difficulty in interpretation happens because an \"insert\" mode caret appears between characters.\n. Do people feel better about this if they either (a) press the Ins key such that the caret turns into an underbar, or (b) change the caret to a \"Block\" in the settings?\n\ncounting characters is important\n\nWhy not \"select\" characters to count them? At that point the status bar will show how many are \"Sel\" ected.. [Okay, well that is a bit different than the \"counting of characters\" I thought you meant; so I retract my suggestion to \"select\" characters for your use case.]\nDid you even try my suggestions labelled \"(a)\" and \"(b)\" above?\nSo as a setup to what comes below I copy your NNNN.....GR string above to an empty Notepad++ tab window....\nIf press the \"Ins\" once and release it to put myself into OVR mode (see right hand side of Notepad++'s status bar), as opposed to it showing INS like it did before I pressed the Ins key...and then I navigate the (underbar) caret to be under the 0 in your 021 example, I see 33 as the column it is in.  Seems correct to me and even you have to like that.\nIf I then press and release the \"Ins\" key again (now I see INS on status bar), the caret (with a caret width setting = 3) now blinks BEFORE (aka to the left of) the 0 in 021 and the column indicator has not changed; still showing 33.  This also seems correct to me, as any new characters will get inserted BETWEEN existing characters, right where the caret is.  I'm perfectly happy with knowing that column 33 is to the RIGHT of my blinking caret.\nNow if I go into the Settings / Preferences and set my Caret Width to \"Block\", I am again still in column 33 but now my caret is blinking right squarely over the 0 in 021 -- again, even you can't argue with that.\nSo, in short, there is no bug here, and really no complaint.  You just have to understand how text editors work.  Every single text editor I've used over 35 years of code development (I \"might need some help from a code guru\"--really?) works this same way.  Even--and I hate to say it because I don't like citing it as an example of proper behavior--Microsoft Visual Studio's (ugh!) text editor works this same way (never shows a column zero).\nThus I repeat my original closing statement: Please close this issue.\n. This has been scripted as a possible solution.  See here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/11360/multi-selection-and-multi-edit. You probably shouldn't have closed this if you'd like to see it implemented natively in Notepad++.. I think you'd better be clearer on how you want it to work.  It is not that clear to me at least. . >It seems the %1 now needs wrapped in double quotes but didn't need this in prior versions.\nYes.  It is a design change.\nBut it really isn't an \"issue\".  Any objection to closing this?. @MaikaiLife I'm pretty sure it was a change in 7.5.9.. Sounds like some startup weirdness perhaps like the lonely #3640 that has never gotten fixed.. >I know \"0 matches\" is not proper string, it should be \"0 match\"\nWhy do you think this?  I think \"0 matches\" is totally correct.. @LordNyriox is correct.  \"1 match\", for all other N -> \"N matches\". This might be a six-of-one, half-a-dozen-of-the-other situation.  If it worked the way you desire, there would be others that favor current behavior (and that includes me).  I'd leave it alone.. Let's let the implementers decide on that, of course.  Meanwhile, have you considered scripting a solution? I don't know that you could assign as scripted solution to the triple-click, but you could certainly tie it to a keycombination of your choosing.. You remove them by clicking on the arrows that are placed in the margins by the hiding operation.  \nUnfortunately, when using the hidden lines feature you will not get very far into it before realizing how bad it is (IMO)--it needs work to be usable.. \nEven more evidence for the hide-lines feature being \"unfinished\":  Arrows are not visible in a dark theme?. Ugh. Save the file first.  Really, unsaved (e.g. \"new 4\") files are by design supposed to be really REALLY temporary.. You are free to call it a \"bug\" if you'd like.. That comes from a spell checker plugin.  Disable it?. It works OK for me to get your \"instead of\" result.  How EXACTLY are you doing what you are doing?. Sorry, makes no sense to me.  I can't help further.  Anyone else?. This will be of course NOT what you want to hear, but it is VERY-long-known that \\K in a regex in Notepad++ does not work correctly (in most cases) unless you use \"Replace All\".  Can it be fixed? Sure, pretty much all software problems can be fixed. The bigger question is Will it ever be fixed?. This isn't a place to report bugs in HexEditor. Please find where that plugin is supported and move your issue there. Please close this one. (This area is only for issues relating to what gets installed with a \"clean\" install of Notepad++, and HexEditor plugin is not part of that).. To my knowledge, Undo refers to textual changes only and not bookmarking (or other actions).  You are certainly free to complain about it not working well with bookmarking.. Still, it should be fixed, for the \"old style\" case. :). @DavidHansen-0x454d43 \nHopefully you meant \"Plugin Admin\" and not \"Plugin Manager\".. @DavidHansen-0x454d43 : @dave47 said he was using 7.6.4 so I'm thinking proper references for that version should be \"Admin\" and not \"Manager\".  That's all I meant.  And yes, about all @dave47 gave us WAS the version number--thus I'm surprised anyone (you) even commented on it. :). @DavidHansen-0x454d43 , I guess you're not going to get those details... :). You shouldn't have closed this unless/until you get a satisfactory answer on the Community site.  Sure, you should have asked there FIRST, but since you didn't know and opened an issue here, it could have stayed open.. Big big thumbs up...if if gets accepted/integrated.  Otherwise, meh. :). @LordNyriox I see \"for all the tabs\" in the image above; maybe the image was changed AFTER your comment?. IMO the best thing would be to drop \"the\" in both.. Why not take this a step further...when assigning a shortcut key, instead of choosing its base (e.g. S) and its modifiers (e.g. ctrl, alt) from a dropdown and 2 checkboxes (in the e.g)...why not just press a button (with caption \"Assign to key combo I'm about to press...\"--okay, that may be a tad longish) and THEN press your desired keycombo; have N++ detect what that was and assign it to the function currently being changed.. There's a plugin called \"Visual Studio Line Copy\" that will copy the current line if no selection is active when invoked.  You might want to try it, but I suspect that it will also carry along the line-ending characters. A script could definitely/easily be written to do what, though, if you have interest in that (it would have to be tied to a keycombo, though).. >The plugin is not even getting detected.\nDon't know what version of Notepad++ you have. Sadly, the way plugins work is currently having a major overhaul. I'm not interested in supporting that mess. If you ever get plugins working and would want to use the Pythonscript plugin, here's a short script for that which does what you want. You simply bind it to a keycombo and then when you invoke it, it copies the line the caret is currently on to the clipboard without any line-ending characters on the end.  Remove the # from the last line if you don't want the line copied to remain highlighted/selected.\nc = editor.getCurrentPos()\np = editor.positionFromLine(editor.lineFromPosition(c))\nl = editor.getCurLine().rstrip('\\r\\n')\neditor.setSelection(p, p + len(l))\neditor.copy()\n#editor.setSelection(c, c)\n\n. >pythonscript plugin will not work on 7.6.x\nI think it will, it just needs some futzing. Because I haven't joined the 7.6.x masses yet, I can't tell you how to make it work. :)\n\ndonho can implement this option directly\nalso raised an issue with Visual studio line copy developer \n\nSure, I understand.  But there are no guarantees and no timelines.  . Right, ctrl+c is the same ctrl+c as before.\nBinding a script to a keycombo is a 2-step procedure. First go to Configuration... in the Pythonscript plugin. Click on your script in the upper window and then press the Add button above \"Menu items\".  Second, In Notepad++'s Settings -> Shortcut Mapper window, on the Plugins tab you will find Pythonscript and your script listed there; you can bind any key you like to it with this user interface. (Maybe a restart of Notepad++ is needed between the steps).. @timikesmarky said:\n\nI'm too used to this.\n\nSo...sit around and wait for some indeterminate amount of time (or perhaps..and probably...forever) for your feature request to be adopted into Notepad++.  For myself, I would much rather adapt my workflow slightly and have a solution today.\n\nI also want to drag and drop the statements by clicking on the line number row without the new line. I drag and drop more than copying with shortcut.\n\nThat's interesting. But you are probably in the ~0.1% minority where such a thing is useful.  I can't think of a time where I would have found that useful. Probably a developer would also \"pass\" on such a request as non-useful.\n@MetaChuh , I would have likely gone for the macro solution myself if I could have found that community link.  I wasn't going to do it \"from scratch\" because I remember (or rather don't exactly remember) there is weirdness with the home/end keys in certain cases. Regardless, I don't think your solution is going to make the requester happy here because it adds the shift key to the ctrl+c combo and the requester has already shown that they aren't inclined to modify their workflow.. @pryrt , yea, it wasn't my intent to make the little script bigger and all-encompassing.  :). @andry81 I'm not sure that helped much! :). @andry81 How does SSD come into it? (confused).. @andry81 It seems a bold claim. I use SSD all the time without problems. Do you have weblinks that illustrate the prevalence of this SSD problem?. Why do you think there is more than 1 line in your file?. Perhaps this is interesting.  How do you propose this would work (i.e. maybe some examples where in one case show the \"unticked\" regex and then the \"ticked\" regex?). Ah, so it just seeks out the + and the * and changes all occurrences to +? and *? respectively (or the other way around).. Dude, chillax.  Become informed.  Read some stuff.  Notepad++ is undergoing major revisions in its plugin-handling structure.  Uninformed updates (gee, there's a new release--gotta do it) can result in extreme undesirable results.  All auto-updater behavior will be (presumably) restored when the upheaval's dust has settled. In the meantime find something more important to chew on. :). IMO Zoom is not important enough to waste valuable status bar space on. :).     notepad.exe 'C:/path with spaces/foo.txt'\nI can't reproduce your success with the above with 7.5.9.  With double-quotes it works fine, with single quotes I get this:\n\n. > i guess the success was only for the windows notepad.exe.\nHa. I totally missed that!  I thought the OP was somehow making N++ do it. :)  Why does everybody think that notepad.exe is the base spec for notepad++.exe ?. Why don't you look at your file in a hex editor (e.g. hxd)?  (Not Notepad++'s hex editor plugin)\nA hex editor won't lie to you.. ",
    "Rikk": "lol\nDo anyone else see no need for this kind of changes?\n. Imo, it is much more readable to have a counter named \"i\" than \"langArrayIdx\", for example:\nfor (int i = 0 ; i < nbMax ; ++i) langArray[i] = false;\nfor (int langArrayIdx = 0 ; langArrayIdx < nbMax ; ++langArrayIdx) langArray[langArrayIdx] = false;\n. In that case, another letter would be welcome -- not a int iHaveAfukingBigName.\nI dunno in C++, but in ES6 there would be a type let -- instead of var -- that would restrict the variable scope to the loop...\n. Free certificates are never in chain of trusted certs. To make Windows accept them and not flag as invalid everyone would need to install a intermediate certificate of its issuer. In the end, free certs are just like self-signed ones, useful for indicating the code was not modified, but not trusted by the OS.\nThe one from Certum (mentioned above) is not free and cost \u20ac14. Looks a great price, if yearly.\n. Afaik, the unsupported XP <= SP2 have problem with certificates using newer hash algorithms (SHA2+ instead of SHA1) as there are discussions the older is vulnerable and being rapidly replaced.\nImo, XP is well over it's expiration date.\nhttps://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2014/09/09/sha1-deprecation-what-you-need-to-know\nhttps://konklone.com/post/why-google-is-hurrying-the-web-to-kill-sha-1\n. Any other name for \"Lexicographic\"? I think many users don't know what a \"Lexicographic\" sort is, and in what it differs from the others. Which ones can sort only text or only numbers?\n. My idea is something like this:\n\n. > @Rikk IMO, it's quite complicated to use it.\nDo you mean complicated to code it? Or for the user to understand?\nWell, in my opinion it looks much cleaner and thus easier than a lot of (redundant) lines and words. Even more because \"Textually (lexicographically)\" looks clearer than just \"Lexicographically\".\nAlso, too long menus are not always friendly with screens that have small height -- a case of wide-screens or legacy monitors...\n. > a menu checkbox which only refers to something in its own menu\nI think to make my idea correct it should use radio buttons (meaning: you can select only one) in both lists:\n\nBtw, I really think Npp menus are a mess and need some rethink. Commands which many options such as this one might deserve dedicated configuration in a page of Settings.\nAlso, for those thinking my idea is hard to use... well, it is already hard to find many things inside all these big menus Npp have (... and with no icons).\n. @andreas-jonsson What is hard to understand? One is the sort direction: asc/desc. The other is the type of sort; all types support both asc/desc directions as I see from above posts, therefore I see no need to duplicate each type just for indicating the direction.\n\nAnd going into settings for sorting? No way! Talk about being hard to find.\n\nMaybe because Preferences window itself also deserves some restructuring?\n\n\"Sort\" which pops up a modal dialog\n\nI, personally would not like to press Esc or click a button to close a dialog every time I need to apply a Sort... DSpellCheck, eg., has a submenu item called Settings which open a nice dialog containing its own options.\nEdited\n. kind of... ooops\nThat's the embarrassing fatal error in my idea. The rest seems ok (need only one radio for asc/desc).\n. > It seems that this registry solution only allow open up to 15 files at once. I made some tests in Windows 7 and it cannot open 16 files (even when full pathname to files is short).\nThis is interesting, here in w8.1 that kind of context menu items also is not even displayed when 16+ files are selected.\nBtw, I use an registry code almost the same, with the \"%1\" but without the second \"%\".\nAnyway, imo, it is easy to drag-drop those many files directly into Npp window...\n. Also, /bin folder contains compiled DLLs/EXEs. I know projects usually don't hold compiled binaries, instead they use references to original repositories, so when you compile Npp you also compile sub-projects, thus creating these binaries.\n.

Why the need to explicitly set eol=crlf for some files?\nLocal repositories in Windows will have CRLF automatically, because core.autocrlf = true is default.\n*   text=auto normalizes eol, making it LF in remote.\n. My question is: why .bat, .sln, .vcxproj need eol=crlf on remote(github)? (maybe I was too implicit above)\n. > text\n\nThis attribute enables and controls end-of-line normalization. When a text file is normalized, its line endings are converted to LF in the repository. To control what line ending style is used in the working directory, use the eol attribute for a single file and the core.eol configuration variable for all text files.\nsource\n\nSuppose one's working directory uses LF, we need to force .bat, .sln, .vcxproj files into CRLF because:\nVC++ has problem with LF? or,\nGit does not detect it as text in * text=auto?\n. Imo only 3 had errors (mixed eol), see #508.\nOh why you reverted? * text=auto seemed a good thing :cry:\n.

It is a text editor and edit files as text, so one should only open text files with it...~~\nSorry, didn't read you were using 'Find in Files' of Npp\n. Do you also think it should not even try to search inside unsupported formats?\nMy suggestion for devs would be to limit \"Find in Files\" only to supported formats -- the ones in File Association options, or in Language menu. Or add an option named \"Exclude binary files\" -- it would need to detect binary files, however.\n. Imo, searching inside all files -- incl. binaries and unknown formats -- on disk is better being a task of external tools, eg. SearchMyFiles.\nOtherwise, Npp takes the risk of corrupting files, as revealed in this thread.\n. No, https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/ba5d36e2bfebc7325b6777ab2d0b54d7e49e2620 does not fix or hide this issue, I can still see it happen.\n.

Better install it portable, on a writable folder? You'll have all files together, which you can compress and extract in any other computer.\n. Yea, @milipili, that commit has no relation to this \"issue\" -- for which I also don't see a real point.\n. > preferences, shortcut mapper and style configurator\n\nYou currently need to copy just a few xml files: config.xml, shortcuts.xml, themes\\your style.xml.\nIt looks more organized keeping them separate; why merge them for split later?\n.

This \"fix\" is causing issues with translations: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/542#issuecomment-127525831\nImo, the problem for it disappearing is some failure in re-adding the menu items after then have been removed, maybe at this part of updateMenu() function: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/lastRecentFileList.cpp#L160-L164\nTherefore, imo, just setting a default value for it (TEXT(\"Restore Recent Closed File\")) instead of NULL, does not fix the root cause of the problem (previous paragraph).\n. Sorry, I have no clue how to fix. I'm still slowly learning about Npp very complex source-code.\nFurther I will go for now is a supposition that @donho forgot something when introduced \"Restore last closed file\" feature.\n.

The need for spending time with a complete code refactoring itself is the result of a failure in accepting smaller commits that would otherwise fix small problems as soon as they are spotted, and a failure in ensuring only code with good quality (well-formatted and well-thought) is published.\nIn the meantime, however, old code is fated to abandon, because the work is going mainly onto the reformatted version. Fixes to old code that are also good to the new one, logically should be picked selectively/manually; therefore, it doesn't matter whether it receives or not small reformats.\nFurthermore, for being essentially public, open-source software should allow broad, open participation in the code refactoring itself. When it starts, these questions ought to be answered: What is the branch containing the changes? What files are being worked on currently? What changes are being made?\n. True. I would merge your commits and much others if I could understand and review that kind of changes. Just ignoring errors, inefficiencies and similar makes no sense to me at all.\n. Is it about the reformat? Would accept only the line removal? I can remake the commit.\n. Made it a simple line remove in my fix-#357 branch.\n~~However, right now Git didn't update the pull commits, maybe because it is already closed...~~\nReopen will update this pull commits.\n. Considering that many times in that log Npp is trying to CreateFile in a /Dropbox folder inside user profile, I would have as hypothesis there is something not unicode-aware in this function: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/856924658bc939496f4670110ea61be26fa86a5d/PowerEditor/src/Parameters.cpp#L927 (or any other related to Dropbox support).\nAlso, from CreateFile function definition we have this:\n\nIn the ANSI version of this function, the name is limited to MAX_PATH characters. To extend this limit to 32,767 wide characters, call the Unicode version of the function and prepend \"\\?\\\" to the path.\n\nbut I dunno where CreateFile is called for Dropbox folder.\n. > SHGetSpecialFolderLocation - did I miss something (I'm away from home, on smartphone)? Where'd you get that?\nIt is used 5 times in Parameters.cpp, eg. L938\n. Btw, in my tests Dropbox app v3.6.8 does not even start on Windows user accounts with names using unicode (such as \"\u03c4\u03b5s\u03c4\")... Does @imbrish has it working somehow?\nBtw\u00b2, I'm not sure about the future of this bug's relation with Dropbox after https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/5e240147c51b6c27f1accbcfa191d9ddc4967e68 is included in next version. #399 seems a good catch.\n. Why removed _CRT_NON_CONFORMING_WCSTOK? I see you added it previously.\nI wasn't able to compile here without it.\n. gj thanks\n. Because usually only debug versions of programs distribute files used only for development purposes.\nProgrammers usually send debug versions to users that are having problems hard to reproduce.\n. > No vmware player. I want a windows on a VM on a server and i know there are some restrictions (for example only professional versions are allowed)\nWhy not use a VPS running Windows?\n. Also: [SHGetSpecialFolderLocation is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, use SHGetFolderLocation.]\n. You know you can remove it from shortcuts.xml, right?\n. Maybe a url like ? search terms could do it in default browser. Seems to work in IE/FF at least, not sure about Chrome.\n. Hey, this is an interesting thing.\nThis seems not related to Notepad++, not even a bug. I think it just helped you see an (almost-)invisible character.\nThe text you have (\u984c\u00ad\u672c) looks like is actually 3 chars, two chinese and, in the middle, one that can be invisible depending on the conversion done by programs.\nAny Windows text input field and any text editor, eg. LibreOffice, MS-Word/Excel, Notepad2, Internet Explorer, etc. will display it with the dash between chars.\nCuriously, in Opera (which uses Chrome/Blink), the dash '-' is there but is displayed hidden (you need to press left/right twice to pass through it).\nFirefox hides it better, it makes the cursor bolder when passing though these letters and don't display any signal of a hidden char in between, except that with a double-click it will select a single letter instead of the entire word (the two chars).\nLooking at these chars in Hexadecimal (binary), we can see the thing that in ascii is interpreted as '-' after the first character:\n\nFinally, the good text you are looking for is this: \u984c\u672c (just removed that bad char between).\n. I would like it too.\n. @donho What do you think about detecting Windows 10 in installer and don't install DSpellCheck only in this case? It is a great plugin, people surely is missing it in other Windows versions. Never had a crash caused by it (W7-8.1); the only issue I recall is the \"find in files\", which is long fixed.\nBtw, just as side note, another one, HexEditor, may be crashing in W10 too.\n. > Have no idea why it disappeared from installation.\nWell, unfortunately, it is due to the first post on this issue, simplifying: Donho received a machine-written notification direct from Microsoft complaining of 612 crashes on a pre-release Win 10 version, all related to the plugin. Error address is just this:\nAPPLICATION_HANG_BusyHang_cfffffff_DSpellCheck.dll ! Unknown\n. > It's completely up to PluginManager team to clear previously discriminated individual plugins.\nNo, it's all up to @donho to include updated and fixed version in installer. Npp is his personal toy.\nAnd people would better learn how to use portable compressed file for updating.\n. I'm not even looking at Npp code anymore. But I saw you just accepted my fix to border=0. Thanks, and other users will also say thanks. And yes, you treat it as your toy. #fact. End of history. Goodbye.\n. There is also a discussion on Community -- with proposed solutions -- about another case where C functions are not detected in Function List:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/170/function-list-doesn-t-detect-c-functions-that-have-function-pointers-in-the-argument-list\n. I think it is because langs.model.xml is more outdated than individual language auto-completion (API) files.\nI don't know why Notepad++ uses keywords from langs.model instead of auto-completion files for highlight... Whatever, people updating API files should remember to update langs.model too.\n(Not to mention auto-completion files are almost 3-4 years old -- except my few recent additions)\nI've added this to my fork langs.model branch.\n@milipili you don't need to pick it too early before next version, because I keep adding things there...\n. Myself I would opt for completeness in results instead of ideology based on unproved suppositions...\n. Interestingly, this also happens on notepad2 v4.2.25, notepad2-mod, but not on notepad2 v5.0.26-beta4 nor SciTE (original Scintilla editor).\n. Obs:\n- It regresses https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/e58ae03897aae88cb8c925b9b659581efb9e5b3d and https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/c6f206082e7a23b62d894b0ad8888c9e7c4b0c8a\n- Adds \"&\" for creating menu shortcuts, that doesn't exist in original\n- Adds some other custom commands\n. Have you studied the possibility of using mailto links so the system uses the default email program? I'm not sure if attachment will work properly for all programs; but, if attachment is not needed mailto seems a better option.\nEg:\n```\nmailto:?subject=$(FILE_NAME)&body=Attachment: $(FILE_NAME)&attachment=$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)\nmailto:?subject=$(FILE_NAME)&body=Attachment:%20$(FILE_NAME)&attachment=$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)\n``\n. 1. Now you removed a needed \"$\" in php line...\n2. I see no need to have two commands for the same thing, one specific to Tb (Send ... as email body textandSend ... as email body with Thunderbird) -- if one has Thunderbird set as default, this may be the only email client in his machine, else he doesn't have Tb.\n3. Should not quote the entiremailto` command. It uses URL syntax.\nThis is my suggestion:\n``` diff\n-        \"mailto:?&subject=$(NAME_PART)&body=$(CURRENT_WORD)\"\n-        thunderbird.exe -compose \"to=,subject=$(FILE_NAME),body=$(CURRENT_WORD)\"\n-        thunderbird.exe -compose \"to=,subject=$(FILE_NAME),body=Attachment: $(FILE_NAME),attachment=&aposfile:$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)&apos\"\n-        outlook /a \"$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)\"\n-        http://www.php.net/(CURRENT_WORD)\n\nmailto:?subject=$(FILE_NAME)&body=$(CURRENT_WORD)\nthunderbird.exe -compose \"subject=$(FILE_NAME),body=Attachment:%20$(FILE_NAME),attachment=&aposfile:$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)&apos\"\noutlook /a \"$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)\"\nhttp://php.net/$(CURRENT_WORD)\n```\n\nObs: I haven't test if thunderbird command is working.\n. I think this thing happens for all languages, also when using the \"block comment\"...\n. ~~Closes~~ Fixes https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/459\n. > For the next time please create several PR (or at least several commits) since it involves different kind of fixes (php, bash...) :)\nOkay... I made only one commit just because another time you asked me to do so...\n(comment to self: I think it was a bit more easy to keep adding things into just one commit than would be into two, as it is just one file to replace)\n. Are you sure it was being hold in use by N++? Couldn't it be some anti-virus? (these usually causes this kind of trouble)\n. What was the (unnecessary) job of flushCallerUserInput function?\nWhat's the relation of user input and context menu?\n. Thanks for clear explanation\n. This, #496 and maybe #495 you can solve with TextFX plugin.\n. Thanks\n. Why you need to copy just \"6.7.9.2\"?\n. > list of plug-ins (with version)\nand which ones are enabled/disabled. That would be nice.\n. It would be much harder task for Donho just to implement that than for anyone to just press a few keys. Not to say we have really big issues with the code in general, that are just being ignored or delayed forever.\n. So, I made a fix for this \"Issue\".\nI think it would be nice to add the Git commit hash to build info, so user know what is the exact source used to build it. I know Media Player Classic guys have a nice but complex script for doing that, but it's too hard for me to do at this moment.\n. :astonished:\n. Now donho pretends he's not reading our comments. Why is it so hard to give an answer?\n. Yes, #691 was meant as a simple workaround until that happens.\n\"If you have some problem in your life and need to deal with it, then use religion, that's fine. I use Google.\"\n[Social] \"Life is what happens to you while you're looking at your smartphone.\"\nReally, you need more people in charge of accepting or denying commits. It's ok to have a life, but it's not ok to monopoly the development of open-source program.\n. Was just quoting Npp deeply embedded wisdom.\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/543 Good for kids.\n. From Donho's catacombs: http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/Searching_And_Replacing#Find_in_files_specific_features\n. It writes a line like this in config.xml file. Make sure Np++ has write access to that file.\nxml\n<GUIConfig name=\"AppPosition\" x=\"151\" y=\"152\" width=\"1064\" height=\"666\" isMaximized=\"yes\" />\n. If that was the issue, could you please close the Issue?\n. > I can close this now, but Notepad++ should give an error message if it cannot write out its settings?\nYes, I tested it running from a folder it could not write to, and received these 2 dialogs: (after that Npp opened itself but with a strange appearance (wrong toolbar icons, strange menus, default theme etc.)\n (Sim = Yes)\n\nIs \"Compare.ini\" from some plugin you have installed? (because it is not a default file...)\n. Don, thanks for clarifying this.\nBut... is that comparison done manually or by a script? If manually, I don't see why to keep that file on repository, because it is always downloaded by people cloning the repo. On a second thought, maybe adding it to .gitignore could solve that...\n. Seems to work here... does it happens only in one file?\nBtw, if not using regex in search but only new line symbols, I think using Extended mode should be a bit faster.\n. So this is a rework fixing https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/511, ya? If so, then @milipili could close it.\n. Looks like @donho ~~forced it to appear~~ defined the initial value in english\u00b9, I think the problem is that it is not updated with translation after Npp initialization.\n\u00b9https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/a958b019ffdf637915598a54fd85f0da5379ebda#diff-35d82bdf4e1fdc62d667eb514cbc8cd2R87\n. Good idea. Although poor tasted ones, like the ones I removed, are not recommended for public releases, for programs that intend to be serious, and as widespread\u00b9 as Npp.\nUnless you are waiting more negative news on media.\n\u00b9 The opinion of half-dozen may (and probably will) not be the same of millions of users around the world.\n. Maybe it's good to clarify my opinion about the jokes in general: I'm not against the absolute majority, some are very good indeed! Only a few need to ~~take shower~~ burn.\n. What if someone saves \"new 0.txt\", closes it, he will start another \"new 0\" one? He would need to rename it on save...\nThis is an undesirable change, imo.\n. Maybe the fix here should be a single variable change, so it always start in \"new 1\" instead of \"new 0\". This looks a traditional behavior in many programs, eg. Photoshop starts with \"Untitled-1\".\nBuffer.cpp line 1109\ndiff\n-   wsprintf(nb, TEXT(\"%d\"), 0);\n+   wsprintf(nb, TEXT(\"%d\"), 1);\n(Not sure if this one also needs change in this case: _pscratchTilla->execute(SCI_ADDREFDOCUMENT, 0, doc);)\n. Most of these you mentioned are already on 6.8 -- you need to update your langs.xml using langs.model.xml manually, because Npp doesn't do it automatically (you can delete/rename langs.xml so it is recreated from langs.model.xml).\nI've been adding PHP keywords lately... (eg. #488) (cooking more at my fork).\nWill add the ones you mentioned and are missing... PHP has so many (thousands) functions, consts etc. that is easy to miss a lot of them.\nBtw, curiously array_sort is not on the list of Array Functions, I think it may be an alias of sort (you could use that meanwhile). There's also a nice list of functions for array sorting.\n. Thanks for pointing it, will take a look; although it probably doesn't include constants (that are also added to the list).\n. tomorrow will review, test more php versions(nix/win) and create a pr.\nmany thanks\n. Ok, almost done with this [never-ending1] job. For now, some conclusion:\nMany functions/constants comes from php extensions, but whether they are or are not enabled is something that greatly vary from server to server... With that, we can better find more new keywords using php website lists, for two extra reasons: it lists both keywords of latest and deprecated versions, and we don't need to mess around with server configs enabling extensions (and having every one enabled is almost impossible).\n1Even being possible to add more keywords, the new list grew almost 60% (in bytes).\n. @Jukino I will not create a PR for Npp yet, because I plan to add more keywords soon (before next release), but you can get the updated file from here:\nhttps://github.com/Rikk/notepad-plus-plus/blob/langs.model/PowerEditor/src/langs.model.xml\n(Download Raw version)\n. Not even Explorer goes well with just Font Size changes. People should go with changing DPI.\n. Sure, it is another thing that can be improved, but nevertheless user must be aware some visual glitches happens here and there. Anyway, I feel it must not be hard to fix (for those familiar with UI things).\n. > It would be appreciated if the toolbar would be customizable, that is, reordering the icons and removing/readding icons would be possible.\n+1\nEven the tasteless Notepad2 has this feature.\n. Hey, for those who don't know yet, there is a plugin called \"Customize Toolbar\" that does indeed add the dialog we are looking for.\nIt doesn't, however, add a context menu.\n. @donho What should be the fix? Where to change? To accomplish this: Initial file name should be \"new 1\" instead of \"new 0\".\nDoes using nextUntitledNewNumber() will do it? (as noted as \"alternative fix\").\n. Sure, If Npp was started with a document, next \"new X\" should be \"new 1\", that's correct.\nI can fix the PR -- you need to reopen it -- but I don't know what to change to fix.\n(I still doesn't have VStudio installed so I can't test this kind of fixes myself, was doing this pr based on logic)\n. Git allows update of PR, without need to create a new one. Looks magic, but may be called \"synchronization\".\n. Hey, but what should be the change?\nwsprintf(nb, TEXT(\" %d\"), nextUntitledNewNumber());  ?\n. If you prefer, you may keep this closed, so you can do your own commit, Don. No need to credit me for this.\n. Doesn't the nextUntitledNewNumber() method account for that? If Npp started with a document, there should not be any usedNumbers, then newNumber will be 1 (size_t newNumber = 1).\nEdit:\nIs bufferFromDocument method called only when Npp starts without a document? Or always?\nI see it is called in ScintillaEditView.cpp at attachDefaultDoc() method with its second param (dontIncrease) false:\ncpp\nBufferID id = MainFileManager->bufferFromDocument(doc, false, true);//true, true);  //keep counter on 1\nMaybe should be true as noted in comments, so it doesn't bump to 'new 2'?\nBut if bufferFromDocument is called only when Npp starts without a document, why would it get increased?\nHeck what a confusing thing.\n. :poop:\nHave you even read my questions?\n:scream_cat:\n\n(I still doesn't have VStudio installed so I can't test this kind of fixes myself, was doing this pr based on logic)\n. @MarkMaldaba Do you have ease to compile Npp? If so, could you please tell me what happens with this https://github.com/Rikk/notepad-plus-plus/commit/3c9527401d8beeda98dcd93767711c99268b4158 ?\nDonho says https://github.com/Rikk/notepad-plus-plus/commit/afadd5cb5352cc79a0310328c3a0c16a65add42f introduces \"new 2\" issue. If using the nextUntitledNewNumber() function gives the same problem, then it is the bugged thing. Btw, my fix is inside bufferFromDocument function that ideally should be called only when Npp starts without a document; therefore, it shouldn't increase number to \"new 2\" as I inquired above.\n. > I'm preparing a new release so I have no time\n\nLike if there is none very important issues raised everywhere. :imp:\nNo hurry to read issues, comments etc., but to release versions....\nHere we get another placebo release.\n. It is shortcut for \"Restore Recent Closed File\", wouldn't it be better that plugin change its shortcut? Or you can assign another one...\n. Duplicate https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/370\n. I understand... but for Npp as default I think it is perfect for restoring tabs, because it is same shortcut browsers use; in this case, I think it's better either the plugin be updated (dunno who is the author), or in the meanwhile you can change the keys for restoring tabs so the plugin works, eg:\n\n. No, a common behavior in many programs is to ask to remove from list, when the user click on a file that doesn't exist on disk. Another common behavior is to display a message like \"Cannot open the selected item because the file could not be found\" with an OK button; clicking Ok will automatically remove file from list.\n. > then click on one of the matches that appear in the \"Find result\" panel, it will regenerate the function list each time\nI see it too, with small files it just blinks Function List panel, what means a refresh(reload) was triggered. In bigger files the reload takes more time, and only after that the line is selected.\n~~Seems the same speed since \"reload\" of Function List was implemented in v6.5 (2013-09-29).~~\nEdit 07/29 - Errata: looks like only the button was added at that moment, FunctionListPanel::reload() looks older.\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/WinControls/FunctionList/functionListPanel.cpp#L206\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/WinControls/FunctionList/functionListPanel.cpp#L422\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/WinControls/FunctionList/functionListPanel.cpp#L666\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/Notepad_plus.cpp#L4740\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/Notepad_plus.cpp#L5375\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/NppIO.cpp#L483\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/NppIO.cpp#L1559\n. Yea, make it faster should be great... But why it needs to reload when double click entry in 'find result'? File is not being changed, thus no change in functions.\n. Imo, you are wrong. It is default behavior even in MS Word since stone age.\nIf you want only the content of the line (without EOF characters), go to the desired line, press Home once, and then Shift+End. Btw, it doesn't work in Word, where it does the same as selecting entire line with click on left margin.\nWhat editor happens to do like you said?\n. @aaaxx\nWhat about people using vi/vim? Yea, stone age. Operating systems relying exclusively on command lines? Yea, stone age.\nI say thanks for Microsoft trying to spread visual computing.\n(even though they started doing some sh*t after Windows 7)\n. @mfitzen \nPSPad looks a good editor, and its line selection behavior is interesting, but what advantage you see in not selecting EOL automatically vs. selecting? (in other words, what can be an use case?)\n. > And it sucks always to delete blank lines after pasting the content.\nWhy it happens for you? Doesn't happen with me:\n\n. Yes, this should happen, but in your case, the correct way is placing the cursor at start of line 3 and paste, this way you don't even need to manually press enter. I think this kind of thing is more a matter of practice.\nUsed Photoshop for the gif.\n. Ok, let's wait to see what devs think, then...\n@donho\n@milipili\n. These &amp; are used to create menu shortcuts using keyboard letters. Os quais s\u00e3o usados quando navega no menu usando ALT.\n. I think he broke all keyboard shortcuts (Alt key). I would not commit.\n. Looks good.\nEst\u00e1 OK.\n. @donho I see buf->isDirty() is used 4 times in that file, wouldn't it be better to create a global variable instead? (can promote the one at line 456)\n. As @donho didn't merge PR itself, I'm asking here to close this Issue, cause it's already fixed in https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/9b4e8888b0a7741c0dbba975dc4a58a8c4ca2cc5\n. I think @donho uses https://notepad-plus-plus.org/update/getDownloadUrl.php for auto-update.\nImo, your suggestion is more nice.\n. Hard to place cursor at beginning?\nAlso, since there is \"Wrap around\", why need to start from top?\n. Also you can go to top using Ctrl+G, type 1, press Enter.\n. Are you using non-default DPI (not 96dpi)?\n. I can confirm with Windows 7 Classic Theme (not with the Basic which looks the same as Aero)...\nOne workaround for you (keeping performance), is to disable Themes Service while you are using Aero or Basic, it will revert to a theme something between Classic and Basic.\n. I can reproduce everywhere, it has a window border remaining in all sides, which is created by WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE which is an extended style of windows.\nAnd it is by definition:\n\nWS_EX_CLIENTEDGE\n0x00000200L\nThe window has a border with a sunken edge.\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff700543%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\n. Uploaded sample image to pull request.\nBtw, this is border width option:\n\n. Reworded initial post to make this long-standing problem clearer. No excuses not to acknowledge the obvious existence of this.\n. > Already planned :)\n@milipili how will the interface be rendered? What I see programs1 doing and I think allows powerful customization is using an engine capable of rendering HTML/XML, Firefox uses its own XUL, for example.\n1 and now these \"modern apps\" from Microsoft.\n. Man, you read this already, feel free to push a commit.\n. @Yaron10 \nThe work Franco and you done is excellent!\nI see you got improved icons, improving Franco's work, they look great!\nMay I give a suggestion? Yes! So, here it is:\nMake a copy of the 3 icons related to Recent Files, in a subfolder called \"Recent Files\", because that feature can also be displayed in a submenu.\nLanguage menu needs subfolders too, as it has the option to be Compact.\nAs of newest version, rename:\nSort Lines in Ascending Order -> Sort Lines Lexicographically Ascending\nSort Lines in Descending Order -> Sort Lines Lexicographically Descending\nI've made an updated package merging Yaron icons over Franco's package with the above changes.\n. That we can send binary files and github thinks they are images... hope they don't fix it. :scream:\nYou need Save As to download that broken image that's not an image...\n. @milipili you can install MenuIcons plugin to see it in action, ya?\n. MenuIcons is making Npp crash very often on exit. It needs to be fixed.\n. Thanks, fixed the .pbd (was a copy-paste typo).\nAbout Debug thing, really I don't know what is being included, in reality my binary sized increased by aprox. 1kb when I disabled it (sic) -- more logically size should have decreased. Clarify: this is comparing Release Win32 builds, not Debug ones.\n. I guess it's better just post Issues after Pulls, because who cares at all? It is not possible to discuss contributions to Notepad++ project.\nNone of the devs do commits to their own repositories before publishing to main project, instead just pushes bugs and flaws.\nGoodbye this issue.\n. Thanks for at least one line of feedback.\nAnyway I'm thinking/testing more proposals.\nAnd finding a way to fix building Scilexer for x64 and with boost in vc++14.\n. oh I forgot to edit... I mean with the one from nuget.\nBtw, do you know if only the .lib file from boost_regex is needed, or we need also the boost package?\n. This is not related to Npp, but a problem with your spell check plugin (DSpellCheck?) or maybe with the dictionary you use for your language.\nBetter you report it to them?\n. You could try a post here:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/category/5/plugin-development\n. @milipili Could you please ask Donho to add a note somewhere saying that people need to update langs.xml manually?\n. Drag-drop often fails when one of the two programs is running with elevated privileges (ie. as admin) and the other normal privs.\n. Yes\n. #666 - This is Donho's favorite issue.\n. As wished.\n:japanese_ogre: :japanese_goblin: :smiling_imp: :feelsgood:\n. As I edited above, it seems main problem is with Word Wrap, even if no line is actually wrapping in the test file.\nI'll be profiling it later, as well suggested, thanks ariccio.\n. Was so curious to see what was that, so I have this:\nWith \"Word Wrap\" on:\n\nThe \"cpu\" hungry appointed one is \"[external code]\", but previous function is the ScintillaEditView::scintillaNew_Proc:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/ScitillaComponent/ScintillaEditView.cpp#L298\nMakes sense for you guys familiarized with the code?\n@ariccio how we can find the problem? Is that the culprit function?\n\"Word Wrap\" off (I see no real problem):\n\n. Sorry, don't have it installed. (I don't intend to install it either (that is truly a time-consuming task lol)).\nEdit: the behavior (delay with cpu usage) can be observed with release build (file I posted in initial post), no need to use visual studio; dunno if vs2013 would point to same function.\n. One thing (off-topic) you could look with a x86 build is this I posted in community:\nIf I have no plugins enabled and no other file opened, I can open files with maximum size around 362MB, before it displays \u201cFile is too big to be opened\u201d error.\nBut with my plugins enabled, the limit lowers to about 150MB.\n\nBoth cases are much lower than the limit of RAM a 32-bit program can allocate (~2.5-3GB).\nBtw, the x64 build I made used around 2GB (with a pike of 3GB) to open let's say a 900MB file.\n. Okay, looks like it's up to Scintilla PositionCache::MeasureWidths :arrow_right: SurfaceGDI::MeasureWidths :arrow_right: gdi32.dll :arrow_right: ???\nThis round I tested Release x86 with <GenerateDebugInformation>true</GenerateDebugInformation> (yea, ariccio, it is useful for something :smile:)\nCan these .vsps (analyzed reports?) files be viewed in a machine other than the one that created them? If so, I share mine here.\n. Nowadays, shouldn't it use DirectWrite to render? Afaik, gdi32 is a thing from win 9x era.\n. Exactly, now your turn to find the wrong code there xD\n(For me wrong is the \"Windows 9x\" in comments lol)\n. Then maybe we should make a ~~pull~~patch for scintilla if this improves our slowness -- or keep it for our mod, if it breaks any compat they may want to have with 9x cr*p.\n. After above comment I saw Scintilla has an alternative class SurfaceD2D for these commands, instead of SurfaceGDI. Problem is that it checks if NTDDI_WIN7 is defined, I suppose it means it will be enabled only in Win7, right?\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/scintilla/win32/ScintillaWin.cxx#L34\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/scintilla/win32/PlatWin.cxx#L29\nAnyway, when I compiled bypassing that check, Npp crashed right at initialization when using these directx functions. Haven't debugged yet, as today I was looking at other things.\n. Sorry, I'm no more up-to-date with npp news. Still using my build from my fork.\n. ?\nLooks ok here:\n\n. Imo, people could even ditch the idea of a new interface if we use cooler iconset and icons inside menus. (MenuIcons plugin may help).\nHaving 'big icons' using the same icons from 'standard icons' would be a good start.\nAlso, 'small icons' have the same size of 'standard icons', so imo they are doing nothing.\n. I reproduce this when using higher-dpi.\nOk directions:\nStandard -> Big <-> Standard\nStandard -> Small <-> Standard\nBad:\nSmall <-> Big\n. Imo, Lucida Console is the best font.\n. Except that Consolas will cause displeasure for those with Cleartype disabled.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas\nLucida Console looks good for every anti-alias configuration here, and is not too small in default Npp size.\nI think a good open-source alternative is DejaVu Sans Mono which, perhaps, is already used in some themes. It is also in active development, but looks more mature than Adobe's Source Code Pro.\n. > This must be a typeface included with Windows\nLucida Console\n. Why not include another, the way Donho did with Adobe's one?\n. I think this is already fixed in 6.8.1.\nAs a tip, always test with latest version before reporting issues. :smirk:\n. ooops you're actually correct, I could reproduce now.\n. I see no drawback with my changes.\n. At least remove that fugly BS_FLAT,WS_EX_STATICEDGE\n. Btw, the only thing that changed in appearance of \"Build time\" is the text color (and I added version string to make copy more useful, as requested in mentioned issue). Previously Disabled state made it gray; if you know how to change text color, it would look the same.\n. Maybe it has same effect as bool recreate = true;\nIf this is true, probably we could simplify the second call to reset(true);\n. Forgotten usage observation: with my implementation the value 0 of the border requires a restart of Npp to take effect, only if previous border width wasn't 0. Benefits are much bigger, anyway.\n. Trying to implement automatic-change. Will update this PR when done, if I succeed.\n. Sorry, can you tell me what is the problem them?\nI was a minute over to push an update to this.\nYou will see the problem is WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE\n. @donho If you don't keep contact, how do you expect anything?\nWhy so much silence?\nI need a feedback channel for my Requests. Every dev needs feedback.\n. Would you like it to remember also the current line and caret position?\n. Yes, I did that in the referenced request above.\nThe mechanism Npp uses for doing that is too basic, it simply makes use of some command-line parameters to launch a new process and open the file.\n. Give example of what exactly you are trying to do, please?\n. You can actually search text with line breaks (end-of-line characters), just select the text then press Ctrl+F or Ctrl+H (it will display then in same line, eol chars will be invisible). For typing them manually consider using Extended mode, then type \\r, \\n etc.\nBut... I don't understand the regex you tried to use... was it just ^? It just represents the start of the text, but shouldn't match anything alone.\nEdit: if you mean you tried searching a list of words like this, in regex mode it should work:\nMango\nKiwi\nApple\nBanana\nStrawberry\nBut you need to make sure your real text doesn't contain characters that Regex understand as commands, for example, if you have this:\nMango\nif (Kiwi)\n    echo \"Apple\"\nBanana\nStrawberry\nYou will need to escape the (, ) before selecting the text for search: if \\(Kiwi\\)\n. I guess you need at least VS 2013 (ie. 2013 or 2015).\n. ~~Hopefully,~~ This is the final part of my additions to PHP highlight.\n. Because it has too long lines. You need another program for diff, or this.\n. Why not enhancement? It is a great thing for the user to be able to use leftmost/rightmost pixels.\n. Imo, enhancements, as well new features, may or may not change behaviors.\nMaybe you would like to keep this for a higher version? 6.9?\n. Yes, that's a very minor drawback, if there's a way to draw a solid line there, it would fix that. (Maybe a fake window with 0 height and WS_BORDER style? Dunno if it is possible in C++ and how to place in correct position)\nBtw, the reason for keeping old behavior (ie. keep WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE) when border is more than 0, is because the scrollbar of Windows 8/8.1/10 theme has almost the same color of window/menu background (that kind of gray). Otherwise, I would just simply remove that style.\n. Imo the lack of a top/bottom line (not border) is insignificant.\n. Why you closed? Looks a good suggestion. Although I would suggest it to display the number of the line cursor is (with the number selected so we just need to type over to change), what do you think about?\n. I've the feeling that to implement your suggestion it's a matter to remove a couple lines.\nWill look deeper and test later.\n\"go at almost the same location many times\"\nDo you use Bookmarks, right? Then just press F2 to jump to marked lines... (although I think they change position following text)\n. @milipili if you want me to merge the commits, just tell me please.\n. Ok, just asked him because he usually prefer pull requests with single commit, I don't know if you have the same preference.\n. Fix #696 is missing in commit message. Need to close it.\n. Yea, it seems to need a deep update. I will prepare something...\n. Default theme or what?\nWhatever, you can easily change to fit your taste.\n. +1\n. Lol Donho, you're crazy. That is exactly what it is supposed to do: keep the old number there, in other words, it remembers the number. If you don't like that option, you may want to set the default to another one. Ref: #708\nAbout your number 1: Imo, it doesn't make the dialog confuse; if that was the case, Find & Replace dialog should be considered a disaster.\n. I'm thinking in renaming \"Options\" to \"Mode\", to make it clear that the three are modes of operation, because they're not really options.\nI was also thinking about a new one: \"Keep dialog open\", that would not close the dialog after a 'Go'.\n. Any better place to put the options?\nDialog could be made larger, so claustrophobic people won't need to have a battle when that dialog is open.\nSo, if you want something to be non-invasive, should give no options to the user, if you leave options for the user, you are doing invasive things. Yea sure...\nImo, invasive is like Facebook that leave things shared with everyone by default, so the noob user doesn't even think he can change that option.\n. \"ok good I have an option to not remember the last search\"\nMaybe Donho would like, because he didn't understand the new options...\nBut with 3 options, we need radio buttons, the last being the current one.\nImo, the current behavior is not really needed, because with the number being selected by default, the user can simply type a new number like it was since ever.\n. For those interested in my work on Go To dialog, I announce two more interesting options\n1. Keep window open\n2. Keep window on top after Go\nand some fixes. For an explanation, please read the description of the top commit here: https://github.com/Rikk/notepad-plus-plus/commits/GoToLineDlg\n\n. @donho Answer this question: Have you read #708?\n#708\n. Care to elaborate what you consider a bug and I don't?\n. What about this from #708:\n\nWhen I press Ctrl + G second time, I would expect that number \"10\" is already there and marked in gray. If I press only enter, then I jump on line 10. But if I press any other number (e.g. 15), 10 is deleted (besause is selected and grey) and number15 is there and I press enter and I am on line 15.\n. Why, if it is doing what was proposed?\nWhat matters if the number is kept when toggling between documents? What should it be set to?\n. Yes tested a lot, dialog does not move and number does not change when using Remember Last Number. What terrific problem you see?\n. I think it would need be registered in a buffer if the dialog was totally destroyed when closed, but it is not, it is just hidden. Is that what you were supposing?\n. +1\n. Isn't it already Alt+Shift+Left/Right?\n. That bad font is already removed and will not be in next version. #close\n. Will be small, I'm trying to figure out how to resize refresh and sort icons, having no luck, probably will let them as is.\n. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/539\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/629\n. Something like this?\n\n. Wanna give it a try? ~~notepad++.exe.7z~~\n. Yes, it created the need to adjust a lot of elements. Dunno if I'll have inspiration for that.\nThese things are super boring to do for win32 interfaces -- c++ and windows interfaces are so odd to implement I don't believe how devs still do it.\nThe blank space after \"transparency\" can't be fixed if that space is needed for translations (I don't know for sure) -- but the way it was implemented, it will always be a label on top of that line.\n. I know @milipili is saying things about a new interface and blabla, but afaik I still haven't seem any real work about that. Maybe they are hiding things in private repositories -- in a open-source hurting way, who knows? Or maybe just nothing done yet...\nAnyway, I'm sure it will take long time for any stable result. Even more because Don Ho seems to be a very silent person, and he takes to himself all the responsibilities regarding the future of Notepad++. If you ask me, it is like a freeware, with source available. There are a few people doing patches, but not a development community with people devoted to make it evolve.\n. Just some parenthesis:\n(1. He is not working on anything related to Npp)\n(2. He works on the same french company with milipili)\n(3. I think he doesn't care for something that don't give him money)\n\nThis is a good example of a real open-source project:\nhttps://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commits/master\n. Someone needs to pressure. And, yes, I will go away... some day.\n@milipili you think it is needed to increase these spaces h-h-h pointed?\n. It wasn't my plan to do a PR for that. Probably should not do.\nAnd look mr Donho: the buggy code writer is yourself, unless you approved so many buggy PR from other people during years of Npp development.\n. > non-tested PR\nOh fuck, you still with that idea? I test ALL my current PR. Perhaps you don't. You can't spend 1.5 minute for compiling Notepad++.\n. @h-h-h-h please tell us if the new Go To dialog in the build I provided is working or not.\n. How many times should I say: I HAVE TESTED IT.\n. ## \n\nrofl\n. No, I won't do a PR for this issue. Maybe won't do any more PR. Because my PRs are crap. Even if they are much better tested than any commit coming from donho, they are still shit.\n. @h-h-h-h npp.Rikk.7z\n. Btw, if someone want to merge this, it can be found here. As said already, I won't make a PR, because all I would receive is zero feedback and lots of .\n. Seems to be ok here. Could you paste here the name of a file that is not displayed?\n. Maybe it wrote filenames wrongly into config.xml... if they are still listed or if you've got a backup of that file you could edit it to compare the entries...\nAnyway, I think 'issue' could be \"closed\" as it was only a false-alert :)\n. You can workaround this problem just by changing from one tab to other, it will then clear the underline and link.\n. What I'm seeing is that whoever invented this function, created only the addHotSpot() function, but forgot to create a reverse removeHotSpot().\nAnyway, it should be removed when changing tabs.\nMy suggestion, ignore this fluffy option and use links in web browsers only.\n. Dupe of https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/400\n. I vote for keeping 'length'; not against adding others, though.\n(But statusbar has some serious resize issues that imo are more interesting to see fixed.)\n. The reason I set it to 3, was to avoid the bottom of toolbar to touch the highlight square of the buttons. I dunno if exist, but the ideal would be a property that position buttons at middle independently of the height...\nhumm maybe padding... I'll investigate...\n. My count of pixels differs\u00b9, but you're right, there's one extra bellow. (\u00b9 It's possibly due to different Windows themes)\nI think we can simplify the function removing the 'padding' variable, as I see it is not used anywhere for the toolbar, thus I see no need to get its value.\nSo, I suggest this diff:\ndiff\nint ToolBar::getHeight() const {\n    DWORD size = (DWORD)SendMessage(_hSelf, TB_GETBUTTONSIZE, 0, 0);\n-   DWORD padding = (DWORD)SendMessage(_hSelf, TB_GETPADDING, 0, 0);\n-   int totalHeight = HIWORD(size) + HIWORD(padding) - 3;\n-   return totalHeight;\n+   return HIWORD(size) + 2;\n}\nI think adding a value is more predictable than removing.\nIf you agree, could you amend/rewrite the commit?\nThank you.\n. It was always a false resize mark...\n.

Isn't it what happens with .php files?\nIf you have the php open tag <?php it will highlight as PHP; if you remove the open tag, it will highlight as HTML; if you have JS open tag <script> in any part of HTML, it will highlight as Javascript.\nCSS highlight only works in .css files, however.\nAnyway, having highlight for all possible languages inside a single file, afaik is not how Scintilla lexers work, thus it would require a very huge work for small gains.\n. ``` cpp\nbool Notepad_plus::fileSaveSpecific(const generic_string& fileNameToSave)\n{\n    BufferID idToSave = _mainDocTab.findBufferByName(fileNameToSave.c_str());\n    if (idToSave == BUFFER_INVALID)\n        idToSave = _subDocTab.findBufferByName(fileNameToSave.c_str());\n    else\n    {\n        fileSave(idToSave);\n        checkDocState();\n        return true;\n    }\nreturn false;\n\n}\n``\n. Could you please describe in which situations this crash happens and how to reproduce?\n. The official author is neglecting the [already done fix](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/707) for that old and important issue.\nYou can use, however, my [Plus edition](https://github.com/Rikk/notepad-plus-plus) if you need a fixed version.\n. You mean intag?\nIn this case, it should not end with/>because it is not a self-closing tag; its block is closed withthat is after its contents. When it has no sub-items, it will have the/>and no` after.\n. I'm not sure the second word should have capital letter, as it appear followed by 'X hits', eg. \"Find result - 3 hits\".\nImo, it could also be \"Search results: X hits\".\nBtw, in Search menu, that docking panel is called \"Search Results Window\".\n. Imo, it's wrong and strange. Doesn't fallow any Windows or written language conventions.\nBoth words capitalized would make sense in a title, but not in a description.\nUnless it only contained \"Find Results\" in the title, I would agree, but because it has extra text, imo, it should be \"Find results: 100 hits\" as it looks like a sentence/phrase. (Although I prefer \"Search results: 100 hits\").\n. Why me? I don't help Npp anymore, the entire project is handled and slowed by only one sir: donho.\nSince last year there are hundreds of proposed fixes that are simply ignored. I can't imagine the amount that existed before, in SF era. I, at least, don't like to help this kind of project. Good luck.\n. I think @donho changed the forum badge to an orange version after you updated this commit...\n354 should fix this and use the one I made in SVG...\n@donho needs to upload it to https://notepad-plus-plus.org/assets/images/ for permanent use, however.\n.

I think the issue was a temporary one with SourceForge because I just tried it again and it worked without giving that message, so that implies there is some type of validation/hash check on the file to make sure it is the correct one before running the update.\nAs for your recommendation about not updating pre-installed plugins, I'm not sure I follow the logic.  If there are updates to Notepad++ and updates to the pre-packaged plugins it would seem a lot more likely that NOT updating the plugins could eventually break things.

Is there anything I can help with this issue?\n. Certum offers a free certificate for signing FOSS (it's the same like the paid one, just without the fee and with a little more information to give them [about the project, the role of the person requesting the certificate, ...]). Works like a charm.\nAnd yes: certum is in windows root certificate list, therefore the certificates (both paid and free for FOSS) are accepted by the system.\nTo get a certificate needs ca. 30 minutes work (including manually changing the site language to English from time to time ;-).\nTo use it needs some time - but as most of the necessary work is already described above I'd guess this needs another 30 minutes. If there's any question I can help.\n. Did you register for the certificate yet? They just changed the free certificate to only be heavily reduced (now 14 EUR). It's still a reasonable price, you may find someone to sponsor it @megabreakfast the company you work for may do so as it sounds this would save more expensive work time.\nThe URL is the same as before http://www.certum.eu/certum/cert,offer_en_open_source_cs.xml\n. > @GitMensch I may need your competence for code signing. I'll keep you update. Hopefully v6.9 will be signed with the new certificate!\nSure. Please check the suggested changes at https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/49#issuecomment-117051730 for a starting point.\n\nlooks nice :-)\nSimon\n. While Vista can be ignored it's best to sign the uninstaller, too - depending on local settings (including group policies) there can be sometimes problems otherwise.\nKeep in mind that the signing does not only provide a mechanism that \"Don did this\" but also for \"and nobody else changed the binaries afterwards\". (BTW: It's quite easy to replace uninstallers with bad software ;-))\n\nI don't still figure out how to pass the arguments $%NPP_CERT% and $%NPP_CERT_PWD% into nsis script\n\nIt's quite some time before I did this, but my understanding of the process is:\n``` cmd\n::: setting up the environment vars that NSIS will pick up with the special $%env_var% param\nset NPP_CERT=C:/path/to/cert\nrem only do so if you're lazy, otherwise enter it each time\nrem set NPP_CERT_PWD=YourAwes0m3~Pazsw@rd\nset /P NPP_CERT_PWD=Don, give me your password: \n::: run either the script, or the IDE/whatever you use to start the signing later here\n```\nSimon\n. Just rechecked with current NPP - works like a charm. One additional request: is it possible to include the Plugin NppAdminAccess.exe (Extension \"SaveAsAdmin\") and sign this executable, too - or even better: include the code parts and replace this message box (as the current \"included procedure\" will loose any changes and the track of the opened file)?\n```\nSave failed\nThe file cannot be saved and it may be protected.\nDo you want to launch Notepad++ in Administrator mode?\n\nYes   No\n```\n. @donho: Can you please sign the GPUP.exe that is used with NPP, too?. @milipili Yes, the UAC plugin seems to do what's necessary:\n\nThe only thing the UAC plugin was designed to do is allowing the finish page's Run checkbox to launch the app at userlevel, after elevation has occured for the installer.\n\nIn any case: MS's \"design\" intend for installers is: start non-elevated (either as admin or as normal user), as soon as the rights will be necessary (for example you've checked a possible \"install for all users\" checkbox and/or install to ProgramFiles) present a button to the user for example \"finish\" with the UAC logo. If clicked you'll get an UAC prompt and this installation part will go on elevated (while the normal part stays alive).\nThe important part here is to only do the stuff in the elevated part which has to be elevated, see UAC-Guidelines for Packages (applies to Windows Installer Packages but the principle is the same).\n. The question could be closed (and tagged as question), couldn't it?\n. @nunoperalta You're right that you can insert anything in column 1-6 but I think this problem is a problem in the Scintilla components. I wonder if the fix to this bug in Scintilla https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/bugs/977/ was integrated into NPP?\n. Just to make this clear:\nCurrently only 1cb344f can be merged now (57424d3 needs additional patches applied before)\n. 1cb344f can be merged directly to provide the functionality - please do this.\n57424d3 needs an additional patch, I don't know if it was updated, the older version @SF worked, but quite some time passed since then - maybe it was even integrated already?\n. Sure, you meant for \"better functionality for COBOL to function list\" for 57424d3 ?\nIs 1cb344f already merged?\nIs the patch from SF, mentioned in (and solving) #344 in?\n. @donho For simplifying this for me I've reimplemented this to current master (the problem was an not escaped ampersand). Here is the version that works with the current NPP version:\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n\nFor learning making your language parser, please check the following

And that I'll open a new PR as soon as #344 is fixed?\n. note: complete PR as requested with https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/4004. What should [^&gt;]+&gt; match? In any case: you've changed the file in %APPDATA%, didn't you?\n. Good to know that you're changing the correct functionlist (didn't thought about the portable version).\nAnd yes, looks like a bug to me as I cannot get this (working) parser to be applied with \n<association ext=\".cfc\" id=\"cf_function\" />\nDoes this work for you with other items? It looks like current functionlist only works with the built-in languages (I guess user defined languages will work too) but not with associations.\nTo verify that the parser works I've replaced the association line by\n<association langID=\"0\" id=\"cf_function\" />\nand set the style to \"Normal Text\". The result is fine.\n@thdoan You may want to change the issue title to \"functionlist.xml: extension based association not working\"\n.

So no PR for the patch yet.\n. Thank you for this information\n. The UAC in gpup is likely a result of a manifest (=always run be Windows), and not by an elevating command. And yes: it would be actual nice to only request administrative privileges if the install is done to the main program directory. . This issue is only indirect related to NPP any more and should be closed in favour of https://github.com/gup4win/wingup/issues/18. As a ping... Please provide PDBs, if this can be automatically done by AppVeyor: very good.\n@milipili Can you adjust the appveyor.yml to do so?\nNote: I found https://www.wintellect.com/correctly-creating-native-c-release-build-pdbs a good read how to adjust the project files to create good PDBs for release builds without any recognizable performance penalty within the release binaries.\n. Just re-encountered this issue with \u00a7 not being counted when the encoding is ANSI (it is in every other encoding).\n@milipili Can you please move this to a recent milestone list (6.x would have been nice but the error is still in 7.5.4).\nNote: The \"real\" bug here seems to be the character set as \u00a7 is not part of ANSI. If the encoding is converted from UTF-8 (where \u00a7 is counted) to ANSI the \u00a7 is not counted. When I change the character set to ISO-8859-1 (which is the actual character set you see and enter...) the character \u00a7 is counted.\nThis would be OK if we could set the default of ANSI files to an encoding, but it isn't possible (only for new files). Taken the file using ISO-8859-1 character set, save+close it, reopen it... and you're back to the plain ANSI encoding where the \u00a7 is not counted :-(. @Zeriph Please update your PR as I miss this option in NPP much\n. This sounds both useful and relatively simple to implement. \n. Yes, that's correct. I suggest to do it the way Hackedit does it and list everything used and the versions of these libraries:\n\nCan I request a change of the issue tilte to \"Show versions of all external libraries used in About Window\"?\nBTW: I really like the tabs in the about window and the information they show, to have this in NPP would be cool :-)\n. I don't think it's a good idea to implement this and always listen to these messages as it's not a common feature (checked some apps on Windows 7 including apps Firefox v44, Windows Explorer, and other editors - no one has it) and will destroy the common feature that the active window always gets access to these messages.\nI vote for \"close\" - if someone wants to change the Windows standard behaviour and installs an external software he knows about the change.\n. @h-h-h-h Yes I think \"if it works\" it would be a nice feature.\n@milipili Do you know of any possible security issues? Should we discuss this here more or create a new feature request issue directly?\n. Thank you for your answer.\nIt doesn't work for me if NPP was opened as Administrator and the drag'n'drop comes from a \"normal\" explorer / another application.\nNotepad++ v6.9\nBuild time : Feb 21 2016 - 21:27:55\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : ON\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 7\nPlugins : CodeAlignmentNpp.dll ComparePlugin.dll LocationNavigate.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExec.dll NppExport.dll NppFTP.dll NppJumpList.dll nppplugin_ofis2.dll nppplugin_solutionhub.dll nppplugin_solutionhub_ui.dll nppplugin_svn.dll NppSaveAsAdmin.dll PluginManager.dll SourceCookifier.dll SpellChecker.dll\nYou can see the + when dragging in the tab area, on drop nothing happens.

Vote for closing this issue as something like wont-fix.\n. This \"plugin\" is for PyQT apps and written in Python, therefore not usable here at all - but as it has everything a good \"report issue\" should have I still wanted to link it as reference:\nhttps://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QCrash/\n. I've checked preferences dialogue in NPP 6.8.8 and did not found the setting - do I have to wait for a new update or is it in - if yes: where?\nAs soon as it's in I think #1071 can be closed with a comment how to set this option.\n. Thank you, I've see it now.\nRechecked: This doesn't solve #1071.\n. Just for reference: SaveAsAdmin works perfectly for me and adds an UAC window, for example when writing the hosts file. If I neglect current NPP shows\n```\nSave failed\nThe file cannot be saved and it may be protected.\nDo you want to launch Notepad++ in Administrator mode?\n\nYes   No\n```\n. @milipili Do you know of any reason the updated definition is not in? I'm no python guy, but wondered about this old maybe enhancement not being in.\n. Please close as duplicate (making it easier to find the \"real\" one).\n. I have the problem \"everything opens as JSON\", too and it occurs when opening a file via file association to NPP (Windows 10). If I close the file and reopen it from History the syntax highlighting is correct.\n. Same issue here with NPP 6.9.2. Additional information: the EOL information isn't updated as long as the file is open:\n- create text file with Unix EOL\n- open and save text file with Wordpad (reads both unix and win EOL but always stores with win EOL)\n- NPP wants to reload, decline\n- manually reload (File->Reload): EOL stays on unix\n. necessary changes done, see https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/4004 (note: the original SciTE-file cobol.properties was updated, beforehand)\nAdditional note: I don't know why but the two reserved words value and values are in but not highlighted any more - as much more words are highlighted that were missing before I still consider it \"ok\". While I think that the issue roots in the OS (actually two OS with the same architecture: client+server) it is obviously an issue that happens with the installer. I guess the solution is to run the program after the installation different than the current version does.\n@SinghRajenM The link you've provided is specific to \"opening system settings raise this error\" but the issue here is \"open a lnk file raises the error\" (which is done by the installer).. Yes, both.. Notepad++ v7.3.2   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Feb 12 2017 - 23:15:39\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10 (64-bit)\nPlugins : ComparePlugin.dll LocationNavigate.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll PluginManager.dll SourceCookifier.dll\nAs this is only a post-install one-time issue created by the installer the plugins are not really interesting. The one thing that is currently missing in the Debug info and which is very  important on Windows 10 is the build number. The exact versions tested are Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard, Build 9600.18543 and Windows 10 (1607), Build 14393.693.\nAn issue for showing the exact version is created in #2976.. It is an OS issue. The tested system just don't start any lnk files directly. The installer part here is that a direct execution of %allusersprofile%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Notepad++\\Notepad++ would work and would be preferable to creating and executing %temp%\\npp.lnk.. Nice to have the OS name properly, the pull request makes the current implementation better.\nChecking the current code there are some side effects of the current way of getting the OS which would be better with checking the registry:\n\nthe current code is much more than the registry lookup (of a key that is officially documented and therefore unlikely to change and accessible for reading with nearly no rights)\nthe current code doesn't apply to newer versions of windows - you'd always have to add code for this\nyou don't get the flavor (this can be important as some features simply don't exist in minimal versions)\nfor Windows 10+: you don't get the build number - after using Windows 10 including but not limited to the Insider builds I know that some strange behavior only exist in older builds (or in new Insider builds where some software just stops to work because MS changed something)\n\nYou may argue that NPP doesn't use these features but you don't know if this is true in the future and I wonder why it shouldn't show this information if it can get it reliable and more easy than the current implementation.. You've closed the merge request - but this wasn't what I've original suggested. I suggested to only\n change the debug information (as this is the place where it is relevant). I suggested to replace the current debug info output by output the values of documented HKLM keys.\n@donho Please re-open or drop a note concerning the original request. Thank you.. I've checked the occurrences of winVer (using GitHub) and the fix is complete. The only parts where the fix was not correct is in https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/2986/commits/7c25cde1ee848911ca61863259b322259ea28b8f#diff-f898b2bd88be20761bd1b393779b810f as \"several places\" compare the enum with >= and therefore the order in the definition must use the \"old\" constants first. It must be \nenum winVer{ WV_UNKNOWN, WV_WIN32S, WV_95, WV_98, WV_ME, WV_NT, WV_W2K, WV_XP, WV_S2003, WV_XPX64, WV_SHOME, WV_S2003R2, WV_VISTA, WV_S2008, WV_S2008R2, WV_WIN7, WV_WIN8, WV_S2012, WV_WIN81, WV_S2012R2, WV_WIN10, WV_S2016};. > Deleting branch as PR will be merged.\nDid you mean \"will not be merged\"?. It would be indeed very useful but ideally should be a configurable multi-highlighter (you can have both tools generate C or C++ source).. Note: While the auto-complete of words with hyphens (included in additionalWordChar) works for the keyword FORMATTED-DATE ([CTRL]+[SPACE] shows it), it doesn't work for the function parameters (when typing a ( after the word the parameters don't show). Is there anything I can do to fix this or should I file a bug?. @MAPJe71 Applied most of your comments. Note: We tweaked these entries back in 2015 together, I would actually need time to fully understand and explain these regexes. But as the functionList still doesn't support COBOL at all I consider it better to use these as they are than waiting for me to come back to them in 2018/2019. Note: I don't know if the old comment boundaries problem is fixed by now (there was a request for you to redo your patch back then), if they are the commented one for free-form reference-format may be retested.\n... just rechecked:\nhttps://svn.code.sf.net/p/open-cobol/contrib/trunk/samples/prime_machine/prime_machine.cob works fine with the \"simple\" cobol_section_free variant which is active in the suggested PR but not with the extended one including the paragraphs.. @donho The \"common style issues\" mentioned by @MAPJe71 were fixed, all CI and manual checks passed and #2731 is fixed by this - is there anything \"open\" on your side before including this one?. This would indeed be nice to be able to fast compare the installer content against the source repository.\nNote: GitHub allows the source to be cloned via an svn interface, too - and this doesn't enforce any of the rules in .gitattributes - to enforce this with all PR the verifying of the .gitattributes (or at least the CRLF part) must have to be added to CI, too.. > The problem becomes worse since the Notepad++ installer is not digitally signed and the only source of trust is the originating website. Where I cannot see the originating website, I have to trust that the application performs the relevant checks for me \u2013 and it doesn't.\nIf this is true then you where hijacked... The NPP installer is digitally signed since some months.. ... and as the comments in the news post already outline: https is only a minor helper (=better than nothing but doesn't solve the issue) as long as the certificates are not guaranteed to be correct.\nTo be sure the file itself is not tampered it has to be verified after download by its hash and/or certificate (do matter if http or https or ftp or whatever protocol was used to transfer the file). This may be possible when the update client has the public key integrated for the certificate that is used to sign the executable.. > I got the question to upgrade from 32 bit to x64.

    "rcdailey": "+1\n. @milipili Hogwash. There is nothing a C++ style cast can't do that a C-style cast can do.\nC++ style casts are safer because it makes you choose a specific cast for a specific intent. It makes code more self documenting, safer, more robust, and more type safe. C-Style casts are still in C++ the same reason why structs and everything else are still here: backward compatibility. That doesn't mean you should use them.\nProgrammers that use C-style casts are just lazy.\n. Yeah you can do git filter-branch, but you will be rewriting history.

I'll zip the clone and send it to you, and leave it up to you to force-push the master branch over what you have now.\nLet me know what you decide (especially want feedback from @donho).\n. @donho You can't rely on github to show you the true diff, I don't believe.\nMy commit removes all carriage returns from files that had them (0x0D). Internally, git likes to store files with only line-feed characters (LF). The .gitattributes file will assist in making sure files in your working copy contain CRLF on windows, and when you commit them, the CRLF is transparently converted back to LF for storage in the repository.\nBasically there is this constant transition between LF and CRLF on Windows:\nWhen you checkout, it goes from LF -> CRLF\nWhen you commit, it goes from CRLF -> LF\nThis only applies to text files matched under * text=auto in the .gitattributes file. You can override files to always have LF on checkout (no conversion) by doing mybashscript.sh eol=lf.\nTo see the actual line ending changes in a diff, you'd have to check out the branch or PR and do:\n$ git diff -R HEAD^\n-R will show you the reverse of the diff (it will show you the conversion from LF -> CRLF). Git will never show LF in diffs, only CR. And it will only show CR (0x0D) when it is introduced not removed. That's why -R is necessary here; to see a diff where CR is introduced (I removed it in my diff, so naturally we need to reverse the diff to see it).\n. @donho I've just rebased this branch onto latest in master. Each time master changes, I have to rebase my branch again. So I hope you will merge this soon.\n. @donho You are wrong on several points.\n- Git blame will still function (use -w option), as indicated earlier on by someone else. See the documentation for more detail.\n  - Optionally you can do a rewrite of history to normalize everything, but it's unnecessary when you have -w with git blame. It will also invalidate all existing PRs and forks.\n- Why are you saying you \"don't know what changed in these files\"? I just explained it to you. There is nothing but line ending changes.\n- The line endings are stored as CRLF inside the repository right now. This is incorrect!. They are supposed to be LF inside the repo, and the .gitattributes will convert them to CRLF on checkout as needed. This is how all git repositories work with proper .gitattributes files.\n- Accepting only the .gitattributes will create no end to headache for you. Files will show up as modified when you didn't change them, because git is converting line endings. That is why you need to normalize line endings all at once to avoid this.\nDon, I have explained everything in great detail in my posts throughout this pull request. It is obvious to me you have not read any of this, because of the statements you are making which are untrue.\nPlease go back and read everything, especially the articles I linked. I encourage you to reopen this PR and merge it properly.\n. @ariccio Read the thread. You are asking for links/etc but it's all here. I can't make it any easier for you.\nAnd there is no attack going on here. Simply stating the facts. All I'm asking people to do is just read.\n. I've had enough experience with line ending issues and done enough hours of research on it to basically \"know what's best\", although I understand the \"Just trust me\" mentality doesn't get accepted very well.\nI just want everyone to know I have good intentions here and I do not intend to rush the issue as some people think. \nI agree that a PR is one of the less effective ways to get this change in but I did so anyway, leaving the call up to @donho. If it were me personally I would do the history rewrite. I did that for several SVN conversions to Git and it's the best way to go if you catch it early enough. As I've said all along, the harm is in that the repository has already gone public and there will be some collateral damage. However this is recoverable if everyone knows how to do a proper rebase of their branches.\nOn the other hand, forcibly dealing with the whitespace change in history can be a pain as well even though there are \"ignore whitespace\" options available. You'd need to be consciously aware of it and make sure to specify the correct parameters. This could get annoying for those less familiar with the actual history of the repository.\n@milipili Slight correction to your explanation. Git will convert line endings per users configuration if there is no .gitattributes. That means that there is potential for confusing and seemingly superfluous diffs in pull requests on a per-user basis due to line ending conversions. It puts the burden on the contributors instead of the issue being handled transparently and most importantly consistently by having a .gitattributes file.\nMy apologies if I sounded frustrated; unfortunately my tone does not carry well through text so I can understand where I would sound pushy/frustrated. In any case, per Don's request I shall remove the line ending normalization commit and leave the .gitattributes file. I will let him decide how to perform the line ending normalization based on the collective information I've provided.\n@donho I'm available for questions if you have any!\nThanks everyone for the feedback and discussion.\n. Personally I would not recommend using precompiled headers.\nI recommend enabling parallel builds (/MP). You can get up to 8 translation units compiling simultaneously with 8 logical CPUs. Note that turning on /MP requires turning off /Gm and precompiled headers.\nAnother issue I have with precompiled headers is that they encourage poor include management. You will be stuffing includes in a single header file that every single translation unit includes, regardless of whether or not they need them. On toolchains that do not support precompiled headers, you will be drastically increasing compile times.\nAlso precompiled headers do not require you to properly setup include dependencies on a per-header, per-translation-unit basis. So if you were to take a subset of source files that may work independently and use them outside of Notepad++, chances are they will fail to compile because they do not properly manage their own includes / dependencies.\n. @NN--- also #pragma once does not fix repetitive include directives, that just boils down to lack of proper inclusion management. Also not to mention #pragma directives are by-design platform defined. So using them in C++ runs the risk of making the code less portable.\n. @NN--- I understand that there is broken/incomplete support for PCH in the current setup. I am recommending you remove all remaining signs of PCH usage.\nI understand what precompiled headers are for. The performance gain is not worth the maintenance burden.\nYes you can add includes where you think they might be needed but the compiler will not help you in the effort. If you introduce new symbols in a file and forget to add a corresponding set of #include directives, the compiler will not help you remember when you have PCH enabled.\nDoesn't matter if Notepad++ isn't currently portable. Also portability means many things: Not necessarily platform (Linux, Mac OS), but toolchain (GCC or Clang on Windows; Cygwin). Also a portion of Notepad++ may be usable outside of Windows. As I stated before, what if that code needs to be turned into some sort of small library for another project?\nYou can never know where your C++ code may end up 10 years from now. But the main goal should always be to follow the C++ standard and do things as portable and correct as possible.\nAlso your example code makes zero sense and is counter productive. It's much clearer to just use include guards and be done with it.\nAnyway my suggestion still stands: Use multiprocessor build configuration, disable PCH, profit. \n. @donho Have you done a test with /MP on?\n. @NN--- No need to go over basics with me, I understand the similarities and differences.\nAlso optimization-wise what you say is not true. Some compilers have documented optimizations in compile time when using include guards. Some also optimize on #pragma once. Either way it's implementation defined. You could use both, but it's unconventional and extra maintenance for very little (if any) benefit. There is nothing that states you must use both. That's your personal preference.\nIf the code base is already using include guards, then keep using them. If it's using #pragma once, then keep using it. If you have a special need (like checking if a header has been included), you can choose include guard for that instead of the pragma.\n@donho Please hold off on merging this as I plan to do a PR that enables multiprocessor build and eliminates usage of PCH. I will provide timing results as well.\nAgain I want to caution the impact of enabling PCH. Dependency management will no longer be compiler-enforced and will significantly degrade over time.\n. Please see PR #90 for a change I made to enable parallel builds. Build times I've observed is 1 second longer than PCH but does not come with the maintenance burden that PCH brings.\n@NN--- I'm not going to debate #pragma once vs include guards here, it's off topic. If you want to improve build times so you can move on to other tasks, I recommend you take a look at PR #90 and run some tests on your own machine and measure the differences.\nIf you also find performance improvements using #pragma once, by all means introduce that change but this specific concern I have is with project configuration only.\n. Any reason you couldn't just accept the merge and save yourself some trouble?\n. FYI I have also done this in #90 \n. I can see how using a keyboard modifier would possibly make this easier to implement (no UI changes would be needed). However from a usability perspective I would prefer to see a \"No to All\" button. The shift key approach seems like it would most likely go unnoticed.\nEither way you go about it, saying no to all seems like a dangerous shortcut to provide to the user. I'd much rather be annoyed by 1 prompt per file than to lose unsaved changes.\nPersonally I get around this issue by using Y and N keys as shortcuts. For each prompt I just press a key. It isn't perfect but at least for me much quicker than having to move my mouse cursor around to click buttons.\nJust some food for thought. Ultimately I'm not opposed to the idea. Just a bit overly cautious.\n. @NN--- I will restore it in this PR because it is unrelated to the topic change.\nHowever I believe Notepad++ should not statically link the runtimes. The installer should be updated to silently install the redistributable if necessary.\nI will make that a separate pull request.\n. @NN--- There are a bunch of reasons to prefer DLLs over static linking the runtimes. I won't go over all of them here (feel free to read the SO post, it's very informative).\nThe benefits of static linking become less useful when you have an installer that can transparently setup redistributables anyway. So it's a no-brainer to choose DLL for runtime, IMHO.\nWe can discuss in more detail in a related PR later, if you wish. You've made a good point about reverting the runtime change here, so I have done that to keep the PR focused. \n. @NN--- Again I do not want to discuss static/dynamic runtime linking here, I am shelving that discussion for another time.\nThe build time for multi-process will significantly improve even further after the elimination of precompiledHeaders.h. Doing so will mean translation units include only what they need instead of the same set of tens of files being compiled over and over again.\n. @NN--- I don't know why I have to go over basic arguments with you. Look at precompiledHeaders.h Every single one of those includes are being compiled per translation unit that includes it (that's everything or close to it). Not every translation unit requires all the headers that precompiledHeaders.h includes.\nAnyway this is a bigger second cleanup phase. Not worth going into detail right now.\n. Precompiled headers may not be enabled with parallel builds.\nOn Mon, May 18, 2015, 7:01 PM NN notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nBtw, can you please measure time of Precompiled headers with multiprocess\nenabled ?\nThanks.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/pull/90#issuecomment-103274033\n.\n. @NN--- When you compile you will get a warning from the compiler that PCH are ignored.\n\nAlso all it takes is a little bit of reading to figure out which compiler switches are incompatible with /MP.\n. +1\n. Would be better to add CMake support, IMHO. Even though it will not be used to generate projects for platforms other than Windows, it will allow 1 set of scripts to generate project files for any version of Visual Studio. Also it will open the door to compiling the code base with other toolchains on Windows like Clang.\n. Obvious question, but have you tried cppcheck?\n. +1, great contribution.\nThis answers that age-old question: How do you eat an elephant?\nOne bite at a time.\n. This is just as useful as anything else. Reduction of technical debt and conformance to modern coding principles. I'd take that any day.\n. I agree with @ariccio on this. Saying you do not want refactoring PRs is failing to address the insane amount of technical debt in the code base. I think @donho should feel fortunate and accepting of the fact that there are people out there that care enough to address the issues instead of walling them off.\nBut it's not my project.\n. Thanks for the idea. At the moment I'm just trying to sort out the mess of the main app. The other apps seem simpler.\n. @donho You have a very large code base. Everything is clumped together and built as a single executable. However, you obviously have common code (WinControls is a good example) which should be separated out.\nAt the moment I am trying to build a few key pieces as static libraries. This is a means to allowing code to be compiled in isolation. This will expose circular dependencies and other dependency problems. It also encourages proper modularization of code and code location.\nWhen everything is just one big blob of source files, you won't see these problems.\n. @dail8859 My understanding years ago is that Don is phasing out this method of syntax highlighting for a more GUI-driven system in Notepad++ (Define Custom Language option, I think).\nI wanted to wait for @donho's feedback.\nThanks for the info though.\n. @donho You probably don't remember, but a few years ago I contacted you about this. At the time I did provide an updated XML file, but you instead preferred setting up CMake in UDL. I'm not sure if you are still using that system. Personally I found it rather over engineered and complex for the task.\nAnother issue is that functions (function, macro: red by default), conditionals (if, endif: purple by default), and looping constructs (foreach, endforeach: teal by default) are hard-coded in C++ I believe. If not all of them, I know some of them are. I can't remember exactly.\nSo this change isn't completely tied to just the XML implementation. Any thoughts on this? Going forward do you truly expect people to modify XML and/or C++ code to extend the syntax highlighting capabilities of a language?\nI will get started on the work and have a PR up. But I just wanted to remind you about UDL and see if that's still a \"thing\".\n. I am modifying the lexer for function/endfunction keywords. Need code folding support for these as well. How do you prefer to make this change?\n. So an interim change directly to the checked in source code makes more\nsense then.\nOn Tue, Aug 18, 2015 at 8:57 AM dail8859 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSo just keep in mind that means it will be a while before those changes\npropagate into the N++ repository since Scintilla isn't updated that often\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commits/master/scintilla/version.txt\n.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/732#issuecomment-132217001\n.\n.

So something isn't registering right.\nHow can I test changes to languages and such?\n. I have to be blunt here. I think it was a poor decision to remove the Plugin Manager without a suitable replacement. AFAIK, there is no longer a built-in mechanism to install, remove, and update plugins. This creates a serious usability issue with Notepad++.\nFor months now, I have had to avoid upgrading until a replacement is implemented. I haven't kept up with release notes, so I don't know if a replacement has been provided yet. But that's part of the reason I stumbled upon this issue is that I'm trying to figure that out.. When it comes to things passed by-value in C++ functions, there isn't too much value in making them const. Essentially you're trying to \"protect the copy\", which if changed, doesn't really break anything anyway. Also the change is not observable from the caller. You couldn't write a unit test to verify whether or not the copy was changed. This IMHO comes down to KISS principle; use const in more pragmatic ways and you eliminate some arguably unnecessary verbosity from your code and make it look more natural and readable.\n. @ariccio Overlooking the disturbing amount of political incorrectness of your analogies, it seems you recognize your perspective is flawed yet you continue to justify your suggestions for your own personal preferences. There is no general consensus that agrees with your preference of const for by-value parameters. In any case I'm at fault for something here too, and that is the continuation of and contribution to a conversation which has run its course on a topic that isn't very important to begin with. I'm sure there are far more valuable discussion we can have on this PR without wasting everyone's time. I apologize for becoming involved in the discussion, I'll try to avoid this topic next time :)\n. Nitpick: Seems like this code and possibly surrounding code (I can't see all of it) belongs in a reusable private method or something.\n. There is no functional requirement for an EOF newline here, I think it is\nsilly that github even points this out.\nOn Fri, May 22, 2015, 12:29 AM Alexander Riccio notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIn .gitignore\nhttps://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/pull/85#discussion_r30870190:\n\n.out\n+.app\n+\n+*.tlog\n\nGrr.\n[image: no_nl]\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2142308/7764624/022e78c6-0022-11e5-9895-6742213f8c78.PNG\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus/pull/85/files#r30870190.\n.

These modifications looks fine to me.\nActually, I had to plan to update whole translation again because - \n1. Translation for many words/sentences are still missing\n2. Few items go beyond the specified length.\n3. Few are wrongs as well.\n@vkdinventor may I ask you to revise whole file again considering above cases?\nAlso avoid tough translation (e.g. foe encoding -> \u090f\u0928\u094d\u0915\u094b\u0921\u093f\u0902\u0917 still looks better than \u0938\u0902\u0915\u0947\u0924\u0940\u0915\u0930\u0923)\nScreenshot contains few items, there are many more.\n\n. As there was no update for long time. So I decided to update the whole xml myself. I have made all the required change in PR #2375. Please consider #2375 .\n. Adding screenshots...... \n\n\n\n\n. Hello @Yaron10,\nThank you for your feedback. But at this moment changing localization is bit tough in order to reduce the string length.  Also it has to be updated by various persons which is again time consuming activity.\nTherefore to make it simpler, I have provided indention for  \". matches newline\" similar to other items such as \"preference ->New Document -> Encoding\", \"Preference -> Editing ->Vertical Edge Setting\" etc.\nI think, it should okay.\n\n. Adding screenshot from temp just after installing npp 6.9.2\n\n. messed up.. Too many commits......\n. Closing as V6.9.2 old version. @MAPJe71 x64 and x86 is no more related to MS. I just took reference to show the difference. Many of applications such as Firefox (can see in the screenshot as well), 7zip etc use it.\nAnyway, the intention was to differentiate the npp version in installed program list.\nI'm sure, lot of DV PCs are loaded with 32bit NPP version. After installing x64 bit, if they wish to uninstall 64bit (may be due to lack of plugins at this moment) or uninstall 32bit (they may like 64bit more), then it is hard to identify which one to pick. \nHowever, from uninstaller window (if they really look at Uninstalling from C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++), they may realize which version they are going to uninstall.\nSo just to simplify this task, it is good to write 64bit or 32bit details as well.\n. Now managed as 1 commit for per PR.\nFor . match newline width has to changed from 67 to 68 (it was not translated and english string was little chooped.). I think, minor width adjustment should not be an issue.\nscreenshot is attached (it is taken from the nighty build exe  - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/donho/notepad-plus-plus/build/1.0.488/job/7xfojjtk4pvmcii3/artifacts)\n\n. Oh, I see. Thank you for confirmation.\nLet me close this ticket.\n. I use github Web for PR. So the commit count is equal to the number of\nchanged file.\nUnfortunately, I couldn't setup git on my system. I'm finding it hard to\nsetup git on my system. I will try overcome it soon.\nSorry for inconvenience caused.\nOn Oct 8, 2016 11:04 PM, \"Don HO\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@SinghRajenM https://github.com/SinghRajenM I just don't understand why\nit's always 2 commits?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/2351#issuecomment-252437728,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOGzJR0AETVFb70VvD1t-o618ZHUOjLDks5qx9QQgaJpZM4KH5d9\n.\n. No, it is not like that. I DO compile the changes and test it before submitting. Without compile it is hard to attach screenshot.\nDoes it imply that you don't even compile your commit locally?\n\nTo be frank, it disappointed me. I'm novice to github, but not to development. I understand the pain of merging uncompiled/untested code.\n. @miguelofbc  please provide debug information. (Menu -> ? -> Debug Info).\nHave you tried with latest version?\n. please provide debug information. (Menu -> ? -> Debug Info).\nHave you tried with latest version? It is not reproducible with V6.9.2 and V7.\n. This seems to be same issue as #2155. Refer the around given there, this may solve your issue.\n. Please consider this one.\n. Any reason for suspension? Does it require any input from my side?\n. There were multiple reason for many changes - \n1. Many translation were wrong and not user friendly.\n2. There were many translation missing as it was not updated parallel to notepad release for long time.\n3. It was tough to translate as it was not sync with English xml. It was taking too much time to translate one by one therefore I synced with english xml. So whenever a new items is added to english, it can be easy translated without any issue.\n. @donho I have question about the PR process. Once a PR is accepted (not merged), can we update a PR?\nI'm asking because, this PR is accepted but I would like to update for new strings which were recently added to English String.\n. @donho I have updated the translation now.\n. Fix is submitted. So closing the issue.\n. Adding screenshots - \n\n\n\n\n. @donho\n1. For flicker, open about dialog or any other dialog (from preference) which has hyperlink on win 7. Now move mouse over hyperlink. You can see hand and pointer cursors toggle so frequently which causes Flickr.\n2. For length of control, open about dialog, you can click on homepage link from outside of text as well.\nBoth the cases can be found almost for all the available links on preference window. \nRefer the previously attached screenshots.\nPlease note, this is not happening on scintilla editor links.\n. Which one? Flickering or control length?\nWhat OS are you testing on?\nFlickering:\nIn my office Dev pc (win 7 many PCs) it is reproduced? But on my personal machine (win 10) it does not.\nControl length:\nHappening on both win 10 n 7.\n. Oh, checking on Win 10. As I said before flickering issue is occurring on win 7. Due to security reason I can't record and attach here. If someone has win7 can try to reproduce, but I don't have win7.\n. > Windows built in hand cursor (which looks way better)\nYes, it is good idea to change the hand cursor as well. Moreover, scintilla hand cursor gives good look and feel. Refer the compare report.\n\n. @donho have you tried to reproduce the issue on Win7? Are you still not able to reproduce on Win7?\n. Okay, no problem!\nBut let me put the issue in two different ways. \n1. Update Notepad++\nConsider N++ is released with new shell dll say NppShell_07.dll (contains fix for some major/critical issue) and new version is available via N++ auto updater as well.\n\nA user has older version of N++ say 7.1 and he/she opens a text file using context menu\nNow user will get a popup to update N++ from auto updater\nUser proceeds to update the N++\n\nNow the issue comes, however the new update will be installed, but new shell dll will not be replaced.\n2. User uninstalls Notepad++\n\nUser uninstalls N++ and somehow he/she notices that in N++ directory is not deleted from program files \nUser tries to delete the directory manually, but it will not be deleted \nTo delete this directory user has to either restart the explorer (if user is aware about it) or restart the system.\n\nSo for both the scenarios, how you are going to deal? Is there any plan handle it?. Oops. Right, NppShell_06.dll is locked not NppShell_07.dll.\nAnyway, as you wrote solution is not perfect, can we discuss how it can be made perfect?. > No x86 Shell DLL in x64 installer\nI agree. There is no need to keep x86 NppShell_06.dll. However from user perspective, there should be no issue if it is there.\n\nSame for x86 installer that should not contain both DLLs with the SAME name.\n\nIn this case both the Dlls are required. A user can install 32bit npp version on x64 bit machine, that time NppShell x64 bit is required. About dll name, it is internal to npp. Moreover, it is not exposed to the user, so the name should not matter.\nAbout MSI, I think @donho may have a plan for it (refer: #2326).\n. Yes. It is generated from GetVersion.nsi but not during the build process.\nThis is one time activity and no need to again n again unless there is a\nbug or some changes are required.\nOn Oct 13, 2016 4:27 AM, \"Menno Vogels\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@MAPJe71 requested changes on this pull request.\nI assume the GetVersion.exe binary is generated from GetVersion.nsi\nduring the build process so there's no need to add the binary to the\nrepository.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/2409#pullrequestreview-3978665,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOGzJXtW_aeu-gCt9QZ9x1rtSrwveRXEks5qzWXcgaJpZM4KSBM0\n.\n. > In this case the source is part of the project so I'd say build it during the build process\n\nI feel it is not that much easy, moreover I don't how appveyor is configured. But if I take an example from Jenkins, it requires two jenkin jobs.\n1. Complie GetVersion.nsi which creates GetVersion.exe. \n2. Actuall npp build job\nIn this case, job 1 will be slave job of job 2. So first job 2 should trigger job 1. Once job 1 is completed, move the artifact (GetVersion.exe) from job 1 to job2  and execute it which will write version info in form of macros.\n. > Notepad++ build already has two dependencies, the Boost and Scintilla libraries, so it shouldn't be a problem for the AppVeyor build environment.\nIf so, then GetVersion.nsi should be built in different job and artifact can be moved to \"PowerEditor\\installer\\nsisInclude\" before starting npp setup creation build.\nSorry, I don't how to create jobs and dependencies in AppVeyor as we have dedicated build engineers.\n. No problem!!!\n. By any change are you using Turkish Keyboard? I could not reproduce this issue with english keyboard.\nIf yes, this issue is occuring with dotted (\u0130) and dotless (I) seems to work fine.\n. Not much attention paid..... closing.. @donho \nHmmmm, okay. So what's your opinion about clearing leftovers created by npp installer? Who should clear these leftover files, user or npp installer? IMO, it is npp installer's responsibility to clear whatever it uses for installation.\nnpp installer left around 90+ files (85 localization + few other xml files). Even if user does not select any localization (use default lang), all the localizations are copied to %temp%.\n\nI don't see the advantage to create plugins dir instead of using tmp dir.\n\nI think the description provided along screenshot should have been self explanatory. Anyway, let me explain again. Most of time $PLUGINSDIR is created automatically (based on the feature usage of nsis). \nIn our case even npp installer does not explicitly calls InitPluginsDir, but still $PLUGINSDIR (%temp%\\nsXXXXX.tmp) is created (because of language selection, later usage for some other items. Refer the attached screenshot). This $PLUGINSDIR is removed automatically once installation is over.\nSo advantage of $PLUGINSDIR:\n1. No additional efforts needed to clear leftovers from %temp%\n2. As no additional effort, less nsis script (of-cource which is less error prone)\n3. Utilize nsis built-in feature(s) instead of writing lengthy code.\n4. Last but not least, serve the purpose of this PR.\n\n. @donho conflict has been resolved now.\n. This issue occurs with every file type. Also if folder is copied on clipboard.\nLooks like if item from clipboard is not paste-able, then scintilla replaces with empty string or may be NULL which is considered as empty string. Sorry, I didn't debug the issue, it is just thought.\n. I think default operation in silent mode should be remove all the data. \nIf there is additional switch (e.g /keepprofile or -keepuserprofile or something similar) along with /s then don't remove.\n. oh no.....\n. @dail8859 , I doubt that this regression happened because of a82d9f9 as this issue can be seen with V7.1 also.\nIn V6.9.2, code was like\nC++\n::CopyFile(fn, fn_dateTime_bak.c_str(), FALSE);\nwhich was changed to (may be v7.0)\nC++\nif (not ::CopyFile(fn, fn_dateTime_bak.c_str(), FALSE))\n{\n    return false;\n}\nbecause of this save (actual file save, not backup) didn't happen as doSave was not called. However, save backup with environment variable is not working with 6.9.2 also (even is %temp/backups directory exists), but it does not block the saving actual file. \nSo I feel expanding environment variable is must.\n. Issue is fixed in e6fad9bd4f4031fdb7e05505d7c52ab39589853d. Given sample does not have --->, rather it is --> which is working absolutely fine. Moreover, using proper error reporting template (along with screenshot if possible) might give clear picture.\n. @Yaron10 @pnedev \nI've submitted fix #2664 for this issue. I'll check for #2277 .\nThank you!. @donho \nIs anything required from my end to get this PR merged?. @miguelsuddya Issue has been fixed and fixed version will be available in next release.\n. @donho \nI think, I have figured out the issue. In package.bat, change nsis version caused this issue. Nsis was changed from Unicode (a special build by third party) to regular release version.\nrem IF EXIST \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\" (\"%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\\NSIS\\Unicode\\makensis.exe\" nppSetup.nsi) ELSE (\"%PROGRAMFILES%\\NSIS\\Unicode\\makensis.exe\" nppSetup.nsi)\nIF EXIST \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\" (\"%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\\NSIS\\makensis.exe\" nppSetup.nsi) ELSE (\"%PROGRAMFILES%\\NSIS\\makensis.exe\" nppSetup.nsi)\nIF EXIST \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\" (\"%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\\NSIS\\makensis.exe\" -DARCH64 nppSetup.nsi) ELSE (\"%PROGRAMFILES%\\NSIS\\makensis.exe\" -DARCH64 nppSetup.nsi)\nIn older version of NSIS Unicode installer were in supported. Later on flag Unicode was introduced in NSIS v3.0 to created Unicode installers. \n. I feel this regression is because of #2391 \nC++\n     PUSHBUTTON      \"Find &All in Current Document\",IDC_FINDALL_CURRENTFILE,268,80,90,21,BS_MULTILINE\n     PUSHBUTTON      \"&Replace\",IDREPLACE,268,38,90,14\n     PUSHBUTTON      \"Replace &All\",IDREPLACEALL,268,56,90,14\nAccelerator key 'A' conflicts for \"Find &All in Current Document\" and \"Replace &All\". \"Find &All in Current Document\" comes first in tab order which get advantage of it.. Additionally, notepad crashes in below case always.\nSteps to reproduce\n\nOpen notepad++\nOpen more than one tab (two tabs are enough)\nPress and hold right mouse button in Notepad++ window and keep scrolling the wheel while mouse cursor is not on the doc switcher popup\n\nAt step 3, shadow of doc switcher start increasing. After certain amount of shadow, npp crashes.\n\nNotepad++ v7.2.1   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Nov 20 2016 - 22:42:51\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10\nPlugins : DSpellCheck2.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll PluginManager.dll \n. @MAPJe71 \n1. Crash is consistently happening on Win10. I couldn't investigate/debug further due to busy schedule. \n2. As @Grinderofl said, it openes multiple popup which overlap each other. Refer the screenshot.\n\n@Grinderofl \n\nNotepad++ features a facility where, when multiple tabs are opened, one can press and hold right mouse button, and use the mouse wheel to scroll through them. This opens a small popup window with the file names.\n\nDisabling Document switcher  (Settings -> Preferences ->MISC ->Uncheck \"Enable\" under doc switcher) will solve the multiple popup occurring problem, but right click+mouse will continue to function for tab switching.. Another duplicates #1619 and #2828. It is fixed in vv7.3.3.. There might be a case that Notepad++ is running as administrator (can see from debug info), while your explorer is running with lower privileges. I assume that you may have checked \"open Noptepad++\" on finish dialog which will elevate N++ (run with admin privilege).\nIf this is the case, then it is windows expected behavior. However, there are ways to handle it but again that will be lead to security issues otherwise why MS would have blocked it.\nSome links for your reference - \nstackoverflow\nMSDN blog\nI think that your test scenario is as below in which drop n drop won't work. \n\n. I feel, issue is similar to #159 and some other issues are referenced there.\n@AraHaan \nCould you please confirm that issue is occurring when NPP is launched from finish page of installer or it is occurring even if you run NPP separately?. @AraHaan thank you for confirmation.. @donho  and @dail8859 ,\n\nI think the problem is that in step 1 the user is logged in as a non-administrator account\n\nIn window 10 the case is little different. I use windows 10 and I have only single account (of course admin), but in this case explorer runs with lower privileges which is not elevated. This is default behavior which can be tweaked. Run explorer with as admin\n . UAC is very famous plugin and it is used widely. It should have been used in N++ as well. However, @donho  mentioned in his comment if anyone gets idea then let him know, he will implement it.  So I wonder why it was not implemented till then?\nIt might be the case that \n1. @donho may not want an additional nsis plugin in repository as UAC plugin is NOT included in nsis by default.\n2. I tried to automate the versioning ( #2409 ) by using an additional binary and some code which was not merged due to size for code refer comment. So I wanted (infact want in every PR) to minimize the code, but using UAC plugin requires some code along with plugin dll in repository.. This crash is irrespective of arbitrary string or combo selection. Crash happens only when you use \"Enter\" instead of mouse click on \"Ok\" button.. Three solutions are already available - \n1. Make language menu compact => settings -> Preferences -> Language ->Check \"language menu compact\".\n2. Use arrow key => Press Alt -> Press Key 'L' -> Navigate to desired language using UP/DOWN arrow keys\n3. Use Character repeatedly => on language menu keep on pressing respective key. Example, If you want to navigate to SQL, then press 'S' key four times.\nI keep language menu compact which is easy to use.. Possibly duplicate of #2641, #159, #556 and fix is submitted which may be available in next release.\nBut my curiosity is\n1. Is it happening always (even after restarting NPP)?\n2. If it is happening always, then how do you open notepad++. I mean do you open notepad++ forcefully \"Run As Administrator\" or how? I just want to know why Admin mode is ON in debug info.. @donho \n\nIt's not really neat on user experience - some zones work and some doesn't.\nObviously, we have to hack in editor component ( that I always try to avoid).\nThis patch would be accepted if the patch for Scintilla is small and concise, otherwise it's rather somethings which is not helping users IMO - they don't have necessarily the docking dialog and even they do, that creates the confusion.\n\nYes, this is not a good solution, but I wanted to discuss solution using this PR. So if someone has any idea or had solved similar problem can improve this PR.\nSomehow if we can get scintilla HWND, then we can process it similar to - \nC++\nfunc(notepad_plus_plus.getHSelf(), WM_DROPFILES, MSGFLT_ALLOW, NULL);\nAbout docking dialog, it just used for demo. Proposed code is not only working with docking dialog but also for whole Npp window (exact same as non elevated npp) except editor portion.\n\n. Didn't find solution to handle on scintilla portion. Will create a new PR if find any solution.\nClosing!!! :(. Please refer below about file size. You can see this info by double clicking on length on status bar.\n\n. @donho The issue is reproduced every time with 32 bit N++ version on Win10 64bit OS. Make sure N++window is maximized before clicking on minimize. Refer attached video capture and PSR (Problem Steps Recorder).\n\nToolBarNotVisible.zip\nLet me know if you need any info analyze the issue.\n. Yes, it is reproduced 100% even without single plugin. Refer the screenshot below from the package you shared.\n\n. Almost similar to #2603 . @MAPJe71 , Nope!\nIf you have a look on V6.9.2 or any earlier version, it works fine.\nThere are two things.\n1. Language used for installation\n\nThis will guide to install in preferred language and after installation N++ will use the selected language for all its UI.\n2. User can install multiple languages and can change it anytime from preference setting\n\nMoreover, the language count for point 1 and point are different. For example, Language Hindi is not available for 1 while it is available in 2. \nSo in latest versions of N++, second part is missing. Let me know if you still any concern. Thanks!. Npp is configured (by default) as single instance application. So when you launch it in normal user mode and then try to launch again in admin mode, it shows the same instance instead of new instance (process) and that is expected behavior.\nIf you really wish to get it work (as you expect), then configure it as multi instance (via => settings->Preferences->Multi-Instance->Always open in multi-instance mode).. With current setup, npp is launched (from finish dialog) by executing a shortcut created in temp folder. This was done to make npp integrity level same explorer's integrity level, so that drag & drop functionality continues to work.\nThis is wired situation that first time pinning works in different way than the second time for same process.\n\nLaunch npp from installer page and pin it to taskbar\nSee its property.\nUnpin it from taskbar and pin it again without restarting npp\nSee its property.\n\n\nI'm going to submit a patch to handle it. Let's see how it goes.. @glawrence \n\nUpdate: sorry, should have read more closely! Unpinning and re-pinning fixed this\n\nThis issue should not occur with V7.4.1 at all assuming it is fresh installation. If this was not fresh installation, then previous version might have already pinned to task containing \"Change.log\" as argument.\nJust to understand whether issue still persists, few questions for you - \n\nDid you install V7.4.1 freshly? If not, then the previous version was pinned to task bar?\nIf it occurs with fresh installation, then could you share us properties of pinned item showing shortcut tab?\nPlease share debug info (Open Notepad++ -> Menu -> ? -> Debug info). Could not reproduce. Is there any specific scenario to reproduce the issue? \nTry without any plugin, you can just rename \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\plugins\" and relaunch NPP.\n\n\nNotepad++ v7.3.2   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Feb 12 2017 - 23:15:39\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10 (64-bit)\nPlugins : DSpellCheck2.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll PluginManager.dll \n. Yes, with TextFX it can be reproduced. I feel there should be some setting to handle.\nAnyway, plugin related issue should be reported to respective plugin.. I could not reproduce the issue.\nI think, you're running a wrong command. As per /d switch documentation, it must not contain quotes even if the path contains blank spaces. Try without quotes and let us know if issue still persists.\n\nRefer URL for more info.. I don't think, this is an issue. Same behavior can be seen in notepad (windows default) as well. Moreover, it can be seen in MSWORD as well.\nHowever, this happens only when whole text is continuous. But in real word, I didn't single word/scenario where text is continuous as described in bug.\n\n. I confirm the behavior. It is applicable for all the dockable items such as doc switcher, function list, folder as workspace. etc.\nNotepad++ v7.3.2   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Feb 12 2017 - 23:15:39\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10 (64-bit)\nPlugins : DSpellCheck2.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll PluginManager.dll \n\n. @chcg Actually these colors are being extracted using methods only. But yes, as this piece of code (include two methods) is repeated, it can be moved into single method as well. and I have done it now.\nThank you!. Sending WM_LBUTTONDOWN itself is enough to handle the flickering, but then caret behavior is unpredictable.\nSometimes, caret is set at top while sometime it is set somewhere else. \nTherefore, send WM_LBUTTONDOWN (and obviously WM_LBUTTONDOWN should be released so send WM_LBUTTONUP, other scintilla will consider that user has pressed down, so start selecting text based in mouse move).\nNow we don't know where is the caret, so we must set it to original position. Similar thing is done few lines down.\n``` C++\nif (didDialog)\n        {\n            auto curPos = _pEditView->execute(SCI_GETCURRENTPOS);\n            ::PostMessage(_pEditView->getHSelf(), WM_LBUTTONUP, 0, 0);\n            ::PostMessage(_pEditView->getHSelf(), SCI_SETSEL, curPos, curPos);\n            if (::IsIconic(_pPublicInterface->getHSelf()))\n                ::ShowWindow(_pPublicInterface->getHSelf(), SW_RESTORE);\n        if (doCloseDoc) // buffer has been deleted, cannot (and no need to) go on\n            return;\n    }\n\n```\n. Could not reproduce this issue on Win10 x64 bit. \nIs the issue happening only on Win7 x64? Is there any specific scenario in which this issue occurs?. Even I wondered why \"langs4Npp.nsh\" is considered as binary file. \nI tried to dig into this and found that initial version of \"langs4Npp.nsh\" was checked in as UTF16 (rather UCS-2 LE BOM). \nIt looks like Git treats UTF16 encoded files as binary by default for unknown extension and may not have recognized .nsh extension.\nIn this PR, I've changed file encoding as ANSI also. So next time onward, the diff issue should not occur.. @donho Done!. @donho \nThis PR is really improved version of #2952. It handles additional case of flickering in case doc is deleted which was not taken care in previous PR. Also good code reusability by avoiding code duplication.\nOverall a good PR except few code reformatting which visual studio(2015) does automatically many times within the scope. For example, as soon ending parenthesis (for if, for, switch or even function) is put, VS will reformat the code within the parenthesis. \nPS: Personally I like this PR and want to see it merged.. Steps to reproduce the flickering issue when doc is deleted.\n\nOpen a file in (say a.txt) N++\nNow delete the file from disk. (If you're checking on Win10, then F5 is needed. Because sometimes Win10 does not refresh itself).\nCome to N++, it will ask you to keep/remove the file in/from editor.\nMove mouse pointer on Yes/No button or on any other file menu item. You can observe flickering and changing mouse pointer icon.\n. Adding to above:\nIn existing setup, all the cases except case3 from scenario2 are handled. The purpose of this PR is to handle case3 from scenario2.. Deleting the branch as it will not be merged.. Mostly looks like OS issue. I could reproduce the issue on Win10. Are you using latest builds for both the OS?\n\nPlease try Microsoft link and let us know problem continue to persist.\n. 1. Are you able to open it from start menu? Start->Notepad++->Notepad++\n2. Also are you able to open it by double clicking on \"%allusersprofile%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Notepad++\\Notepad++\". Please paste debug info from Notepad++ -> ? -> Debug Info...\nWill check it tomorrow. Thank you.. @GitMensch I've tried to reproduce this issue. Even after multiple tries on multiple system, I could not reproduce. I feel this is more n less related to OS only.\nFYI, installer just try to execute the lnk (actually shortcut) file kept in %temp% folder which MUST be executed if you're able to execute \"%allusersprofile%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Notepad++\\Notepad++\" manually. . Now, notepad++ launching way has been changed. Please check the latest version (V7.4.1). @GitMensch If this issue does not occur, then please close this issue. Thank you!. @chcg, I feel this ticket can be closed.. >The problem is caused by additional mouse wheel messages landing in the message queue\nCorrect.\n\nbefore the dialog window has been completely initialized and is able to handle messages. \n\nNo, this is not true. To check it, just scroll once and wait for sometime. Now move mouse outside of the TasklistDlg area and start scrolling.\n\nAs a result the main application window creates multiple TaskListDlg's which eventually leads to a stack overflow. \n\nTrue, multiple windows are created. But not because dialog was not completely initialized. Rather it is because of below code in \"nppCommands.cpp\" which is proceed for each mouse scroll.\nC++\n    TaskListDlg tld;\n    HIMAGELIST hImgLst = _docTabIconList.getHandle();\n    tld.init(_pPublicInterface->getHinst(), _pPublicInterface->getHSelf(), hImgLst, direction);\n    tld.doDialog();\n\nThe fix uses a static member variable in TaskListDlg to track the number of instances. This allows the main application window to check the static variable and only create the dialog window if there are no instances.\n\nIt creates regression. Now, you're restricted to scroll only over Tasklist dialog.\nIMO, WM_MOUSEWHEEL message in \"nppBigSwitch.cpp\" should be blocked until we find solution to handle it.\nC++\ncase WM_MOUSEWHEEL:\n{\n    if (0 != (LOWORD(wParam) & MK_RBUTTON))\n    {\n        // redirect to the IDC_PREV_DOC or IDC_NEXT_DOC so that we have the unified process\n        pNppParam->_isTaskListRBUTTONUP_Active = true;\n        short zDelta = (short) HIWORD(wParam);\n        return ::SendMessage(hwnd, WM_COMMAND, zDelta>0?IDC_PREV_DOC:IDC_NEXT_DOC, 0);\n    }\n    return TRUE;\n}\nP.S. I've tried many options, but I could not find good solution to deal with it.. Also some amount of testing is needed.\n1. If Mouse is over Tasklist dialog, then both scrolling down works in reverse way. Scrolling up is not working at all.\n2. When mouse is being scrolled outside Tasklist dialog, then scrolling up/down works in same direction.. Fix is submitted to show OS name properly now. However, it will show only OS name and bit info (32/64 bit).\nAs this info is meant for Notepad++ Dev Team to investigate the issue further. I think there is no point to show build number or flavor such Home/Professional/Enterprise Edition etc.. Deleting branch as PR will not be merged. . oh, updated the comment. Yes, I mean \"will not be merged.\" . I could not reproduce the issue. Please check with latest version.\nIf issue continue to persists, then paste debug info here (from N++ menu -> ? -> Debug Info). @donho , refer the steps to reproduce the issue as below - \nCase 1:\n1. Connect two displays and make higher resolution display as primary display.\n2. Open N++ and move it to secondary display which have comparatively lower resolution.\n3. Open enough number of tabs (say 40~45).\n4. Generate MRU list and see output. It will be same as displayed in previous comment.\nCase 2: Refer the below sceeenshot.\n\n. Somewhat duplicate to #2982, #1616, #2603, #2828, and #607 which has been fixed in PR and will be available in the next release.\nHowever, there are already exit two tab switching methods- \n1. Mouse right click + scroll\n2. ctrl+Tab (ctrl+Shift+tab in reverse way)\nI feel adding another method for same task (e.g. mouse hover tab n then scroll) does not make much sense, but still @donho can take decision on that.. Now, I would say three methods already exist.. How about?\nUTF-8 => UTF-8\nUTF-8 with BOM => UTF-8 + BOM or UTF-8 : BOM or no prefix at all UTF-8 BOM like below \n\n. I confirm, this is really an issue and require attention.. Issue is fixed, please verify the nighty Build. @donho \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open N++ open few tabs (say New1, New 2, New 3, New 4, BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY.txt and New 5\")\n2. Current active doc is New 5\n3. Close New 2, New 3, New 4 (without moving mouse)\n4. Now observe (without moving mouse) BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY.txt, Even mouse is not on \"x\" button but still \"x\" is highlighted. Now, just clicking it will close the document.\nRecording is attached.\n\n. I use Win10 x64 and x86 of npp. The recording was done with the same.\nHowever, it can be reproduced with win7 x64 in my office Dev pc.\nOn Jun 6, 2017 1:07 PM, \"Don HO\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@SinghRajenM https://github.com/singhrajenm Which version of Windows do\nyou use?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/3004#issuecomment-306406752,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOGzJfuSKqkX-CYDrY4vayzPWIYxRns4ks5sBQGpgaJpZM4MWBak\n.\n.

Fixed. @donho PR has been updated. This handles the regression. I will submit another one to handle workspace related issue #3029 . But it works fine for me on my personal machine (win10 x64) with VS2015 (both release and debug). I have checked in my office dev PC win7 x64 using VS2013 for both release/debug (32/64 bit). I didn't see any issue.. Done.. @marcoM32 nsis script should have been updated. So that it can be deployed with installer.. With current setup, npp is launched (from finish dialog) by executing a shortcut created in temp folder. This was done to make npp integrity level same explorer's integrity level, so that drag & drop functionality continues to work.\n\nThis is wired situation that first time pinning works in different way than the second time for same process.\n\nLaunch npp from installer page and pin it to taskbar\nSee its property.\nUnpin it from taskbar and pin it again without restarting npp\nSee its property.\n\n\nThere are few articles (superuser, msdn blog) which show how to pin a program with its command line argument. These articles also talk about the creating shortcut and then pin it to task bar.\nBut the point of interest is: window behaves in different ways for 1st pinning and 2nd pinning or so on for same process. \n1st pinning => includes command line arguments in it.\n2nd pinning => does not includes command line arguments\nI could not figure out why so?. Create PR and close this issue.. @donho Done!. @donho refer the attached PSR to reproduce it. Make sure the npp window size is similar as in screenshot, after that maximization also does not change unless every window is activated once.\nPSR.zip\n. > -Replace  r\\ with &#x0A; for proper new line(s)\nIf so , then \\r\\n should be used as it is standard for windows.

How?\nFor mutli-byte, scintilla API \"SCI_FINDCOLUMN\" returns incorrect position of a column (actually double).\nThen while inserting new column text at wrong location causes the crash.\nI could not find out way (scintilla API to detect the mutli-byte n then use appropriate API to get column position) to handle. Someone who is more aware scintilla APIs can take it forward.\nP.S.\nHowever as per scintilla doc\n\nSCI_FINDCOLUMN(int line, int column) \u2192 int\nThis message returns the position of a column on a line taking the width of tabs into account. It treats a multi-byte character as a single column. Column numbers, like lines start at 0.\n\nbut this is not true in our case.

Refer the attached PSR for details.\nnppCrash.zip\n. @donho \nSubmitted solution does nor work properly. It just avoid the crash but column editor does not work.\nJust take an example using word \"\u671f\u5f85\u3059\u308b\", \n1. put the same word in two lines.\n2. put cursor after first character\n3. Use column editor (space is used).\n4. expected output = first line:\"\u671f \u5f85\u3059\u308b\" and second line:\"\u671f \u5f85\u3059\u308b\", (space after first character)\n5. but actual output = first line:\"\u671f\u5f85\u3059 \u308b\" and second line:\"\u671f\u5f85\u3059 \u308b\", (space after third character.)\nMore over, if the selected column position just greater than the length then character will be always put in the end irrespective of the selected position.\n.

Similar issue #3345 and fix is also submitted #3346. Let's see how it goes.. @donho in original code are multiple return statements which may cause memory leak - \n\n```C++\n    TiXmlDocument *pXmlDocProject = new TiXmlDocument(projectFileName);\n    bool loadOkay = pXmlDocProject->LoadFile();\n    if (!loadOkay)\n        return false;\nTiXmlNode *root = pXmlDocProject->FirstChild(TEXT(\"NotepadPlus\"));\nif (!root) \n    return false;\n\nTiXmlNode *childNode = root->FirstChildElement(TEXT(\"Project\"));\nif (!childNode) \n    return false;\n\nif (!::PathFileExists(projectFileName))\n    return false;\n\n```\nIf something fails and return statement executes, then pXmlDocProject will not be deleted.. @donho changes have been made.. Default size is changed to 2px (use latest version to see effect) which is visible enough. Refer PR #3200. However, configurable setting is a nice idea.. Could not reproduce.\nPlease check this issue after disabling all the plugin. You can disable plugin just by renaming folder \"plugins\" in path \"%programfiles(x86)%\\Notepad++\". It can be re-enable just by undo rename.. Duplicate #2095. Actually, it was already there in older version. I guess, 6.5 or older. It was Dspellchecker which is now available via plugin manager.\nIf I remember correctly, there was an crash reported by MS to Notepad++ owner. This crash occurred due to spell checker. From that time onward, this was removed from Notepad++ installer, but still available via plugin manager. . >Spell checker adds incredible valuable, in my opinion.\nI second it.\nNot sure about checksum, but you can see related issues and discussion at\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/427\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/issues/70\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/9956/dspellcheck-and-windows-10 . Yes, I confirm. It does not work. Statement delete commandLine is culprit in https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/b85930314847727ee8070d1417e674afd1bb24ab.\n@AngryGamer check debug build you will come to know the root cause.\n@donho  you need to review the commit https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/b85930314847727ee8070d1417e674afd1bb24ab.. This is 7-zip's behavior. When you do drag n drop (from archive such as .zip, .rar or any other) notice that a copy of dragged file is created in %temp% and gets deleted quickly.\nTo see this behavior, try to drag n drop on Window's notepad. You will get below error because file get deleted quickly.\n\nN++ is advance, even though the file gets deleted. It gives an another chance to user to keep n save the file somewhere else. :)\n\n. >\"localization\" branch already exist.\nYes, it was created long back, but after merge it was deleted as well. So ideally it should not give any issue rather it should popup error while creating branch or creating PR, shouldn't it?\n\nPlease recreate a new branch for each PR next time.\n\nCreated new one #3605. Now started adding timestamp in the branch name to avoid name conflict.. Correct. But the point is: there is no use of showing this dialog as you\nwill end up with opening file again either with npp or widows notepad (in\nmost of the cases).\nSo better enable this option only when associated program is available.\nConsider using AssocQueryString API to check association.\nEdited:\nAlso don't enable if the default program is set npp.. We are using \nC++\nhres = AssocQueryString(ASSOCF_VERIFY|ASSOCF_INIT_IGNOREUNKNOWN, ASSOCSTR_EXECUTABLE, ext, NULL, NULL, &bufferLen);\ninstead of \nC++\nhres = AssocQueryString(NULL, ASSOCSTR_COMMAND, ext, NULL, buffer, &bufferLen);\nin our commercial products and have not faced any issue so far. In our case, we are not interested in app name, so we are passing NULL.\n\nThis is not perfect because one does not know the syntax in the next Windows, and the Exe of Notepad ++ could change name\n\nIf worried more, then consider using the return code of ShellExecute. If return code<=32, then show error message to user similar to commit 7f98067c128a0fb00f3714c661c\n. Modification done as per review comments.\nAdditionally:\nFrom\nC++\nINT getActiveTb();\nINT  hideToolbar(tTbData* pTbData, BOOL hideClient = TRUE);\nINT  removeTab(tTbData* pTbData)\nTo\nC++\nint getActiveTb();\nint hideToolbar(tTbData* pTbData, BOOL hideClient = TRUE);\nint removeTab(tTbData* pTbData). @donho, I've already updated the PR.

I didn't notice path.. @Yaron10 ,\nAs you already know the root cause and solution too, why don't you create a PR for this?. >Could you please submit this one?\nSure, I will do it.\n\nAnd may I seize the opportunity and refer you to an old forgotten issue? :) :)\n\nOh sorry, I completely forgot this one. I will check it soon.. > MSI setups are intelligent and not that stupid like NSIS.\nWho told you that NSIS setups are stupid? In NSIS, there are ways to control the file before replacing it and I would say it is beauty of NSIS. It is controlled using SetOverwrite flag. Refer nsis doc.\nI feel there might be similar way with msi package as well. if not then I would say MSI is stupid.. Related Bug #3680 . Fix #3677 has been already submitted.. Does it not work for you?\n\n. > It doesn't matter while it's in compiling time but not in run time.\n@donho \nNo, this warning matters in run time as well. Side effects are explained in PR #3371..

New plugin manager is about to release may be in 7.6.. Ideally you should get below screen (1) when you double click installer setup.exe\n\n\n\n\n\nand the screen shared by you is 3rd step of installer.. I could not reproduce. It works well. It might caused by a plugin. Try to without plugin. If still happening, paste debug info here.. So, the crash was caused by plugin. So it is better to close the issue here and log it in respective plugin repository.. Oops!!! my bad. I read crash always as **crach away**.\nAnyway I think, I figured out the root cause. The crash is triggered by lexer dll. Refer the below screenshot for details.\nAs lexer dll is rarely changed, I leave this issue open for @donho . \n\n. Could not reproduce. Check it again without plugins. you can just rename plugins folder (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\plugins) and check.\nLater you can rename it again as \"plugins\".. @movedoa looks like this is no longer an issue in latest version.. Adding one more issue to above list:\n4. npp installation shows below error:\nRoot cause:  ${MementoSection} \"Context Menu Entry\" explorerContextMenu gets executed before notepad++.exe gets copied to InstallDir. While in nppShell.dll method RegisterServer() check for existence of \"notepad++.exe\".\nif (!CheckNpp(szDefaultPath)) {\n        MsgBoxError(TEXT(\"To register the Notepad++ shell extension properly,\\r\\nplace NppShell.dll in the same directory as the Notepad++ executable.\"));\n        //return FALSE;\n    }\nSo when statement Exec 'regsvr32 /s \"$INSTDIR\\NppShell_06.dll\"' gets executed error occurs.\n\n. @donho \nNew PR #4024 has been created.. God knows why it got closed automatically while resolving conflict. . May be. I executed below commands.\ngit reset --hard origin/master\ngit commit -a\ngit push --force nppSingh nsis_DspellCheck_20171130\nAfter that It has gone. Anyway, this is already fixed by @donho in except point 2.. Issue has been fixed in PR #3942 . Let's wait to get this PR merged.. Workaround will work only for shell extension. Themes and localizations can't be added anymore with latest version.. Could not reproduce, I tried with both \"Foxit reader print PDF printer\" and \"Microsoft Print to PDF\" queues. No issue, pdf has been created successfully.. Could not reproduce with Notepad++ v7.5.9   (32-bit).\n. @dail8859 , I took base from your PR. There is no issue in your PR except \"actionscript.xml\" (only one keywod). I parsed full directory and found only VB was left in your PR.. Good one, merge my change with your PR as your PR already includes many other files. I will close it once you done.. closing as changes have been accommodated in PR #3976.. Oops!! That me who caused this issue. Even after thoroughly testing, this couldn't be caught.\nHowever, I feel to avoid further confusion, updating encoding definition value in \"menuCmdID.h\" would be good deal (as commented items are no longer used.). \nUpdating something like below - \nfrom\n#define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_9        (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 17)\n    //#define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_10     (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 18)\n    //#define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_11     (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 19)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_13       (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 20)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_14       (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 21)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_15       (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 22)\n    //#define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_16     (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 23)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_DOS_437           (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 24)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_DOS_720           (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 25)\nto\n#define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_9        (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 17)\n    //#define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_10     (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 18)\n    //#define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_11     (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 19)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_13       (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 18)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_14       (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 19)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_15       (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 20)\n    //#define    IDM_FORMAT_ISO_8859_16     (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 23)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_DOS_437           (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 21)\n    #define    IDM_FORMAT_DOS_720           (IDM_FORMAT_ENCODE + 22). @sasumner As of now there are two solutions\n1. Check for the presence of the file (e.g. PathFileExists). In this case, filename will contains on tab name (e.g. \"New 1\" or may be \"Dollar\" now ), so that PathFileExists will return false for that. Recommended way.\n2. Of-course as you suggested, check for absence of backslash.\nOne question to you:\n\nI have many prewritten scripts that check a filename of \"new(space)(number\"\n\nWhat if a tab name as \"New 1\", but saved on \"C:\\User\\xyz\\Destop\\New 1.txt\", how prewritten script works? I feel, those scripts should check for file presence instead of checking some pattern e.g. \"new(space)(number\". @donho we are ok to close this issue.. I tried with with attached xml, I could not reproduce. However, I noticed slight delay in opening if \"fold all\" is performed in previous instance (even without any plugin). . I could not reproduce. Issue may occur in something plugin.\nProvide debug info. If you are not able to open notepad++ anymore, delete %appdata%/Notepad++/session.xml, then you must to able to open notepad++.. Updating danish.xml does not effectively applied. Follow below steps.\n1. First modify the danish.xml.\n2. Now change language to English or any other (Settings->preferences->General->Localization).\n3. Restart notepad++ and now change language again to Danish.\nOr \nyou can directly copy updated danish.xml to \"%appdata/Notepad++\" and rename it to \"nativeLang.xml\".\nHope this will help you.. Could not reproduce. \n1. Please try uninstall and then install again \n2. or just move file \"%appdata\\Notepad++\\stylers.xml\" temporary (keep backup if you have ever customized it) and just run the notepad++ installer again.\nAlso share the content of javascript if problem continue to persist.\n\n. Correct, you are right. In case of upgrade lexer xml is not upgraded. But in fresh installation it is copied from installed directory.\nI'm not sure why this behavior exists. One possible reason, I can think of is: If a user has customized this styler.xml, then on upgrade he/she will lost the customization if upgrade replaces this file.. Json.hpp supports many new features (C++11 and C++14) and few of them are not supported in VS2013. Now you need VS2015 or VS2017 to compile Notepad++.\n. > Ouch, haven't noticed your pull request before submitting #4077... not sure what to do now\nNo problem. I feel it is ok to keep the both PR active and let @donho decide which/how to merge. Because, this PR just handle the UI updation, while PR #4077 deals with actual encoding in certain scenarios.. Reproduce steps really helped to analyze this issue.\nRoot Cause:\nWhen language is changed, npp creates a copy of desired language as (nativeLang.xml) in %appdata%/Notepad++ and use it further reflect same on the UI immediately. As there was error in translated string xml (English.xml), it causes this issue.\nWhy issue does not occur in English when npp is restarted?\nnpp does not load nativeLang.xml when English is your preferred language. It just uses strings directly from binary itself.. @donho No, I just tried without PCRE support and it worked fine. Now, I downloaded boost1.55 and it looks like VS2105 is not supported for Boost1.55. So let's drop idea to update readme. We can update it later when we move to latest scintilla.. Created sample app and added Add \"%s\" to Dictionary in stringtable using built-in resource editor. Microsoft adds\n\"Add \"\"%s\"\" to Dictionary1\" in rc file. However changing as \"Add \\\"\"%s\\\"\" to Dictionary\" also works fine as it is working in DSpellCheck. But this rc is generated using ResEdit which might have saved using escape character.\n  . Closing.. @JAT86  you can use CTRL + SHIFT + MOUSEWHEEL on tabs. It will switch to first and tab.\n\n\n. > So there's no way to uninstall the spell checking\nOption is given at the time of installation. You can uncheck DSpellCheck during installation, then it will not be installed.. >Okay, so how can I uninstall it? Running the installer again and deselect the option doesn't help. What file do I have to delete?\n@ygoe , PR has been submitted which will work exactly as you stated (Running the installer again and deselect the option). Let's hope it will get merged.. Please provide debug info (From menu -> ? -> Debug Info)\n. @Ynhockey Do you know which version you were using earlier? I mean when it asked for update.. @ZeroCool940711 \nAs this issue is consistently appearing for you. Could you please attached screenshot of task manager like below?\nPlease note: If you are not able to see the command line column, you can right click on \"Name\" or \"PID\" or any column header then click on \"select columns\" and choose \"Command Line\".\n\n. This is similar to #4112. Just to cover all other scenarios (Specially case 2 and 3), created this issue. Also, it does not limit to \"Macro\" menu, but cover all the menu items.. > But how come the following command makes a mess to the other commands?\nenableCommand(IDM_MACRO_SAVECURRENTMACRO, !_macro.empty() && !_recordingMacro, MENU | TOOLBAR);\nThis is just to disable the \"Save Current Recorded Macro\" menu. Because there is no point in keeping this button enabled once macro is saved. Now it controlled with two flags (1. Any macro recorded? and 2. is recorded macro saved?).\nWhile other commands are handled by below change -\ncmdFlags = MF_BYCOMMAND | ((cmdFlags&MF_CHECKED) ? MF_CHECKED : MF_UNCHECKED) | ((cmdFlags&MF_DISABLED) ? MF_DISABLED : MF_ENABLED);. > It is very likely it is a false positive.\nLooks like false alarm only, if the installer (32bit or 64 bit) is downloaded from official site. File C:\\My Program Files\\Notepad++\\uninstall.exe is auto generated by installer which seams very less likely virus infected.. You can enable to autosave/backup in npp. Refer below screenshot.\n\nThe problem is I forget to save some documents and when I close out I have like 50 New documents that I have to name and save.\n\nNo worry, all the new documents are saved into the backup folder with timestamp (e.g. new 1@2018-01-08_175541). You can close notepad++ without any issue and whenever you open it again you will find all the new documents in same state.\nIf you close tab instead of npp, then of course it will ask to you save otherwise no way to read human brain whether he wanted to really close the doc or not or wanted to autosave somewhere.\n\nAnother thing if you open 2 docs. One will be called new 1 and the other new 2. However if you close them and open another one it should be called new 3, however its just called new 1.\n\n\nIf both the tabs are not empty then at the time of closing tabs(of course one by one closing). It must ask you to save or not. Choice is yours. If you close the tab with save option, then the doc is not no longer unsaved and if you close the tab without save, then unsaved document is no longer valid. So there is no point in keeping temporary names new1 and new2 reserved.\nIf both the documents are empty, then after closing them opening new document as new 1 make sense.\nIf documents are empty, then reopening n++ will give only new 1. Because keeping multiple empty unsaved documents does not make any sense.\nIf documents are not empty, then reopening n++ will retain the old two documents and new document will be new 3.\n\n\n. Adding one more scenario:\nSteps to Reproduce the Issue\n\nOpen multiple files in NPP, resulting in multiple tabs.\nExternally delete a file.\nClick on some random NPP tab when NPP doesn't have focus (it doesn't seem to matter which tab) .\nAcknowledge the \"Keep non existing file\" dialog (irrespective of \"Yes\" or \"No\").\nMove the mouse pointer over NPP tabs.\n. Initial RCA:\nAt step 3, when user clicks on tab WM_LBUTTONDOWN message is sent, but WM_LBUTTONUP is not received. Then WM_MOUSEMOVE further does its task. More depth debugging/analysis is needed to investigate further.\n\n\n. Invalid Test case because of two reasons - \n1. x86 installation should go to \"%programfiles(x86)%/Notepad++\" while x64 should go to \"%programfiles%/Notepad++\". \n\nIf you try to install 64bit npp over 32 bit npp, it will provide popup like below. If you click \"Yes\", then 32bit version will be removed and x64 will be installed. However there was an issue in V7.5.1 which was fixed in V7.5.2. Refer changelog point 4\n\n\n. This is windows behavior. Low integrity processes (in this case explorer runs with low integrity), are not allowed for drag n drop with higher integrity processes (in this case N++).\nHowever, some tweaks (may be loopholes) allow to do so. Moreover, item 0x0049 is undocumented.\nBut in case of N++, it is bit tough. It has been tried out in PR #2683, but could not succeed. It would be great if you provide the fix in PR.. Improved it as suggested by @bladeoflight16.. >This hasn't been merged yet? \nNo, it is not merged yet.\n\nWhy not?\n\nOnly @donho knows. \ud83d\ude09 . @donho It is already updated as per latest translation.. @gitmeister is this issue similar to issue  #2010 , #1018, #1761? However, these issues were fixed sometime ago in PR #2952, but there might be some corner case. Please provide exact steps to reproduce.. @donho \nI have created new PR #4291 which removes duplicate entry from the english.xml and also syn english_customizable.xml with english.xml.\nHowever, I have updated this PR as well if PR #4291 does sounds good to you.. On Windows 10\nCase 1 works perfectly for me.\nIn case 2, the file is updated as soon ping command exits (Ctrl+C). This also seems to be fine. Because even in directory (where monitoring file is kept), file status info is not changed unless cmd releases the file. Once ctrl+C is pressed, both in npp and in windows explorer file is updated.\nDebug Info:\nNotepad++ v7.5.5   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Feb 27 2018 - 21:44:21\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10 (64-bit)\nPlugins : DSpellCheck.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll \n.

I am just trying to understand what is expected here. \nAs soon you leave Ctrl, it will just open the file which was highlighted in MRU list.\nIf you don't like this behavior, you can disable complete doc switcher feature (refer previous screenshot). After disabling if you use Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+Shift+Tab, then it will change the tab (forward and backward).\nIf you don't like this also, you have an another option. Just hold the Ctrl key and scroll the mouse (both up and down) on tabs.\nIn both the above cases you can see tab switching is happening. Could you explain more what else is expected?.

Not only this, but there are around 60 PRs (mine are 8~10) PRs are ready to merge, but still pending. Many of PRs got reject because of the amount of code change stating more code changes are prone to error/regression. This kind of attitude in software industry is not good at all. People's effort should be valued. \n@chcg asked me to look into file association issue #4595 . I was knowing these issues and fix for those already, but just to avoid wastage of time, I didn't paid much attention. But when @chcg asked, I look on those issues again and submitted the PR. But what after that? No response, no feedback, I would say not even reviewed.\nI remember the case of @Rikk and why he left this community.\nIf we look at the bug tracker, as on today (06, dec, 2018) there are 2400 bugs reported. If we exclude duplicate or invalid cases , still around 1500 bugs can be seen which is not a good sign for a popular software. Instead of providing less valued features (e.g. doc peeker while we already have document map in place, Tools->MD5 etc.), some time should be spent to clear bug list as well. I'm not against new features, but meanwhile bug-fixes and enhancement also should be considered.\nThe only motivation have is: I would like to improve the software which I use daily basis and I love to code.. @chcg just for your reference, #4595 is from windows side (I think starting from 1803). But other defects referenced in that defect (and many reported on community) are handled in #5000. This PR deals around 6~7 issues (may be more) from tracker and hot topic on community as well. So don't you think it is also users needs/problems.\nSo concern is not this PR. The actual concern is something else. For example, as @sasumner pointed, what is wrong with this PR? If you don't like it does not mean that other will not like. Others will like if it really makes a difference. Similarly plugin admin design is another thing which currently people are discussing a lot.\nMoral of story: BOSS is not always \u27a1\ufe0f. Sometimes he takes \u2b05\ufe0f and tries to defend that it is \u27a1\ufe0f. Unfortunately, everyone is trying to become BOSS.. I'm away and don't have access to my dev pc. I can check once I come back.\nOn Wed, 19 Dec 2018, 10:54 am Rathod Roshan <notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@SinghRajenM https://github.com/SinghRajenM Hello Sir, Would you please\ncheck this?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/5152#issuecomment-448473505,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOGzJZvvaghdysda3RLU78bvnVK3BmaDks5u6c2LgaJpZM4ZYL-K\n.\n. @Predelnik\nThis crash is due to DSpellCheck.dll and seen with DSpellCheck V1.4.8 which can't be seen with V1.4.9.\n\n@supermingwu , could you update DSpellCheck version and check whether issue exists or not.. > \n\ncompletely off topic and triggered by a thumbs up:\n@sasumner we still miss you.\nif your first thought is, that 4 years+ of exhaustless, patient and productive support is enough, and it's time to move on, thinking many (but by far not all) things you've taught have already been assimilated by other readers, you're right ...\n... but nevertheless, even if you decided you don't want to read or answer any more questions, i think you can imagine what it would mean, once a year or so, to hear a comment or hello from teacher to alumni, regardless if it's sarcastic or not \ud83d\ude09\n\nVery surprising... Still not able to understand, why. \ud83e\udd14 . @chcg, I feel none of them addresses this issue. Moreover, this issue neither with installer nor with npp. This issue is with nppshell.dll. Ideally, nppshell.dll should be designed in such a way that on uninstall, dll must be freed from explorer context. So that it can be deleted.\nI think, this issue should not occur if system is restarted. If issue occurs on restart, then #4772 is the fix for this issue too as nppshell.dll will be deleted on restart.. @donho may be you tried with VS2015 toolset. As I can see this error in both VS2017 and VS2019 Preview. Try to change the toolset and see the magic. \ud83d\ude1c \n\n\n. @donho  please look into this again as I need to modify Parameters.cpp all the time whenever I take latest from main trunk. This is little tedious process.\nI don't have VS2015 installed (and don't want too as VS2019 is on the way) so I build npp using vs2017 with its toolset which always reports this error.\n@jstine35 \n\nAnother option to fix this compile error is to disable the warning\n\nI feel this is not a good idea. For example unused variable warning (warning C4189: 'a': local variable is initialized but not referenced) is also treated as error which is good and we should removed used items.. @donho Review comments have been accommodated and conflict has been resolved.. @donho , no there is no bug reported for it. I found it myself. Do you want a defect to be logged?. Continue to @sasumner ,\n\"open containing folder\" take you to \"My PC\" or \"My Computer\" while\n\"Open Containing Folder in CMD\" takes you to Notepad++ installation path.\nAdditionally, Options at \"File->Open Containing Folder->Explorer\" and \"File->Open Containing Folder->Cmd\" are grayed out which are expected. And these items on context menu of tab are not synced under \"File\" menu's items.. One line fix is clear and efficient only in look @donho. It does not solve the problem. Did you really test your change?\n\n. > Did you really test your change?\nI'm asking because I did the same thing. But in testing found, that it is not proper. That's why my one line fix got converted to 3~4 line automatically. \ud83d\ude0a . > Interesting! So did the bug exist before the replacement of lstrcpy to wcscpy_s ?\nNo, it was working fine earlier.. @donho done!. What do you mean by vertical split?\nDo you mean \"Settings->Preferences->Edit->Show Vertical Edge\", then I'm not able to reproduce.. > (via Move/Clone to Other View)\nThis way also no crash.  There are no concrete steps given to reproduce, it is better to close the issue.\n@ultrabear \nThat is the reason the bug reporting template is given. Please follow to help community and get help from community. Thank you!. @rddim and @MAPJe71 Done!!!. @donho I have resolved the conflict.. @donho \nAs \"rename unsaved tab\" feature will be available from next release, we need to make backup of renamed unsaved tab is also maintained.\nCurrent implementation doesn't restrict user from entering reserved keys (such as < > : \\ /  | ? * etc). If user enters one of these characters for file name, then backup will not be created.\nSo before we start getting complains, please look into this PR.. I feel it should be \n \"0 match.\", \"1 match.\", \"2 matches\", \"3 matches\" and so on.......\n\n\"1 match.\", \"2 matches\", \"3 matches\" and so on.......\n\n\n\nare already there.\n\n\"0 match.\"\n\nWhy not this then. \nOTOH why not \"1 matches\"?\n. Very funny!!! I have updated the description now. \ud83d\ude0e . @vlakoff In which update scenario autoCompletion directory will  be empty? As of now, I could not think about it.\nSay if user already has all/few autocomplete APIs installed and user unchecks all of those autoCompletion APIs during update, there is no provision to remove already installed APIs as of now. So autoCompletion directory will not empty. So I can't think in which scenarios this PR is applicable.\n@donho \n\nSay if user already has all/few autocomplete APIs installed and user unchecks all of those autoCompletion APIs during update, there is no provision to remove already installed APIs as of now.\n\nThis is a bug. During update/reinstall, installer should provide option to remove already installed plugin/themes/autocomplete etc. I have submitted PR  #4704 to handle this scenario (only for plugins as of now). If it sounds good, will be enhanced for other options too.\n. > The installer put all new files into $INSTDIR\\autoCompletion, and removed the corresponding files from $INSTDIR\\plugins\\APIs. As a result the latter got entirely emptied.\nIn this case, user knows what s/he is going to do. I was expecting this may come as answer. \ud83d\ude1c \nMoreover, this is not correct/usual approach. User may remove directory, but as you know autocomplete writes memento registry as well (Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Notepad++), who is going to remove those then?\nSo instead of removing them manually. Reinstall/update should allow user to remove already installed components.. If the intention is only to remove empty autoCompletion directory on update, then this line is the best candidate for statement RMDir \"$installPath\\autoCompletion\\\".\n\nIf ever the user has customized a file on its own, he should be aware the installer replaces the content of \"%ProgramFiles%\\Notepad++\".\n\nNo, this is not true in all the cases. In case of autoComplete, files are not replaced because of this.\nAbove sample code will install api.xml if user checks respective checkbox and if user unchecks, then existing api.xml will be removed. But still autoCompletion directory will not be removed. Moreover, there should be generic/common function which will do the same thing for all the api.xml files instead of having separate code for each api.xml file.. Again could not reproduce. \nWill you trying after disabling all the plugins?. Fixes:\n1116\n2082\nNo longer valid:\n4180. @sasumner No. No change till now.\nAs per @LordNyriox \neither remove \"the\" from \"Enable for all ~~the~~ tabs\" \nor add \"the\" in \"Enable only for the current tab\".. > IMO the best thing would be to drop \"the\" in both.\nDone now.\n\nCan you please merge #5273 in this PR (a simple 5 lines change) as it's totally ignored so far by the maintainer.\n\n@wqweto It is better to keep #5273 separate to adhere Contributing Policy. Also as I can @donho  has assigned #5273 to himself. Once he will get time, he will review and take action. I would say, don't worry, it is not ignored, just taking time.\n. @donho \nPlease find the description as below - \n1. If new checkbox is not checked, then old behavior is retained. No change at all. It will help those users who want to detect changes for all the opened files. So it is retained as it is.\n2. If new checkbox is checked, then\n     a. If file change will be detected only for active tab. So user will see only one messagebox for reload. If file other than active tab is modified, then user will be see reload message only when s/he activates that particular tab.\n    b. Other two options are same as they were working before for all the tab (but now will work for current tab too.). Like if user check \"update silently\", then the active will be updated silently without showing messagebox. Same for \"Go to end\" and combination of both.\nFrom UI perspective:\n1. \"Update silently\" and \"Scroll to the end after update\" will be enabled only if either one of options (Enable for all tabs or Enable for current tab) is selected.\n2. At a given time, user can choose \"Enable for all tabs\" or \"Enable for current tab\" or None of them.. @donho Updated the PR as per review comments.. @bahusoid \n\nPlease confirm that Save All operation does nothing for unchanged tabs, so it's safe to click it even if some tabs were changed externally.\n\nYes, save all will not impact unchanged tab as well as externally modified file.\n\nAnd what about \"Replace All in All Opened Documents\" operation?\n\nThis is behavioral decision here. \nIf only file changes detection is enabled, \"Replace All in All Opened Documents\" or \"File all in All opened Doc\" will be performed on current state of all the tab. That means if something is externally modified will not be considered. But, if \"Update silently\" is also enabled then externally modified changes will be considered during \"Replace All in All Opened Documents\" and \"File all in All opened Doc\" operations. So it is all user's choice.. @donho \n\n@SinghRajenM What @bahusoid pointed out is an expected behaviour but hard to implement.\n\nI think I found the solution for this issue as well. Likely one line solution \ud83d\ude1c \n``` \nbool Notepad_plus::replaceInOpenedFiles() {\n......\n.....\nif (pBuf->isReadOnly())\n                continue;\n//These two line are newly added\n            if(!pBuf->isDirty())\n                pBuf->checkFileState();\n```\nSay there are 5 tabs opened.\nTab 1: Saved\nTab 2: Externally modified\nTab 3: Externally modified\nTab 4: A dirty tab (may be saved, but dirty)\nTab 5: A saved dirty tab, but it is modified outside as well.\nCurrently, I'm on Tab 1. I do replace all in opened tab.\nResult:\nTab 1: replacement will happen without any issue.\nTab 2: It will ask for confirmation to reload\n     a) if user says yes to reload, then file will be reloaded and then replacement will happen.\n     b) if user says no to reload, then replacement will happen for old data\nTab 3: Unless user come out of tab 2, it will be waiting for its turn. Once tab 2 operation is complete, replacement will happen for this tab as per 2.a and 2.b\nTab 4: After tab 3, replacement will happen on this tab directly.\nTab 5: After tab 4, replacement will happen for this tab as well but with old data.\nPlease note: User can do Ctrl + z for all the 5 tabs.\nI feel this is expected. I feel this can be applied to find operation as well. I will check in sometime today.\n. @donho I suspect commit 011aa960fb2400526c61299d8df89876be329cec caused this issue. specially removing of below snippet in file NppIO.cpp. \n```C++\n  size_t res = gs_fileName.find_first_of(UNTITLED_STR);\nif (res != string::npos && res == 0) // it can happen when a document named \"new #\", which is dragged from another instance, is dropped into this instance\n{\n    // it's meaningless to show empty \"new #\" document, so just return null\n    return nullptr;\n}\n\n```\nNow please note, we can't rely only on UNTITLED_STR as unsaved tab may contains any name (because of rename tab feature). So we need to figure out the alternative. Hope this will help.. @EvilGrinUK give a try as uninstall.exe /S. Note: flag /S is capital. And provide debug info from \"menu->?->Debug Info...\".. @EvilGrinUK sorry, I could not reproduce.\n\n. @Yaron10 This seems to be very special case. I can reproduce this issue in 7.6.1 as well.\nSteps to reproduce in v7.6.1:\n1. Open \"New 1\" and type asasasa\n2. Open \"New 2\" and type as as as\n3. Open a saved file.\n4. Now switch to \"New 1\" and perform \"find all in current document' for a\n5. Switch to 3rd tab which is saved file\n6. Now click on search result\nResult is after step 6: it highlights on 3rd tab instead of switching to 1st tab.. Further more, it comes only when tab Name is \"New 1\" (as per my test results)..

If you are talking about existing macro APPVERSION, it can't be used directly as VIProductVersion expect version string X.X.X.X. We have to write many conditions to utilize APPVERSION. \nReason is:\nIn V7 APPVERSION = 7\nIn V6.9.2 APPVERSION = 6.9.2\nIn V6.9 APPVERSION = 6.9\n. However, I was thinking why can't we remove macro APPVERSION (VERSION_MAJOR and VERSION_MINOR as well). Instead of changing its value for every release, just read the version info from notepad++.exe and use it.\nThis requires an additional nsis file (get version of npp exe and write version info in normal text file in form of macro with required format.) and its output (exe) file.\nLater include call this exe in beginning of nsi script to generate text file and use these defined macro from the text file.\nWe have used this approach in many project. This will reduce the manual effort of writing version info everytime.\n. @MAPJe71 Initially, I though to utilizing existing macros, but when I saw the history of these macros, I could not use these without writing conditions as the value. Consider V6.9.2, then major is 6, minor is 92. So break 92 as 9.2 and append .0 (6.9.2.0) while in V7 major is 7, minor is 0, so append .0.0 (so 7.0.0.0).\n. Now, version info can be read from npp.exe itself. No need to update this file for every release (at-least for version change).\n. Two values $ R0 and $ R1 which will be extracted from npp.exe. \n. I don't think commented code creates confusion. If it really bothers people I'll remove commented code.\n. There is no assumption.  These all are  facts from the previous releases\nIn V7 APPVERSION = 7 major=7 minor=0\nIn V6.9.2 APPVERSION = 6.9.2 major=6 minor=92\nIn V6.9 APPVERSION = 6.9 major=6 minor=9\n. I use these register variables because\n: No declaration needed (var blah).\n: Less LOC\n: No name conflict (not applicable here very less code)\n: Bit faster than normal variable\n. I think below screenshot will answer your queries.\n\n. I was trying different options and commented code was one of them. Instead removing, I just commented. Nothing more than that.\n. No. They are not same. Refer the screenshot (attached above) of actual notepad++.exe. You will find the difference.\nI think that make sense.\n. This is way most of the nsis scripts are written. I feel these were introduce to simplify the task, otherwise there was no need to introduce registers $0~$9 and $R0~$R9.\n. No...no\nSay npp.exe version 6.9.2.0, then \n$R0 = 6.9 $R1=2.0\nBelow link you give you more insight\nhttp://nsis.sourceforge.net/GetDllVersion_Command_Explained\n\nFrom URL\nAbout numbers GetDllVersion.

Instead calling CreateDirectory for each folder which may already exist (till ....\\Roaming\\Notepad++),\nSHCreateDirectory can be used on fullpath.

These APIs work fine for win8 and Win10.\n. accelerator key is already assigned. This may be cause for regression #2595 . Right, it it not required in our case.\nBut it is always to good to reset the variable (or handle both Yes and No case) in a function which is meant to set/reset based on user interaction. Such a kind of functions can be called multiple times, so it is MUST to reset the value otherwise the variable may carry previous value if user clicks \"No\". \n\nIn our case also the function is called twice (but in the flow it will be called only once). Let me know if you want me to remove it.. Why new style dialog is applicable only for vista and higher version?\nAs per MSDN , minimum version of Shell dll should be 5.0 and 6.0 for BIF_USENEWUI  and BIF_NONEWFOLDERBUTTON respectively. So I think XP also should be covered.\n\n. Variable is declared here because full file path is copied into it in the next if block.\nSo one way to do so is moving the complete if block just before closing the file [step: bool isBufRemoved = removeBufferFromView(id, whichOne);], because after it we may not get file name as buffer will be removed from view. But still it will be far from the actual use of variable.\nIntentionally, I didn't do as code review become easier. Let me know if it is ok to move the complete if block.. It should be not be an issue as variable is declared with empty string. Let me know if it really needs to be changed.. How about MB_ICONINFORMATION?\n\nwhile only MB_OK looks as\n\n. Done!.

Though above solution works proper in my win10 pc, but I'm not sure if this works in all the versions of windows.\n\n\n\nExecWait does not know whether npp is launched or not. If npp takes sometime to initialize itself (may be in first installation or in slower system). The original problem may continue to persist if npp is get launched because of second line Exec '\"$INSTDIR\\notepad++.exe\" \"$INSTDIR\\change.log\" '. @dail8859 as per documentation isdigit behavior is undefined if the value of ch is not representable as unsigned char and is not equal to EOF.\n\nSo in case of Asian languages this statement throws assert failure (Though it is irrelevant for release version).\nIs there any issue if this is replaced with\nC++\nreturn str.find_first_not_of(\"0123456789\") == std::string::npos;. _tcstol for each character (because string may be large enough to convert into max possible integer) might an alternative.

If this parameter is seen, then launch npp as non elevated process. This can be achieved by grabbing access token from desktop shell, then duplicate this token and create new npp process using this token. UAC plugin internally does the same.. writting? Isn't \"writing\" proper? Even I can see spellchecker on GitHub shows \"writing\".. Somewhere DeleteObject should be called, shouldn't?. It does not use VS2017 compiler. Shouldn't be v141_xp?.

This is not proper assignment operator overloading. It should perform deep copy and should return *this. \nPrevious code (assignment operator overloading) does nothing. So instead of doing nothing, it should not be permitted at all.\nThere two ways to do it. 1-> put = overloading in private section (similar to singleton class). 2,-> Modern C++ offers another way mark it as deleted (which is far better as compiler produces error when it sees the usage of = in the code. Refer msdn.).. shortcuts[i].getID() is unsigned long instead of unsigned int.

Then it may be a good time to call it 7.0.0 :)\n. So um, 2% size reduction on one executable (0% for the whole distribution) in exchange for stability? What kind of sense does that make to you, mate?. -1 I can't see how porting ALL plugins AND Notepad++ to UWP is simpler than porting just the plugins to 64 bit. In most cases it should be trivial to patch anyway (unlike a Win32 to UWP conversion which is basically a rewrite).. Neat, there's already 7 \"development\" plugins available. Is there any good reason this isn't included in the Npp releases yet?. Oh I see: https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/issues/7\nIs this the blocker for my issue?. Oh, I didn't realize those 6 releases occurred in the last 2 months :) Then fingers crossed this will soon make its way into npp.. Ouch :). This is an issue, since you get the UAC prompt even when running in portable and thus you have write access to the folder as a user.\nThis whole plugin mess is a friggin' disaster. It's no longer possible to mass-deploy Notepad++ at all. The moment you push it out, all your users lose ALL their plugins and have to reinstall them all. Assuming they're admins, since this only works with admin rights due to the erroneous UAC prompt.\nYour selection of 3rd party plugins is a configuration element, not an installation element. So why the hell would you put them in the install folder. How the hell does this improve security? Particularly stupid given that plugins can still put binaries in your AppData folder, like 3P. So what kind of problem does this solve? Practically none. Oh, but an audit program said you have to eliminate this option, so let's just do that without putting any thought into it.\nIf several users use the same computer, if you install a 3rd party plugin, it'll appear to all. Even if they don't want it. Then they can remove it.... and then all users will lose it.\nThe whole mess looks like someone from the 90s designed it (or rather, didn't design it at all), where you had only one user on the host, and she was always an admin. So yeah, nice going with these new releases. First they broke it with the installer installing stock plugins into ONE user's AppData (so other users wouldn't have the stock plugins, only the one installing Npp), then they managed to make it even worse with this stupid crap of putting everything into the install dir. That's quite an achievement.\nIt's like one user installs AdBlock for Firefox, and it asks for admin consent. And it installs it for all users, too. And if another user removes it, it's gone for everyone. Does that sound reasonable to you? It's not an issue, right? Windows 95 at its finest.\nIt's so stupid it's beyond belief. For now we stick with 7.5.9 and will probably switch to something else when 7.5.9 stops working for whatever reason.. ",

Otherwise other plugins, cannot be notified for such changes until Npp is restarted. I actually have a request for exactly this \"feature\" for one of my plugins we are using at work.\n. I meant, it would be very useful to have a notification when the user changes a shortcut. If my understanding is correct, currently the shortcut.xml file only changes upon exiting Notepad++, and plugin developers have no means to actually \"ask\" about the current configuration other than reading the shortcuts.xml file.\nThe comment was actually going to @donho .\n. @cmeriaux Unfortunately no. The plugin adds support for a DSL, called RText. Among others, the language supports comments. Notepad++ has support for shortcuts which add comments to a single line, or more lines. I can reuse the same shortcuts and implement this feature for my plugin, but if the user changes the shortcuts my plugin won't know, until the editor is restarted, because the shortcut.xml is updated only upon exit of the editor.\n. It would maybe help to know what kind of character are we talking about :)\n. It is definitely feasible. If it is useful, you'll be the judge of that :)\n. Side question : will the forum questions / knowledge be transfered here somehow ? Wiki ? Or somewhere?\n. I second this. There has to be extension specific auto completion options, not global as it is now.\nI am writing a plugin, and it was really hard to override the default auto completion ( which is extremely slow on larger files ), and implement my own.\n. Have you tried using NPPN_BUFFERACTIVATED ? Works fine for me.\n. Heh, I do exactly the same thing in my plugin :).. I guess we need to fix the core of the problem indeed.\n. On the same page, it would also be helpful to have something like\nNPPM_SAVEFILEWITHPATH\nIn my plugin, I need to save all opened files of my dsl, and currently to do this, I have to first switch to every file I need to save. Maybe I'll open up a feature request.\n. Yeah I saw it :) good job!\n. I'll have to agree with @ariccio  and another guy whose name I have forgotten :) who said that we'll need to split the functionality into smaller testable modules. If we were to abstract those modules then with regards to specific OS APIs then our life would of course be simpler. But I think as it stands it would be counter productive to start porting anything to another platform.\nP.S. Regarding testing, are there any tests running here? :)\n. I think this is similar to the bug I mentioned here : https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/173\n. I can confirm this as well with 1000 lines.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/173 I believe.\n. @cmeriaux  Does your fix, also fixes the issue where shortcut.xml is not being updated during runtime?\n. I can actually verify this error, by trying to \"remove\" the Explorer.dll via the plugin manager. Plugin manager hangs indefinitely when the \"Plugin Update\" window is open with message \"Waiting for Notepad++ to close\".\n. At the time of the report, this plugin was bundled with Npp. Therefore I thought it was helpful to post this here. I'll try to find the plugin author..\n. OK, I'll try implementing this and do a pull request :)\n. Please review this and let me know if it can be merged.\n. Pull request now properly done.\n. There are also other problems being looked at regarding sessions right now. e.g. If you close Npp while a file is edited without saving, it correctly reopens as \"not saved\", but then, even if you do save it the dirty flag remains red \"not saved\".\n. @dail8859 Regarding the buffer id, I think it's more intuitive to just pass the file name, but I could change that no problem. Tab vs spaces :) sorry my IDE was adjusted to use spaces. I'll fix this.\n. OK Tabs fixed.\n. @Rikk Thanks :) I guess coding at 2 AM has its drawbacks :dancer: \n. @Rikk I've \"fixed\" the issue and added a comment for clarification.\n. @cmeriaux You mean squash? Or how do I do this ?\n. @Croydon Thanks for the tip.\n. @cmeriaux I think it's too late for that, I've already pushed the changes and @Rikk  has already merged them, except the last one.\n. @cmeriaux OK, I'll try this and then close this pull request and open another one if the commit number is smaller.\n. @cmeriaux Even so, this PR is useful. The shortcuts would then be actual after a notepad++ restart. Currently this is not possible when the user is using cloud settings.\n. Hi, is there any chance that this will be committed in the foreseeable future? :) Without this \"feature\" cloud settings cannot be used from any plugin.\n. Reverted last fix. I will create a new pull request about that. \nBtw - this here is also a bug.\nNPPM_GETPLUGINSCONFIGDIR is giving back wrong results in case cloud settings are active.\n. @donho \nBecause in order for my plugin to correctly format it's text, I have to know it's respective tab settings. Currently this is impossible for plugins since the settings directory cannot be retrieved.. @dail8859 Not really, I want my plugin to integrate flawlessly with Npp. This is not possible because if the user chooses cloud settings, then the settings will not be retrievable. So if we are using cloud settings - for language specific settings e.g. Tabs which is part of the Notepad++ itself and therefore is not saved under the plugins directory, rather the Notepad++ ( user defined ) directory, then this will not work and the plugin will have no way to retrieve the settings.\nWhy should the plugin author have to implement a Tab settings from scratch when this setting already exists per language in the plugin itself?\nIn my opinion you will have to either \"removed\" any and all tab settings for plugins, or allow the plugin to retrieve these settings ( why have a setting when you cannot read it? )\nSure, I could have implemented this in my plugin itself, but since the mechanism is already there, why not reuse it?. In Visual Studio up/down is used to navigate the list. Pressing left/right immediately closes the list.\n. +1\n. Exactly what @cmeriaux said. I have observed this quite a lot of times, when writing text via the various Scintilla messages. It is not easily reproduced, but the bug is there, somewhere. Automated tests would easily reproduce this..\n. Actually there's another bug with search and replace with files. Randomly files are not being \"replaced\".. I'll try to reproduced and post an example. Did the same search and replace with Npp and VS - VS got 66 more results than Npp..\n. Please also consider this https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/862 if you're fixing this cosmetic change :)\n. OK, this means, that somehow with the 3 extensions only the \"last\" one was recognized? That's why it found some results? Otherwise I'd expect nothing to work at all. If this is the case, then feel free to close this ticket.\n. Probably caused by this: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/65717312369588cbe2bfe356e912ae36645d76b3 , plus the fact that no automated tests exist for the code.\n. Agree. This has to be optional. It messes up with my DSL, and with someone's coding style in general.\n. @DarkNexusNR Since we cannot reopen a ticket, I'd suggest you create a new one and link to this one.\n. @DarkNexusNR Ah my bad, it's ok. I saw the Closed of #1012 and mistook it for this one.\n. I think it's the same as this one:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/881\n. I agree, it simple iterates through all files and focus on them. Very annoying when you have opened multiple files. What's needed is a background update, i.e. without having to actually focus on the tab, just like e.g. Visual Studio does it.\n. It's getting confused in random places and files, that was just an example. OK, I'll report this to Scite as well. Note: this effectively breaks folding in any and all languages give a big enough file.. Editing/manipulating the file seems to partially fix this.. but that shouldn't be the case.\n. LOL there are about a million bugs regarding folding already reported there. I wonder why I should bother posting the next one...\n. Posted :  https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/bugs/1780/ let's see when this is fixed there, and when the new scintilla get's integrated here :)\n. @dail8859 reply I got from scintilla bug:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/bugs/1780/\nThe file contains an explicit fold marker //{ which affects the fold structure. Either remove this or turn off explicit fold markers.\nAny idea what to do here?\n. @dail8859  It appears you were correct to identify the problem area, but I do not find any \"turn off explicit fold markers\" option. It this in scintilla? Does NPP use it? Can one set this off for some lexer/extension ?\nThanks\n. Probably a scintilla bug...\n. @dail8859 I could help you with : I don't know of anything in the code to determine if it is the first time a specific version of N++ has been started.\nIt should be relative easy. We can just save this into the registry or somewhere persistent and check that each time Npp starts. If the versions differ - you got it.\n. I can confirm as well.\n. Or just setup the correct enviromental variables by executing vcvars32.bat and use a normal command line.\n. No, the path to the .lib is not correct or the .lib is not generated. Can you see that the file exists at all ?\n. Obvisously you cannot compile with visual studio greater than  --toolset msvc-12.0    for Visual Studio 2013.\nSo I'd suggest to download 2013 version..\n. Maybe you should give it another try.. ? I've followed the instructions and build this myself. It's not sooo complicated. Just don't use VS2015 - isn't supported, yet.\n. I hope this get's merged..\n. I could try building it.. But even then I cannot guarantee it's correctness. Don't forget we are dealing with code here which has 0 tests.\n. Hm, did you try a release version? I'll try it myself then with the source.\nYeah, that's what I have been trying however in my case I had both views open - don't know if his plays  a role.\nI tried what you tried and also moving a file from one view to another.\nI'll try with the source and let you know. Might be, that the NppMsg which I've been using is old.. \n. Ehm : starting the debugger with 2015 VS without upgrading the compiler version does this:\nException thrown at 0x00007ffe51611f08 (KernelBase.dll) in Notepad++.exe: Microsoft C++ exception: std::exception at memory location 0x000000488e8818c0.\n= lol\n. So, problem reproduced with most actual version using VS2013 and debug.\nJust open up 4 files, place two on each view and move files from one view to another.\nEvent never fires - which probably could lead to unexpected behavior of clients ( plugins ).\n. Even when moving files from one view to another? Never fires for me.. Also tested the current master..\n. Hi @dail8859 . Yes, it's exactly the same. \nHow is this not a bug? If e.g. someone has a \"cache\" of opened files and listens to this event to update this cache he will fail, because if you move some file from one view to another between some opened tabs you are practically changing the order right ? So that would lead to crashes.\nOf course there are workarounds, like listening to \"buffer activated\" events and updating your list of files then. However this makes this event NPPN_DOCORDERCHANGED unusable in my opinion.\n. Any chance your pc or the process is running out of memory?\n. Will try to debug this my own and see wth is going on - will provide updates.\n. It's pretty obvious from the source that DSL tab settings aren't saved. \n@dail8859 Can you please tell me how to enable plugins when using the source? Then I can fix this issue easily.\n. OK, I will try it like this.\n. Fix merged with another plugin related pull request. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/863\nAlready tested this with most actual master. Works like a charm :)\n. I hope this get's committed.\n. @dail8859 \nAs requested:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/1242\n. Closing this since relevant PR never got merged and I stopped using the editor all together.. Do you have cloud settings?\n. Could you post here such a hyperlink for testing purposes? :) thanks.\n. It has to be merged first but I see no reason why it wouldn't  ..\n. Did you reload the file after changing the setting?\n. Bump. It's a freebie :)\n. @fade0ff so - what @dail8859  said. Open up a feature request at Scintilla. If they implement it.. then you may get what you want in the futrue.\nFeature request : http://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/feature-requests/\n. Thanks for the fix m8 :). Hope it get's merged.\n. I guess you are referring here to just the active session?\n. Line length can already be the screen if you use the \"Line Wrap\" feature.\n. @BBW1 the buffers get's corrupted. I have seen this behavior as well. Seems sporadic.. If u have such a file and can reproduce this you should upload it somewhere so the dev's can have a better look at it.\n. Please zip the file and upload it somewhere where it can be used for testing!\n. Would it make sense to move this discussion to Compare Plugin Git repo? :) As far it seems it has nothing to do with NPP directly.\n. Agree - could even use a standard compression library as default.\n. Very nice question. I am also confused about this and especially the \"destroy\" handle counterpart. Notepad++ has two views, two handles. Can some other plugin destroy one of those? If that were to happen, It could cause massive problems to other plugins..\n. IO stuff should be done asynchronously. Seems not to be the case here.\n. That's not an issue at all if you never close Npp. A far more critical and annoying issue is, that with many changes in the filesystem Npp just crashes and / or displays \"Queue Overflow\" popups.. That is annoying and unreliable.. @byronigoe I am not joking.. I am just using hibernation to prevent it from ever closing.. Until this is fixed, and it will be a while ( months ) if it ever gets fixed this is a simple workaround.\nI am more worried about the constant crashes when u update a lot of files together.. as when you compile/build something and the annoying \"queue overflow\" message box that comes with it.. It's really unstable.. Yeah I am noticing several crashes lately on different machines when files are added to directories/deleted or saved.. Something has gone terribly wrong.\n. Actually anything that locks the main UI thread should be put somewhere else.\n. @kbilsted  I'll try this today and give u feedback.\n. I can debug just fine.. \n. Put this in your commandMenuInit subroutine:\nDebugger.Launch();\nIt will launch the debugger every time you start your plugin. If you don't come this far, there's something else crashing the system before you get there, in which case, I suggest you build Npp yourself and start debugging that .. helped me in the past..\n. Really hope this is integrated lol. Currently I am using low level hooks to disable this auto completion..\n. Have at a look at my plugin. It works regardless of document size, plus it works only for the extensions I want it to work.\n.

Here is a comment from Neil Hodgson himself:\nOne difference between SciTE and Notepad++ is the runMarkers(true, 0, true, false); which could be taking the time.

SCI_SHOWLINES : SCI_HIDELINES, line, lineMaxSubord);\n    while (line <= lineMaxSubord) {\n        const int levelLine = wEditor.Call(SCI_GETFOLDLEVEL, line);\n        if (levelLine & SC_FOLDLEVELHEADERFLAG) {\n            wEditor.Call(SCI_SETFOLDEXPANDED, line, expand ? 1 : 0);\n        }\n        line++;\n    }\n}.

    "marcows": "@liuxuan30 I was not sure whether you meant compiling on Linux for Windows or on Linux for Linux. I fixed the first case, see issue #385 \n. I know about the switch to CMake, but it's not there yet. I initially submitted these patches on December 2014 (see Sourceforge patches), so this work already was existing before the CMake plans I think.\nAlso at that time it built properly without the C++11/14 compiler flag, so there might be some commits, which are not necessary now anymore, I just kept them to avoid destroying work.\nI only added changes necessary for a more or less clean build. Do you mean I should remove the patches fixing general build warnings and warnings not relevant with C++11/14 anymore and just keep the fixes for build errors? I will do it, but it's sad due to the invested time.\n. I could also create a new pull request with reduced commits after the CMake integration if you prefer. By merging the whole branch instead of selectively picking the commits, the logical relation to the GCC build of all the separate changes will be preserved in the repository history.\n. It seems CMake will not be integrated in the near future, so I rebased my patch series, eliminating all commits which are not strictly necessary (compile warning fixes) as suggested by @milipili.\n. See #1663\n. And for Scintilla see #1656\n. No, not yet.\ngit clone https://github.com/marcows/notepad-plus-plus.git\ncd notepad-plus-plus\ngit checkout -t origin/gcc-fixes\nFor everything else see Git documentation.\nNote that the MinGW build of Notepad++ is not successful currently even with those patches.\n. See #1229 for the MinGW package I used. Maybe you chose another one, I don't get your errors.\nRepeating mingw32-make -j4 (or a higher number for less iterations) until most files are compiled successfully should only leave these files remaining:\nfileBrowser.cpp\nReadDirectoryChangesPrivate.cpp\nReadDirectoryChanges.cpp\nwith following error message:\nReadDirectoryChanges.h:46:21:_ fatal error: atlbase.h: No such file or directory\nATL (used in new feature File browser) is not supported in MinGW.\n. @mzbab88 I just searched for this feature myself with the now working MinGW build with stub FileBrowser. Invoke menu \"File -> Open Folder as Workspace\". After chosing a directory, for the MinGW build the sidebar only shows the heading, which is expected and what I hoped for without crashing.\n. Nothing to download, NotepadPP.exe just has to find the needed dlls. You either have to copy them to the bin/ directory or expand the PATH variable accordingly. Affected files are libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll, libstdc++-6.dll, libwinpthread-1.dll, SciLexer.dll. See also gcc/readme.txt where it wrongly only talks about Wine usage.\n. I know, but haven't investigated because I was satisfied with the state for developing and never considered to use the MinGW build productively.\nsession.xml is affected as well and probably all other xml files whenever they are written.\n. If you have access to a Visual Studio installation on Windows, you could test the patches there as I don't have the possibility. This might increase the chance for being merged. Especially for the following two commits I do not know whether they have bad influence:\n6eb0ba0c28ff135738063c0caf89799a48f38f2a: Change backslashes to slashes for path names in .rc files\nc6fb4883b397d461dd90497c77fa9ef230592090: Convert localizationString.h from little endian UTF-16 to UTF-8\n. All I meant was testing that these two changes do not introduce regressions for the VS build, i.e. after a successful build checking that the menu icons are still existing and the UI language can still be switched.\n. For testing on Windows I used i686-5.2.0-release-win32-sjlj-rt_v4-rev1.7z.\nThis package only needs to be unzipped and \"mingw32\\bin\" has to be added to PATH environment variable.\nThen go to \"PowerEditor\\gcc\" and invoke make from command line:\nmingw32-make\nMaybe with e.g. option -j4 for faster build time using parallel jobs.\n. It would have been nice to keep the single steps in the repository history, but thanks anyway, Don! I'm really happy for this being applied now.\n. @slitazcn I just got the \"std::exception\" error as well. Reason was the missing SciLexer.dll file. Copy it to the bin/ directory beside NotepadPP.exe.\n. > @marcows Does vanilla Scintilla build fine with GCC/MinGW?\nYes.\n. According to Scintilla's README, Visual Studio is the main development system for the Windows build, but MinGW is also officially supported.\nAlso have a look at the corresponding issue.\nThere I wrote that Notepad++ extensions cause the errors.\n. With extensions I meant the differences in source code compared to vanilla Scintilla.\n. > > This pull request doesn't fix this problem.\n\n\n???\nSorry for the confusing description, this was just meant as additional information.\n\n\nRewording:\nThis pull request fixes many GCC compile warnings and some errors.\nHowever, some problems with MinGW, introduced by the recent addition of the file browser, are not fixed and still cause compile errors.\n. I have just pushed the branch with a new commit, which adds a minimal FileBrowser stub for MinGW. Now it can be built and is running successfully again because the unsupported ATL is not used anymore. There were no changes to the original source files needed for this.\n@mzbab88 Try out this reworked branch.\n. I have rebased my branch, conflicts resolved:\nhttps://github.com/marcows/notepad-plus-plus/tree/gcc-fixes\n. Rebased after conflicts and new errors.\nWith Linux/Wine (MinGW 5.3.0) I get a std:exception now, with Windows 7 (MinGW 5) it is running. When reverting the changes in PowerEditor/src/Notepad_plus.cpp from commit bd373788ad997f5d3fd97f9f874acf4081bb10bb it is running with Linux/Wine again.\n. Why is this PR applied after a few days while mine #1663, which included all of these changes and more, is dangling for months?\nThere is not even an associated issue, which is mandatory according to the contribution guide.\nThis is duplicated effort, these fixes have been implemented since a long time.\n. Yes, I had seen them. It was hard getting patches integrated upstream in the past and I just wanted to try one last time with my existing work. I don't plan continuing, the time is better spent elsewhere. As long as the GCC build is only second-class citizen, you will always be fixing after and need luck getting them applied.. ",

NppMenuIcons.1.10++.zip\nCustomize Toolbar Images + Some Python Scripts.zip\nJust uploading to GitHub.\n. @vgezer,\nI can not reproduce it with NP++ v6.8 and Compare v1.5.6.6.\nTry Compare v1.5.6.7. I've slightly modified UFO's code some time ago.\nRegards.\n. Interestingly, if you press \"Close All\" - the 'Save All' button IS greyed out.\n. @juef17,\nI can not reproduce it with Compare v1.5.6.6.\nRegards.\n. @juef17,\nI'm still using NP v6.8.\nI'm on Win7 32-bit.\nDid you remove all the older version's files before installing the new one? \nTry Compare v1.5.6.7. I've slightly modified UFO's code some time ago.\n. @juef17,\nGreat. Please check again and confirm.\nFollowing your STR, there's a problem (not a crash though);\nThe new empty file displays \"NUL\" at the beginning. I reported it to UFO about a year ago.\nUnfortunately, it seems that UFO has abandoned the project.\n. My pleasure.\n. @Eldaw,\nThe original developer abandoned the project a long time ago.\nUFO has done a great job.\nAs far as I know, there isn't a site for the recent versions (apart from the Bitbucket repository). \nYou might want to check the following threads:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/482781/thread/1ed3f576/\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/482781/thread/f035f7b6/\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/482781/thread/30c87332/?page=0\n. You're welcome.\n. @Petewg,\nYou need to change the commands in CustomizeToolbar.btn to Greek.\nRegards.\n. @Petewg,\nI'm glad I could help.\nI keep two \"CustomizeToolbar.btn\" files: one in English and one in my local language.\nPlease see this request.\nEDIT:\nI mean the post below (\"And, with your permission, another request:\").\nThe link takes you to the beginning of some nested posts. \nBest regards. \n. Hello @chcg and all,\n\nThere is another issue with the current RTL and LTR defaults. Microsoft has used for a very long time the standard ctl-alt plus a key to globally launch applications. (you set it from right clicking on a shortcut and setting shortcut key)\n\nI've never used that.\nSo the problem is with any Ctr+Alt+Key. Alt+Key may also conflict with Windows convention of opening a menu (in Compare Plugin @pnedev replaced Alt+Key with Ctr+Alt+Key because of that).\nUnfortunately there aren't many available combinations.\nLCtrl/RCtrl+LShift/RShift are indeed the conventional combinations for changing the text direction.\n. @kraint,\nThanks.\n. See guy038's comments.\nComparePlugin.v1.5.6.7 NewImages NoDefault.bin.zip\nComparePlugin.v1.5.6.7 OldImages NoDefault.bin.zip\n. Hi Ede123,\nThat's great news. Thank you so much.\nI have to retire now.\nI'll write tomorrow in more detail.\nBest regards. \n. Hello Ede123,\nThe current state of the Compare Plugin is indeed a mess and has to change.\nThanks again for referring me to jsleroy's repo. \nI'm not an experienced developer.\nI first installed VS 2013 about a year ago in order to add an option to close the compared files.\nApart from that, I concentrated on slightly improving the Scroll Sync and Wrap management.\nIt works well, but the structure of the code is not very elegant. It was written as a proposed draft for UFO.\nI'd highly appreciate it if you could review it.\n(Compare the original compare.cpp and my modified file; I've added \"// Yaron\" to my changes and some (alas, too) short comments).\nMore important is finding the cause of the crash when comparing the files in Test.zip and testing my proposed fix.\nI'll open some new issues (for the above mentioned points and more) in jsleroy's repo, and we could continue our discussion there.\nI'll also ask jsleroy to have a look and guy038 to contribute.\nSome references to related discussions on SourceForge:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/482781/thread/1ed3f576/\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/482781/thread/f035f7b6/\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/482781/thread/30c87332/   \nBest regards.  \nCompare Original and Modified.zip\n. OK. :)\nAny help would be appreciated.\nCould you try and ask Pavel to join in?\nI'll open some more issues in the coming days (it seems to be more difficult than I thought ; apart from the crash issue I discovered recently, I haven't dealt with the other issues during the last year).\nLet's hope jsleroy does find some free time to help.\nRegards.\n. Hi Pavel,\nGreat to have you aboard. Thank you so much.\nThe ultimate goal, as Ede123 has mentioned, is have an updated stable version provided to users via the Plugin Manager.\nI've opened some issues. Here is my triage (I trust your judgment):\n1) v1.5.6.7: Occasional crashes and a proposed fix.\n2) Compare results are cleared when a THIRD file is closed.\n3) Compare and NPP Recent Files list.\n4) \"nul\" is added when comparing a cloned empty file.\n5) [Review Request] Some modifications in compare.cpp.\n6) [Suggestion] A new extra Status Bar for Compare.\nWe would appreciate any help. :)\nBest regards.\n. Hello Pavel,\nSure. At your leisure.\nThanks again and best of luck. :)\nRegards.\n. Hello,\nI owe UFO an apology.\nWhat I thought was an improvement in comparing with Wrap mode, is actually a regression (back to v1.5.6.3 behavior) in many cases.\n(Compare the files in Test2.zip).\nWe shouldn't use NPP vertical scroll sync but rather UFO's \"case SCN_UPDATEUI:\".\n\nNPP enabling and disabling the Sync Scroll commands is somewhat inconsistent.\nTherefore my changes relating to restoring the Sync Scroll state are too complex and not worth it.\nBack to UFO's Restore Sync Scroll.\nSee guy038's comment and UFO's reply.\nBest regards.\nComparePlugin.v1.5.6.7.NewImages.NoDefault.bin.zip\nComparePlugin.v1.5.6.7.OldImages.NoDefault.bin.zip\n\nHopefully, the last post here. :)\n. Hello @dail8859,\nMay I ask your opinion about the proposed fix in https://github.com/pnedev/compare-plugin/issues/19?\nThank you.\nBest regards.\n. Hello dail,\nThank you for looking at it. I appreciate it.\nBest regards.\n. OK now.\nThanks.\n. Hello,\nI'd like to add a related request: an option to move to the last active tab (i.e. move from the current tab to the previously active one).\nThank you.\nBR\n. Seems to be fixed.\nThanks.\n. Hello,\nSome simple changes in three NPP source files seem to solve this issue.\nIn Notepad_plus.h replace\nvoid doClose(BufferID, int whichOne, bool doDeleteBackup = false);\nwith\nvoid doClose(BufferID, int whichOne, bool doDeleteBackup = false, bool addToClosedList = true);\nIn Notepad_plus.cpp replace\n//just close the activate document, since thats the one we moved (no search)\ndoClose(_pEditView->getCurrentBufferID(), currentView());\nwith\n//just close the activate document, since thats the one we moved (no search)\ndoClose(_pEditView->getCurrentBufferID(), currentView(), false, false);\nIn NppIO.cpp replace\nvoid Notepad_plus::doClose(BufferID id, int whichOne, bool doDeleteBackup)\nwith\nvoid Notepad_plus::doClose(BufferID id, int whichOne, bool doDeleteBackup, bool addToClosedList)\nand also replace\nif (PathFileExists(buf->getFullPathName()))\nwith\nif (PathFileExists(buf->getFullPathName()) && addToClosedList)\nThank you.\nBR. Hello @SinghRajenM,\nThank you for this fix. :+1: \nUsing NPP in a RTL interface (e.g. Hebrew), the Close button in the Find dialog is cut off.\n\nI use VS 2013 Express which doesn't include a Resource Editor.\nI've managed to manually fix the problem in the Find and the Replace tabs.\nThe Find in Files and the Mark tabs seem to be more complex.\nMay I ask you to have a look? - I'd appreciate that.\nBest regards.\n. Hello @SinghRajenM,\nExcellent! :+1: \nThank you very much.\nMoving the \". matches newline\" is a bonus.\nIsn't this more relevant to Regex? - Wouldn't it be better increase the dialog width and restore its previous position?\nAlso, the localization files should be updated for this item.\nBest regards.\n. Hello @SinghRajenM,\nReally nice.\nThank you very much.\nThanks also for your other contributions. They are all great.\nBest regards.\n. @SinghRajenM,\nThanks.\n. Hello SinghRajenM,\nAs I've mentioned before: your contributions are great.\nThank you.\nBest regards.\n. Hello Guy,\nThank you for this reply as well. I appreciate it.\nAs always, I've learned some nice tips. :)\nBut I think it would be useful to have the requested behavior as a NPP option.\nBest regards.\n. Hello Guy,\nI hope you're getting better. :)\nThank you very much for this reply.\nI downloaded a portable NPP and, indeed, all was well.\nI changed the layout to RTL and, still, no problem.\nIt turns out that the culprit is my SciLexer.dll.\nSome time ago I posted the following lines in the forum:\n\n```\nHello,\nWhen NPP 6.7 came out I updated to it from v6.5.4.\nSomewhere between those version a change in the source-files introduced the following bug:\nLeft-click in the Line-Margin (the line is selected).\nRight-click in the same spot.\nResult:\nIn v6.5.4 the Edit commands in the context-menu are available.\nFrom v6.7 the line is deselected and, as a consequence, the Edit commands are not available.\nI filed a bug at the time but, so far, it hasn\u2019t been addressed.\nThis is important to my workflow and I\u2019d like to change it myself.\nI\u2019d appreciate your help finding the culprit. :)\nThank you.\n```\n\nSomeone kindly sent me a modified SciLexer.dll solving that issue.\nAt the time I did not notice the problem (described in this thread) it created, and when I did I wrongly assumed it was a NPP issue.\nLesson: test first with all original files.\nMy sincere apologies.\nBest regards. \n. Hello @SinghRajenM,\n@pnedev has been doing wonders to the most popular Compare Plugin.\nThis issue and https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/2277 affect Compare Plugin to some degree and should be addressed in NPP.\nMay I ask you to preview the proposed solutions and submit them as PRs?\nI would highly appreciate that.\nNOTE:\nIf you do take it, the code proposed here can be slightly optimized by modifying the beginning of the function.\nThank you very much.\nBest regards. \n.

Didn't know that. \nYou mean things like: ALT+0 and the reverse SHIFT+ALT+0 ? Or: ALT+h hiding lines?\nThey still work and do what they should!\nNow, what does that mean to us?\ndiff\n-                    <Item menuId=\"file\" name=\"&amp;File\"/>\n-                    <Item menuId=\"edit\" name=\"&amp;Edit\"/>\n-                    <Item menuId=\"search\" name=\"&amp;Search\"/>\n+                    <Item menuId=\"file\" name=\"File\"/>\n+                    <Item menuId=\"edit\" name=\"Edit\"/>\n+                    <Item menuId=\"search\" name=\"Search\"/>\nIn the linked page it says:\n\nIn the Properties Window, in the Caption property, type a new name for the control, typing an ampersand (&) in front of the letter you want as the access key for that control. For example, &Radio1.\n\nJust checked it. Its the underline caption thing in the bar(s), activated by ALT. Both & and &amp; approaches work.\nChecking translated files with the latter is not that nice, so I would pled to use the & generally.\nWhat do you think?\n. ",

    "Eldaw": "It worked for everything from 'New 1' onwards, but it didn't work for 'New  0' which still gets created with 2 spaces when Notepad++ first starts. Also, there is a separate bug relating to New  0. When creating new tabs, if none are currently open that start with 'New ' then Notepad++ starts counting from 1. It never creates a new tab named 'New  0' except for when it is first started.\n. Any chance someone could fix this, pretty please! :)\n. milipili, it's not clear why you believe these are related. This issue is about the positioning of the little Yes/No/Cancel 'Save' dialog that appears initially, not the choice of which dialog gets used for 'Save As' where you get to enter a filename and choose a location, etc.\n. I really hope this enhancement can be implemented. When running Notepad++ on a large, high-resolution monitor, the dialog can appear quite far from the main Notepad++ window.\n. ariccio, it sounds to me like you are a skilled developer. However, I must say that I (as someone who is not a C++ developer) do wonder why you choose to contribute only changes that relate to the technical correctness of the code.\nOn this project's growing Issues list are quite a number of small usability bugs and usability enhancement requests. I bet that some of them could be quickly implemented with just a couple of lines of code and make a big difference to the experience of using the application.\nAll I'm saying is I wonder if it wouldn't be a better use of your expertise to knock some of those out.\n. @MAPJe71 Yes, I agree with you. Do you think it would make sense to specifically target some of the reported bugs, usability enhancements, and functional enhancements, and at the same time make sure that the introduced code is technically correct? Rather than only making general changes which might also end up making some of the reported issues stale/obsolete as a side effect, but might not.\n. @Cyrillev91 Now that this has been merged into v6.8.4., how can I get the smart highlighting to work like in the last column of your test? Right now, the smart highlighting is still working like it always has, and if I select END-OF-FILE then it doesn't highlight other instances of END-OF-FILE.\n. I agree.\n. Yes, whether the crash is directly caused by this behaviour or not, Notepad++ should definitely not be interfering with the configuration files of Google Drive, especially since I've never configured it to do anything with Google Drive.\nMy suspicion about the cause of the crash is that Google Drive is probably not expecting its configuration files to be locked by another application. And when Google Drive itself is then unable to write to its own configuration files, bad things happen. That's my theory.\n. I agree that it would make sense to have these extra case-changing options built directly into Notepad++. They currently exist in the TextFX plugin, and I've used them a few times.\n. Does this resolve issue #182 I created some time ago?\n. @hypherion2 In the first attempt it looks like you also had a fix for the Macro toolbar buttons issue I reported in #172. Are you going to resubmit a separate pull request for that issue too?\n. I agree\n. Also, Home and End keys.\n. I think this is a good PR. In cases where the user has a white theme and would like a small border, they can always leave the border value set to at least 1.\n. Do you mean for word count only? If so, then I still think it would be a good idea to replace 'length' with 'characters'. On the rare occasions where one would like to see the EOL markers included in the count,  the 'View -> Summary' feature could be used.\n. Indeed, as far as I can tell, 'length' appears to be a count of visible/printable characters + EOL characters. For every CRLF newline in a Windows file, the length displayed on the statusbar goes up by 2.\nI'd prefer the statusbar to just show the count of visible/printable characters. Thus, replace 'length' with 'characters'.\n. With the value set to 3, as you did, there are 2 rows of blank pixels above the buttons (i.e. above the square border of a pressed button) and 3 rows of blank pixels below.\nWith the value set to 4, as I have done, there are 2 rows of blank pixels above the buttons and 2 rows of blank pixels below. And therefore the buttons are perfectly centered on the toolbar, exactly as they should be. The buttons and their borders don't touch anything else.\n. @Rikk \nSounds good to me. I'll commit your suggested changes...\n. I see that @donho has just committed a fix for an issue when accessing the Delimiter preferences.\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/19476bbbaed6a0421d2f234839d8dbe40e663b37\nDoes that fix this problem that I reported? If so, it would have been nice of him to acknowledge my bug report.\n. > Is this a variation of what is reported here: #529 ?\nNo, I don't think so.\n. All of these versions past 1.5.6.2  -- are they now developed by somebody other than the original developer? The main (old?) website only refers to v1.5.6.2.  Apart from the Bitbucket repository linked to in this discussion, is there a web site associated with the newer versions of the Compare plugin?\n. Thanks Yaron10, I'll check those threads out. It's good to know that further work has been done on the Compare plugin.\n. See this:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/44e9a03101e132fad856da449f422c1a515c0d36\n. I submitted an excellent pull request some time back to address this issue, which also addressed the fact that Macintosh uses LF (by calling the CR one 'Classic Mac'). Unfortunately it was rejected by @donho for a reason that made no sense.\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/787\n. I finally moved to VS Code, which handles the moving of lines perfectly. I can now move lines without selecting them -- what a concept!\nThis is just one example of several simple things that @donho has never cared about, which likely have no prospect of ever being fixed in Notepad++..

    "ygoe": "I don't know what installer you use, but InnoSetup long has an option to start the process non-elevated. It does so because it keeps the non-elevated initial setup process around, which starts both the elevated setup, and the final application (in the original session).\n. The existing mapping cannot be removed. Then I added the same hotkey to the other command. Now both commands share the same hotkey and neither can be removed again. That looks like a problem to me.\n. Unfortunately that plugin doesn't work for me. I still get that desktop message.\nIs the elevation feature already available in a stable build? I see that version label assigned to it but don't get that behaviour in my installation. It still asks to save on the desktop.\nI haven't seen any editors that support UAC in this natural way. All of them either ask for a different location to save, or bail out with an access denied message. I have some experience with file managers (Windows Explorer, Speed Commander) that support UAC. While Windows Explorer would ask for every single copied file (with the option to remember for all remaining files of the current batch), Speed Commander seems to have some timeout when it won't ask anymore. From what I've observed about Speed Commander, I believe it uses some COM activation thing, but I don't understand how these work. My closest work in this regard was using .NET WCF for that task, with a separate executable. (IIRC the separate executable was necessary for some reason.)\nAs you're talking about security concerns, I'm wondering how it can be ensured that the elevated process really does what it's supposed to do. If you're telling it the path through command line arguments, then how will the user know that these arguments haven't been tampered with? Sure the user can expand that UAC dialog window, but it's of limited size. The elevated process might display a confirmation message on the path. But then, what about the content itself?... Anyway, the path and content is ultimately defined by the non-elevated GUI part of the application, and that could always be manipulated. So this risk might not be possible to mitigate.\nDo you think of supporting restricted read access files as well, or just restricted write access? If the non-elevated process can read and monitor the file, only the actual writing needs to be handled. The elevated process wouldn't necessarily need to be kept after it's done its job. Though it would be easier for the user if it were alive for as long as any affected document is still open. You need some IPC channel anyway to send the content to the elevated process. Not sure what C++ has to offer here.\nMaybe it's better to concentrate on this write-only aspect first as it happens often when modifying system config files. Those files are mostly write-protected but publicly readable (think of that etc/hosts file).\n. > Why does the UAC dialog's size matter?\nBecause it can only display so much of the command line arguments which include the path to write to. This is probably the only place where the user could reliably verify the elevated action.\nBut as I think I already concluded, as long as things are controlled from a non-elevated process, nothing can be guaranteed. So the elevated process might as well be dumb and just do the work, a simple helper process. If you don't trust your computer and your user session, you should probably not be an administrator. Problem solved (sufficiently for now). If you don't agree to this level of security, don't use that feature and start the whole GUI as admin instead. With all its improved security and its usability disadvantages. Most people can live with it.\n\nEh? It's defined? Again, threat modeling, specifics.\n\nEh? Please specify your question.\n\nThere's no such thing as write-only access\n\nBecause you made it up. I never said that. I said \"restricted write access\", short \"write-protected\" which my dictionary says means \"protected against writing (but free to read)\".\nI don't know how gksudo is implemented so I can't say anything about that. I'm not a regular with Linux desktops, I'm only working in the shell over there.\n. If only to get rid of that badly readable MS Sans Serif from the old times. The rest of the UI seems to use 8pt Tahoma (better). From Vista on, the default font is 9pt Segoe UI (even better) which is used for the menu only.\n. There is a lot more nuisance going on with that table. It doesn't surprise me that it's not accessible. See also #909.\n. The last point is probably the bug that is by far most annoying me today. I use indented text files a lot to take notes. When I add a blank line in front of an unindented line, that happens to be after a line indented by one tab, that previously unindented line now becomes indented! Very much not expected. I hope this issue will be the next thing being worked on, if anything is done at NPP at all (I don't see many buges fixed, just more new ones opened).\n. Any news on this? It keeps bugging me every single day I work with it. Does this project have any kind of priority of bugs over features? I'd rather have a tool that does well what it does, instead of one that does everything just mean. There have been at least two new feature releases alone since the last comment here. I don't have much time to work on this tool besides the other tools I'm already making for my work, but is there any news on building Notepad++ with Visual Studio 2015 so I could at least try to take a look at this bug?\n. @A-R-C-A There is still the outdated Boost library that requires VS 2013. Could somebody please fix that first? I can't do anything otherwise. I've tried it before and failed.\n. @MAPJe71 I'll try to find the time to make all these patches of stuff work together. All in all, Notepad++ seems really abandoned like this. Future promises never kept, finished bug fixes not released after months, open bugs not fixed before working on new features, pull requests not accepted, and not even any communication. I was assigned the German translation but never provided with any information required to work so I never did anything \u2013 I don't feel responsible for it anymore, so it may officially be abandoned as well. I'm not sure whether this is a project I should invest in. I have my own plans of making a Scintilla-based editor that are largely covered by Notepad++ but the missing parts may never be realised.\n. As opposed to the initial report, the indenting is wrongly restored for any level.\n\u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Text<Enter>\n<Backspace 3x><Enter>\n\u2192 \u2192 \u2192\n\nIt also happens when you're not typing all this straight ahead but insert a new line somewhere after an indented line.\nI'd expect that auto-indenting should only happen when I press Enter at the end of a line. Not when I press Enter at the beginning of the following lines. And certainly not when that line is not empty, because that will not only move that line down but indent it and thereby modify its meaning.\nAnd it is annoying every single day. I'm constantly fixing up the mess Notepad++ causes.\nDoes this bug get any attention by someone who is able to handle the code? Maybe even before we get more shiny features? I understand that it is more interesting to create new features, but technical debt will catch you some day and it is by far less appealing to users who are actually affected by this. And I guess that's >\u00a050\u00a0%. Annoyed users just won't appreciate your new features.. @dcomtois According to its description, it only affects backspace-unindenting with spaces instead of tabs. (I'm using tabs here and most elsewhere.) It should have no effect on automatic indenting on line breaks.. If the Notepad++ source code isn't completely messed up (I'm not sure), it is easy to fix that.\nIt's just not easy to build it from source (with a current set of tools), or I'd already have fixed it myself. This thing keeps up my dreams of creating my own Scintilla-based editor. These dreams would die a little if Notepad++ would stop adding features and start fixing bugs.. Could the find/replace input fields just use the default editor font? So it looks consistent with no additional configuration.\n. Not smaller. The editor font I chose is good the way it is.\n. Why not.\n. Can't reproduce this either. I tried it in the most likely way (directory follows file; open only a single document) because I know this issue from another text editor. Pleased to see that NPP does not lock the directory.\n. The text cursor is also too thin. It's a single device pixel whereas (at 200%) it should be 2 device pixels like in every other application. I can barely see it between the text. Should I open a new issue for this?\n. Great, thanks! I just copied my config over from the PC where 1 is a good value. Now I can even select 3 pixels, which would be 1.5 on a regular monitor. :-) Everybody should have a 200% scaled monitor!\n. I don't see how #563 is related to this issue.\nIMO the resize grip simply needs to be removed. Should be a simple flag or option to set correctly to reflect the window's actual properties. #563 could add this grip again, but until then it's irritating.\n. -wrong issue-\n. When I select one entire line excluding the line break, I get \"\u2026 | 0\".\nWhen I select the line break as well, I get \"\u2026 | 2\".\nWhere did 1 go? I'd suggest considering the characters on the first line as one line. Also I'd suggest ignoring a single line break at the very end of the selection. When I select entire lines all from the first column (where I keep my cursor most of the time when dealing with entire lines), I'd like to know the number of lines I've selected, not the number of lines that selection and cursor somehow touch.\n. There are more whitespace characters in Unicode. Perhaps the most interesting are:\n- U+0020 \"Space\"\n- U+00A0 \"No-Break Space\"\n- U+202F \"Narrow No-Break Space\"\nThe normal space is the only of them that is visualised. But it's hardly visible so tiny is the symbol for it. It should definitely be a thicker graphic.\nThe other two mentioned should have different symbols. Microsoft Word for example shows something like \u00b0 for the non-breaking space, but also nothing for the narrow non-breaking space.\nThere's a more complete overview in Wikipedia (not available in English).\n. The browse for folder dialog is actually a pretty ancient one. Windows Vista introduced new file dialogs that are much easier to use. They can also be used to select folders now, replacing that ugly and unfriendly folder browse dialog from the older days. NPP already makes use of the latest file dialog version in open/save, so it should also do so in the find dialog.\n. Fortunately not ran into this yet in the last few days, but it's good to be warned!\n:+1: \n. That looks easy. Can you please do the same for #879?\n. Here's a screen recording (MP4 H.264, 850 kB) in a clean Windows 8.1 environment. It behaves differently from my Windows 7 work machine. On Windows 7 the control additionally decreases in height massively. On Windows 8 only the width decreases.\n. That dialog is the most broken thing I've seen in a very long time, really!\n. Well, I mostly know applications that do scroll beyond the last line. Visual Studio, TextPad, Word (in Draft view)... Windows Notepad and most GUI text boxes (which Notepad is likely based on) on the other hand do not. I don't use Notepad though so it has no influence on me.\nRoom to type means that I don't stick in the last line of the view with every line I type. I don't like typing in such tight space and prefer a little more room below. I'm not talking about \"virtual lines\" or \"virtual cursor\" which could go further to the right than the length of the current line. I'm not using that. Last time I've seen that was in DOS editors or IDEs (was it Turbo Pascal?).\nCentre? Why that? I have absolutely really never seen such behaviour. It's either the top or the bottom. Anything else wouldn't make any sense IMO.\nI see one point however that you could argue about: The scroll bar. When not scrolling beyond the last line, the scroll bar properly represents the currently visible part of the document relative to the entire document. That's how scoll bars work since Windows 95 and it's really practical. TextPad for example even keeps it that way when scrolling beyond the last line. The scroll bar is still as long as the viewport but sticks at the bottom and doesn't move any further down while scrolling the last line further up. Scintilla alters the scroll bar as soon as that extended scrolling is enabled: It effectively extends the document size by one viewport height and keeps moving the scroll bar further down as the last line is scrolling up the screen. This has the probably undesirable effect that the scroll bar does not touch the bottom when the last line of the document is displayed at the bottom of the screen. This gives you the impression that the document goes on when it really doesn't. Fixing this behaviour might need a change in Scintilla itself.\nBTW, the plugin works fine so I'm using that for now. Based on the large number of plugins for any situation, I believe the use of plugins is common to NPP so this might already be the solution. I'm not sure whether an integrated option would be preferable. At least, the plugin description reads as if it's just a simple Scintilla switch, so it should be easy to implement. It would probably be easier to find as an integrated option.\n. - I'm fine with the added visual indication although I wouldn't request it.\n- Ctrl+End goes to the end of the document, not the end of the line. Also, I wouldn't change that hotkey in any way. Explicit scrolling is done with Ctrl+Up/Down and this works as expected with the plugin installed.\n- No scroll jumps when typing, please. You're adding too much unexpected logic that might not even be requested by anyone. I'd just keep it simple and limit the work to what's needed now. Again, other editors don't feature any of the additional things you listed.\n. Okay, if I don't press Ctrl+End twice, I won't be affected by a change in that hotkey. I don't mind. Maybe I'll even find it useful one day... ;-)\nI want to be able to get that room to type. If the editor constrains the scrolling to the document length, it is impossible to get that room. If I can scroll further, it is possible an I'm close to happy. I only need to actually scroll down to get what I want. All editors I know do it like that. When the editor starts being smart and jump me around, I might lose orientation because I may not want to go so far as to see nothing above the current line anymore. So just don't implement that thinking for me, it saves you the work. :-)\nBasically, all I'm asking for is the integration of the ScrollPastEOF plugin, and adjust the scrollbar so that it behaves like this plugin wasn't installed. When scrolled down to what is possible without the plugin now, the scrollbar is at the bottom end. When scrolling further, it should just not change anymore.\n. As I said, I wouldn't want to set the additional space to anything other than 100% of the viewport height. Or to be very precise, I want the last line of the document to be in the first visible line. Not above or below that (we don't have pixel scrolling, so it's easy to define that). Smaller values just feel arbitrary and unnatural to me.\n\nBut then you loose the ability to scroll this far by means of dragging the scrollbar rectangle.\n\nCorrect and accepted. Plus you have the mouse wheel. That's still plenty of options. That's how TextPad works for example. Visual Studio, on the other hand, does exactly what the ScrollPastEOF plugin does now. You just don't get a sense of the length of the document when the scrollbar doesn't indicate it correctly.\n\nThis is inconsistent behavior for me.\n\nSo is extending the scroll space by a fixed number of lines for me. BTW, did you consider to limit that configured number to the actual height of the viewport? I really don't want to lose the end of the document way outside the viewport in small windows...\n. Hm, I'd not consider the contents of a line. If the last line is empty, that could still be scrolled to the top. If you create a document of a thousand empty lines today, you could scroll all the way through it and would never see any non-empty content. It's nothing else.\nThe rest sounds good to me. Just out of curiosity, are you an active developer of NPP or more of the \"community manager\" type?\n. Also, closing a tab through middle-click should focus the other document editor area, not keep the focus on the tab itself as it is now.\n. Correction: I have found the option to disable link underlining. It's in the last options page. Links appear as normal text now (black, not underlined) and always change to blue, underlines when hovering. When clicking once, the format is reset and the cursor is placed in the link. When moving the mouse cursor a single pixel in any direction, the link is formatted again (blue, underlined). A bit inconsistent and very unintuitive.\nIt's still not possible (or I haven't found out how) to make all hyperlinks blue without hovering them.\nI'm fine with the tooltip, Microsoft Word has it, too. Helps the user immediately.\nNo idea about the keyboard shortcut. Maybe a Ctrl+letter hotkey would be okay? Like Ctrl+L or so.\n. That is the default and I did try. But even explicitly selecting the \"ANSI\" encoding from the menu did not work when \"Windows-1252\" worked. Both should be the same. If they aren't, I don't know what \"ANSI\" is. Maybe the current meaning of it should be included in parentheses, like: ANSI (Windows-1252)\n. There are actually lots of other inconsistencies and errors in the German translation (inconsistent wording, multiple hotkey definition) and I'm currently correcting that file. Expect an updated pull request soon.\n. I have indeed found a Wikipedia article that shows using a space before an ellipsis for GUI command texts in a single example, but there's no explanation or reference for that given nor is the use of a space explicitly mentioned here, so it's unverifyable and might be a mistake. Let me list other applications that don't use a space before the ellipsis:\n- Every single application part of the Windows operating system\n- Adobe Lightroom\n- Adobe Photoshop\n- Avira AntiVirus\n- Beyond Compare\n- CDBurnerXP\n- DVBViewer\n- Google Earth\n- InkScape\n- IrfanView\n- Microsoft Office\n- Microsoft Visual Studio\n- Mozilla Firefox\n- Mozilla Thunderbird\n- Paint.net\n- Pidgin\n- Speed Commander\n- TeamViewer\n- TextPad\nDo you know any of them? Some of these applications were made in Germany, others are professionally translated. I did not find any application on my computer with a German UI that uses a space in that place, except Notepad++. Now you say all of them are wrong? Prove it.\nAs for where ellipses are used at all, I find you link an interesting reference and will look through all menu commands again to correct the use of \"\u2026\" where necessary.\n. Correct, nothing is omitted here so these rules do not apply.\nDoes anybody know how ellipses at the end of sentences (not as omission) are correctly written in English? I couldn't find consistent information in Wikipedia. If they expect a space as well (like in German), then menu labels seem to define their own category and their use cannot be inferred from text writing rules. If that's the case, I'd strongly suggest doing it the way everybody does it and not stand out.\n(And even if not, I'd question why we should not follow common practice. Microsoft and Adobe do have some weight in this matter. Think of \"Kennwort\" when people commonly use the Denglish word \"Passwort\" because it's \"password\" in English. Open-source software is sadly often translated by people who lack the necessary sense of detail which can sometimes be seen on the user interface as well. Large commercial software makers employ specially trained experts for these things.)\n. > The Wikipedia article acknowledges that an ellipsis doesn't necessarily indicate an omission\nBut the menu command isn't an enumeration either. Still doesn't apply.\n\nThe MSDN documentation pages seem to be automatically\n\nOnly recently. It wasn't the case in earlier versions. Even today, \"automatically translated\" doesn't mean it threw away what was manually translated before and hasn't changed. Unfortunately, they sometimes forgot to update localised sites so they are partly outdated and misleading. And they really messed it up with their translation help nagging. That's why I actually prefer the en-US site today. Not for the language of manually translated content.\n\nAlso, \" - \" is still used regularly, although a proper en dash (\" \u2013 \") would not be a problem with fonts like Segoe UI\n\nBut it is a problem with the commonly used keyboard layout. Do you always want to press Alt+0150 when you have a hyphen at hand? Blame it for keyboard layouts. The same applies to quotation marks or even the ellipsis. I've made my own keyboard layout so I can use them, but still Shift+2 is easier than what was still free for more advanced characters (AltGr+Shift+2 and AltGr+Shift+3 in my case).\n\nPrograms as VLC media player are renowned software\n\nFor technical implementation, yes. Certainly not for UI. Linux is a very good examply IMO. It's been the superior server platform from the start but couldn't catch up on the desktop for a very long time. Today, both are learning from each other, finally.\nAny more arguments? Can we get back to business?\nI'll look into the other issues mentioned above but I likely won't get to it until next week.\n. One more point: Menu items aren't even sentences. All the examples we've seen so far apply to sentences. But yes, more opinions, please!\n. Great, so now it's us against the world. I still don't like this new inconsistency. When I was advocating typography things in the past, there was at least some consent, but this time it's very little. To do things right, the three dots would need to be replaced by the ellipsis character as well. Let's see where we can improve typography in the UI elsewhere. How about the dash between file name and application title? But be aware that where \" \u2013 \" (en dash) is common in German, last time I checked at least US English seems to prefer \"\u2014\" (em dash, no spaces). Not sure about world English now. Maybe some quotes and apostrophes could also be improved in the English translation as well. (Side note: The quotes are broken in the Tahoma font used before Vista, also in Verdana.)\nI'd wish the same level of detail and correctness could be found in other parts of the UI. I'm thinking at the settings dialog that feels quite messy. It's even hard to translate that because there's so little space in it and it just won't extend for the content.\nWell okay, you get your spaces back. I still don't agree with that. I'll update the pull request next week (I'm away for the weekend and getting more busy now).\nAm I ready for this responsibility? I don't even know what my task would be. I was just fixing some things I found. I sure can do it in the future if something needs to be updated. I'm not watching the development progress very closely so somebody might need to notify me before a new release.\n. I've updated the file.\n@xylographe \"Count: X matches.\" does not seem to be localisable. It comes from the code itself. I can only edit the XML file.\n. The same applies to the tab indenting rulers, they also appear brightly above the darker selection background.\n. Mixing/blending colours would be the ideal way. And with it, people should be able to specify their colours including the alpha value (opacity) to control the effect. The basic Windows colour picker is certainly not suitable for that. It's primitive enough for picking RGB colours.\n. Actually I believe that the edge is painted over characters as well. Enable the display of line endings in the View menu and push a line ending under that edge. Since the line ending symbol is wider than a normal character, it extends across that pixel column. In my case, the bright line separates the white-on-black \"LF\" indicator in two parts!\n. NN, please turn on your speakers and enable the default sound profile, then you hear what I mean.\n. I'm not aware of any. The only non-default plugin I have installed is ScrollPastEOF. What config options could affect this behaviour?\n. I can reproduce this with factory defaults.\nI'm still looking for a screen recorder, I need it for other bug reports as well. Any recommendations?\n. I have now installed NPP 6.8.3 in a complete fresh environment, this is now Windows 8.1 x64. It's still the same thing. 100 % reproducible, everywhere.\n. I can't find any or a single option for \"auto backup\". But I have everything in defaults now. This is a completely clean environment, a freshly installed Windows with only one other application installed. I use it as clean test environment and can revert it to a snapshot easily. So you should know what my configuration is on that machine. I didn't change it.\n. Here's a screen recording (MP4 H.264, 950 kB) in a clean Windows 8.1 environment.\n. I don't understand anything of what you said. Is it even related to this issue? What is the \"mark menu\"? Where is the \"clear\" button? I have not associated anything, I have just installed NPP in a clean environment and used the mark command.\n. Ah, inside that dialog... The German translation sounds like \"Reset\" so I didn't know what you mean. In English the label is \"Clear\" which is something else maybe. Alright, so it's my fault and this issue can be closed.\n. I only noticed because I was starting it quite often today during bug hunting. Normally I'd keep it open until the next patchday as well.\n. I can easily run my Windows 7 for several months, but Windows updates become too annyoing then so I give in and let them install. This definitely leads to a restart after more than a month.\n. I'm not sure anything is resolved quickly at all here. I'm observing quite a number of issues by now and there hasn't been anything but discussion. At least some of the discussion brought up some workarounds.\n. The nppexec plugin had a problem and it was not recommended to install it. I'd vote for the integrated option.\n. Thanks for the workaround. I also needed to select another font to make more fine-grained adjustments. When 10pt Consolas is your editor font, 10pt Tahoma makes one pixel more per line. 11pt Consolas is already much bigger.\n. Why is there even a langs.xml file in the user profile directory if the user has nothing to do with it? Just remove it and use the file from the installation directory instead. Problem solved.\nAnd stylers.xml does have everything in it, not just what the user has modified. Even worse, what's not in that file can't be modified by the user. This caused me some trouble with an outdated stylers.xml in #4007.\nThe entire concept of maintaining full copies of files that the user may modify is broken. Instead, only modified data must be stored with the user profile, and files from the installation directory must be used as fallback, or base layer. This is the only method that will survive upgrades without data loss and make new features available to all.. Okay, I did that now. I still get strange messages:\nUnknown compiler version - please run the configure tests and report the results\nThis shows up after every file near the end. Then at the end comes this:\n```\nmsvc.archive ......\\bin.v2\\libs\\regex\\build\\msvc\\debug\\link-static\\runtime-link-static\\threading-multi\\libboost_regex-vc-mt-sgd-1_55.lib\n...updated 21 targets...\nNo correctly built boost regex libraries could be found.\nTry specifying the MSVC version on the command line.\nBoost is available free from www.boost.org\nUnzip the file downloaded from www.boost.org, and give the absolute path\nas the first parameter to buildboost.bat\ne.g.\nbuildboost.bat d:\\libs\\boost_1_48_0\nYou can specify which version of the Visual Studio compiler to use\nwith --toolset.\nUse:\n  --toolset msvc-8.0     for Visual studio 2005\n  --toolset msvc-9.0     for Visual Studio 2008\n  --toolset msvc-10.0    for Visual Studio 2010\n  --toolset msvc-11.0    for Visual Studio 2012\n  --toolset msvc-12.0    for Visual Studio 2013\ne.g.  To build with boost in d:\\libs\\boost_1_48_0 with Visual Studio 2008\n    buildboost.bat --toolset msvc-9.0 d:\\libs\\boost_1_48_0\n\n```\nDoes this mean it's failed or is everything good now?\n. As I continue with the next command, I get this:\nLINK : fatal error LNK1104: Datei \"libboost_regex-vc120-mt-s-1_55.lib\" kann nicht ge\u00f6ffnet werden.\nNMAKE : fatal error U1077: \"\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC\\BIN\\link.EXE\"\": R\u00fcckgabe-Code \"0x450\"\nStop.\nThis definitely looks like an error now. Could it be that the old Boost version isn't compatible with current tools and I really need the newer version?\n. No it's not there.\n. Okay, then I'm out. Maybe I'll know when 2015 is supported. I don't need this, I just thought I'd look into the most annoying bugs in Notepad++ and try to propose a fix myself. But building that biest seems more complicated than I have time for.\n. That's the point, I'm not going to install VS 2013 just for that. I have migrated everything else to VS 2015 (with very little effort) a few months ago and don't need older versions anymore.\nIt seems that Boost 1.58 can be made compatible with VS 2015. Not sure about 1.59. Maybe Notepad++ should just update their library references? There's even a VS 2015 solution/project file for NPP but it's not really useful if VS 2015 can't be used for its dependencies.\n. Wow, now tell me that C/C++ code is portable. It doesn't even compile in newer compiler versions. I've had this before in much simpler exercise code. I'll stay with C#.. Oops. Can somebody please forward this to their issue tracker? For mysterious reasons, my SourceForge accounts never last very long so I consider that ancient platform inaccessible and can't contribute there.\n. Are you still there? Please somebody simply click that button, no additional work required.\n. Works today. Must have been one of these random neutrinos.\n. It comes from the word wrap. Enable it and you can see it.\n. Correct, thanks.\n. Happened again now, v6.9.2.\n. And again, just a few minutes after. Something's wrong here.\n. Doesn't sound at all like the references you mentioned. I've had the issue a couple of times since my last report, most recently just now. It's still bugging me and I have to restart NPP to resolve it. Simply switching windows, either with Alt+Tab or by mouse interaction, is enough to run into this, it just takes a few days normal usage.\n. @MAPJe71 What does that comment mean?\n. > Notepad++ v6.9.2\n\nBuild time : May 18 2016 - 00:34:05\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10\nPlugins : mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll NppSaveAsAdmin.dll PluginManager.dll ScrollPastEOFUni.dll \n. The steps to reproduce don't work for me. When I come back to Notepad++, the file is automatically reloaded (as per my configuration, no confirmation dialog here) and the cursor continues to be correct everywhere. So this is not the issue I've reported. I still see my issue every once in a while. I'll try to click into the text area next time to see if that part helps for me.. No, I can't remember having seen that confirmation message in a long time. I rarely run into the situation that files are modified outside of Notepad++ in general.. What a hack that commit is. Side note: It will clear the text selection, if there is any.. You may chose not to reload the document in the dialog. The selection will now be cleared anyways. But I admit that this is probably one of the smaller issues this program has.. Just FYI, I just had that wrong mouse cursor again, with no unsaved or elsewhere modified documents or dialog boxes involved anywhere near. Just alt-tabbing back from the web browser. Clicking into the document area once did resolve it for me. Good to know there is such an easy workaround available.. I think I've found another way to reproduce:\n\n\nOpen a plain text document\nEnter a URL in the document\nDouble-click that URL to open it in a web browser\nAlt+Tab back to Notepad++\n\nNow the mouse cursor is flickering between default pointer and text input when hovering the entire window (except the editor area itself).\nClicking into the editor once restores normal mouse cursor appearance.. For the initial description of this issue, it is not fixed. I have just observed the very same effect again with version 7.3.3. So for the sake of correctness, and if you're willing to actually resolve this bug, please reopen the issue. The workaround of clicking into the editor once still works.\nUpdate 7 days later: And now again, this time after double-clicking a URL to open the web browser.\nUpdate 27 Jun: Happened again, still v7.3.3. Certainly nothing fixed here.. The issue itself is a duplicate but the solution is not. What should I do with a command line parameter? Nothing will ever specify that. It must be an option in the application itself to be useful.\n. I have indeed upgraded my computers to Windows 10 by now but the issue already existed on Windows 7 before. I don't think it's related to the Windows version, it should be purely application behaviour.\n. Where are they at home?. That file is gone after restarting Windows. Still with the old version. Is that a temporary file that is not backed to disk but only resides in memory?. Oh my, our administrator has inadvertently changed the CCleaner configuration and that tool wants to delete that file by default. Pretty aggressive.. This is probably related to #443.. I am well aware that development on this project has almost stopped. I just wanted to note it down here anyway so it won't be forgotten so easily.. I've updated my stylers.xml from the default generated file. That includes a lot more LexerType entries and if they're not there, they cannot be configured in the UI. This looks like a problem with the application upgrade strategy. Any new version of Notepad++ will not update this file so that new features are not available in old updated installations. And the built-it default seems to use unreadable colours, whereas the default stylers.xml file has readable colours set. This is why I reported this issue as unresolvable be the user (through the UI). The resolution involves patching a file in a hidden system directory. Is that what you recommend to users?\nI'm adding this to my repro steps:\n\nEdit your stylers.xml file to not include the STRINGRAW entries for any JavaScript section.\n. Yeah, that's not the problem. Any new style options should be available in the UI anyway, regardless of the contents of the user file, and then it should use the values from the template file. This doesn't seem to be the case.. In the news: https://www.heise.de/security/meldung/Opera-VLC-WinRAR-7-Zip-Skype-Tuerkischer-Provider-ersetzt-Downloads-durch-Spyware-3990285.html\n\nThis might affect Notepad++ as well. Or already have affected.. Now that the installer code signing is successfully removed, do we have secure update downloading, or is Notepad++ security now completely gone?! 2019 has knocked on the door and asked when you're coming.. Okay, so how can I uninstall it? Running the installer again and deselect the option doesn't help. What file do I have to delete?. Seems like a very inconsiderate plugin. I have solved this for me by unchecking the (initially collapsed) option from the Notepad++ installer for all new installs. Just like everyone has to manually select their localisation. But that's okay, it would only be disappointing to find an unpolished application behind a shining installer. \ud83d\ude44 I'm not expecting anything more.. ",

Ah... thanks for the hint with TGitCache.\nThey do it that way, that they only watch the base paths of the git directories recursively, and all other sub directories below the base directory are eveluated manually by the ReadDirectoryChangesW messages.\nThis could also be a good solution for Notepad++... only the directories manually added by the user would be locked, but everything below (the opened nodes) would be freely changeable. Sounds like a better solution than polling, I will check it on the weekend. Nevertheless, this comment I found in TGit makes me frown a bit:\n// NOTE: the longer this code takes to execute until ReadDirectoryChangesW\n// is called again, the higher the chance that we miss some\n// changes in the file system!\nI don't want to lose any change.\n. Thank you for the suggestions :)\nI have implemented them.\nIn ProjectPanel.cpp, I changed all LPARAM casts to be consistent there.\n@dail8859:\nPerhaps we should call it \"Monitored Directories\" just to clarify the difference to \"Folders\", which is indeed confusing now.\n. Thank you very much for your review, ariccio!\nAnd sorry for the huge amount of problems and for the late answer (got a lot of work to do, and I really underestimated this directory thing...)\nA lot of problems were caused by C&P from old code. As far as I can see e.g. the SendMessage() without checks is also done in the master branch all over the place in TreeView and ProjectPanel.\nAlso, there's also a lot of duplicated code in the master as well.\nI think it's the best way to rework these problems completely and consistently and place all of this duplicated code into some functions with checking.\nRegarding ReadDirectoryChanges I agree. It would be definitely better to use this, even if the directory will be locked (but not its sub directories). Nevertheless, I will first fix the problems mentioned here and then look into this.\n. OK, thanks for the hint. I have already begun with the changes, but I will wait until that then.\nIs there an estimation when this will be done?\n. No, these are not pure virtual, and the base class Directory is used in the code without being inherited.\n. This is just a way to overcome\n\"c4100 unreferenced formal parameter\".\nI prefer this way, since it clearly shows that this parameter is not used, without removing its meaning by removing the name from the parameter list.\nAnyway, I do not see the usefulness of this warning at all. It makes things far less readable without any real benefit (especially in optional virtual functions). I suggest to switch it off globally.\nBut of course this is not my project ;), I can change it to removing the name(s) from the parameter list(s), if you like this better.\n. Sorry, I don't completely understand... I clean up and do a rethrow at the end of the catch. Why is this not ok (all other exceptions, also those not from me, will be rethrown)?\n. I think because append() is called three times here and the return value would have to be or'ed each time, it's better to set the member variable. Additionally, it is a quick way to compare existing and non-existing directories, and can be accessed via getter.\n. Thanks, the check for INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE does indeed not make any sense, neither in the loop condition nor here, since it was already checked before the loop entrance. Will make this whole loop a do while.\nI don't think throwing is a good idea, since the only realistic reason, that FindClose() can fail, imho is a faulty handle, which would be caused by a previous error. So I think an assert(0) would be better here.\n. It has a clear benefit only when autoread is true, because there is also an expensive read() in this case. Will change it so, that the check is only performed on autoread.\n. I am not sure... agreed, that this change would be good, but TCHAR* const TCHAR* is used all over the source. \nImho it probably should be better consistent currently, and refactored in a separate commit for all occurrences?\n. It's not many filters, and they are small. But it is currently accessed often in DirectoryWatcher, so I tend to keep it as it is.\n. Oops... no. The assumption that this can not happen is wrong, because a file could be created between the 1st and 2nd iteration. I'll change the comment.\n. I have to confess that I am not really used to smart pointers.\nBut it seems to be a very good idea, because it also removes the necessity to manually keep track of the reference count, since it comes for free with shared_ptr.\nWill change it this way.\n.

Hi @donho and all,\nOk, I would suggest again a PR when I should add multiple Lexer.\nBut as Mr. @dail8859 says in issue #1258 \"Unfortunately adding a new lexer is a bit tedious, and every time a new lexer is added all other PRs for lexers need fixed because there will be merge conficts :(\"\n\"Usually about 10 files need modified. For example if you take a look here you can see this pending PR for adding Visual Prolog.\"\nThis PR was to simplify adding lexer and \"connect\" lexer already in Scintilla.\nUntil I create a new PR, can you add the following PR ? :\n- #1257 Adding Scintilla Lexer for motorola S-REC file, Intel Hex, and TEHEX\n- #1439 Adding Scintilla Lexer for VISUALPROLOG\n. @donho Thank you, PR updated. Sorry I had forgotten to change the size of the tables _langList and _lexerStylerArray (parameters.h)\nSince my PR other languages have been added. Now we have 82 (with \"Global Styles\" and \"Search result\"). \n==> I set the limit to 100 (80 previously, 82 now used)\nconst int MAX_LEXER_STYLE = 100;  // (80 previously)\nconst int NB_LANG = 100;                // (80 previously). I also have this error without my PR.\nThe problem comes from the parseCommandLine() function of the winmain.cpp :\n1) Line : TCHAR commandLine = new TCHAR[lstrlen(cmdLine)];\nshould be : TCHAR commandLine = new TCHAR[lstrlen(cmdLine)+1];\n2) Lines ++commandLine; modify commandLine value (pointeur adresse)\nand line delete commandLine_save; FAIL because pointeur value change by ++commandLine\nSee also : https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/b85930314847727ee8070d1417e674afd1bb24ab\nIs this problem you encounter?. Bonjour @donho en fait cela est assez complexe \nNormalement un fichier encod\u00e9 en UTF-16 little-endian commence par 0xFF 0xFE (appel\u00e9 BOM) mais dans le code mis en commentaire on essai d'identifier un fichier encod\u00e9 en UTF-16 little-endian m\u00eame s'il ne contient pas de BOM.\n2 cas sont possibles :\n      - si un fichier hexa est identifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tord comme UTF-16 LE without BOM alors il sera mal affich\u00e9 (comme on peut le voir dans #2692)\n        Remarque : si le fichier de #2692 est ouvert dans scintilla il est affich\u00e9 correctement.\n      - si le fichier est un vrai fichier \"UTF-16 without BOM\" il sera plus affich\u00e9 tel que...\nIl y a effectivement un choix \u00e0 faire.\nEn parcourant l'historique du code on peut aussi voir que ce pb est apparue pour \"try to detect UTF-16 big-endian without BOM\" ==> et le code a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en commentaire.\nPeut-\u00eatre qu'il faudrait modifier le code et proposer 2 options d\u00e9sactivables :\n     - try to detect UTF-16 big-endian without BOM\n     - try to detect UTF-16 big-little without BOM\n. Finalement il vaut mieux trouver une autre solution pour r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me #2692 et conserver le m\u00e9canisme actuelle de d\u00e9tection de UTF-16 big-little without BOM. I corrected my post. \n. @MAPJe71 yes is no compact menu (I edited the title). I try this but is not perfect : \nif (isFileExisting)\n{\n    PTSTR ext = PathFindExtension(buf->getFullPathName());\n\n    HRESULT hres;\n    wchar_t buffer[MAX_PATH] = TEXT(\"\");\n    DWORD bufferLen = MAX_PATH;\n\n    hres = AssocQueryString(NULL, ASSOCSTR_COMMAND, ext, NULL, buffer, &bufferLen);\n\n\n    bool enable= (hres == S_OK)                                // check no no association in Windows XP or other error\n        && (wcsstr(buffer, TEXT(\"OpenWith.exe\")) == NULL)  // check no no association in Windows 10\n        && (wcsstr(buffer, TEXT(\"OpenAs_RunDLL\")) == NULL) // check no association in Windows 7\n        && (wcsstr(buffer, TEXT(\"notepad++\")) == NULL);    // check association with notepad++\n\n    _tabPopupMenu.enableItem(IDM_FILE_OPEN_DEFAULT_VIEWER, enable);\n}\n\n\n\nWith file without association : \n\n\nWith Windows XP : \n\nhres != S_OK \n\n\n\nWith Windows 7  : \n\nhres == S_OK \nbuffer = C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\system32\\shell32.dll,OpenAs_RunDLL %1\n\n\n\nWith Windows 10 : \n\nhres == S_OK \nbuffer = C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\OpenWith.exe \"%1\" \n\n\n\nOther Windows : no tested\n\n\nNext  Windows : ?\n\n\nWith file associated with notepad++ : \n\nhres == S_OK \nbuffer = C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\NOTEPAD.EXE %1\n\n\n\nThis is not perfect because one does not know the syntax in the next Windows, and the Exe of Notepad ++ could change name\nWhat do you think ?. Thank you for your help. The option \"Open in Defaut Viewer\" is not enable if  defauft viewer is notepad++.exe...\nBut the code detect this only if exe is \"notepad++.exe\" (or xxxxxxnotepad++.exe) not \"Notepad++.Win32.Unicode Release.exe\" :-(\nThis improvement can be done later\n. Hi,\n\nI manually renamed my configured stylers.xml to include backup...\n\nTo do also with the file langs.xml\n.reg file use now registry language. Hi,\nTest file is read with \"OEM 855\" encoding file (detect by notepad++). \n\nI noticed that Hex editor works fine if the encoding detected by notepad++  is: \n ANSI\n UTF-8\n UTF-8 BOM\n UCS-2 BE BOM\n* UCS-2 LE BOM\nnot OK with UCS2-BE (without BOM), and other (OEM 855)\nI try reload test file with ANSI encoding : Encoding >> Encode in ANSI but without success\nhttp://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/Convert_Or_Encode%3F\nThe option Encode in .... OR Character sets / .... / ...., apply the chosen encoding to the actual contents of the current file. \n. Hi,\ntry this :\nYou can disable autodetect character encoding:\npreferences >> MISC >> disable the Autodetect character encoding\nOpen test file : \nnow is open with ANSI encode and Hex editor display correct '\\x9c\\xa6\\xbf\\xd8'\n.

    "MarkMaldaba": "This is a regression, not an enhancement.  Old versions of Notepad++ (e.g. 6.2.1) would open with \"new 1\".  In the latest version (6.7.9.2) it opens with \"new 0\".  There was obviously a regression introduced somewhere between those two versions.  \"new 1\" is the correct numbering for humans,\n. I'm not sure that the definition of bug is that it stops the product from working (unless by 'not working' you mean 'exhibits incorrect behaviour', in which case that is exactly what is happening here), but either way I agree that 'regression' is a more appropriate label.\n. In reply to @donho \n\nWhat I will accept is a pr fixes the first situation, but not insert the regression.\n\nIn my opinion \"New 2\" when opening a second document is much less of an issue than \"New 0\" whenever you open Notepad++.  The latter will be seen by all users whenever they open the application, and just looks broken.  The former can sort of be justified (there is already a document open, so this is number 2) and is only seen by people who start a new document from within Notepad++ (which is still a lot of people, but fewer).\nObviously, best result is to fix both situations, but I would rather revert to the least-worse scenario if that is going to take a long time.  The original 'fix' that broke the latter issue is actually the thing that should be reverted for having introduced a regression - this PR should be considered as fixing a regression, not introducing one!\n. That doesn't help with the fact that auto-backup and auto-save-on-close are broken once a second NP++ instance has been opened.\n(Also, I haven't tested it, but how does \"Explorer\" cope with multiple NP++ instances being open at the same time?  Do sessions saved in one instance show up in the other, or do they wipe each other's configuration as per the problem described here?)\n. > My tip not solve multi-instance problem. Npp don't support this. Sessions feature\n\nis a way to not need multi-instance.\n\nSo long as NP++ supports both sessions and multi-instance, then they should work nicely together.  Using one NP++ feature should not break another!\n. For reference, this was removed in 0746d1f4f717dea6c080785725b7de2b25cf8981, with little explanation.  Hopefully it should simply be a matter of reverting that commit.. @donho Any thoughts on this?  We are currently unable to upgrade NP++ at our organisation due to this issue.. @donho What is the status of this?  Is it on the roadmap somewhere, or is it something that you do not plan to fix?\nThe simplest way of implementing this is probably a good compromise, too;  it means there is still no burden of maintenance for the external config.model.xml within the project, but restores the utility of this file for automated custom deployments:\n\nInitialise the config variables internally from within the code (as currently happens)\n[new bit] If there exists a config.model.xml in the Notepad++ directory, load it using exactly the same logic as the main config.xml is loaded.\nLoad config.xml (as currently happens)\n\nIs this something you would consider adding to the next release?. Thanks, @sasumner.  There are some interesting attempts at a workaround there, but there wasn't a full resolution to the issue.\nFrom that thread, it appears this might be something that needs to be resolved upstream (in Scintilla) before it can be resolved here.. > I just reread all of that thread. \nMe too.  As you say - phew! :-)\nThe Python script still adds noise by showing characters for all white-space (apart from leading indentation).  If it's subtle enough for that not to be really annoying, then it's probably too subtle to draw attention where it matters.\nI was thinking of a something more like this:\n\n\nAnother suggestion: Can't you set your version control software to refuse commits that don't meet your criterion (trailing ws in this case)?\n\nTechnically, yes.  But our policy is not to reject good commits based on code-styling issues as it is too disruptive and in our company we prefer the carrot to the stick.  This kind of thing is better handled by post-commit review and automated tools, like CodeSniffer.\n. > I don't really understand this comment. \nThese comments are based on the example from the other thread:\n\nAs you can see, there are no markers at the start of the line, but there are markers in between words and they use the same styling as the white-space markers at the end of this line.  In that context, I can't see how you could style the comment markers so that the ones at the end of the line are prominent enough to be useful without over-emphasising the irrelevant inter-line markers.\nYour example shows a distinction between end-of-line whitespace and inter-line white-space which looks like it resolves this.  We could probably set the standard marker to white to stop it showing, which would be getting close to a viable workaround for this issue.\nI'd still be interested for NP++/Scintilla to provide native support for this, to avoid the additional dependencies and the need to set it up and configure it on every machine and also to avoid the shortcomings of this solution, e.g. that on those occasions where you do want to see the white-space markers you have to dig into the styler and mess around with colours, rather than just toggling them on/off, and also for the current line (which is non-white) the markers would still be faintly visible..

In one row they look normal, but this button style doesn't look as part of Notepad++ UI design. If it possible to look 'normal' (as normal I mean how it looks in previous multi-line versions) in one and 2+ rows will be great. Thanks for your work and PR, but I'm not a programmer and don't know how to compile for myself without installing tons of gigabytes of Visual Studio just for tests.. @AngryGamer Thank you, this is more usefull. I can reorder the buttons with Shift+Mouse wheel, but when I use Ctrl+MW or Ctrl+Shift+MW there is something like 'pulsation' of all buttons, with mouse clicks it's OK. So for me as functionality it is good. I hope that the button style UI can be fixed as original tab style UI. . @AngryGamer the last one looks good, it's less obtrusive like a colors in flat Windows8+, but I think for this:\n\n\nI make it in GIMP and don't know how it look in Windows8+. With this button style there is a moment of \"WTF is this pressed button, where are my tabs?!?\". I hope you or somebody else can understand me how I want to looks the \"new\" style - It's just about the old good one, with old good tabs, nothing more. But let other users say what they want.. @esrat You welcome. The reordering is fixed, but we will see that in the next version, or you can compile N++ for yourself. I hope that the real tabs will be also fixed... . As a user, I don't like this way of tab reordering - If I want to reorder some tabs, I must to disable multi-line, to reorder them and after that to enable multi-line again if I want to have fast access to them?!? What about if I have 50 tabs and want No.38 to be No.8?. @AngryGamer Nice job, thank you very much. There is one little thing: It's possible to reorder only the active tab, if I want to move any other I must click once to make it active and 2nd click for move, i.e. it's not activate automatically.. Just perfect, I think that at this point we have fully worked multi-line fix. Thanks. You have projects in View > Project but I'm not sure is that the answer for your feature request.. There is a way to open all files from folder, but this will not loading it in the 'Folder as Workspace'.

The 2nd update for preference.rc is MISC. reordering from the current state of master branch. But why, @donho ? There is \"free\" pixels for this and I didn't change the border, I'm in it. This is very ugly to have short translation, when you can have full translation. Did you see the screens from #3058 ?. You can use the Dock button on the top right corner. ALT + Mouse Selection means that firstly you must press and hold down the ALT key and then make a desired selection with the left mouse button. Also you can use Alt + Shift + Mouse Selection. The Alt + Shift + Arrow key is the same - press and hold down Alt key then press and hold down Shift key and then play with the Arrow keys. And yes, sometimes in bigger selections is difficult to use key combinations. May be the button for activate/deactivate the Column mode will be good.. Glad to read that it's working. For arrow key combo you can check the Shortcut Mapper... in Settings for duplicate shortcuts or something else. Or you have a hardware problem.... You are probably right. I make some tests and at this point the results are:\nr\\\n\nr\\n\\\n\n&#x0A;\n\n. The solution for now is to replace \\r with &#x0A;. See #3280.

I also sorely miss this feature.\nIt seems like there are two bugs for this though. Either this or #1974 should be set as a duplicate.. What's the point of setting a hotkey if it's not permanent? Today I noticed that it was reset to ctrl+alt+s again.. @cmeriaux commented on 2018. febr. 9. 07:19 CET:\n\nyour environment may be corrupted. you may tray a fresh install.\n\nI doubt it. All my other settings persist. But it comes to me now that I recently upgraded NP++, so I looked into that.\nIt seems like an NP++ design flaw. I see now that there's a shortcuts.xml included with the NPP 7z/zip package and even the installer. So every time someone upgrades the shortcuts are overwritten. Other config files seem to be generated as they are needed or they have a \".model\" extension file with default values, so why not this?\n(there a bunch of them: config.xml, langs.xml, session.xml, stylers.xml). @cmeriaux commented on 2018. febr. 9. 17:50 CET:\n\nI can't reproduce your problem. Try with the portable version.\n\nWhat do you mean you can't reproduce it? You look into the 7z package and you see \"shortcuts.xml\".\nAs such when you unpack onto the local version it will overwrite custom hotkeys. @cmeriaux commented on 2018. febr. 9. 18:57 CET:\n\n\nI set \"Save As\" to Ctrl+Shift+S several times but, it always resets to default after some time. Not sure what causes it.\n\nI can't reproduce this issue mentionned.\nCheck out this doc :  \nhttp://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/Configuration_Files\nI'm pretty sure you missed something obvious.\nLike I said, try to reproduce the problem you mentionned at the top with the portable edition.\n\nIf by portable you meant the 7z/zip archived packages, then that's what I've been using all along. (Otherwise there's no package explicitly called portable)\nI'm quite sure it's not me who's missing the obvious. Is I said the package has the hotkeys file with default values, which always overwrites the customized one, when one unpacks its content. What's so incomprehensible about this?\nIt's clearly the file being used:\n\n(also there's nothing in appdata, so NP++ doesn't keep config files there with the 7z version.)\nIt takes one second to look into the official 7z package to verify this.\n. @cmeriaux commented on 2018. febr. 10. 11:27 CET:\n\nChill out, I'm trying to help you.\n\n\nSorry. I loose my patience when I have to reiterate something a second time.\n\nSo npp store every custom parameters locally (due to file doLocalConf.xml). when unzipping a new package, your custom parameters are lost. This is not a bug, this is the normal behavior.\n\nI'd argue that it's a design flaw. How can it be normal when all other config files are void of this issue? Either they're created by NP++ on runtime or are added with a model suffix, stylers.model.xml.\nI also see that the shortcuts.xml is created automatically if I have it removed and change a shortcut.\nSo is it even necessary at all to have a shortcuts.xml by default? Only a few shortcuts are in it in the  section, which I can't see why couldn't be hard coded as all the other default shortcuts.\nEven if it is necessary for some reason I can't see to have the file, why not have a shortcuts.model.xml with default data instead? That way the user modified shortcuts wouldn't get overwritten.\nHonestly this feels like that shortcuts.xml was just forgotten to be dealt with in an appropriate matter.\nAlso, how else would someone update a portable instance than unpacking the files from the newer version and overwriting the old files?. @cmeriaux commented on 2018. febr. 10. 13:18 CET:\n\nyou may be right. You can correct it and submit a Pull Request. In the mean time, you should consider using   one of the 2 suggestion I've made.\n\nI would if I could. :) I hope someone will get to it sometime.. @MAPJe71 commented on 2018. febr. 10. 14:06 CET:\n\n\nAlso, how else would someone update a portable instance than unpacking the files from the newer version and overwriting the old files?\n\nI use a diff/merge tool to compare and merge the contents of the installed version and the zip archive of the new version.\n\nHow does that help? You still have to know what files can and can't be overwritten. An still have to know why the extra files in the installed version are present. Any number of updated files might have changed between versions.\nI think until this is fixed I'll set file permissions to prevent the accidentally overwriting the hotkeys file.. @CookiePLMonster commented on 2018. febr. 10. 15:10 CET:\n\nAs far as I understand, \"portable\" applications should be used for quick, \"stateless\" editing sessions. \n\nI'd say that's just a use-case.. I updated the title to so that it describes the actual issue.\n@donho \nCan this be fixed? I really think this is a flaw. Because, unlike shortcuts.xml all other configuration files are either generated by the program, or supplied with .model suffix containing default values, so as to not overwrite configurations. It looks like the shortcuts file was simply forgotten, and not dealt with in a similar fashion.. That's not quite true. Syntax coloring includes highlighting for a few things, which is is gone when I change the background color. This option should only change the default background/foreground (white/black) color.\nFor example:\n \n. @dail8859 commented on 2018. jan. 25. 21:21 CET:\n\nCan you provide exact steps with specific instances (e.g. code) that it doesn't work for you? And also post your debug information?\n\n\nThat is what the pictures are about...\nWatch for the highlights, that are removed when I changed the background color to a darker one. \"@param\" part in the first one, and stuff between %-s in the second.\nJudging by stylers.xml it's quite common to have syntax based highlights.\n. @dail8859 commented on 2018. jan. 25. 21:21 CET:\n\nAnd also post your debug information?\n\nIt's of nor relevance, but here:\nNotepad++ v7.5.4   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Jan  1 2018 - 01:47:45\nPath : D:\\Programok\\Notepad Plus\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : ON\nOS : Windows 8.1 (64-bit)\nPlugins : ComparePlugin.dll DSpellCheck.dll jN.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll NppFTP.dll NppTextFX.dll PluginManager.dll SelectNLaunch.dll SpellChecker.dll\n. @dail8859 commented on 2018. jan. 25. 21:48 CET:\n\n\nWatch for the highlights\n\nWell if you are overriding the background color then the background color will get changed.\n\n\nWell this was the point of the issue. That NPP wouldn't do this. Just set the color to the specified color, then apply the syntax coloring.\n(Though I see a complication with this. For some languages such JS and PHP the default background color seems to have been changed without any relevance for syntax for some reason as such they'd require special treatment)\n\n\nIt's not of any relevance, but here:\n\nYou'd be surprised that some people are on a 2 year old version of N++ and submit bugs. That's why this is requested in the issue template.\n\nMust have missed it.. @dail8859 commented on 2018. jan. 25. 22:10 CET:\n\n\nJust set the color to the specified color, then apply the syntax coloring.\n\nUnfortunately it is not as simple as \"draw the background color\" and then \"draw the syntax coloring on top\". Each syntax style has its own configurable background color. \n\nWell, if this would be the case it would actually make it simpler. Just change the default color and be done with it.\nBut it seems to me that every element has the background colour specified in JS. (I had to change all of them to get a typical white  background for JS, when I tested.)\n. @sasumner commented on 2018. szept. 9. 15:15 CEST:\n\nCan you show what your settings are in Settings (menu) -> Preferences... -> Backup\n\nYes:\n\nSo, maybe one of these settings changed erroneously?. @sasumner commented on 2018. szept. 9. 16:21 CEST:\n\nYes, with those settings you WILL get a .bak file in the same folder for every file you change and save with Notepad++.

Having the lines constantly changing makes it harder for me to get used to where to look for my documents when I go to click on them, for example. If documents could stay in a specific line, I think that would be better UX.\nAlso this behavior causes issues like #917, although I would assume that this could be fixed without removing the behavior.\nThanks!\n.

Perhaps you could do a 'Find All' before the 'Replace in Files' to verify you won't be replacing in any files you know are binary\n2. Or you could create a filter for the files that you do want to modify (e.g. .html;.htm;*.css) .

You can ask for help with doing that here. \n. I think mikefitz's suggestion (working backwards from end of file) is your best bet. \n\nAnd I think the \"find\" bug can be fixed in a minute.\n\nIn my mind, to implement the behavior you are requesting you would have to update the 'find result' data structure on every SCN_MODIFIED or SCN_CHARADDED event, and I doubt that operation could be done quickly enough to not cause problems.  \n\nMy thought is that all issues I might find has been reported earlier ?\n\nMaybe, maybe not.

GetCursorPos(&p) gets the current position of the mouse cursor, and not the position of the selected treeview item.

As far as I can tell there, there is only one 1-line change between the two version. \nCan anyone else confirm its not working on 7.5.2?. I wouldn't be surprised if this was an issue with XP.... @sasumner, I think you confused the comment @MAPJe71 made with the one @sorein did. MAPJe71 is talking about 'instances' which is what I believe sorein means when he says 'windows'. \n'Instances' is probably the term we should be using here, since that is the word used internally by Notepad++ (e.g. right click a tab, and you can see \"Move to new instance\"). \nI think what sorein reported is adequately being described by MAPJe71 (i.e. session files only save info on the current 'instance' being closed)\n. @sasumner, DOH, you're right. I misread you. I thought you were attributing the \"instance\" comment to sorein.... I was just trying to deescalate the thread a bit. I recognize and appreciate your contributions here on github and on the community forums. \n@sorein, your second post may come off as a little condescending, so I'd suggest employing a little more humility. You may also consider editing your original post to be a little more precise (e.g. under expected behavior, 3+3 != 7), and to use the Notepad++ nomenclature. My understanding is that Notepad++ has two views (the left and right pane in the editor), and each of these views can have multiple tabs. Notepad++ can also be run in multi-instance mode, which creates a new \"window\" with its own views & tabs. \nMy memory may be failing, but it seems like this issue has been reported before... Is there previous issue # we can tie this one to?. @KhunRoger I would agree that the first click to regain focus shouldn't affect any options. \nHowever, toggling checkboxes/radio buttons by clicking on their label is pretty much a UI best practice. \n. . is a greedy quantifier, which means it does exactly what you are seeing.... \nyou probably want to use a lazy quantifier: .?\n. @IEales  Also, I'm not sure if you are escaping your parenthesis. \nTo match (Dana Andrews) and (Lloyd Bridges), I had to use the expression:\n\\(.*?\\). I'd maybe describe this as \"Notepad++ does not properly count empty lines when regex \"^$\" is used.\"\nIn my testing, the lines are found (with 'Find Next' or 'Find All'), they just are not counted (when clicking on the 'Count' button). \nAs a possible workaround @martinrotter, you could click 'Find All in Current Document', and then the results window will have the count. e.g. 'n hits in 1 file'. @andreszs do you have a link to a specific thread where this is discussed? Are you referring to \"Feature request: enable key bindings without modifier keys\"? \nI'm just wondering if that is your opinion or if @donho has stated as much.... @passboltUser, the issue has been fixed in version 3.7.5 of the underlying scintilla component, and it looks like Don Ho has committed to pulling in this version to a future Notepad++ release. . @martinalcock @sasumner \nOn windows 8 I can reproduce part of this issue, i.e. when I do file->open, the file type shows \"*.txt\", but it displays all files. However, when its in this state and I click on a file of type other than text, Notepad++ opens it just fine. \nSo to me, I appears like there is a bug, where Notepad++ does not correctly filter the file types when you first open the \"Open file dialog\"\n\n. @alongL, if you search the existing issues you will find other people thinking the UI should be improved: #622 #972 #3828 Also, there is this long thread over on the support forums. \nI'd recommend adding your suggestions to the thread on the support forums, or even better, implement you improvement and submit a pull request. . Yeah, I'll echo sasumner here. \nYou seem to be asking for RE support in the UDL dialog, but you lost me with \"XML contains the name of the syntax in which a regular expression is associated with a display style. On the \u201cMark\u201d tab is a combo with a selection of names.\". @pdanielewski1, what you are requesting can be done using the \"Regular Expression\" search mode . . Ctrl-Shift+Left/Right is working as expected for me (using 32-bit N++). \nWhat it selects is based on the defined \"word\" characters though. \nSo if you ctrl-shift select on \"Shift+ctrl+left/right\" it won't select the entire string, since + and / are \"word\" delimiters. \n@tippenring Is that whats causing the issue you are seeing?\n. @talentlessguy, I appreciate your ideas, and mockups. However, to me it seems like the consensus on that community thread is, \"meh... the current UI works and doesn't suffer some of the drawbacks of a flat/ribbon UI\". \nThere is also the problem that a UI refresh is kind of a massive undertaking, and unless you are willing to put in a lot of that work yourself, its probably not going to get done. \nI like your Split Up/Down/Right/Left right click options though, and think it might get some traction. The project panel is one area that could use some improvement. Maybe you could submit a feature request for just that part?\nAlso, what do you mean by \"4. Make plugins more interactive\"?\n. @RofWh00, it is probably one of your plugins causing this error. I'd suggest disabling them all and seeing if you can still reproduce the error. If you can't then try adding them back in one at a time until you can reproduce it again. I'd suggest starting with NppInfSearch, as it sounds like the most likely culprit. . @nelsontx I think the Compare plugin may do what you require, since it highlights character differences.\n. I'm skeptical of its utility. I'm having trouble thinking of a case where using \"blink compare\" would be easier than a \"traditional compare\". With blink compare you kinda have to constantly flip back and forth while scanning the whole page for differences. With traditional compare, those differences are already highlighted for you. \nI also see a problem with keeping the views synchronized. How would you want to handle added or removed lines in the two views?   . There needs to be some kind of syncing, otherwise you go to page 2 on your first document, and your second document is still on page 1... then all you see is changes. \nYou run into a similar problem with added/removed lines. Say you're looking at line 1000 in document one, but your second document has 50 lines removed somewhere before line 1000. You can't just blink to line 1000 in document two because the two views will look completely different... and you won't know which document has added or removed lines. \nSo this feature would need to have some kind of syncing, otherwise your two views have no similarities and they become useless for detecting changes.\n. Due to the fact that even a regular compare is not included in Notepad++, I doubt that this feature would ever get accepted. \n@nelsontx, I'd recommend making this feature request to the Compare Plugin project (linked above), . @Bartuzen I feel like the title doesn't explain it all. I did a few minutes of research and am kinda confused why you'd like to include an API designed for games into a text editor. \nMaybe you can tell us briefly what \"Discord Rich Presence\" is... or\nWhat Discord Rich Presence  features do you want to access in Notepad++\n. \n@Bartuzen, I know discord is a voice chat server mostly used for gaming. I've used it before, but I still don't know why you would want to integrate it into Notepad++. Can you please give us a use case for how you would like to use rich presence in Notepad++?\nAlso your imgur link appears broken...  and wtf does this mean:\n\nHere is a few example of 298732173129 \n\n. @Bartuzen, ok I am able to open the link now, and I can kinda see how this could be useful for remote pair programming. \nHowever, if you can't even take 5-10 minutes to articulate what your requested feature does, or why it would be useful. then how can ask someone to spend 5-10 hours implementing it?. @mach0gr, can you post your debug info? (In Notepad++ its located under the '?' menu) \nI don't think Notepad++ is related to Viber at all... and since Viber is a free, closed-source messaging app, its most definitely spying on you. Maybe it has a file lock on one of Notepad++'s configuration files? Have you ever shared a file in Viber that you have worked on in Notepad++?\nAlso, Microsoft's Process Monitor is going to give you the a much better view of whats going on. \n. @Aidolii, that page hasn't been updated since 2014.... and the last update to the wiki was in 1/2015. I've tried to register to edit pages, but have been unable to find a way to do so. As far as I can tell the wiki is read-only now. \n@sasumner, do you know of a way to update the wiki? Or maybe @donho can chime in?. @sasumner, don't sell yourself short... knowledge is power, and you have considerable knowledge about the N++ ecosystem. I figured if anyone knew it'd be you. \nLooking at the wiki history, people other than @donho have contributed, so there was probably a registration option at one point. I'm hoping Don can tell us what happened to that place. I know myself and others would help update it if given the opportunity. . @Davidebyzero, I have a similar situation where the files I am working on are modified by an external script, and nuking the undo buffer his bitten me also. \nThis would be an incredibly nice enhancement in my opinion. \n. @Davidebyzero, I agree that this should be a small change and that it would help prevent data loss.\n. @Ola-Ponny, is what you are trying to do is get Notepad++ to make your functions' names bold and blue? \nI tried modifying PHP.xml, and it would autocomplete my new entry, but it wouldn't bold/blue it. I think the keywords N++ bolds/blues are defined internally by Scintilla's lexer, and isn't user configurable in Notepad++.  When I changed the ABS entry in PHP.XML to ABS2, typing 'A' presented the ABS2 autocomplete option and not ABS. However it didn't bold/blue ABS2, while it did still bold/blue for ABS. \np.s. One thing I discovered is that any malformed XML is silently ignored by Notepad++.  So if it appears like N++isn't loading your file, run it through a linter. . > And thinking further about it, how would Notepad++ automatically know to load MyLib.xml anyway? Surely I must tell it somehow that this is what I want? Or is it supposed to parse all files in that dir? Not trying to be rude, but please re-read my post as I feel that we may be talking about slightly different things. (As often is the case when I interact with humans.)\nNotepad++ doesn't know to load MyLib.xml. It loads whatever xml file it needs to based on what language is selected. If you want it to read MyLib.xml, you'll need to create your own language (Menu->Language->Define your language...' and then save that UDL as \"MyLib\". \nI don't think this is what you really want though, because if you choose your \"MyLib\" langauge then you lose the coloring/folding that the PHP lexer provides. So you would need to add your custom keywords into php.xml. \nWhen I tested this though, my modified/custom keywords in php.xml did not get colored the same as other PHP reserved words... so this led me to believe that Scintilla's PHP lexer has its own keyword list it uses to apply the blue/bold style. \n\nI have also noticed that no matter how well the text looks in the file, and no matter what encoding I specify/use, any \"special\" chars are garbled in the Notepad++ list of autocomplete suggestions... \n\nI doubt you'll be able to use anything other than standard ASCII characters, unfortunately. \n\nI apologize in advance if I sound rude. I'm just incredibly frustrated and tired of undocumented nonsense and have wasted so many hours of my life on this specific problem.\n\nNah, you didn't come off sounding rude. I've implemented my own franken-lexer using UDL/pythonscript, and I've felt the same frustration you are feeling. I'm still frustrated at the lack of documentation and the locked/dead wiki. \nThe pythonscript plugin does a good job of filling in the gaps of Notepad++'s functionality. It might be the best route to achieve what your trying to do. If you'd like help, hop on over to https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/ \n. I'm pretty sure that N++'s XML parser doesn't handle non-ASCII characters, so updating config files isn't going to work for you. \nI have to plug PythonScript again. It handles UTF-8 characters, so it will be able to find and style your function declarations. . @Ola-Ponny, see this thread for some information on why this isn't working. My understanding, is that you can modify php.xml to add function names to the keyword autocomplete list, but they won't be styled and you won't be able to use non-ASCII characters. Since you function names contain non-ASCII characters, even if you could get custom PHP keywords to be styled properly, it won't do any good because your non-ASCII characters would break it. \nAnd like @sasumner mentioned, if you have any non-ASCII characters in your username (and hence %APPDATA% path), then \"fun\" unexpected things are likely to happen. \n. Very strange...  I'm seeing this on 7.5.9 also. \n@jdbaker, why did you close this issue?\n. I'm with sasumner on this one. Its working as expected and like every other text editor I've seen. I think the confusion comes from the default behavior of insert mode, where the vertical bar is in between columns. It becomes much clearer if you drop into overwrite mode (by toggling the Insert key). There is no ambiguity of which column your cursor is in when you're in overwrite mode. . @dave47 \nAre you installing manually or through the plugin manager? \nDo you see any error messages or pop-ups?\nWhere is your debug information? (Notepad++->Menu->?->Debug Info...). @sasumner  Well...  I'm still using Plugin Manager (on 7.5.9) . I might not be the only one. :/\nI just feel like @dave47 didn't really give us enough information to do anything with this issue. \n. @sasumner, I probably wouldn't have but the customize toolbar misbehaved for me this week causing me to remove it.  (it filled my toolbar up with non-responsive buttons)\nMy thinking was maybe this issue is related and wanted to get more details from @dave47 about what he was seeing. . Its working correctly now, good job @luisffranca !\nMy only suggestion would be to change the offset a bit so the apps menu doesn't entirely obscure the selected item:\nshowContextMenuFromMenuKey(selectedItem, (selectedItemRect.left+selectedItemRect.right)/2, (selectedItemRect.top+ selectedItemRect.bottom)/2);\n.

    "CookiePLMonster": "After all these years, confirmed still happening with 7.5.4. Looks like a nasty issue, for me it hung after minimizing and maximizing again.\nShouldn't Notepad++ just notify that file is not available anymore, as if it was deleted?\nEDIT:\nActually it does notify, but seems to have a huge timeout on that - and after the prompt showed, it froze again before I could take any action.. Seems to be solved by now.... Since, as stated, it seems to be standard Windows behaviour, I am bumping it and voting for closing the issue. With 2.000+ open issues in the project, things like this should really go since they are technically invalid for years by now.. It's mid-2018, this issue is still open and this line has been modified since.\nCan anybody close it as resolved?. It's an old issue, but I assume it's still a thing? As of February 2018, SHGetSpecialFolderLocation is still in use and pidl is still not being freed. Plus it has that dreaded MAX_PATH arbitrary limit.. This is in place for a very long time. Please close.. Fixed by #4925. This was accepted the same day it was submitted, yet as of Oct 2018 MessageBoxEx is nowhere to be found in n++ code... meh.\nAnd yes, this was not fixed in another way - Yes/No/Cancel still use OS localization.. Still open, still fixed \ud83d\ude06 Anyone to close it?. I have implemented this as a -z command line argument in #4620!. Yes, that is the intent. If it does not work like this (unlikely), it's a bug.. Notes taken.\nI saw the \"ninja\" post though - it's not a nice way to bump your issue if you ask me. If you're this desperate on seeing it fixed, you could attempt to do it yourself - that's what open source is about, technically.. Long time fixed. @donho can you please close?. Can you form it into a proper issue report? When posted this way it's very unlikely somebody will a) notice it b) take their time to verify it.. #215 is fixed, several \"wrong encoding detected\" issues have also been tackled since. @donho can we have it closed?. Cannot reproduce anymore. @donho - close?. Awesome! I should have tested more before saying I can't reproduce :/. Responding so I can track this easier.\n(as far as I know, no updates on this yet). I spent some time investigating it and came to the conclusion this functionality is terribly broken. The things you see \"leaking\" to the other virtual desktop are child dialogs and looks like this is either not permitted or flat out broken. I spent several hours trying to fix this but I still have no ideas. Feels like this approach is wrong to begin with.. I tried a few approaches and could not come with anything bugless and with equivalent feature level. I am sure there is a way to work it around somehow, but I haven't gotten to that yet.\nFrankly, the entire Document Map (and other dockable dialogs) are horrible... they take a few seconds to redraw each time after you drag them etc. - I managed to fix this specific error, but all the other ones (excluding the reported one) still persist. Ehh.. Not sure if you are still going to read this... but I'd say it's always worth tryign to get info about an RCE, so worth a try.\nIf you think it's severe, have you tried sending @donho an e-mail directly? Disclosing such issues in public may not be the best idea indeed, especially if you think it can be problematic.. As far as I understand, \"portable\" applications should be used for quick, \"stateless\" editing sessions. If you have your settings you can't afford losing, just switch to an installer version.. Naming convention issues aside, I don't see why this is rejected. While changes are quite substantial, they are easy to review and thus risk of regressions is low.\nIf anything, this PR is very likely to uncover issues caused by weak typing.. How would one proceed into reproducing this? Any quick, reliable way to come up with a file which can be opened, but not read?. Still present in 7.5.4. The window is leaving marks on the parent window (like dragging windows did on pre-Vista when the window was frozen...) and it feels like it can't keep up with movements...\nReplying so I can track this issue easier, as it may be worth investigating.. Should be fixed with #4077. Fixed by 46d0f12c3e687c83efbaa04f7ebd95616678226c. Sounds like a good candidate to use Thread Pools:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686766(v=vs.85).aspx\nMain point towards using them would be high level of abstraction - no need to manage threads manually nor even care how many of them are going to be utilized - just split the task into jobs, schedule them and let the OS decide how many threads to involve.\nSadly, thread pools are only available since Windows Vista. Worst case, we'd fall back to synchronous (existing) code on XP?. This particular issue is fixed when uchardet is updated! . Fixed by #4925. Is this still an issue with v7.5.4? Your file works fine there.. Here's how Visual Studio Code solves this problem:\n\n\nIf folder is named differently.\n\nIf folder is named the same.\nIt would be very much welcome to see similar functionality in Notepad++.. Confirmed still happening in v7.5.4. Visual Studio Code handles those filenames correctly (opens two tabs), so it is possible to fix that.. Relevant:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/42916876/microsofts-implementation-of-lstrcmpi-and-unicode-characters\nLooks like notepad++ determines this behaviour by comparing filenames linguistically, which doesn't seem to be a correct behaviour in this context.\nAlso this:\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/greggm/2005/09/22/dont-compare-file-names/. They are not the same though - they look the same but they are not identical. Try copypasting the two example file names from the issue report and you'll notice you can have both next to each other, but notepad++ treats them as if they had the same name.. Honestly, I don't know. I copied file names from here and the fact Windows allowed me to create those two and vscode handled them fine was enough reasons so look into it IMO.. It works fine but introduces an incosistency.\nIf you check a file from #4079, opening it makes n++ report file encoding as \"UCS-2 Little Endian\" - however clicking \"Encode in UTF-16 LE BOM\" changes this encoding and there is no way to go back to the original encoding.. Fixed via #3870. Issue still present in 7.5.2. Submitted PR still seems to be valid.. Still present in 7.5.3.. I know, I'm bumping this mostly because of a ready PR with a bugfix. Not like it's up for grabs - it's fixed and waiting for a merge.. Updated to correct buffer size again - for Normal mode replacements linebuf included space for comments (usually 2 or 3 characters) while it did not need to since linebuf only ever stores a raw text line, without adding any extra tags to it.\nSo turns out Advanced mode allocated too little memory, whereas Normal mode allocated... too much =)\nEDIT:\nAs for the fix, since both concern the same line I guess it'd be better to squash it while merging... not sure if GitHub allows that though.. I have squashed both commits to conform with contributing guidelines more - and since both affect the same line the end result is objectively cleaner.. Making advantage of the burst of activity to attempt to bump this. @donho . Attempting to bump it - since it's fairly relevant, leaks in Shell are very nasty.. Is this ever going to be corrected? It's an useful feature, would be a shame to see this PR being left to rot.. Since you mentioned ANSI files not showing as UTF-8, #4124 possibly fixed it.. But only if they don't have UTF-8 characters in them, I guess? If you try to saving for example with this\n\u0104\nthen it should be detected as UTF-8 fine.. Ah! Then it's related to several issues: #675, #671, #813 and #4056 - and maybe more.. Are you sure this is the exact repro path? I generated a text file consisting of 200000 random ASCII characters and a newline - and my v7.5.3 opens it instantly. Same with v7.5.4.. Ouch, haven't noticed your pull request before submitting #4077... not sure what to do now, since I also corrected detecting encoding on reload (so default encoding for ANSI files is respected when reloading) :/\nI can close my PR if there is a fix for #2843 out there somewhere - and since nobody mentioned it in the issue, I don't think there is.. That's cool then =) I guess if your PR gets merged first then mine will throw some merge issues, which actually won't be merge issues (as it's 1:1 code), and thus both can work together just fine.. VS2015 is supported since a while - but boost 1.55.0 is too old to support it. 1.66.0 supports even VS2017.\nBoost's primary test compilers are:\nVisual C++: 7.1, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 14.0, 14.1. MAX_PATH in this place looks wrong and completely arbitrary. You'd probably be way better off either:\n\nusing a string class (whatever n++ prefers, looks like generic_string is the way to go)\ndoing strlen and allocating memory dynamically\n\nI'd go with 1. - this way you'd also avoid using lstr*** functions which are incredibly nasty.\nEDIT:\nIsn't this code basically reimplementing strtok + emplace each result in vector...?\nEDIT2: Come to think of it, if generic_string can be constructed from a pair of iterators then this function doesn't need to do any copying at all. . That's right, though this function is simple enough and it's probably easy to assure no new behaviour is introduced by rewriting it.. I have investigated the issue myself now and it seems pretty obvious that this MAX_PATH is arbitrary - so I'd say it's best to rewrite this function to range-construct strings for patternVect instead of tokenizing the array. This way you don't copy contents on the stack and thus remove a limit easily!\nIt also feels like this function should be returning a vector by value but that'd be a micro-optimization not worth the trouble.. Sure! I'll wait until the other PR is merged and re-submit, so it'll be of narrower scope.. @donho PR reissued as #4124. Looks like the \"real\" issue is that notepad++ identifies this file as UCS-2 Little Endian and using \"Encode in ANSI\" doesn't seem to take effect.\nIt appears like \"Encode in UTF-8/UCS-2\" options are actually mirrors of \"Convert\" options - only \"Encode in ANSI\" doesn't modify the file. To me it looks like a bug, but I'm not sure.. Potentially fixed with #3836. Since neither this page nor this MSDN page about LCIDs list those missing languages:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd318693(v=vs.85).aspx\nthose languages are probably not accounted for in Windows at all.. Seems related to #675. Since the repo contains a full source code, I'm sure authors are more than happy to see you contribute to a task like this.. Quick Googling shows:\n\nLiterate CoffeeScript\nBesides being used as an ordinary programming language, CoffeeScript may also be written in \u201cliterate\u201d mode. If you name your file with a .litcoffee extension, you can write it as a Markdown document \u2014 a document that also happens to be executable CoffeeScript code. \n\nAren't both extensions valid then? In which case you should append .coffee instead of replacing it.. > I can't make a PR for it atm because my current PR (#4173) is using master. And I could be wrong, but I suspect that committing it to a separate branch would still get it pushed onto PR#4173. \u2639\nIf you checkout the last commit before your PR, create a branch from here and work upon that, it should be all fine.. Hard to tell, but I would say it does. However, the bug report mentions -binary- files so it may not be it... This one sounds more like #4079. I'm pretty sure this is going to behave correctly if 64-bit Notepad++ is used.. It would also be handy to see the faulty file in question.\n. I have found more calls which compare file names - also included them for the sake of completeness (and potentially killing some edge cases if any of those hardcoded file names can be represented in more than one way).. I would very much discourage from relying on this undocumented behaviour. Yes, message 0x0049 is documented in Wine as WM_COPYGLOBALDATA, however since it's not exposed in public Windows headers I'd advise against using it.\nIt works for you - great. However, since it's undocumented, it may in theory stop working at any time. It works on Windows 10, but maybe it will stop working after the next Patch Tuesday? Or maybe it works on Windows 7 but not Windows 7 SP1? Maybe on Windows XP SP3 it causes a crash? With an application as serious as a text editor, it may be a very bad idea to take the risk.\nFYI both Command Prompt and PowerShell exhibit the same behaviour as Notepad++. Because of that, I'd classify this workaround as nothing more than a potentially unsafe hack.. @softmgr the contract doesn't seem to say anything about using undocumented Windows messages, so your observations may not apply worldwide.\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong, however.\nStill, even if it works \"fine\" on any possible OS set currently, it still doesn't seem like a good idea - this is nonstandard behaviour which is not present in Windows applications out of the box.. Option sounds more sensible, true. I definitely wouldn't want to see this always enabled.. UPDATE: First problem seems to be LVCOLUMN - it expects the string passed to be non-const, not sure why yet. Nonetheless, this is potentially the first candidate for fixing, as we can't really guarantee it never caused any issues.\nEDIT:\nCString looks like a fairly good way to solve this issue.. That looks fairly unfortunate... however, maybe it makes sense to redo this specific work again. All the other issues you linked concern general gcc compilation errors, whereas a change only concerning constness of string literals would naturally be of a narrower scope, and thus easier to maintain.\nI have const'ified some stuff already in the code and yet to encounter any issues - I guess I'll take a closer look in a few days from now.. See #4150 - I'll self-review this PR to mark which changes are not just trivial prepend of const to the var type.. Excuse me for not paying enough attention to the issue, but wouldn't using WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK message instead of counting times manually help mitigate the issue better?\nMight be tricky since it's in Scintilla though... eh.. Re-commited to fix indentation issues.. I tested a generic_string based implementation instead of ATL and it works fine - but will hold on changing it until #4154 is merged and rebase to avoid conflicts.. For once, you can't assume LVCOLUMN.pszText can point to a non-modifable string. It works fine now, but maybe in the future it'll start modifying the string, like using strtok to tokenize it? Current approach breaks the contract.\nThe other const qualifiers are purely cosmetic changes, however. IMO it's good to have that conform to the standard, and it's just safer overall - such refactor ensures you won't ever try to modify those strings by mistake (and you could attempt that now when they are assigned to non const-qualified pointers).. Looks good! I'll rebase my code on the latest master and see what is still left.. Rebased on top of latest master. As expected, 13801e35405841cfb8ff0af65023e341ba3dca34 renders some of my changes redundant, so now this PR only adds correct const qualifiers to variables and enables a related compilation option to ensure those don't happen again in the future.. Rebased on top of latest master.. Failed to reproduce on v7.5.4, so either it's fixed or those repro steps aren't sufficient. Please verify your issues against the newest version before submitting them.. Updated the PR with more instances of isXXX functions being used with TCHAR - replaced them with _istXXX functions.\nNOTE: There are more cases like this, but I haven't addressed them all yet. Namely, Scintilla still likes to use std::isspace.. UPDATE: std::isspace is templated, so no need to change anything. Thus, I think all offending cases have been addressed now!. Unable to reproduce on Win10 64-bit.. Translated with my limited Russian knowledge:\n\nPlease add a hotkey for \"Reload from disk\" command as \"Ctrl+F5\".. Likely related to #4078 - even if you're not on Windows 10, that covers the same topic (and would be fixable the same way).\n\nI'll look into it later nonetheless.. While this specific issue may indeed be out of date, I do think it would be beneficial to gradually phase out MAX_PATH from the codebase... Especially seeing comments like this:\nconst rsize_t longFileNameBufferSize = MAX_PATH; // TODO stop using fixed-size buffer\nIn fact, removing cases like this would be trivial - all cases like this\nTCHAR fullpath[MAX_PATH];\n::GetFullPathName(filename, MAX_PATH, fullpath, NULL);\nwould need to be replaced by one call to GetFullPathName to determine required buffer size, memory allocation and then another call to GetFullPathName to actually query data. Trivially wrap-able.\nRemoving all MAX_PATH from those specific calls would be a very good start, I'd say.\nIn this specific case, MAX_PATH constraint only exists because PathFileExists doesn't accept paths longer than that... However, it can be replaced by GetFileAttributes and this limit is gone, as per note on MSDN:\n\nIn the ANSI version of this function, the name is limited to MAX_PATH characters. To extend this limit to 32,767 wide characters, call the Unicode version of the function (GetFileAttributesW), and prepend \"\\?\\\" to the path. For more information, see File Names, Paths, and Namespaces.\nTip  Starting in Windows 10, version 1607, for the unicode version of this function (GetFileAttributesW), you can opt-in to remove the MAX_PATH character limitation without prepending \"\\?\\\". See the \"Maximum Path Limitation\" section of Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces for details.\n\nOne could argue that it's not beneficial to have only some parts of n++ support paths of arbitrary length. I agree when it comes to usability, but simple, iterative changes would make this more suitable for contributions from more than one person at at time. At the moment, long paths is an enormously huge task no one wants to undertake (myself included), however making progress towards it in small iterations may make it bearable to refactor and develop.\nEDIT:\nSo a quick test with variable length buffer, Windows 10 longPathAware manifest (prepending \\\\?\\ disables string canonization and I'm fearing it may have nasty side effects somewhere) and generic_string storing paths ends up being successful! Manifest tool thinks longPathAware option is unrecognized but seemingly it still works fine (GetFileAttributes fails without manifest and succeds with it).. There should be no space before question marks.\n. Can't reproduce.. I remember some WinAPI functions treat names like name. as extensionless - maybe you should try that? It's a long shot but perhaps it works.. GetVersionEx being deprecated isn't really an issue - changes of it dissapearing are close to none, and it's a perfectly legimate way of detecting systems as old as Windows XP (could only cause issues if you try to detect 8.1 or 10, but I believe notepad++ is already manifested for Windows 10 so even that is fine).. You may very well pack your JSON file and upload it anywhere externally.. You're on a very outdated version, does this still happen on 7.5.4?\n. Has been fixed in v7.5.5.. > after the latest notepad++ update\n\nNotepad++ v6.8.8\nBuild time : Dec 10 2015 - 01:11:37\n\n???\nOr is it that it used to work on 6.8.8 and breaks on 7.5.5?. I recall it being a disk image file, in which case it's binary and notepad++ struggling to open it properly is not really a valid issue.. Failed to reproduce on v7.5.5. What OS are you on? What version have you\ntested it with?\n. For what it's worth, one of the mice I own has those two buttons in very\nweird location and I end up clicking them by mistake more often than I'd\nwant. Maybe that issue concerns a similar problem.\n. Wouldn't hurt to try, I guess! After all, if it backfires it could be easily revoked back.. I got a proper fix for that (relying on UTC timestamps everywhere), will be submitting a PR soon.. It's a warning though, why is the build failing?\nVerifyVersionInfo is more correct in cases where n++ uses it iirc, but it is also deprecated, so it wouldn't get rid of this particular warning.. > and maybe also the scintilla component need to be checked.\nPerhaps - but what's the convention on making changes inside scintilla? It's not exactly clear right now.. Unable to reproduce -- n++ correctly sets this file to Unix script file and performs syntax highlighting.. Well, I have tested it and got syntax highlighting. It may not be complete, but it's there.. I honestly don't understand this... I realize you are trying to minimize memory usage, but this is miniscule...\nHOWEVER!\nsince n++ is Windows only anyway I could use malloca here - which would basically be a sweet spot between your request to have stuff on stack and my version which is safer as far as exploitation goes. malloca tries to allocate on stack (like alloca), and only allocates on the heap if it really has to (i.e. requested size is too big to be sensibly allocated on stack).\nWhat do you think? IMO it would be best since it prefers stack, but also does not allow things to go south (which would be the case if I opted for a static size buffer).. I'll flip your question - why bother if a static allocation is not 100% safe? A constant 256 size will indeed be good for most cases, but can you guarantee it will always be enough? And if not, why should this code fail just because of an arbitrary limit, which can be circumvented by allocating dynamically?\nEither way, I still propose malloca. In cases you want to cover (as in, up to 256 characters) it will always use the stack, so maybe even it will never ever use the heap - but if it ever has to, it will be handled correctly.. Duplicate of #1247, #2840\nRelated to #440, #1317, #2763, #3612. Why?\nEDIT:\nIf I just may point out, you are asking this in a repository for a Windows only software. I would be very surprised if @donho decided to \"flee\".. If you think that has no side effects, issue a pull request so it's easier to review/comment on!. @sasumner are symbols for v7.5.6 available anywhere? It would then be possible to see where it crashes exactly.. While I got a fix for that, it seems to break lines like this:\n<system.web test=\"-->\">\nHow does Visual Studio react to commenting/uncommenting such?\nFYI this part of Notepad_plus.cpp seems to be problematic:\nc++\n//-- Directly use Scintilla-Functions\n//   rather than _findReplaceDlg.processFindNext()which does not return the find-position and is not quiet!\nflags = SCFIND_WORDSTART;\n_pEditView->execute(SCI_SETSEARCHFLAGS, flags);. > Rather easy to make millions of users happier here.\nI think you are overestimating an amount of people who do all of the following:\n- use Windows XP\n- care about having their software as up to date as possible\n- cannot handle the fact software phases out XP support over 4 years after the system stopped being supported. We could probably replicate this behaviour\nIf the parameters build a path to an existing file, the parameters will be merged to one file path and the file will be opened.\neasily by combining all commandline parameters (after stripping -z) and checking if their sum is a path to a file.\nLet me run some tests on normal Notepad to verify if this is the case.. Do you think joining all arguments on space and checking if that result points to an existing file is sufficient?. That is true, but it's very unlikely that a series of legimate arguments will end up forming a valid absolute path to an existing file.. @donho What do you think about the proposal above?. Sure! Do you think it still makes sense to call it -z or maybe rename to something else indicating \"notepad compatibility\"?\n-quickPrint should be a separate PR I think, though.. Tough one... -nc historically stands for something else if I recall correctly, so might not be a good idea to use that.\nHonestly, no idea.. Since this would skip the arg and also change the way commandline is interpreted, not sure if it's a good idea.. No, -z ignores the argument directly following it, so:\nnotepad++.exe -z arg1 arg2 arg3 = notepad++.exe arg2 arg3\nor\nnotepad++..exe arg1 -z arg2 -z arg3 arg4 -z = notepad++ arg1 arg4, with the last -z doing nothing (because it's not followed by any argument).. Sure, I kinda forgot about this - do we have anything detailing how it is\nexpected to work, then? A commandline argument to switch n++ processor into \na \"notepad compatibility mode\"?\n. That looks good! I'll look into it soon, rebase and amend the second commit of this PR.. @Big--Mike @donho I have now added a new commit to this PR, adding -notepadStyleCmdline. It does the following:\n\nConverts /p to -quickPrint if it exists as the first parameter (this closes #3987 as far as I can tell)\nConcatenates all remaining parameters to form a file path, adding appending .txt extension if necessary\n\nI have not tested this under a desired use case, however it appears that remaining arguments (that is, those left after discarding arguments via -z) form a file for Notepad++ to open. This should satisfy the requirements.. How did you set it up? It'll only work if -notepadStyleCmdline is present.. They do different things, so yes. -z only skips the parameter.\nI felt like coupling both into one command line switch introduces too much implied behaviour, so they are separate.. -z needs to go last - after all, you're skipping next argument. In your case, you skipped -notepadStyleCmdline. Like I said:\n\nI felt like coupling both into one command line switch introduces too much implied behaviour, so they are separate.\n\nI don't know about you, but I could imagine the case where people want a Notepad style command line but they don't need to skip any parameters (eg. old batch scripts which they'd like to migrate by doing Find & Replace from notepad.exe to notepad++.exe -notepadStyleCmdline.. Fixed with #4622. The structure which was passed contained a non-POD type, std::string. Passing data is obviously a shallow copy, so with -Lpl this string held a \"pl\" string - thus, shallow copy of std::string passed pointers of instance A to instance B, but not their contents. Thus, trying to access the string crashed.\nI created this DTO object as a PDO type, which can be safely copied around. I could have also passed those strings safely, but they are not used after being passed to a new instance anyway.. Are you sure this is not some plugin or third party program stealing your key press? Maybe Sticky Keys?. Isn't this standard Windows behaviour?. For archival purposes, could somebody try and list all duplicates of this issue? @sasumner maybe?. Uhm...\nelse // more than 16 bits are not allowed here\nLooks like this code breaks on a 2002 assumption that utf-8 characters cannot be this long? Let's see if a quick fix for this is going to remedy all those outstanding issues.\nIf it does, then it'd be weird nobody fixed it over the years.. Thanks a lot! Those are actually three separate issues - two of which I fixed via #4922 and #4925, whereas third one (\u00a7 character breaking) remains unresolved. It's probably another uchardet bug, which was not fixed even after an update to 0.0.6.\nEDIT:\nAt some point I should try updating uchardet to a nightly version - perhaps the \u00a7 issue has been fixed since 0.0.6, which was released in 2016.. > Would be very good if you would grab responsibility for these annoying bugs.\nAfter both my PR's are merged, most of them should be gone! I, in fact, would go as far as closing all issues related to broken encoding (except the ones mentioning \u00a7 character, since we know that one will still be an issue), so it forces people to re-test and submit new issues.\nHowever, that is up to @donho to decide..

It is very common to see in this project that things get broken because of obviously poorly tested changes to the code base.\nFlow of accepting new PRs to the project is slow as-is, your suggestion would put the project in even bigger hiatus than it is right now.. I believe this is not a regression however, and it's just never been tested well enough.. I investigated it a bit and looks like it's actually not as stupid as it seems - this file contains last file opened history, and it's being flushed/recreated every time n++ is open.\nThat said, it'd be nice to resolve it but with this History thing in place, I'm not 100% sure how to do it (yet).. Just FYI, I reproduced this behaviour locally. Good find!. See #4920 for a fix.. If you can comment on your changes well enough, then feel free to issue a PR correcting those!. Sign checking could be a good idea, but it'd allow for some malformed characters, eg.\n110xxxxx 11yyyyyy\nMy variation will detect it's not a valid UTF-8 character and bail out, whereas a simple sign check would still pass this as a valid sequence of bytes.. Rebased on latest master to fix a merge conflict.. I disagree with this being a replacement. Ctrl+F4 may be a standard, but Ctrl+W is used just as widely. We shouldn't sacrifice one for the other.. If I recall correctly, CRT inits prior to C++ static initializers - but that may be an implementation detail.\nEven if that wasn't an issue, performing expensive operations like this in initializers could be considered \"rude\" - doing it the way you changed it makes more sense, IMHO.. To counter this, it's also something undefined  - unless C++ CRT initializes before user code, it may change from compiler to compiler. Maybe it works on Visual Studio 2015, but not Visual Studio 2017? Maybe works with Visual Studio up to version 15.7 but breaks with 15.8? Maybe it breaks with GCC 4.8 but not with GCC 4.7?. Would threading be an issue here? If so, std::call_once could be employed\nto ensure this initialization is called only once in a thread safe manner.\nOld code had no side effects like this so thread safety wasn't a concern -\nhere it is.\n. You are right, it should be safe to assume WM_CREATE won't be called from more than one thread at a time.. What language are you experiencing it with? It sounds like a localization issue.. See https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/4944 for a fix. I just upgraded from 7.5.8 to 7.5.9 and didn't reproduce it with description given above (aka \"any path with spaces in it outside Program Files won't work).. Not off top of my head. If you have Process Explorer, can you check how does notepad++.exe process spawn? What commandline arguments does it have when you launch it by doubleclicking a TXT file?. Have you checked with a non-minimalist package? Admitedly, I have no idea how is the minimalist one different from a regular one.. This is truly puzzling. I tried both \"Open\" and \"Edit with Notepad++\" and both end up quoting path properly.\nThankfully it seems like @donho noticed this issue - but I'm not 100% convinced if it's Notepad++ issue, in fact. After all, the behaviour of passing full file path to the application is controlled by Windows, not Notepad++.\n@garfieldbanks Are you able to compile n++ (no need to recompile Scintilla) on your own? If so, you could try and run bisect between 7.5.8 and 7.5.9. With a little bit of luck, it should be possible to find an offending commit.. That's what I was fearing. However, in defense of the change - commandline passed to Notepad++ on your end is not valid. I wonder why.. Are you using a custom shell? Or default explorer.exe? I just checked and usually doubleclicking should invoke\nprogram.exe \"%1\"\nso lack of quotes on your end imply something wrong with this action itself.. Have you done it manually? Then that'd be an user error, since it's not\ninvalid for applications to expect paths to be quoted. It's standard.\n. I guess it could. However, behaviour you want is now a part of -notepadStyleCmdline commandline switch.. I will submit a PR reverting uchardet for the time being. I am not sure if @donho commented on this and I don't have the power to decide nor to merge the commit, but looking at the amount of issues it causes I think it's the lesser evil.\nProper test cases should be created for the next time uchardet receives an update. Better yet, those should be taken upstream to uchardet itself.. I have now submitted #5414.. This is very upsetting. Upgrade broke detection in some cases but it was\ndone to fix it elsewhere - so what would mean the library introduced\nregressions. I'm not sure how to proceed with that, seems like a lose-lose\nsituation...\n. Perhaps it should be just rolled back then? Clearly there is something\nabout charset detection which makes it ridiculously hard to cover all cases\nflawlessly.\n. Aren't those already defined in Windows headers?. Fair point - older function would have crashed with null str2cut too but sticking an extra check won't hurt. Should I force push an update or have it as a separate commit? I'm not sure if force push works fine with pull requests.. Updated! Thanks.. It will work fine, have tested this case - if words are separated with multiple spaces, pBegin keeps being incremented together with pEnd and the inequality comparision will keep failing. Thus even if separated with more than one space, words are tokenized fine.\nI have also verified that output is valid if the string begins or ends with spaces.. What do you think about replacing\nif (*pEnd == ' ')\nwith\nif (*pEnd <= ' ')\n?\nThis way tokenizing would work on all whitespaces, not just space - which may be preferable for those who edit UDL manually.\nNot sure if this is completely safe when it comes to wchar_t signedness (which cannot be assumed in order to allow portability), but if this is a concern then an extra, semi-redundant > '\\0' check could be stuck in - potentially optimized out by the compiler anyway where applicable.. Good idea! I'll update the code accordingly to use it.. Pre-emptive note on removal of this call - notice setUnicodeMode is (and was even before my changes) called down below in both branches of if (encoding == -1) - thus this call is useless.. I realize SHGetFolderPath is also deprecated, however the other functions are even \"more\" deprecated.\nI can use SHGetKnownFolderPath for Vista and newer, however it creates a few minor problems:\n\nSHGetKnownFolderPath uses KNOWNFOLDERID instead of CSLID so the code isn't a drop-in replacement anymore. A function to convert those can be provided with ease, however.\nAre there any examples in n++ code on how to pick a different function for newer OS? This is generally an easy task, but I don't want my solution to be too different to what n++ employs currently. I am thinking of replacing this entire function with a member variable being a function pointer, default to XP-friendly variation of the function and replace it with a Vista+ overload if available. As for importing SHGetKnownFolderPath, I'm pretty sure I'll find an example of how functions obtained via GetProcAddress should be stored to conform with current code style.\nSHGetKnownFolderPath doesn't have A and W variations anymore - n++ is probably not going to support MBCS compilation anymore (no point really), but just for the sake of clarity it would probably be best not to include this code at all for non-UNICODE builds.. Very well then, I guess it makes sense to branch the code for XP/Vista+ then. While it may make the approach a bit less simple, I do think it makes sense to go for a slightly more complex solution and end up using the most up to date method available. Feels more future proof this way, and IMO with a project like this it should be a major decisive point.\n\nMy biggest issue with SHGetSpecialFolderLocation is that I believe it dates back to Win9x days - whereas SHGetFolderPath was deprecated \"only\" with the introduction on Vista.\nAbout MBCS, I'll make a decision basing on current state of the project - will try to compile it in multibyte and see if it's still possible. If it is, I'll include new code only for UNICODE builds, otherwise I'll include it without a macro.\nEDIT:\nSHGetKnownFolderPath doesn't seem to be limited to MAX_PATH, which for me is another argument towards using it where applicable, as I mentioned in #4078. Seeing how this proposal is completely different to the original idea, maybe it makes more sense to create a secondary pull request (not relying on this one) and leave both for review, so it can be decided which one should be chosen?. UPDATE: Literally everything breaks when trying to compile via MBCS, so no need to worry about this one \ud83d\ude06 \"Only\" 595 errors.. !ignoredFiles.empty(). !ignoredFiles.empty(). Does n++ account for grammar of non-English languages? In pretty much all Slavic languages this would require more than two strings (1 plik, 2-4 pliki, 5+ plik\u00f3w) but unless n++ actually accounts for that elsewhere, no point in worrying about this.. either auto& or message += std::move(file) - preferably the former. Props for going with a foreach though, they are much underused in the codebase (iterating through std::vector with an index and comparing it against size() makes me shiver a bit).. Glad to hear that - in which case keeping SHGetFolderPath makes sense because:\n\nCurrently PIDL is obtained only to form a path out of it (so SHGetFolderPath achieves the same result with less code).\nNo need to worry about freeing up memory.. I agree they both are equally performant, however you're talking about implementation details where I noticed the style. empty() just expresses your intent better.\n\nBesides, even though we both know size() and empty() are always going to stay the same, it's not guaranteed by the standard. Standard only guarantees that both methods must be of constant complexity for std::vector.\nFrom the assembly standpoint, both may be optimized out to just a single operation.. That's true ;) I think DirectDraw is one of the only exceptions to that \"rule\".\nMy personal favourite actually relates to those very shell functions which are of concern in this PR:\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031103-00/?p=41973. NON TRIVIAL CHANGE  - changed default parameter from NULL to \"\" so there is no need for this conditional check. Checking through all uses of this constructor, no one ever passes NULL to it so current behaviour stays unchanged.. NON TRIVIAL CHANGE - pszText requires non-const strings so I used CString for that. It's a perfect candidate (better than std::string), since its GetBuffer() returns a non-const string pointer. Not possible with std::string until C++17 or so.. NON TRIVIAL CHANGE - project settings..

C++11 requires double braces around those initial values.\nBecause of those two drawbacks, I think in this case using a C array is justified.. Good point! MSDN points out _totupper exists\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/library/45119yx3.aspx\nin which case it would fit this code best. Correcting.. In addition to previous changes, now _totupper is used, so it expands to towupper on _UNICODE compilations.. In addition to previous changes, now _totupper is used, so it expands to towupper on _UNICODE compilations.. Now uses std::array as suggested.. Notice a nasty truncation typecast is now gone.. Since you're checking for CreateFile return value, this check is redundant.. Are directories executable?. Sure, but you're not winning anything with this check. If the file/directory does not exist, CreateFile will fail anyway. Right now you are checking for file existence twice, and if GetFileAttributes returns valid data you still can't be sure that the file will still exist when CreateFile gets called (may very well be deleted between those two calls).\nThe logical approach would be to move GetFileAttributes inside the inner scope so it only gets executed if CreateFile succeeds.. _istdigit if you want to care about both. Since generic_string is typedef'd, I'd advice using a TCHAR version.. Yep. From Common.h:\ncpp\ntypedef std::basic_string<TCHAR> generic_string;\ntypedef std::basic_stringstream<TCHAR> generic_stringstream;. Yes, but getFileTime returns a string for file statistics, so it should be presented to the user in his local time, not UTC. Therefore, SystemTimeToTzSpecificLocalTime needs to be used, and since it operates on SYSTEMTIME, first this file time needs to be converted to system time.. That's outdated info.

I suppose it's OK to have that option in the settings for users who want to experiment.

If it's a file type that Notepad++ natively knows how to edit, then \"Find in files\" should include those files.  If not, then it shouldn't.

    "Predelnik": "Can you confirm that moving DSpellCheck.dll from plugins to disabled folder resolves the issue?\n. On one of machines I have access too it seems I am able to reproduce it but looks like it happens only in case I close Notepad++ approx. in 5 seconds or less after I started it.\nThe reason is poor design of my plugin which should actually be rewritten for the most part but it didn't cause many issues before so I was hesitating.\nHowever since rewriting is not a fast process anyway I've done some quick mending, it seems to resolve the issue at least in my case. It will be good if someone will check if it fixes problems in his/her case:\n(link somewhere below)\nBut if issue happens not only in close proximity of npp start then maybe I need to investigate further.\n. Ok apparently it was some derp by compiler, try this one:\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/s/acguqdqcxyyc846/DSpellCheck.dll\n. @donho sure I will make a new version right away then.\n. I've done it + updated link on plugins admin system\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/1.2.14.1\n. Ok apparently I accidentally broken quite a few things in plugin with my initial fix so I had to update it and it would be good if someone who was having the problems before will recheck it with version from here (from my side it's fine):\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/download/1.2.14.1/DSpellCheck.zip\nAs for the reason - it's because of some messages being sent from worker thread to GUI in plugin which technically may lead to hanging in case if application exits and waiting for threads to exit. Most of such things are luckily done based on user actions so it's not easy to reproduce. However some were (incorrectly) done on NPPN_READY notification, I just excluded those SendMessage calls for now. I haven't exactly figured why NPPN_READY behavior changed since the previous version of N++ though.\n. So I've made a quick-fix of my plugin which should solve aforementioned problem. It could be included in next Notepad++ version I guess.\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/download/1.2.14.2/DSpellCheck.zip\n. The problem was that I was incorrectly handly NPPM_GETCURRENTSCINTILLA message result which should be 0 when main scintilla editor/ view is active and 1 when adittional one. Sometimes it also equals -1, by the way it isn't mentioned on \"Messages And Notifications\" page but looks like I knew it from N++ source, I don't know in which cases exactly it happens but I accidentally treated it as the fact that N++ already closing and killed my worker thread which is part of context menu handling in current design.\n. So I've checked on windows 10 build 10166 with Notepad++ 6.7.9.1 on VM it seems like it isn't obviously reproducible at least, I'll continue looking into it.\n. @Rikk I'm now using Windows 10 on regular basis, haven't encountered any specific problems yet. Have no idea why it disappeared from installation.\n@dartraiden I've put version 1.2.14.2 onto N++ plugins admin website for a while already, looks like plugin manager admins haven't updated its database for a while.\n. Well since a lot of W10 preview users downloaded it from the website probably, it's possible that it was 6.7.9 version which appeared to be broken but wasn't put on auto-update. I just have not a slightest idea what could be affected due to changes in Windows 10 and from my experience it seems like everything works the same as before.\n. @mkitchin if you downloaded it from plugin manager it's probably 1.2.14.0 version, the problem most likely would be resolved with installing 1.2.14.2 https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/1.2.14.2\nMaybe I should write to plugin manager admin to hurry up the update process, because even I myself ran into this problem recently, once.\n. @dartraiden Thank you for that. I've sent him e-mail now just in case. Hope it'll be resolved.\n. Thanks to Dave for finally updating database and explanation, maybe new system will make things better.\nPersonally - while removal from installation discouraged me to make any big changes in plugin, I continue to use it as a user (half of the time on windows 10) and also get annoyed each time I have to install N++ update.\n. @dail8859 It's possible but technically plugin doesn't try to write settings on exit so maybe it's something else.\nAnyway I encourage anyone having that problem to download:\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/v1.3.3\nAnd if this message box still appears, create a dump using Task Manager (Ctrl+ Shift + Esc)\n\nAnd send it to me by any means comfortable to you.\nIf it does not happen with 1.3.3 please still comment here to signify that it fixed issue for you.\n. @mk2 Can you please try to save and send me a dump file as I have written in above comment?. @mk2 \nThank you very much for the dump file! It has proven to be of tremendous usefulness!\nIt would be really great if you check if replacing plugin with version from the link below fixes the issue:\nLink\nAnyone else having this issue can check too but it's x86 version, if you need x64 I will be glad to provide it.. @mk2 Thank you very much for checking it out! And sorry for this runaway underscore.. I release version 1.3.4 with fix for this issue:\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/v1.3.4\nSome technical details about the problem:\nApparently some notifications for plugins could come in certain cases after supposedly final notification NPPN_SHUTDOWN. I assumed that it never happens.\n. I had broken some things in 1.3.4 accidentally. So I had to release 1.3.5, it most likely should be fine in regards to this problem, but I just wanted to make sure.\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/v1.3.5\nSorry for the inconvenience!. I wasn't able to reproduce it.\nIf you can download 1.3.3 version of plugin and send me a crash dump (right click in task manager and \" Create Dump File\") that would be tremendous help.\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/download/v1.3.3/DSpellCheck_x86.zip. @byrnespd I ask you for the same favor then: can you download https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/download/v1.3.3/DSpellCheck_x64.zip and send me crash dump. That would be tremendous help.. I have possible suspicion that maybe it's due to missing %appdata%/notepad++/plugins/config directory. When there was plugin manager it was always created by it so there weren't any problem, but it also is created on Notepad++ install, so normally it should be there. I fixed in 1.3.3 but maybe underestimated importance of that problem.. @yafa4me Thank you for helping! That seems to be correct size. Can you put it on something like dropbox/google drive/one drive? Maybe directly though email (mine is predelnik@gmail.com). @yafa4me Thanks! I received a link, the data left me a bit confounded though, it seems like there is no indication of crash or presence of DSpellCheck.dll anywhere in call stack. Are you sure you captured it after Notepad++ crashed?\nBy the way just to make sure does clicking on spell-check icon/ pressing alt+a also crashes N++ for you or only calling print?. @yafa4me Sorry to bother you once more and I'm really grateful for your cooperation, DSpellCheck now is correctly in call stack. but sadly the bit about using 1.3.3 version for reproducing crash was important. Since that version is the first one I attached debug info too, I've tried to figure out what's going on from assembly for a bit but it's really not that easy. So if it won't bother you could you please also send dump obtained with version 1.3.3.. @yafa4me No worries! Thank you for your trouble! I will try to scrape info from your dump and maybe other people will provide crash dumps also. So hopefully it will already be fixed by then :). So for now what I came up with is that repeating the crash caused by renaming plugins/config directory on my side gives exactly the same callstack as provided by @yafa4me. Note equality in last 4 digits because DLL base address is multiple of 0x10000. It's hard to be a coincidence.\nMissing plugins/config:\n\nDSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe003a9cf3()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe003a9c8a()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe003a9ca5()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe003affda()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe0033b6ae()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe00339ebf()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe00316bce()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n\nCrash Report:\n\nDSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe51579cf3()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe51579c8a()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe51579ca5()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe5157ffda()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe5150b6ae()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe51509ebf()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n    DSpellCheck.dll!00007ffe514e6bce()  Unknown No symbols loaded.\n\nHowever that's a bit contradictive because 1.3.3 clearly fixes the issue on my side. Anyway for anyone experiencing this issue, please check that you have %appdata%/notepad++/plugins/config in place. And in any case download 1.3.3 version, if you're still experiencing crash with it please provide a crash dump if possible.\n. @yafa4me Thank you very much for testing and reporting results back!\n@donho It looks like DSpellCheck 1.3.3 is better be provided with next version of Notepad++. This issue should be relatively rare since the required directories should generally be created on install but I can't be sure. Sorry for inconvenience.. @dail8859 Yes with Notepad++ 7.5.4 which includes DSpellCheck 1.3.5 it's fixed.. Can you please check if updating Spell-checking plugin fixes the issue?\nhttps://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/v1.3.5. @donho This is just a slight regression from 1.3.2 where it would not work for some people because I disabled passive mode for FTP. I could make 1.3.6 for that but I don't think it's that serious.\nAs for 1.4.x it would be nice to include this one eventually but I think that it's better to wait at least for 1.4.2 where I will fix a couple of issues. I don't think it can't wait until next N++ release.\n. It happens because file is basically a single line and thus it gets spell checked entirely while having size of 1.5 mb.\nI will look into limiting that.\nDisabling spell-checking (alt+a) works as good as disabling the whole plugin.. With release https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/v1.4.4 (which is also available through plugin manager now) spell checking such files should work much more smoothly. It would be nice if you'd also check it on your side.. So first of all - I haven't seen this issue before and I'm sorry for it but it's really not easy to find all the relevant issues unless they are linked to me directly or separate DSpellCheck issues are created.\nI'm not exactly aware how can DSpellCheck affect Notepad++ behavior to that extent. I've created the following test: 15 files each 400'000 - 20 symbol lines. And I confirm it really takes Notepad++ 7.5.9 around 10-12 cpu seconds to load and around 5-6 cpu seconds to switch to other tab, 3 cpu seconds to previously opened up tab. Personally I don't see much of a difference with or without DSpellCheck even with spell-checking turned on in these parameters even if there's 1 cpu second difference in initial load time, it's definitely not anything like 2x slowdown. So in this case it does not seem to be noticeable.\nAlso I checked that current github master version of N++ works much faster in cpu time and probably even faster in perceived time (I do not know what exactly was changed there), however still not see much of a difference with or without DSpellCheck present.\nSo I welcome the examples where difference with/without DSpellCheck is more clearly visible than in mine (Just write the specs I can do generation myself)\nAlso note that I'm testing on latest version of DSpellCheck where some things may have been imrpoved but if the spell-checking is turned off it should not really make much of a difference. https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/v1.4.10\nI have a theory where some of the time might be wasted but I have to profile Scintilla for that since how efficient certain Scintilla operations are is not always clear. I will try to do that shortly.\nEdit: One clumsy thing I've noticed is that I always load the dictionary even if spell-checker disabled accidentaly, generally it should be done in less than 50ms and in latest version I do that asynchronously so that's effectively turns it to 0 in terms of gui responsiveness and this does not scale with amount or size of files opened so it could not be the reason I think. But still I'll fix that in the future.\nScintilla profiling mostly shows text layout operations on my files, nothing caused by plugin. So I would really like to see some better examples demonstrating the problem.. > all known incidents, back at the notepad++ community, that either had this lag problem or the \"Exception reason: vector too long\" issue, were solved with satisfaction, once the o.p. uninstalled DSpellCheck.\n\n(at least all cases, where we got feedback from the o.p., but i guess that even the 1-2 that did not report back, would have persisted, if their personal issue would not have been solved)\n\nWell that's just another problem - \"Exception reason: vector too long\" issue (which by the was way accidentally introduced while fixing performance problem) was fixed relatively fast in version 1.4.7. However Notepad++ still bundles version 1.4.6 (note: current version is 1.4.10) so I still get error reports for that.\n\nnote: most of them were not even aware that they had DSpellCheck installed, as it is a forced, bundled plugin, so making DSpellCheck optional might be the most logical choice.\n\nWell, considering previous point, if it will be better updated in this case, then maybe I agree. But for issues such as this I would still like to find out what is the problem how to reproduce it in my environment.\n\nmy best guess for the lack of reports at the DSpellCheck project site would be, that many users do not open an issue at the DSpellCheck project site, if they do not require a spell checker in notepad++.\n\nIt does not have to be that at all, if removing DSpellCheck solves a problem anyone who maintains Notepad++ can send me a link and there were already cases like that in the past.\n\nall who do need DSpellCheck would probably have submitted an issue to your tracker already. (you would have to re-check that)\n\nFor issues of such nature it's unobvious, it's not always easy to guess that causes performance problems, no matter if you use or do not use plugin functionality.\n\nyes, and thank god that it does not happen to all users, otherwise we would not get any sleep at all, assisting such hypothetically vast amount of reports ;-)\n\nSo you are implying that it somehow depends on user's system configuration or hardware. Personally I fail to see how, if poor performance happens on weaker machine then larger files should make same issue appear on more performat machines or at least make plugin contribution noticeable. It may lie in the nature of the files used however that's why I'm asking for good examples.\n\nif you like, you can read more about every day incidents regarding DSpellCheck, or any other topics that might be of interest to you, over at the notepad++ community.\nwe would also appreciate, if you would take the time to answer some of them first-handedly.\n\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/17212/an-exception-occured-due-to-plugin-dspellcheck-dll\nWell so as I see you recommend updating DSpellCheck as a \"workaround\" but updating it in Notepad++ somehow is still not done.

Even replacing all those \"@\"s by \"~\"s sometimes crashes Notepad++.\nIt can also crash when undoing such replace by using Ctrl-Z (if it didn't crash by then yet, try a series of Ctrl-Y(==redo), Ctrl-Z(==undo) after this, crash will be nearby)\n. Update: found people mentioning PlugIn \"Location Navigate\" when Notepad++ crashed. So I decided to uninstall this PlugIn.

Hi,\nI've just tested the bug with new version that fix the CIA hacking of NPP V7.3.3. \nAnd it's still crashing, here's a dump. But you're able to create one if you do what I have written one year ago.\nNote: Could be good to create the DUMP out of Program files directories or do we need to run NPP as admin in order to catch dump? If so, maybe you can add a note to \"Failed to create dump file\" message.\nNppDump.zip\nRegards. Currently, this has no effect on the problem I have described 2 years ago.\nThere is no plugin at all in my version, only basic installation.\nDownload and install the latest Npp version 7.5.8.\nDownload the zip file upper (24 Mar 2016).\nUnzip the text file.\nOpen the big text file with Npp.\nSelect Edit / Blank Operations / Trim Trailing Space\n=> kaboom\nSame on W7, 32 or 64, or W10.\nRegards.. Thanks Claudia ( or Frank :) )\nI never noticed that this backup switch has this effect, that's going to help me to test deeper.\nOriginal file is from Linux, the \\r is used in the original tool as a text breakline, you may have multiple breaklines in one line (a bit weird I know), then the report is sending the \\r then blank until the final \\n.\nThe description of the error supra, is a simple case that always generate a dump. Originaly I had random crashs by replacing ' AAA AA' (and other strings) by space or nothing. Sometimes no crash but result contains non ASCII characters and missing lines. I have the feeling that the bug is the same in both cases as it looks like storage violation on big file (I could have more that 100000 replacements per command). \nAnyway, I will try to generate a new file today and to remove these \\r firstly.\nRegards. Hi, just to confirm case #240 with last hypothesis of @ClaudiaFrank \nwhen instant backup period is greater than duration for replacement, the crash doesn't occur anymore.\nThanks. Oui tout \u00e0 fait. Je pense que tout le monde peut le faire.\nSi ta question est \"Est-ce que tu peux tester la version corrig\u00e9e?\", j'ai de nouveaux fichiers (125 Mo), donc oui c'est possible.

Pardon, tout est d\u00e9crit dans le thread #240 (https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/240#issuecomment-200867146) , il y a un fichier pour le test, il suffit de l'\u00e9diter et faire supprimer les blancs de fin de ligne (ou toute op\u00e9ration un peu longue de remplacement, qui va mettre le bazar dans les pointeurs).\nAvec la sauvegarde instantan\u00e9 \u00e0 7 secondes par d\u00e9faut, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, \u00e7a va au tas.. I think @pnedev is on the right way. I had some issues with long replacement operations (replace all xxx xxx xxx by nothing on big file) after version 6.5.5 (Version 6.6 major change was \"The main feature of this release is Session snapshot & periodic backup.\"), without any plugin, and I have found that issue with trailing blank that does the same error and easily reproductible with dummy data. On my point of view, the reason was the same, it seems you have solved replacement crash ( it was 2 years ago), as I don't have anymore garbage in my file with current version (replacement generated crashs or memory dump in middle of text file).\nAs @ClaudiaFrank has seen, disabling the periodic backup is solving the issue on trailing blank, then it is certainly because it is trying to copy a memory block that has changed. .

The plugin uses a std::list called ActionDataList to record file editing events in the beNotified function. In a seperate thread (created by the plugin), the ThreadFunc function reads the ActionDataList to populate the \"Location History\" list in the plug-in's option window, removing each list item as it goes. When a large number of edits are performed in a short amount of time, these threads access the ActionDataList simultaneously, i.e. in an indeterminate state. Hence ThreadFunc causes a memory violation.\nAdding std::mutex locks and unlocks around all accesses to ActionDataList appears to resolve the issue.\nIs the plugin developer still maintaining this project, and are they aware of this problem? I may have to create a SourceForge login in order to contact them.... ",

    "ClaudiaFrank": "@Barbapoux - thx for sharing the document.\nWhile investigating a similar issue I can confirm that using your document \nand doing the described steps it consistently crashes npp when backup is activated, \nwhile it seems to work without a problem if backup is disabled.\nI' currently running some automated tests to see if this is really the case.\nOne additional info - your file is a bit unusual for a text editor, \nas it contains different eols and binary data.\nThe impact of this content needs to be investigated as well.\nWill keep this thread updated..

Hopefully usefull.\nLangMenuPatch.txt\n. Boost 1.59 has different paths, so please use 1.55 as suggested.\nOne hint so, run it from your visual studio command prompt instead of a normal one.\n. I'm using the boost 1.66 prebuild  NuGet Packages together with VS2017 \nbut with Visual Studio 2015 - Windows XP (v140_xp) platform toolset mode.\nSeems to work. Just in case you wanna give it another try with VS2017, the steps I've done are\n1) Download/Clone npp repository to your harddisk\n2) Start VS 2017\n3) Open Project/Solution and open the file \n    DOWNLOADED_REPO\\notepad-plus-plus\\PowerEditor\\visual.net\\notepadPlus.vcxproj\n   Confirm the question about GIT soure control\n-> now you should see that Notepad++ (Visual Studio 2015 - Windows XP) has been added to Solution Explorer\n4) add scintilla project by right clicking Solution->Add->Existing project\n   and open file DOWNLOADED_REPO\\notepad-plus-plus\\scintilla\\win32\\SciLexer.vcxproj\n5) Save current solution\n6) update boost nuget packages\n   Tools->Nuget Package Manager->Manage Nuget Packages for solution\n   and confirm to update the two boost packages\nwait some time until you see the ========== Finished ========== message\n7) open file DOWNLOADED_REPO\\notepad-plus-plus\\scintilla\\win32\\SciLexer.vcxproj in Notepad++ \n   and delete the 4 lines referring to boost 1.58 -> save it\n8) confirm to reload solution in VS2017\n9) right click on SciLexer project -> Build ==>> done\n. Good to see - do you, by any chance, use VS2017 professional or higher?\nBecause for my VS 2017 Community Edition it seems it doesn't delete those old 1.58 entries.. Can't say for sure, but might be - but didn't we speak about toolset 14.0 (VS2015)?\nIf you do need to use 12.0 then yes, you need to install VS2013 (afaik there is no standalone product)\nbut if you don't care about it then you can compile it even with toolset 14.1\nJust did it a few minutes ago.\nVS2017, Notepad++ and SciLexer with Platform Toolset v141, boost 1.67 and boost_regex-vc141 1.67\n. No, not anymore - only Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.\nHopefully the Screenshot shows everything needed to know\nMay I ask you what kind of error message you get when you try to compile SciLexer?\nYou did change the toolset on each project and on the solution, didn't you?\n\n. I did as I was knowing that I want to use toolset 141 but you are right, I could image that \nVS tries to update the existing version even if you configure to use a newer toolset.\nSo what I did with this install after downloading the sources and building a solution file \nwas to remove the existing boost versions and to replace them with the version \ncompatible to the used toolset, which in my case was the version 1.67 build with toolset 141.. My pleasure and maybe now you need to remove the old entries I mentioned in step 7.. @bfridkis, yes build works as well, as I haven't changed code, at the time I did the screenshot, and it was already build I used rebuild instead of cleaning first and then build it again.\nIf you cannot retarget, wouldn't this mean that you haven't installed the proper compiler?\nNot 100% sure if this is even possible? I mean, to install VS2017 but not to install the 141 toolset?\nI will give it a try,  ~8-9hours, once I'm back home again..

So I assume there must be a explicit way how this\nhappens.\nMy steps\n1) Create a test.txt in C:\\users\\admin\\documents with MS Editor.\n2) put some content in and save it\n3) start npp and open test.txt\n4) modify file in MS Editor and save it\n5) click on npp -> received popup saying file has been updated... -> click yes\n6) content updated in npp\n7) changed content in npp and save it\n-> no crash\nMy config\nNotepad++ v6.8.9\nBuild time : Jan 12 2016 - 00:00:51\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : ON\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10\nPlugins : ComparePlugin.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExec.dll NppExport.dll NppFTP.dll PluginManager.dll PythonScript.dll SpellChecker.dll \n. This surprises me, normally utf-8 is the default encoding npp uses.\nI tried to replicate your issue by creating a utf-8 file on my linux machine. Checked by using file -bi.\na) if loaded by npp eol doesn't get replaced automatically\nb) if I changed to windows eol everything was still ok.\nSo I assume, either one, of possibly installed, plugin or the big number of lines is causing this.\nIs there a way for you to make some test to see when this happens e.g. a file loaded with 10 lines\n100, 1000 and so on?\n. if I put a \uc2b4 I see a \uc2b4 \ntested on 6.8.9\n. You can put it in yourself by modifying shortcuts.xml.\nA full description about the configurstion files can be found here.\n. open UDL dialog, select language and press remove button or\nedit userDefineLang.xml directly.\n. I still have it, Did you check Settings->Preferences->LanguageMenu, maybe it's\nin the disable list.\n. @devs\nAssumtion is that npp and and explorers aren't on same elevation level.\nAnswer has been given in npp forum.\n. Just in case you aren't aware, in the meantime you can add it yourself by using\nSettings->Style Configurator->Verilog->Instruction Word and add it to user defined keywords.\n. Why not setting your default?\nSettings->Preferences->Default Directory\n. Yep, agreed - I was searching if it has been already reported but didn't find it.\nI'm going to close it.\n. Is this still the case?\nPlugin Manager needs to download the file, so it could happen when there is a network issue\nor sourceforge (as hoster) has a problem that you encounter such issue.\n. As said, it might be that sourceforge as a hoster had problem ( this isn't unusual, it happens from time to time). To be honest, I don't think that there is a general issue, I would expect much more reports\nif this would be the case. Do you think it's ok if you close the issue?\n. By enabling Settings->Preferences->Backup->Enable session snapshot and periodic backup\ndirectory can be changed.\n. This setting enabling Settings->Preferences->Backup->Enable session snapshot and periodic backup\nis for periodic backup.\n. I assume you refer to the refresh entry in context menu of NppFTP if this is the case\nplease address this issue to author of NppFTP.\n. You could do it by using Settings->StyleConfigurator->Language->VB/VBS\nand add the extensions to User ext.:\n. @vgturtle127, I can't tell you for .bas, I should have googled it but it isn't true for\n.frm (used by mysql) and .cls (used by latex)\n. VB folding is based on indention you could even write\nthese lines\n    gets\nfolded as well\nAnd folding is done by scintilla component so if you want this to be changed you need to address\nthis at scintilla group\n. Temporary workaround should\nwork here as well\n. Temporary workaround\n. Sounds like author of NppAutoIndent needs to take care of this\n. Tried it on windows7 x64 npp 6.9 without a problem. Did you try to load the file it with no plugins installed?\n. Sounds like you are running npp elevated (as administrator). Try the same using standard user.\nCheck debug info (? menu) if admin mode on is set.\n. Is there any additional information you could provided to get this reproduced?\nLike it happens always with xml documents or when doing this and that.\nWhich npp version do you use? Can you provide the debug info? Can be found under ? menu.\n. I guess I understand what you posted but I don't see what's your question/wish.\nDoesn't npp offer the \"correct\" testVariable or do you always want to have the suggested words sorted\nin the way that non-accent words get listed first?\n. Does this also happen when starting npp with -noPlugins switch?\n. Please start notepad++ with the -noPlugin switch (plugins don't get uninstalled, they just been ignored)\nand see if the problem still exists.\nWhat about updating to the current version?\n. Assuming your program/script whatever else can be executed directly via cmd shell then put the following into F5 inputbox\ncmd /k cd $(CURRENT_DIRECTORY) && $(FULL_CURRENT_PATH) \n. functionlist.xml is configurable and here is described what needs to be done.\n. No, PluginManagerGpup.xml is used for temporary actions, this doesn't indicate being a problem.\nThe error itself doesn't point to a npp issue - it is just an informal message for you.\nE.g. sometimes sourceforge does have an issue when trying to connect to the plugin repository\nand you will get the installation error. So, it could be, that even another attempt would have installed\nthe nppexec but, of course, it could be also that the PluginManagerPlugins.xml was corrupt.\n. I assume you have a better chance to get this answered by the npp community forum.\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community\nIf you agree, may I ask you to close this issue?\n. Cannot confirm reported behaviour on Windows 7 x64 using latest 7z package.\n\n. > Sorry, but I don't have this menu. What I can do to have it?\nUpdate npp to latest version.\n. Could you check debug info (available under ? menu)\nIs Local Conf mode : ON or OFF?\nIf OFF, would you mind close npp and open explorer open %APPDATA%\nand rename notepad++ directory. Restart npp and check again.\nIf this solves your problem would you mind zipping the .xml files under\n%APPDATA%\\notepad++ directory and attach it to this thread?\n. @cmcesario, sorry for answering so late.\nMay I ask you to make a further test?\nCan you rename the new created notepad directory and put the old \none into place again? Does so problem reoccur?\n. That explains why I didn't have any issues using your config files.\nSo question is, why solves recreation of appdata directory different unexpected behaviors?\nAt least this gives the information which part of code needs to be investigated deeper.\n. Problem is the exclamation mark.\nDuplicate #1595 \n. Thank you @AlyxMoon,\nvery much appreciated.\n. @donho for example the one mentioned in issue #1595\nhttp://lederniergaulois.nouvelles-ecritures.francetv.fr/#!/episode1\n. already fixed. @rugk - yes, scintilla has ports for GTK+ and QT but the rest/most part of the code depends on windows\nAPI heavily.. As Guy pointed out, the \\z switch could (should) be used to match the end of a buffer.\nSo new regex could be (?-s)[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+.-]+://.?(?=\\s|\\z). Hi @dail8859,\n1) yes, a scheme like http, https, file, etc... is specified that it must be start with a letter\nbut may contain numbers, dashes and dots. So something like z39.50s:// is absolutely valid.\n2) I guess I don't get the point here. In your example it would match \"https://[blank]\" whereas with .*?\nit wouldn't. But I see that it needs to be improved because otherwise a url containing a scheme followed by\n:// only, would be formatted. Will follow up.\n. I guess this\n(?-s)[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+.-]+://[^\\s]+?(?=\\s|\\z)\nwould do the trick - will run the tests to see if it is the case.. tests passed, so actual proposal is to use\n(?-s)[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+.-]+://[^\\s]+?(?=\\s|\\z). requirements could not be fullfilled. OK - I thought those messages get triggered by npp and consumed by plugins but if\nit is allowed that plugins can trigger it than it must obviously stay.. I see - thanx for clarification.\nVery much appreciated.. @guusjans \ncurious, how is your setting for settings->preferences->multi-instance?. Old thread, imho can/should be closed as issue reported does not occure anymore.. Could it be that you are using ATI graphic cards and its manager - as far as I remember this application\nhas a global shortcut set.. Didn't see your reply about the fact that it works when your mentioned buttons do have the focus.\nWe must have posted nearly simultaneously.\nCould you give it  a try to see if it works by using https://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/7.x/7.5.8/npp.7.5.8.bin.minimalist.7z \nor https://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/7.x/7.5.8/npp.7.5.8.bin.minimalist.x64.7z if switched to x64?\n. Can confirm reported behavior - will try to find out what is causing it.. The issue is that the replace button from the replace dialog and the replace control from the find_in_files_dialog do share the same accelerator but it looks like no code within the find_replace_dialog handles this conflict. There is a function enableFindInFilesControls which could be used I guess.\nBy introducing something like\n```\n    if (isEnable)\n    {\n        ::ShowWindow(::GetDlgItem(_hSelf, IDREPLACE), SW_HIDE);\n        ::SetWindowText(::GetDlgItem(_hSelf, IDREPLACE), _T(\"Replace\"));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ::ShowWindow(::GetDlgItem(_hSelf, IDREPLACE), SW_SHOW);\n        ::SetWindowText(::GetDlgItem(_hSelf, IDREPLACE), _T(\"&Replace\"));\n    }\n```\nthe accelerator can be used with both buttons. \nFrom my understanding this would temporarily remove the accelerator from the Replace button\nif the find in files dialog opens and put it back if the controls do get disabled again.\nBut I'm sure there is some other better/cleverer way to solve this.\n. Update:\nthis is the last working one\nLanguage menu and Style configurator sorted alphabetically and use the same language name in the Style configurator as the language menu.\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/donho/notepad-plus-plus/build/1.0.1526\nthis is the first which breaks it\nSwitch to VS 2015\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/donho/notepad-plus-plus/build/1.0.1530\nThere were no builds from 1.0.1527 to 1.0.1529 due to errors.. not relevant. @donho - What I did was using python script plugin and checking under the following conditions\nvalidity check tests\nstart of file tests\n    url at start of file (no additional text) (acts also as end of file test)\n    url at start of file (followed by tab)\n    url at start of file (followed by space)\n    url at start of file (followed by eol)\n    url at start of file (followed by tab and text)\n    url at start of file (followed by space and text)\n    url at start of file (followed by eol and text)\n\nend of file tests\n    url at end of file (preceded by tab)\n    url at end of file (preceded by space)\n    url at end of file (preceded by eol)\n    url at end of file (preceded by text and tab)\n    url at end of file (preceded by text and space)\n    url at end of file (preceded by text and eol)\n\nin the middle of a file tests\n    url in the middle of a file (preceded and followed by tab)\n    url in the middle of a file (preceded and followed by space)\n    url in the middle of a file (preceded and followed by eol)\n    url in the middle of a file (preceded and followed by text and tab)\n    url in the middle of a file (preceded and followed by text and space)\n    url in the middle of a file (preceded and followed by text and eol)\n\ninvalidity check tests\nsame tests as before but url contains \"invalid\" unicode points like nbsp etc...\n\nThe tests created urls by looping through unicode points which were added to\na fix scheme (http) and authority part (://wikipedia.org/) and checking the returned length\nfrom the proposed regex.\nDo you think this is sufficient? Any additional ideas?\nI assume you like to have c++ unit tests, correct?\nIf so, do you already have some ideas how those should be build/created?\nI don't have any experience in c++ unit test but willing to learn and creating/providing them.\n. @donho \nsorry, thought about it for some time now but to be honest, without having access to the boost regex engine I don't see how this could be accomplished.\nOf course, the regex, could be tested by powershell but the idea of unit testing would be broken\nas boost regex code changes or any other possible future npp regex engine, other than the .net regex engine,\nare covered by those tests anymore. Maybe I'm missing something but as said, I don't see how this\ncould be used to your benefits.\n. requirements cannot be fullfilled. not relevant. I use twodark theme and the edge line for quite some time now but never encountered such issue.\nCould you provide more details? Does this happens always? If so, can you provide the exact steps\nto replicate the reported behavior? Which npp version do you use (debug-info)?\n. Ok, I guess I understand.\nIt it not the theme itself which causes this but the font being used.\nNon-mono-spaced fonts do have different width therefore the edge line seems to jump.\nI would suggest, to use mono-spaced fonts then this shouldn't be an issue anymore and\nto make it happen you either have to tick the enable global font check box or you have to\nset it for every style id independently.. If you refer to Col:81 of the statusbar this means the cursor is in front of that column.\nIf, for example, you would put the cursor to the start of the line, it would report Col:1\nWhat is done is this, scintilla, the underlying control which does all of that, calculates\nthe position of the edge line by taking the width of the space character of the default style - done.\nIf the font has different width of different characters then this doesn't really work at all.\nSame is true for \"mono-spaced fonts\". One could imagine that a mono-spaced font uses\nalways the same width for each character but, unfortunately, this isn't true always. The Roboto Mono\nfont, I recently started to use, seems to have a different width of the space character compared to\nall other characters. I hope this clarifies the situation a bit.\nEdit: Have to correct - space char in Roboto Mono font has same width as other chars as long\nas the same type is used, was comparing regular font with italic font which are different in width size.. Don't have reported behavior, anything you see that is different to your setup other than OS?\nI don't expect the local conf mode or using a zip being the culprit - but maybe worth testing it.\n\n. As sasumner pointed already out, this is handled by scintilla but, for your macro behavior,\nyou might consider reassigning the END key to SCI_LINEEND instead of SCI_LINEENDWRAP\nSee ShortcutMapper->Scintilla Commands . I assume you are using some unicode, probably utf8 (?), encoding, if so, temporary workaround check Match case box.. seems to be fixed already. seems to be fixed already. seems to be fixed already. @bfridkis was so kind to describe in detail what needs to be done here. use Suchmodus Normal instead of the Erweitert.. Actually you replaced the existing backslashes by backslashes.\nBy defining the extended (Erweitert) search mode the replace part (Ersetzen durch) treats the first backslash as a escaping char for the next char. (for testing replace the \\\\ with something like A and you will see). Works for me on 7.5.6.\nAre you sure you don't have another lexer like rebol, scheme, asm etc... active, which uses the semicolon as comment char? If so, check your langs.xml file for this line\n<Language name=\"r\" ext=\"r s splus\" commentLine=\"#\">\nMight be that the rebol lexer is active as it is using the same extension as R.\n. Just in case you need a wrokaround, PythonScript solved that this way.\n. Goto Settings->Preferences->Default Directory\nand check Use new style dialog .... >Why not have a radio button option instead \"Use Old Style Windows Explorer Integration\" or \"Use New Style No Windows Explorer Integration\" and set the previous functionality to default?\nI would prefer such approach too.\n\nIn any case, is there a registry setting we can apply through our domain group policy to stop our end users from hounding the helpdesk guy?\n\nExcept for those features which do need to be stored in registry, like extension assignment, npp stores\nit configuration in xml files. The one you are looking for is config.xml and the section in question is\n<GUIConfig name=\"MISC\" fileSwitcherWithoutExtColumn=\"yes\" backSlashIsEscapeCharacterForSql=\"yes\" newStyleSaveDlg=\"no\" isFolderDroppedOpenFiles=\"yes\" docPeekOnTab=\"no\" docPeekOnMap=\"no\" />\nOf course newStyleSaveDlg=\"no\" needs to be adapted to your needs. . This is because the sql lexer defines a property sql.backslash.escapes which is set to 1 per default.\nIn order to get your wanted behavior it needs to be set to 0.\n\n. Looks like this is already addressed by scintilla with the newest sql lexer\n\n. Hello Vittaly,\n\nWhat it is mean? Problem already fixed in npp or will be fixed soon?\n\nNeither nor, first it is an info for you that you can make it work if you set the property with\na scripting language plugin like python script/lua script etc ..., akthough I'm not sure if this is sufficient \nfor you and an info to the all other fellows that an updated lexer has already addressed this issue.\nIf or when this is going to be fixed is beyond my power.. Depends, how did you solve it for yourself? Did you install/use python script plugin, lua plugin, NppExec ... ?. Can't see this on my side.\n\n. So I assume qKeyboard does also have HighDPI issue, unfortunate I don't have such a nice monitor to\nconfirm that it is related to HighDPI.. As this doesn't happen to me and maybe doesn't happen to others as well may I ask you if you can \nshare the document you are using to replicate this? Or does this happen with any document, even empty ones?. We can't say for sure but without having a reproducible way it is hard to say if npp or the plugin or something else was the culprit - did you, by any chance, update the spell checking plugin recently?\nThen it might explain why it can not be reproduced anymore.. Does not happen to me - could you give the following a try\n1. Stop npp\n2. Temporarily rename the notepad++ directory under %APPDATA% (which normally expands to \nC:\\Users\\YOUR_USER_NAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Notepad++\n3. Start npp\nDo you still see the reported behavior?\nIf not, might you consider sharing the content of the temporarily renamed npp directory\nby zipping it and upload to some hoster where one can download it?. Thx for testing - three monitor setup makes me asking whether you use Nvidia graphic cards and their\nNView Manager (that was the name they used to call it some time ago - maybe nowadays it has a different name). The application which allows you to bind applications to a certain monitor etc...\nIf so, can you disable it for npp?. Actually I'm not sure if this is a npp bug at all as it has been reported that updating the NView Manager \nor the display driver might solve the issue.\nAnd without using such cards, mainboard onboard graphics is sufficient for me, it is hard to debug at all.. If you would have provided the information you were asked for when creating this issue,\nthen probably someone could have given some adivce. But without knowing your setup .... Note sure if you can blame npp for doing possible catastrophic backtracking regexes.\nIt would be nice if npp would throw an error instead of selecting everything but the regex itself\nshould be changed imho, although not an regex expert at all.\nI guess this one does what you want.\n(?is)<record>(?>(?!</record>).)*?text-string-to-find.*?</record>. Looks like I haven't made myself clear - I absolutely agree that in case of an error, like a stack overflow, \nnpp should return an error instead of matching the whole text - that is definitely a misbehavior of npp.\nIt was about \"your expected behavior\" that the regex should match, even in such cases,\nwhich led me to propose another regex solution, but now I see that your concern is the same as mine.\nNpp needs to take care that errors like stack overflows can happen and should not result in returning \nthe whole document as the only match.\nSorry for confusion.. What I found out so far - an exception is thrown but searchInTarget function returns 0, which is, of ourse,\na valid position aka the first position in a document. \nOne possible solution might be to call SCI_GETSTATUS because this is set to 1 in this case.. Can you provide information how large such a file should be to encounter this issue?. Was able to convert even a bigger file without that issue BUT only on a x64 version\n\non 32bit I encountered a freeze - I'll try to dig deeper.\n. Works for me, see here.\nWould you mind trying the steps I've asked for here?. Actually I think it should do exactly what it does, to get what you want you just need to check the \nWrap around checkbox.. >Without this checked, it does not replace all as it should.\nI think it does what it has to, taking into accout that there is this checkbox available.\nAlso the find function works this way - from cursor position to either start or end of document,\nif whole document should be affected, check wrap around.\nI disagree saying this is a bug and think this issue can be closed to be honest.. Sorry, I didn't make clear that I was referring to the find next (or the << and >>) button(s) within the replace tab.. Because there is not much info I have to guess that OP wants to have the shell lexer modified.\nAs this is part of scintilla project and not handled by npp directly this issue should be closed.. duplicate, should be closed\nSee #3562 - update/upvote accordingly. I'm able to open files bigger than 200MBytes and without the mentioned crash so it must be specific to\nyour setup or kind of files you open.\nDid you try to open the file with a bare minimum npp aka starting with -noPlugin switch?\nDoes the file contain end of line chars, meaning it isn't just a one-liner?\nIs it really a text file and doesn't have binary content?. Probably you activated autodetect character encoding under Settings-> Misc. Can this be?. Well that is exactly the issue - to few chars to detect an encoding.\nThe used detection library is, by the way, mozillas chardet lib.. Just another check: you know that you can modify the context menu of the document?\nNot the tab context menu.\n. Just for clarification as I'm unsure about your respond on my comment.\nYou can have what you want in the context menu of the document right now\nbut not in the context menu of the tab.. Isn't this something for the authorof this plugin\nor do I miss something here?\nIf it is feature request for DSpellCheck plugin then I would ask for closing this issue.. Imho issue should be closed as it works as designed and because even if you think about it how should\nnpp know which part needs to be styled and how if the file does not contain any information what has been styled before. Let's assume for a moment that the file has the content Hello World and one modifies\nit to Hello Walter and styles the word Walter - how should a reload act on this?. It is designed this way - reloading a file means creating a new scintilla document.\nI see and agree that this might be a nice feature for your use case but technically you are looking for \na lexer like those in the language menu. \nSo it only remains for me to wish you luck that this will be implemented. :-). Imho a macro is dump it takes what it got and executes it.\nIf you need logic then you need some kind of scripting language and\nthere are plenty available as plugins using languages like python, lua, c#, java, ...\nFrom my point of view this issue should be closed.. If you want to have a macro to behave more intelligent, than you have to define its behavior which means\nyou need to describe how to use it and under which circumstances - in code. \nIn this context, assuming that one wants to execute the macro in documents which do NOT contain \na particular text is as valid as one wants to run the macro if it HAS the text looking for.\nHow could we know beforehand? \nConcerning learning new things - how could we know what is easy for one and what isn't?\nI'm pretty confused about your smacks of elitism remark - I do not know where you are coming from\nbut as long as you have access to the internet EVERYONE has access to mostly anything you can think of.\n. @deadeyelo \nFor info, I am neither part of the developers nor do I have any influence on what will be changed to Notepad++ and furthermore I am not using Npp for quite some time so I am not quite up to date.\nHowever the topic interests me, - I understand the desire to have more control over macros but I do not know how to do that without changing the whole macro concept.\nHow should the logic decide whether, for example, finding a string is an error or not.\nLet's say Npp has this option to check if something was found and would cancel if nothing was found. What would you answer to someone who approaches with a request to execute a macro only if the requested text is NOT present in the text?\nTo realize such a thing it needs, in my opinion, a kind of flow control which would mean,\nfor example, while recording with each step it can be defined whether the next step, in the case of an error, should be executed or not. Sounds very much like a scripting language to me.\nAs said, just my opinion and I hope for you that the developers will consider such functionality but\nthis sounds like a lot of work to be done for something which could be solved by existing scripting languages already.. Agreed, I just kept the style as used in addExt function. Should both be changed?. ",

Basically i don't want to see any company name in context menu from a fresh Notepad++ installation.\nFirefox have for a long time use google as the default search engine and got a lot of money for it but its annoying when you dont want to use google that google is there as default choice.\nYou could make a setting to have the user select a search engine from a list and until the users have selected one the search menu item does not appear, but please don't make google or other the default like in Firefox because its annoying when you try to avoid certain companies with bad practices.\nI would prefer that no search engine was the default.\nBut i never really used the context menu search so i don't know what would be best for the users that does use it.\n. I guess if the user would like to open the file in another browser then the four browsers in the list its not possible in the menu.\n. \n. I use standard 96 dpi (100%) in controlpanel screen settings.\n. It seems the square part you slide is small with Aero and Basic theme, but big with Classic theme.\n\nBut if Notepad++ is open and i'm using Aero/Basic theme, then switch to Classic theme, the square bit keeps to same small size, until i restart Notepad++, then it goes back to the big square.\n\nSame thing the other way around if i start Notepad++ during Classic theme, i have the big square, then if i switch to Aero/Basic theme it keeps the big square size (with bottom cut off), until i restart Notepad++.\n\n. Can you give some examples where you think they are necessary?\n. Make it possible to translate the string \"plugins\" yes.\n. I don't think this qualifies as an issues but i would like to see a page being made where people could write what platform they would like to see Notepad++ on.\nAnd where questions like this would be answers like:\nQ: Will Notepad++ be available on iPhone\nA: Of course not\nSo when people want to know other people could redirect to that page with the answers.\n. Why not add the nessesary space inside the GUI so all strings says \"X:\" without space instead of some saying \"X: \" with space and others say \"X:\" without space?\n. The string seem to be here:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/51797bf59e689b11d80998758790f8a4cade68eb/PowerEditor/src/tools/NppShell/src/NppShell.cpp#L23\nPerhaps better to call it \"Open with...\" or \"Open i...\" instead of edit. What ever why Windows writes it in the context menu.\nAnd you might just want to see the file without editing it so i suppose \"open\" is more correct.. Why reject?\nWould it not be better to use the same style in all string instead og extra spaces in some strings?. I suppose Notepad++ should follow the Microsoft way if the software can only be used on Windows system.\nAnyone know of Microsoft software where we can see what they use? Software that can have multiple files opened.. Can you write a reason for reject?. popcorner wrote this in a pulll request that was closed:\n\nActually, Mac might be an outdated name.\nApple called it Mac OS many years ago\nand then renamed it to OSX\nnow it is called macOS\n\uff08change mac to lowercase and remove the space\uff09\n\n\nI don't know what the correct mac word would be.\nBut i think \"Convert to Mac Format\" is referring to a way of new lines used in old Mac systems.\nThey used \"\\r\" on old Mac system i believe but have switched to using \"\\n\" like Linux years ago i think but i'm not sure.\nMaybe \"Classic Mac\" or what ever is most commonly used in other editors.\n. If i enable show all characters i can see the newlines.\nSome lines end with CFLF and others end with LF.\nIt seem the LF is inserted at the beginning of the highlighted text copied from the result for the string i have searched for.\nSo if i search in all files for \"abc\" the search result might have:\nsome text some text some text some text abc some text some text\n\"abc\" is highlighted in the search result so on copy paste it (sometimes) becomes:\nsome text some text some text some text [LF]\nabc some text some text\nWhen the tab is set to Windows newlines (CR LF) or Mac (CR) the sorting command do not sort correct as the lines are seen on the screen because they dont sort lines ending with LF.\nBut when the tab is set to Linux [LF] it sorts correctly as seen on screen because each line ends with LF.\nSo i guess the question is:\nWhy does LF get inserted before highlighted search text when copied from search reasult.\nAnd why does it only happen some times.\nTry sorting this file when newlines is set to Windows of Mac.\nEnable show all characters so you can see the newlines.\nnotepadsortnewlineproblem.txt\n. The LF's comes from the search result highlights.\nSometimes.\nI made a little mistake in the above where is says some text [LF] abc but i have fixed it now.\nSee the [LF] right before \"abc\" on the next line. That [LF] comes from the search results when i have searched for \"abc\" in all files (Ctrl+Shift+F) and then copy all the text in the search result and paste it in the tab.\nThe sorting properly works because Notepad++ openes the file with Unix newlines (which works).\nSo open the file, convert to Windows og Mac newlines.\nThen Undo.\nThen sort does not work.. It only happens sometimes it seems when copying from the result list.\nBut you can try the other thing i described using the file i uploaded.. I see two problems.\n1: Sometimes [LF] from search result highlights gets copy pasted into tab even though there are no reason why a [LF] should be there at the beginning of each highlight when copy pasting.\n2: Notepad++ shows [LF] and [CR] as newlines in the tab even though the newline setting is set to use Windows style [CRLF]. So if the tab is set to use Windows newlines then why does Notepad++ show both [LF] and [CR] as newlines? It should not.. So how do i remove words in the find if not Ctrl+backspace?\nI need to remove words a lot in the find dialog so i would really for this to be possible.. I guess im just used deleting words with Ctrl+Backspace from Firefox so i thought that was the norm.\nBut i see Windows 7 insert that 7f character but when editing document and in search dialog.\nIf there is a way to delete words i would like to know.. Perhaps the title \"Are you sure?\" should be something else as the message is also a question:\n<SCMapperDoDeleteOrNot title=\"Are you sure?\" message=\"Are you sure you want to delete this shortcut?\"/>\nMaybe \"Confirm delete/Confirmation/Delete shortcut\" something like that..

What is the use of a message NPPN_FILEOPENED when API calls after that message don't work on the file just opened.\n. I gladly help to fix this problem. But I would first like to know what @donho thinks of this problem/question. If he thinks NPPN_FILEOPENED works as expected and won't except a PR, there is no use to use afford in creating one in the first place.

But maybe that is just me.\nYou're right that fixing it could break other plugins. Does anybody know a plugin that actually uses this message?\nAnd still curious what @donho thinks about this.\nAnyway, I will use the NPPN_BUFFERACTIVED message to get my plugin to work.\n. To make all the features I have planned by now for my plugin work NPPN_FILEOPENED is not enough and I do need the NPPN_BUFFERACTIVED message.\nSo since my personal need is gone to fix this problem (if that would be a wise thing to do in the first place because it might break other plugins) I think I will close this issue in a couple of days, unless someone want to keep it opened.\n. @linquize Thanks for the suggestion. Added with last commit\n. @linquize Yes, it does. That was the reason to create the PR: To eliminate the use of full paths in the shebangs. And to support more languages ;-)\nThe code first checks if the first two chars of the file are #! (the shebang magic number). If so it checks the first line for the various commonly used languages and their interpreters.\nAnd #!/usr/bin/env node matches those criteria, so it returns L_JAVASCRIPT.\n. Those plugins most likely need to be made aware of the new L_JAVASCRIPT language that was introduced in one of the latest version (not sure which one exactly, can't find it in the release notes sadly enough, haven't look at the code, assume it is since 6.8.4).\nThe L_JS apparently is now used for embedded JS (in html, with a gray background color) and the new one is used for standalone js files, with a white background color in the editor (at least in the default color scheme).\nYou need to contact the authors of those plugins to ask them to make their plugin aware of this new LangType. It is probably a small fix for them.\n. Related to this (or just the same...) When you select any other language like SQL and you save a file without giving a full filename the extension .sql is not added as well.. This bug is not fixed in 7.3.2!\nPlease re-open.\nThe bug mentioned as \"dup\" is another bug IMHO..

That would be a nice touch, but it would probably be better to just put them at the top of the list instead of filter them (there are some heretics who code in proportional fonts).\nThe way it can be done is to use PANOSE classification metadata within a font, but I don't know if Windows can access it natively.\n. @msavli\nYou can change the Compare shortcut yourself here:\nNastavitve > Bli\u017enjice... > Plugin commands > \"Compare\"\nIt would be near impossible to find a default shortcut that wouldn't cause a conflict in any language.\nPS: the letters used in shortcuts aren't case-sensitive.\n.

You're the man!\nJust one nitpick: could you make the minimum width between columns adjustable, or at least 2 chars by default?\n. You could try Incremental Search (Ctrl + Alt + I) if you don't need regex.\n. It would also be a good idea to have those other spaces as a separate item in Style Configurator, so that you can have normal spaces dimmed and special ones popping out.\n. Good idea. Although, in fairness, the whole dialogue should have been made dockable ages ago.\n. This is a separate issue. The files in my case are short, with UTF-8 characters appearing in the first few lines, and the encoding is detected as OEM-US, not ANSI, which would be the default fallback. Also, Wikipedia mentions that .nfo files historically use code page 437 (a.k.a. OEM-US).\nAll of this leads me to believe that there's a hardcoded rule in the source that tells N++ to open .nfo files as OEM-US instead of doing the actual encoding detection.. I think I've found the cause.. :+1:\n. I bump up the size of \"Indent guideline style\" as a workaround.\n. Rafael, ANSI is a misnomer for your system's codepage (https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/987), which is probably Windows-1252, which mostly coincides with ISO-8859-1.\n. It's been a pull request https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/707 for a couple of months now, but the powers that be have certain opinions.\n. :+1: It's completely disorienting. The fact that Microsoft uses it throughout Windows is a proof enough that it's a bad design :-p\n. Related: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/482\n. Since you're more interested in generic paragraph symbol than the actual characters it sounds like you're actually worried about trailing whitespaces. If that's the case, you can check out the option to \u201cShow White Space and TAB\u201d only (no EOL), in Settings\u00a0\u2192 Shortcut Mapper.\nHaving said that, you're right about EOL symbols needing a less ugly design and a separate option in Style Configurator.\n. Arrows work with Shift + Alt.\n. That's a good idea: at the top of the Language dropdown, with a separator line after it. I also remember having trouble finding it the first time.\nAnd shouldn't it be called \"Plain text\" in English? Or maybe \"None\" since it's not really a \"language\"?\n. I meant start it minimized. I set it up to run at Windows startup and the usual \"Run: Minimized\" option in shortcut Properties doesn't work.\n. I think this is by design. You will notice that it only happens at the beginning of the line; that is, only when there is nothing except some combination of spaces and tabs between the beginning of the line and the caret. It seems to be a safeguard against mixing tabs and spaces, while still allowing you to use tabs for indentation correctly (i.e. tabs for current indent level and spaces for further alignment).\nBy the way, using tabs anywhere else but the beginning is a bad idea because they will always reach only the next global multiple of your preferred width, and there's no way you can manually assure they will work well for different tab widths. To get around that you need elastic tabstops, which are unfortunately still not natively implemented in any editor, as far as I know.\n. ",

However, I think with a bit of luck, this should be automatically taken care of in the new plugin admin system.  \nWhen you release a new plugin there (i.e. by changing the current version number, and updating the download / install steps), it could automatically be announced via (for example) twitter. Possibly also in the gitter/slack channel.  After a few days it would then automatically be available via PM. Hopefully, if we can manage it, it will be available (almost) immediately via PM under a flag in PM (\"allow install of newly released, untested plugins\" or some such setting in the config).  \nThis isn't all going to come at once, but that would be one nice way to do it.\n. Hi, plugin manager author here.\nTL;DR:  I'm sorry. If you want to help you can. It's going to get better by or in Janauary.\nFirstly, I apologise for the frustration I've caused. The releases are still a fair bit of work, as each update needs to be checked, and around 40% generally need correcting.  I appreciate that's probably due to it not being super-easy to test the changes. It's actually not too bad, just download the testing version and add two lines in your PluginManager.ini, but a lot of plugin devs don't seem to do it. Probably because they know it won't be released quickly.\nIf anyone from the community wants to be added to the people that can do the releases, I'm more than happy to walk someone through the process, and provide my scripts etc that I use. Please reply to this issue you want to take this on.\nTo address the point of a github hosted list - we did that originally, and whilst I did receive a few pull requests, it was significantly more work, and I think there were only about 6 people that contributed - that from a base of over a hundred plugin developers. Today, pretty much all changes are made by the plugin developers themselves.  \nMy primary concern currently is getting off sourceforge. I've written a new \"plugins\" server, and lined up a sponsorship deal for the hosting (I've talked before about this, but in a month with a release, the tiny plugins zip creates about 800GB in traffic).  I've spoken to Github, and they wanted around $80 per month, which quite frankly, I'm not prepared to pay.\nThe new server should be live by/in January. This is specifically designed to ease the transition to a model where changes are automatically pushed to live, once they've been checked.  \nOnce that's live, I'll add a \"push live\" button to the admin system for admins, so that people can easily push all changes live. Unfortunately, with the current setup, this cannot be available for everybody, as all plugins must be published at the same time. But, with 2 or 3 \"admins\", this should be a much quicker process.  Until that goes live, as I said earlier, anyone who wants to help with the current setup is more than welcome to.\nThe slightly longer term plan, which I've also talked about before, is to have an two-stage admin system, that individual plugin changes can be \"approved\", and then they are automatically pushed live at regular intervals.  That project is going quite well, but I admit it's fairly low priority at the moment.\nIf you've got  any comments on this, or wish to become an admin, please add a comment with your plugin admin system username, and we'll sort out a time to walk through the process.\n. One point I forgot - the stability ranking in plugin manager can be changed by anyone. I have on very rare occasions set it due to multiple reports of crashes. The author is free to set it back after fixing the issue(s).\n. @taras-b - The URL will stay the same, at least initially. \nStage 1 will just be an extra option for anyone that wants to help with a \"publish\" option, which will publish the entire plugins.xml as live.  Obviously this can't be for everyone, as whoever pushes that button needs to have tested all the updates for all the plugins since the last publish.\nStage 2 will be a new interface, hopefully with the couple of bits that are often missed/forgotten in the current interface made more obvious.  The idea will remain the same, but the interface might be a bit different. It's possible the URL will change, but I'll publicise that at the time, and create an automatic redirect from the old address.\n. ",

To fix the cosmetic issues would mean regressing on the improvements. I'd say this is probably a WONTFIX because the only other solution is to stop using Window's TabControl API.\nCheck issue #3273 for more info.. @reddyshyam I don't disagree with you, but I think most people would agree the uglier UI was worth the fixes to some very annoying issues. In any case, it's not like Npp's Windows 95 looking UI was particularly pretty or particularly modern to begin with. \ud83d\ude05. > Personally I find the buttons unpleasant.\nA theme might help. I use the Zenburn theme with modified tab colors.\nSettings->Style Configurator->Global Styles->Inactive tabs (Background= [More colors=160,0,59,63,63,63], Foreground =[40,45,200,220,220,204])\n\nThe buttons also feels (and possibly are) much \"noisier\" than normal tabs. Someone mentioned flat buttons, but I don't see where to enable it (looking at settings -> preferences -> general -> tab-bar).\n\nTCS_FLATBUTTONS has to be added in source during compile.\n\nCould someone please point to the issue/commit/discussions/reasons which resulted in changing the tabs to buttons? #3237 doesn't seem the reason to me but rather a result of this change, isn't it?\n\n@avih #3237 != #3273, it was posted at the bottom of #3273, issues : #917 #1096 #1787 #1960 #2241. @JStinebaugh @reddyshyam someone would need to make a PR for it.\nThe primary issue with the older tab layout was that rows weren't stationary when selected, they would move to the front/bottom row (and drag and drop was unusable when changing rows as a consequence of this behavior). It made it impossible to remember which row a specific tab is located because it's constantly moving around.\nHere's a gif displaying the described problem. Now imagine selecting tabs in random rows instead of only the top one. You'll have no idea where your tabs are located.\n\nimo, the old tab style was infuriating with multiple rows of tabs. I'd prefer the button style even if it was a lot uglier because at least it wasn't headache inducing.. As a user of the multi-line feature, I can tell you the previous multi-line behavior was far more annoying.\nThe rows moved around depending on which tab was selected, and this made it hard to keep track of where tabs are. As a consequence, tab reordering was quite broken anyway. If you tried to move a tab to a different row, it would rapidly spasm between different rows (since the selected tab's row is always shown at the bottom) and the end position of the moved tab became random.\nThe only way to stop selected tabs from moving to the bottom row was to change to the button style, which broke dragging tabs to reorder them (tabs can't be selected in the button style while tab reordering is enabled, so it's forced off).\nPerhaps someone can figure out a way to fix dragging tabs with the button style. Alternatively, hotkeys could be added or sorting buttons in npp's \"Window\" dialog.. @Archaeopteryx: What do you think of hijacking the shift+mwheel hotkey to move tabs? the ctrl+mwheel and ctrl+shift+mwheel hotkeys are similar to the shift+mwheel hotkey anyway.. @SinghRajenM @MAPJe71 @rddim @Archaeopteryx @speedy1701 I may have gotten drag and drop working with the new buttons style.\nCompile PR#3023 yourselves to test, or here's compiled binaries for other people.\nnotepad++ v7.3.3 (PR3023) x86.exe\nnotepad++ v7.3.3 (PR3023) x64.exe\n. @rddim Nice catch!

Multi-Line?\nThe tabs in multi-line are now buttons in order to maintain the active tab's row. Previously, the active tab's row moved to the front/bottom which is confusing and caused reordering/sorting of tabs to be difficult. The margins around button-tabs is an unfortunate limitation in Window's TabControl.\nIf you're referring to something else, then you'll want to provide screenshots.. > ### Could you explain more clearly why is it necessary to make tabs buttons\n\nThe tabs in multi-line are now buttons in order to maintain the active tab's row. Previously, the active tab's row moved to the front/bottom which is confusing and caused reordering/sorting of tabs to be difficult.\nwhy isn't it possible to solve that issue in another way?\n\nWindow's TabControl has no other way. The other solution is to replace Window's TabControl with something else entirely.. > It's not an explanation. It is description. The explanation is the cause of that reordering.\nI don't understand what you're saying. #917 #1096 #1787 #1960 #2241\n\nThe other solution is to replace Window's TabControl with something else entirely.\nSo why this way have not been chosen? \n\nSounds like a lot of work for a minor cosmetic problem. If you're up for the challenge and get something working, then you could always make a Pull Request.\n\nDo workarounds like creating an own TabControl instance per line and process dragging between different lines in npp code make much troubles?\n\nA hacky workaround like that may be possible, but if the resulting code is long, complicated and/or a noticeable performance hit, then it's probably not worth it.. I can't reproduce this problem in v7.4. Maybe upload an animated gif/video of the problem? And maybe a test file?. Fixed in v7.4.1. Dupe #3272. Dupe #804. I can't replicate this crash on Windows 10.\n\nNotepad++ v7.4.1   (32-bit)\nBuild time : May 18 2017 - 02:00:37\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 10 (64-bit)\nPlugins : mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExport.dll PluginManager.dll \n. To clarify, two distinct issues are visible by the UI hang depending on Doc peeker settings.\n\nDoc peeker enabled: all the tabs completely disappear.\nDoc peeker disabled: tab is shown selected, but the previous tab's document is shown.. I've never run into this issue using Notepad++. My initial guess would be hardware issues with your mouse or usb ports, but it's strange the issue subsides when restarting Notepad++.\nDoes the frozen left click affect OS activities as well (not just Notepad++)?. There's already some logic to prevent this problem. One would simply need to figure out why it isn't working. Maybe case sensitivity?. update notepad++. @irgendsontyp it can take a while, @donho generally reviews the PRs all at once.. You might want to try updating Notepad++. I can't replicate this problem. Installed 7.4.2 (x86) and replaced .exe with latest build 164e2c67\nWorks fine.. I'm aware of this bug. It's fairly easy to replicate.\nStep 1: Move a tab using drag and drop.\nStep 2: Use a tab switching hotkey/feature which doesn't set TCM_SETCURFOCUS AND TCM_SETCURSEL\nSome of the tab switching features include:\n\nMRU list (Ctrl+Tab or Right click+Scroll wheel)\nWindow->tab\nCtrl+Page Up/Down\n\n. I'll open a PR fixing this problem.. I got distracted, but PR #3552 is now up! The AppVeyor builds (x86 and x64) are also up.. I can't replicate this crash. Maybe try without plugins enabled?. @tuyethoa08041997 That's because the bug is only fixed in snapshot builds or releases v7.5.5 or newer. Unfortunately, v7.5.5 had a problem with macro recording, so I don't think it was made available through the auto-updater. You'll need to wait for v7.5.6 to be released.. v7.5.2-7.5.4 reintroduced DSpellCheck.dll as a default plugin.\nHowever, a242214a disabled it by default in v.7.5.5.. I just saw this issue and it's an easy fix. It might fix #3851 as well.\nI can't make a PR for it atm because my current PR (#4173) is using master. And I could be wrong, but I suspect that committing it to a separate branch would still get it pushed onto PR#4173. \u2639. That worked! Thanks.. This doesn't really help. You're supposed to initialize LVCOLUMN.cchTextMax when passing LVCOLUMN into something which writes to LVCOLUMN.pszText (for example TVM_GETITEM) or you get undefined behavior.\nIn any case, the discussion on LVCOLUMN is all kind of moot since LVCOLUMN.pszText won't be a const here if/when someone decides to add translations to the columns. ~~I might consider doing it myself if I have time.~~\nEdit: I added translations in 13801e3.. donho meant the PR will be merged once it's updated with changes from english.xml \ud83d\ude09. I don't see a reason to waste space in the Settings dialog. If the objective is to always use _wstat on non-XP 32bit, then might as well do something like:\n```\ninclude \nint winapi_wstat(wchar_t const _FileName, struct _stat _Stat)\n{\n    if (IsWindowsVistaOrGreater())\n        return _wstat(_FileName, _Stat);\n// rest of code\n\n}\n```. GetVersionEx is depreciated https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724451(v=vs.85).aspx\nI don't think the current code poses a problem (since it's not checking for specific versions of W8 or W10), but I wonder if we should be using the newer API functions when available.\nThere's also an existing more accurate implementation of version checking (which also uses GetVersionEx) in the form of NppParameters::getWindowsVersion, which means a little code duplication, since you can also do this:\n```\ninclude \nint winapi_wstat(wchar_t const _FileName, struct _stat _Stat)\n{\n    if ((NppParameters::getInstance())->getWinVersion() != WV_XP)\n        return _wstat(_FileName, _Stat);\n// rest of code\n\n}\n```. Does Npp work again after resuming the process in Resource Monitor (steps: Task Manger -> Performance -> Open Resource Monitor -> Right click process -> Resume Process)?\nAlternatively, I recently fixed a problem with LockWindowUpdate in PR#4611 which exhibited behavior which could be mistaken for a frozen/hung process. You could try the following: keep Npp open (not minimized) and click on the desktop wallpaper or somewhere on task bar (click Windows audio slider popup or time/date to open Windows calendar popup) and check whether Npp functionality is restored.. What kind of crash? Does notepad++ close itself? Does the Tab Bar freeze? Do you get an error message?. Does it crash without the DSpellCheck plugin?. Settings->General->Document List Panel->Show \u2714\nCTRL + SHIFT + Page Up / Page Down hotkey to re-arrange while tab bar is hidden. Otherwise you can use tab bar to re-arrange in Doc Switcher.. I can't replicate this issue. Try out a fresh portable copy extracted to a random directory so it's using stock settings, does the crash still happen?. Can I see debug info on the portable copy to ensure \"Local Conf mode : ON\"?\nAlso, what's your windows version and build as shown on winver?. Based on the Version, I'm guessing Win10 Enterprise or Education? I wonder if anyone else has a working copy they could use to check whether the crashes also happen on their Win10 Enterprise/Education. Otherwise I'll probably grab an evaluation copy of Win10 Enterprise to check myself.. The patch works. Npp x86 wasn't crashing on my systems though. The issue manifested itself in the form of the \"Name\" column's label vanishing. . Done!. Couldn't you simply store APPVERSION in config.xml and open change.log if it differs?\nNpp would only need to be launched once through explorer. You wouldn't need to mess with shortcuts or parameters. It also wouldn't re-open change.log for non-clean reinstalls (which is probably good, since I doubt they'd be interested).\nThis solution would only cause problems if someone actively switched back and forth between two versions of Npp on the same config.xml. I'd be interested in knowing why someone would do that outside of testing. Though you could always check whether they launched from the right install path (when not doLocalConf.xml).. The return is signed, so it's making sure the high-order bit isn't set \ud83d\ude0a. ON and Toggle ON will both be negative values, while OFF & Toggle OFF is 0 and 1 respectively. The way I'm checking works for any signed datatype.\nThe alternatives is either two conditions or a negated bitwise AND check for ON. The end result is the same either way.. done. ",

I never did it due to lack of time and some health issues that affected my productivity.\nSince I recently resumed my work on UDL, I am OK with putting new link into into UDL GUI. Check with Don Ho if that's OK with him too.\nHere are relevant source files (search for 'weebly' string):\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/ScitillaComponent/UserDefineDialog.cpp\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/ScitillaComponent/UserDefineDialog.rc\nBest regards\nIvan Radic. Regarding UDL3. This is an ongoing task (recently resumed after longer break caused by burnout and health issues), that is kept in unpublished private repository.\nThere won't be any news or updates about it until I finish it.\nBest regards\nIvan Radic. Thanks for notification @donho  and thanks to @ssk97  for the fix.\nI agree that \"true\" should be replaced with EOL_SKIP_CHECK. Variable checkEOL used to be bool, but got converted to int during development. I wonder why compiler never warned about implicit conversion??\nAnyway, looking at the code variable checkEOL is used to force EOL processing when Delimiter close statement \"consumes\" EOL. Typical example are line comments, EOL is consumed by line comment (or delimiter that is closed by ((EOL)) special character).\nOf top of my head, I don't remember why was it necessary to skip EOL processing if Delimiter open and Folding keywords that are immediately followed by EOL char, but it obviously is missing for Opetaror1 stye. Thanks @ssk97 for finding that bug. First commit should be merged into main branch.\nAs for second commit, it is not good:\n`\n                         if (newState != SCE_USER_STYLE_COMMENTLINE || (sc.ch != '\\r' && sc.ch != '\\n'))\n                             sc.Forward(iter->length());\n-                        if (sc.atLineStart)\n-                            checkEOL = EOL_FORCE_CHECK;\n+                        if (sc.atLineEnd)\n+                            checkEOL = EOL_SKIP_CHECK;\n`\nEOL at the end of line comments is not \"skipped forward\" because of potential nested line comment sequence. Therefore, we can't check atLineEnd but must instead rely on atLineStart which is safe even in case of multiple nested line comments.. Long story short: use first commit, discard second one. Some basic testing in pre-release phase by beta testers would be wise.\nBest regards,\nIvan. ",

They can reshack notepad++.exe by themselves, it's a one-liner batch command.\n- Choose whether to create shortcuts for current user or all users. Currently, if user has admin rights the shortcuts are created for all users, otherwise they are created for current user. There is just no reason for this.\n. Do you agree with the suggestions I have made above?\n. Does someone know if we should add Windows 8.1 to this part? (desktop shortcut checked by default on Windows 8)\n. Have a look at:\n- 6.7.4 release\n- Notepad_plus::showQuoteFromIndex\n- and especially Notepad_plus::threadTextPlayer\n. Same as #293.\n. Hadn't noticed https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/901f772e5498b6d84555b8fde52e7e6236004511.\n. Thanks for the tip, however I'd like to install as few plugins as possible.\n. If I configure a timeout, it is properly saved when exiting Notepad++.\nThen I open Notepad++ again, the timeout is 0 instead of configured value, and this 0 is saved when exiting again.\nSo the problem should be somewhere about config reading.\n(Notepad++ 6.8.8, NppFTP 0.26.5)\n. Also, isn't timeout 0 supposed to mean \"no timeout\"?\n. This is a feature. Since version 6.8.4, Notepad++ manages separately .js files and embedded JavaScript, so you can apply different styling to them.\n. Ah, and I'm using ZenBurn theme. Looks like it's a theme issue.\n. It's in fact due to the implementation of JSON highlighting, which has been separated from JavaScript highlighting.\nThemes would need updating, but another solution could be to fallback to JavaScript if the theme doesn't have JSON rules, like it has been done for embedded JavaScript.\n. Writing a JSON ruleset for Zenburn theme, I encountered the following issues about JSON highlighting:\n- can't figure out where the CHARACTER rule is applied\n- can't style these valid JSON values: true, false, null\n. Thanks :)\nHow about my above suggestion, fallbacking to the JavaScript rules if the theme doesn't have rules for JSON?\n\nThemes would need updating, but another solution could be to fallback to JavaScript if the theme doesn't have JSON rules, like it has been done for embedded JavaScript.\n. Can't reproduce either. Using Notepad++ 6.8.8.\n. You can add the following in %AppData%\\Notepad++\\shortcuts.xml:\n\n<Command name=\"Bing Search\" Ctrl=\"no\" Alt=\"no\" Shift=\"no\" Key=\"0\">https://www.bing.com/search?q=$(CURRENT_WORD)</Command>\nThen in %AppData%\\Notepad++\\contextMenu.xml:\n<Item MenuEntryName=\"Run\" MenuItemName=\"Bing Search\"/>\n. In %AppData%\\Notepad++ directory, what's the content of shortcut.xml? Anything else missing?\n. And <macros> and <UserDefinedCommands> sections are empty? That's strange. But unless there is a way to reproduce the issue, I doubt this could be fixed.\nMeanwhile, you could repair by copying back the original file to %AppData%\\Notepad++.\nAnother possibility, maybe %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Notepad++\\shortcuts.xml was altered? This one isn't supposed to be modified.\n. To clarify: the issue is in the status bar, where the number of lines doesn't fit.\nLooks like it's due to the DPI scaling.\n. This message is shown by FileManager::loadFileData, there are 2 occurrences of it in the code.\nIt appears when:\n- File size exceeds the 32-bit limit\n- Some exception occurred\nI'm getting this message too, though the file is less than 2 GB. So I deduce I'm hitting an exception.\nIf the computer is idle, the message doesn't appear instantaneously, but quite fast. But if the computer is under load, it can hang for much time.\n. Bump. Low-hanging fruit here :)\n. What do you mean by \"autoit.xml is not in the repository\"?\n. Maybe Don HO looked too fast and didn't notice I'm adding the file :-)\nBy the way, the file is a bit large (just below 1 MB), but:\n- It's very acceptable considering today's drives, and compared to the size of the bloat added by almost all softwares nowadays.\n- It's tiny once compressed (84 KB), thanks to #2175 :-)\n. - My PR is still up-to-date and could be reopened. But if you have ideas for improvements, don't hesitate to open another PR.\n- -1 for the LF endings. Sounded great at first glance, but inconsistent with all other *.xml files and more importantly it's not compatible with classic Notepad.\n. Agree that clicking on a tab shouldn't change rows order.\n. @jtrent238, I'm unsure, is it irony? Seriously, this charset thing already has caused me many troubles\u2026\n. I encounter the same behaviour using a fresh settings profile.\n. \"New > Text Document\". You get a 0-bytes empty \"New Text Document.txt\" file. Then you open this file with Notepad++.\nThen please someone delete all this spam.\n. Possible fix in #2997.. Maybe you have the \"regular expression\" search mode selected?\nIt also happens to me sometimes\u2026\n. The screenshot above is incorrect, as the issue happens when there is a space between function name and opening parenthesis.\nSo, I could reproduce the issue. I tried before and after #2335, fails in both.\nThe issue happens only if the function is global, it doesn't happen if it is defined inside a class.. Didn't notice there was a second issue.\nCurrent code is correct though. \"static function\" is valid only for class methods, not global functions.. This case is supposedly fixed, you are probably using an older functionList.xml file (location: C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Notepad++\\functionList.xml). If I recall correctly, Notepad++ doesn't replace it when updating the program. So, try manually replacing this file with the latest one.. We should emphasize that Macintosh actually uses LF.\nMaybe we could just drop the CR option?\n. How about this?\nWindows (CR LF)\nUnix / Mac (LF)\nOld Mac (CR)\nThe important part is to not trick Mac users into using CR.\nAlso, many Mac users probably don't know they are using a Unix system.\n. > I totally agree, however most Mac users probably don't know the difference between \"Mac\" vs \"Old Mac\" (although maybe they do? I'm not a Mac person :) ).\nAgree, I just tried to get a concise result, and I got not satisfying result using \"Mac OS X\" or \"OS X\".\nThat's why I suggested above to remove the CR mode.\nUseless (unless proven otherwise), no more confusion to worry about.\n. > However, I doubt this is the way to do it.\n\u2026 but it is!\n. As long as the FileDescription is shortened I'm fine :)\nI leave it for Don Ho to decide about the other changes.\n. I don't know about Windows 10, but I'm encountering this on Windows 7 (and previously on Windows XP, fwiw).\nAlso here is a context menu screenshot:\n. I would really appreciate if this PR could be considered again.\nSee in particular my latest screenshot above, which I posted after the PR had been rejected.. Another example, for a XML file:\n. Indeed, this functionality would be very helpful.\n. Agree with MAPJe71, this button is useful.\nI think Skip Replacement would be misleading as the button can be used to reach the first candidate. So this button is more of a \"reach next\" rather than \"leave current\".\nHowever, I think Find Next brings confusion with the regular \"find\" functionality.\nMay I suggest Go to Next?\n. Just as a reminder, you can use Ctrl + numpad \"/\" to reset the zoom.\n. Also reported in #981, #1103\u2026. For the PHP parser:\n Looks like it has been copied from the C/C++ parser, and some stuff could be removed: double colon ::, pointers *.\n The repeating (function\\s+)+ seems pointless\n As commented above, why supporting invalid function names?\n Tweaked regex for the optional \"static/public/etc.\" keywords\nBefore:\nmainExpr=\"^\\s*((static|public|protected|private|final)*(\\s+(static|public|protected|private|final))+\\s+)?(function\\s+)+(\\w+(\\s+\\w+)?(\\s+|\\*\\s+|\\s+\\*|\\s+\\*\\s+))?(\\w+\\s*::)?(?!(if|while|for|switch))[\\w~]+\\s*\\([^\\{]*\\{\"\nAfter:\nmainExpr=\"^\\s*((static|public|protected|private|final)\\s+)*function\\s+\\w+\\s*\\([^\\{]+\\{\". With the added section \"un.onUninstSuccess\", isn't the \"Remove remaining directories\" part, at the very end of the file, now redundant?. I can reproduce it. Windows 7 (64-bit) with Notepad++ 7.3.1 (32 bit).\n\nActually there are several bugs:\n Toolbar missing\n Plugin panes missing (Light Explorer and SourceCookifier), but look at the small bits of them at top left and top right of window\n* Status bar background missing\nIf this can help to debug, I noticed the bug happens only the first time:\n Start Notepad++, minimize to tray, restore : bug\n Minimize again to tray, restore : still bug\n Switch window size from \"maximized\" to \"normal\" (then back to maximized if you wish):\n  * fixes the display\n  * the bug doesn't occur anymore when minimizing to tray / restoring. It seems to be standard, judging by these references:\n I have \"Window\" too e.g. in SmartGit (screenshot)\n Search \"Menu category names\" in these Microsoft guidelines\n See also these Apple guidelines. Also refs the related #2523.\nThankfully, this PR doesn't have any conflict with it :). Updated commit: for JavaScript I replaced[A-Za-z_]\\w* with [A-Za-z_$]\\w*.\n\u2013 edit: then again, with [A-Za-z_$][\\w$]*\n\nEach identifier must start with a letter, the dollar sign ($) or the underscore character (_) and must never start with a digit (such as 0-1) or some of the other characters such as punctuation signs and a few others. Actually there is some other stuff that could be picked from #2012.. It's a bit complicated\u2026 I'll leave the PR as it is currently, I don't want to introduce any half-thought change. It still brings a handful of improvements.. Of course, you might want to factorize this code from loadFile and reloadBuffer into a separate method.. I cannot compile, I just copied the existing code.\n\n\nCan you reproduce the bugs, at least the first one?\nWhat's your opinion about dropping getHtmlXmlEncoding as I described at the end of my first post?. Great coincidence: maybe my recent #2633 would fix this.. The problem is probably in Scintilla, see Editor::MoveSelectedLines in Editor.cxx.. I reported this issue to the Scintilla team.\n\nTicket on the prehistoric SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/bugs/1892/. As discussed on the paleolithic SourceForge, this behavior is actually expected.. 390 lines at once\u2026\n. It works here. Could you provide an example of failing JavaScript content?. Mmm, right.\nApparently it's a regression introduced in 5d438aa08250e3389a77cd3635763ac4c20a36be.. Duplicate of #1874, possible fix in #2997.. Pending fix in #2621.. When resizing the dialog, texts in all input boxes become selected.\n(it doesn't happen on the \"Find\" tab, the issue seems a bit different on the \"Find what:\" input). +1 on the principle. Not remembering the empty string surprised me many times.. Previously, I was thinking the same as you, but I've changed my mind:\nDoing \"Close all but this one\" then closing the remaining tab by a middle click isn't that tedious, and I think it's better than adding an item to an already heavy menu.\nAlso note your requested feature can be \"emulated\" as I described, whereas other commands (\"Close to left\", \"Close this one\", etc.) cannot be emulated likewise.\nFinally, but it's a different subject, it would be great to be able to customize this menu, like it's already possible for the edit zone context menu.. Thanks for having a look at it :)\nBut with this patch, if some text had been selected before resizing, will this selection be discarded?. So if I understood correctly, the issue would be fixed if there is no selection, but would still be present if there is a selection.\nStill an improvement, as I suppose most of the time there is no selection.\nI guess fixing all cases would require saving then restoring the selection? It would be probably worth it, though I can't say about coding difficulty, and performances.\nBut maybe someone is more familiar with WinApi and knows a way to fix this at the root?. That's what I meant: partial selection gets lost. It is clearly visible on your great gif.\nFixing this might help in some cases (e.g. cut/copy using right-clic menu, which doesn't take focus), but code complexity and performance should be considered, and as you said, many \"focus change\" scenarios already happen and alter the selection.\nSo, the situation should be good enough with this patch. I'm already happy this dialog is becoming resizable :). The kind of small change that greatly improves the workflow. Thanks :). Refs the PR by luisffranca: #3898. Bump, this one is an easy pick :). As I wrote in https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/1618#issuecomment-243354057, 1\u00a0MB is nothing nowadays, and compressed into the installer it only adds about 85\u00a0KB.\nBut I understand your position, and I can share it (I was a bit uncertain too about adding this file).. Refs #323, #2944 and #3774.. That may be because Notepad++ is precisely using the config file you are editing, so when you close Notepad++ it overwrites the file.\nMake a copy of the file and edit this copy, then close Notepad++ and replace the main file with the copy.. Another nitpick: fix case \"Search On Internet\" \u2192 \"Search on Internet\"\n(no change in practice, because the corresponding menu item was already with lowercase \"on\"). I do maintain this menu entry is not worth it.\nFor me this is pretty clear, and I don't plan to argue about it.\n\"Less is more\" principle, keeping such useless entry make the useful entries harder to spot.\nBut it's up to you :). If today, in a parallel universe, this entry was not present and there were a PR to add such an entry, would you accept it?\nThe Safari entry has been added along the Chrome one, in 2009 (at that time, Chrome was pretty new, far from the popularity it has now).. Was for consistency with the strings at the other places. This is actually a regression from 213af533899b720fa2abcdd4abcc2f3c577d8d7b, where the text has been changed from \"Mark: N\u00a0matches.\" to \"N\u00a0matches.\"\n(search for \"find-status-mark-\" in FindReplaceDlg.cpp and english.xml)\nAs it's inconsistent with the other status bar strings, I guess this missing \"Mark: \" is actually an overlook.\n The slight crop at the beginning is probably a different, longer-standing issue.\n. I don't think it's related to optimization. Maybe you could add regression and translation instead.. I don't think it's related to optimization ;). Rebased :). This would be consistent with \"Find in Files > Replace in Files\" which already has a confirmation dialog.\nOn the other hand, a mistake with \"Replace All in All Opened Documents\" is not a disaster (you can undo the changes and the files are not saved) whereas \"Find in Files > Replace in Files\" is quite dangerous (not undoable, files saved in the process).\nAlso, maybe the two dialogs could be uniformized a bit (for example one has Yes/No the other has OK/Cancel).. I'd tend to agree with the addition of this dialog.\nI use a lot the \"Replace All\" feature, but much less the \"Replace All in All Opened Documents\" feature, and when I do it's for \"large works\" (refactoring, etc) where an additional prompt doesn't add much time to the total time spent on the task.. Personally I'd vote for OK/Cancel, because Yes/No is a choice between two options, whereas OK is for confirming (\"go forward\") and Cancel is a \"do nothing, panic escape\" action.\nBut this could be debated for ages, let's be happy as long as the two dialogs are consistent :). On a related note, on program update the directory plugins\\APIs is emptied but not deleted. Maybe this could be fixed in autoCompletion.nsh :). If the issue has been introduced in 7.6,\nI see two possible culprits: ac09857656caf15752ea170d9cd4a080a6a58147 and/or bfb7e863cc6cd20f9f32389bee289607a212b12b\nping @CookiePLMonster :). I have compiled nightly of uchardet using these instructions and tried it.\nSadly it seems to also have the issue, and to be even worse\u2026\nuchardet nightly:\n \u00e9\u00e9\u00e9: UTF-8\n ex\u00e9cuter: WINDOWS 1250\n ex\u00e9cute: WINDOWS 1250\n x\u00e9cuter: IBM852\nNotepad++ 7.6.3 (uchardet 0.0.6):\n \u00e9\u00e9\u00e9: UTF-8\n ex\u00e9cuter: ISO 8859-9\n ex\u00e9cute: UTF-8\n x\u00e9cuter: UTF-8. Apparently the issues happen only on Windows builds,\nso there should be some obscure bug on the uchardet side that really should be found and fixed\u2026\nMeanwhile, would it be technically doable to manually increase the priority of UTF-8? :thinking:\nAs an ugly, ugly and ashaming workaround. :sweat_smile:. I updated Notepad++, with all the autoCompletion boxes checked.\nThe installer put all new files into $INSTDIR\\autoCompletion, and removed the corresponding files from $INSTDIR\\plugins\\APIs. As a result the latter got entirely emptied.. My head already hurts enough. Something like this?\n```nsis\nVar autocompleteNSIS\nStrCpy $autocompleteNSIS \"false\"\n${MementoSection} \"NSIS\" NSIS\n    StrCpy $autocompleteNSIS \"true\"\n${MementoSectionEnd}\nDelete \"$INSTDIR\\plugins\\APIs\\nsis.xml\"\n${If} $autocompleteNSIS == \"true\"\n    SetOutPath \"$INSTDIR\\autoCompletion\"\n    File \".\\APIs\\nsis.xml\"\n${Else}\n    Delete \"$INSTDIR\\autoCompletion\\nsis.xml\"\n${EndIf}\n```\nI'm removing the old files by purpose. Better having the newest files than obsolete files. If ever the user has customized a file on its own, he should be aware the installer replaces the content of \"%ProgramFiles%\\Notepad++\".\nping again @SinghRajenM :D. * Removing directory if empty (can't harm) and deleting files if unchecked are two different issues.\n My PR was for deleting the old directory if empty.\n I'd suggest removing that SetOverwrite off switching that SetOverwrite from off to on.\n* Indeed, code should be factorized if possible.. The code factorization may be something like:\n```nsis\nVar /GLOBAL autocompleteState\n!macro autocompleteFile name file\n    StrCpy $autocompleteState \"false\"\n    ${MementoSection} \"${name}\" name\n        StrCpy $autocompleteState \"true\"\n    ${MementoSectionEnd}\nDelete \"$INSTDIR\\plugins\\APIs\\${file}\"\n\n${If} $autocompleteState == \"true\"\n    SetOutPath \"$INSTDIR\\autoCompletion\"\n    File \".\\APIs\\${file}\"\n${Else}\n    Delete \"$INSTDIR\\autoCompletion\\${file}\"\n${EndIf}\n\n!macroend\n!insertmacro autocompleteFile C \"c.xml\"\n!insertmacro autocompleteFile C++ \"cpp.xml\"\n!insertmacro autocompleteFile Java \"java.xml\"\n!insertmacro autocompleteFile C# \"cs.xml\"\n!insertmacro autocompleteFile HTML \"html.xml\"\n``\nMy NSIS is rusty (and TBH, NSIS language is shitty), the above code probably has syntax errors (I mainly think of the \"name\" parameter).. On the other hand, invalid function names (reserved word, starts with a digit) can't be used and would crash, so what's the benefit of adding code to hide them? It could even be counterproductive (hide bug).. We can omit this in the PHP parser, though it should be necessary for the C parsers as there is nofunction` word to avoid ambiguity.. ",

Hi,\nI tried a file like this, and I saw no problem: \n...\nC:\\Users\\Tony\\Desktop\\C$\\temp\n...\nTried open the file both from the file dialog, and from double-clicking.. I have a question regarding the All option. I suppose when you search using Up, it will search until top is reached and then stop, and in the same way, you select Down it will search to end and then stop.\nThe All option I suppose would search down incrementally, but won't stop at the last line. But what if you want to incrementally search upwards and still continue searching after the first line,, then you have to change the option from from Up to All then.\nA solution would be to simply mark when end or beginning of document has been reached, in the status bar for example, and then continue to the next search, like it is done in Office suites.\nAnother question is what you mean with \"I can easily access it on the status bar across many documents while working on multiple documents.\". As I can't access Find dialog from status bar.. Never mind, Found the search from status bar pushing CRL-ALT-I. Still don't understand this feature, since there is an option both backwards, and forward. It also shows when beginning or end of document is reached.. Before and after:\n\n\n. Partly swedish.\nhttps://ibb.co/fBRLXa\n. Introduced a option \"Replace backwards\" to solve number 4.\nTranslation ids are included in english and swedish.\nNumber 3 is fixed as well as far as I have tested.\n.

Updated commit now, using Scintillas function SCI_BRACEMATCH which takes into consideration the styling of the brackets as well.. Added a margin of 7 points. Too big or too small?\n\n. There is a progress bar at the bottom of the find dialog, and showing the remaining time of the search/count/replace operation.\nThe message queue is processed inbetween every  100th found occurance, making the find dialog non-blocking. All buttons but the close button is disabled during find. Pressing close cancels the operation and closes the dialog.\n. \n. Currently show progress for each individual file while doing Find in Files. Perhaps not really consistant.\nI see some options:\n- Remove progress for individual files while doing Find in Files.\n- Remove Find in files progress and just use progressbar in Find dialog\n- Keep both but add the filename to status bar showing progress of individual file. Find/Replace/Mark: Will show remaining time, and pressing close in find dialog will cancel the operation. As a note, the replace operation can be cancelled mid-replace, without reversing the allready replaced items.\n\nFind in files: Will update the status bar find-dialog, but not possible to canel mid-file. Find in files is otherwise working as before.\n. For example when a allocation is failed on the following lines occur, a bad_alloc is thrown, due to heap allocation failed.\n_pOldFoundInfos->insert(_pOldFoundInfos->begin(), _pMainFoundInfos->begin(), _pMainFoundInfos->end());\n        _pOldMarkings->insert(_pOldMarkings->begin(), _pMainMarkings->begin(), _pMainMarkings->end());\nBefore:\nSearch result is not displayed.\nAfter\n\n.

If anything, working on making the tool cross platform will help bring to surface a variety of problems and thus solutions to those problems making de-bugging much faster (3 times faster to be exact). It is not too early. It is just the right time. If we wait, NPP will become more and more complex which will make it harder to make it cross platform.\nThe big question is can we generate enough interest (I think we can) to bring dedicated people to start the process while at the same time having a team to maintain the current version and deploy updates.\n. @ariccio there are 3 major platforms, windows, Linux and Mac OS. There would be three teams working on the project each team dedicated to one platform. Three people would be working on the same sets of problems through out and would effectively debug code nuances three times faster and three times more accurately. That's where the number 3 comes from.\n. @ariccio debugging speed is the reciprocal of the number of teams involved which is derived from the number of platforms involved.

If you are interested in developing npp for those, feel free to contribute to those.\nIt seems like you are interested in having an academic discussion for the sake of it rather than actually offering any real solutions.

One general note: I already have some improvements for the tab bar in line with #1075. It would be great if we could achieve those PRs to be compatible. Since @donho seems to be a little busy these days and does not merge PRs: Do you think it makes sense if you applied your changes on top of mine?\nSince my PR mainly deals with positioning of elements you should be fine with just additionally changing the parts were the icons are drawn.\nRegarding style:\n- I see that you use the large (aka not \"reduced\") style of the tab bar. I'd increase the size of icons for this style (similar to the red diskette icon in your screenshot). On the other hand: Have you verified that your changes also work well with the reduced tab bar size (which I assume is what most people are using)?\n- The feature should probably be optional. While it's definitely a cool feature, I personally like the current icons because they show me the state of files (saved, unsaved, write-protected, which is quite important to me) rather than the type of files (which is not that important to me).\nP.S. Also note that there's a bug when switching between reduced and non-reduced tab-bar styles. While switching the applied style is different to the style that is used after a restart of Notepad++. I intended to look into this issue as soon as #1075 was accepted, but it's probably relevant to your work, too.\n. Great! Let's hope it can be merged finally. :+1: \n.

Anybody has an idea what's going wrong?\n. Well, regarding the original issue f2cd7790669ec3867977293f5c83bdec235b81b5 would probably be sufficient. With the delayed message handling I can close Notepad++ (even if files have changed) without being asked whether I want to reload those files. Notepad++ simply closes (which is the desired behavior).\nThe emerging problem is the regressions caused by f2cd7790669ec3867977293f5c83bdec235b81b5 that causes the mouse cursor to start flickering.\n. @donho Yes exactly. The fix implemented in f2cd7790669ec3867977293f5c83bdec235b81b5 solved this issue as a side effect (it's basically doing the same as I initially suggested in comment 3).\nHowever it's causing the flickering issue which is why I never suggested to implement it.\n. It's not limited to the message dialog, it also happens in the rest of the Notepad++ GUI, for example on tabs.\nBy clicking certain UI elements / entering text one can stop the flickering (probably by straightening out whatever is wrong with the message queue at that point). I does not stop on its own!\nI hope you intend to fix it anyway?\n. No, flickering continues. How do you close the dialog? I usually choose \"Yes\" (i.e. reload the changed file)\n. No, I couldn't figure it out when I last worked on it, so I wrote down my findings in the hope somebody else would be able to pin down the cause.\nNow that we need the fix to prevent crashing it's obviously even more important to make it work.\n. Because I forgot to mention before:\nThis is tested on Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 10.\nThe tabbar behaves consistent on all three OSs\n. Tabbar height (or width respectively) was not my decision (see 7a25c9827ec884fe0f3cc98e5166d58491f9f3c0). Since it's not subject of this PR let's not digress further - what my patch achieves, though, is that tab height could be adjusted at any point in the future without breaking positioning of elements.\nRegarding 2px vertical position change of tabs without top bar highlighting: Read my description! It's intentional to be consistent with native Windows UI styling. While I'm not bound to this specific change, I think it's reasonable.\nAnyway let's wait for a response by @donho and/or @milipili first. I assume they have their own preferences and it does not make sense to fine-tune this PR as long as I don't even know if it will be accepted.\n. I'm currently working on tabbar, so I might have a look at the issue. However I'd prefer to have feedback on #1075 by project members before putting any work into this.\n. I'm currently working on tabbar, so I can have a look at the issue with tabs. However I'd prefer to have feedback on #1075 by project members before putting any work in this.\n. Find/Replace supports regular expressions which can do exactly what you want (plus much more).\n. Yes it's always reproducible for me with the following steps:\n- Open a file\n- Open the Find in Files dialog\n- Execute a search \"In all sub-folders\"\n- While the search is running grab the progress bar dialog with the mouse (and hold it!)\n- When the search finishes instead of showing results Notepad++ becomes unresponsive\nIt is important to hold the dialog during the time the search operation finishes. If one lets go of the dialog before the search operation finishes the problem does not occur,\n. OK, I think I know the culprit: The plugin \"XML Tools\". Let me verify by disabling...\n. Indeed, at one point in the past (when there wasn't auto-completion for XML-tags available in Notepad++ natively yet) I had enabled the option \"Tag auto-close in \"XML tools\". This messed up the test results for XML files.\nTherefore the only open question is if we want to auto-close tags also for non-XML/HTML files (the \"Text documents\" example with \"html/xml close tag\" enabled in the initial comment).\nApart from that question this issue is resolved.\n. Yes, I assumed so, but it could be useful for any document to autoclose HTML tags e.g. for writing Markdown (GitHub actually supports bolding text wit <b> tags as an example)\nOn the other hand it's surely not necessary, I just think that if we auto-complete all the other stuff in all document types we should probably not \"arbitrarily\" exclude HTML/XML tags.\nIt would be more consistent and therefore would better match user expectations.\n. Reproduced in Notepad++ 6.8.8 on Windows 7.\nSeems pretty serious given the fact that this could potentially damage data in unexpected ways!\n```\nNotepad++ v6.8.8\nBuild time : Dec 10 2015 - 01:11:37\nPath : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : OFF\nOS : Windows 7\nPlugins : none\n```\n. Still reproduced in Notepad++ v6.9.1 on Windows 7 (x64).\nMake sure to replace in \"Normal\" or \"Extended\" modes.\nThe issue is not present in \"Regular expression\" mode.\n. Please note that while @jsleroy might not actively contribute code to the compare plugin anymore he's very much \"alive\" and has recently merged @ufo's changes into his GitHub repository of the Compare plugin located at jsleroy/compare-plugin.\nAlso he expressed his interest at joining efforts and centralize all development at this (official) repository when I asked him about the future of the Compare plugin (see jsleroy/compare-plugin#2). There's also some more input on what could be done for the Compare plugin in the future (we didn't proceed any further yet because ufo never answered, but the idea is not yet shelved)\nSo in any case I'd suggest you to submit a merge request with your changes, so they won't be lost.\nAlso in the near future a current version of the plugin (preferably built from the official source) should be made available via plugin manager since it currently ships an outdated and buggy version.\nMaybe we could even get @pnedev to finish the work on the progress bar which would be a very welcome improvement for large files.\n. @Yaron10 I Don't consider myself very experienced either, so I can't really comment on code quality, but I'd certainly be happy to help with testing and some of the points listed in the issue I linked as necessary and as time permits!\n. Merging #1525 would be even better since it makes separate updates unnecessary in future.\n. Popular topic. :wink: \nPlease merge!\n. Actually #1525 would be even better.\n. Sounds a lot like what I discussed with @donho at f2cd7790669ec3867977293f5c83bdec235b81b5 and #1018.\nCould you check if this is the case?\n. It can be worked around by clicking once into the text area... maybe an indication what has to be done to fix the issue?. Automatic reload in fact would not be influenced from any of the workarounds proposed in the PRs nor is it influenced by the code already present. Both are only executed if a confirmation window is shown.\nIf you find a way to reproduce that would be very helpful, otherwise it's basically impossible to debug. If you can reproduce it on your machine and clicking into the text area help the same workaround could be applied of course.. Ah, one idea:\nCould it be, that you had modified the file inside Notepad++ before it was modified on disk?\nIn that very specific case you should see a confirmation message, too, and then it would trigger the very same issue @SinghRajenM and I are seeing!. I'd still love to know the cause of this issue...\nI'm afraid I wasn't able to figure it out yet, though. \ud83d\ude1e . I can confirm this. Also happens when not alt-tabbing back but using the mouse instead.\nYou should probably open a new issue for that. It's a case that is not handled by the workarounds that were applied and this issue certainly warrants further investigation.. You should probably check what messages are sent as a result of clicking the text area.\nI guess sending one single message could already be enough to sort this out (or maybe only changing order of messages somewhere, as I assume this is everything the conflicting commit did). I just created #2956 which contains and improves upon this fix.\nI assume you won't mind if Don commited that one instead @SinghRajenM ?. @donho Have you seen my comment? Should I rebase #2956?. Rebase done.\n@donho Those two issues are really the same and are caused by a confirmation dialog being shown.\nBefore this was handled by setting didDialog to true and then doing some workarounds afterwards, see here. It's the same code SinghRajenM's and my PR are using with the difference of an additional WM_LBUTTONDOWN (before only the WM_LBUTTONUP message was sent). With my PR those things are always done immediately before showing the dialog by calling the prepareBufferChangedDialog() function.. You should have a macro (\"Trim Trailing and Save\") which by default has the shortcut Shift+Alt+s. I'm afraid I don't like it:\n it unnecessarily blows up the size of the text boxes\n it's bad for the overall visual appearance of the dialog\n* most importantly: it allows for a lot less characters to be visible when I'm already often using more than the full size of the input which reduces efficiency a lot\nThe only reason where a mono-spaced font would be useful is when opening the dropdown, but this is a very minor improvement an in my opinion it does not outweigh the downsides by far.\nA useful change would the better visibility of upper case \"i\" vs lower case \"l\" but for that there are much better options (e.g. usage of Source Sans Pro or similar). Why should a margin be needed at all? Just wastes space as far as I can see.... Is this only used for \"Search\" and \"Replace\" (\"Highlight\"?) tabs?\nOr is \"Search in Files\" also updated?\nI'm asking because there is already a progress bar for find in files and some consistency might be desirable.. I really like the idea as I'm often struggling with navigating in recent search results!\nHowever there are some things I don't like:\n* The options in the search dialog are hard to understand (it took me quite some time to figure it out even with the explanations) and probably not useful enough for most people. I suggest to have the \"Only one finder\" option in the preferences dialog and drop the other options in favor of reasonable defaults that should work for almost everybody:\n  * Same name merge: Never merge searches unless they're identical (in that case update the last results)\n  * Close empty: Do not even create a \"finder\" if there are no results - problem solved (maybe show a message box or print a message to the status bar of the find dialog in this case to inform the user)\n  * Show line once (potentially worth a second PR): Improve the finder to support multiple search results per line. Ideally allow the user to jump to the correct occurence by clicking it (i.e. track where the user clicks). Working around this by dropping results feels wrong.\nGeneral note regarding wording (\u201cClose all finders\u201d, \"Close this finder\", \"Find in this finder):\nFinder is redundant here and introduces a concept unknown to the user (what's a\"finder\"?). It would be much clearer to simply use \"Close all\", \"Close\" and \"Find in results\". From the context the meaning should be obvious.\nAdditional feature request that might fit here:\nI'm often missing context menu entries allowing to \"Re-use search parameters\" or \"Update this search\" since I find myself often doing the same search twice (e.g. after switching git branches or similar). * In practice I've never seen msi installs to be fast but whatever...\n What MSI installer are you talking about by the way? Is there a link? Is there source code?\n  For the Inkscape project I'm currently maintaining .exe (NSIS) and .msi (WiX) installers and the .msi installer is giving me a hard time over and over again. It's inferior in almost every respect (not because I would not want to make it better but simply because the *.msi format seems to be a pain in the a**) so I prefer the NSIS installer very much (even if it's ancient software).If you're knowledgeable about .msi/WiX - how do I at least get the MSI installer to uninstall old files (not present anymore in the new package) and properly update other files? I hope there's a possibility that does not require giving all files a version number... Otherwise I'm pretty sure I will never accept msi as a reasonable format for anything more than administrative deployment.... @yamlfd: Not really I'm afraid....\nThe specific issue is explained in a bit more detail in https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/1653574 but I did not find the time for closer investigation yet. If you want to help out contributions are welcome.... Either I'm constantly reading over it or we have different ideas on how this should work...\nI don't want to uninstall the whole folder (a user might have copied files there after installation), I want to uninstall everything the last MSI installer installed (if it's not updated) and I want to get rid of all old  uninstallation entries and program shortcuts.\nAt the very least the latter parts seems to fail (I have not yet confirmed the former part)..

    "glennfromiowa": "Note that this can be manually accomplished with current functionality using the Shortcut Mapper. Is this enhancement to map the \"Show All Characters\" to Ctrl + Shift + 8 by default? If so, would this apply to upgraded and new versions of Notepad++, or would it only be applied to new installations?\nMy preference would be to map \"Show White Space and Tab\" to Ctrl + Shift + 8; \"Show End of Line\" to Alt + Shift + 8; then \"Show All Characters\" could be mapped to the intersection of those at Ctrl + Alt + Shift+ 8. Or perhaps just the first one to correlate to the Visual Studio shortcut. I'm not sure why the preference for an MS Word setting over a Visual Studio setting that programmers would use.. This issue has come up again, and although it's old, just wanted to bring up a couple of points:\n1. Commit 5e24014 does appear to address saving settings in an alternate location. That's awesome; I didn't know about that before.\n2. However, it doesn't address backing up the settings, and only locates certain settings in the cloud.\n    a. In addition, it doesn't address backing up plugins, themes, etc. or any settings used for them.\nAs I understand it, there are 3 places config files can be:\n1. In the user's AppData folder\n2. In the install folder for Notepad++\n3. In the folder specified by the cloud\\choice file\nAlthough it's possible to determine which location is being pulled from, especially using the Debug Info in Notepad++, there are enough questions on the forums about settings not being saved (like  this post, or this one ) to indicate that's confusing to many users. And although it is possible to just copy the files from the appropriate location to make a backup, since many users are confused about which location Notepad++ is using, I think it would be an excellent idea to have an Export Settings option available, since Notepad++ already knows where it's pulling the settings files from. It should not only copy the 10\u2020 files mentioned in Configuration Files, but also the folders plugins, themes, and possibly localization, which may be in a different location than the main configuration files. \n\u2020 session.xml appears to not be saved in the cloud location, which probably is appropriate - it should remain saved locally, but, oh, I would be lost if it forgot which files I was editing!!! However, there is already a Save Session option available for that purpose.\nI think @dail8859 had the best idea:\n\nIt might work better if the settings were exported to a zip of all the XML files, since it really wasn't designed to glob all the XML settings in a single file.\n\nIt wouldn't need to be in a zip file necessarily, although that would give the functionality requested.  I'm planning to open a new issue on this, unless I hear back that it would be better to re-open this one?\nEdited to include examples of forum posts.. Request #2867 is newer, but is related to this request, and addresses losing the focus of the tab when this happens also.. Regarding\n\n...keep focus on current file\n\nit should be noted that after the Steps to Reproduce the Issue, the focus is retained on the last file that you have clicked Yes or No on. Based on other wording, I believe the Expected Behavior is that the focus should be retained on the file that had the focus before the prompt(s) appeared, regardless of whether there is a Reload All or Reload None button. I'd like to propose an alternate, but related scenario:\nDescription of the Issue\nWhen files have changed since Notepad++ last had the focus (whether due to checking out a git folder, changed log files, or other reason), upon regaining focus, Notepad++ displays a confirmation dialog for each file, asking if it should be reloaded, and then the MDI focus is changed to the last document confirmed. This behavior is time-consuming and has risk due to the fact that the position of the dialog box sometimes moves between file confirmations, making it likely to click a button you didn't intend to if confirming many files. Options to Reload All or Reload None could reduce that risk. Also, especially with multiple files being changed externally, the logical, expected behavior would be that the last file loaded (or the file previously having the focus, if no new file opened) would now have the focus. Note that a confirmation dialog also appears when loaded files have been deleted externally. In this case, however, the focus is only retained on the confirmed file if Yes is selected (to retain non-existent file).\nSteps to Reproduce the Issue\n\nOpen 2-n files in Notepad++\nMake or allow changes in 2-n files externally, whether through Git, allowing log files to update, etc.\nOpen 1-n files associated with Notepad++, for example, using the OS shell or utility with similar function.\nClick on each confirmation dialog that pops up, confirming whether to reload each file or not.\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nHave buttons available to Reload All or Reload None of the files, in addition to the Yes and No buttons.\nRestore the focus to the last file loaded from an external source, or to the file that had the focus before confirming the file reload(s).\n\nActual Behavior\n\nEach file must be confirmed individually, with care being taken to click on the intended button.\nThe focus is on the last to be confirmed, and you have to scan the tabs to find the file(s) that were opened.\n\n.

    "alexhass": "I'm wondering that there are regression releases and nothing happens to this regression here, too.. How can we reach out to the maintainer?. Sure, but where?\n. I'm wondering that npp maintainers are not aware who provides the plugins they distribute\n. Looks like a new release has been published. This means the xml tools plugin is maintained. But how to contact him?\n. Fault\n. Using CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE sounds like a serious security issue. There are good reasons to use revocation lists.. The question is only why your DPI blocks revocation lists. This is no correct behaviour. \nRevocation lists are used more and more for serious reasons. You may remember why the ssl business of startcom and symantec and others will be terminated soon.... Full fledged MSI installer is here on my site https://www.hass.de/content/notepad-msi-package-enterprise-deployment-available. I shared the source code with Don 2.5 years ago. Still no movement. Shit NSIS need to die.\nDon wrote me something about MSI to EXE wrapper, but this is NOT a full fledged MSI and diallows customizations at all. We need to avoid such a shit.\n. Refactored all my MSI build scripts. v7.0.0 is also available now under https://www.hass.de/content/notepad-msi-package-enterprise-deployment-available\n. I shared several previous versions with the maintainer, but he has not taken over the job. I wish we would stop with nsis shit.\nThe msi's can be downloaded from www.hass.de. Don does not answer. It\u2018s like a black hole. No idea why we cannot get it forward.. I will share it when it will be added to the project, but it looks like Don like dead horses like nsis more and do not understand that a msi wrapper is wrong direction. It is more the other way around... build an exe with an embedded msi if an exe is required.\nI do not know why you need to work on my msi code. Your help is currently not needed from my point of view. If you have any special needs you can share your ideas and I may add this on payed basis.. I shared my code first time long before the github repository existed. No need to deningate Don, he made it on it\u2018s own. Only review the queue here or send him an email. No answers, no solutions, no progress, no way to commit code to move the project forward.\nMy main main reason is frustration. After nearly 3 years of frustration on this project I\u2018m not very motivated - without changes to how issues are handled. I have bugs opened 2 years ago where stupid notepad request UAC on a plugin install to appdata onna network drive. Zero feedback and none of my users can install plugins since this day. I cannot solve myself as I do not develop notepad. Open source or not, this issue queue here is waste of time. Nobody has a focus on resolving the issues. It just grow and grow.\nI do not sell the code. When I started I hoped to help the project and get the work away from my personal desk. I still have to build the setup as I need to deploy it. It looks like Don has no idea about software deployment. Otherwise he would rip nsis. So - change something, fix the serious bugs and move the project forward and people may become motivated again.. This is not an msi.. Yes I do.\nGruss\nAlex\n\nAm 26.03.2018 um 09:10 schrieb JeromeFa notifications@github.com:\nHi Alex,\nWill you still maintain your msi notepad++ solution or will you stop ?\nThanks\nJerome\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/1102/38/code-signing-certificates---sha-1-and-sha-256-information\nThis restriction will not apply to the time-stamp certificate used to time-stamp the code-signing certificate or the certificate\u2019s signature hash (thumbprint) until January 1, 2017. After this time, Windows will treat any code with a SHA-1 time-stamp or SHA-1 signature hash (thumbprint) as if the code did not have a time-stamp signature.\"\n\nSo all software should be signed with SHA256 only. SHA1 signatures are no longer needed as Windows 7 has full support for SHA256 and SHA1 is only required for WinXP/Vista and both are no longer supported.. Currently signing sha1 is faded out. Soon no CA will sign sha1... supporting xp is really a joke today. No browser supports it for about 1 year, too.\nStill all no reason not signing with sha256.. On x86 installer you need both or you cannot use the shell extension under a x64 system. However the file should not have the same file name. I cannot extract the DLL automactically to build the MSI for all people. The DLL only exists inside the EXE installers and not in the binary ZIP. In the MSI setup on hass.de I have renamed then and named them properly to it is clear that has been installed. NppShell64.dll or NppShell.dll for x86.\nMuch better would be to drop the shit NSI and migrate to MSI.\n. To repro the issue run this and you see a duplicate file issue.\n\"%ProgramFiles%\\7-Zip\\7z\" x npp.%version%.Installer.exe -o\"%workdir%\" \"NppShell_06.dll\" \"updater\\*\"\n. Found a workaround to automate it.\nx86\n\"%ProgramFiles%\\7-Zip\\7z\" x npp.%version%.Installer.exe -o\"%workdir%\" \"NppShell_06.dll\" \"updater\\*\" -aou\ncopy \"%workdir%\\NppShell_06.dll\" \"%version%\\%arch%\\NppShell64.dll\"\ncopy \"%workdir%\\NppShell_06_1.dll\" \"%version%\\%arch%\\NppShell.dll\"\nx64\n\"%ProgramFiles%\\7-Zip\\7z\" x npp.%version%.Installer.%arch%.exe -o\"%workdir%\" \"NppShell_06.dll\" \"updater\\*\" -aos\ncopy \"%workdir%\\NppShell_06.dll\" \"%version%\\%arch%\\NppShell64.dll\"\nx64\nHowever, this still suxxx and is not reliable without unique file names.\n. Better error messages are wuite useless. I might run both versions on different computers. There should be no message at all.\n. Yep... some days thinking how stupid error messages for users are. They cannot solve it and do not understsnd it. I expect 100% complains.\nBoth versions should be able to run in parallel with roaming profiles.\n. Any chances to get this SERIOUS bug fixed asap???\n. BUMP. This is not correct! You need to enable per User plugins. Than the files are safed in APPDATA of the user. Than they conflict.. The developer of the software is aware of this feature.\nJust move the dlls in a x86/x64 subfolder and all is good. Should be quite simple. Moving to disable is already implemented... so it could be just a few lines of code if you know where.\nI'm not running both, but it is possible that larger environments have this. I'd like to switch all our users to x64. From the dll files and with a batch it is not easy to detect what arch they are. This need to be done in the software.. I'm the maintainer of Notepad++ MSI setup, see https://www.hass.de/content/notepad-msi-package-enterprise-deployment-available.\nThe feature you may have not heard about is placing \"allowAppDataPlugins.xml\" into the root of \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\". This make notepad saving all user plugins to the users \"%APPDATA%\\Notepad++\\plugins\" folder that is a redirected folder on several file servers around the world.\nAll notepad++ need to do is saving them into \"%APPDATA%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\x86\" or \"%APPDATA%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\x64\" or we need to rename the files to take the architecture into consideration.\nThe setup cannot solve this problem as the setup runs as SYSTEM and NOT in the context of our 500 notepad++ users. The nobrainer part of the NSIS setup that installs something per user is never executed as these folders are not available when setup runs. Users have no permission to install software. I think that notepad++ moves unstable addons to disabled when they crashed, isn't it? It is really years ago when I have experienced this... so not sure.\nI cannot run your migration scenarios... this need to be done by the software itself. I cannot run a batch for every user and I do not like to delete the plugin from everyones homes drive. In days where the maintainer removed the plugin manager just because of a stupid banner, this makes it impossible for users to re-install their needed plugins. This is a large enterprise installation... not a home user install.\nNothing against your funny workaround ideas, but they are not working in large scale.. > If you simple do as you suggest and change where Notepad++ searches for plugins, you have now caused problems for alot of users that had existing installations. Since Notepad++ had originally stored them in %APPDATA%\\Notepad++\\plugins directory, then the user would find their updated installation doesn't have any plugins installed (since the new Notepad++ would be looking in a x86 or x64 sub directory). This change would also in turn kill off the existing Plugin Manager as it now would not store the plugins in the appropriate locations. (Yes the Plugin Manager could be updated but would cause alot of confusion for users.)\nMaybe you read the previous comments first before commenting? I said notepad need to move the current plugins to these subfolders on first startup. If you can share a different approach (than x86/x64 subfolder) how to solve the problem and allow the installation of both architectures let us know, please.\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.5-released.html is not the issue that implements the new plugin manager. Can you share the issue number on github, please?. > Not in general, but at least in your and/or your customers usecase.\nI never said this is the case for everyone. I only say this is something the software NEED to expect.\n\nNo, the Notepad++ NSIS setup moves the plugins known to be unstable.\n\nOk so far. Then we just need a few more lines of code to move the files around. Are you really sure? I think if notepad crashes it will disable the addon... also after setup... for repro we would need a crashing plugin...\n\nThey were not intended to be funny. I was just trying to help (based on the info provided), but glad you liked them.\n\nWell there may be some bad workarounds. I could also waste my time, scan all folders for used plugins, download the x64 files manually and replace them on the upgrade days.\nBut I do not know when people will reboot their computers (and WakeOnLan is not always possible). Than I have no clue when I can replace the plugin files and so on and so on. This must simply fail and still does not allow the use of both x86/x64 versions in parallel. Maybe someone needs a plugin that is only availble in x86, but it is critical for this work. So I cannot migrate the user, but software is always installed per machine. There are only tons of new issues poping up that just need to be handled already by the software.. Without an issue on github, how is this coordinated? Every commit should have it's own case.. We now have October 2018 and x64 Notepad++ still complains about x86 per user plugins. When can we change the folder so this does not conflict?. NSIS is biggest sh** ever and should RIP like InnoSetup. Both cannot deployed via Active directory. That is why i'm talking for several years with Don to take my MSI over and discontinue NSIS.\nBut this is not the point here. Changing a file (by adding a signature) without increasing the version is always wrong and bad practice. More bad practice is signing files from other sources.\nThe idea behind the MSI feature are faster running update setups. No file that has the correct version need to be replaced if the most important flag is already the same (file version). This improves setup speed in an extreme way.\nThere seems no way to stop this behavior. A file version need to be increased if the file is changed. This is best practice.. See https://www.hass.de/content/notepad-msi-package-enterprise-deployment-available\nI have shared the source code of MSI installer for Notepad++ with Don. The version he has it outdated now, but if he is willingly I'm sharing it with him.\n\nIf you're knowledgeable about .msi/WiX - how do I at least get the MSI installer to uninstall old files (not present anymore in the new package) and properly update other files?\n\nEvery of my installers has this feature embedded. It is very easy. WiX has a util feature named RemoveFolderEx that does all the cleanup magic. Please see my documenation at https://www.hass.de/content/wix-how-use-removefolderex-your-xml-scripts.\nI'm not sure what you mean with update other files. Every file that has a higher version number will be updated. If there is no version e.g. text files a hash compare will be done. Nothing need to be done by hand. Just create a new GUID with * for every release. If guids are static and only changed if the file really changed - you will see the extreme performance benefit... The * for GUID will cause the setup to run slower as every file need to be checked/updated again.\nAside - I offered the Inkscape team my help to create this installer (~3 years ago?) and than a very few months later I have seen it was already done. Thanks for this - it saved me a lot of time! Until today the AD deployment worked like a charm.. @Ede123: Has this article helped you? I just extended and updated it a bit.. That is exactly what I have documented. Just copy and paste and delete the uninstall registry key of nsis. I have no account on the site, sorry.. @Ede123 \n\nEither I'm constantly reading over it or we have different ideas on how this should work...\nI don't want to uninstall the whole folder (a user might have copied files there after installation),\n\nMaybe. I think I maintain the installer and nobody is allowed to alter the main installation. Therefore it is save to remove/cleanup files no longer needed. RemoveEx does not uninstall the whole folder, it only uninstalls the differences so that no garbage or conflicting directories are left behind. I wonder how you are able to support customized program folders and this has never caused strange situations to happen. I guess you talk about plugins/addons that are manually copied into incscape. I also done this on my box, but this is clearly a design issue of incscape. I suggest to move this outside the main program folder as this prevent clean updates. One solution are the per user plugins in appdata like we have in notepad. Another solution could be an installation of custom addon stuff to ProgramData folder to make it per machine.\n\nI want to uninstall everything the last MSI installer installed (if it's not updated) and I want to get rid of all old uninstallation entries and program shortcuts.\n\nI'm using RemoveEx for so long now... I think what you want is the default behaviour, or what happens here?. I cannot see the code change in https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/installer/nsisInclude/autoCompletion.nsh. This is not in master... so it is not in the project.. Is https://github.com/MAPJe71/NPP-Plugin-PluginManager_Fork this the place where the new plugin manager it will be developed? So I can file issues?. Found the older version in XML plugin.. Why should users not able to remove auto-updater? \nI need to remove it to disallow users to update if MSI installer is used. Than the administrator is in charge of updating the software. The user also has no permission and no idea what version is compatible with company applications. So I seriously need to be able to remove updater.. > File extension can't be associated from \"Settings->Preferences->File Association\" if user does not have administrative rights. Moreover, writing HKCR is not recommended way to associate file extensions. As per MSDN, HKCR is merged view of HKCU and HKLM and it is primarily intended for compatibility with the registry in 16-bit Windows. So instead of writing to HKCR, write to HKCU which does not require admin access.\nInterresting. VSCode setup does it wrong, too and changes HKCR. Have you fully tested this change?. ",

For instance, this SO question asks specifically for alt-tab to switch between programs, not between a program and another program find dialog.\n. Good point about usable design. The SO question got me wondering if that was the best design approach. Interesting enough, I tried the same steps with other programs to see how alt-tab was handled. Excel's find dialog becomes another window so tabbing to it is no issue. Other programs (Word, IE) have inline find dialogs, but alt-tab does not preserve the find dialog focus. They seem to do the opposite of what you're requesting. Chrome preserves the find dialog focus, however.\n. I was able to replicated this issue (v6.7.8.2).

There's no ANSI version of this routine. Therefore, the data buffer is also Unicode. The string is not NULL-terminated, so you can't just use wcscpy. If you are using the ATL or MFC CString class, you can instantiate a wide CString from a raw string with a given number of characters\n\nSo, quite possibly the only reason for usage of ATL in this class is for the CString class, which easies working with widechar unicode strings a bit. So probably it's relatively easy to make it work without this dependency. I should try it tomorrow... Really not sure if I'll manage to do anything.\nBy the way, how this File browser feature works?

No dspellcheck plugin, no freeze.\nI found the notepad++ spellcheck feature to be super-useful (and bizarrely so, since I use it as a source code editor most of the time), so it would be great if this functionality gets restored, soon.\nThanks again for your efforts.\n. @Predelnik Thanks for the advice and the link. I obtained the latest release and the problem has gone away. It was pretty easy to repro and completely consistent, before, so I'd say this was a winner.\n. ",
    "JVimes": "Once the Plugin Manager is serving the fixed version, it would be good to make the installer warning more helpful, \"... Please install the latest version of the Plugin from the Plugin Manager\". \nI haven't hit the bug, myself, and was confused that installing the disabled Plugin worked fine for me.\n. It's working on my machines. I'm curious what's happening for others. I installed Notepad++ (via Chocolatey), then installed DSpellCheck via plugin manager. I had to go into the plugin settings and \"download dictionaries\" or no spell checking. No errors/warnings and the plugin works fine. Would be nice if it came working with Notepad++.\n. Glad to help :) Ya, the plugin really needs to come with some dictionaries or it seems broken. I wasn't sure if that was happening for everyone, or I was doing something weird.\n. ",

    "taras-au": "As another N++ plugin developer I do know the pain of not being able to deliver the fix to your users for months. The fact that the plugin manager DB has been updated is irrelevant as it's only pushed to the users every few months or so. Thus it could take only 10 mins to make the fix but i's delivery will depend completely on the Plugin Manager team schedule.\nI was able to solve the problem completely by providing an alternative channel for updated. The plugin does the checking for updates every day (configurable) and the about box allows user to check and install the updates at any time:\n\nYou can (if you wish) use the same solution. The plugin code is on CodePLex. Help yourself out.:) \nBTW, great job with your plugin!\n. As it is stated in this thread the problem is solved in v1.2.14.2.\nBut you need to download and install the binaries manually from here: https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/releases/tag/1.2.14.2\nIt's really the PluginManager who is 'preventing' the fix from hitting the user's desktops.\n. > Considering that this issue was first disclosed almost six months ago, I would think that the involved parties have had more than enough time to resolve this; what's still holding this up?\nBeing plugin developer by myself I can put my 5 cents here. \nIt's very unlikely it's due to the DSpellCheck author lack of trying. I know that he fixed the problem (which wasn't even his) very quickly and for months and months PluginManager was still pushing the older incompatible binaries. And now it looks like DSpellCheck is smeared as \"unstable\" forever. Actually there is no mechanism for reviewing/reverting this verdict. It's completely up to PluginManager team to clear previously discriminated individual plugins.\n. Just trying to defuse the conversation :)\n\nNo, it's all up to @donho to include updated and fixed version in installer\n\nBut right now N++ is distributed with the FIXED version of the plugin. It's just marked in the PluginManager as unstable. It is really a single matter of establishing the process of Markin/Unmarking plugins as unstable in the Plugin manager. May be it should be done per plugin version.\n. If you are saying that in this case keeping a stable plugin marked as unstable is just as a single miss then I have no problems accepting that. After all I see no evidence that it happens all the time. Thus I see no issue here.  \nThough I do find it inconvenient (at least) that delivering the fix could take up to 3-4 month after the fix is made public. And the plugin developer has no control over it. \nDon't get me wrong I perfectly understand  why the plugin manager config file is not updated more frequently. I am just stating that the current model pops some questions about the developer experiences. \nIn my case I recognized this problem earlier and implemented plugin's own internal update channel. I just had no other choice as my plugin could not afford \"slow releases\" model. But I don't really see any good GENERIC solution (or work around) that the all pluging developers would benefit from.\nHave a nice day.\n. Thank you Dave for such a detailed explanation. \n\nThe author is free to set it back after fixing the issue(s).\n\nThis actually completely changes everything. I missed this one. My bad. It means that in fact there is a simple mechanism for clearing the plugins that were previously marked as unstable.\nWith the new system in place will there be any changes for the submitting the updates. Currently I am using http://www.brotherstone.co.uk/npp/pm/admin web interface for this.Is it going to stay the same?\n. ",
    "TBugReporter": "It seems the code to disable DSpellCheck also does not discriminate regarding DSpellCheck versions, let alone discriminating Windows versions (for example, this machine I'm on now still runs W7, and therefore has no reason to have DSpellCheck disabled).  I installed 1.2.14.2 a while ago on all our machines; in the intervening time, I've also downloaded and installed several updated versions of Notepad++.  Each time, DSpellCheck was unceremoniously (and indiscriminatingly) disabled, and frankly, I'm getting sick of it.  Considering that this issue was first disclosed almost six months ago, I would think that the involved parties have had more than enough time to resolve this; what's still holding this up?\n. @xylographe:\n\nJust rename plugins\\DSpellCheck.dll, for example to DSpellCheckOK.dll, and it won't be disabled.\n\nYes, this is a simple workaround, but one of my points was that after six months, it seems ridiculous that users still need to work around an issue that's no longer an issue - except for cleaning up after the previous half-baked workarounds.\n. I just upgraded to Notepad++ 6.8.8 yesterday, and for the first time in several months, I haven't had to deal with the installer disabling DSpellCheck.  I don't know who's responsible for this change, but to whoever it is:  Thank you!\n. I did these things the other times (or rather, I thought I did), plus I scanned the registry for leftovers (which is very difficult to do for a program named Notepad++; even searches for \"npp\" came up with hundreds of false positives), however, I chose to play along and went thru the routine again, and this time there were no problems.  Now I just have to reconstruct my many configuration tweaks - and hope that none of them puts me back where I was.\n. ",
    "vgturtle127": "@donho This is still disabled in the latest 6.9 release, I thought you disabled the removal of DSpellcheck?\n@bruderstein I will help contribute in any way I can if you will just tell me what to do and link to your repository and stuff. :smile: \n. Oh, and also you could add a menu option to switch between the two, that way you easily update comments that way.\nThe reason I brought this up is because I am currently going through a project with over 100,000 lines of code and changing all the comments from block comments to line comments. It is boring and monotonous, but it will make the project better in the long run I suppose.\n. @mbilloo This was years ago, but I basically wanted to condense all of the comment options from \"add this\" and \"remove this\" to \"toggle\". This eliminates an option, frees up a hotkey, and cleans up the user interface.\nNotepad++ now has both of those options and a toggle for single line comments, and both options for block comments. I suggest removing all of the options and just using the \"toggle\" function, because it does the same thing but is more UI/UX friendly and makes more sense than having 2 or 3 options for one action.\nThe options also need to ensure that selected lines change to whatever the opposite of what they use to be was, if you know what I mean?\nAnyway, that's what I think should happen now.\n@milipili @donho . @milipili @donho Has any research or work be done for this?\n. @milipili @donho This won't be merged unless it uses the default browser and search engine, right?\n. It should also say \"Update stopped\" instead of all that text. It is a bit redundant.\nWe can assume it is the user because only the user can stop an update. If it was an error or something, it wouldn't be the user anyway.\n. Actually, no. I tried that, but it kept replacing it in places I told it not to, and didn't even find some in other places.\nRegEx is kind of buggy with special characters. Especially when you have files larger than 20MB or so, or with more than 5000 lines or so.\nAlthough, I suppose most text editors are like this. But Atom doesn't seem to mind larger files and more lines of code. But it replaces the crashing with extremely long load times.\n. Yeah, my problem with adding tons of functionality to Notepad++ with plugins is that many of them haven't been updated since we switched to GitHub, if not for a very long time.\nAlso, some plugins still come in multiple versions, or have newer versions elsewhere, or have older versions through the plugin manager but not anywhere else. All very confusing.\n. Good to hear! I wish the hex editor plugin worked better. I kind of like it better than most other hex editors that are dedicated. :disappointed: \n. @dail8859 Thank you!\n. Yeah, but the TextFX plugin isn't very stable. It keeps crashing Notepad++ on larger projects.\n. I suppose, but if the plugin doesn't get updated or if the plugin ever breaks then you would be kind of screwed.\n. @dail8859 Since this is a duplicate of #2821 should I close this?\n@ReflexivR TextFX isn't really maintained anymore, and I don't anticipate anybody getting it to work just for timestamp/date functions.\n@MAPJe71 I couldn't get it to work reliably, unfortunately.\n@Rikk I would like to move away from plugins since most are unmaintained and buggy, 32-bit or 64-bit.. @dail8859 Every time it would paste something, it would just paste an EOL character instead of whatever I wanted it to add.\nI was kind of going at the plugin wrong, I thought it was basically a plugin to write plugins in Lua, so I thought I was going to have to go about writing something from scratch. Oops.\nAlso, to clarify what I stated earlier about plugins being outdated or if they break, I meant a simple function like this should just be added to the main application instead of put into some plugin. I like the idea of plugins, but I hate having some huge plugin that I only use for like 2 or 3 things, you know? It just makes me feel like there is a better way.. @dail8859 And to be fair, I'm not super well-versed in the nuances of the Notepad++ codebase, so maybe I'm retarded. \ud83d\ude06 \nBut yeah, I didn't really think of all that. I suppose I was thinking of my early C++ learning in school where I wrote an application that gives you the date and time.. @donho @linquize Could we rebase this and merge it please? This would be helpful for many reasons.\n. @donho Very interesting. This will no doubt help with out of memory errors on larger files as well.\n. I would be OK with this, I think the default Notepad++ logo would be good, but in place of the chameleon, just put the file extension or language or whatever.\n. If it is full of bugs, then why would we mark it as good? Why don't we mark it as pretty broken, since most of the features are broken, and it crashes Notepad++ most of the time?\n. Oh, OK. I was like, what? :laughing: \nI think I have the source, but honestly Hex Workshop or HxD is a way better option.\nHowever, I may have a look at updating the source and fixing any bugs. I will see.\n. @mik2 Oh, no I meant a dedicated hex editor. As in, a seperate application as opposed to one built off of a text editor. If you Google the two hex editors I mentioned, they are both available for download.\n. @mik2 I understand what you're saying, but at least for me, the plugin crashes a lot and isn't very stable. Does it work OK for you?\n@xylographe Does Notepad++ use hardcoded plugin names or something?\n. @xylographe Huh, that seems like a somewhat inefficient way of doing things, maybe I will make another issue for that. :smiley: \nAs for the current issue, I think the hex editor plugin needs to be updated in order for it to be considered stable. I think a hex editor should be able to handle files larger than 4MB, which this doesn't seem to handle very well in my experience. Let me take a look at it and I will see if maybe a quick update can be done to make it more stable or something... :+1: \n. @Borkason Huh, it always crashes Notepad++ for me. I also wish I was asked first.. @mik2 \nI have switched to using a hex editor by itself, and Notepad++ for everything else. I strongly suggest everybody else do the same, as there are better hex editors out there.. @donho \nAlso, we should update TinyXML. :smile: \n. @vlakoff @donho JSON is only supported via a plugin currently, I thought?\n. @dail8859 Thanks. :wink: \nTime to remove JSON Viewer, then. :smile: \n. Switching to using more built-in Scintilla stuff will also make it more portable too! :smile: \n. @westor7 Would you close this if it is not necessary, please?\n. @westor7 Would you close this if it is not necessary, please?\n. @dogancelik @donho :+1: \n. @donho @DavidHaslam I think this is a beneficial change. I am also a user of Mozilla Thunderbird.\n:+1: \n. :+1: \n. @squarefractal Also having support for Travis CI and Coverity might be nice. Especially with a large code base.\n. @donho @milipili @squarefractal Yeah, probably best to do it how @milipili described.\n. @surjit NSIS is used for the installer. Why?\n. @surjit Would you close the issue, then?\n. @ClaudiaFrank Yeah, but it should still be added since those files are usually exclusive to Visual Basic.\n. @ClaudiaFrank I was actually just talking about .bas from experience. :laughing: \n. @Tragen I think changing everything to be relative to the executable sounds like a good idea for portability, at least on Windows. Reducing the dependence on the registry and external directories will make development and testing easier as well.\n. @ClaudiaFrank Yeah, and it runs fine without them. The problem is, if I remove all of my plugins and just keep the default plugins, it still does it. As a matter of fact, if I have any plugins at all it doesn't load the .nfo file and crashes... :fearful: \nDo you know what is happening to make this crash like this? I opened an issue because I assumed it was a problem with Notepad++, since it seemingly has some sort of an issue with any plugin instead of just one. :disappointed: \n. @Tmp341 Yeah, I tried it again and it seems the hex editor is causing the problem.\nWhat's weird is I tried it before and it seemed to work fine with the hex editor plugin, but I suppose the plugin just causes random plentiful issues at any given moment.\n@donho Is it still labeled as a good plugin? Is the author still around? I feel like it may need to be labled as an unstable plugin again. More so then DSpellCheck, since this causes catastrophic errors and crashes.\n. @Tmp341 I don't think the hex editor likes .nfo files, because you can literally just change the extension and it will crash. Files that have ASCII art in them (regardless of extension) also crash most of the time.\n. @wyrex Thanks for the link, I will check that out.\nI have pretty much switched to using a hex editor by itself, since using text editor plugins and stuff is super buggy and often performance suffers.\nI wish there was a decent hex editor for Windows, or even for Linux. None of them are very good. :disappointed: \n. @marcows Does vanilla Scintilla build fine with GCC/MinGW?\n. @marcows OK, I had never tried with MinGW, so I wasn't sure. Thanks.\n. @marcows Oh, I read that but I guess I misunderstood. Which extensions? Or is it extensions in general?\n. @marcows Oh, OK. I'm on a roll today. :laughing: \n. ",

Zero termination is probably not needed, but should be tested first.\nAlternatively you can try to change the approach how SCN_HOTSPOTDOUBLECLICK implementation currently works to something without SCI_SETWORDCHARS/SCI_SETCHARSDEFAULT.\n. @MAPJe71\nIt seems you have improved your function list parsers.

In RunDlg.cpp on line 195 do something like this:\n``` cpp\nHINSTANCE res = ::ShellExecute(hWnd, TEXT(\"open\"), cmd2Exec, args2Exec, TEXT(\".\"), SW_SHOW);\n// As per MSDN (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762153(v=vs.85).aspx) \n// If the function succeeds, it returns a value greater than 32.\n// If the function fails, it returns an error value that indicates the cause of the failure.  \nint retResult = reinterpret_cast(res);\nif (retResult <= 32)\n{\n    generic_string errorMsg;\n    errorMsg += TEXT(\"Open\\n------\\n\");\n    errorMsg += cmd2Exec;\n    errorMsg += TEXT(\" \");\n    errorMsg += args2Exec;\n    errorMsg += TEXT(\"\\n------\\nfailed : \");\nswitch (retResult)\n{\n    case NULL:\n        errorMsg += TEXT(\"NULL\");\n        break;\n    case ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND: // same as SE_ERR_FNF\n        errorMsg += TEXT(\"ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND\");\n        break;\n\n    // ... some more error codes ...\n\n    case SE_ERR_SHARE:\n        errorMsg += TEXT(\"SE_ERR_SHARE\");\n        break;\n    default:\n        errorMsg += TEXT(\"UNKNOWN ERROR\");\n        break;\n}\n\n::MessageBox(hWnd, errorMsg.c_str(), TEXT(\"ShellExecute - ERROR\"), MB_ICONERROR);\n\n}\nreturn res;\n```\nYou can open a new clean PR for this and close this one if you like.\n. For performance reason scintilla does not narrowing the scroll width automatically. You can use one of the scripting plugins to update SCI_SETSCROLLWIDTH on your own.\n. Run commands are fully customizable, you can change them, delete them or add new ones. In your case replace CURRENT_WORD with FULL_CURRENT_PATH and you'll get the functionality you have described.\n. I can not guaranty that this will be accepted, but it would be an improvement IMO. I'd prefer the second implementation, but it's finally up to you.\nSome more ideas:\n- Shifting Doc Switcher from preference dialog to 'View/Doc Switcher' and eventually in the toolbar.\n- Adding more columns to Doc Switcher, at least 'Date Modified' and making it optional like the extension column.\n. Try the newest version 6.9.2 and see if it happens again.\n. Currently I don't have access to my development machine, but customization is quite simple.\nInside ColourPopup dialog (first popup dialog when changing colors):\n- Right click on a color you want to change\n- Choose a new color\nThat's all.\n. Probably you would like to change this too.\n. ...and this.\n. ",

    "cganchev": "I can't believe that this issue is still not fixed.\nNotepad2 is also based on Scintilla and handles auto-indent correctly.\nThe issue in Notepad++ happens when you are at the beginning of the line and you press Enter - it should add a blank line above and not change the indent of the current line, but it changes the indent to match the one of the first non-empty line above.\nIt should be very easy to fix and Scintilla already supports this behavior.\nDon't get me wrong, I like Notepad++ a lot and I use it daily, in fact for me that's the only annoying thing about it.. Thanks to @A-R-C-A for pointing the function which maintains the indentation:\nvoid Notepad_plus::maintainIndentation(TCHAR ch) in Notepad_plus.cpp\nI reviewed the code and the problem is in this function indeed.\nIt's easy to spot that it looks for a non-empty previous line:\n// Search the non-empty previous line\n            while (prevLine >= 0 && _pEditView->getLineLength(prevLine) == 0)\n                prevLine--;\nIt doesn't care what is the current cursor position.\nThe fix is quite easy, get the current position by calling _pEditView->execute(SCI_GETCURRENTPOS) and if it matches the beginning of the line (not sure if it's 0 or 1) then do nothing.\nI don't know any other editor which messes with the indentation when you're in the beginning of the line and you press Enter.\nInitially I thought that this is something managed by Scintilla but now I see that this is completely custom Notepad++ code, which explains why no other editor does the same.. I just created a PR which should fix the issue, but I haven't tested it.\nFurther optimizations are possible because some code is repeated in multiple places, but I decided to do it with minimal changes.\nI didn't use _pEditView->execute(SCI_GETCURRENTPOS) because it returns the position from the beginning of the document, not in the current line. To determine if we were at the beginning of the line I am checking the length of the previous line. Probably this change is making the search for non-empty previous line redundant.\nI hope that @donho will find some time to review the PR.. That's true, but the change is minimal and I can't afford to spend a lot of time to create environment where I can build Notepad++. Also previous messages state that it's not easy to build it anyway.. ",

    "DavidBailey100": "I wish this dialog would have explicit search up and search down buttons. Sure you can set the direction to 'up', but then that remains set and thus easily messes up subsequent searches.\n. A related problem is that the function list does not include functions whose declarations start\nextern \"C\" .........\n. CR stands for carriage return (ASCII decimal code 13), LF stands for line feed (ASCII decimal code 10).\nWindows text lines normally end with CR LF, although most software doesn't care if the CR is missing. Unix/Linux text lines end in LF only. The NUL is a character with Ascii code 0. Nul characters should not appear in ordinary text files.\nClearly this problem has nothing to do with Notepad++, it is an error in your program. I would use a hex editor, such as XV132 to explore this.\n. I agree, it is quite rare to want to search for something else, and not want to change the replacement - and it can be very dangerous as the OP illustrates. I would suggest the best thing would be offer a list of strings and replacement string pairs but wipe out the current replacement almost as the OP suggests.\nHowever, leaving an empty replacement string isn't very safe either! Perhaps the replacement string should be $\u00a3$\u00a3$\u00a3$\u00a3$\u00a3$\u00a3$\u00a3 - i.e. something that can be easily found and corrected even after a careless replacement had been made and NP++ closed (because otherwise the answer is simply Undo!\n.

The code here and linked is what Notepad2 used to toggle fold n-level for Python, which works fine.\nThe level stack is used to compute how many levels current line is, regardless of what indentation is used.\nThat is: the first line that starts a fold has level 1, it's first child line that starts a fold has level 2, etc.\nSee the following code, each line has different indentation amount, apparently has only three levels.\npython\n       def func():                       # line 1, level 1\n          if True:                         # line 2, level 2\n                   if True:                # line 3, level 3\n                       # stmt1          # line 4\n          if False:                        # line 5, level 2\n                         if False:         # line 6, level 3\n                             # stmt2    # line 7\nThe EditFoldStack_Push works by pop off all brother levels and their child levels. and set the stack top to level for current line. if a level is larger than the top level (no pop off), it must a child of top level. so the level count in the stack is the 1-based level number for current line.\n.

In inline IME mode, application will receive unexpected SCN_CHARADD  before input is full composited, which may cause unexpected auto-completion and auto close quotes.\n. Believe me or not, this is a feature \ud83d\ude02.\nThe problem is that, in Scintilla fold.cpp.comment.explicit ( defined in LexCPP.cxx) is enabled by default, and the default fold.cpp.explicit.start is defined as //{ and fold.cpp.explicit.end is defined as //}.\nThat is it will fold code like this\nc\n//{ folding start\n...\n//} folding end\nSince Notepad++ explicitly set fold.comment to 1 (the default is 0), all languages (C/C++, ObjC, JavaScript, C#, Java, Resource Script, ActionScript, JSON ,Swift) use LexCPP (SCLEX_CPP) will behave like this.\nCode from LexCPP.cxx:\n```cpp\nDefineProperty(\"fold.comment\", &OptionsCPP::foldComment,\n    \"This option enables folding multi-line comments and explicit fold points when using the C++ lexer. \"\n    \"Explicit fold points allows adding extra folding by placing a //{ comment at the start and a //} \"\n    \"at the end of a section that should fold.\");\nDefineProperty(\"fold.cpp.comment.multiline\", &OptionsCPP::foldCommentMultiline,\n    \"Set this property to 0 to disable folding multi-line comments when fold.comment=1.\");\nDefineProperty(\"fold.cpp.comment.explicit\", &OptionsCPP::foldCommentExplicit,\n    \"Set this property to 0 to disable folding explicit fold points when fold.comment=1.\");\nDefineProperty(\"fold.cpp.explicit.start\", &OptionsCPP::foldExplicitStart,\n    \"The string to use for explicit fold start points, replacing the standard //{.\");\nDefineProperty(\"fold.cpp.explicit.end\", &OptionsCPP::foldExplicitEnd,\n    \"The string to use for explicit fold end points, replacing the standard //}.\");\n```. Isn't  XML/HTML folding based on start and end tag?\nScintilla's current folding for VB/VBS is based on indentation (like Python) not keyword. There are other implementations using keyword based folding..

    "SMcCandlish": "This is pretty important. The ability to set a \"vertical edge\" of the rightmost column (technically known as the Philip bar) is effectively useless if text cannot be soft or (optionally) hard wrapped to it.\nFrankly, this is the only non-trivial GUI-based text editor I've ever used that doesn't have this feature, and the lack of it is painful.  People working with text often have to have the final output wrapped to a particular column (80 or quite often less than 80, with 79, 78, and 72 being common values for various purposes), and need to be able to preview how this lays out while editing, but without forcing hard line breaks until the final text is completed.\nThe current behavior of the \"View > Word wrap\" option wrapping to current window width is of very limited utility, mostly for people on netbooks or other small-screen devices.  Nice to have as an option, I suppose, but as the only option, it's inadequate.\nFurther comments, on implementation options, at #1140.. This is a good idea, for how to resolve #482.  However, if it's easier to just do a preferences/options setting, and we'd get the feature (matching the line wrapping to the \"Vertical edge\" setting) faster that way, then by all means implement it the expedient way, at least initially.  Just please DO implement it. Lack of this feature is why I can't use Notepad++as my main Windows text editor; this feature is just basic and important.. ",

    "bpersonick": "@Sandeep\nTL;DR:\nC comments do not allow // prior to C99  when the C++ feature was\nback-ported into the C language ( See:\nhttps://developerinsider.co/c-programming-language-version-history/,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#Syntax, and\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_syntax#Comments )\nThe True C Programmer is the one most likely to be opening and editing C\nCode in Notepad ++, while C++ and C# code is more likely to be developed\nelsewhere and use Notepad ++  to make quick review of or edits to that code\n(Although that is not to say it is uncommon for some C++ or C# Developer to\nutilize NP++ for all of their work!).\nIt can be shown that there is a real and perceived value to a separation\nof the C Syntax and Highlighting from that of C++ and C# within the\nbuilt-in syntax highlighting and commenting of NP++.\nThis would benefit those who truly write C code as they often maintain\nlegacy systems requiring the code be compiled under truly old versions of\nthe C compiler to ensure functionality on the target systems, and could\neasily be implemented as a global preference, and a per file toggle by\nseparating the Syntaxes within NP++ and adding such preference guidelines\non which to use when opening .c and .h files (vs file types only associated\nwith the newer languages such as .cpp which would not need such a\npreference)\nMore info and thoughts follow:\n================\nmaiantain the and HoweverTrue C Comments should follow the / / method for\ncompatibility as C++ is not a true superset of C, and should be treated as\na separate syntax instead of being lumped in with C++ and C#.\nThe single Line comment using // was introduced as a feature in the first\nversion of C++ in 1983,  It was not was backported as a feature into C\nuntil 1999 as part of the C99 Standard.\nSo from the perspective of compatibility, one-line comments using\n/[LINE(S)]/ may appear in any code for any version of C, C++, or C# as\nthe / / feature allows any length comment.\n// also, unline / / always flows to the end of the line\nwhere implemented, while / / can be used to start or end mid-line\ncommenting only a sub-portion of code on a given line.\nHowever / / does not nest, so commenting a section with comments inside\nof it will not work, leading to needing to create several sets of comments,\nor situations where programmers will generate IF structures around the\narea to be commented (eg IF 1==0 { THis is all / commented/ hahahahaha!}\ndefeating the purpose of the comment feature in the first place.\nThis is the need that the // style comment was designed to address, as the\nonly ending operator is the carriage return, you may use it to comment out\nlarge blocks of code, which may themselves have / / style or // style\ncomments inside of them without causing a conflict in the commenting\nrequiring you to spend a lot of time fix umteen hours debugging the comment\nitself or cludging in your own IF $false = $true style comments.\nIt is only on rare occasions you might be looking at old code, and the\nsyntax highlighting will respect either style comments, so that is not an\nissue.\nThe only thing which may be an issue is edge cases where programmers need\nto use old compilers prior to C99 to compile their code.  If the programmer\nmay compile the code in at least the C99 compiler with confidence that the\nresulting executable will run on the system they plan to use it on, then\nthey have no worries.\nSo the only time a requirement to use / / arises reasonably is when any\ndeveloper to this day wishes to make a within-line comment, a multi-line\ncomment that ends mid-line (as any comment may start mid-line, and the edge\ncase scenario where someone is maintaining systems which are running\ndecades-old code (Which is an admirable task, and one that is far more\ncommon than many would believe, but is not the normal position of a\ndeveloper.)\nThat stated, it is far more likely for today's Developer to be writing in\nC# or C++ and using a modern compiler there-of or using a C++ or C#\ncompiler.ng Code in C, as opposed to C++ or C# is expressly doing so to\nmaintain compatible code for older systems, and would likely benefit from\nhaving the Syntax highlighting and commenting separated from the C++and C#\nmethods instead of having this agglomerated styling and commenting class.\nThis is especially true as today, those who are truly programming in C\n(as opposed to C++ or C#) are inherently in the practice of maintaining\nlegacy systems which likely require them to utilize specific compilers to\nwrite and amend code which will be compatible on these systems.\nAs C++ and C# have many viable IDEs and syntax highlighting methods,\ndirectly and indirectly, available to them, it is actually the C programmer\nwho would have the most incentive to utilize Notepad++ to review and write\ncode, while the C++ or C# programmer is more incentivized to use notepad++\nfor quick edits and review of code when they don't wnst need a full burden\nof other tools to be in the way.\nThese facts support the Idea of requiring a syntax and commenting\ndifference be available as a default option within the in-built Syntax and\ncommenting methods for C/C++/C# as their agglomeration into a single bucket\nhas hindered the true C programmer, the individual most in need of a\nproduct such as Notepad ++ to modernize their work,\nIt is therefore appropriate, that we consider a method of separating C\nsyntax Highlighting and commenting from that of C++ or C#, in a way that\nmay be easily controllable as a global level preference, and toggle-able at\na per file instance\nOn Sat, Oct 20, 2018 at 4:14 AM Sandeep Pandey notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI know this issue is old, but just out of curiosity, could someone provide\na reference link which states that single line comments in C should use /\n/ notation and not //\nFrom what I could find online, the C11\nhttp://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1570.pdf & C17\nhttp://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/abq/c17_updated_proposed_fdis.pdf\nstandards accepts both ways of commenting.\nRefer to section 6.4.9 on comments\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/484#issuecomment-431559686,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/An_Ew1CXB3muJRpf9rdULfVcA1bzdN0Kks5umttNgaJpZM4FXMBG\n.\n.

So please don't add back as it would be orphane.\nThese were just examples, not commenting all changes in this PU.\n. Hi bovirus!\nYes I know of the background of your request. I answered in the Italian topic at the forum. \nI also created a new topic mentioning the actually needed strings.\nBut for completeness here is my comments for all these changes:\nItem id=\"43054\" name=\"Mark...\"\nEDIT: This one is indeed needed, it's used. So it's valid request to add it to the master.\nItem id=\"44011\" name=\"Custom settings window...\"\nAs above explained, this item is not anymore used since approx 6.5. Not needed.\nItem id = \"44012\" name = \"Hide line number margin\"\nItem id = \"44013\" name = \"Hide bookmark margin\"\nItem id = \"44014\" name = \"Hide folder margin\"\nThese 3 items are only appearing in menu if \"Customize Toolbar\" plugin is installed. These are needed and valid.\nItem id=\"47004\" name=\"Forum\" \nItem id=\"47008\" name=\"Help...\" \nThis 2 were removed by Don Ho couple of days ago, since another method, Online chat was included instead of Help. And the Forum was removed due to this new forum. Not needed.\nItem id=\"1640\" name=\"Switch window\"\nThis is not anymore used since apporx 5.5 version. Not needed.\nUnder StylerDialog title=\"Styler Dialog\"\nItem id = \"1\" name = \"&OK\"\nItem id = \"2\" name = \"&Cancel\"\nThese are used and indeed missing from master. Valid.\nCreateNewLanguage title=\"Create new language...\"\nItem id=\"1\"     name=\"OK\" \nItem id=\"2\"     name=\"Cancel\"\nItem id=\"26001\" name=\"Name:\" \n/CreateNewLanguage\nThis window is although existing in program, but this translation is not picked up by the program, so it should not be in master.xml as it would be considered orphan. Anyway, there are also other similar windows there, like \"Rename current language name\" which are not translated anyway. So Not needed.\nItem id=\"6121\" name=\"Menu bar\"\nThis was changed some time ago, the window was a bit reorganized in Settings. This item is not used anymore. Not needed.\nItem id=\"6510\" name=\"Use default value\"\nItem id=\"6510\" name=\"Use default value\"\nI don't understand why you would move this string from the Tab settings into the compact Language section, because this is at the correct place. No need to change.\nItem id=\"6257\" name=\"bla bla bla bla bla bla\"\nItem id=\"6258\" name=\"bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla\"\nThis 2 is indeed used, and missing from master English. Even thought the text can be understood probably also on other langauges. :)\nItem id=\"6264\" name=\"Dropbox\"\nItem id=\"6265\" name=\"OneDrive\"\nItem id=\"6266\" name=\"Google Drive\"\nThis Cloud related change was done couple of days ago by Don Ho, so probably these are not anymore used. However we can't even test it since that new version of program was not yet release, I think. Not needed.\nHope is useful for you.\nOne general comment: please don't spam all the topics with your specific work, and don't try to force every translator bugging about how much is updated or not. I explained that in the Italian topic.\nAlso, think twice about suggesting changes in english.xml as it's Don Ho's reponsibility. Also, sometime including a string in english.xml alone is not enough, if the program itself doen't pick up the text. So often, program code modification is needed to add new translation. See \"Create new language\" example above. In this case it's better not to include it in XML.  But this is completely belongs to Don. The only cases when english.xml maybe worth to update alone, when some items are in fact picked up by the program and missing. So rather ask forum first in the appropriate topic.\nRegards\nGy\u00f6rgy \n. I have edited the 4th post since I made a mistake for below item first.\nItem id=\"43054\" name=\"Highlight...\"\nand it's actuall:\nItem id=\"43054\" name=\"Mark...\"\nThis one is used, so it's needed.\n.

Has it got a new a ID maybe? \nEither please correct the code so that it should pickup the translation, or if it needs a change in english.xml then please change it!\nRegards\nGy\u00f6rgy\n. @cmeriaux\nYes it's present , and it was indeed fixed not long ango, probably around 2015-05-10 which you refer.\nBut currently it went bad again, again not translated as it was before that patch. \nSo now, the translation is not picked up, even if it's included.\n.

Hi @cmeriaux ,\nThanks! It's strange. The ANSI version appear during the installation wizard, during step \"Choose Components\", under Custom option, under Localization. I think the installer somehow adds it always automatically from the normal UTF-8 file PowerEditor\\installer\\nativeLang\\hungarian.xml, Somewhere it's hardcoced. But where?. Hi again,\nAt least the ANSI version is referred at this point in repo:\nnotepad-plus-plus/PowerEditor/installer/nsisInclude/langs.nsh\n. @donho I've updated the missing parts for the new word character list feature in 7.3.1.\nPlease be noted: I'm quiet disappointed that 7.3 translation update was still not included in 7.3.1 release!

Hi @rddim \nStrange that.\nI checked once more. Steps 1,2,3 with F\u00e1jln\u00e9v gives again same e2d72255c7341a5e4f684b9dd2ece36c, and it doesn't change with system language. Apparantly it gives the same checksum as online MD5 generators. \nStep 4,5,6 gives again 2a7ca5d580df9da7e7839acc39d4ea05 to me, regardless if I use English or Hungarian system language. So it's not changing for me in Win8.1. Anyway it seems to be wrong when using the MD5 window.\nMaybe it's also related to encoding, no sure..

    "Joe136": "_the website seem's temporarily in static offline mode_\nYes, I think that's the problem.\nI've checked the HTTP request of the updater.

I'm not sure, if this will help to download the plugins itself.\n. After you have downloaded the plugins.zip, extract it. There is the file PluginManagerPlugins.xml.\nCopy the file to C:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Notepad++\\plugins\\config\\ (alternative %AppData%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\config\\).

As long the plugins cannot be downloaded, you will not need the plugins.zip because you can't download (and install) the plugins, too. You have to backup every plugin, too.\n. It would be nice to have a better explanation instead of \"Installation of plugin failed\" (it can be any reason for it), maybe \"Download of plugin failed\". Additionally a small message that the plugin manager couldn't update the plugin list (PluginManagerPlugins.xml) would be nice, too.\n. ",

The hash still match.\nI believe, the trouble is gone for now... and sourceforge (some part) is still under maintenance...\nIn the futur, to prevent this trouble, it won't be better to provide a backup via the GitHub (or something else) ?\n. I see now, thank you and specially for the explanation. I don't check the latest version (6.8) but I assume it's still the same (according to the changelog).\n. I don't met the trouble with another plugin (like Combine, Compare, etc). Also, I only have a few plugins (<10).\nOn the moment, I didn't believe that I need to precise that. For me, it's normal. So, yes I have them (as I'm the administrator). \n. Sorry I forgot to mention, I don't have the issue with Windows 8.1. Nevertheless, like said I don't know (or remember) the reason. There are a lot of program... And if I proceed a clean reinstallation, yes it will appear. Because I'm remember that I already met the problem by the past but it's old...\nEdit 14/08:\nMy first attemp was to copy under Windows 10 the folder (program) and it's fail... Basically, if the plugin (PyNPP) is already installed, Notepad++ will disable it because the PC doesn't have the right program. The PC don't met the minimum requirements. That's why you will get this message : \nhttp://nsa38.casimages.com/img/2016/08/14/16081406153922137.png\n```\nOne copy (screen 3): The plugin PyNPP is not compatible with current version of Notepad++.\nDo you want to remove this plugin from plugins directory to prevent this message from the next launch time?\nVisual C++ 2005 Redistributable WithSP1 (x86)_v8.0.56336\nVisual C++ 2005 Redistributable WithSP1 (x64)_v8.0.56336\nVisual C++ 2008 Redistributable WithSP1 (x64)_v9.0.30729.17\nVisual C++ 2008 Redistributable WithSP1 (x86)_v9.0.30729.17\nVisual C++ 2010 Redistributable WithSP1 (x64)_v10.0.40219\nVisual C++ 2012 Redistributable For Visual Studio 2012 Update4 (x64)_v11.0.61030\nVisual C++ 2012 Redistributable For Visual Studio 2012 Update4 (x86)_v11.0.61030\nVisual C++ 2013 Redistributable For Visual Studio 2013 UpdateWhichOne ?

I checked each program one by one and nothing in the list (just above) was able to fix the problem.\nTo conclude, the solution consist to install the : \"Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable WithSP1 (x86)_v10.0.40219\".\nPS : Microsoft has published an article about the Visual C++ Redistributable Package. I discover this article a few days ago and it seem's to provide the latest version or a full list. Indeed, the list is quite long.\n. You closed and it seem's you couldn't give even a little word (or interest) about the suggestion... No point with Notepad++ ? The Plugin Manager wasn't build by the same author, I'm wrong ? It's an important part of Notepad++, no ?\nSorry but no, it's not clear and also in that case, what's the right place (between GitHub(s), SourceForge, the Community N++ , etc) ? Maybe you didn't understand ? Maybe you can't make a transfert ? I don't have a huge knowledge about Notepad++ (GitHub etc).\nFrom my point of view, that's weird because the installation was launched via the NotePad++ Plugin Manager. Apparently, it seem's to be a little lack about him. After all, he never purpose me a solution. Also at the first time, the problem (or the origin) is absolutely not clear. Why he never give me even a very short explanation (or a little track to follow) ? Bless my memory because no, I wasn't lucky when I searched (several times) on the internet...\nBasically, I had wait a few months before I finally decide to create this report. I have been quite patient and I don't ask too much... one sign (of life etc)... If they don't seem to see the little idea which can perhaps improve (a bit) Notepad++. Then, I won't because and I don't see the point.., the report is done, I have done enough. \nKind regards.\n. Usually, it's the Normal Text File (by default when I create new .txt file). But I had try also with Python (and as you can guess none change).\nEdit January 2018 :\nOne little bad news, because Notepad++_v7.5.4 was published a few days ago and no the trouble wasn't corrected.\nAt the contrary, after a moment (about 20 days) I had discover on my own one solution for (the addon) RequestControl but the topic is closed and that's just bad... Because nobody take a little time to inform me about the new release. And as another fact, at the moment indeed RequestControl was buggy... Even at the end, it was replace by RequestControl_v1.8.4.\nThen to resume the solution was to update RequestControl_v1.8.3 to RequestControl_v1.8.6  and for now it seem's to work fine.\n. ",

I can easily spend 60 seconds \nlooking at the window flash (that's another annoying feature while \nbuilding the list). Which makes any window switch counter productive. I \nhave reverted to using direct Linux text edition through ssh :-) (old \nschool).\nI'm working on a rather large project with thousands of files, some of \nwhich are very large objects.\nJust to be completely thorough, this is the first time I've tried this \nVPN - Notepad++ on my upgraded Windows 10 machine, Before that, my dev \nmachine was on Windows 7\nJacques\nOn 10/28/2015 10:51 AM, jmarrec wrote:\n\nSalut Jacques,\nCan't you just close the function pane in that case when you're over VPN?\n(Or download the file to your local machine but that's probably \nsomething you don't want to do)\nJulien\nEnvoy\u00e9 de mon iPhone\n\nLe 28 oct. 2015 \u00e0 18:38, Jacques Amar notifications@github.com a \n\u00e9crit :\nJust to add my 2c, I often program over a slow VPN and the issue is \nextremely debilitating in that case.

Another option to fix this compile error is to disable the warning.\nMany Visual C++ warnings are frivolous and unproductive.  Disabling them is not only the easy solution, but quite often also the smart one.. in C++ 0 != '0'   This needs to be rewritten as either:\nreturn std::pair<unsigned char, unsigned char>((unsigned char)0, (unsigned char)0);\nor optionally, using escape character  syntax for ASCII NUL:\nreturn std::pair<unsigned char, unsigned char>('\\0', '\\0');. in C/C++,  0 != '0'  -- This needs to be changed.

So more generally this request should be 'don't have invisible characters when 'Show All Characters' is enabled.\nIn fact even without 'show all chars' invisible characters are bad business and should probably be shown somehow like symbols without a match in current font.\nNot sure but I think this should be a request from Scintilla rather than NPP.\n. In my opinion first BOM at the beginning of the file should not be shown because it is not part of the document. It is something that is added automatically on 'save' and skipped automatically on 'open'.\n. I started posting a ticket in Scintilla forum and decided to test it before posting.\nSo Notepad++ (and Scintilla) does show a middle BOM as an invalid char (which the font does not recognize). You can copy paste the BOM into the find dialog to find additional BOMs.\nSo while it may be nice to have to add BOM as special character I don't think it is worth the effort.\nAnd then I re read your first comment entirely and so this info was already there.

How can I make it more clear?. >  You want a capability to convert your text\nNo. I want this:\nWhen I press tab key, Notepad++ should determinate if current line contains at least one non-tab character (even space!), but only on the left side from current position of cursor.\n- If there is at least one non-tab character, 4 spaces should be inserted (or less, if CUR_COLON % 4 > 0).\n- If there is only tab characters or no characters, 1 tab character should be inserted.\nExamples:\n\nAABBCC\u275aDDEE \u2014 2 spaces should be inserted after pressing TAB\nAABBCCD\u275aDEE \u2014 1 space should be inserted after pressing TAB\nAABBCCDD\u275aEE \u2014 4 spaces should be inserted after pressing TAB\n\u275aAABBCCDDEE \u2014 1 TAB should be inserted after pressing TAB\n_\u275aAABBCCDDE \u2014 3 spaces should be inserted after pressing TAB because string already contains one SPACE on the left side from cursor, and space is non-tab character\n\u2192\u2192\u2192\u275aAABBCC \u2014 1 TAB should be inserted after pressing TAB because there is only tabs on the left side from cursor\n\nExample based on the real code:\nif (true) {\n\u2192const ab = 5;   //some comment\n\u2192             \u275a//continues on the next line\n}\nIn this example two spaces should be inserted because line contains spaces on the left side from cursor. Yeah, that line will contain 1 tab and 16 spaces after pressing TAB. That means every line may contain spaces and tabs at the same time. That's because indent should done by tabs, but align should be done by spaces. Indent and align are NOT SAME THINGS. YOU SHOULDN'T USE TABS FOR ALIGNMENT OR SPACES FOR INDENT. YOU SHOULD USE TABS FOR INDENT AND SPACES FOR ALIGNMENT.\nWhat I want\nI don't want some features to replace some characters in existing code; it can be done automatically by other tools or plugins. I want the right working after pressing TAB key.\nPS. Also when I press Shift+Tab Notepad++ should delete one tab from the beginning of a line.\n- If few lines are selected then Notepad++ should not delete beginning spaces because in that case after DOUBLE pressing Shift+Tab such code\n  \u2192const a = 5,\n  \u2192      b = 6;\n  would be converted to\n  const a = 5,\n    b = 6; //Bad result. Notepad++ should not do that.\n  Spaces are used for alignment and Notepad++ should not delete them.\n- But when only one line is selected, Notepad++ can delete spaces because in that case I have totally control on the deleting process. Example:\n  const a = 5;\n         var b = 6;\u275a\n  When I press Shift+Tab first time 4 spaces will be deleted. When I press Shift+Tab second time left 3 spaces will be deleted.\n- OPTIONALLY: When more than one line selected you cannot unindent old code uses spaces instead of tabs anymore. To solve this problem I would add combination to replace all beginning spaces with tabs in the selected text. Example of using:\n  - Press Ctrl+T\n  - Type \"4\" in opened window to replace every 4 beginning spaces with 1 tab\n  - Click \"OK\"\nOf course, this is dangerous feature because Notepad++ cannot be sure for every space if it used for indentation or for alignment. Example:\nif (true) {\n      const a = 5,\n            b = 6;\n  }\nAfter auto-conventing this will be converted to\n  if (true) {\n  \u2192const a = 5,\n  \u2192\u2192 b = 6;\n  }\nIt's wrong conversion because if someone uses spaces instead of tabs Notepad++ cannot know are some spaces used for indent or align.\nOf course if someone always use spaces instead of tabs it's wrong too because different people use different tab size and alignment will be broken in this case. Nobody should use tabs instead of spaces. And nobody should use spaces instead of tabs.\nBig problem\nVery big problem is Notepad++ always inserts tab or always inserts spaces. It's VERY WRONG.. I guess many people don't know what is tab indent space align style, what is different between alignment and indentation and why nobody should use spaces instead of tabs and tabs instead of spaces.\nI though everybody know it. Do you think I should recreate this issue with better explaining by steps in first comment? This is very important feature that Notepad++ doesn't have. I would say it is basic feature people can't program without. That means Notepad++ cannot be used for writing program code at all.. > FYI people have been programming for decades without the feature.\nWell, you are right and what I said is not true :) Of course everybody can program even without TAB key on the keyboard :) That's what I'm doing right now :) It's not convenient.. > one of those features that causes more problems/confusion when not implemented correctly\nI don't understand you. Implementing is very easy, Notepad++ should just insert tabs in the beginning of a string and spaces if at least one non-tab character was typed (including space).\n. Because nobody respond me a long time. I wouldn't duplicate any issue except very and very critical bugs, vulnerabilities and features.\nImagine editor with semicolon key doesn't work. What would you say? Yeah, you can use Ctrl+V or ComposeKey but\u2026\nIf the editor doesn't have for example C++ lang support, it's OK. But if some keys don't work, it's very bad because it become difficult to write code in any language\u2026. Actually there is 3 styles of code:\n1. All with tabs \u2014 very bad style and should not be used by anyone.\n2. All with spaces \u2014 very bad style and should not be used by anyone.\n3. Indent with tabs and align with spaces \u2014 very good style without any defects.\nAnd... what do you think? Notepad++ supports first two bad styles and does not support third style.\nGreat)\nAlso there is 4th style \u2014 mixing tabs and spaces. Of course it is bad style and should not be used by anyone. Nobody should mix tabs and spaces.. up. up. Yeah, a beep sound, I just forgot the word, thanks.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the Shortcut Mapper did not display \"CONFLICT FOUND\" for the Alt-S combo... which I think it probably should.\n\nOh, yes. It means there is 3 bugs in 1:\n- First bug: Beep sound.\n- Second bug: Menu opening if there is shortcut for the menu.\n- Third bug: Not displaying \"CONFLICT FOUND\" (but it shouldn't if first two bug will be fixed).. Thanks, it will prevent menu opening but will not prevent beep sound.. ",

It is CA system flawed.\n\nImagine that someone needs to run Notepad++ as administrator - he also gets the same message.\n\nNot a problem. A powerful malicious entity can get a valid cert for any name it wants. Also a just malicious entity can find a homeless person, wash him, pay him for changing his legal name to Don Ho and pay him for getting a valid cert in a completely official way. How can you be sure that Don Ho is the person you mean, not another person with the same name? The only way to ensure this is to get public key personally from a person whoose traits you know well enough to spot the fake. Or public key fingerprint, if you assumme that the hash function is secure, but IMHO it is far more secure and nearly as easy to get the key directly.\nSo the only security we have when using software by unknown persons from the internet is Trust on First Use. You know what the public key is used to be and watch the changes in it. And you hope that the time you have acquired it first it was by the right person, not CIA. Surely it will fail in the world where everyone is mitmed with high probability, but we don't live in such a world, otherwise it would have been already spotted.. >RSA 2048\n4096 is minimum.. >So what's the next step?\nGo to https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/ and paste there your public key. Also add it into your GitHub profile and NPP website and sign and push some tags/commits using this keypair into NPP repo. Also you would need some of your friends you personally know, who are well-known devs, to sign your public key (offline, meeting them personally!), and then publish the public key with their signatures.. >That way, you will publish it in four different places. \nAll of which are under either NSA or GCHQ jurisdiction.\n\nI would suggest to use primarily the pgp.mit.edu\n\nI used to use it, but it has heen down for some time, so I have switched to Ubuntu one.\n\n\nAre you using some good antivirus program on your build machine?\nWhich one do you suggest?\n\n\nThere is ain't no such a thing, as a good AV. They are mostly based on signatures, signatures need to be reguoarily updated because there exist such a tool as packer, defeating signature analysis. A malware that rooted your system can install a kernel module protecting it from being removed and/or detected. It is called rootkit. Though they can be detected by a class of tools called \"red pills\" using unforgeable timer, but this is heavy artillery. For better persistence malware can create a bios/uefi module and flash it into bios. For extreme persistence malware can infect peripherials firmwares too. And this technique has been used by malicious actors, according to Kaspersky Lab.\nYou shouldn't use AV, you should use isolation; you should not allow any unapproved code to gain access to your private key, source code in process or before build and the built binaries before signing. And I feel that backdoors may be problems here, you should not keep your private keys on machines backdoored by hardware or software vendors.\nTo protect your key you can use a hardware security module. They generate keypairs inside of it and then you use software to send data to the module and module signs the data and returns you the signature. You can upgrade your key by signing new public key with old private key, prooving your ownership of the old key, then start using tue new key, and after some time enough revoke the old key.\nPlease hote that not all HSMs are really HSMs. There were some devices marketed as hsms, but in fact the researchers found that private keys were extractable.. >Since early 2000-s we've got behavioural detection of malware\nWhich works damn bad and giving lots of false positives.\n\nThere are viruses which search for source code files on developer machines and are attaching themselves to those sources, so the resulting binary is infected.\n\nOn needs not to have any active malware on the machine.\n\nIt is especially seen in the software build labs where the same binary could be different even if build on the same machine using the same source code.\n\nI wonder what prevents modifying compilers and linkers the way making the builds reproducible? Everything is needed to make the build reproducible is a predictable RNG, non-writing any additional metainformation got from FS, system clock and static libraries built reproducibly. Why do people create virtual environments with the tools like gitian rather than to just patch the toolchains to do the work?. >Not for Notepad++ website & its binaries - they are hosted in France.\nFrance has own intelligence agencies, France is a member of NATO and France can do favour to their US ally. There were multiple cases of Russian citizens captured in Europe and deported to US, including the ones doing legal business in Russia, which was outlawed by US. I am mean Alexander Vinnick - a person related to russian cryptocurrency exchange BTCe not complying to US KYC laws. He was captured in Greece and deported into US.\nOne must understand that if something is beneficial to both states (in the case of Vinnik - US and Greece, though we don;t know the benefit of Greece), they will make an aggreement. For example, if US can promise France to install their backdoors too, France can help US in their espionage. This is mutually beneficial for them.\nThere are also such things as business interests. If one business can be affected by a foreign state a lot, for example access to their servers can be blocked in that state, it will comply. An example of that is Russia forcing Google and Amazon to implement anti-meek countermeasures in order not to be blocked. Or Google creating a censored version of their search engine.\nIMHO if Snowden gone to France, he would be already deported to US and prosecuted.. >The above public key has been submitted in the following keyservers:\nA key uploaded into 1 keyserver is automatically synced to other ones.. >Download Notepad++ source code of current version and/or check sha-256 digests for binary packages on GitHub\nSHA256 digests computed by GH and signature validation done by GH is untrusted. Everyone should do own one.\n\nmay be useful to show the key fingerprint on the site and github readme, (highlighting the key id portion of it )\n\n@donho plese notice that short fingerprints are insecure, one should always use full ones if he uses fingerprints.. >and then NoScript shows it runs weird 3rd party scripts that auto-forward to another domain for me in Fx but not GC browser.\nDeserves some investigation.\n\nIs there data that says the 7z format is more \"popular\" than the zip format?\n\nOn almost every computer I have seen either 7zip or WinRar is installed. I prefer 7z + LZMA + 9 (lzma is single threaded, but compresses better than lzma2, though usually it is fast enough not to bother about it being single threaded) over rar or rar5 because of its better compression.. Thereis a workaround: you can edit gpup.exe with text editor, locate XML manifest there, replace \"requireAdministrator\" to \"asInvoker\". Of course digital signatures will be broken, but it worked. The drawback is that you will have to do this on every npp update (or make it read-only).. >Multi-Line?\nYes.\n\nThe tabs in multi-line are now buttons in order to maintain the active tab's row. Previously, the active tab's row moved to the front/bottom which is confusing and caused reordering/sorting of tabs to be difficult.\n\nI know. \n\nThe margins around button-tabs is an unfortunate limitation in Window's TabControl.\n\nCould you explain more clearly why is it necessary to make tabs buttons and why isn't it possible to solve that issue in another way?. >The tabs in multi-line are now buttons in order to maintain the active tab's row. Previously, the active tab's row moved to the front/bottom which is confusing and caused reordering/sorting of tabs to be difficult.\nIt's not an explanation. It is description. The explanation is the cause of that reordering.\n\nWindow's TabControl has no other way. The other solution is to replace Window's TabControl with something else entirely.\n\nSo why this way have not been chosen? Do workarounds like creating an own TabControl instance per line and process dragging between different lines in npp code make much troubles?. @donho. BTW, why not to use GH pages for the website (it's static anyway)?. >\"xyz.sh didn't exist; would I like to create it?\".\nThe problem is triggered when\n1 you initiate opening when a file with another path is open\n2 you insert full path there\nyou don't see xyz.sh, in fact there is garbage after it\nAnd longer the path of currently opened file - more the garbage will be in the end.\n\nIt seems that string terminator is missing.\n. @dail8859 thank you for the hint. It was really implemented via a plugin!\n. One can put patches into a separate dir and apply them, for example with git am. But what prevents the changes from being merged into upstream?.

If somebody would fix it there then it would work in Notepad++ too.\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/bugs/1595/\nFor those with programming skills: Scintilla code uses e.g. type int for filesize and structures in memory => 2GB limit.

Also, when cutting some of these files to ~21,000 lines solved the problem, while at ~23,000 lines the problem still existed.\nThis seems to only happen when using grouping and on files over a certain length.  In one file, splitting it in two allowed me to find no matches of (?<=\\d{8}(,|:) ).*?(?=>|\\)), while keeping the file whole resulted in the regex selecting the whole file.  Strangely, though searching for (?<=\\d{4}(,|:) ).*?(?=>|\\)) in the same files worked ok - where the length of digits in the first grouping was 4 instead of 8, otherwise identical!\nAlso, in another search I modified one of the original regexs in my question on StackOverflow from (first|middle|last|account)Name: .*$ to (first|middle|last)Name: .*$ and that also started working, as did keeping the same regex and halfing the length of the file.  I also tried (rst|dle|ast|unt)Name: .*$, which failed and (first|middle|account)Name: .*$, which worked, all of which is pretty random and can't be tied down to any one thing being the problem.\nThis leads me to believe that there is a fundamental problem in the regex engine and as a result we are now ditching Notepad++ as a solution and are purchasing something else instead as the regex engine cannot be relied upon to be correct.\n.

    "jhuebel": "Figured it out. This should probably still be considered a workaround since it occurs only when there are old cache files left over in NppFTP's cache directory.\nI recently moved from CodeIgniter 2.x to 3.x. That included renaming files from \"thisfile.php\" to \"Thisfile.php\". Since there was an old cached copy of \"thisfile.php\" still on my computer (perhaps from a crashed session or something), when NppFTP downloaded a new copy of the renamed file (\"Thisfile.php\"), Windows treated it as updating the cached copy (\"thisfile.php\").\nBasically, this boils down to Windows being stupid about case sensitive file naming. Windows really treats \"Thisfile.php\" and \"thisfile.php\" has the same filename, even though other (much more intelligent) operating systems honor the case sensitive naming and treat them as two different filenames.\n. It is limited to NppFTP, since it's a dirty cache problem. It's further limited to opening a remote file from a filesystem that properly handles case-sensitive file naming (Unix variants). So, I doubt this affects opening a file from a Windows machine (local or remote). Windows only superficially supports case sensitive filenames.\n. ",

    "GaryBloom": "I tested npp7.5.4 and KlausiD's enhancements were not implemented. Assuming that KlausiD modified the 7.4.2 sources, I went through the process of integrating those changes into the 7.5.4 source files and tested. The changes seem to work, at least for my Python and C++ test cases.  As a side note, all but one of the differences between KlausiD's Notepad_plus.cpp and the 7.4.2 version were in the 7.5.4 version.  I didn't look at any other versions besides 7.4.2 and 7.5.4.\nWhat's the best way to proceed?  I've attached my little dev environment.\ndiv2Files.zip\n. Is there anything else I can do to help? I would love to see this functionality rolled into the project. \nI'm not sure what the formal process is, but I did comment each new line or block with \"NEW\" to make review easier.\nAs for testing, I don't use all (or most) of NPP's features, but I did drop the new executable into the installation directory of each of my machines, so whenever I use NPP, I am testing these changes.. @MAPJe71 - Thanks, Menno.\n@KlausiD - K, did you ever create a PR for this? If not, then that's the next step.  If for some reason you want me to do it, I'm happy to do so.  Let's get your functionality into NPP!. @KlausiD - Will do. Haven't done this before, but we'll give it the old college try!\n@MAPJe71 - Menno, can I be assigned to this issue?. Okay, not the cleanest PR, but it's my first and hopefully will get the job done.. @KlausiD - PR has build errors with x64.  x32 builds fine.  Can you have a look?. @KlausiD - Never mind. Think I figured it out.... @KlausiD - The changes built successfully in the GitHub system under x86 and x64. Nothing to do now but wait and see what happens. Thanks for the code and the chance to get involved!. This seems to be related to the default theme settings in stylers.model.xml. \nIn almost all the other themes (except maybe for \"Solarized-light,\" which uses the same exact \"problematic\" background color), there is no issue seeing the selected function name when the Function List pane does not have focus. So, changing the selected theme via \"Settings / Style Configurator...\" is a workaround.... The other themes look better, not because they change this strange color, but rather they all choose pane background colors that have better contrast with the unchanging field background color, which I guess is inherited from the OS, as I don't see anyway to find it or change it. At least not yet. . So this color is inherited from the Windows theme. Changing the Windows theme can make the unfocused function selection more visible. On Win 10, there's no easy way to change this setting. A quick look into editing the Win 10 registry was unsuccessful.\nIt's not ideal as it is now, but it's usable. If unable to view the selected function name while the function list pane is not selected, the user can always click on the Function List title bar to restore focus to the Function List pane and view the selected function.\nAlso, the user can improve selected function name visibility either through changing the NPP theme or the Windows theme.\nTo fix this programmatically, the user would need the ability to override the system theme settings, at least for this one application of 3D Objects in the Function List pane and any other panes which exhibit similar trouble.. But maybe a good workaround is as simple as changing the style assigned to those function list names to a style which does not use the system 3D Objects background color.. Now that you mention the ability to drag, I tried it, and it achieves the \"Move\". I also tried holding down the Ctrl key while dragging and get a \"Copy\" instead of a Move. So, I agree that the existing functionality is sufficient. My apologies for not testing more before making the request.. @dail8859 - I totally agree. It's my first PR and hasn't been the smoothest process. I don't see how to squash the multiple commits into a single one. According to the GH docs, it looks like I should be able to change the settings of my fork to allow squashing, but I can't find how to do that. If you don't mind giving me some direction, I'm happy to do the squash myself. I would have liked to make the PR a single commit, but clearly I didn't do it the best way.. I've been working outside of Git, so it might be more expedient for you to do it, at least this time. \nI just installed Git and GitDesktop, configured my user.name and user.email, downloaded my fork (which didn't have any changes in it), overlaid the changes, built them (x86 and x64), and then Git committed the changes locally with:\n    src> git commit -a\nI ran:\n    src>git rebase -i HEAD~7\nreceived a list of 7 \"picks\", selected mine, and deleted the others, and it seemed to take.\nWhen I tried:\n    src>git push origin GaryBloom-patch1-Issue715 --force\nI got the following error messages:\n    error: src refspec GaryBloom-patch1-Issue715 does not match any.\n    error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/GaryBloom/notepad-plus-plus.git'\nI'm guessing there's some disconnect between my local env and what's on the GH site.  Probably because I never did a \"pull\" before the \"push\".\nSo, I just went to my GitHub\\notepad-plus-plus dir and did a \n    plus> git pull\nwhich brought\n    8 files changed, 53 insertions(+), 37 deletions(-)\nbut still won't let me execute the push.\nI think at this point it makes more sense for you to do the squash, if you don't mind. I'm not sure when I'll have more time to work on this, and it would be great to see this get into the next release.\nThanks,\nGary. My apologies for disappearing.  I will try to make time to get this resolved.  Not knowing Git is my main obstacle, but I am watching some videos and hope to be able to finish this up in the next week or so.. @donho  - Don, thanks for your patience. I learned enough of Git to \"git\" this done.  Git shouldn't be as much of an obstacle moving forward.\nPlease note that, as per your requests, two of the five committed files (Notepad_plus.{h,cpp}) are back in pre-PR form.  I looked at undoing the last squashed commit to only commit the three changed files, but I thought it best to not risk breaking anything, since I'm still pretty new to Git. So I recommitted the two original files in lieu of repairing the squashed commit. Just wanted to point that out.\nThanks, again.\nGary. Agreed. Implemented. Thanks!. Oops...

    "johnnytemp": "Hi, actually you can Ctrl-/ then Ctrl-Delete, in order to delete only spaces to the left.  (Remark: Ctrl-/ is Scintilla Commands SCI_WORDPARTLEFT)\nCtrl-Backspace to delete both spaces and last word may still have it use, e.g. typing a paragraph and want to delete several last typed words.  Thus, changing an old behavior may not suit the others.\n. Yes, many editors Ctrl-Backspace & Ctrl-Delete do not remove both word and whitespace at a time.  But I think both approachs (delete both word and whitespace at a time, or not) are valid and useful behaviors.\nFor those who desire to delete smaller parts backward, like the multiple whitespaces in the example, I suggest Recording a macro, with two actions: Ctrl-Shift-/, then Backspace, and assign it with Shortcut Alt-Backspace.  :)\n. Oh, h-h-h-h, I overlooked one of your point.  It is that \"abc \" become \"\", instead of become \"abc\", after a Ctrl-Backspace.  To me, its a bit strange behavior since it treat one & more than one whitespaces differently (but perfectly \"smart\" and ok, as in Sublime Text).  However, I just care at how to fine tune to delete only the many whitespaces case at one time only.  Thanks.  :)\n. As a conclusion, if adopting the mentioned behavior of Ctrl+Backspace, then the behavior of Ctrl+Delete, Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right also need to be changed consistently.  I think the change is too big and is against Scintilla's default.  Moreover, changing such behavior(s) could make some previously written PythonScript breaks.\n. In my opinion, better use Macro recording, or write your own PythonScript for such behavior fine tune.  Thank you for listening.\n. Remark: This test case will crash Notepad++\n. I really think Backspace Unindent should be the default behavior, because unindenting some auto-indentation contributes ~90% of the use case of \"Backspace\" purpose at the leading spaces area, in most programming languages.\nIf one need some non-tab-stop-aligned leading spaces, the user just either need to type a few space-bar keys to achieve, or press Shift + some Left arrows then \"Delete/Backspace\".  This is only ~10% of the use cases. (And usual tab-width is limited to 2 or 4, so the the typing to align a non-tab-stop-aligned leading spaces is usually small)\nFurthermore, if it still seems necessary, the program can provide an option to uncheck default \"Backspace Unindent\".\nThank you for your reading.\n. No one can reproduce?\n. Hi, I found the reason.  Version 6.9.1 only crashes if the HexEditor.dll plugin is installed in Notepad++'s \"plugins\" directory.  You could have a try.\n.

I'm writing a launcher for notepad++ (just wraps ExecInExplorer from Microsoft) because of the dll signature verification errors I get with a hard link. I was trying to diagnose why the command line was different from what I passed but then I realized it's just notepad++ modifying the command line passed to it. So one concrete example: sysinternals process explorer.. DSpellCheck has some problem still, even built from master I'm able to reproduce deadlocks by repeatedly opening and closing Notepad++. I'd hold off on enabling it by default. Refer to https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/issues/92\n. Thanks. I tried just now and can reproduce <50% of the time using CTRL+TAB (no drag-and-drop), which is probably how it happens since I use that occasionally to switch tabs.. Thanks! I tested this in Windows 8.1 today and it looks like you fixed it.. Well I was way off, it was a different thread. I had a chance to look at this today and traced it to plugin DSpellCheck, which is a known issue. I am able to reproduce by repeatedly opening and closing Notepad++. I upgraded the DSpellCheck plugin to 1.2.14.2 but I still could reproduce hang on exit. I built from DSpellCheck master which includes another fix but still can reproduce hang on exit.\nIt looks like what's happening is the plugin has a worker thread doing SendMessage to main thread windows at various places and so when Notepad++ sends NPPN_SHUTDOWN in the main thread and then the plugin in the main thread waits for the other threads to close at the same time those threads can be waiting for SendMessage to process so deadlock.

Blinking must be optional.. @donho , first of all, thank you very much for a great product, N++ rocks, it's an everyday can't-do-without tool!\nImho this issue has been closed prematurely, and there are a number of duplicates and variations of the same issue.\nThe setting \"Update silently\" might reduce the number of prompts depending on scenario, but it doesn't solve the main problem of this issue that for all dirtied files, we are still getting one app-modal prompt per file, which is annoying and error-prone, and focus is hijacked by the last updated file, also annoying.\nLooking at the cluster of related issues below, I think this would deserve some developer attention. Any improvement will be appreciated.\n\n\n3320 Rework multiple reload prompts into one (same as this issue #2082)\n\n\n848 Implement Reload All Files Button on Reload Prompt\n\n\n3349 Don't open multiple reload prompts for same file\n\n\n3160 Don't focus last reloaded file (also very irritating, e.g when you're coming from opening another file, then reload prompts divert you to an unrelated file)\n\n\n1087 (same as #3160)\n\n\n3599 (same as #3160)\n\n\n3138 Display multiple modal reload prompts as a non-modal notification bar in each file tab instead (that looks like a very nice idea, but maybe tab-modal and app-modal prompt should still be optionally available for added safety/ error-prevention/convenience)\n\n\n745 app-modal reload or file gone prompt prevents dropping files (solutions e.g. #3138 non-modal per-tab notification bar, or tab-modal alert but that's just partial solution, I guess you really need to allow drop action to finish before showing any modal alerts)\n\n\n1481 Per-file toggle of reload auto-detection (per file opt-out for reload prompt)\n\n\n1564 Highlight externally updated tabs and show prompt only when tab is focused (But please make \"blinking tab\" optional, that can create a more annoying horror of having to click on every tab to get rid of blinking tabs)\n\n\n3333 Cancelling Save-As dialogue triggers reload prompts for other files\n\n\n2186 Option to monitor a file when reload is detected\n\n\n1653 Add an event to allow plugins to detect reloading/reloaded\n\n\n2405 Files opened from a subst drive continually show \"file changed\" dialog\n\n\nAnd finally, \"File gone\" prompts seem to suffer from the same design problems:\n1116 Dozens of \"File doesn't exist\" warnings prevent closing window (even with Update Silently enabled) and shown incorrectly with Network Share. This is one of the most remarkable annoying issues of Notepad++.\nWorse, even for the same file you can get multiple prompts: issue 3349.\nA fix would be much appreciated.\nIt's also very error-prone:\n- The screen coordinates of the Yes button change according to file name length. Fast-clicking in the same spot user can easily end up clicking NO unintendedly for some of multiple alerted files.\n- Same for repetitively pressing Enter to confirm the alerts: Your last Enter key presses can easily end up at a random position in a random document and unintendedly change content there..

    "Krzysiu": "There's still a big problem, but I'd need to have more time. Both \"Bookmarks\" and \"Tabs\" have same translation - \"zak\u0142adki\".\n. Excuse me for talking here, as I don't know German. I already feel stupid. I don't want to learn you, I want to share my experiences in the moment of the big change and important discussion. I often translate webapps or standalone apps and I want to say a few things. Sorry if things I say are obvious. And sorry about my English. I'm EN>PL translator, not PL>EN for the sake of recipients ;) \nAt first, please keep in mind that many translators do their work, because they think that language knowledge means translating ability. That's of course false. That's why I don't think that other apps should be an example.\nAlso most translations are made by IT guys who are used to English grammar, English typography, English words etc. That makes their translation biased and americanized (Englishized? ;)). \nLanguage rules were mostly created long time ago. With world going faster and faster, language also is changing, so there's a chance that some construction is already allowed. That's why I recommend to check language rules every time there are some doubts. Relying on our knowledge is not always good because our teacher could be wrong, language rules may have some additional exception in digital world (sometimes exceptions allowed only in digital usage).\nDo you have some \"language support\" in your country? In Poland most universities have webpages where you can ask question and experts will reply. Remember that some rules are already widely used (language usus), but not codified yet - like local forms of \"Googling\" are widely used worldwide, but they are normalized in just a few dictionaries, like English. It's also a nice thing to decide and answer clearly - \"does my translation prefers usus or codex?\".\nMy protip: experts could be conservative or liberal. If conservative expert will give you liberal answer (and vice-versa), then it's probably the best opinion :)\nThat's a bunch of my tips, but I want to get to my point. Ellipsis without space before it could be americanized version of German grammar. If experts say it's still wrong to ommit that space, then remember - if you'd ommit it then it will be reason for another translators to ignore space in their translations. You can end this loop by using correct German, not one of translator who was inspired by translators who got used to bad translations.\nI think it could make you proud - most tools have bad translation, but look, I actually care about correctness! Even app like N++ can change language awareness of people and it could learn people what's the correct version. \nAlso thanks for caring about such \"small thing\". Polish translators of many many apps doesn't seem to care about anything. \nGood luck, neighbors!\n. > Thanks for your statement! I read it as an encouragement for decoupling a little bit from the praxis in Windows programs, and somehow as a pro-vote for spaces before ellipses.\nIf that's correct, then yes! :) I understand very well why people don't use spaces before ellipses - it's just rare worldwide. But that's German and German rules are most important.\nOne tip more. It applies to Polish, but maybe you have something like that in Germany. It applies e.g. for hyphens, dashes and all things that I see just as \"minus\" ;) Rules about \"minuses\" are rather minor and experts allows to ommit them if there's a technical problem. So if you are writting in LibreOffice using straight \"-\" - it's wrong. When you do it on typewriter - it's not a language error in any way.\nBut both in Polish and English some \"meta-rule\" have a high priority. If there are technical difficulties in one part of the work, it's better to keep it the same in whole work. \nSo maybe there's something like that in German. I see lack of space in some parts of Notepad++ as a reason to ignore some minor rules and that wouldn't be an error. But if such step would be taken, maybe it would be better to ignore that rule in the whole tool.\nSorry, I won't give tips anymore, as I see that I have to many \"maybe\" and I shouldn't talk about things that I can say only by comparison with other languages :) I'm afraid it looks like \"some Pole\" teaches you about your language. If my tips would be useful... But I'm afraid I'm just taking your time. Tschuss Damen und Herren! :)\n. > To be honest, I didn't understand anything of your last post\n\nThat would be my sleep deprivation.\ntl;dr sometimes technical limits could force you to disobey language rules, yet it will be correct text, as it's \"not your fault\"; if you choose one version of rule or you decide to disobey it (like minus instead hyphen), you should stick to it through your whole project\nMoreover, you write texts that are too long for my taste\nI think that's not a matter of taste - my long posts are my big disadvantage and I know that less people will read it because its length and problems with sticking to the topic, even my own. Sorry again!\n. Read the title, please. Thanks for the tip, I'll ask there.\n. \n",

If so, drop both of them. \nYou could amend the regular expression currently in place as follows (simply prepend (?)\n(?[A-Za-z]+://[A-Za-z0-9_\\-\\+\u02dc.:?&@=/%#,;\\{\\}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\|\\\\!\\\\]+\nto have it see any potential leading (.\nHTH.. @sasumner @PopeSpaceous \n\nJust let me know if PR #5108 works for your use cases.

It includes the feature that the URL style is removed from a range if the URL shortened (e.g. add a ) after o in (http://abc.com))\nIn terms of performance I am not sure if scintilla cashes regular expressions, since otherwise compiling a regexp with every call with the same regexp would be redundant and time consuming.\nEveryone welcome to test!. @PopeSpaceous Thanks for testing!\n\nAll the links have died and are not clickable.

    "naiveknave": "Thanks for responding. One of the first things I tried was exactly as you said. I had tried that with version 6.8.1. Just now I installed 6.8.3 and tried all of that again - the problem persists.\nAgain, macros that are recorded with find/replace commands work just fine on their own. The problem begins when I try to use one of these while recording a new macro. All commands embedded in a macro I use while recording automatically get put into the new macro's command list - except the ones that involve find/replace.\nIn fact, when I record a macro that consists only of find/replace commands (call it X), then invoke it one or more times while recording a new macro (call it Y) - and do nothing else except invoke X - by the time I have stopped recording and wish to save Y, I don't have that option. It's as if I had clicked 'record', then clicked 'stop recording' immediately without doing anything. If, however, X contains other commands (e.g. 'move-left'), I can save Y after only invoking X during recording. When I do this though, only X's non-find/replace commands get copied in - it's as if I had skipped the find/replace commands entirely.\nPlease try to reproduce this and let me know if you can.\nEDIT: Just noticed your reference in #992. Anyone else reading this, please try to reproduce these so we can know whether it's our individual systems or n++.\n. I've updated to 6.8.3 and my original problem is still the same.

It's come up yet again in the forums.  \nAt one point last month, I tried using the windows API from an external process to try to kill the Notepad++ instance, and see if I could reliably replicate the issue, but I couldn't get it to trigger; apparently, even killing the process externally is too \"clean\" of an exit.\nToday, I began to think that maybe there was a way to force a Windows Blue Screen Of Death while running NPP, and see if it could replicate the problem -- my thought was in a Virtual Machine, to protect any actual hardware.  \nI found this MS TechNet post which explains how to initiate a BSOD.  It has a disclaimer, \"you cannot manually initiate a Stop error on a virtual machine that has virtual machine extensions installed\", but that implies that a VM without extensions installed should be able to be forced to BSOD.\nI don't have a VM (or a physical machine that I could risk), nor do I have the windows-app debugging skill necessary to figure out what's going wrong, even if I could replicate the problem reliably... but I thought I'd share the idea, in case someone else has the right tools and skillset.\n[posted a nearly verbatim copy in the Community Forums thread mentioned above]\nupdate: Scott Sumner in the forums had apparently tried to force a BSOD some time ago, and was not able replicate this issue that way.  So I don't know if he was just unlucky, or whether this is not a viable debug angle. :-(. Please see this NPP Community forum discussion: the evidence is starting to point to it either being the installer's shortcut, or Win10 auto-pinning the installer's initial call to \"notepad++.exe change.log\".  If it were the user manually pinning the shortcut, it would make sense to ask the user to fix the shortcut.  But if it\u2019s the installer that\u2019s creating the bad shortcut, the long-term fix needs to be on the installer side.  And even if it\u2019s Win10 that\u2019s creating an additional \u201cpin\u201d (probably in the \u201crecently added\u201d or \u201crecently used\u201d or \u201cfrequently used\u201d section) that includes the change.log \u2013 it might be helpful to see if there\u2019s a way during install to convince Win10 to auto-pin the correct version of the shortcut rather than the change.log shortcut.  It seems rather inconvenient (dare I say \u201crude\u201d) to ask every Win10 NPP x64 user to manually fix auto-generated shortcuts when the evidence is pointing to it being either the installer directly, or Win10\u2019s auto-pin behavior, that\u2019s causing the \u201cbad\u201d shortcut, and not anything the user has control over.\nAs a thought for fixing it if it\u2019s a Win10 auto-pin issue: I am assuming it\u2019s when the installer auto-opens NPP with change.log that\u2019s creating the incorrect auto-pin. I\u2019ve never written an installer, but could the installer be made to open a \u201craw\u201d copy of NPP first, then send a message to NPP to additionally open change.log \u2013 that way, the instantiation-command wouldn\u2019t include change.log, so the Win10 auto-pin won\u2019t include it either. I don\u2019t know if that would work, but it makes sense to me..

Thanks for your response @MAPJe71\nNow the question is why this does not happen with .c files (C language) and it does with Java files? I mean, editing a C language file you don't need a final newline or whitespace.\nFor example this:\n```\nvoid myFunction1 (int num)\n{\n}\nvoid myFunction2 (int num)\n{\n}\n```\nOr this (with {} wrapping it):\n```\n{\nvoid myFunction1 (int num)\n{\n}\nvoid myFunction2 (int num)\n{\n}\n}\n```\nwill take perfectly the functions. So, why it does not work with Java files as the same manner as in C files?\n. @MAPJe71 is there some hope someday this will be fixed? I usually open read only files (i cannot append characters on it) in a Windows network and they don't have a final new line so the function list is never shown.\nTHANKS!. Still does not work in last version of Notepad++ (7.5.8). Yes, please, i try them if you tell me how to apply them to Notepad++.\nThanks. I pasted that to my functionList.xml and it worked, functions are listed correctly (although my code is not too big), thanks! But i don't understand what you told me about that one of the two VB parsers is commented, i see both codes without comments, i only see in comments an URL and a short explanation the \\K.\nSo will you add this VB parser to Notepad++?. One note, this bug does not happen with Java files:\n```Java\npublic class MyClass\n{\n    public static void myFunc1()\n    {\n        myFunc2 ('/*.js'); // The slash followed by an asterisk in the string makes Notepad++ not showing function list\n    }\npublic static myFunc2 (String name)\n{\n    return name;\n}\n\n/* This block comment with the string in myFunc1 makes Notepad++ not showing Function list */\n\n}\n```\nso maybe the problem is in the PHP parsing template?.

But I think you have to install the SDK for W7 to get them - but not tested. W8 and W10 SDK (offered in the Build Tools installer) did nothing.\nTo compile it, run the Visual C++ 2015 x86 Native Build Tools Command Prompt from the Start menu, go to the PowerEditor\\visual.net folder and execute: msbuild notepadPlus.vcxproj /p:configuration=\"unicode release\" /p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=\"false\"\nDownload the official master and replace the file. \nIf you never used VS before, after loading the project at the top choose Unicode Release and x86 (this is the 32bit version (npp website says 64bit might have problems with plugins). Then go to \"Debugging\" -> \"Settings for Notepad++\" -> \"C/C++\" and in the right window choose to not treat warnings as errors (/WX-). Then you can compile it.

This annoys me to the hell! And I wonder why donho is adding some purely cosmetic changes when there exists an issue like this one which makes NP++ barely usable a times.\n. Yes, I'd be glad to test this!\n. It's weird, but it does not work for me. I tried following settings for \"File Status Auto-Detection\":\n1. Only \"Enabled\" is checked\n2. \"Enabled\" and \"Update silently\" is checked\nOpened a file X, made it inactive in NP++ (i.e. made another file the current), changed X in another program, switched back to NP++, made X current file -- and nothing happens. No prompt, no file update.\n. Tried it with your settings, still no effect.\n. I double checked, and still no success. Could it be bacause I still use WIn XP SP3?\nOn the original 6.9 version, I get the prompt if I just check \"Enable\". On the patched version, I don't get the prompt. But the tabs is not highlighted if I check \"Highlight tab\".\n. Hello Bernhard,\nI really appreciate your efforts! Thank you!\nI immediately installed a fresh copy of NP++ (6.9.1) and then overwrote two files (notepad++.exe, SciLexer.dll) with the ones from your archive (I didn't copy NppShell.dll since it is not present in the official .7z distribution of NP++).\nI'm sorry to say that it still does not work.\nCould you maybe provide a version that would write some data to some log file which would indicate\n1. Whether the correct mode is really active (and not just the check box checked)\n2. Whether the fact that the file has changed has been detected. It might be that the file change has been detected but the the GUI does nothing.\nMaybe we could track down the problem this way.\nThank you again for your efforts!\n. I'm curious whether @donho is aware of this (and the similar) ticket. Some much less important changes (IMO of course) get committed (like auto typing cool wisdoms) but this issue (which directly affects productivity) does not get attention.. The language menu is nested, so a check mark would not be visible if the menu is opened. A better place would be the status line IMO. It could also be used as a language switcher (double click on it -- and a language selection menu appears).\n. This issue is probably related to #3570.. Yes, this is better now but still not quite well. If the cursor is at the end of the file in an empty line (i.e. the last text line has a CR at the end), then, after switching the tab to another file and back, the cursor is still o the right line, but it is barely visible. The file got scrolled one line up.\nThe file has 2792 lines, the last one is empty.. Sorry, I can't post screenshots with the old version of NP++ since I already deleted it. But I can post some imags with NP++ 7.5.9 (the latest version as of now).\nBefore I do that, I must say that I can't reproduce the behaviour with an arbitrary file. It shows so far on one particular file only (but is reproducible with it).\nAlso, after some experiments, I don't think it has to do with tab switching but rather just with cursor navigation within a file. I.e. I don't have to switch tabs in order to reproduce the behaviour (this might mean that it should be a subject for a new issue).\nAnyway, here are the images:\n\nAfter pressing Ctrl+Home, the cursor is at the top left position -- as axpected:\n\n\n\nAfter pressing Ctrl+End, the cusrsor is on the last line, but it is not fully visible, only some top pixels of it (see the red frame, made by me):\n\n\n\nAfter pressing Ctrl+Home again, the last line is fully visible:\n\n\n. This might be a duplicate of #1087 (Do not switch tab on file modification).. This might be related to #3570.. This would be a nice feature, yes, but there are tools to perform this task, e.g. unix utilities ported to windows. Also, there is Python plugin which would easily allow to implement this feature.\nShould we make every useful function part of NP++ core? Wouldn't it explore the program?. I can confirm this with NP++ v. 7.5.1 (official download) on Win XP.. Yes, I must correct myself. I updated the title and the description.. > He chooses when to update Notepad++ with a new Scintilla version, and apparently hasn't felt the need to do so in a number of years--nothing to be done for it.\nFork? ;-). I'd rather agree with @ArthurFabian. The save button should do nothing if the window contents is in sync with the disc. Note that it's not the same as \"nothing has been changed in the window\": Just after creating a new file, there are no changes in the window, but this state is still not present on the disc, hence no sync, hence the Save button should bring up the Save dialog.\nI undestand that it's not a proof, but MS Word and Wordpad work exactly like this.\nA possible usage scenario would be to create (prepare) some files and give them meaningful names, and then start entering text to them.\nThis issue can be \"solved\" easily as @sasumner wrote, there are more serious inconveniences in NP++ IMO.. setDirty(true)?.

Additionally I removed an introduced flickering of the tab headers.\nI uploaded a new binary https://nges.at/notepad/npp_hberni_20160407_01.7z\n. @germanTHX I will consider removing the blinking, or make it optional via the settings dialog - but it will take some time, since I am really busy at the moment. Anyway thanks for feedback, I didn't expect that my code will still work on recent versions. Good to know.\n@jnm2 I do not expect an official solution, since notepad++ includes \"Log Monitoring\" since 6.9.2. I didn't try that feature yet, so I am unable to say, which approach is more suitable. But I think that my approach suits me more when working with source and trace files mixed in one notepad++ window.. I uploaded a new binary to https://nges.at/notepad/npp_hberni_20180320_01.7z\nIt's a fast and almost untested port of my patches to the official 7.5.6 npp.\nBy the way I removed the blinking, since it was more annoying than useful.. @micktion I can't tell you. I would be pleased to see them in the official build as well.. I am sorry to say, that I am not aware how to increase visibility.\nI would be pleased if @donho could contribute his opinion and his expertise on how we could manage to make it into an official release.. messed it up\n. Not exactly like your proposal but have a look at #1564 and #1087. All my colleges like notepad++ much, but had been annoyed by the \"update dialog\" when working with trace and source files concurrently. This forced me to dig into compiling my version. I posted a pull request, which is, afaik, the proposed way to get features into the official build. My changes are not very big and I would be very pleased to see them included, but I don't know how to push on this.. ",
    "jnm2": "+1. This is my biggest irritation with Notepad++.\nThe main scenario that I want to see fixed is when Notepad++ is not focused and I click a specific tab that I want to switch to, but when I click to switch to a different tab, the window gets focus and the initially focused tab (whose file changed) asks if I want to reload. Then no matter what I answer, the initial tab stays focused instead of the tab I clicked on.\nI love the concept of still checking all tabs for changes but only flashing a highlight rather than switching tabs. Please add to that allowing switching tabs without interruption when the window is not focused even when the current tab has changes.\n. To be clear, I want the active tab to show me the message when the window\ngets focus except for those times when the window gets focus by me clicking\non a different tab.

Without it, there is no reason to use Notepad++ any longer instead of just Visual Studio Code. \nIts also very confusing to see it disappear without notice (other than possible in the release notes always shown after install which always close since otherwise never anything critical there). \nI was about to uninstall and revert to old version assuming was a bug, as many others are likely to do. \nAnd others, even if don't assume is a bug, may revert to older version and stop updating Notepad++ in order to keep Plugin Manager, especially if no easy way to install it.\n. Can you at very least show a menu entry for Plug-in Manager (next to where is usually shown) which, when clicked, shows explanation that is missing now, why, and provides a link to download it.\nAlso, can you at least include option installer to install plugin manager? \nIf its a licensing issue with bundling it, then you may be able to do something like PotPlayer with OpenCodecs, where it downloads installer for you to make it easy for you to \"install yourself\".\nOr, you could even just open browser to Plugin Manager download page if user checks Plugin Manager install option..

Then, when I execute the source code in the window of the other program, it often happens that I've forgot to save\none of the modified files beforehand. A noticeable highlighting would remind me not to forget saving and also would give me a save feeling that I actually have saved all my files (it is sometimes a little tiresome to look at the asterisk in the title bar).\n\nAnyway, Notepad++ already helps me a lot!

Also, the pork2sausage file that it says isn't there is in fact there.\n. Okay I found the problem and I know this is months later but I bet you guys were also running Notepad++ from the shared drives. The problem is the installation of Notepad++ being ran from a network location doesn't have permission to edit files on drives other than it's own (except on the PC it's running on).\nFor example, on your desktop, PC 1, you have multiple shared drives: oldstuff (C) and newstuff (D). NPP is installed on oldstuff. There are files on D that you want to edit. You want to edit those files in your kitchen using your laptop, PC 2. You have oldstuff mounted on letter D and newstuff on letter E on PC 2. You try to run NPP (installed on oldstuff) to edit a file on the newstuff drive, but get the \"drive doesn't exist\" error (the problem described in this issue). This happens because Windows on PC 2 never asks if you want to allow NPP to have access to local or remote servers as it did when first installing NPP on PC 1. Go to Windows Firewall on PC 2, add an entry for NPP and allow NPP to edit home files.\nEDIT: I typed WAY more than I planned before giving a complete rundown.... ",

    "frank-orellana": "TL;DR: Don't merge any files. Just backup and replace the %appdata%\\langs.xml file on every installation.\nHi I've had some of this issues and I noticed something.\nAlmost everything that I customize goes either to the stylers.xml, userDefineLang.xml or the config.xml files. BUT the source of all my troubles and the bugs I've seen reported are because of just the langs.xml file.\nI've searched but i couldn't find a way to modify that file from the options and the only times I've updated it manually it has been to correct the problems of it not being in sync with the langs.model.xml file.\nIf i want a new keyword, new file extension or change to some style of any lang, I change it from the Settings -> Style Configurator... and that menu updates stylers.xml instead!, so I can't think of a reason for having that file unless the user really can't do what he wants in the stylers.xml and he really knows what he is doing. \nThe only time I can think of we would need this file would be to make very fine modifications to a language (add keywords of different types NOT accessible from the menu for example)but that has not happened to me yet, maybe changing comment char, but that could be added to the menu in my opinion.\nI don't remember having needed that file, even when I customize Npp a lot and use a lot of custom languages and make additions to the existing ones.\nEven if some user prefers to update manually this file instead of the stylers.xml, he will lose all the new stuff of every new installation. He should update stylers.xml instead, or know he has to backup the file before any new installation, compare it against the new file and merge changes manually (the compare plugin can be easily used in these cases). As It was said, merging automatically is not trivial and maybe it will be made in the future only if it is really needed.\nA simple backup of this file in the installation would allow users to have the new stuff, and merge their changes if the new version does not already provide them! A warning or question in the installer would prevent any new issues being raised like \"I lost my weird changes after installing\". Even more, after the new installation is complete, both the backup, if exists, and new langs.xml file could be opened so the user can try to merge changes if any (I would say this is an overkill but it might help some of the users).\nAlso if the old langs.xml is identical to the langs.model.xml then even a backup should not be needed.\nIf I delete or rename the file, it is created again with a fresh copy of langs.model.xml (And I did not loose any of my custom settings since they were in the other files, and I sure don't miss it).\nStylers.xml is much better for changing the languages because it only has what is changed by the user. We can even improve it later if needed and maybe even get rid of the langs.xml file.\nSo in short:\n\n%appdata%\\langs.xml is the source of a lot of problems\nUser settings are not stored in that file (even custom keywords and stuff)\n%appdata%\\langs.xml can be backed up on installation (if different from langs.model.xml)\nA simple backup could allow users to get all the new stuff and merge their changes if they want\n%appdata%\\stylers.xml can be improved in the future to avoid needing this file.\n\nThese are some of the open issues that are affected by not updating this file (much more closed):\n2455, #3072 , #780, #3063, #1813, #555, #661,#2640, #1848, etc.... In effect it is one of the changes mentioned by @vlakoff  in 5d438aa.\nspecifically this one:\n- Changed use of L_JS (19) to L_JAVASCRIPT (58).\nIf I change the langID in the XML back to 19 from 58 then I see the js functions again!\nBUT... I also had to apply vlakoff changes made in this one: https://github.com/vlakoff/notepad-plus-plus/commit/ea51d5db6152ca22bf139dd67d5848a59806e4e1#diff-e804f743afae131d23e8eecb1feeb84a  to make them appear correctly. (Not sure why this is not in the master branch already)\nSo in the end my functionList.xml looks like this: https://github.com/frank-orellana/notepad-plus-plus/commit/1a615dfab69bdc7e222c609a2f51dbd48d4f8947#diff-e804f743afae131d23e8eecb1feeb84a  and it works again!\nI'm not sure if I should make a pull request with these changes since I don't know why the langID was changed from 19 to 58, but for now this make the function list work again for javascript. This was made on a fresh install.\nAnd btw. Java function list are not working for me either. Maybe we should go back to some older version of this file in case it was ruined by some commit??\n. This was already covered in #3031, please check that out and some other corrections to the spanish translations to see if there is anything else missing. No problem, and actually you can help if you want, download the modified file from here and replace your nativeLang.xml file (probably in your %appdata%\\notepad++ folder) and test it. Hopefully this changes will be available for the next version.\nThere are a lot of fixes to the translation, specially in the settings.. There are some features I have noticed that make notepad++ slow with big files (even simple text files). Those are Auto-completion and clickable hyperlinks. There might be other features that make them slow too  (autodetect character encoding and smart highlighting maybe).\nOther than that, it could also be the plugins you have installed. Anything that analyzes the text is a suspect (DSpellcheck for example).\nAlso I've noticed that the first time I open a big file it might take a while, after that it opens quickly. Not sure if that is a bug of windows memory allocation or Npp (or even my own computer).\nCan you try to see if you have some of those features/plugins enabled and test with them turned off to see if they are the ones needing improvement? You can also share the debug info from the help menu.. Maybe you should uncheck the Regular Expression checkbox. That's the only way I could reproduce your problem. You should check either Normal or Extended, that way the replacement is correct.\n\n. I found this on the line 1388 of file PowerEditor/src/ScitillaComponent/Buffer.cpp\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/acb30b9e610bd5ff759318de0fca63116196c96e/PowerEditor/src/NppIO.cpp#L1386-L1390\nI guess this line has to be deleted or at least add the condition to check if File Status Auto-Detection is enabled:\nif (nppgui._fileAutoDetection != cdDisabled)\n    checkModifiedDocument();\n\nI also find this behavior annoying and I think deleting the line would be the best option. \nThis is also a dup of #2776 so this little change would close them both.\n@donho what do you think? should I delete the line and submit the PR?\n. Don't have that issue over here:\n\nWhat version are you using? if it is the latest maybe deleting NativeLang in %APPDATA% would help (or maybe just change the language in preferences and then revert to spanish). Actually when I do that something else happens: it does not works at all in some editors, at least in google docs. The work around keeps working. Also if I just copy the HTML format, it will paste into it but without formatting.. I would like to agree on that, but the fact that when I copy something from word to them it works makes me wonder that the functionality could be improved directly from Npp by adding more formats when copying to clipboard.. So, I tried to investigate where is this happening but haven't had much luck.\nAlthough I found this, I think this code is fired when switching to a tab:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/647651b7eed7b6349f2f4f98639e9517f0c189e5/PowerEditor/src/Notepad_plus.cpp#L3725-L3728\nFrom what I can tell, if that reload flag is set, then it will reload the file, so maybe that is what happens, instead of just checking the file existence it reloads the entire file every time?\nI tried to track to where the flag is set but only found it here on line 450, which doesn't makes much sense to the problem (at least to me):\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/acb30b9e610bd5ff759318de0fca63116196c96e/PowerEditor/src/NppIO.cpp#L449-L451\nAny ideas?. I see, I did not have time to fully read your reply until now. The way I understand, it checks for the file existence to correctly activate or deactivate some menus. \nIf that's the case then I would say that a new feature would be needed to disable this checking, which would cause the menus to always be enabled but thay should be just a minor inconvenience compared to the times I have to wait 12 seconds when switching among each file.. I do not understand the \"And if you've opened a file and after code execution comes to the file existence logic\" comment.\nAs for the menus, the problem would be, for example, that the delete file would always be enabled when you check this option, even when the file was deleted outside notepad++, this should be just a minor inconvenience, since if you click that option and the file is already deleted nothing should happen, and would only happen IF you check the new option.\nThe files opened are stored in memory and in the backup folders anyway in case the file is deleted or modified from the outside. I think Notepad++ already checks if the file is different from the one opened when saving anyway.\n. ",

(In fact in this case, the script doesn't even try to run, whereas without the toolset flag it does make partial progress.) \nSo close, yet so far away. I tried indeed but unfortunately my circumstances seem intent on preventing me from accessing a working instance of VS2013.. I went to the moon and back trying to get it to work without VS2013, including using the NuGet Package as you suggest. Just couldn't make it happen.\nI did finally get the build through, using VS2013 (as I found access to a VM where I could load it). In response to the entire wrestling match I made this. Maybe it could of some help to someone.... Yep! Worked like a charm. I didn't even have to do step 7, as it seems the updates changed those lines for me to the new version.\nI had basically tried doing exactly this, except I didn't add the SciLexer.vcxproj to the notepadPlus.vcxproj but instead tried updating then building it separate. (The more you know I guess, huh?)\nAnyway, these steps should be on page one. Thanks!. I am using the Enterprise edition, so that may explain it.. @ClaudiaFrank \nWhen you performed the steps described above to successfully build using VS2017, did you by chance also have VS2013 installed on the same machine? I know was able to reproduce these steps successfully a few weeks ago, but now I cannot, and I am fairly confident it is because I am now working on a machine that does not have VS2013 installed (when before I was). If this is this case, then it follows of course that even though all steps can be completed with VS2017, VS2013 (with its mscv 12.0 toolset, specifically) is still required ... But again, you have VS2013 installed on your machine, right? I'm fairly sure you need 12.0 for BOOST, whether you use v140 or v141 for the notepad++ build. I was initially thinking your steps above required only VS2017, but it appears this is not the case.\nI bring this up because I was trying to build a document (based on your steps above), but the build (step 9) fails, citing the lack of v120 as the problem. Once I can get another virtual machine and install VS2013 I will confirm.. Did you have to explicitly search for the boost_regex_vc141 package then? By default my VS updates the existing package boost_regex_vc120.... Alrighty then I think I see my confusion. I'll rerun everything and make sure it works as expected. Thanks again!. There simply are no lines with '1.58' anywhere in that file after I do the package upgrades. This is probably because I was upgrading existing packages, whereas you were removing and reinstalling new ones? I think the update process automatically converted the 1.58 to 1.67 in SciLexer.vcxproj.... But now I'm going to go back through from the beginning, and you're right I probably will have to do that, since I too will remove and reinstall rather than upgrade (although I guess I could upgrade boost, and only have to remove and reinstall the regex). Only I think I'll just replace 58 with 67, rather than delete the lines.. Well... my problem all along is that I haven't been able to retarget. \n\nI don't have the option to select v141, as you can see in the screenshot. What it surely comes down to is if I can't successfully retarget, then of course I'll need v120 (i.e. VS2013).... It looks like in your screenshot you are doing a rebuild. The same should apply to build though, right? I would think so... I have v141 and v140 toolsets, but it seems to me the system can't retarget 120 to 140 or 141, and therefore it shows nothing in the selection dropdown.\nJust to reconfirm, you are positive you do not have VS2013 (and therefore toolset 120) installed when you are performing the steps above?. Thank you for all the details. Now indeed I see my misunderstanding, and have just compiled successfully without VS2013, using toolset 141 for both SciLexer and Notepad. \nBig thanks again!. I created a procedural document with screenshots entitled \"Building Notepad++ from Source - A Beginners Guide - OPTION A\" available here , which is based on the steps provided by ClaudiaFrank above. Hope it may help someone down the line. Thanks yet again.. Perhaps this beginner's guide to building notepad++ that I created in response to some similar difficulties could be of some use to you.

This is a HUGE time-saver.  I make single line/char edits 50+ times an hour.  The applications take ~3 to 5 minutes to start/load.  Having to close the application and restart/load it to see the effect/result of a single edit would become  2+ to 8+ HOURS to see the results of those same 50 edits!!!  Disabling this 'feature' would devastate many coders using NP++...\nPerhaps a 'check if open elsewhere and notify via dialog box' via a open handle/thread check against the file, but do not disable this 'feature.'\n. I'm pretty sure that can be handled by the suggestion I made above about the open handle or thread check. There is also an option that exists to make a file read only by right clicking on its tab, but I don't use single instance and I don't know if you actually have tabs in single instance.  It sounds to me as if you want to intentionally create conflict when two or more sources access the file. If that's the case it should most definitely be put in as an optional feature as it would contradict the current functionality which I believe the majority of current users rely on.\nI would consider that enabled by default as breaking the application as it currently is and I would start looking for another editor, and I'm fairly certain that most of my colleagues would as well.  That's only a small group of 100+ out of the large number of users of NP++.

Add a LangType defaultLang = L_TEXT parameter to the function NppParameters::getLangFromExt in order to return the selected defaultLang (If specified, if not specified the default remains L_TEXT) instead of the fixed return L_TEXT. This allow to behave as the comment row // If the ext is not in the list, the defaultLang passed as argument will be set. says for the function Buffer::setFileName and fix its behavior with unknown extensions\n2nd. If you want behave as the \"save\" button also for the \"save as\" I think that I can implement a sort of bool dontReDetectLangIfAlreadySet = flase parameter for the function Buffer::setFileName, that if it is set to true avoids the the change of the _lang var, if it is set to a value different from L_TEXT into the current Buffer object. In this way when the file is saved with \"save as\" the selected language is not changed, but when the file is open or saved with the default L_TEXT value it will be auto-detected as always\nWhen i save a file with \"save as\" that has a language different from \"text\" the language is preserved as in the \"save\" command.\nFor all new or old files that have \"normal text\" default value set as language, the language will be auto detected during the \"save as\" as before but with the plus of use the fallback value that is obtained from the first row content if the file extension is not detected.\nWith this approach if I change the extension or I save a new file with certain extension after the change of language, the user set language prevails on the language detected by extension.\nI've already done the work in my fork and it works, I'm going to check it better and make a PR soon, let me know if is ok or not for you.\nAnother way to do this can be by adding another function to see if the file extension is supported and maintain the current selected language only if new file name has an unknown extension, in case that the new file name has different known extension, the language will be updated using the language associated with the new file extension, changing the previous selected language.\nIf you want to proceed with this new way, please ignore my PR and I'll start from scratch with this new approach.\nLet me know.\n. @donho Yes, I've made the rebase on notepad_plus_plus/master, check if you can merge it now.. @donho please, can you merge it before running another year leaving it unmerged and incrementing the chance that a new rebase may be needed?.

Further testing showed that this was confusion due to not being able to turn on whitespace marking.

Did the default color for whitespace change? https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/1260 suggests that it might be from Scintilla, since it states that not being able to change the color most likely wouldn't be changed unless Scintilla implements it, and it appears that Scintilla recently implemented.

While I wouldn't mind Notepad++ being on the Windows Store, your request reads like ad copy, and saying long-wanted sounds like either it's from a person whose first language is not English who meant the word long-awaited, or someone using a neologism. Notepad updates seamlessly enough for me and so have a lot of programs. Maybe Notepad++ could come to Steam too, for that matter.\n. I'm American, so I have difficulty remembering rhat there are other nations that use some variation of the English languague.\nBut what rock have you crawled out from under?\n\nSteam has been a general software store for quite some time now and they've even added videos for sale or rent.\n. Installation accompanying an OS hardly indicates usage patterns. I do things with Steam all the time, and would look there first for something and before that an internet search.\nWhat you say about the preinstalled state of Windows Store makes about as much sense as saying that since Notepad comes preinstalled, why bother with Notepad++.\nOh, and sometimes I just like to grouse.\n. Oh and you just confused a plurality with a majority.\nWhat is this \"earth\" you mention? If it's not in 'Murica, I'm not interested.\n. I don't vote for reasons I don't care to mention and I can't speak for all of those supportive of Trump, but as I see it, Trump was behaving in a way that showed he understood how much of a farce the debates actually were. Cruz tried to ape Trump, but he only indicated he didn't understand why Trump was behaving the way he was in the first place.\nNow when I made that 'Murica statement, I was juxtapositioning stereotypical American behavior with your statement that expressed the notion that the whole Earth was in agreement with you.\nAlso one way Trump could \"make Mexico pay for the wall\", is to charge all foreigners a border crossing fee, which is not that hard of a scenario to figure out.\n. What We've learned:\nSteam isn't just for games anymore.\nIt might not be a bad idea to put Notepad++ on some web stores.\nBoth treating America as if it's the only place good can be found and taking it for granted that the whole Earth is on your side is bad.\nJust because something is bundled with an OS doesn't mean it gets used very much.\nPluralities are not majorities.\n.

It's not changing when Notepad++ writes the file to disk.\nIf you open the saved file with BabelPad, it looks correct.\nIt's when Notepad++ opens the file containing a single \u00a7 as the first letter when the problem occurs.\nMultiple \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 are treated right.  Even just a pair \u00a7\u00a7 works OK. But not say #\u00a7.\nSaving \u0152################\u00a7 gives the same problem, even though\nsaving \u0152################ works fine.\n. I was looking at your issue part 1 out of mere curiosity.\n\nOpen BabelPad.\nType \u00a7\nSave file (BabelPad only uses UTF-8 encoding)\nOpen the file with Notepad++\n\nIt's nothing to do with how Notepad++ saves a file. My use of BabelPad demonstrates this.\nThis problem is a bit like a funny old issue with earlier editions of Windows Notepad.\nIf you typed this in the first line (without an EOL) and saved the file. when it was re-opened with Notepad, all the characters displayed as Han CJK ideographs.\nBush hid the facts\nSeveral other strings gave the same effect, though they all had to be word length pattern 4 3 3 5\nNotepad++ must use an algorithm to detect what the encoding is when it opens a file.\nYou appear to have discovered something that \"breaks\" the algorithm.\nThe old Notepad algorithm was heuristic. \nNot quite sure what's the precise manner in which the \u00a7 character messes up how Notepad++ determines the file encoding. That's for the programmers to address.. I too can reproduce issue part 2.  I don't think this is an issue. \nIt's what can happen when you try make ANSI do something outwith its scope.\nClue: the UTF-8 byte codes for the section sign is \\xC2\\xA7.\nThe black \\xA7 is merely the second half of it.. Going back to part 1 of your issue.\n\nNew file in Notepad++ with encoding set to UTF-8\nType Alt-0167 to get the section sign\nSave file as text.txt\nOpen file with trusted BabelPad. It displays correctly as \u00a7 and it behaves correctly with BabelPad convert menu.\nClose tab in Notepad++\nReopen file from recent list. It displays incorrectly.\n\nI have no doubt that BabelPad is completely accurate here. \nIt's proved its worth to me over several years of dealing with non-Roman scripts.\nI'm even in contact with its developer.. A hex dump of the saved file (performed using TextPipe) gave:\n00000000  C2 A7. Are you using Notepad++ x64 or x32 ?\nThough I have a 64-bit Win7 PC, I still use Notepad++ x32.. I'm beginning to suspect that the described writing to disk issue may be unique to the x64 edition.\nIt's not happening with my combination of hardware, Windows and Notepad++.. One reason for me to stick with x32 is plugin support. One plugin I use a lot is XML Tools.. I've not yet seen the NAK - but maybe only because I've not done exactly the same as you and because mine is the x32 edition.\nWordPad does prepend the section sign with \u00c2 though, but I think that's a quirk of WordPad.\nEditPad Pro displays only the section sign.\n. I followed your 11 part plan and got the NAK.\nWow!\nBabelPad confirms that it's the NAK too!. Aside: I assume that by \"deminify\" you were using one of the Pretty Print options of XML Tools.\nI have one large XML file that it can't cope with (using x32). It never finishes processing.\nMaybe I should reconsider x64 ?. I'm on GMT+0 time zone, so I must finish now.\nbtw. I don't visit the project very often on GitHub.. I already reported that #\u00a7 displayed wrong after opening so the claim about whitespace on both sides doesn't make sense to me. \nLikewise #\u00a7# fails, as does #\u00a7#\u00a7 though #\u00a7\u00a7#\u00a7 passes.\nNB. These patterns all pass if Autodetect character encoding is disabled.\n. Doh!\nIt's the UTF-8 byte codes for the section sign U+00A7.\nOr did you not read all the earlier comments in this thread?. I did not say that.  I merely observed that the UTF-8 byte codes for \u00a7 are \\xC2\\xA7.\nThat is what you get when you convert it to UTF-8 hexadecimal byte codes using BabelPad.\nThere's really no mystery in this. This is merely a representational matter.\nI never claimed that it's represented to Notepad++ like this.\nThere are all sorts of different ways to represent the same codepoint.\n- \u00a7\n- &#x00A7;\n- \\u00A7\n- \\x{00A7}\n- C2 A7\n- \\xC2\\xA7\n- 00A7\n- 000000A7\n- U+00A7\n- SECTION SIGN\nThe one we're discussing just happens to be the form required as the Replace item in DataMystic TextPipe for Perl compatible Search and Replace filters.\nIn that context, the Search item takes the either the form \\xA7 or \\x{00A7}.. Character Properties for U+00A7\nCharacter Name = SECTION SIGN\nFormal Alias = \nAbbreviation = \nUnicode 1.0 Name = \nBlock Name = Latin-1 Supplement\nScript = Common\nIntroduced in Unicode 1.0.0 (October 1991)\nGeneral Category = Po [Punctuation, Other]\nCanonical Combining Class = 0 [Spacing, split, enclosing, reordrant, and Tibetan subjoined]\nBidi Class = ON [Other Neutrals]\nDecomposition Type = \nNumeric Type = \nBidi Mirrored = No\nJoining Type = U (Non Joining)\nJoining Group = No Joining Group\nUppercase Mapping = \nLowercase Mapping = \nTitlecase Mapping = \nLine Break = AI [Ambiguous (Alphabetic or Ideographic)]\nNotes [*], Aliases [=] and Cross-References [x]\n    * paragraph sign in some European usage\nBinary Properties\n    Grapheme Base\n    Pattern Syntax\nEncoding\n    UTF-8 = C2 A7\n    UTF-16 = 00A7\n    UTF-32 = 000000A7\n. #### Notepad++ is a Unicode text editor!\nIt should adhere to Unicode standards as to what is a word character and what is a punctuation character.\n\nA word can only begin with a word character.\nThat a non-space character might precede a word should be ignored if it's not a word character.\n\nA punctuation character is clearly not part of the word when it occurs immediately after a word.\nA punctuation character immediately before a word should be treated in exactly the same manner.\nThe Notepad++ search algorithm with match whole words only is just wrong in this respect.. It's not I who is missing the point.\nI was not searching for \u00bfJehov\u00e1 Dios when I first came across the anomaly.\nA whole word search for Jehov\u00e1 Dios should have found all 189 instances in the text.\nI merely toggled Match whole words only and spotted that the count was reduced by 1.\nThat simply should not have happened, precisely because \u00bf is not a word character.\nIts presence before one instance of the search text should have made no difference to the result.\nThat's confirmed by comparison with the fact that BabelPad does a whole word search exactly as one should expect. This is the only reason for mentioning it.\nIt's certainly not a case of \"Garbage in...garbage out\"!. #### Further evidence\n- The source text is encoded as UTF-8 (I should have stated this earlier).\n- I just replaced all 3228 instances of \u00bf by #.\n- Now a search for Jehov\u00e1 Dios gave 189 hits.\n- A whole word search for the same also gave 189 hits.\nThis clearly demonstrates that \\xBF is being treated differently to the punctuation character #.\nNotepad++ \"Match whole words only\" has a bug.\nU+00BF (INVERTED QUESTION MARK) should be treated as a punctuation character, not as a word character.\nU+00A1 (INVERTED EXCLAMATION MARK) should also be treated as a punctuation character, but it behaves the same.\nQ. How many other punctuation characters misbehave in whole word searches?\nbtw. Both \u00bf and \u00a1 match the PCRE [[:punct:]] in Notepad++ and elsewhere.\n. Thanks. @sasumner \nI recognise that reporting issues is a challenging task, one that demands conciseness as well as precision.\nI have therefore just reworded the issue report with a view to preventing other users misunderstanding in like manner. . #### Further evidence\nIt just so happens that 12 instances of Jehov\u00e1 Dios are followed by a comma, thus Jehov\u00e1 Dios,.\nAccordingly, as an experiment I replaced all Jehov\u00e1 Dios, by Jehov\u00e1 Dios\u00a1 in order to see what happens afterwards.\n\nThis time the whole word search for Jehov\u00e1 Dios found only 176 locations.\n\nThis indicates that the incorrect classification of these punctuation characters during whole word search is not position dependent relative to the search string.. There are probably many Unicode punctuation marks (or other non-word characters) that exhibit this bug in Notepad++.\nAs a random test, I replaced the 12 instances of Jehov\u00e1 Dios\u00a1 by Jehov\u00e1 Dios\u203d such that these locations end with the INTERROBANG (U+203D).  This showed the same symptoms.. If it turns out to be a Scintilla issue, I suppose that's then unlikely to be straightforward fix.\nI'd guess there are reasons why the Notepad++ team have not adopted the latest version.\nAside: This issue may impact users of non-Roman scripts even more than for the Spanish currently in focus.\ne.g. The Devangari script used for Hindi and some other Indic languages, etc.. It might help to understand where the idea comes from. \nI\u2019m a heavy user of TextPipe Standard from DataMystic. \nThe replace filters in TextPipe support PCRE and each such filter has a tick box that toggles between greedy and non-greedy matching. \nThe usefulness is that the same search pattern can be processed in two different ways \u201cunder the hood\u201d.\nIf you\u2019ve a pattern with several \u2018+\u2019 qualifiers (or \u2018*\u2019 qualifiers) you can change how the search matching works without having to edit each such qualifier in the pattern. \nI\u2019ve lost count of the number of times that this feature has been useful for me. \n. It doesn\u2019t visibly change what the user has entered in the UI - so how it works must be entirely \u201cunder the hood\u201d so to speak. . ",

I think it's better that you make up a minimal test case with which it always happen (but I'm not a developer, maybe a developer can tell you what's wrong right away).\nBe sure that you are not switching to a document with many collapsed folds, displaying them often takes a lot even with local files (I'm not sure if this has been already reported).\n. I found out what's likely the problem, it exists since the first version (4.8 - 092235e).\nIt's due to the fact that the feature is implemented by using the clipboard: all the file's contents are cut to the clipboard, the encoding is changed and then a paste is attempted.\nThis approach is crazy, there's an high chance that the final paste doesn't succeed, or that the clipboard's contents have been changed since the cut.\nThe \"enhancement\" of emptying the undo buffer after the conversion attempt (dd1dd75) is the icing on the cake.\nI found out that the feature fails almost always on my system when I have this clipboard utility enabled. Disabling it makes the feature normally work.\nIt's likely that other clipboard utilities interfere similarly.\nThe fault is not on the part of the clipboard utilities though, it's the approach that's wrong.\nThere has to be another way to do it.\nIn the meanwhile, I request that at least the undo emptying thing be removed.\nI suppose it was done to avoid showing the step when buffer is empty, before the paste is attempted, but:\n1. I'm pretty sure you can avoid that by using an UNDOACTION\n2. Seeing that step is a lot less troubling to any user than losing the whole document, in case the paste doesn't succeed\n3. It's completely unexpected that the undo history get lost when using this feature, the user might have had something important and unsaved in a previous undo state that he was confident would not get lost by simply doing the conversion. If it's not necessary the undo history should not be cleared, and if it is necessary you must warn and ask for confirmation to the user before proceeding.\nActually the way it's implemented this feature is so dangerous that I think it should be disabled, until it is fixed.\n. Can at least the \"bug:low\" label be changed?? This is a very serious bug, people can easily lose entire entire documents (few people would make a backup before trying to change the encoding of a file).\nIt is probably not hard to fix genuinely but as all problems for the users can be quickly neutralised by disabling the feature this issue should be given a high priority.\nAt the very least you should remove that undo emptying thing, although it would be safer, more respectful towards the users, to disable the feature entirely until it is completely fixed.. I think it can be considered duplicate of issue #2017\n. @kushalagrawal Does it really crash? From the rest of your message it looks like the problem is \"just\" that the now-missing files are ignored when reloading the session.\nPlease fix the title and the post if it's so.. @creckord Does Notepad++ crash whenever that (unattended restarts to apply updates) happens? Does it display the various messages that an exception occurred, that it will attempt to save any unsaved data etc.?\nP.S. I'm not sure what you mean with unattended restarts, if you mean you're not in front of the PC I guess you can't verify this.... I don't know how Notepad++ attempts to detect UTF-8 files, but it's usually just possible to rule out that a file is not UTF-8, if it contains codes or sequences illegal in UTF-8.\nIf you can you should really use BOMs for your unicode files, if you want to edit them conveniently with text editors; something that might be a BOM will probably always be regarded as a sure indicator of a unicode file, by unicode-aware editors.\n(by the way your XML class will only crash if you happen to use illegal UTF-8 characters or sequences)\n.

If the connection is restored then Notepad++ could check the datestamp and, if the same, simply remove the red stripes and continue as before without prompting the user.\n   I'm not sure whether this would be a feature that would mean much to many users, but for this user it would be a huge help!\nBest,\nToby Marthews\n.

It should be done lazily, or in the background.. I've switched from NPP to Atom, which starts up in 10 seconds for the same folder structure..

There is another translation #2764 . @donho sorry for the inconvenience. I've created a new pull request #3660 to fix that. . @donho new strings added. @SinghRajenM The current icon for Notepad++ is not suitable if making it to PNG and scale by the operating system. If you make the PNG in 70px and 150px, the users who have high resolution screen(150% and more) will see a blurred icon. If you try to make a bigger PNG, the icon on the normal screen(100%) will be unclear. This icon doesn't design to be suitable for zooming.\nAnd the current icon can fit to any resolution automatically, and seems not bad. You can see this picture, most of the icon doesn't as big as the one in Firefox.\n. @donho I'm not sure how to validate this, and I tried some characters in GBK and not GB2312(passed), and some characters included in GB18030 but not GBK(failed). My OS is in simplified Chinese. The actual encoding seems to be GBK and the description above should be right..

I just did that but there aren't any changes.\nCSS between the  in a .PHP file is still just plain black text.\n. Just a thought, if your highlighting is working properly can you upload your own stylers.xml and I'll simply replace it with mine.\n.

JS was fixed when I removed stylers.xml, but CSS is still just black text.\nIf I remember correctly there was highlighting for CSS before.\nIf there currently isn't any support for it then it shouldn't be hard to add since there already is highlighting available for CSS, all that needs to be done is to have it added between  with regex.\n.

    "dinkumoil": "I would appreciate this feature too. Already missed it.. I can confirm this odd behaviour. It seems to be an issue with the automatic encoding detection of Notepad++.\nSteps to reproduce (Notepad++ v7.4.2 32bit):\n\nOpen Notepad++ and set the default encoding for new files to ANSI. On a german Windows installation this means codepage Windows-1252.\nClose Notepad++.\nOpen Notepad++\nType only the german umlaut characters \u00e4\u00f6\u00fc\u00df\u00c4\u00d6\u00dc.\nSave the document.\nClose Notepad++\nOpen the document with Notepad++.\n\nThe file's content is displayed wrong, one can see some hebrew characters and some symbols for undisplayable characters (it's something like \u05d4\u05e6\uf895\uf893\u05b4\u05f2\uf890).\nIn the status line one can see that Notepad++'s automatic encoding detection has considered the file to be encoded with codepage Windows-1255. That's the codepage for hebrew characters.\nAfter switching the encoding to ANSI (menu Encoding -> ANSI) the file's content is displayed as \u00d7\u201d\u00d7\u00a6\u00ef\u00a2\u2022\u00ef\u00a2\u201c\u00d6\u00b4\u00d7\u00b2\u00ef\u00a2\u0090\nAfter switching encoding to Windows-1252 (menu Encoding -> Character Set -> Western European -> Windows-1252) the file's content is diplayed correct.\n@Cysign : A workaround for you would be to store your password document with encoding UCS2-Little Endian. To achieve this you have to start with an empty document and switch to this encoding schema via menu Encoding -> UCS-2 Little Endian before writing content to the document. You can confirm to be on the right encoding schema by looking at the right side of the status line at the lower edge of Notepad++'s window. It has to show UCS-2 LE BOM.\n. @justanotheranonymoususer : No, you are not. ;)\nThis change brought a bunch of issues:\n\nFixed button caption for \"Find backwards\" button, no translation ID available. This is annoying especially for users from countries using non-latin characters.\nEven if there would be a translation ID for this button: its size is too small for some (if not most) languages in the world. Applies also to the \"Find forwards\" button.\nWhen recording a macro using replace backwards no replacements are done at macro playback. Furthermore play back the recorded macro breaks the function of the \"Find backwards\" button - it searches forwards then. A restart of Npp is required to fix this.\nWhen the \"Replace\" dialog is opened it is not possible to determine in which direction the \"Replace\"/\"Replace all\" buttons will work. Concerning \"Replace all\" this comes into effect if the \"Wrap around\" checkbox is unchecked.\n\nSearch and replace are important core functionalities of every text editor. Even if the bugs 1. to 3. would be fixed - the deficiency under 4. can not be fixed easily. But it's annoying in daily work.\nI wish the changes would be reverted in the next release.\n. It seems that it could take some time until all these function list parsers have been tested. I wrote a parser for Pascal/Delphi and I would like to share it with the community.\nWhat would be better?\n\nWait until the above changes are integrated into a future release of Npp.\nFork the repository of @MAPJe71 and make a PR with my changes to it (I'm new to GitHub and Git, maybe the workflow is different).\nFork the Npp repository and make a PR to it.\n. It would be nice if you also would include #3663, the missing Pascal/Delphi parser.. I think is was an ill-considered decision to remove the radio buttons for the search direction preference. As a result we are not only in the situation of having undersized buttons (he guys, English is not the only language in the world!), furthermore we lost the option to replace backwards and that's the worst thing about this story. \n\nSo please, revert this stuff in the next release!\nAnd no, to add another two buttons for the replace function is not a good idea!\n. Seems to be reverted. See 4d921b7. Seems to be reverted. See 4d921b7. I can confirm this behaviour under certain circumstances.\nSteps to reproduce (Notepad++ v7.3.3 32 bit, same behaviour in v7.4.2 32 bit):\n\nStart a new instance of Notepad++.\nOpen \"Find\" dialog with Ctrl+F.\nConfirm that in the \"Transparency\" group box the radio button \"On losing focus\" is selected. If this is not the case, select it, close the \"Find\" dialog, restart Notepad++ and reopen the \"Find\" dialog.\nPress tab key to navigate between controls.\nOne can notice that it is possible to set the focus rectangle to the \"Always\" radio button in the \"Transparancy\" group box. Once this has happend the \"Find\" dialog gets transparent. In contrast to normal transparency mode of this dialog the title bar does not change its color to white, it turns into transparent blue instead (because the dialog still has the focus).\nWhen the \"Find\" dialog is closed while the \"Always\" radio button is not selected but focused (like on the image below) and Notepad++ is closed too, after next restart of Notepad++ the transparency preference is set to \"Always\".\n\n\nBecause the \"Transparency\" group box contains a group of radio buttons it should not be possible to set the focus rectangle to the unselected \"Always\" radio button. Normally it is only possible to set the focus rectangle to the selected button of such a group.\nWhen I tried to reproduce the bug I noticed that it doesn't occur always. But immediately after starting Notepad++ I was able to reproduce it every time.\n. You can use the option \"Make language menu compact\" to reduce the size of this menu:\n\n. Seems to be reverted. See 4d921b7. Seems to be the same like #3451. If you activate the status bar of the Notepad++ window\n\nyou will get the indicator you want:\n\n. Seems to be reverted. See 4d921b7. Seems to be reverted. See 4d921b7. This issue is obsolet as of reverting two \"Find\" buttons back to one. See 4d921b7. Backwards search/replace was disabled for regular expression mode in Npp v7.3.3 too. I guess this operation would be too complex.. Seems to be reverted. See 4d921b7\nNow the checkbox \"Backward direction\" is disabled for \"Regular expression\" search.. The intended use of XML documents is to present infomation in a machine readable format. Applications which process XML documents do this by using a XML parser. These parsers determine the encoding of XML documents by looking at the \"encoding\" field in the header data.\nI think it is correct that Npp behaves like a XML parser. Editors which do not produce defect XML files when saving them with an automatically (and sometimes wrong) detected encoding.\nAutomatic encoding detection is an unreliable process based on heuristic algorithms and therefor it fails sometimes. If a XML document is changed and stored with the wrong encoding this could break the process the XML document is involved in.\n. @tonyk24 Nice to see that you try to fix the issues I collected in #3339 \nBut OK, where are we now?\nBefore v7.4.2 we had\n\na \"Find\" button\na \"Replace\" button\na \"Replace all\" button\na \"Direction backwards\" radio button\na \"Direction forwards\" radio button\n\nThis was a clear and easy understandable/usable design.\nNow we have\n\na \"Find backwards\" button\na \"Find forwards\" button\na \"Replace\" button\na \"Replace all\" button\na \"Replace backwards\" checkbox\n\nThe number of GUI elements is the same but the design is more complicated and the usability is worse.\nTo get a \"Find backward\" and a \"Find forwards\" functionality one could install the very good \"Customize Toolbar\" plugin and place the related toolbar buttons in the toolbar. Furthermore there were already keyboard shortcuts for \"Find backward\" and \"Find forwards\". That means, the changes (in v7.4.2) which led to all this issues were simply not neccessary.\nIMHO it is worth to think about a roll back.\n. @donho \n\nDoes the direction really matter for users while replacing all ?\n\nDefinitely there are circumstances where to have the possibility to replace only in one direction (forwards or backwards) is very useful. I personally needed this feature occasionally in the past.\nTo have such a feature or not makes the difference between a good and an excellent editor.\n. It works like you expected if you add the $ sign to the word characters:\n\n. If you search for \"Whole words only\" the search engine needs to know a set of characters defining what can be part of a word. All glyphs which are not part of the set are considered to be word boundaries. Normally the set only contains letters. If you use the above setting you extend this set, that's all.. Seems to be reverted. See 4d921b7. Seems to be reverted. See 4d921b7\n. In Npp v7.5 the two buttons have been reverted back to one. See 4d921b7.. Related to #3533.. It is related to #3533 in that sense that if #3533 would be considered as a bug the issue here would be not a bug (and vice versa).. Another method (which I use) would be to install the plugin NppExec and the dependig plugin NppEventExec. Then you can define the following script for NppExec:\nnpp_sendmsg WM_COMMAND IDM_EDIT_TRIMTRAILING\nand save it as TrimTrailingSpace.\nAfter that you are able to define a rule for NppEventExec:\n\nOn event NPP_FILEBEFORESAVE\nexecute the NppExec command TrimTrailingSpace in the foreground\nfor all files whose names match the Regular expression .* (that means all files).\n\nThe advantage of this method over using the macro @sasumner mentioned above is that it also works when a file is saved by clicking the corresponding menu entry or toolbar icon.\n. @MAPJe71 Thank you for your response.\n\nPlease provide appropriate example source to be able to test/verify parser.\n\nI will do that after my holidays.\nDo you also need a file with the expected results of the parser? I was not able to generate a parser result file with the following command line (Npp v7.5):\nnotepad++.exe -export=functionList -lpas \"E:\\ParserTest.pas\"\nThe resulting file E:\\ParserTest.result was empty.\n. After spending a lot of time trying to get the Delphi parser working (with no success) I close this PR.\nI was not able to write regular expressions which are suitable for all features and coding variants of the Delphi language. Additionally there seem to be bugs in the underlying regex engine (Boost?).\nIMHO it`s worth to think about the whole concept of a parser engine based on regular expressions. In the issue tracker one can find a lot of entries concerning malfunctions of various language parsers.\n. @MAPJe71 \n\nYou could write a parser for each coding variant and activate just one with the right association.\n\nIn Delphi there doesn't exist different coding standards (with different file extensions) like e.g. in Fortran. With coding variants I meant for instance\n\nthe presence or absence of certain sections in a Delphi source file (constants/types/variables declaration).\nthe order of these sections.\npossible multiple occurence of sections.\nmixing source code with comments.\ngeneric classes/methods (the < and > characters were causing problems).\nnested (generic) classes.\nthe indistinguishability of function/procedure prototypes and their headers at the point of implementation.\nfunctions/procedures local to another function/procedure (with the ability of unlimited nesting).\nfunctions/procedures local to another function/procedure mixed with constants/types/variables declaration sections and comments.\n\nThere are a lot more of detail problems (and their interconnections) I don't remember at the moment.\nI am frustrated and fed up with this whole thing and I already deleted all my test cases and trials, so don't ask for them.\nMaybe somebody who is better in regular expressions will implement a parser some day.\n. @plagoni \n\nGo to the Files changed section of this PR.\nInsert the green marked lines into the file C:\\Users\\<UserName>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Notepad++\\functionList.xml.\n\nBut note that the provided parser has some deficiencies and does not cover all possible coding variants and features of Delphi. I was not able to solve these problems and stopped development to avoid constantly emerging support and enhancement requests. So you are on your own if you use this parser.\n. Please consider an update, this was fixed in Npp v7.5. Also the two \"Find\" buttons have been reverted to one button.\n. The context menu entry \"Plugin Commands -> Copy Text with Syntax Highlighting\" derives from the NppExport plugin. It is an alias for \"Plugins -> NppExport -> Copy all formats to clipboard\" in the main menu. This means the document's content is copied twice to the clipboard. One copy provides the syntax highlighting information through RTF (Rich Text Format) encoding, the other one through HTML encoding. It seems that all the editors where you failed to paste the document's content including syntax highlighting don't pull the RTF version from the clipboard.\nTry copying the documents content with \"Plugins -> NppExport -> Copy RTF to clipboard\" and paste it then to the editor or your choice. Of course this editor must support RTF (MS Word, Wordpad and OpenOffice do, LibreOffice should too).\nIf this doesn't work there could be some clipboard related problem at your system.\nIf it works you can click to \"Settings -> Edit popup ContextMenu\" in the main menu. A XML file will open where you can reconfigure the \"Plugin Commands -> Copy Text with Syntax Highlighting\" entry to be an alias for \"Plugins -> NppExport -> Copy RTF to clipboard\".\n. I digged a little deeper and found that on my system (Win 7 64 bit) Notepad++ v7.5.1 (32 bit) with NppExport v0.2.8 puts the following formats to the clipboard:\n\nCF_LOCALE\nCF_OEMTEXT\nCF_TEXT\nCF_UNICODETEXT\nHTML Format\nRich Text Format\n\nI can paste to Wordpad directly with working syntax highlighting.\nMS Word 2016 (32 bit) puts these formats to the clipboard, maybe it is useful for future enhancements:\n\nCF_ENHMETAFILE\nCF_METAFILEPICT\nCF_TEXT\nCF_UNICODETEXT\nEmbed Source\nHTML Format\nLink Source\nLink Source Descriptor\nObject Descriptor\nObjectLink\nRich Text Format\n. @SinghRajenM \n\nCurrently my AutoCodepage plugin is broken because of your changes in v7.5.2. Updating encoding definition values in \"menuCmdID.h\" would break it permanently.\nI think the fix of @dnakamura is the best solution.\n. @dail8859 \nSeems to be used for this list (screenshot taken from Npp v7.3.3):\n\nThe list gets filled by the for-loop starting in line 1159 of preferenceDlg.cpp. This loop uses the array encodings as source for the encodings to be shown in the combobox. That means it would be possible to reduce or increase the number of items of the encodings array to change the set of encodings shown in the combobox.\nI would say preferenceDlg.cpp has not to be changed. But it depends on EncodingMapper::getIndexFromEncoding (called in line 1161 of preferenceDlg.cpp).. You are running a 64 bit version of Notepad++ so you have to use the 64 bit version of the plugin manager too. You can download it here (take the x64 version).\nThe plugin manager was removed from Notepad++ in v7.5 (see here). A fix is on its way. See #3992.. The story still isn't finished. There is a bug in the calculation of the grid's height during vertical resizing, mostly the grid overlaps the description field underneath.\nThe problem is that the height of the grid always is a multiple of one grid line whereas the height of the dialog and thus the position of the description field can be adjusted pixel-wise.\n\n. There is already a plugin named AutoSave which seems to do what yout want. You can install it via PluginManager.\nSince the PluginManager was removed from Notepad++ installer in v7.5 you might miss it on your machine. In this case you can download PluginManager from here and install it manually.\n. Seems like @donho already fixed this (see here).\nYou could try the preview build (its only the Npp EXE file) from here and see if it works for you.. Have you tried the printing options below?\n\n. @sasumner \n@guy038 only gave a workaround how one can deal with the current buggy behaviour. But this is not a real solution. Currently Notepad++ is not acting acceptably and this should be fixed. Unfortunately only german-writing users are affected by this bug, I guess this won't speed up fixing it.... @sasumner : I would do it if I were a C++ dev. Unfortunately  more than 25 years ago I've switched from C (my \"first love\" beside MC68K assembly ;) ) to Pascal and later on to Delphi instead to C++. Nowadays this language is blown up in a disastrous way, I don't want to learn it anymore.. I have some news concerning this issue and want to revise my statement above. See my posting in the community forum.. As far as I know it is not possible to assign keyboard shortcuts directly to the entries of the Language menu. But you can emulate it.\n\nInstall the NppExec plugin.\nNow you can write oneliner scripts to send a Windows message to Notepad++ to simulate a mouse click on a certain menu entry. To do this go to menu Plugins - NppExec - Execute...\nAfter that you can assign these scripts to entries in the Macro menu. To do this go to menu Plugins - NppExec - Advanced options...\nFinally you can assign keyboard shortcuts to these entries via the shorcut mapper as usual.\n\nA NppExec script to simulate a click to the Java menu entry would be\nnpp_sendmsg WM_COMMAND IDM_LANG_JAVA\nYou can find the IDM_LANG_XXX constants for all languages in a file that will be copied to your machine when installing the NppExec plugin. This file is stored under\n<Notepad++ installation directory>\\plugins\\NppExec\\menuCmdID.h\nSearch for IDM_LANG, below this line you will find all language constants.\n . Add to every NppExec script the following code as first line:\nnpp_console ?\nThis makes NppExec to keep the current state of its console window - if it was hidden it will stay hidden.\nFor further questions please consult the comprehensive help of NppExec under menu Plugins - NppExec - Help/Manual. The console window also provides an online help for every command by typing help <command>. Typing only help displays a brief introduction to the features of NppExec.\n. @nathanm \nI guess you are mixing up two different mechanisms for write protecting a file. But the UI of Notepad++ is admittedly confusing in this point. \nThere are two menu entries which tell us that they manipulate the file's write protection:\n\nEdit - Set Read-only\nEdit - Clear Read-only flag\n\nThe first one only toggles an internal flag of Notepad++ (or the underlying Scintilla component) whereas the second one clears the file system's \"Read only\" file attribute - and this is an one-way ticket because it's not possible to set this attribute from within Notepad++.\n. I think this can't be achieved in the way you would prefer. Imagine Notepad++ would store the state of its internal read-only flag for all files which it has been opened ever - the config file would grow to GBs over time.. I would like to have such a feature too.. 1. If you want to report a bug in Notepad++ please also provide debugging informations. They are available via \"Menu ? -> Debug Info...\".\n2. There is a newer version of the CS-Script plugin available (v1.7.9.0).\n3. This is a bug in the CS-Script plugin and thus here is the wrong place for reporting it. Go instead to this site.\n. Do you mean this?\n\nAlso available via main menu:\n\n. @sasumner \nYou are right, I presumably missed the real intention of @Hosen1989 's feature request.\n\nIf somebody wants to implement this feature take into account that there are the following features in Notepad++ which have to be enhanced too:\n\nIt is possible to jump to search results marked by the \"Find & Mark\" dialog\n\n\nThe same is in the \"Jump Down\" submenu.\n\n\nThe macro recorder for the \"Find & Mark\" dialog should be enhanced too.\n\n\nIf you consider to enhance the style configurator you should consider to enhance the themes files too.. I was able to find the reason for this behaviour with the help of WinSpy++.\n\n\nIn single-row-mode the TCS_BUTTONS bit of the tabbar's WindowStyle bitmask is not set. In multi-row-mode this bit is set, thus the tabs are drawn like buttons what's causing the effect mentioned above.\nNeither I'm a C++ developer nor do I use VisualStudio, so I'm not able to fix this issue.. OK, according to this comment this issue isn't possible to fix. Functionality beats design.. @CookiePLMonster : It's not about Windows XP, it's about ReactOS which unfortunately seems to use a code basis which mimics Windows XP ore even some older version of Windows.\nI'm not involved in the ReactOS project and don't use it, just my 50 cents.. @ajtruckle \nI wrote a plugin which can display 0-based line numbers (if you want as hex numbers, too). It can be (de-)activated by an entry in the Plugins menu and saves its activation state and settings in an INI file in order to restore them at the next run of Notepad++.\nYou can download it here. It would be great if you would provide some feedback and/or ideas for enhancements.\nSince the plugin is not available via PluginManager (and will not in the near future), it has to be installed manually. Installation instructions can be found on the project page.\nNote: If you work with large files (10000 or more lines, depends on your hardware) the plugin will cause a serious performance decrease when loading the file and inserting or deleting lines because custom line numbers in Scintilla can only be done by self-filled text margins.. @cmeriaux \n\nnice plugin !\n\nThank you!\n\nI'm just curious, what is the plugin language ? Pascal ?\n\nIt's Delphi (version XE2 to be precise, published in 2011). So yes, it's a sort of Object Pascal.\n. @ajtruckle \n\nIs it possible that we have the column 4 characters wide for the whole document?\n\nSorry, that's not possible with a plugin. The width of the line numbers margin is managed by Notepad++. I've already tried to set the margin width according to the actual width of hexadecimal line numbers (the number of digits of hexadecimal numbers grows slower than the number of digits of decimal numbers) - it failed.\nThe Notepad++ documentation at this page states:\n\nSince the width of the margin is computed whenever display changes, setting its width may not be useful. The width is computed to be as large as needed, with a minimum of three digits (to avoid annoying jump effects btween line 99 and 100).\n\n. @ajtruckle  and @cmeriaux \nThe latest release of my plugin no longer causes a performance decrease of Notepad++, even when editing large files. You can download it here.. @sasumner \n\nI looked at the changes but it was not clear to me...\n\nYes, I have to apologize. Since I'm currently the only contributor to this project I don't have the discipline to only check in small changes and to avoid simply cosmetic changes like code restructuring.\n\nwhat was the cause of the performance problem\n\nMy code for activating and actually doing custom line numbering was inspired by this posting. The author uses a brute-force algorithm for line numbering - \"Number all lines of the document\" respectively \"Number all lines starting from the point a line was inserted or deleted\".\nI understood that it would be better to hook some sort of \"OnDocumentScrolled\" event and only number lines which are in sight but since there were some other problems to solve I've postponed this problem to the end of development - well, nearly to the end. Today I became aware that increasing the size of the Notepad++ window leads to missing line numbers, I've already released a new version.\n. @ajtruckle \nGo to this page and download the appropriate ZIP file for your Notepad++ version (32 bit => CustomLineNumbers_v1.1.5_UNI.zip, 64 bit => CustomLineNumbers_v1.1.5_x64.zip). Follow the installation instructions here.\n. Oh yes, and also think about blue, it is the color for text processing software because MS Word has set it as a standard. But damned, Visio is also blue, it's even the same kind of blue like Word. And Outlook is blue, and Internet Explorer, and TeamViewer, and TotalCommander, and InnoSetup, and ... \nThe only solution to prevent 50% of world wide computer users from going to the madhouse is - Patented colors including all of their shades for all MS office programs! It will be interesting to see the Word and Visio divisions fight each other at the courts.\nIf you complain \"But the only remaining colors will be black, white and grey!\" - that doesn't matter, it fits the glorious design of Windows 10 in an optimal way.. As you already mentioned, Windows EOL format is CR+LF (carriage return + line feed) which is encoded as \\r\\n. The Macintosh EOL format is CR (carriage return only) which is encoded as \\r.\nWhy do you expect that the two characters \\r\\n (Windows EOL format) are found by the single character search expression \\n or .? And why do you expect that the character \\r (Macintosh EOL format) is found by the search expression \\n?\nWith Macintosh EOL format in your example the search expression 1.1 succeeds.\nEverything works like expected, please close this issue.\n. I'm not responisble for anything, I'm just a guy.\nI agree that the built-in english localization could be misleading as it speaks of \". matches newline\":\n\nMaybe you should close this issue and report another issue concerning this ambiguous expression. But don't be too optimistic that it gets resolved... Just my 2 cents.\n. In the case somebody else stumbles upon this issue:\nThe problem is caused by a fix related to the internal id of the Javascript language since the file C:\\Users\\<UserName>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Notepad++ stays unchanged when Notepad++ gets updated.\nTo fix the problem:\n\n\nOpen the file mentioned above in Notepad++ and search the following line\n<association id=\"javascript_function\"     langID=\"19\"/>\n\n\nReplace the number 19 with 58.\n. @sasumner Seems the fix was brought by this commit. Don Ho states that it fixes a regression introduced in 2016. So yes, it's rather old.. Maybe this is not a bug. Please ensure that the following option is unchecked:\n\n\n\n. @rsubasic As far as I know user defined languages are only connected with the syntax highlighting mechanism of Notepad++. The highlighting per double-click is a separate feature, it's a variant of a plain text search like the Find/Replace dialog.. > ...is it possible to define a default/assumed encoding?\nYou can do that in the preferences dialog:\n\nThis effects all file types.\nIf you want to be more specific you can use my AutoCodepage plugin (available also via PluginManager) to define UTF-8 as encoding for certain file types only.. > But that encoding preference is only for new files?\nNo, it's not. If you set the options mentioned above and a file's encoding could be UTF-8 or ANSI, Notepad++ will choose UTF-8. I was able to verify this with \"normal\" text files without any special characters.\nI guess your issue derives from the long-known problems in the automatic-encoding-detection feature of Notepad++. Maybe my plugin could be a workaround for you. I don't know any other solution and I don't think that we will see a fix for the problem in the near future nor if it is possible to fix it at all.. @CookiePLMonster \n\nFor archival purposes, could somebody try and list all duplicates of this issue?\n\nThe number of maybe related issues has reached a far too high amount, I don't have time to test them. But I spent some time with searching for related issues.\nI've searched for issues with the following filter is:issue is:open encoding and found the following ones which seem to be related to the bug (I've stopped digging deeper when the results became 2 years old or even older):\n4878, #4767,  #4428, #4246, #3705, #3441, #3405, #3172, #2153\nAdditionally #3759 reports the following: #940, #2843, #3188, #3222, #3588\nI'm sure one will find much more by using different search terms.\n. @CookiePLMonster \nWould be very good if you would grab responsibility for these annoying bugs. It seems that very often people are affected by this issue which live in countries where cyrillic characters are used. Since just from these people come some very useful contributions to the Notepad++ universe (e.g. plugins) they deserve some attention (just my 2 cents).. The content of your file is ill-crafted.\nWhen you configure Notepad++ to show also control characters\n\nyou can see the following:\n\nI guess the content of your file was produced by pressing CTRL+C when a message box displayed by a particular software was the active window. The middle part (between the two minus sign framed blocks) is the content of the message box and as such has been generated by the software.\nIn the second picture you can see that all lines of the message text are terminated with a CR (carriage return) sign followed by a CR+LF (carriage return + line feed). CR is the line break symbol in Macintosh format and CR+LF is the line break symbol in Windows format. Since Notepad++ is able to interprete both line break formats it does simply what it is expected to do - it generates line breaks.\nSo it's not a problem of Notepad++, it's a problem of the software generating the message box content since it fills in line breaks in an invalid format. The Windows MessageBox function used to display the original message box is tolerant about invalid line breaks thus you don't see them.. > Please keep in mind that I did not open the file in Notepad++. Instead, I opened it in Windows Notepad and copied the contents which I then pasted into Notepad++.\nIf I do the same I get the same result like you.\n\nDo you mean that Windows Notepad is eating a carriage return when displaying the text file because of the \"CR\" before it, but it still allows copying it?\n\nCR is not a valid Windows line break symbol, so yes, Notepad eats it when displaying the text file. But when the content of the Notepad window is copied to the clipboard there seems to happen some kind of conversion CR -> CR+LF. I don't know who is responsible for that - Notepad by itself or the Windows clipboard routines.\nIf you open your text file in a hex editor you can see that its content is exactly like it's shown in my second picture above.\n. @sasumner \n\nScintilla will intercept the paste and will convert all different line-endings to the current line ending type\n\nThanks for clarification.. @mdell-seradex  Windows Notepad and MS Word don't support Macintosh-style line breaks (single CR chars) but Notepad++ does. That's the reason why Npp processes them and converts them to the format used for the current file. As @sasumner already wrote Notepad++ can not predict if it makes sense to do that conversion in a certain situation.. @tbayart \nThough you can't imagine, there are people around who really need the functionality which you call a bug. Please believe it and close this issue.. The \"Wrap around\" checkbox is checked in a fresh Notepad++ installation, you already got your \"logical\" behaviour of the \"Search & Replace\" dialog.\nThis checkbox is intended for some special situations where it is necessary to do a replace operation from the current cursor position to e.g. EOF only. If you toggle the state of this checkbox and get unexpected results it is a RTFM problem and not worth to report a bug. Please close this issue.. @DonBarredora \nWell, it is documented somewhere...\nAt the homepage of Notepad++ under \"resources\" (left menu bar) you can find a link to the Notepad++ wiki.\nThere, the link under (left menu bar) \"NP++ ARTICLES -> byTopic -> F -> Find and replace\" finally leads you to the page How to find, replace and highlight text in Notepad++.\nAlso on the wiki's main page, under (left menu bar) \"NP++ RESOURCES -> Guides\", you can find a link to a page where you can download the user manual for Notepad++ v6.6.4 as CHM file (click on \"User manual - v6.6.4 (CHM)\").\nAfter downloading the file maybe (it depends on your web browser) you have to unblock it because Windows Explorer considers it to be an unsafe file from the internet. To do that go to your download folder, right-click the downloaded file, select \"Properties\" and click on \"Unblock\" and then \"Apply\".\n\nOpen the CHM file by double-clicking it, navigate to chapter \"Searching\" and open subchapter \"Normal Search\".\nI know, you will say \"Naah, it's an outdated file, hidden in an outdated wiki full of broken links!\" and you are right.\nThe broken links are there because in the beginning the Notepad++ project was hosted on  sourceforge.net for a long time. From mid-2013 SourceForge introduced a program called DevShare, which offered projects a way to monetize their downloads by having an optional download that includes prompts for the user to download additional software that is not part of the project (the program was cancelled in February 2016 after SourceForge's owner had changed). \nAs a consequence of this the Notepad++ team decided to leave SourceForge. Unfortunately the wiki respectively the contained links have never been ported completely to the new location, a lot of links still lead to SourceForge pages which are not existing anymore.\nNotepad++ is open source, it is maintained by volunteers and is given to you for free, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Also feel free to improve the situation and update the wiki respectively the help file mentioned above.. Duplicate to #4711. Duplicate of issue(s) xxxx (don't want to search, but I'm sure there are some).\nOpen preferences dialog, navigate to \"Default Directory\" tab and find \"Use new style dialog...\". Please close this issue.\n. I can confirm this issue as long as the old Save dialog is used. If you switch to the new one (under menu Settings -> Preferences -> Register \"Default Directory\" -> Checkbox \"Use new style dialog ...\") an error message pops up that states \"The file name is invalid\".\nI guess when calling the GetOpenFileName Win32 API, in the Flags member of the OPENFILENAME struct the flag OFN_NOVALIDATE is set and the implementation of the according hook function is buggy.. I can confirm this issue as long as the old Save dialog is used. If you switch to the new one (under menu Settings -> Preferences -> Register \"Default Directory\" -> Checkbox \"Use new style dialog ...\") an error message pops up that states \"You do not have permission to access this file...\".\nCould be related to #4785 and #4788.. > ...wouldn't it be the time to either:\n\n\nSay goodbye to the old style dialog\nMake new style dialog a default\n\n\nWouldn't it be time instead to introduce a more strict policy for merging PRs into to release branch of Notepad++? It is very common to see in this project that things get broken because of obviously poorly tested changes to the code base.. > Flow of accepting new PRs to the project is slow as-is\nThat's one reason more to test more thoroughly. The fixes for bugs introduced by changes of already existing features may block PRs with improved or new features.. To get rid off the inconvenience you mentioned in your use case you could use the SaveAsAdmin plugin. If saving a file fails because elevation is needed for the desired location an UAC dialog pops up and after confirming it the file gets saved.. NppAdminAccess.exe is a temporary EXE file generated by the plugin's DLL. This EXE actually does the job of saving the document to the desired location. To achieve this it needs elevation, there is no way to magically saving files to protected locations on the hard disk without elevation.\nIf you answer \"No\" in the UAC dialog, as a convenience feature the plugin allows you to restart Notepad++ with admin rights. But then it runs permanently with admin rights. In contrast, saving via NppAdminAccess.exe keeps Notepad++ running with user rights.. Can you confirm that the following setting is NOT checked while monitoring?\n\n. If the setting above is turned off you won't get reload confirmation dialogs anymore while monitoring files, this is my experience. But as you already said, normaly everybody still wants change detection of non-monitored files. Maybe you should extend your report and include this fact.\n. You can't register for the community forum. Currently logging in is only possible with the credentials of a GitHub account. So, you need to sign up for a GitHub account.\n. As a workaround you could use the user defined language highlighter for T-SQL.\n\nDownload it on this site. Search for T-SQL (MS Server 2008R2), right-click the link and choose \"Save as...\" or something like that (depends on your browser).\nNow you have to import the file into Notepad++ via menu \"Language\" -> Define your language... (UDL dialog pops up)-> Button \"Import...\".\nCustomize the highlighter to your needs via the UDL dialog. I personally don't like the underlined text style provided by the default configuration. Note: Switching highlighting and background colors via themes doesn't work with user defined languages, you have to change the colors via the UDL dialog too.. @Hammerite \n\nI wrote a plugin which can display line numbers as (at minimum) 2-digit 0-based hex numbers. It can be (de-)activated by an entry in the Plugins menu and saves its activation state in an INI file in order to restore it at the next run of Notepad++.\nYou can download it here (click on \"1 release\" in the menu bar) . It would be great if you would provide some feedback and/or ideas for enhancements.\nSince the plugin is not available via PluginManager (and will not in the near future), it has to be installed manually. Installation instructions can be found on the project page.. @Hammerite \nThe latest release of my plugin got some improvements:\n\nLine numbers as hex numbers can be switched on/off.\nThe starting line number can be configured.\n\nFurthermore it no longer causes a performance decrease of Notepad++, even when editing large files. You can download it here.. Duplicate of #4409.. May be related to #4885.\n. If it's resolved please close this issue.\n. To achieve this you could use the RunMe plugin. It executes the currently opend file based on its shell association.\nA more flexible way would be to use the NppExec plugin. It provides a console to execute commands in Notepad++ and also allows scripting. Its help file shows example scripts how to call compilers of different programming languages.\nI personally use the second solution. I wrote a base script which I can call via keyboard shortcut. According to the current file's extension it calls scripts to start the appropriate compiler or interpreter. In this way a have a sort of shell for 12 programming/scripting languages, including VBScript, Batch Script, GNU Plot, C, C#, SQL and InnoSetup.. @bbotz \n\nLightwight solution: There is a plugin called NppFavorites available, might be sufficient for you.\nFull-blown solution: There is the Explorer plugin which has among a lot of other useful things a favorites feature.\n. @sasumner You are right, I've missed that these plugins don't provide a 64 bit version. Since I'm used to use the 32 bit version of Notepad++ just because of poor 64 bit plugin support I forget this important criteria sometimes.. Update: The NppFavorites plugin is available as 64 bit version now (and can also downloaded as 32 bit version from the same site, I have to admit that one had to switch to a forked repository to do that before).. Yes, this is (at least for me) a well known and annoying bug because I use batch script quite often.\n\nI provide a screenshot of the code above to make it more clear:\n\n. I personally gave it up to use Notepad++ for file monitoring. I found a utility called TailSharp, it can be downloaded here (look in the right side bar entitled \"Downloads\"). \nThis utility is able to monitor the file created with the script posted by @SinghRajenM above even if you omit the timeout /t 2 command.. @sasumner \nglogg seems to be more powerful than TailSharp. Thanks for this hint, I'll give it a try.. @somebadhat \nTo open Find dialog press Ctrl+F. The F3 shortcut is in Windows programs commonly used as \"Continue search\" and not as \"Start search\". If you don't like that you can change the shortcuts to your needs, like @sasumner already wrote.\nPlease close this issue.. I have to second @somebadhat  - there is no \"Save As\" button in Notepad++. Also the latest release of the CustomizeToolbar plugin (v4.1) doesn't include such a button. . > is there any reason a \"custom\" ... button for SaveAs can't be made (by the end-user) in the CustomizeToolbar plugin?\nWell, it is possible to create custom buttons with this plugin. But I found it is not working reliably.\nOften the buttons are greyed out after starting Notepad++, but if you start it via Explorer context menu (Edit with Notepad++) the buttons work.\nFurthermore, adding buttons depends on the UI language since buttons have to be connected to a menu item using a chain of the texts of all menu entries involved.\nFinally the buttons have to be in a special BMP format (256 colors i.e. 8 bits per pixel). This format is not very common, the only program I know which can convert normal BMPs to 8 BPP is IrvanView.\nBut besides all that mentioned before - regardless that there is a plugin which let users define own buttons the feature request of @somebadhat is a valid one. To decline that would be the same like saying \"You miss a feature in Notepad++? Oh, there is the Python plugin, you can write a script to get the functionality you want, no need to integrate it in Notepad++ itself\".\nLet the developers decide if someone wants to invest the effort for the requested button.\n. > which is a shame because here we have a dedicated plugin to do something ... and it is apparently working poorly.\nNevertheless it is a useful plugin. I like it very much, it has become one of my standard plugins which I use in every Notepad++ installation. Without that plugin the toolbar is a whole mess and it takes from me the burden to remember a lot of keyboard shortcuts of frequently used Notepad++ functionalities.\n\nGood discussion; thanks.\n\nDitto. @sasumner \nYou are right, these entries are created by the Customize Toolbar Plugin, but in russian.xml there are entries to translate them (search e.g. for 44212 in all files of the localization directory of a portable installation) and if I add equivalent entries to german.xml the menu items get translated.\nBecause there are entries in russian.xml I never thought that the menu items could be related to a plugin, shame on me.\nI will close this issue and the related PR. Thank you for hinting me to that mistake.\n. The menu items which are related to the language file entries this PR is about, are created by the Customize Toolbar plugin. Though the entries are contained in russian.xml this can be considered as a bug.\nSince plugin-created menu items should not to be integrated in common language files I close this PR.. Which version of Notepad++ do you run? Please provide debug infos from (menu) ? -> Debug info.. I have tested with v7.6 (32 bit). There this bug doesn't occur.\n@TomasRiker \nBe warned: If you use plugins you will run into trouble with Notepad++ v7.6 since the storage location for plugins has been changed. Furthermore it will change in the next release once more. I recommend to wait with updating until the next release. Additionally you should read related postings in the community forum to be prepared for the required tasks. As a starting point read this.\nAs a workaround and quick solution I can recommend grepWin from one of the developers of Tortoise SVN client, see the web site and the code repository. Personally I prefer version 1.7.2 because of some glitches in the UI of newer versions.. @donho \nThe following command sequence (using the ICACLS console tool) would set the access rights of the plugins directory and the plugins\\config directory to a desired state.\nPlease note: I don't want to encourage you to actually use ICACLS to accomplish this task, the access rights plugin of NSIS should be able to do the same steps. I am posting this only as a guideline.\nI have tested the script on a Windows 7 x64 machine without an Active Directory environment. According to this site the user group DOMAINADMINS is a member of the local ADMINISTRATORS user group. Thus, the access rights set by the script should be sufficient in an Active Directory environment.\nBut there could raise up a problem with the DOMAINUSERS user group. This group has no universal SID since the SID of the domain is part of the SID for this user group. Maybe there is a way using the NSIS access rights plugin to set the same access rights for the DOMAINUSERS group like for the local USERS group (SID S-1-5-32-545).\n````\n@echo off & setlocal\nset \"PluginsDir=%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Notepad++\\plugins\"\nset \"PluginsListDir=%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Notepad++\\plugins\\config\"\n::Set owner of directory to local ADMINISTRATORS user group\nicacls \"%PluginsDir%\" /setowner *S-1-5-32-544\n::Set ACL of directory for plugins to standard value,\n::includes only inherited access rights\nicacls \"%PluginsDir%\" /reset\n::Set ACL of directory for plugin list to standard value,\n::includes only inherited access rights\nicacls \"%PluginsListDir%\" /reset\n::Remove access rights inheritance from directory for plugins\nicacls \"%PluginsDir%\" /inheritance:r\n::Set full access rights for local SYSTEM account on plugins directory\n::and activate inheritance for this permission\nicacls \"%PluginsDir%\" /grant:r *S-1-5-18:(CI)(OI)(F)\n::Set full access rights for local ADMINISTRATORS user group on plugins\n::directory and activate inheritance for this permission\nicacls \"%PluginsDir%\" /grant *S-1-5-32-544:(CI)(OI)(F)\n::Set read access rights for local USERS user group on plugins directory\n::and activate inheritance for this permission\nicacls \"%PluginsDir%\" /grant *S-1-5-32-545:(CI)(OI)(GR,GE,RD,X,RA)\n::Set restricted write access rights for local USERS user group on files and\n::directories INSIDE the plugins list directory and activate inheritance for\n::this permission\nicacls \"%PluginsListDir%\" /grant *S-1-5-32-545:(CI)(OI)(IO)(DE,GW,WD,AD,DC,WA,WEA)\n::Allow creation and restoration of files and directories for local USERS user\n::group in the plugins list directory\nicacls \"%PluginsListDir%\" /grant *S-1-5-32-545:(WD,AD,WA,WEA)\n````.

The relevant section of the file is the same. Just to be sure, I also grabbed the newest version of SciTE (3.6.4) and it exhibits the same highlighting behavior.\n. Interesting. I get different results, but this gives some new avenues to explore. I suspect it shouldn't matter but I'm running Windows 10. Before digging into the code, I should have performed some basic troubleshooting.\nBut for the same of completeness, below is the behavior that I see:\nIn free form:\n- ! works as I expect...it can be used to start a comment at the beginning of a line or anywhere on the line. \n- c and C do not work for me...should start comment highlight when they are the first character on a line like your picture shows.\n\nIn fixed form:\nNeither ! nor c nor C appear to work and for that matter none of the highlighting appears to be functional.\n\n. The issue with fixed form not doing any highlighting is theme related. I did a fresh install on another computer and the fixed form was working on the Default theme. As soon as I switched to Deep Black, the syntax highlighting stopped. A quick flip through the themes makes it look like it doesn't work for any theme other than the Default. I observed the same behavior on the original install. But, on the Default theme the fixed form highlighting covers all 4 comment cases as expected.\nI tried renaming styles.xml in %appdata% on that same fresh install. It did recreate a styles.xml file, but it didn't impact the highlighting in free form or fixed form.\nIn your screenshot, did you have free form or fixed form selected?\n. And, after reviewing Fortran 90 (aka free form) commenting rules the standard is to use only ! and not c or C. My company doesn't follow the standards so I picked up bad habits and I never knew until now.\nTo summarize:\n-I think the fixed form has a theme-related bug that prevents any syntax highlighting in any theme except the Default.\n-Free form syntax highlighting is behaving exactly as it is described in every standards reference I can find and I'm an idiot for thinking it should behave differently.\n. I can see how that would be tedious. I can at least add fortran77 to those files.\nIs it simply the ones in \\PowerEditor\\installer\\themes\\?\n. ",

Some legitimate examples of accidental save-all being disruptive:\n- test-driven development where a process is watching for changes and will fire off unit tests when they occur\n- playing with tweaks to logic you don't want to keep and are copying into another tool like a db query browser\n- just have many files open and some may have rogue edits from accidental clicks or keypresses (especially when making frequent switches between text area and search dialog)\n- those unfortunate situations when you are working on something not in source control (yet or ever)\nI don't know if the legitimate cases really warrant a modal dialog preventing accidental usage, but I will note that it can be a real hassle if you have many files open and can't even remember which ones had disposable/bad edits in them that you didn't intend to save.\n.

    "PomDev2": "Workaround Found\nWell, it's been 8 days since the first post, so, being impatient, I downloaded the source and examined the software. AFAICT, the function Buffer::checkFileState() is called for every open buffer every time NP++ is reactivated. This function uses the PathFileExists() Windows API function multiple times to see if the file can be opened. This function is the topic of much discussion on the web. Apparently, it is very slow with UNC names. The MSDN documentation includes a note that the function can be used only for unc files, and not \\server or \\server\\share, which has implications for creating new directories (e.g., for backup), etc. \nI was wondering how I would patch my copy of NP++, when I tried a little experiment. I mapped a drive letter to the network share I was using, and opened the networked files only through that mapping instead of using a unc path. Closing then reopening NP++ (to pick up the mapping), then switching away from NP++ with three open files, browsing, etc., for an extended period of time, then reactivating (clicking on) NP++, there was no hang! Hooray! I can use my computer again!\nOf course, this is not a real fix. I do need to be able to open files on network shares using unc paths, so I would vote to have this problem really addressed. I guess the answer is to replace the PathFileExists() function with something else that doesn't hang so badly using network shares. And to call it just once per function call (OK, twice if wow64 redirection is in effect) and save the result. \nThe good news is that using a drive mapping really eliminates the problem for files on a small number of machines (one drive letter each) that have to be open all day long and might be modified by another user or process. The notification still happens right away, which is great! I hope these posts are not too obnoxious. Thank you all.\nOOPS, I didn't mean to close the issue (below). I reopened it. Hope that's ok.\n.

For example, configuration keys. You don't know if they're in .txt files, .ini files, .xml files, .cfg files, or what other sort of file. But you have a string that you know is in there. If these options were improved, the issue would be mitigated somewhat (being able to exclude .exe and .dll files from your *.* search filter, for example, would be a great start).\n\nThis information could also be collected throughout the operation and reported singularly at the end like the results are instead of utilizing the message dialog. It would be nice to be able to cancel the operation if one of these pops up, but that would be nice generally speaking and doesn't need to be related.\nIf keeping the dialog is desired, I've taken a look at the code and API revision will be required since a catch block divorced from the context of what's going on pops up the error and it's a simple MessageBox, not something more complex that could be customized. This load function is used by several places, so it may not be so straightforward to change the API.\nI'm interested in solving this issue because I'm quite tired of having to hit OK hundreds of times for a search. The only question is basically how @donho wants to handle the work.\nWhat I would personally like to see is something sort of like this mockup:\n\nThe reason why I would like to see this is that I can see it being useful for some searches even if you don't want it most of the time. The ability to banish it temporarily or permanently makes me feel good about it being the default so the user knows it exists.\nI realize that this would require quite a bit of API change, but I don't mind doing that as long as I know I'll be able to work with the author and get the code into mainline.

If not, it can just close the dialogue and pop the results up.. Duplicate of #1889.. Duplicate of #1889, #2072. Might I suggest taking a look at my comment in #1889?

This will not happen when submitted to Store (obviously). When uploaded to the Store, it will just be navigating to the entry, and clicking \"Install.\" \nNOTE 3: If upgrading to Revision 6 from Revision 0, you don't need to install the certificate again. Just double-click it, and \"Install\".

Instructions:\n1) Make sure a proper base image is installed, run DesktopAppConverter app as Admin.\n2) In this example, directory system looks like:\n- Downloads\n- - npp.7.5.1.Installer.exe\n- - notepad++ (folder)\n- - - npp.build (folder, always use for current build)\n- - - - cert.pfx\n- - - - mynamehere.cer\n- - - - PackageFiles (folder)\n- - - - - Assets (folder)\n- - - - - localization (folder)\n- - - - - plugins (folder)\n- - - - - VFS (folder)\n- - - - - notepad++.exe\n- - - - - AppxManifest.xml\n- - - - - [Various other system-generated files...]\n- - - npp.build.11.10.2017 [...]\n- - - npp.build.11.09.2017 [...]\n3) Always rename a build, once completed, to have the date added at the end.

    "MaxCorman": "I would seriously like this feature to be resolved since i use Notepad++ for normal text categorization as the Python, Nimrod, and Matlab languages are very convenient since they don't require putting characters everywhere for folding.\nIs there some kind of workaround to this?. @zufuliu What is all this code that you just submitted? And what is the code in the link? Are they scripts that can be used for a workaround to get proper indentation with tabs in Python in Notepad++ or are they actual re-coding of Scintilla? I am confused. Sorry for being a beginner programmer and not  understanding what is going on.. Ok got it. Thanks for the clarification @zufuliu. I thought Notepad2 was another name for Notepad++ since the '2' could denote the '++'. I did not realize they were two different programs.\nSo if its possible to get proper folding of tab indentations on all levels for Python in Notepad++ then who would do it?. So i guess the only thing i can do is just hope and wait. It could be a while if ever.. Wow that was fast @zufuliu. Amazing stuff! Thank you.\nSo what happens now? Do i just wait for the developer(s) to see if they pick it up and implement it in a future release? Would they notify us if they are going to pick it up? And how long would it take to be implemented if it is implemented?. I'll take the binary from you @zufuliu.\nBut what exactly is the binary? Is it the same executable file found on the Notepad++ website or something else?. @sasumner thanks for the info. I will just wait and see if @zufuliu decides to share the binary. If he does then great, if he doesn't then i will just be patient and hope.. Ok thanks @zufuliu. I will follow your instructions to see if it works. But i do have one question before proceeding. Where do i paste the code when i open notepadPlus.vcxproj?\nEDIT: Never mind i just realized that you had a section of the code and the entire code as well and what i have to do is simply copy the entire code and then change the v140_xp to v141.\nSo i will give it a try.\nThanks again.. Ok thanks a lot @zufuliu. I will also come here and let you know if it works out on my system just for confirmation.. @zufuliu sorry to bother you again, but i am unable to unzip the files with WinRar. I get the message: Unknown method in bin\\file names...\nAfter the operation i only get an empty bin folder.\nEDIT: let me try it with another zip program.\nEDIT2: Ok so it was a WinRar problem. I got it to work with 7ZIP.\nSorry for the trouble and thank you so very much once again.. Everything works like a charm @zufuliu. Thanks again for the coding. You are awesome.. I would like to mention that the proper folding works for all tab only indentation languages such as  Python, Matlab, Nimrod, Coffee Crisp, and Visual Basic.. On a side note, if anyone out there is interested, to remove the horizontal lines when folding, you can download and use the LuaScript plugin and paste the following code into the startup script:\neditor1.FoldFlags = 0\n. @LordNyriox Thanks for the info and the link.. Because i tried replying to issue #1898 and did not see the thread re-posted. My apologies if i have caused any offence. But my thinking was that if the original thread doesn't get re-posted then it doesn't get noticed and the issue is left unresolved.. Ok so the folding by level applies to spaces and not tabs. That is, each space is a level. This of course is not proper since spaces are too close together.\nWould this be an easy fix such as simply re-coding the feature to use tabs or 4 spaces instead of one space or is it a more difficult undertaking that would require too much work?\nFurthermore, is there as script that can fix this problem?. Thanks for the clarification @sasumner. I tried reading #1898 but couldn't fully understand it due to my ignorance.\nFor anyone reading this post just discard it and refer to #1898 from now on. Sorry for the mixup.. ",

Also note that there is no article in the label for the newly added option \"for current tab\".

I pasted your parser in functionList.xml and reloaded Notepad++ version 7.1. It did not help unfortunately.\n. I edited #2. Then I found another functionList.xml in %AppData%\\Roaming\\Notepad++\\ and edited that as well. Still no luck.\n. It doesn't look like I can attach a .php file. But try one with the following content:\n\n\n<pstatic function alpha($arg)\n{\n        return true;\n} \n?>\n. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n\n|   To learn how to make your own language

I'm almost sure the behaviour I am advocating was at one time the behaviour of Notepad++.\nConsider that the behaviour I am advocating has the following benefit: if I have a single line of text (as for example, if I had copy & pasted from some other source) then if I want to position the cursor somewhere within the line, I don't have to pay great attention to the vertical position I click at to make sure it is \"on the correct line\" - I just have to click somewhere that is correct horizontally, which is what I'm naturally concentrating on since there is only one line of text. With the present behaviour, if I click slightly too low the cursor moves to the end of the line instead of where I meant it to go to. This is especially annoying if the line of text is long and I have word wrap turned off, as it causes the window to scroll horizontally, forcing me to scroll back to where I wanted to be.\nConsider also that if the user really wants to reach the end of the document, they have alternative ways of doing that (for example they can press Ctrl+End)..

    "d0vgan": "If I was the topic starter, I would edit the initial post to make it more kind and respectful.\nI don't know why, but sometimes users feel free to demand something from an open source developer - as if the developer owes to them. But does an open source developer really owes to any user of his free product? I don't think so.\nApart from that, some of the proposals above look really worthwhile.\n. Looks like e.g. Shift+A (capital A) will be a valid shortcut after this change. Is it intentional?. The solution with 10.0.10586.0 does not work with Visual Studio 2015 at all because 10.0.10586.0 is not available in it!\nI believe it will work when Visual Studio 2017 or additional SDK is installed, but, unfortunately, not with the original Visual Studio 2015.. Actually, why not make this behavior optional? I mean, basing on this change, introduce a new option e.g. \"WinXP-compatible file status\" in the Settings dialog. And this option will alter the behavior of the function generic_stat. What do you think?\n(Though it will probably mean the generic_stat function will need an additional argument e.g. isWinXPCompatible.). OK, I've rebased the changes, plus now they are only for Windows XP (and 2000/2003 if someone succeds to compile Notepad++ under it.).. Updated according to the review comments: now using NppParameters::getInstance()->getWinVersion().. Rebased against the master after handling the comments. Ready to merge, I suppose.. I'd prefer to use BufferID rather than Pos. Please look at the existing messages such as NPPM_RELOADBUFFERID, NPPM_GETBUFFERENCODING and so on - they all use BufferID. And the NPPN_* notifications use BufferID as well.. And I'd propose to use the message names of NPPM_ISBUFFERDIRTY and NPPM_ISBUFFERREADONLY.\nAlso, I believe that NPPM_ISBUFFERDIRTY can be used to get the both \"dirty\" and \"modified\" state by returning e.g. 1 (\"dirty\") or 2 (\"modified\").. Agree, NPPM_GETBUFFERSTATUS makes sense. I assume there will be bit flags e.g.\nBUFSTAT_READONLY = 0x01,\nBUFSTAT_MODIFIED = 0x02,\nBUFSTAT_LOADEDDIRTY = 0x03.\nI've proposed a name BUFSTAT_LOADEDDIRTY for easier distinguishing between a file being modified while editing it and file being loaded \"dirty\" from the session snapshot.. Oops, surely I mean:\nBUFSTAT_LOADEDDIRTY = 0x04 \nas the NPPM_GETBUFFERSTATUS is expected to return the combination of these bit flags according to the current buffer's (file) status.. Looks good to me, except for redundant == true in the conditions.. Agree, Yuni::Mutex could be used instead. In such case I'll add a new class Yuni::MutexLockerEx that will include the m_bLocked member and additional methods Lock and Unlock - similar to CComCritSecLock.. @MAPJe71, please look at the implementation of Yuni::MutexLocker and then re-read my previous comment :) This is because of the following line in CThreadSafeQueue::push :\nlock.Unlock();\nSo it's kind of lock_guard with additional manual methods Lock and Unlock.\n. @MAPJe71,\nI bet you've already noticed what's wrong with that code.\nSurely, it's this situation:\n~~~\n{\n    Yuni::MutexLocker lock(m_Mutex); //<-- auto lock (RAII)\n    m_Mutex.unlock(); //<-- manual unlock\n} //<-- auto unlock - shit, unlocked twice!\n~~~. I'd rather propose to have 2 classes: MutexLocker and MutexLockerEx, without inheritance.\nHere is why:\n1) MutexLockerEx will have an additional bool member variable (see the proposed CCriticalSectionLock implementation), which is simply not needed for a lightweight MutexLocker.\n2) MutexLockerEx will have an additional argument in the constructor (see the proposed CCriticalSectionLock implementation), which is simply not needed for a lightweight MutexLocker.. OK, guys - no additional classes now. Just a little more thinking and a little bit more braces :). Now I believe it's good enough.. Wow, so I'm not the first one to propose this!\nAs for std::mutex, it's better with regards to C++ standard, however it has some overhead comparing to Critical Section (which is used by Yuni::Mutex).\nAnyway, both solutions will work.. rebased + now everything in 1 commit. Come on, why these ATL things are still here?\n\"Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity\"!. I used to think that it's me who is conservative and not fast - now I see I'm not alone :). After some thinking, I think I vote for chcg's patch:\nchcg/notepad-plus-plus@463bdc5#diff-5b536d07367d39b369aea9582ff0fe9d\nIt uses the standard STL's std::mutex - and it is better than relying on thirdparty's Yuni::MutexLocker, which additionally needs to be consireder to be updated.. +1. Motivation:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/15835/find-result-window-s-current-active-line-colour. The intention was: if GetFileAttributes returns INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES, we don't even call CreateFile. These are two different functions, so checking results of both sounds logical, no?. As https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Permission-Bits.html says:\nS_IEXEC : Execute (for ordinary files) or search (for directories) permission bit for the owner of the file. A very intuitive class, with its implementation quite similar to ATL's CComAutoCriticalSection. (Actually, there is nothing \"Com\" in it.). The implementation is quite similar to ATL's CComCritSecLock.. ",

However, the shortcuts are the items in this list.\nUnfortunately, the name of such an item is not useable per se either because it is just all items in succession, prepended by the grid coordinates.\nSo it is something like:\nu'000-001 | Name'\n(recently, there has been added a category this would be a '003' as the second number).\nI can essentially redirect the focus to those items and the user can navigate around with up/down arrow.\nBut note that it goes actually from left to right and then top to bottom and not down by rows.\nThus, you'll hear:\n001-001 New\n001-002 'Ctrl N'\n'001-003 'File'\nWhat's worse, it is reported that this item is selected and if you move to 'modify' the shortcut won't appear but rather the first one instead.\nDragging the mouse to this item and clicking does not help a lot because the item location is wrongly reported.\nAnyway, I would be glad if this could be addressed, particularly since NVDA recommends Notepad++ for e.g add-on development.\nBest\nRJ\n.

It's present in several applications I use, and it's annoying not to have it in npp (which I use extensively throughout the day)...\nMaybe some pictures will help explain what we mean...\nIn all apps mentioned below (as in Notepad++), when I select (of Find) some text, all occurrences of the same text are highlighted. This is very helpful to visualize where the same text is used on the current page. However, if some occurrences are outside of the current view (one has to scroll up or down to see them), there's no way to know about it in Notepad++.\nHere's SQL Developer:\n\nHere's Visual Studio Code:\n\nHere's Google Chrome:\n\nAll of these display a (for lack of better term) \"match map\" (see the red rectangles on the right of each picture), making it easier to see where other occurrences are.\n. @sasumner ,\nThank you very much.

It's OK to move it to the 1st position too (vs. turning it off).. @sasumner ,\nI see. I wouldn't know how to find out what N++ is using to display the vertical edge...\nOn your suggestion about toggling the vertical edge between \"now\" and \"normal\", I created another script to set back to \"normal\":\neditor.setEdgeColumn(120)\nNow I need to map these 2 scripts to individual key-combinations/shortcuts (otherwise it's even more work than in my initial workaround ;-). I checked \"Plugin commands\" tab under \"Shortcut mapper\" window, but found no options for individual scripts. Any suggestions?\nAgain, thank you for your time and help.. @sasumner ,\nThank you so much. This is perfect. I now have Ctrl+Alt+E for setting vertical edge at the current cursor position, and Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E for setting it to \"normal\" (in case someone looks for a \"good\" key combination).

Columns to display could be chosen from a list in a new dialog which will pop up after right click on bar with column's name.\n. I agree that Drag&Drop is unusable when multiline is enabled. In current implementation tab is moved during mouse move  and row with selected tub must always be a bottom row. This two properties makes that when you drag item between rows then dragged item will move to other row and whole row will go down so cursor will point to different place than dragged item.  I see two possible fix for this:\n1. Do not move row with selected item. I looked for such property in TabControl but I couldn't find anything so I'm not sure if it is possible with current implementation of TabBar.\n2. Change implementation of Drag&Drop : tab hit by cursor during dragging will be marked as target and dragged tab will be moved only once at the end of Drag&Drop.\nI found in code that currently tab is moved by shifting. In my opinion copy of moved item should be inserted on the proper position and moved item should be deleted from original position. This will have same effect with less operations.\nAlso I think that in single line mode during Drag&Drop when cursor is to the left or right from tab  then TabBar should move to left or right.\nIn v6.9.2 you can move tab bar with scroll instead of clicking arrows.\nEdit: Sorry, It is not available on v6.9.2.

But original parser can't parse it in too:\n\n. I have a suggestion: let introduce a simple and obvious way to treat with nested function and classes. \nIt needs to change functionList feature architecture to define subclasses and internal functions. It should be done in a notepad++ code side. Actually there are nested functions in Pascal/Delphi, C# 7.0 and many other languages.  It needs to have an entity like nestedClassRange, nestedFunction. And the product should search this objects \"in-functions\" and \"in-classes\" founded in the first level of file preprocessing. \nOr it could be done by introducing special flags in the parser structure like AllowNestedClasses=\"true\", AllowNestedFunctions=\"true\". And notepad++ would treat source file according to that flags. \nIndeed it is simpler to make a general solution in C++, than make complex, dreadful and bug-prone regular expressions in each case. I'm not a specialist in the Formal grammar, but I know that regular expressions could not be apply as a parsing method for a number of cases such as XML/HTML e.t.c.\nAlso, it is possible to implement some convenient parser-language as auxiliary alternative alongside with legacy and convenient in some cases regexes. TBD: example of special lang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n . Yes, I understand the seriousness of change. Yes I can provide functionality with auto-tests and also, I plan to make just an alternative method of language elements parsing which will be live alongside with a current implementation.

Similarly, there could be a radio selection for \"auto-indent with same whitespace as previous line\", \"auto-indent with spaces\", and \"auto-indent with tabs\".

    "treyharris": "I don't know how OpenType rendering works on Windows, but from work on Mac and Linux I can say that this (standard weight of Fira Code and Iosevka works, nonstandard weights do not) is the expected (and arguably correct) behavior.\nIn OpenType you specify weight not through font selection but through OpenType variations. Ligatures, too, are supported not through glyph selection (which would require Notepad++ to be aware that \"->\" becomes the \u2192 ligature, etc.) but through glyph variation.\nOnce you use a non-base weight directly via font selection rather than through variation, you've signaled that you're not using OpenType features (correctly) anyway, so the font doesn't enable them.\nSo, the solution if you want Fira Code Bold to be your default is to click the \"Bold\" checkbox in your Style Settings. (Ligatures are preserved in boldface and bold italic text; if you've done the SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE workaround above, you can check this for yourself, by checking Bold in your styles with plain Fira Code or Iosevka and not Light/Bold as your base font. Fira Code Retina is also a base font containing ligatures, bold weight and oblique (italic) variants, so it also works.)\nThere's no \"Light\" style checkbox, so there's no way to get that unfortunately, but the correct solution there is for Notepad++ to offer weight selection. The problem is that many (most) coding fonts do not have a Light variant, so the checkbox would do nothing in those cases.\nI don't know what, if anything, is lost by making use of the SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE. But if the answer is nothing, it should probably be enabled by default.. @dail8859 Then should this issue be closed? If using LuaScript is sufficient, then you can get ligatures and you can get weights, so Notepad++ \"has ligature support\".\nBut if using LuaScript isn't sufficient to consider the issue closed, then my point stands\u2014UI is needed or, if Light is not to be provided and it causes no other issues, SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE should be set by default.. @dail8859 \u2014 thanks. I appreciate the technical question, so I just did a little research into Scintilla.\nI checked the Scintilla bug tracker for references to SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE, and there were only a few, none of whose responses discouraged use of it and some of which suggested using it.\nAccording to the docs:\n\nThe technology property allows choosing between different drawing APIs and options. On most platforms, the only choice is\u00a0SC_TECHNOLOGY_DEFAULT\u00a0(0). On Windows Vista or later,\u00a0SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE\u00a0(1),\u00a0SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITERETAIN\u00a0(2), or\u00a0SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITEDC\u00a0(3) can be chosen to use the Direct2D and DirectWrite APIs for higher quality antialiased drawing.\u00a0SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITERETAIN\u00a0differs from\u00a0SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE\u00a0by requesting that the frame is retained after being presented which may prevent drawing failures on some cards and drivers.\u00a0SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITEDC\u00a0differs from\u00a0SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE\u00a0by using DirectWrite to draw into a GDI DC. Since Direct2D buffers drawing, Scintilla's buffering can be turned off with\u00a0SCI_SETBUFFEREDDRAW(0).\n\nSo: Scintilla doesn't make it the default because it needed to be unset on non-Windows and on pre-Vista versions of Windows, and it would break downstream clients of the API to make 1 the default now.\nThat being the case, it sounds like SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE should always be used by Notepad++ on Windows Vista or later, perhaps with an option to disable.\n\nBy the way, on another note in what I wrote earlier: the difference between Fira Code and Fira Code Retina is that the latter simply has slightly increased weight across the entire spectrum. IOW, the Fira Code Retina 400 weight (\"Normal\", \"Regular\", or \"Book\") is closer to the Fira Code 500 weight (\"Medium\"), the Fire Code 400 weight is closer to Fira Code Retina's 300 (\"Light\"), and so on. (This is to address the reason many people set a Bold font as their default in the first place: fixed-width text on Retina displays tend to look thinner, particularly for monospaced text mixed with proportional text, like SC_TECHNOLOGY_DIRECTWRITE here.).

    "MojaveWastelander": "Thanks for feedback, I'll look into fixing detected issues.\n. Hello, what do you mean by \"bookmarks are always affected\"? I used a test file and set some bookmarks, then I made a few searches and closed the window, all bookmarks remained unchanged and marks were removed. Regarding replace panel is need to remove the check in code. There is also a bug when a search is done in one document and then switching to another one does not clear marks in previous document.\n. The problem was with the ProcessOperation I was using, ProcessMarkAll was using _doMarkLine setting, I switched to ProcessMarkAll_IncSearch which just marks specific ranges and uses  SCE_UNIVERSAL_FOUND_STYLE_INC. Regarding direction it actually is searching whole document by setting SCI_SETCURRENTPOS to 0.\n. Yes and yes, I'll look into it. Thanks for feedback.\n. Seems to be fixed now, took longer to find what was causing the second issue than to fix it. The question now is when to save or to save in general quick search queries? Right now when quick search is enabled nothing that is written in the search box is saved.\n. Regarding regex search I'm using search methods provided by n++, so \"quick find\" search is the same as default search. On version that I develop on there doesn't seem to be issues with regex search, I guess it was some issue in previous version.\nFrom what I seen marking only matches on the current view is possible.\n\"enabled by default\" is more of a testing state, when feature will be more polished it will be disabled by default.\n. Hello, I disabled the option when search dialog is \"closed\", so all external search methods should not be affected by it.\n. Hello, I made those fixes at work computer, but I when I tried to commit them there was one commit on github that I didn't pulled before making those fixes, so I merged those commits.\n. Initially the idea was to add this functionality to incremental search (it makes more sense for it to be there), but I left it on find for testing purposes (as it had all checkboxes and features available and easily accessible). One of main differences from incremental search is that search is done in current view, thus typing search query is fast no matter how big file is (it was one of issues mentioned before). Main idea is that incremental search is incomplete feature-wise and it could use some ideas that I implemented.\n. The issue is not with N++ but with Windows default open file/directory dialog that does not support forward slashes (while Windows in general support them). Is need to make an user-defined open file dialog that would parse slashes properly. . Yes, it should not depend on isEnable argument as it should be visible on search and replace tabs, I'll add a comment.\n. This line was generated by ResEdit and I didn't looked what is the difference between using syntax with CONTROL, I guess I should use it as well for consistency.\n. ",

Having a special setting to remove autofill wouldn't save you a single keystroke in this scenario.\n- If you specifically need to repeat the previous search while you have another chunk of text highlighted (which seems odd, given that the search is going to discard your current highlighting, but let's roll with it), pressing the Down arrow scrolls through your search history, so you can get to the last search you performed with one keystroke.\n.

I then went to the profile's backup folder and opened the session files from there. One of these files showed all nulls. I suspect it was the file that I had been working on before the system froze up, but I cannot be sure.

Typing block closing delimiters shouldn't really be necessary given that they must always be present in certain situations.. That was what I was suggesting. In cases I was thinking of, knowing the filename doesn't tell you anything useful because you're editing a temporary file with a meaningless name.\nIt's a nice to have.. Just the tab it's opened in if that is possible.. Adding to this the auto insert should be able to do more than inserting a single character. For languages with block closing delimiters, these should be able to be inserted automatically. EditPlus can do this.\nIn my main language \"then\" must always follow \"if\". Why would you want to type it? Similarly with the \"endif;\" and indent of the intervening line.. Note also bash which requires \"then\" and \"fi\" after an \"if\" and \"do\" and \"done\" after a while, until or for.. Adding to this, when I used EditPlus autocomplete also provided functionality like this:\ntype \"if \", you could tell it to insert this in its place:\nif \\ then\n\\\nendif;\nIf you had this you would wonder why Python removed the block closing delimiters!. Oh actually, can't you edit the .xml under API/plugin or similar for \\.xml? @batata004 . In some subdirectory of the Notepad++ directory, there will be an xml file for that language. Let's say we are talking about html. Look for a file called html.xml. IIRC it is under API\\plugins or plugins\\API. I'm also unsure of the singular vs plural.\nIf you add the =\"\" to the style section of that file it would add it.. Not any that I am aware of.\n. Looks like there are a couple of plugins which do achieve it. Got it working with finger text. \nClose issue? . ",

For example if I have a list of keywords containing Janice and JJAbrams when I type J the list will display like:\nJJAbrams\nJanice\nIt seems that the first letter is not ignoring case so if I type the lower case \"j\" I don't get the dialog at all.\nBut if I type the upper case \"J\" will still let me type Janice without the Auto complete dialog disappearing.  But if my autocomplete keyword list contains the additionalWordChar the dialog will close and not let me type the 2nd term.  For example if keywords are object.JJAbrams and object.Janice once I type the \"a\" in object.Janice the autoComplete dialog goes away.\n. I was able to do some testing with this today and it does solve my problem.  I was using what  @anil-shrestha did without the space character logic.  It looks like the issue was closed because of the space logic but would it be possible to submit the change with just the ignore case sorting and comparing?

I just reproduced it on clean minimalistic insatll:\nNotepad++ v7.1   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Oct 15 2016 - 23:30:30\nPath : C:\\Programs\\npp.7.1.bin.minimalist\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : ON\nOS : Windows 10\nPlugins : none\n. @cmeriaux It's not config related. I renamed appdata folder with configs just in case when tried on clean minimalistic install. And it's my understanding it was not used anyway becouse of:\nLocal Conf mode : ON\n. @cmeriaux Actually it's strange that you can't reproduce it. I found exact commit for this functionality:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/d6081a5f3785fe0565900fc4c7f6ce1a78e5c6ec\n@donho Please consider adding back old functionality (ability to copy with all details provided in Find Result dialog). It was very convinient. May be it should be added as additional command.\n. @cmeriaux Ctrl+C doesn't work at all in Find Result dialog. I mentioned it in step 2 in steps to reproduce.\n. @cmeriaux  Thanks! Indeed - Ctrl+C is working on clean install. I found a culprit that broke Ctrl+C inside Find Result dialog - https://github.com/kbilsted/NppPluginCutNCopyLine\n. It's a duplicate of #335\n. @cmeriaux No. Matching logic for exclude is the same as for 'include' filters and applied only for file name (only file name is provided to matchInList method)\nThough it's not hard to provide full file path for matching but it will change matching behavior. For instance:\n\"C*.cs\" pattern with file name matched means all files that starts with \"C\" and have .cs extension, like Class.cs\nBut with file path matched it means all .cs files form disc C, like c:\\any.cs\n. I think in theory it's possible to keep consistent behavior by parsing pattern for directory separator '\\'  and if it's present match full path and keep old behavior otherwise (match only filename). But I'm not sure if it's worth the effort.\n. Ok I will try to implement directory matching.\nBut I would say that directory matching  is out of scope of this pull request. I think both inputs (Filters and Exclude Filters) matching behavior should be consistent thush this new logic should be applied for both filters. So it's more a general improvement in filter matching.\n. Made small fix in PR - empty \"Exclude Filters\" with non-empty history stays empty on N++ restart\n@donho Could you please comment if you think this feature is not needed or you have some other concerns.\nMaybe additional combo box is not needed at all - exclude patterns can be provided right inside Filters. For instance after \"|\" separator:\n*.* | .pdb; .dll\nUpdate I decided to go this way and get rid of exclude filters edit box.\n. I will create another pull request (I want to put this feature in another branch). @donho Text is clipped for active tab. I've already uploaded example here:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/e1125f0bbc6632f037c7511368c01e55bfaa447e#commitcomment-21159220. It helps you to find exact position in the string of each match by clicking on each result.\nWhat is expected behavior on click with you suggested fix - select only first match?. @vlakoff It's seems that strange behavior is \"by design\" in WinApi for combo boxes on resize. Text is selected only if it's present in combo box list items.  I'll see what can I do about it.. @MAPJe71 With  version 6.6.9 it's working without any plugins installed.  Doesn't it mean that something get broken in later builds?. I tracked it down to the following commit (ironically it's chevron fix commit):\n https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/659a9387350fbb3ea9b5a5fbdf9d1f97a49047a0\nThe problem code:\n```\nif _MSC_VER > 1400 // MS Compiler > VS 2005\ndefine REBARBAND_SIZE REBARBANDINFO_V3_SIZE\nelse\ndefine REBARBAND_SIZE sizeof(REBARBANDINFO)\nendif\n```\nIt seems this code got broken after migration to VS >= 2013.\nChevron is back if I change it to:\n#define REBARBAND_SIZE sizeof(REBARBANDINFO)\n. @donho Done. I've made changes you requested. Let me know if you think anything else needs to be done.. @hppavilion1  Define \"with enough lines to trigger a scrollbar but not be extraordinarily long\". How long your lines?  Can you reproduce the problem with empty lines?  Can you reproduce it with \"Word Wrap\" enabled/disabled? If you have document where problem is 100% reproducible - attach it.\nAlso enable \"Display Line Numbers\" (Preferences -> Editing) so you can check what line number position can't be saved.. You can search in opposite direction via Shift+Enter from Find Window dialog.. @vlakoff  No. Active selection remains. Fix is the following:\nFor each combo-box clear selection after resizing if there is no selection before resizing (endSelection == 0 - means no selection before resizing). @vlakoff  I don't think you understand correctly. Logic I described is executed for each combo-box. Only partial selection is lost - as active edit box is fully selected by resize (it could also be fixed but I don't see importance of it - we lose any partial selection on any focus change):\n\n. @donho You just need to open some really big binary file and try to find all spaces in it.\nHere is I prepared 120Mb zip bomb zipped to 640Kb :) . You can try to unzip it and open BigFile.txt and try to find all \"1\" in it.\n120MbBigFile.zip\n. @donho, @arnowelzel It's doable for dialogs by adding  DS_MODALFRAME instead of WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW.\nFor instance for preference.rc:\nC#\nIDD_PREFERENCE_BOX DIALOGEX 0, 0, 560, 220\nSTYLE DS_SETFONT | DS_MODALFRAME | DS_FIXEDSYS | WS_POPUP | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU\nEXSTYLE WS_EX_WINDOWEDGE\nWill give us the following dialog (Win 10):\n\nand with go to dialog:\nC#\nIDD_GOLINE DIALOGEX 26, 41, 261, 88\nSTYLE DS_SETFONT | DS_MODALFRAME | DS_FIXEDSYS | WS_POPUP | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU\nEXSTYLE WS_EX_WINDOWEDGE\n\n. @arnowelzel Sorry but did you check your words before posting? I do make some basic checks before suggesting anything - resize and non-modal behavior are not affected in any way by DS_MODALFRAME (both cases were checked on FindReplace dialog). Where did you get it? The only thing I see in MSDN:\n\nCreates a dialog box with a modal dialog-box frame that can be combined with a title bar and window menu by specifying the WS_CAPTION and WS_SYSMENU styles.\n\nNothing about modal dialog behavior - it's only about modal dialog frame.. @arnowelzel Why are you referencing/suggesting UI style guidelines to me? The only thing I wrote is about actual implementation of behavior requested by donho. If it doesn't work  I'm interested to know why. The only helpful information from your post which explains at least what you meant by \"DS_MODALFRAME can not be combined with WS_THICKFRAME\":\n\nThe resource editor of Visual Studio does not allow to combine DS_MODALFRAME and WS_THINKFRAME . Suggested fix in #3416 \n@irgendsontyp To reproduce it you need to have text saved in combo box list items.. If the only thing that needs to be changed is  \"Platform Toolset\" then I think separate project is an overkill for VS 2017. I think it's better to adjust existing vs2015 project to calculate proper \"Platform Toolset\". I don't have VS 2017 but I prepared prototype for such project:\n\nnotepadPlus.vs2015.vcxproj.zip\nCould you please check if it works with VS 2017 (with installed XP support)?. I'm not saying that you shouldn't use it. But why to force it? Adding additional solution is additional burden to support. And what the benefits?. If for VS 2013  it's also only about \"Platform Toolset\" - it's easy doable too (I only have VS 2015 so can't test it). Could you please confirm that my changes work with VS 2017?. Ok. Thanks. If I understand correctly build is failing due to warnings (so you need to disable Treat Warnings as Error flag) That's actually a no go. I will check how can I make it build without warnings.. I don't think it's a proper fix. What if it's some other common separator like \"_\" or \"-\". Or it's simply the end of file name like \"ver2.1.txt\". To me it looks like we don't need to guess extension at all if it's explicitly specified by user. So this auto guess extension should be used only when \"Save as type\"  equals \"All types (*.*)\". . > Yes, &amp; is the url or html entity for the ampersand &.\n\nThis has nothing to do in those language files and probably is some sort of wrong inserted editor stuff.\n\nIt's \"ampersand mnemonics\". I believe you've just killed \"Alt+[Key]\" menu navigation in your languages (maybe only removed hints - access key underline when Alt key is pressed). In any case - if it's strange for you it doesn't mean it's useless.. You should stick to how it was. It's XML specifics - you must encode & as  &amp; in xml. Otherwise it won't be well formatted XML.. @donho  Did you try to compile with latest VS 2017 platform toolset  - v141_xp?. \n. @donho  Did you try your solution with only VS 2017 installed? It won't work as  v140_xp platform toolset is not available. Your solution require to install VS 2015 toolset. . Did you try hitting Ctrl+F without launched Notepad++? And what if you open Find dialog via menu Search -> Find?. Yep.  Pattern search only applies for file names... With your requirements you are better off with some more specialized app. I know for sure that Total Commander can do it.. Is it about this issue? It seems it's fixed in latest VS 2017 platform toolset. So maybe it's better just to upgrade to VS 2017? Also there is some workaround suggested for existing project:\n\nFirst, unload the project by right clicking it and selecting \"Unload Project\". Then right click again and select \"Edit myproject.vcxproj\". The vcxproj is divided into property groups for each configuration. Everywhere that you have \\v141_xp\\ (or any other XP toolset), you can add this tag in the same section: \\10.0.10586.0\\. You can use any SDK version in this section. This issue was fixed in 10.0.10586.0, but I recommend checking the SDK archive (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive), downloading the latest SDK,. I think something wrong with you config.xml  (%appdata%\\Notepad++\\config.xml). Try to rename it and check if problem still exists. Closing preferences window and exiting Notepad++ saves all those settings for me.. But is it really moved as dirty/untitled? From code it looks like it simply opens \"backup\" file instead. Which is quite unexpected for \"dirty file\" case. . Go to Edit menu -> Paste Special -> Paste HTML Content\n\nExplanation:\nClipboard is not empty. There is multiple clipboards in Windows - each one  can be with specific format (one clipboard with HTML content; another with plain text or RTF and so on). By default plain text clipboard is pasted - which is empty in this case.\nIf you try to paste in app that supports multiple clipboards (like Microsoft Word) - formatted text will be pasted as expected.\n. >FYI Notepad++ has dropped Windows XP compatiblity officially.\n@sasumner Where did you get this official statement?\nAnd why  XP platform toolset is still used if support is dropped?\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/63261156623bbc84d271b7727d66c552512395c1/PowerEditor/visual.net/notepadPlus.vcxproj#L30. Please confirm that Save All operation does nothing for unchanged tabs, so it's safe to click it even if some tabs were changed externally.\nAnd what about \"Replace All in All Opened Documents\" operation? Does it mean that with this new behavior replace will be silently applied to old document and external changes are lost on Save All?. > This is behavioral decision here.\n\nIf only file changes detection is enabled, \"Replace All in All Opened Documents\" or \"File all in All opened Doc\" will be performed on current state of all the tab. \n\nBut it's not desired behavior. I want to be informed on changes. And when I do \"Replace All\" I want to be sure that this operation is done on up to date files.\nWith this pr it's either silent tab update or  silent replace in outdated file  - not good.. @SinghRajenM Sounds good! But that makes  \"Do for all\" request relevant again :) . What the point of pTextFind and pTextReplace local variables in the first place? It seems to me that they can be deleted completely - txt2find and txt2replace can be used directly instead. Am I wrong?. Hmm. Wouldn't it be better to make this pTextReplace variable specific for \"extended replace\" branch of code.  So scope and purpose of it is much more clear. Something like:\n```C#\nif (isRegExp)\n{\n    replacedLen = (_ppEditView)->replaceTargetRegExMode(txt2replace);\n}\nelse\n{\n    if (replaceOptions._searchType == FindExtended)\n    {\n        int stringSizeReplace = lstrlen(txt2replace);\n        TCHAR txt2ReplaceExtended = new TCHAR[stringSizeReplace + 1];\n        Searching::convertExtendedToString(txt2replace, txt2ReplaceExtended, stringSizeReplace);\n    replacedLen = (*_ppEditView)->replaceTarget(txt2ReplaceExtended);\n\n    delete[] txt2ReplaceExtended;\n}\nelse\n{\n    replacedLen = (*_ppEditView)->replaceTarget(txt2replace);\n}\n\n}\n. For signed/unsigned mismatch warning go to line 520 below:C#\n// Special extra handling for shortcuts shared by Incremental Find dialog\nif (std::find(incrFindAccIds.begin(), incrFindAccIds.end(), shortcuts[i].getID()) != incrFindAccIds.end())\n```\nshortcuts[i].getID() is unsigned long and  incrFindAccIds was int. And VS 2017 gives us: warning C4389: '==': signed/unsigned mismatch . That makes a dedicated VS 2017 project is useless because v140_xp is available only with VS 2015 installed.  So you won't be able to make a build without VS 2015 installed.. Oh indeed. Thanks. I corrected my previous comment.  But still I think it's safe and better to use minimal required unsigned type here (as we only compare those values). Why to increase memory usage impact? ) . Could you please clarify implications of it?\nI wrote small code snippet to see how type conversion looks and how it affects assembly code for \"==\" operator :\n```C++\n    unsigned int s1 = 1, s2 = 2;\n00174BAE  mov         dword ptr [s1],1\n00174BB5  mov         dword ptr [s2],2\n    unsigned long l1 = 3;\n00174BBC  mov         dword ptr [l1],3\nif (s1 == s2) //UINT AND UINT\n\n00174BC3  mov         eax,dword ptr [s1]\n00174BC6  cmp         eax,dword ptr [s2]\n00174BC9  jne         main+52h (0174BE2h)\n//...\n    if (s1 == l1) //UINT AND ULONG\n00174BE2  mov         eax,dword ptr [s1]\n00174BE5  cmp         eax,dword ptr [l1]\n00174BE8  jne         main+71h (0174C01h)\n//...\nif (l1 == s1) //ULONG AND UINT\n\n00174C01  mov         eax,dword ptr [l1]\n00174C04  cmp         eax,dword ptr [s1]\n00174C07  jne         main+90h (0174C20h)\n//... \n``\nI see no difference whatsoever - so it looks to me we shouldn't bother about safe implicit built-in type conversions. \n**Update** And actually for both types the same type is used in assembly - dword. So I also checked with short and long - assembly is slightly changed but no additional instructions added. So still - no need to bother ). It seems second search is not really needed if first search is successful. So I think it's enough to have just one variable (maybe renamed to sameFile) and just do second search only if first search is failed.\n. It looks like unnecessary check.new` can't return null nowadays.. ",

For the \"Smart Highlight\" style to use less than 100% opacity is inconsistent with how every other style operator works and is confusing and frustrating to the user.  While it is true that full opacity on words highlighted by the Smart Highlight feature could make them difficult to read, that could be true in many other instances other than Smart Highlighting.  For example, using a bright colour for the \"Current line background\" on a dark background with white text would make the current line very hard to read.  The issue in this example isn't a problem with how Notepad++ is applying the colours; it is a style configuration problem.  Similarly, if the Smart Highlighting colour is applied with full opacity, any reading difficulty is a style configuration issue.\nGiven the above, I'd again like to put forth that the Smart Highlight color should be applied at full opacity.\n. > Adding it to the GUI to allow the user to adjust it wouldn't be a bad idea though.\nAdding a slider for the Smart Highlight opacity would solve this perfectly, and wouldn't be a breaking change for existing users.

If you have some sort of problems with DigiCert CA, take your interests in nice offer from Certum CA - they've got special offer for Open Source developers and are also offering SHA256 signing. https://www.certum.eu/certum/cert,offer_en_open_source_cs.xml\nAnd finally, what about \"Check it if you're paranoid.\" label on website?\nGreetings. push\nI can't believe that such trivial and cheap things are such a big problem in our world. No wonder why we have so many security nightmares.. Very interesting point, thank you for it.\n  . I'm sorry, corrected :)\n  . @bughit Of course you are totally right about using GPG.\nI would also point out, that the installer should be at least dual-signed with SHA-1 and SHA-256.\nBut the thing in which I'm really interested is: what is the motivation for people like @donho for not providing such checksums right now.\n\nFree software for doing this exists (for example: md5deep, Power Shell, HashTab or built-in Linux programs).\nIt takes seconds to do this.\nIt can be automated.\nIt doesn't need huge resources.\n\nMankind puts quadrillions of CPU cycles for idiotic things like Aero, Start screen, themes or forced updates, but when it come to really important stuff, they are almost always lazy, have whole bunch of excuses or even don't have a clue why they are doing something. Same thing with SHA-2 family: provided in 2001, commonly used since maybe 2013 where SHA-3 was available since October 2012. Always looking for things that are \"just right\" for now, but without setting up an margin for the future. I really don't know what is going on.. WTF\n@donho I posted the solution in 2017 in this very thread! https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/2524#issuecomment-326769068\nKeePass is using these cert for example.. Yes, I know that, and I prefer to use even SHA-512 and totally drop MD5 and SHA1 hashes. I pointed out the \"dual-sign\" thing with having compatibility with older systems in mind. Windows NT 4.0 through Windows Vista, even if they are no longer supported, they are still used. But then probably the GPG signature would be better.. I guess we are talking about totally different things.\n\nYou are talking about validating those files from the application itself.\nWe are talking about signing the installer files - exe, zip, 7z.\n. > Certum? They are my nightmare:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/17184/remove-code-signing-from-notepad\n\n\n\nDon't know the case, but KeePass is doing fine, I can't remember other projects right now, but I'm sure that I saw them.\n. LibreSSL should also have such thing.\nBut the most important thing is to sign the distribution files and sharing the signature files with the installer/archive. Generate your keypair, post on some keyserver (pgp.mit.edu for example) and sign the files. Kleopatra application is your friend.. Thank you very much!\nI'm really glad that the problem was noticed by you and if you need assistance I'm ready to help you.. Gosh, now when I'm thinking about the whole case I'm surprised that we could not understand each other. I didn't even think that you were talking about signature validation during runtime (which of course is cool). But I thought that when we were talking for example about removal of the \"if you are paranoid\" label on the project's website, then it was obvious that we all assume attaching the signature files. I'm really glad that we finally understand each other :). I know, that's why I said it is cool ;). Back to the Certum thing: why you don't want to just give them your name? Then the CN would look like \"Open Source Developer, Don Ho\".\nLook how KeePass done this. Download executable from here and look up the Digital signature tab.\nAbout GPG: I suggest you to use the 4096 bit key, just like PuTTY does.. Official site + GitHub + MIT Keyserver for start should be enough.. So that's not exactly a problem with Certum from the beginning. Issuing a certificate for some \"body\" that officially doesn't exist is a straight way to lose ability to issue trusted certificates and their motivation is totally understandable.\nSo we ended up in this: distribution files will be signed with GPG, which is all that we wanted.\nYou said that you don't care about \"unverified publisher\" UAC prompt\n\"Too bad for ugly yellow-orange UAC popup while installation\".\nThis problem is wider than just installation.\n1. Imagine that someone needs to run Notepad++ as administrator - he also gets the same message.\n2. You implemented the runtime validation of the components. But when the main executable is not signed, then it can be modified without notice, for example to modify hashes of modules to match the tampered ones. The whole concept of runtime validation is losing it's sense.\n3. Keep in mind that people who are using some kind of software execution control (like Software Restrictions Policies or AppLocker) with the requirement for valid signature will have problems.\n4. AntiVirus software also more trust the singed executables and without them the program will probably end up in some kind of \"Restricted software\" group, which could result for example in some alerts when user wants to read/write some data in his home directory.\nWe are not in Windows XP SP1 era any more.\nI understand that you want to protect your privacy as a person - that's totally fine. But keep in mind that you produce software that is used by a lot (millions?) of people, so it really would be a good idea to add some level of credibility and trust. Again, KeePass, PuTTY, Notepad2, WinSCP, Total Commander authors do it.\nI don't want to force you to do anything, but really trying to resolve the situation. Even if there are people who can sponsor the certificate, then nobody conscious will sign it using his name - after all, you are producing the binaries.\nIf you really don't want to share your identity, then maybe ask DigiCert to donate the certificate again and in repay you will put their logo on the site with some kind of \"Thank you to our sponsor\" page.. I agree with everything you said about CA flaws. The only thing left for us is something like DNS CAA where we assume, that the CA of choice will not make it easy to issue a certificate for already existing body.. 1. Right click on EXE/ZIP -> Kleopatra (or More GPGex options) -> Sign\n2. Publish your public key on site/github/keyserver\n3. Publish created signatures.\n4. Remove MD5 and SHA-1 hashes - they are useless. Instead post SHA-256 and maybe SHA-512.\n5. I suggest to remove the \"check if you are paranoid\" label - it's not helping in increasing security and awareness.. > In Kleopatra there's a command Publish on server... - is it the same thing?\nYes.\nI would suggest to use primarily the pgp.mit.edu since it is one of the oldest and well-known key server.\n\nI don't know any well-known-devs. Is this part is mandatory?\n\nWell, to validate key authenticity people are organizing events named Key Signing Party where participants validates each-other's key hashes. When you don't have such network of people who can reliably confirm that your key is really yours, then I suggest to do the following steps:\n1. Export your public key to the .asc file.\n2. Export your public key to the keyserver.\n3. Put the ASC file on the Notepad++ website.\n4. Put the content of the file (that's your public key) in GitHub profile.\n5. Put the content of the file in reply to this topic.\nThat way, you will publish it in four different places. If you have Twitter for example, then you can also publish it there (or just hash of it, but make sure that it is a SHA-256 hash and you need to also post the key ID).\nWhen somebody wants your key, then he will be able to validate it from those sources. After he imports it to his keyring, he no longer needs to download it again and now is able to validate signatures against your key, which he already has in his local key database (keyring). That's why it is far superior method to just providing checksums - attacker can't change the content of user's local keyring (and if he wants to \"tamper the signature\", then he will be forced to break into all user's computers which have the key - that's obviously infeasible).\n\nHow people under windows verify the signature with signed notepad++.exe ?\n\nAfter user imports your public key for the first time, he need to add some level of trust to it - based on his level of being sure that the key belongs to you. After that he can just simply double-click the signature file - which you provide with every distribution file of the Notepad++ release - and Kleopatra (or GPG or some other PGP-like program) will tell if the signature is correct. This proves that the file has not been tampered since you signed it.\nKeep in mind, that you are not forced to sign every single distribution file. When you for example make checksum files (separate for SHA-256 and SHA-512) then you can only sing those checksum files. When the signature for the checksum file is correct, then we can assume that the file holds values for original (not tampered) distribution file. This is why you need to use the best available, long-term hashes. Their security is crucial to the whole process, especially when we are talking about small chunks of data.\nThis approach is used for example by Debian GNU/Linux distribution, you can see how it's done here.\nThis process can be easily automated and you will be asked for a passphrase to your private key only once during the process.\nAlso keep in mind, that source code packages should also be checksummed and signed.\nIt is also a good idea to use SHA-3 hashes, which we have for almost 7 years.\nJust for the sake of making it clear:\nSHA-2 and SHA-3 are the family of functions. So in point of fact:\nSHA-256 is the SHA-2 256-bit variant which produces the 256-bit long hash.\nSHA-512 is the SHA-2 512-bit variant which produces the 512-bit long hash.\nSo it would be better to call SHA-256 really an SHA-2-256 and SHA-512 the SHA-2-512.\nSHA-3 is exactly the same schema:\nSHA-3-256 variant produces the 256-bit long hash.\nSHA-3-512 variant produces the 256-bit long hash.\n\nDone, it will take effect in few hours.\n\nThank you.\nBy the way:\n1. Which signature algorithm/hash you've selected for your key?\n2. Are you using some good antivirus program on your build machine?\n3. Are you looking towards making builds reproducible?. > Done, it will take effect in few hours.\nEffect: Check it to verify the authenticity of your Notepad++ download.\nNot authenticity, but integrity. Authentication can only be verified with digital signature.. > Which signature algorithm/hash you've selected for your key?\n\nRSA\n\nMaybe I wasn't that clear: I was asking about signature hash algorithm - SHA-256/SHA-512 etc. I see from the attached key that it is SHA-512 and that's nice.\n\nAre you using some good antivirus program on your build machine?\nWhich one do you suggest?\n\nI would suggest Kaspersky products. It should be enough to say that leaked presentations from GHCQ say that those programs are a pain even for them and also Kevin Mitnick said the same in his presentation here.\n\nThey are mostly based on signatures, signatures need to be reguoarily updated because there exist such a tool as packer, defeating signature analysis.\n\nThat was true till about 1995. Norton AntiVirus 5.0 had Bloodhound technology in 1996, which was one of the first technologies which allowed to detect unknown viruses. Since early 2000-s we've got behavioural detection of malware which analyses what software is trying to do on the system.\n\nYou shouldn't use AV, you should use isolation\n\nAV technologies prevented many infections like ransomware, so I would never say that you don't need AV or AV is dead. Now we also have white-list technologies, which when properly implemented are really difficult to bypass.\n\nyou should not allow any unapproved code to gain access to your private key, source code in process or before build and the built binaries before signing. And I feel that backdoors may be problems here, you should not keep your private keys on machines backdoored by hardware or software vendors.\n\nProblem is wider. There are viruses which search for source code files on developer machines and are attaching themselves to those sources, so the resulting binary is infected. Building software for a lot of users is a very complicated task - there should be a dedicated server with ECC memory, private key for signing stored elsewhere, restricted network connection and many, many more rules. Programs like Notepad++ are used not only on home or developer computers, but also on servers, so a problem in such program can have massive consequences.\n\nA malware that rooted your system can install a kernel module protecting it from being removed and/or detected. It is called rootkit. Though they can be detected by a class of tools called \"red pills\" using unforgeable timer, but this is heavy artillery.\n\nThat's why it is critical to not allow such installation and it can be done with mechanisms built in operating system, as well as antivirus behavioral detection. Antivirus should be installed as the first program after system installation to prohibit such situations.\n\nFor better persistence malware can create a bios/uefi module and flash it into bios. For extreme persistence malware can infect peripherials firmwares too. And this technique has been used by malicious actors, according to Kaspersky Lab.\n\nThat's true and that's a new problem we have.\n\nThat way, you will publish it in four different places.\nAll of which are under either NSA or GCHQ jurisdiction.\n\nGood point. I don't know where the hosting server lies, but indeed GitHub, MIT and Twitter are under their jurisdiction.\n\nAre you looking towards making builds reproducible?\nI don't really get your question, could you elaborate it?\n\nWe are living in times where multiprocessing is used on the global scale. That's why the underlying mechanisms of doing the same things may differ. It is especially seen in the software build labs where the same binary could be different even if build on the same machine using the same source code. This is not really a new problem, but it has been noticed on a wider scale not long ago. For more information see this site. > Not for Notepad++ website & its binaries - they are hosted in France.\nWell, now when I'm thinking of it, the jurisdiction of NSA and GHCQ is... the whole world :). > How can I know about signature hash algorithm from kleopatra or gpg comes with git?\nIt should be in key properties. Can't check this right now.\n\nI had some performance issue due to it. I'll give it a try again.\n\nYou should exclude scanning of the Notepad++ build directory and also put it to the \"personal data\" category to prohibit unauthorized changes to files in it. Those features are in paid version, I would recommend the \"Internet Security\" variant.\n\nAll packages will be signed with the private key I generated. I will provide the signature (a detached gpg file) for each released package, and also my public key in asc format on download page. Am I missing somethings ?\n\nThat's fine. In addition:\n1. Remove the MD5 and SHA1 checksums and replace them with SHA-256 and SHA-512. Put them in two separate files - checksums.sha256 and checksums.sha512 - it's easier to validate them. Then put them on the site and GitHub.\n2. Sign the checksum files (checksums.sha256 and checksums.sha512).\n3. Sign source code package.\nI also recommend to:\n1. Enable two-factor authentication on your GitHub profile (if you didn't do that already).\n2. Make \"big\" announcement on site about changed policy regarding packages authentication.\nI also suggest to:\n1. Redesign the download site and put links to the table - it will remove \"label redundancy\" and make them look simpler. You can also use the drop-down list or the group of them.\n2. Move the \"Release notes\" out of the download site.\nFor example:\n32-bit | Installer ; Sig | ZIP ; Sig | 7z ; Sig | Minimalist ; Sig | Checksums ; Sig |\n64-bit | Installer ; Sig | ZIP ; Sig | 7z ; Sig | Minimalist ; Sig | Checksums ; Sig |. OK, I checked them.\nYou haven't signed the packages, you encrypted or probably signed and encrypted them. That's why the resulting files are huge in size. Keep in mind that the digital signature is a small file, often an longer ASCII string, which can be attached to a text document. The resulting file should have .asc or .sig extension. Remember that GPG isn't the only one PGP-like program, so we need to keep compatibility also.\nAbout the download site:\n1. I would change the Authenticity/Integrity label to Integrity & Authenticity validation. For the sake of order of things.\n2. There are no SHA-512 checksums.\n3. There is no signature for source code package.\n4. Keep in mind that you can also sign release notes as text - it's common practice for example in mailling lists, for example here. As you can see, the signature is attached to the end of the message as ASCII string.\n5. Please try the arrangement using table - look how nicely it looks for example here.. @sasumner (which has been fascinating reading, BTW...)\nThank you for this. It's really nice to hear any appreciation when security people do their stuff. It's really hard and sad when nobody notice what has been done, people are often in doubt if what they are doing makes any sense. I'm sure that if more kind words would be said in such situations, then we would feel much more supported and appreciated, which would result in being motivated and more effective.\n@donho \nI've downloaded and checked all of the signatures and everything looks fine.\nI would add are the links to your public key on:\n- GitHub\n- one of the keyservers\nAlso I think it's good idea to put package with source code on the main server, together with binaries. It's the integral part of the project, so I think it should be in one place. And then you can also provide signature for it.. @donho \n\nThank you (and others) very much for the help. I'm kind lucky to get all the assistance from you.\n\nGlad I could help, you can always ask me in the future.\n\nIf yes, could you provide me the link\n\nI think that the only solution is what @bughit suggested.\n\nThe problem is the devs want their codes work quickly, and while everything works fine, the security experts are the balls breakers who impose a lot of restriction to make their implementation\n\nWell, that's the problem in general. I don't work with devs very often, but situation is the same. The point is that things should be done right, not fast - especially in the open source software development.\nThat's why I liked when Debian always released new version \"when it was ready\". That's also why systems like OpenBSD are so secure - correctness is the priority. You can be surprised, but it is also true for Windows Kernel - just familiarize yourself with it's developers point of view.\nI wonder, how you reacted to the CIA issue some time ago.\n@jmichael2497 \n\nafter checking the template, i noticed maybe autocorrect typo \"the integrality of\" > \"the integrity of\"\n\nThat's news for me. I didn't use any auto-correct, but I've always seen the \"integrity\" rather than the other. According to the dictionary, the two of them are correct.\n\ni'm never really as concerned about \"popular\"\n\nVery good point about popular standards and great examples. But keep in mind that ZIP packages are important for cases when you are for example on an clean system and need to quickly extract packages using mechanisms built in the operating system.\n\n(probably forgetting others from a 2018 report)\n\nCould you point me to the report from 2018 which you mentioned? I've always looked to the ENISA reports, but the last one is probably from 2014.\nAnyway, have you noticed that we are on the probably longest issue - in terms of comments - in the whole project's GitHub history? :).

I converted to CTRL (literally) instead of Shift (not sure if case-sensitive or not?). I'm posting all of this to hopefully help someone else out.\nThe only thing I did not get working was increasing the integer did not produce a faster horizontal scroll.\nI wanted to have this run for my shortcut for Notepad++ which uses the following as a batch file (Notepad++.bat for the full file name inside of the Notepad++ directory which I will create a shortcut to and change it's icon):\nCD C:\\MEDIA\\OFFICE\\Notepad++\nstart autohotkey_ctrl_horizontal_scrolling.ahk\nstart notepad++.exe\nI also added the first line which will silence running the script multiple times. I named the file autohotkey_ctrl_horizontal_scrolling.ahk.\n```\nSingleInstance force\nIfWinActive, ahk_class Notepad++\n~CTRL & WheelUp::  ; Scroll left\n  ControlGetFocus, fcontrol, A\n  Loop 64  ; <-- Increase this value to scroll faster.\n    SendMessage, 0x114, 0, 0, %fcontrol%, A  ; 0x114=WM_HSCROLL; 0=SB_LINELEFT\nreturn\n\n~CTRL & WheelDown::  ; Scroll right\n  ControlGetFocus, fcontrol, A\n  Loop 64  ; <-- Increase this value to scroll faster.\n    SendMessage, 0x114, 1, 0, %fcontrol%, A  ; 0x114=WM_HSCROLL; 1=SB_LINERIGHT\nreturn\n\nIfWinActive\n```. You guys just naturally rock. Thank you!. It really should be the modifier key of the user's choice, Control for me, Shift for you..

    "LRWeber": "If you check the box in the Style Configurator that says \"Enable global background color\", it makes for a partial workaround.\nIt won't adopt the entire theme, but it will get rid of the unexpected ugly boxes. Unfortunately, if your custom language styling includes custom background colors to create a sort of highlighted effect, those will be overridden as well.\nThis behavior has to do with how user-defined languages are handled. The User Define Dialog allows you to define some basic, fairly comment elements like folding, comments, keywords, etc. Then you use the Styler to set specific colors/styles for these elements. This is quite different from how the built-in languages are handled; If you open the Style Configurator, you will see it has a Language list, and each language has its own Style list (which may include things like NUMBER, STRING, KEYWORDS, CLASSNAME). The actual appearance is defined for each named Style, which allows themes to intelligently swap out colors and more.\nThe Notepad++ documentation provides some explanations for the current language defining tools:\n\nSome of the 'standard' or 'more common' programming languages are not built with this tool. For example, Batch. And they cannot because they often have very idiosyncratic syntax features which are nearly unique. Making them as something parametrisable like in the User Defined Languages panel seems both unrealistic and unconvenient, as it would lead to an even more complex interface.\nhttp://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/User_Defined_Languages\nNearly every complex language, be it about programming, scripting or other purposes, had its own quirks. This is why it is not realistic to expect User Defined Languages to duplicate the features of most Built-in Languages.\nhttp://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/Limitations_Of_User_Defined_Languages\n\nI do appreciate the simplicity and the intuitive nature of the GUI based User Define Dialog. I agree that duplicating the features of the built-in languages via this panel is \"not realistic\". That can only really be achieved by more advanced users through writing code (Sublime Text's custom syntax definitions are a good example). However, I do think there could be a similar way to assign a named Style to the user defined elements so they can be affected by themes the way the built-in languages are.. Perhaps the Style Configurator could include a Language called \"User Defined\", wherein the Style list would have an entry for each element the User Defined Language currently provides a separate Styler for.. ",
    "Hser": "I know there could be a thousand ways that this could be done and none are likely to be pursued, but in case anyone else relates to this: what I would find useful is two simple checkboxes in each of the Stylers in the User Defined Language interface. The check boxes would allow you to apply the global theme to that background or foreground color. Similar to the \"Enable Global Background Color\" except this makes it more granular.

For me it's a no-go because I use NP++ for files on which I do not have to do a lot of changes (i.e. a files I edit and then forget about). So this means that I have to create separate config for basically every file have to edit.\nOf course this is not such a big issue, but I think implementing this feature would make a lot of people happy :)\nBest regards,\nSvetlin.

Sorry, I said the cursor position was right, but I only thought about the case when I'm already at the start of the line. If the operation is started in the middle of a line, the cursor ends up at the start of the line.\nAnother behaviour that may be worth considering: If I select some text on one line, and leave the cursor at the start of the next line, only the first line will move.

    "richardebrock": "You're right about the initialization delay not being the cause, Ill close this pr and continue investigating.. There are two problems in the code:\n1) I'm neglecting to send the mouse data with the mouse wheel message and the delta data is lost, resulting in the mouse wheel handler always getting the same direction.\n2) With point 1 fixed, there is still the problem that if the mouse is inside the tasklist, the list control is getting the WM_MOUSEWHEEL message from the UI subsystem and then again from the parent, this causes the line selector to move twice. I've implemented a workaround and now it's solved but I'm not sure the workaround is the most elegant way to go.  I'll post another pr once I've got that sorted.. I've found and fixed the win7 problem and confirmed that the updated code works on win8.1 and win10. Ill delete this PR then and submit a new one.. just to clarify: you are referring to the direction of the list scroll in this comment yes?. Sorry about that, didn't realize it happened until after I had uploaded the pr. The direction variable actually has no impact on the scrolling direction other than to set the initial selected item in the list, thereafter it is ignored. In this patch the scroll direction change is handled correctly and I didn't find any issue.. so short answer is yes\n. I haven't tested on win 7 yet, Ill check win 7 and win 8.1 now and then post feedback here.. thanks for the tips. Testing on Win7 shows that if the mouse is outside the task list it jumps 2 items up or down instead of just 1.  So let me fix that up and Ill submit another pr, ill be sure to eliminate the formatting issues as well.. In my Win7 and Win8.1 tests the mouse wheel messages are sent to the control even if the mouse is outside the control whereas on Win10 they stop if you move outside the task list. So it appears to that Win10 handles things slightly differently, and that's what I put the check to only pass the messages on if its on Win10.. ",

I didn\u2019t mean to imply a zoom per document \u2013 would be a nightmare in a MDI\u2026  My suggestion was that a newly created view should (arguably) assume the settings of the current view unless otherwise specified (after-the-fact).  For example, if I am zoomed at 80% in a single main view and spawn a new view (e.g., \u201cClone/Copy to new View\u201d) \u2013 should it not default to 80% (current) rather than 100%?\nRegardless, brilliant product.

Plugins handling has radically changed.\n\nI know plugin handling has changed but there is nothing anywhere that states you must manually update with every release now.  If you notice Daptonic has manually updated to v7.6.2 and it still is not automatically updating to the next release.\nIf automatic updates is not just broken and has been removed then a note stating there is an update available with a link that opens the download page would be very helpful.\nIf automatic update has only been disabled in v7.5.9 because of the plugin change then a note on the main page somewhere stating this would be very helpful since there is also a note stating that \"the next release wont be pushed until it is stable\".  One could then argue that the v7.6.* releases are not stable since they have not been pushed, however they have been and are available from the main download page as the main download. \nSo I am just looking for some insight as to whether or not it is broken or has been disabled.\nThank you!. Please note that by \"fixing\"  this request Notepad++ will be broken for everyone that does not use a projects as a single project but as a container project for multiple items (example: clients) that may have identical files in each.  \nFor example:\nI use Notepad++ for work in which I have projects set up as container projects for Work, Freelance, School, etc.  Within the projects I have many folders (example: clients, class projects, etc.) and each of those folders may have the same script files (example: form scripts, WordPress, stores, JS files, etc.).  Each of these files would be named the same under each folder where they are used.  Under each folder I also have files called Notes, Contact, etc.  This use case scenario keeps a large amount of work organized and easily accessible.\nThis proposed \"bug\" would break this type of use case scenario.  Please do not \"fix\" this as it is not considered a bug for many people that use projects in this type of setup.\nThank you!. > \n\nSo better would be some sort of checking and if adding the same file a popup asks user what to do:\n1. don't add the same filename;\n\n2. add anyway\n\nAs the same filename can have different content.\n\nThis would be a great compromise option between the 2 working styles.  With the option of either a pop up with options or a warning of repeated content there would need to be a way to:\n- deactivate the popup/warning on trigger OR\n- limit how often it appears or triggers\nThis kind of limitation or deactivation would be needed as content systems can have upwards of 20 or more files and having to knock off a warning or select the usage each file would become a hindrance after just a few files.\nThe easiest way to address this might be to make an option in the settings to check for repeat files on add that could be toggled on/off.  This would allow a greater variance of use across the board for all users.\nThank you!. ",

No register file extension tricks, no registry manipulation needed.. Web pages often have quite long titles, so it is reasonably that a browser does not display the full title, only when hovering on the tab. However, filenames (without path) are often quite short, and if they are longer, it very much depends on individual circumstances whether the most significant part is their beginning, or near the end (e.g. in a C programming project, .c and .h files with the same base name may be mixed, and need to be distinguishable).

Thank you :). @donho It's partly done. https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/4620 emulates the /P parameter, not /PT. \nI'm using a Software which uses the command in the windows \"PrintTo\" context menu to convert various file types to pdf by sending them to a virtual PDF printer. The default for textfiles is %SystemRoot%\\system32\\notepad.exe /pt \"%1\" \"%2\" \"%3\" \"%4\".\nSo, I have a use case, and Notepad++ will still not work in this situation. But this feature requires more changes as renaming the existing -quickprint to /P.\nIt would be nice to have support for this feature, but I understand, that the benefit is low compared to the feature in https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/4620, which helps many people to simply replace Notepad.\nI can't implement it myself. So it's up to you, to decide if you decline the second part of the request or add the feature for full command line compatibility with the default Notepad.. I realized, that this is a problem with the two plugins DSpellcheck.dll and NppMenuSearch.dll.\nIf I disable DSpellcheck (as above) or NppMenuSearch, Notepad++ exits fine.\nSee also here: \nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/4062, https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck/issues/135. This issue is fixed with DSpellCheck 1.4.4.0. This problem still happens with Notepad++ 7.5.7 here.... Thank you, but I prefer my Notepad++ tabbed. Even if I have to open the files one by one. . @donho That's because notepad registers file types to run with notepad.exe %1 instead of notepad.exe \"%1\".\nIt's working in Notepad, because Notepad analyzes its command line parameters. If the parameters build a path to an existing file, the parameters will be merged to one file path and the file will be opened.\nAnother issue with Notepad compatibility is printing file from explorer by right click menu. See my issue. I think this must be done in the Notepad++ program logic itself.\nThe registry key above generally leads to the following behavior:\nIf anywhere in Windows notepad.exe is started with command line arguments arg1, arg2, it will lead to the following command line to be executed: \"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\" -z \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe\" arg1 arg2\nYou can't influence the part after -z (therefore -z is used to simply omit the first argument, which is always the path to the Notepad executable). The arguments passed to notepad.exe, will be passed exactly to notepad++.exe instead. . It will probably work in 90% of cases...\nActually I just did some tests:\nnotepad 1 2 /p gives me an error, that the path was not found, while notepad /p 1 2 would print the file \"1 2\" (If it exists, else Notepad asks to create \"1 2.txt\")\nSo, if there is a \"real parameter\", it's in the first argument. (I only know /p and /pt, but any other will also start with a /) \nnotepad 1 2 asks to create a file \"1 2.txt\", so it doesn't even check if the file exists, but simply puts quotes around the arguments (except if the first one is a real parameter).\nAs Notepad++ supports plenty parameters on any position, it's not so easy there. \nYou could optionally make this behavior dependent from the -z switch. As it's probably only used for the special case of replacing Notepad.exe, it could also switch the command line handling to a \"Notepad compatibility mode\".\nActually I'm using a vbs script to make the command line handling, which works great and does the following:\n- throw away the first argument (this is what -z will do)\n- iterate through the arguments\n-- if the argument is /p, add -quickPrint to the future command line and throw the argument away\n-- if the argument contains a space, put it into quotes and add it to the new arguments string (it was already quoted in this case)\n-- if the argument doesn't contain a space, simply add it to the new arguments string\nAfterwards, I test if the complete arguments string is a valid file name. If so, I quote it to have Notepad++ open the file, else Notepad++ a file for each argument.\nI just can't handle Notepad's /PT, as there's no way to tell Notepad++, which printer to use.\n. Personally, I'm a fan of having the choice - speaking parameters in cases where understanding the purpose is more important than the length. And short ones for everyday typing.\nOn Linux for most command line tools, you have  two parameters for one purpose.\nOne to use in a script (better understanding) and one for the command line (for lazy people like me)\nIt's not as you have to type this parameter everyday and you can guess the purpose with one glance in the registry key... So, I'd vote for a long version.\nThe parameters of Notepad++ aren't very consistent, by the way:\nThere are some short parameters, some long parameters and a double dashed help, which doesn't fit at all to the rest.\nMaybe you could also use two parameters\nnotepad++.exe -notepadCompatibility -skipNextArg \nwould work perfectly (please don't call it -skipFirstArg...). Because the parameter causes Notepad++ to skip the next/following argument, not the first one.... /p will be handled in a way:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/4620#issuecomment-407235706. My tests of Notepad's behavior are described here:\nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/4620#issuecomment-406787495. @CookiePLMonster Sounds great, thank you. @donho Yes, \nhttps://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/4620#issuecomment-406787495\ndescribes the behavior of Notepad in Windows 10 1803.. @donho Yes, you need to run the command from an elevated command prompt (changing the registry in HKLM needs admin privileges). Also it needs to be cmd.exe if you use environment variables in this way, the command will fail in PowerShell.\nThe default install location depends on the OS:\nx86 OS/x86 NP++: \"%ProgramFiles%\\Notepad++\\\"\nx86 OS/x64 NP++: won't work\nx64 OS/x86 NP++: \"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Notepad++\\\"\nx64 OS/x64 NP++: ?? If the installer is also 64bit, it probably defaults to \"%ProgramFiles%\\Notepad++\\\", if the installer is x86 it will default to \"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Notepad++\\\"\nThe command line to remove the Debugger value and to restore the default behavior is\nreg delete \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\notepad.exe\" /v \"Debugger\" /f\nThank you for adding this feature @CookiePLMonster . Is Firefox in your path? What Notepad++ does is simply executing firefox file.html.\nEither add your firefox installation folder to the path or modify %AppData%\\Notepad++\\shortcuts.xml and replace firefox &quot;$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)&quot;\nwith <Path to your Firefox>\\firefox.exe &quot;$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)&quot;\n[it's the same for chrome...]. I can second that.\nFirst: %LocalAppData%  is user specific, while %ProgramFiles% is global for all users on the machine. If you want to deploy a new version, manipulating user configuration folders is ugly and leads to problems.\nAlso folders in %UserProfile% are meant for the personal user, not for the admin.\nSecond: %LocalAppData% is for (machine specific) user configuration data, not for binaries. Binaries should be placed in %ProgramFiles% where they are well protected from standard user access (and malware running in default user context).. I made a similar report already in April 2018.

Also tested monitoring IIS log file, also worked.\nI don't think Windows would raise any events because another program is reading the file. I guess how the file is being written could be the cause, if you could provide some details in that way it would be nice.\nSome questions that also could help:\n- Is it a local file or a network file?\n- Is the file being flushed after change?\n- How big is this file?\n```\nnamespace ConsoleApp {\n    class Program {\n        static void Main(string[] args) {\n        using (var sw = new StreamWriter(File.Open(\"log.txt\", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.Read))) {\n\n            while (true) {\n                sw.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString());\n                sw.Flush();\n                Console.ReadLine();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```. I've been able to to reproduce the reload dialog over here. Looks like Buffer::checkFileState is being called regardless Monitoring is enabled or not. \nSince it takes care over file renames and deletions I don't know yet the best way to handle it, but somewhere this old way to check for changes should not be used when Monitoring is active.\n. Just made sure to don't ask for a reload when Monitoring is enabled. Looks right for me. I'm still unable to miss a reload yet.\n```\n            case DOC_MODIFIED:  //ask for reloading\n            {\n                bool autoUpdate = (nppGUI._fileAutoDetection == cdAutoUpdate) || (nppGUI._fileAutoDetection == cdAutoUpdateGo2end);\n                bool isMonitoring = buffer->isMonitoringOn();\n            // Since it is being monitored DOC_NEEDRELOAD is going to handle the change.\n            if (isMonitoring)\n                break;\n\n``. Got it. It is only detecting changes when N++ get focused.CReadChangesRequest::NotificationCompletion` is only being called when N++ is focused. \nIt has something to do with Windows APC (Asynchronous Procedure Calls). I've to dig into how ReadDirectoryChanges is implemented to get a better understanding on why this APC is not delivered right away.\n. After few tests, looks like Windows isn't honoring FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_SIZE or FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_LAST_WRITE correctly if the file writer keep it opened. \nI agree that this feature would be better if N++ could detect changes without being focused. \nAt this point I believe that it would be better to implement an active monitor to detect changes on files just like GNU tail for Windows does. It does it at \nstatic void tail_forever (struct File_spec *f, int nfiles, double sleep_interval) on tail.c.\nWhat do you guys think about that? @donho are you ok with this alternative?\n. Just added to this PR a commit that includes an active file watcher every 250ms. \nCan anyone confirm it is working as expected?. Could someone please confirm that this patch is working as expected? If needed I can provided a compiled version. . @nothingface0 @sawlogs A compiled version can be downloaded here.\nIt is compiled as x86 because I only have boost library compiled as x86 right now, but it is going to work on Win10 x64. \n. @nothingface0 How big are those files causing CPU spikes?. @vdeconinck I didn't get your question. N++ always scroll to the last line when a file change is detected.\n. @nothingface0 N++ reloads then entire buffer when a change is detected, so this CPU spike is the same one caused by first load.. @donho Looks like it is working as expected. . @vdeconinck I agree that we should first have a reliable \"tail -f\" shipped then we can improve it to have more features.\nIMHO, I would just toggle monitoring button as @epalm said. I also think think having a checkbox would just get UI cluttered. \nWe could think of triple state button as well, like: disabled, monitoring always scroll, monitoring don't scroll.

    "vdeconinck": "@donho Any idea when this will be integrated ? Looks like low hanging fruit one-liner, and without it, the \"tail -f\" feature is useless for me (and others :-)). FWIW, my use case is RealTerm - https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/ - which also keeps its capture file open for the whole session. Thx.. I confirm the issue is not solved in my case with Notepad++ v7.5.6 32bit on Win7 32bit.\nA logfile is generated by RealTerm - https://realterm.sourceforge.io/\nNo change is detected in real time, no matter if Monitoring is enabled or not: the view is not refreshed until focusing to another app and back, then the classic prompt appears. \nOn the other hand, I have a GNU tail for Windows (tail (GNU textutils) 2.0 Written by Paul Rubin, David MacKenzie, Ian Lance Taylor, and Jim Meyering. Copyright (C) 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.) installed, which works flawlessly on the same file at the same time:\nSee this video: https://www.screencast.com/t/u0NmshWABAVA\nThanks for your efforts and keep on the good work.. A question while we're at it : does the file scroll when the last line is visible ?\nAnd does the file stay at the same point when it's not ?\n. @jrocha \"always scroll\" is what I'm fearing. If you're looking at a growing logfile, and you want to focus on a specific line that was just added, it's really annoying if the window permanently forces a scroll back to the end as new lines come in.\nSee the behaviour of tail -f in a Windows command prompt : https://www.screencast.com/t/HvcFvOPYe\nOn the other hand, the \"ideal\" behaviour in my view is that the \"automatic scroll\" is only enabled if the view is already at the end and disabled when the view id not at the end.\nFor example, that's how Baretail works - I have no affiliation with baretail, I just happen to use it until I can use N++ for all my text needs - In Baretail, automatic scroll to the end can also be manually selected using a checkbox but I never use it as its very intuitive. See this video https://www.screencast.com/t/phFgd8fcyh\nIDEA IntelliJ behaves exactly the same : https://www.screencast.com/t/bcHJL0y71\nBut OK, that's a separate feature, Let's first make sure the basic tail -f feature works before requesting improvements :-).. The idea is not to toggle the \"follow\" feature, it's to toggle the \"scroll to the end\" one. It's close but not the same. For example, while focusing on a message, you can notice that the scroll thumb has stopped moving, or to the contrary that it is running fast, which is a very useful information.\nMy point is that there is a much more intuitive way than toggling a checkbox : just relying on the scroll position to decide if the incoming changes should refresh the view.\nBut as I said, it's just a nice to have.

If you're looking at a growing logfile, and you want to focus on a specific line that was just added, it's really annoying if the window permanently forces a scroll back to the end as new lines come in.\n\nSee the behaviour of tail -f in a Windows command prompt : https://www.screencast.com/t/HvcFvOPYe\nOn the other hand, the \"ideal\" behaviour in my view is that the \"automatic scroll\" is only enabled if the view is already at the end and disabled when the view id not at the end.\n\nIf you needed to look at a particular line, wouldn't you just turn off the feature (i.e. click the toggle button)? Then when you're done, turn it back on (i.e. click the toggle button again) and it'll scroll to the bottom.\nOr to look at it another way, what's the point of a toggle button and a checkbox?

Sometimes, the examples and the files being edited even have the same names.

In Notepad++'s Hex-Editor plugin I can see \\xC2 character before \\xA7 but in normal Notepad++ editor I don't see any extra character nor does it exists in C# string when I read whole file there. I'm interested in situation because I too battled \u0e22\u0e07 showing up where \u00a7 should be and getting strange git diffs when retyping \u00a7.. Showing subscription window is poor way of alerting a user about a threat (virus, worm, other malware). There is no proof about found threat and as you said after you filled in subscription details the issue disappeared. I think you are seeing Norton 360 Premier bug/\"feature\" first and foremost.. ",

    "vrubleg": "Just several use cases:\n1. We create a new text file using Shift+F4 in Total Commander. It creates a new file and opens it in the Notepad++. But encoding is ANSI.\n2. We create a new file using N++ FTP plugin. But when we open this file, it will be treated as ANSI.\n3. We create a new text file using Explorer's New \u2192 Text Document. But when we open it in Notepad++, it is opened as ANSI, not UTF-8.\nThis bug is really very annoying for people who would like to use UTF-8 by default.. Oh, yeah, it will be a very useful feature. Now I'm making it manually, pressing spaces as many times as needed, but automatic solution would be nice.\nBTW, which plugin implements such behavior? UPD. Answer: it is the TabIndentSpaceAlign plugin.. Unfortunately, TabIndentSpaceAlign is buggy. Sometimes it breaks default behavior of the tab key. We need just \"use spaces instead of tabs if there are other symbols than tabs on the left of the current line\" behavior.\nIt would be nice if these \"smart tabs\" will be implemented natively in the Notepad++.. It has to ignore last chars if all of them are from the list. For example, (http://example.com/), has to skip last ) and , symbols.. In can count opening and closing brackets for catching such situations. But, actually, ( and ) are pretty rare in the URLs. The problem when some unnecessary characters are included into an URL is much more frequent now. I hope, that it will be fixed.. @botmtl, all other modern editors are able to handle it. Probably, it worth to switch to Visual Studio Code. It even has Notepad++ keymap plugin from Microsoft itself, so you can switch easily. The only issue here is \"Chrome-like\" rendering of fonts. For some reason, Chrome always had ugly font smoothing and it is true for Electron-based applications also (it hurts my eyes, that's why I prefer Firefox). But if you are used to Chrome as a browser, I believe you'll be OK about it.. And yeah, if the authors of Notepad++ decide to implement this nice feature, it worths to add that if there is a quote (', \" or ` and a lot of others if you want to support Unicode quotes also) before the link, the same quote after the link should be ignored..

I am 100% sure that I was using intensely one of my UDLs in November. That UDL was created a few years ago, and survived a lot of updates of Notepad++. Yesterday I started to work on my old project again, and noticed that all my UDLs are missing. I have updated Notepad++ recently, that's why I thought that it is caused by the latest update. But probably it happened a bit earlier.. Oh, probably it was caused by disastrous upgrade to v7.6.0.

    "irgendsontyp": "Would it be better to add an option to enable/disable this behavior or remove it completely?. I'd like to try to implement this but it conflicts with a pull request I created some time ago, which has not been reviewed yet: #3487. I modified the options dialog for that PR - which is also neccessary for this issue here. (Is \"this issue here\" correct English?). The code introducing this behaviour is commented with: // Don't touch the following 3 lines, they are cursed !!!.\nAnd indeed, the things that are going on afterwards are really cursed. \nI think I figured out where the core of the problem is: Notepad++ installs a hook for the save dialog. Inside this hook, the window procedure of the dialog is replaced with a custom one. In the custom window procedure, the window message WM_COMMAND with the id IDOK, which is the \"Open\" or \"Save\" button (the button is the same, only the caption is changed depending on whether there's a folder selected in the dialog or not). Inside the custom window procedure, there is a check whether the string in the control for the file name (which can be an edit control or a combo box, depending on the version of Windows) contains an extension or not. If it doesn't, the extension selected in the extensions-combo box is appended. This is done via SetWindowText() for the file name's control. I think this is exactly where the problem is: By calling SetWindowText(), some internal flag seems to switch which causes the dialog to call the \"save routine\" even if a folder is selected in the list view (and thus the button's caption was \"Open\" at the time of clicking it). You can verify this by just commenting out \"PowerEditor/src/WinControls/OpenSaveFileDialog/FileDialog.cpp\", line 311.\nNow I had two ideas to fix this:\n\n\nI assumed that the above mentioned routine for checking whether to call \"save\" or \"open\" is done by listening to some \"text changed\" event of the edit control. So I thought by replacing the edit control's window procedure with a custom one, calling DefWindowProc instead of the original one, when we are adding an extension to the edit control's content would prevent the dialog from calling the \"save\" routine. But I couldn't get SetWindowText to work after having replaced the edit control's window procedure. The new text just didn't appear. Anyway, I think this doesn't work out as I initially expected.\n\n\nI thought we could just focus the list view containing the file names of the currently selected folder after having set the new content (with the extension) of the edit control. By focussing the list view, the internal dialog state would again change to \"open\" and thus clicking the IDOK button wouldn't call the save routine which it would have called due to the changed edit control's content. This solution works if there is a folder selected in the list view. But it doesn't work if there is a file selected. Let me explain this with an example: Open the save dialog. Create and select a file named \"a.txt\" in the list view. Enter \"b.txt\" into the edit control. Click \"Save\". Now the dialog saves (or tries to) the file \"a.txt\" because after having clicked \"Save\", the list view and the item \"a.txt\" are focussed causing the save dialog to assume you want to save the file as \"a.txt\".\n\n\nI have no other ideas at the moment :)\nI hope you can understand what I wrote. I'm not a native English speaker.. @vrubleg, according to your your comment, \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_(2003_film)\" wouldn't be a valid url then? Where did you find the information that the characters you mentioned are not allowed at the end of an url/uri?. I consider this a bug. We could check whether there is a \" \" (space) after the last \".\". Would that be enough? Alternatively we could use WinAPI's PathFindExtension but that exists from Windows 2000 on. But regarding \"PowerEditor/src/Parameters.cpp\", line 851:\nint FileDialog::_dialogFileBoxId = (NppParameters::getInstance())->getWinVersion() < WV_W2K?edt1:cmb13;\nI assume Windows versions < Windows 2000 should also be supported so the API function wouldn't be an option.. See PR #3470 for a possible solution.. Take a look at this stackoverflow post regarding missing windows.h.\nAnd if that's not enough for successfully building, take a look at #3492. The VS project file might work for you.. I'm on Windows 10 64-bit and it works for me, too.\nCan you provide an example file?. As far as I can see, Notepad++'s default file for storing session information is %APPDATA%\\Notepad++\\session.xml. Can you verify that the contents of this file are the same after restarting Windows?. I'd like to take a look at this but I cannot reproduce. I downloaded Notepad++ 7.4.2 32-bit 7-Zip edition here. Neither in this nor the 64-bit version I previously installed via the installer any text within the search dialogs is selected after resizing them. (You're actually talking about resizing the dialogs, aren't you?)\nI am running Windows 10, 64 bit.. As a workaround, which works for me, you can modify the notepadPlus.vs2015.vcxproj by changing \"v140_xp\" to \"v141\" and then try again.. > What if it's some other common separator like \"_\" or \"-\". Or it's simply the end of file name like \"ver2.1.txt\".\nWindows seems to treat everything except spaces after the last \".\" as file extension. You can check by creating a file in Windows Explorer and see the \"Type\" column. For example: I created a file named \"foo._-\" and the \"Type\" column says \"(underscore)--File\" (I couldn't insert an underscore here, so \"(underscore)\" is just a placeholder.)\nver2.1 would indeed be a problem as Notepad++ takes \"1\" as the file extension. (That's what it already does, this was not introduced by my fix.) Unfortunatelly there is no way to perfectly determine the file extension part of a file name because you never know whether there is one at all.\n\nTo me it looks like we don't need to guess extension at all if it's explicitly specified by user. So this auto guess extension should be used only when \"Save as type\" equals \"All types (.)\".\n\nThe extension is guessed for example when the user provides a file name without extension or when the user changes the file type in the drop down menu of Windows' save file dialog. I guess this is done because you want to notify the user about the case when a file already exists. To check for that condition, you have to know the whole file name before saving. So you have to know the extension before the dialog closes.. The problem seems to be that the NPP window running with admin privileges does not receive the command which should be sent by ShowWindow from the non-admin NPP window which is opened through the context menu. I thought it would be enough to enable WM_SHOWWINDOW through ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx, but unfortunately this does not work.\nThe problem could be solved if we sent a WM_USER from the non-admin window to the admin one with an LPARAM or WPARAM set to something like \"NPP_MAXIMIZE_WINDOW\" which could be handled in the main window's window procedure by finally calling ShowWindow and other stuff needed to bring the window to the front.\nWhat do you think?. I was not able to remove those other two commits from the PR. I haven't worked much with git yet. Can someone tell me how to get rid of those commits (c403a06 and 9d40290)?. So should I delete this PR and create a new one, only containing the commit required for the feature?\nEdit: Nevermind, i managed to remove the other commits.. I'm curious when this PR (and my other two ones) will get a review. I'm kinda new to GitHub and those were my first three pull requests at all, so I do not know how much time it takes normally until a PR gets reviewed/merged.\nDoes someone know?. Thanks, I updated the comment! Guess I was not sure whether to say \"the file has changed\", \"the file content has changed\" or \"the file has changed in the file system\" or something else, so I might have decided to just omit the relevant parts of the sentence :).

Notepad++ replacing the text with whatever text is next to my cursor is really annoying, meaning I have to manually type the search text again or paste it in, or select it from the search history if it's there.\nAuto filling and searching for text next to the cursor makes no sense to me. When would anyone want to search for the text your cursor happens to be on? \nAuto filling and searching for selected text could make sense I guess - but only if the Find dialog isn't already open. If you have an open dialog it makes no sense to me to overwrite your current search term. Would be good to be able to turn that off too if you wanted to. If I want to search for some text that I've selected I just copy it, Control+F and then paste it into the search field. \nWorth noting that Windows Notepad (not \"++\") - does this correctly for me. You can leave a Find dialog open and repeatedly search for the same term, whilst editing the text.\nI would like to see (in order of preference):\na) Stop pre-fill if Find dialog already open - ie. 'smart pre-fill' - with an Option to disable that feature too if people don't like it\nb) Stop pre-fill if Find dialog already open - ie.

    "magol": "I support this suggestion to, this is something I regular need to do. . Oh, I did not know that the old PR was still waiting. I have merged the two PR and closed the old PR.  . @donho As I wrote in my initial text, and as @MAPJe71 described so well, today there is a big mix between different indent methods in the source code. Today it's hard to know what to use as it's so different between different files and even the same file.\nI realize it was not that smart to do a big bang update like i did in #3392. But I think it might be good at least to clearly declare what to use so everyone has something to follow. Then we can slowly make the source code more uniform in terms of indentation. That will be a benefit for everyone.. I agree that the logo should be updated to a more modern version. But I think it should be based on the old one. . I also think that the current is good enough. But I'm experiencing it as a bit pixelated, I guess it's only using 16 colors (the old \"standard\").\nSo my suggestion is to continue using the current icon, but use more colors. It is still recognizable, but becomes more beautiful.. @talentlessguy \nDo not worry, I do not take it badly. It's good to be able to discuss. :-)\nI see in you example that the icon actual do have a high resolution version, I should checked it better before I wrote my comment :-)\nI understand exactly what you mean, and actually agree with you.\nBut you can see an icon as a brand logo, and I do not think you should change a branded logo too much. When companies design new brands, they usually base the new brand on the old one, and that's exactly what I mean should be done with the Notepad ++ icon to. People who see the new icon should  recognize the icon as Notepad++, and not as a completely different product.. I searched if there were others with the same idea, and was surprised I could not find any. I must have been blind.. I strongly support this. I agree that it is hard to keep the Swedish translation in sync with the English. \nBut it is, as you say, hard to review. Is it possible to do the sorting in one commit, and all fixes of spelling and inconsistencies in a separat commit (or even a separat PR).. Even when you do your best, it is hard to do it perfekt. It is greate to have someone to review my work.

You've found some embarrassing spelling mistakes I've made, but also improved the language overall.\nYour work on harmonizing the file with the English file will greatly simplify future work with the Swedish translation. However, I found that you missed to sort the strings in the Scintillastag.. @ordtrogen Sorry, I did a mistake when when I did the compare in WinMerge. \nI can confirm that all you work is of great quality :-). @ordtrogen\nThanks for the input.\nI agree that we should be consistent with \"alla\" and \"allt\". But I don't like constructions like \"S\u00f6k alla i alla \u00f6ppna dokument\", I think \"S\u00f6k allt i alla \u00f6ppna dokument\" sound better. \nBut, if you don't agree with me, I can change it to \"alla\" :-). What i don't like is that \"alla\" is used twice in the same  sentence and refering to different things (all string matches and all files).\nBut i can live with it \ud83d\ude0a. @ordtrogen Yes, I was surprised to, but now we got the access keys. Please create a new PR and reference me, so can we continue the discussion :-). I agree that the current translation is not the best \n\"Stilkonfiguration\" is a literal translation, but I think the word is to long.\nMaybe translate it to:\n konfiguration av stil\n konfiguration av utseende\n konfigurera stil\n konfigurera utseende\n. I agree. \"konfigurera stil\" is the best translation :-). @IluvBread You have a point with your objection. But I do not agree that \"Stilkonfiguration\" is easier to read than \"Konfigurera stil\". At a quick lock, I would not understand what \"Stilkonfiguration\" mean, I have to read the whole word to understand what it's all about.\nBut I have no strong opinions about it really, if most people thinks that \"Stilkonfiguration\" is the best, I accept that :-). @donho yes, i approved this \ud83d\ude0a. I saw that it was like so in the English base text. But that may not matter?. @donho I know that you don't like to make formatering changers, and I absolutely understand the motivation. I agree that it is not good to mix regular changes with formatering changes, as it is hard to see the changes that matter. \nThe problem is that the quality of the code slowly deteriorates if it is not allowed to improve the formatting.\nI agree that it is not wise to make big changes at once (which I stupidly tried to do), but it must be allowed to make small improvements in order to at least improve the quality.\nI did not think it was so controversial to at least fix a few simple line feeds, but I restore them now.\nThe reason I want to do this is because it is very difficult to compare the Swedish translation with the English source. It had make it much simpler if I was allowed to do the translation equivalent to the English original.. @donho\nI appreciate that you understand me and am willing to make exceptions to help me. I understand I've annoyed you, and it's absolutely anything I want. It's good that you keep your principles and have high ambitions.\nUnfortunately, I've been on vacation, and I saw you already merged my PR.\nIs it ok if I create a new PR that only sorts the strings and makes the file similar to the English source file?

Another thing that Chrome does which (mostly) addresses the points raised by @Yincognyto and @ke352802081770314 is to show the full tab title when moused over.

This will save the file under the name that I have provided and will \"magically\" change \"All types\" to \"Text files\" prior to saving.\nOther, most likely faster solution is to learn oneself to always type .txt after providing filename and prior to hitting Enter.. You are absolutely correct. This seems to be a bug in \"old\" style of the dialog. Thank you. Closing.\nSummary: Making sure that Settings > Preferences > Default Directory > Use new style save dialog (without file extension feature & Unix style path capacity) option is enabled solves the problem.\nHowever, there's a price to be paid (as always). When \"new\" dialog styles are enabled, Notepad++ defaults \"Save\" and \"Save as\" dialogs to *.* (All types) instead of *.txt and thus forces user to change that every time a new file is being saved or manually type *.txt in file name (or it will be saved in file with no extension). Which can be even more annoying than a problem described in initial bug report.. > @trejder If it is a bug in old style, shouldn't this stay open so it can be fixed?\nYou are probably right. I can reopen this ticket, as you suggest. However, given the fact that #3341, risen by me 1,5 year ago about very similar problem in \"old\" dialog style, wasn't even touched by that time, I seriously doubt if N++ devs are even taking care of such \"cosmetic\" problems..

On my other Windows 10 laptop I do not have this issue at all, on any NP++ version.\nEDIT: actually, I think I found what's causing the changelog file to appear every time you launch NP++. Are you running it from a shortcut? Open the NP++'s properties window from the shortcut itself. You will see that the target field is linking the changelog file. Remove that and you should be good to go.. I can't seem to be able to reproduce the problem. Could you provide your window size along with how many lines do you usually have when this problem occurs? Also post the debug info from the '?' menu.\nWindow size can be found in the config.xml file in %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Notepad++. Go to the line that starts with <GUIConfig name=\"AppPosition\" ... />. Are you double clicking with a mouse or a touchpad? If it's a touchpad, you're not alone; however, this seems to be a Scintilla issue not a NP++ one. I tried multiple Scintilla-based editors and they all have the same problem. I don't recall having this issue few months ago. I assume it's caused either by a Windows 10 update or a Synaptics driver update.. @ahmedhamdy90 I have exactly the same laptop that is suffering from what you had described. Like I said, this is definitely not a Notepad++ issue. Double clicking works fine elsewhere, but on any Scintilla component, behavior is abnormal.. @ahmedhamdy90 That's what I'm saying. Notepad++ uses a text editing component called Scintilla. The issue you are describing seems to be affecting all text editors that use Scintilla as their text editing component.\nYou can download SciTE (editor part of the Scintilla project), or any other Scintilla-based editor such as Notepad2/3, Geany, etc and see for yourself.\nI think it's more wise to report this issue to the developers of Scintilla itself.. @Far0n I can confirm it did solve it for me as well; however, it is only creating a new problem, as you won't be able to double-tap and drag to select anymore. A feature that is much more necessary than not being able to select a word in Scintilla via double-tap.\nGood find nonetheless..

    "arnowelzel": "Ok, it seems there was a confusion about the WS_SYSMENU style. If you just remove that as well, it will not appear any longer. Did you use WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW just to remove the system menu from the dialog windows?. PS: I can do this change as well and check the results. It will just take another day or so, as I'm a bit busy at the moment.. Ok, checked it. No - what you want is not possible.\nIf you want to have a close box, a windows must have WS_SYSMENU, because this IS the close box.\nSo I now understand, why you used the \"toolbar window\" style for all the dialog boxes, since you don't want to have the standard Windows GUI. But please reconsider this: even the Windows explorer uses the regular style for its dialog boxes - WS_SYSMENU but not WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW. So I would consider that the expected and normal behaviour: a normal dialog box has a system menu and a close box and is of course not a \"toolbar window\".\nEdit: Also see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742499(v=vs.85).aspx. Well - there is a reason why the style is named \"DS_MODALFRAME\" - because it is for modal dialog windows and not for non-modal ones.\nNearly all dialog windows in Notepad++ are non-modal - you can just open them and continue to use the editor. A visible system menu icon is the visual indicator for this. Furthermore DS_MODALFRAME can not be combined with WS_THICKFRAME (which is an alias for WS_SIZEBOX) - but some dialog windows in Notepad++ use this to be resizable.\nAs an example: see the Explorer in Windows 10 and open the properties dialog for a selected file or folder. It will also have a system menu icon because it is also non-modal.\nWhat's the problem with the system menu anyway? It is just part of Windows. So why not just use it as intended? If you don't like the icon you should fix the icon to be the right one and not try to use ugly \"workarounds\" to get rid of the standard UI.\n. @bahusoid Yes, know exactly what I'm talking about. Maybe you should first read the official UI style guide by Microsoft, which also refers to the already mentioned document about dialog boxes.\nThe resource editor of Visual Studio does not allow to combine DS_MODALFRAME and WS_THINKFRAME for good reasons: it makes no sense to give a Window a \"modal\" look if it is NOT modal and make it resizable as well. DS_MODALFRAME does not mean \"hide system menu icon\" but \"show a window in a way, a modal dialog box looks like\".\nAnd please check existing dialog windows in applications by Microsoft - as I already mentioned the \"properties\" dialog for a file in the explorer in Windows 10 for example - and which styles they use. Maybe you will understand then.\nSo I would use DS_MODALFRAME only for dialog windows which are modal (which means you can not do anything else as long as the dialog is open) and not for every dialog just because it contains standard elements which one does not want to see.\nBut however the change will be in the end - using WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW is the worst of all and should be avoided! At the moment many dialog windows of Notepad++ really look awful in Windows 10.\n. @bahusoid I suggest to check the UI style guidelines so you understand why DS_MODALFRAME should not be combined with WS_THICKFRAME.\nAnd about the resource editor: download a copy of Visual Studio (there is a free version as well) and try it yourself - Visual Studio will not let you create a dialog box resource with both styles set together in the visual resource editor.. You are right - sorry for my harsh tone here. I just changed this. When I find some time I try to clean up things a bit. My first pull request got rejected since the WS_EX_TOOLBAR was only used to hide the standard system menu icon and removing it will bring it back of course. I created this issue here so other people may contribute as well.. @thdoan Yes - the shortcut mapper is a standard window with a system menu (which is visible when you press [Alt]+space bar).

In my opinion, it would be better to keep this functionality as a plugin and not to incorporate it as a built-in feature. For hex editing, there are excellent dedicated freeware programs. I use HxD frequently.\nThe attempt to incorporate such specific functionality in a general purpose text editor would increase the size of the executable, which would increase the time it takes to launch the editor. I personally really appreciate how quick this editor starts.\nIt would also introduce the risk that hundreds of new bugs and feature requests related to it would be added. By looking at the pull requests here at github, the developers seem to be more focused on fixing bugs related to the core functionalities. I appreciate that too.. @arnowelzel I guess the technical content is correct, because you seem to know the technical details. As a frequent notepad++ user, I would also appreciate some improvements to the UI.\nHowever, if I was one of the delevopers, I would not really feel motivated to do so after reading this kind of bug report. It should be polite.\nTo be more constructive, I suggest to use neutral wording such as \"inconsistent\" instead of rather aggressive ones like \"... really a mess ...\". Similarily, I would replace the \"... it is obvious ...\" with a modest expression like \"I guess\" or \"It seems\".\nAdditionally, I would remove speculations about why certain implementations have been done the way they are in the first sentence. Even if it was true, it doesn't help the understanding about what is wrong. It just feels bossy and leaves a negative feeling. I would suggest to turn that kind of thought to a normal question in a later part of the bug report. I believe the chances that your bug report gets positive feedback would increase this way.\n. ",

Thanks, your answer provided an insight I didn't previously consider: due to static linkage, you'd probably notice the wrong initialization order before releasing the binaries to the masses. The order would be the same for every execution so if it works on your machine it will work on everybody's machine. This makes the issue less malignant than I originally thought.

My analysis shows it won't be an issue, but please correct me if I'm wrong. The primary and secondary views are initialized upon WM_CREATE, this is safe.

LOL duplicate of #4276 that I opened a week ago.. Same cause as #4276 this is the same auto-refresh routine that also causes unresponsive freezing when opened docs are stored on a remote network location.. I have located the offending code and when I get time will try to get a build env set up to be able to just write it and submit a proper PR.  I have a couple of ideas first of all the standard FindWindow() is being used, and simply switching that single API call (in a couple spots) to FindWindowEx will then at least force a hwnd search starting at Desktop (typical) and recursing ALL CHILD windows of all apps for NPP's hwnd associated to the NPP PID.  If that itself isn't enough, it is certainly fairly trivial to add a bit of manual loop logic to nest the searching, but at first glance I question whether that is even necessary.\nIs there a known reason behind not having just used FindWindowEx in the past for a much more complete search?\nEDIT:  After some further debugging I've found at least in the case of conemu, I was correct in that the class does not change and simply the parent/child does.  Here is what it looks like once NPP is docked inside conemu:\nVirtualConsoleClass (TOP LEVEL)\n  VirtualConsoleClassBack (CHILD)\n    Notepad++ (CHILD LEVEL 2)\nBut, I have some code ideas since I was right in that since the call is already simply being made to getClassName so it simply is a matter of doing a more thorough search for existing NPP instance for mono mode, which I would think in any case is a good thing. :).

    "protector1990": "Hey I've had that issue, too. I already looked into it and I think I've found the solution. Admins, please assign this to me.. No problem :) I just hope that Don gets the time to take a look at that pull request. In the meantime, if you have a means and the will to build notepad++, you can clone my fork of notepad++ and build it from the branch I used for pull request, in order to test my fix.. I agree that sometimes it is annoying, especially if multiple files have changed. But what do you think about having a \"return to original document after modified files are reloaded\" check box in that dialog when user is asked wheather to reload the file?. Well, there are obviously multiple ways for approaching this problem, and anyway you go about it, application behavior will be changed. Now the question is what behavior is the best one, and we are not the ones to decide on it. Personally, I think that notepad++ should alert the user when a file was changed on the disk, but switching to that file by default isn't the best option.\nYour suggestions seems like a good option, too, where n++ alerts user only when they switch to the affected file.. Ok, after doing a little deeper analysis of the code, it looks to me that notifyBufferActivated() purpose should be to just notify plugins that a buffer has been activated. Also, I think that listening for NPPN_BUFFERACTIVATED notification is not the best way to figure out if a user has switched views and there should probably be a different notification for that. But again, I am not that knowledgeable about the code base, so please excuse my ignorance.\nSo, in order to keep NPPN_BUFFERACTIVATED and still solve this problem, I propose following:\n1. Extract the code notifying the plugins into a new function, say doNotifyBufferActivated\n2. Call doNotifyBufferActivated instead of notifyBufferActivated when we detect that we are switching to the same file in cloned view\nIf this makes sense to you, I can implement that change and ammend pull request.. I think that this should be discussed on the forums, and not be opened as an issue.. I think this is the expected behaviour, after all, you'd probably want to be able to easily see where you have some folded code.. ",

Changing it so that the tab for the file that was changed would be focused if you pressed \"Okay\" and not focused if you pressed \"Cancel\" seems to me like it might be a good short-term solution.\nI agree that it's annoying when you do something like, say, do a pull from Git and then you have a ton of prompts in Notepad++ that you have to click through. One solution to this might be to have the prompt appear when the tab for a file that had changed is focused, instead of just when Notepad++ is focused. What do you think?. ",

    "vor0nwe": "Hi, developer of the HTMLTag plugin here.\nI\u2019m not entirely sure how the macro system works. Apparently it doesn\u2019t simply record and then perform a click on the plugin menu item, but records (some of) the individual messages sent to the edit window, which is a Scintilla component. \nAccording to the documentation on \"Configuration Files\", the message part of the actions are Scintilla messages.\nYou can look up the scintilla messages in the Scintilla.h header file.\nLooking at your saved macro, I see the following:\n\nMessage 2013 corresponds with Scintilla\u2019s SCI_SELECTALL message. This corresponds to your step 4 \"Ctrl+A (select the whole text)\".\nMessage 2170 corresponds with Scintilla\u2019s SCI_REPLACESEL message. This would make sense, since that is the message the plugin sends after having encoded or decoded the selected text. Unfortunately, sParam only specifies a single character; in your case, a carriage return (which is the first half of a Windows line break, CR+LF).\n\nBut all the intermediate steps seem to have been omitted. In any case, even if the sParam were to contain the full text (which would be nice), you wouldn\u2019t be able to use it to repeat your action, since the macro records whatever happens in the edit window, and would then on replay replace whatever you'd selected by the encoded version of the text that was selected when you recorded the macro. It currently would not record or reproduce the fact you clicked on a specific plugin menu.. This is actually introducing an error. The correct form is \"Microsoft Windows\", or \"MS Windows\" for short. MS-Windows suggests a variant of some more generic Windows product that was specifically built by MS..

Ok, maybe do this while you can still see the entire title, but not shrinking them to the size of a pinned tab. By the way, pinned tabs would also be a good idea (as are your other points, besides the extreme shrinking one).. @shoelzer The problem I have with Chrome is not necessarily that the full tab title isn't showed when the tab is shrinked (other than when you hover over it, like you correctly mentioned), but rather that when you have a lot of tabs opened, you can't even point at small tabs easily or reasonably close them without fearing that you'll somehow affect another small tab or close something else by mistake. That's why I think that extreme tab shriking (the sort of which Chrome does) is a bad idea for Notepad++, as I explained in my first comment. I'm ok with shriking to a reasonable width though, just not to less than, say, 1 cm or so - otherwise the functionality of the application is affected, IMHO.... Well, as far as I know, there is also the option of showing tabs vertically\nin Notepad++, PLUS you have the 'Windows...' submenu in the 'Window' menu\nwhich shows the tab/window list, so when you have a lot of tabs, it's not\nthat hard to see everything in one place.

    "blackboxlogic": "Good question, I hadn't considered that it might be useful/expected. Personally, I expect ctrl+backspace to remove the previous word in any standard text entry field. I can find many examples in other software of ctrl+backspace adding a rectangle, and I consider all of them bugs that slipped through QA.\nA short list of locations and my observation of the behavior of ctrl-backspace:\n- Notepad++: Main window (remove word)\n- Notepad++: Open dialog (remove word) but I understand this dialog is borrowed from the OS\n- Notepad++: Preferences dialog (rectangle)\n- Notepad++: Find dialog (rectangle)\n- Chrome: Every field I can find in the interface (remove word)\n- MS Outlook: Every field I can find does (remove word)\n- MS Word: Every field I can find does (remove word)\n- Visual Studio: Find dialog (rectangle), everywhere else (remove word)\n- WordPad: Find dialog (rectangle), everywhere else (remove word)\n- Notepad: All dialogs (rectangle)\nMy primary questions:\n- Is there a design document specifying (rectangle) behavior?\n- Does anyone actually want/use (rectangle) behavior? (and how could we find out?)\n- Is it useful to search a document for this symbol. A symbol which is so uncommon that it cannot be easily typed into the document.\n. I understand (rectangle) is natural to the computer.\nMy opinion is that (remove word) is natural to User (and therefore, desired behavior).\nWould this suggestion be more palatable as a feature request instead of a bug report?. Being new to open-source, what's the next step on an issue like this?\n- Gather community consensus on if the change should be made\n- Wait for an authoritative voice to assert that the change should be made\n- Wait for someone to make the change\n- Try to make the change myself, and let people argue over the pull request?. Yes... also as a work around you can also extend your index finger and repeatedly press the backspace key until the offending word is gone. That's how it's been done ever since we crawled out of the primordial goop.\nThis ticket was intended as a usability improvement over that process (now that we have opposable thumbs). Oh, I was just hoping that the existence of a less-than-perfect work-around wouldn't make the suggested change any less valuable. Yes, my last comment was composed with far less care than deserved. You caught me.. Related: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1124639. After a brief attempt at fixing this issue, I've found that the UI framework, and the controls involved do not natively support the desired behavior. Writing code to handle change events would be messy and probably isn't worth it.\nDetails:\nThe control is a ComboBox, which internally has an EditControl. Neither of them support the autocompletion feature I was looking for, thinking it would enable ctrl-backspace removing a whole word.. ",

    "credomane": "\nThis is because the Find/Replace/Files/Mark dialog defines \"underlined-R\" twice, once on the Replace page, and once on the Files page. It just so happens that the processing for the Files page happens first, so that's what happens in your scenario. This would be a simple fix--just eliminate the duplication.\n\nDuplication isn't the issue. If you pressing R while the replace button on the replace tab has focus THEN notepad++ actually triggers the replace button on the hidden Find in Files tab. If anything else (excluding the text inputs, obviously) on the replace tab has focus then pressing R triggers the replace button on the replace tab as expected. \nYet if you switch to the Find in Files tab and try all the above steps then pressing R does absolutely nothing at all but all the other keys work for that tab.\nThis is definitely a coding error somewhere. The fact that Match whole word only & Match case are on both tabs, are using the same shared keys in both tabs and work perfectly fine is proof of that.. This feature doesn't change the read-only flag on the file system. It affects whether you are allowed to edit that tab inside of notepad++ itself.

I'd wager it is truly this in all POSIX compliant shells.\nTo work around it, you usually have to do something like: echo 'This is a single' \"'\" 'quote.' or just use double quotes most of the time.\nIt's frustrating when you're going between a lot of things; one solution I found was repeatedly concatenating the string with STRING+='literalstuff' and then STRING+=\"${interpretedthing}\".

The 'natural' thing to do, is to ram all the physical motions as close together in time as possible, mouse-click, mouse-click, -keypress, mouse-click.

We users of Windows call a window: \"A rectangular area on a screen in which a document, database, or application can be viewed independently of the other such areas.\"\nThink of this matter as if you used Chrome. You can use 1 window with many tabs or you can move a tab to a new Chrome window. Now you have one app working in 2 windows. Thus you can have several windows of Chrome (or Firefox) each having a random number of tabs at a certain moment.\nWhen you close Chrome, that structure of windows&tabs is memorised and when you open it again the structure is reconstructed, so you can continue your work from where you left it.\nThis is not possible in Notepad++. Tabs can be moved to a new window, but you cannot save the whole Notepad++ work session. Only the structure of one of the windows is saved. All the other Notepad++ windows are lost. This is a nightmare when the power is lost unexpectedly.\nI really have no idea what \"view\" you mean. I clearly wrote \"window\".. Indeed, sasumner, you sound quite idiotic :) Go back to the first computer lessons. Learn what a program is, a window, a tab... From where have you idiots come and made the Internet stink like that  in the past 15 years?

It should only change when the box itself is clicked.\"\nIt would not matter how long the text is, because clicking the text should not affect the box. Only clicking within the box should change it.\nMany times I have wondered why my searches failed until I noticed that the \"Backwards direction\" box was checked.  Now I realise that clicking in the middle of the unfocussed and partially transparent \"Find\" window actually changed that setting because I clicked too close to (2 or 3 cm from) the end of the text.\nThis simply should not happen.\n. @DavidHansen-0x454d43 Thanks for your agreement. I agree it is normal UI practice to affect the control by clicking the label and this is fine when the Find window has not lost focus.\n@sasumner : re. your first comment: Totally correct.\n@sasumner : re. your second comment: We agree that the white space should not affect the control but, when the Find window is highly transparent, it is often difficult to see where the text label ends and the underlying text of the file being edited lies. This is why I would prefer the Find window to not affect controls at all when it has lost focus. When it has gained focus, i.e. not transparent, then how it works now is fine - even activating the controls by clicking in the white space to the right is OK because you can see what you are doing. Having said that, logically I think it is wrong.\nI think the simplest change would be to not change the controls when the Find window does not have focus - just let that first click give the Find window focus.\n. @sasumner: interesting.  I have seen the \"click through\" feature in a program called ClocX, a very nice analog clock program for Windows desktop. It produces a small analog clock image on the desktop. \nBut when click-through is enabled, all clicks on the clock image are passed right through it to the desktop -  the clock program doesn't become active. \nThe program also has a transparency feature so the clock can remain visible in, say, the top right corner of your desktop and can cover the close button of a window beneath it. But when you move the mouse pointer over the clock, the clock becomes transparent so you can see and click on the close button of the window beneath. That close button then works and the clock program is not affected. Moving the mouse pointer away from the transparent clock image makes it visible again. . @sasumner Yes, so it looks like we should just decide how we would like the Find window to behave, rather than try to equate its behavior to some inconsistently defined feature of other programs. :) . @andreszs @sasumner \nThere's only one problem I have with the Find window, which I've discussed here. As an obsolete software engineer/manager/director, now retired, I'm quite happy with a dialog window  :)  \nSmall steps, people, small steps.\n. @sasumner I use \"Agent Ransack\" a lot to search for files containing certain text (usually in batch/command files, looking for keywords or variables) and that has an excellent search toolbar. \nI hope that is what @andreszs means. But, for now, just fixing the \"single click to only re-focus the Find window\" would be a major step forward for me.\nAnd we must never forget that this excellent program is free.\n. I think you may be onto something. The reason I started this thread was because Notepad would report the search text not found after the first occurrence, but Agent Ransack reported it present in multiple places. \nWhat happened was this: after I found the text once and worked on it, I would re-focus the Find window and search again, but \"Not found\" was the response.\nIt was only when I noticed the \"Backward direction\" box was checked that I found the problem. This happened several times before I realised that re-focussing the Find window also caused the \"Backward direction\" box to be checked because the \"blank\" area of the Find window that I usually clicked on was actually active - even though it was well past the end of the \"Backward direction\" text.\nSo come on, Notepad++ guys, at least make it an option for the first click on the unfocussed Find window to only make it focussed again, and not activate any of the boxes.\n. @sasumner Heh, heh, very good! The \"Backwards direction\" checkbox was introduced just recently, IIRC. \nIn fact, I just recalled - literally while I was typing that first line - that I used to have a similar problem with the checkbox \"Match whole word only\" being checked accidentally. \nFirst, I remembered that the \"Backwards direction\" checkbox was relatively new, so I looked at which checkbox would have been in that position in a previous version, and that's when I recalled the \"Match whole word only\" box had given me the same problem - it was being inadvertently checked and screwing up my subsequent searches when I clicked on the unfocussed Find window. I'm pretty sure that when that problem occurred I had assumed the checkbox had been set deliberately by me for a previous search and that Notepad++ had remembered that setting. \nSo this problem has been around for quite a while and it all results from activating checkboxes when clicking on the almost transparent Find window when it had lost focus. \n. @sasumner Ah, thanks for the clarification. I wondered why your animation didn't have the \"Backward direction\" checkbox and the other text was so different from the version I am running - 7.5.2.\nBut the basic concept is clear. \nI'm tempted to reinstall some very old versions of Notepad++ to see if the problem has always been present. I have them all from v5.7 (September 2010) to 7.5.3. (I'm not sure why I haven't installed 7.5.3 yet, I must check.)\nHaving just looked at the download page, I see there is also 7.5.4 available and all earlier versions are also available for download. Oh well, I will still keep a copy of everything I install on this PC as I believe it is good practice.\n. ",
    "andreszs": "By now, any decent IDE has replaced the obsolete Find dialog windows with an integrated toolbar, but Npp refuses to leave the 90's. That dialog is responsible for a lot of headaches and discussions but no one seems to take it seriously enough to redesign it.. It looks more like a system issue. Anyway, you can try to completely uninstall and manually erase the reg settings, restart, and install N++ again as a brand new setup.. A Filetype filter would be great, but since no GUI changes are made anymore, your feature will surely get discarded as well.\nAs a counter-measure, I always create sudirs for each filetype, for example, images, CSS, JS, and so on, to prevent unneeded files from cluttering the Folder as Workspace area. It depends on the target language used of course, but it works for Web.\n  . Nice idea, but you can forget about it because Npp will never alter its GUI, as the GUI updates have been deprecated.

However, the titles of those items are somewhat less clear as to the scope of the issue, namely that glyphs are being chosen inconsistently depending on the context of the code points in question.\nI also tried various fonts and discovered that this problem disappears with many font selections.  (This is easy to check, thanks to the N++ feature of \"previewing\" any change to the default font selection, rather than having to click OK to see the results.)\nAfter some additional research, I'm guessing this has to do with script-detection logic that isn't working exactly as intended.  Perhaps for reasons of efficiency, font fallback for unsupported code points does not appear to be done on a per-character basis, but rather by detecting the script for a block (i.e. line, as it appears in this case).  This would explain why adding certain characters would change the display, as they would affect the detected script for the line.\nMaybe someone with better knowledge of font fallback and script detection can provide a more definitive explanation..

above, does not solve the fact that at the next 7.6.4 update, you might see a 32 bit installer again, so look out for that, once 7.6.4 is out.\nnote: i have not been able to reproduce a 32 bit installer being downloaded by a 64 bit install, on clean machines, where no leftovers from an older 32 bit installation are hidden somewhere.\nbut all reported instances of this issue, where we got feedback over at the notepad++ community, have been able to be solved by uninstalling notepad++ completely AND deleting all older, eventually still existing notepad++ folders at the locations %ProgramFiles%\\Notepad++, %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Notepad++, %AppData%\\Notepad++, %LocalAppData%\\Notepad++, and %ProgramData%\\Notepad++, before installing notepad++ x64 again.\n(yes it's much work, but it seems to have worked for the users that reported back, and you will also have an ultra clean install afterwards)\nbtw: if you are not a notepad++ community visitor yet, you are also very welcome to participate and share any of your experiences over at the notepad++ community forum: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/ to exchange any information with a wider audience of devs and regular users, that might have or need fixes and workarounds for many different issues.\n(you don't have to sign up, just log in with your existing github or google account.). @richard4339 \nif you have the DSpellCheck plugin installed:\ncan you please try to remove this plugin (or rename your DSpellCheck.dll temporarily to DSpellCheck.dl_), restart notepad++ and retry ?\nreason: we had some reports about that, over at the notepad++ community, and removing the DSpellCheck plugin, resulted in a huge speedup when (re)opening a previous session with a lot of big files and many tabs.. @rolandh \nyes, 1-3 seconds for a tab switch between appx. 50mb files is about the usual speed on a 32 bit notepad++ 7.5.x\nif you'd like to try out something faster:\n please download the latest portable notepad++ 7.6.3 x64 from here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/7.x/7.6.3/npp.7.6.3.bin.x64.zip\n extract npp.7.6.3.bin.x64.zip to your desktop or within your download folder.\n start notepad++ by double clicking on the notepad++.exe inside this npp.7.6.3.bin.x64 folder.\n open a few of your larger documents or logs.\n scroll all opened documents down a bit and set the cursor somewhere at the middle, instead of the top of the document.\n switch between all tabs and take track of the time between tab switches.\nside notes:\nthis portable version can coexist with your current notepad++ installation and runs completely isolated from your installed version.\nany settings or changes within the portable version, including installing or removing plugins using the built in \"plugins admin\" will not alter your installed version, and vice versa.\nthis portable 7.6.3 x64 should run considerably faster than your installed notepad++, even though it contains DSpellCheck by default. you will get another (albeit smaller) speed boost if you remove DSpellCheck from there too.\ntab switching speeds will eventually decrease, if one or more of the larger documents are located on network drives or slower usb drives.. @donho \nyes, good idea.\neveryone who needs DSpellCheck can always download it using plugins admin in the future.\ni think it will be very easy to support, because a missing DSpellCheck will only be noticed after a completely fresh 7.6.4 install.\npeople who just upgrade from 7.6.3 to 7.6.4 will presumably not be affected, as they already have DSpellCheck inside their plugins folder. they can and will be supported as usual, if they experience a slowdown due to DSpellCheck.. @rolandh \n\nOnce notepad is open changing tabs is instant with zero lag.\n\nyes, and imho this is the only important thing.\ni personally do not mind a 11 second startup time to open all tabs, as long as i can switch between tabs as instantly as possible, after everything has loaded up.\nimho the current notepad++ x64 version 7.6.3. does a very good job at this, and i often have more than 5 multi-lines of tabs opened.. @Predelnik \nthank you for your participation.\n\nSo first of all - I haven't seen this issue before and I'm sorry for it but it's really not easy to find all the relevant issues unless they are linked to me directly or separate DSpellCheck issues are created.\n\nall known incidents, back at the notepad++ community, that either had this lag problem or the \"Exception reason: vector too long\" issue, were solved with satisfaction, once the o.p. uninstalled DSpellCheck.\n(at least all cases, where we got feedback from the o.p., but i guess that even the 1-2 that did not report back, would have persisted, if their personal issue would not have been solved)\nnote: most of them were not even aware that they had DSpellCheck installed, as it is a forced, bundled plugin, so making DSpellCheck optional might be the most logical choice.\nmy best guess for the lack of reports at the DSpellCheck project site would be, that many users do not open an issue at the DSpellCheck project site, if they do not require a spell checker in notepad++.\nall who do need DSpellCheck would probably have submitted an issue to your tracker already. (you would have to re-check that)\n\nhowever still not see much of a difference with or without DSpellCheck present.\n\nyes, and thank god that it does not happen to all users, otherwise we would not get any sleep at all, assisting such hypothetically vast amount of reports ;-)\nif you like, you can read more about every day incidents regarding DSpellCheck, or any other topics that might be of interest to you, over at the notepad++ community.\nwe would also appreciate, if you would take the time to answer some of them first-handedly..

(ping, ping)\nour last resort of hope would be that @donho takes the lead on that, to step in and revert autodetection to the old 7.5.9 code, even though he has not produced this near escalation himself.\nps for @donho : as soon as the auto updater is set to 7.6.4 this issue can possibly escalate, as it produces broken files, due to wrongly mixed encoding of characters when re-saving, as long as autodetect character encoding is enabled by default.\nso please help us and keep repeatedly pinging @CookiePLMonster ... and tell him he is very invited to help us answering our every day user requests over at the community, INCLUDING all incomings regarding his commit \ud83d\ude09\nworkaround for @SmashManiac :\ncurrently, until a fix is decided it is necessary to:\n* go to settings > preferences > misc and disable auto detect character encoding as seen at the screenshot below.\n\n\nthen go to settings > preferences > new document and set your preferred default encoding to e.g utf-8, as seen at the screenshot below.\n\n. i can confirm this behaviour if encoding autodetect is activated, and a file is wrongly detected as eg. windows-1258 encoding, example: any utf-8 file with the word \"Mosa\u00efque\" in it. @chcg \nthanks for the info.\ni submitted this issue here, due to a french user at the community which provided good examples that lead to further testings at the community.\nit is of course yours and dons choice if you commit a regression or wait for a fix at ucharted, so that there is no more fallback to vietnamese if there is a trigger but no certainty.\n. @chcg @donho \ni've just compiled and tested uchardet 0.0.6 as stand-alone cli and it does not produce this issue.\nall files and samples listed above are detected correctly as utf-8, for example paquet.xml\nso there is no need to open an issue about that at freedesktop.org\n\n@chcg \ndid you test the steps to reproduce listed above, or did you just assume that the original uchardet 0.0.6 code could be the source of this issue ?\nplease test the steps to reproduce listed above and also uchardet 0.0.6 as stand alone on the same files if you have the time.. @chcg \n\nSeems you used some precompiled version from ubuntu, is this correct?\n\nno, i built it manually, uchardet 0.0.6 is not in the debian apt repos yet, so you have to compile it yourself.\n\nDid you compile also compile the commandline version for windows and checked the examples there?\n\nno, only on mac and ubuntu, as i don't develop on windows and lack some tools.\nbut good idea, did you already have time to compile it on windows ?\nthe detection errors of it's implementation in npp are many, and it's fortunately easy to reproduce, so this might help you in finding where uchardet 0.0.6 behaves differently in this implementation.\n. @chcg\nbtw: thanks for looking into it and sorry for my sometimes very direct way of asking for things.\ni'm a very thorough tester, and once i have enough information and an explicit reproducibility, i tend to forget to communicate it with more patience and politeness to devs.\nnote: i behave differently, with almost exhaustless patience and politeness, towards notepad++ users and newbies with a question, even if it has been asked a (perceived) million times before.\ni sincerely apologise for not showing the same behaviour internally, but i'm working on that ... i promise ;-). completely off topic and triggered by a thumbs up:\n@sasumner we still miss you.\nif your first thought is, that 4 years+ of exhaustless, patient and productive support is enough, and it's time to move on, thinking many (but by far not all) things you've taught have already been assimilated by other readers, you're right ...\n... but nevertheless, even if you decided you don't want to read or answer any more questions, i think you can imagine what it would mean, once a year or so, to hear a comment or hello from teacher to alumni, regardless if it's sarcastic or not \ud83d\ude09. hi @donho, @SinghRajenM, @chcg, an all\ni have continued testing, because i still can't understand why the same uchardet 0.0.6 source code behaves differently on windows than on ubuntu or mac.\nin addition to the ubuntu and mac uchardet test builds i made, i've built uchardet.exe cli tool on windows (native not cygwin), using the same, identical, official source code from\nhere: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/uchardet/releases/uchardet-0.0.6.tar.xz\n(clean and newly extracted from the tarball)\nas suggested by @chcg ...\n... and the result has to be a work of evil, evil witch-craft \ud83d\ude09:\nthe same source code behaves completely different on windows, than on ubuntu and mac !!! \nthe linuxoid builds detect all files i've tested correctly, but the windows uchardet.exe cli build shows the same, multiple, erroneous mismatches, on the same test files from above, as the notepad++ implementation does !?!?!?! \ud83e\udd14\u2753\nonly one of the 4 test files is detected correctly on windows.\nbut on linuxoid builds, all 4 files are detected correctly. \nhere is the screenshot of the windows cli tests of the same files from above:\n\nand here again on ubuntu (same uchardet 0.0.6 source code, same files) for direct comparison:\n\n\nheeeeeeelp ... i'm getting bonkers over this phenomenon, as i don't understand it at all.\ni currently feel like a maggot that tries to understand the big bang theory \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude02 .\ngreetings and best regards, metachuh. @SinghRajenM \n\nVery surprising... Still not able to understand, why. \ud83e\udd14\n\nis scott the only part of this issue you have read and noticed ? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d\nthen i guess, that noone has any idea, or explanation, why the same uchardet 0.0.6 source code behaves differently on windows than on ubuntu.\nmaybe it really is evil, evil witch-craft \ud83e\udd14\ni think it will be best to regress to the old code, as no one understands this 0.0.6 phenomenon yet.. hi @Franckybleu \ni did not, but @vlakoff already has compiled the latest nightly from about yesterday, and it apparently has even worse results on windows than 0.0.6.\nsee his results here: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/5310#issuecomment-464447576\n\nThanks for your help and sorry for my english :-(\n\nnever worry, your english is better than my french, and both our language capabilities are still better than the current \"uchardet on windows\" auto-detection \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. @donho \nas the 7.6.4 release is probably near:\ncould you please disable \"autodetect character encoding\" as a default setting on notepad++ fresh installs and all portable versions, until a fix for UCharDet 0.0.6 on windows, or a regression to the old autodetect code is done ?\nreason:\nthe broken autodetect is currently the most frequent incident topic over at the notepad++ community.\n(we will cope with all requests of people that still have autodetect enabled, so it's not necessary to implement any force-disable of autodetect on update, if the user has autodetect still enabled)\nhere are some search results if you need a better overview of the amounts.\n(note: there are more, those are only the searches that have the explicit words \"character encoding\" in their topics)\nnotepad++ community search for \"character encoding\"\ngoogle notepad++ community site search for \"character encoding\", limited to the time since notepad++ 7.6 release on 2018.11.13\nthank you for your eventually possible consideration, or a short heads up if you have a reason not to, or any other doubts.\ni respect and i'm grateful for any of your decisions regarding this.. @masbaehr @PauloFrancaLacerda \ni can confirm, last safe autodetect version is 7.5.9.\napparently since the implementation of UCharDet 0.0.6 the auto detection is broken.\ni've filed an issue here: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/5202\nit's not yet accepted, but it already got confirmed and labeled as bug+regression by @chcg \nbut it was not possible to find and solve the cause yet. (therefore the regression label referring to 7.5.9)\nside note: UCharDet 0.0.6, as a stand alone command line tool, seems to run fine on linux and mac with all tested documents, but it's implementation in notepad++ on windows causes this issue somewhere far beyond my comprehension.. @BugFeedbacks \nif you open an utf-8 file, which contains german umlaute, and you can not see the bullet at encoding > encode in utf-8, you probably have 7.6 to 7.6.3 installed.\nyou might also experience files, where you try to set encoding > encode in utf-8 and the bullet will disappear immediately.\nthe implementation of the autodetect character encoding \"UCharDet 0.0.6\" since version 7.6 has caused this.\ncurrently, until a fix is found it is necessary to:\n* go to settings > preferences > misc and disable auto detect character encoding as seen at the screenshot below.\n(entferne den haken bei kodierung automatisch erkennen)\n\n\nthen go to settings > preferences > new document and set your preferred default encoding to e.g utf-8, as seen at the screenshot below.\n\n\nplease report back if this workaround fixes your issue experience.. @BugFeedbacks \ni can not reproduce your experience, if both settings of the workaround above are correctly set.\n(see screenshot of my testing result)\n\nif i create \"Evidence.txt\" with the contents:\nFriedrich Meier\nSchienenstra\u00dfe 12\n12099 Berlin\nmake sure it is set to utf-8, change the line endings to unix (lf), and save it to a ntfs ssd.\nthen i close the \"Evidence.txt\" tab.\n(optional but irrelevant: close notepad++ completely, and reopen notepad++)\nre-open \"Evidence.txt\" by either using the \"edit with notepad++\" (\"mit notepad++ \u00f6ffnen\") context menu, or the open file menu from within notepad++.\nthe file is correctly loaded as utf-8, because we have previously disabled auto detection, and set our default to utf-8 and checked apply to opened ansi files.\ncan you please re-check, to help us find out which of your settings might differ, which might cause what you see ?\nall answers might be of use for others at our notepad++ community, as this broken autodetection issue is currently one of the most discussed issues, or maybe the most discussed already.. @vlakoff \nyes, this is a known issue.\nautodetect character encoding is broken since notepad++ version 7.6.\ncurrently you have to disable settings > preferences > misc > autodetect character encoding as seen at the screenshot below.\n. @vlakoff \nyes, the culprit is bfb7e86 UCharDet 0.0.6.\nthe same compiled source code runs fine on ubuntu and mac, detecting all my test files correctly with various languages, but if the same (!) source code is compiled on windows, it behaves very erratically.\neasiest to reproduce with the compiled standalone uchardet command line checker tool.\nonce compiled on ubuntu and windows, both will have very different detection results on the same files.. @CookiePLMonster\n\nThis is very upsetting. Upgrade broke detection in some cases but it was done to fix it elsewhere - so what would mean the library introduced regressions. I'm not sure how to proceed with that, seems like a lose-lose situation...\n\nyes, i agree with you, and i suppose anything (regression, fix attempts) would be better than to leave it like it is.\nwe would gladly offer as much time as needed, to help with any fix attempt tests, using all our documents, collected from personal tests, and reports at the notepad++ community.\n\nthe strangest thing is that indeed the same uchardet 0.0.6 source code behaves differently when compiled on windows than to ubuntu.\na linux uchardet cli build detects all files we've tested correctly as utf-8, but the windows uchardet.exe cli build shows the same, multiple, erroneous mismatches as notepad++ 7.6+ does, on the same test files \ud83e\udd14\u2753\nhere is a screenshot of 4 windows uchardet cli tests:\n\nand here again on ubuntu (same uchardet 0.0.6 source code, same files) for direct comparison:\n. @CookiePLMonster and all\ndid you make up your mind on how to proceed with this issue ?\nif not you are very welcome to join everyone at the notepad++ community, and answer at least 25% of the issue reports, as soon as the auto updater url will be set from 7.5.9 to 7.6.4, deploying the current UCharDet 0.0.6. implementation to millions of users ;-). can this be closed with https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/4472620f3039d3e6fd61da8b2095b7f3c9b02551 ?. @apavic-tgm \nit is most likely, that you have a left over \"shell open command\" from an older notepad++ installation\n(one where the path argv %1 is not passed to notepad++.exe as \"%1\" within double-quotes)\nplease open regedit.exe and browse to the following keys:\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Applications\\notepad++.exe\\shell\\open\\command\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Notepad++_file\\shell\\open\\command\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\Applications\\notepad++.exe\\shell\\open\\command\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Notepad++_file\\shell\\open\\command\ncheck the entries and make sure that the argument values are within double-quotes at the default (standard) REG_SZ value of all these keys:\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\" \"%1\"\n(make sure it is not C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe %1 )\nfor the 32 bit version.\nor \"C:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\" \"%1\" if you are using the 64 bit version\n(you did not provide your mandatory debug information, so we are not aware of which release of 7.6.3 you are using). @RoyLehmann \nin order to be opened as read only using -ro, your document C:\\Users\\RoyLehmann\\VisualStudio\\MyData\\MyFinances.xml must not have been opened before in a saved session.\n(you have to close MyFinances.xml, as -ro will only work if the file will not be loaded by a session)\nif you want to use -ro, you have to disable\nsettings > preferences > backup > remember current session for next launch\nand\nsettings > preferences > backup > enable session snapshot and periodic backup,\notherwise this will override your -ro command line, as the session already contains a normally opened \"MyFinances.xml\".\na workaround, if you don't want to change those settings at your installed, every day notepad++,\nis to download a portable version from >>> here <<<,\nextract it to e.g. C:\\PortableApps\\npp.7.6.3.bin,\nstart it by double-clicking on C:\\PortableApps\\npp.7.6.3.bin\\notepad++.exe,\ndisable sessions in this portable (completely independent) notepad++,\nand then use the command line:\n\"C:\\PortableApps\\npp.7.6.3.bin\\notepad++.exe\" -ro \"C:\\Users\\RoyLehmann\\VisualStudio\\MyData\\MyFinances.xml\" instead\nhope this helps.. @SinghRajenM \nnice find and very intriguing.\ni can confirm and reproduce your discovery on all my current test setups, notepad++ 7.5.5, 7.5.9, 7.6, 7.6.2 and 7.6.3, installed as well as portable, both x86 and x64.\nit will probably be the same behaviour on all older versions, that have a status bar at the find window.\n(i don't see this character junk on e.g. version 5.9.3, because it is so old, that it didn't have the find status bar implemented yet). @Sivanime \nyou have copied the multiline content from your \"a,b,c\" example including line feeds.\n\nplease press and hold [alt] before selecting your a,b,c example lines vertically.\nthen press [ctrl]+[c] to copy the content to your clipboard.\ngo to your \"1,2,3\" example tab.\nplace your cursor after the number 1\nnote: you don't need to [alt] select at your \"paste\" target, it is only required at the \"copy\" source.\npress [ctrl]+[v] to insert your multiline text.\n\nif you've done everything correctly, the result will be this:\n1A\n2B\n3C\n4\n5\n6\n7\nadditional note: \nif you need to fill up the rest of the lines, repeat the multiline paste, by putting the cursor behind number 4, then press [ctrl]+[v] again, etc.. @zdroju \nthe \"backup on save\" has a completely different function than the \"session snapshot\".\nthe session snapshot folder, is the folder where unsaved files are stored.\nthe path is fixed to either %AppData%\\Notepad++\\backup\\ on an installed notepad++, or your_path_to\\npp.7.6.3.bin.x64\\backup on a portable version.\nthe path you have specified at \"backup on save\" on the other hand, will do exactly that: it will backup on save and only that.\nas soon as you save a file, and have backup on save enabled, notepad++ will backup the previous version of this file to your specified backup folder, so you will be able to revert to the previous version, if you encounter any bugs after editing and saving.\nthe verbose backup will keep all previous versions, as soon as you hit save, at your specified custom backup directory location.\n(or, if you do not specify a custom backup directory, the versioned backups will be at the original file's location, inside a folder called nppBackup.)\nthis will allow you to have a look at (or revert to) any previous version of this file.\n(the oldest available version will begin at the moment you enable verbose backup and will continue to backup on save, as long as you keep verbose backup enabled). @zdroju \n\nis there any chance for you to ALLOW to edit this \"session snapshot folder\" setting ???\n\nyes, you can change the snapshot folder from within the \"cloud\" option at the preferences:\n first, use windows explorer to create an empty folder at any location where you want your snapshots and periodic backups to be written to.\n(important: it's recommended to use a local drive location only, as a network drive that is offline for just less than one second can lead to session data loss)\n go to settings > preferences > cloud, select set your cloud location path here and browse to the folder you have created, as seen at the screenshot below:\n\n\nnow restart notepad++ and go to settings > preferences > backup and you will see that the session snapshot backup path has been set to a backup folder inside your custom path, which you have set as \"cloud\" path.\nfrom now on, all your snapshots and periodic session backups will reside there. (see screenshot below)\n\n\n\nnote: this custom folder (cloud folder) will also contain all your settings, custom context menus and custom shortcuts/run menu entries, so those will also be saved twice a day on your machine.\n\nhope this helps.\nplease don't forget to close this issue, if you are satisfied with the result, to help keeping the notepad++ issue list clean.\n. @Vlado-99 \nyes, you are correct.\nthe implementation of UCharDet 0.0.6 since version 7.6 has caused this.\ncurrently, until a fix is found it is necessary to:\n go to settings > preferences > misc and disable auto detect character encoding\n go to settings > preferences > new document and set your preferred default encoding to e.g windows-1250, as seen at the screenshots below.\n\n\nafaik, fixing this without regressing to the old code, is apparently going to be very difficult, because the identical UCharDet 0.0.6 code behaves completely different on windows, than it does on linux.\n(UCharDet 0.0.6 works perfectly on linux)\ni believe @CookiePLMonster and @donho have already analysed this, but i, as a user, don't know the status quo of what can be done next.. @JL2210 \n\nYou forgot a leading period.\n\na leading period would be:\n\".The best things in life are free\na closing period would be:\nSo Notepad++ is the best.\"\na periodic inconsistency would be:\nTh.e b.es.t thin.gs in li.fe are f.ree \ud83d\ude09\nwould you like to close this issue, or do you really take this missing dot as a serious matter ?. @melban \ni can confirm this issue, but only if you are using the old open/save dialog style.\nplease go to settings > preferences > default directory and make sure that use new style dialog is activated, as seen at the screenshot below.\n\nplease retry, after you have activated the new style dialog.\nattempting to open c:\\\\ as a file, will now give you an expected, invalid file name alert, instead of looping/freezing.. @sasumner \nyes, you are absolutely correct, and i had more or less exactly the same sentence written down already.\n(my deleted end quote: \"but you're right, it should work on the old style dialog too.\")\nbut i hesitated and removed that, as i don't know yet, if any fixing change at the old style dialogue code might get in conflict with it's functionality on wine platforms.. @timikesmarky \nif you are not a notepad++ community visitor

and the Markdown (Default) issue is solely based on an udl name of 15 characters or more.\nthe () brackets are not the cause, sorry about my premature assumption.. and i'm glad you write the way you do, so it was very easy to find, very easy to read and relate to the issue i've encountered while testing the deployment issues of the now distributed Markdown (Default) udl.\nyes, hopefully someone gives these a look.\nwe might accept bets over at the notepad++ community whether ...\n udl name input field will be limited to 14 chars.\n udl name lenght limit will be corrected to use the full 21 chars everywhere.\n* the included Markdown (Default) udl will be renamed to Markdown to make it shorter, the rest stays the same. \ud83d\ude09\ngreetings, metachuh\n. @vrubleg \nyou could have a look at YourPathTo\\Notepad++ and YourPathTo\\Notepad++\\userDefineLangs if it is still there (open all userDefineLang.xml or anyname.xml files you find in notepad++ or another editor, and check if it contains <UserLang name=...).\nin your case, i don't think it is in %AppData%\\Notepad++ or %AppData%\\Notepad++\\ userDefineLangs, but check there as well.\nalso check for any plugins\\APIs leftovers from older versions.\ndo you remember if you have copied userDefinedLang-markdown.default.modern.xml, or an userDefineLang.xml that contained markdown, manually, before you updated to 7.6.3 or 7.6.4 ? \nplease also give us your debug info, i will try to reproduce your udl disappearance and double markdown experience, by installing 7.6.3 at your custom location with don't use %AppData%, creating an udl, and then updating to 7.6.4 after we got your info.\n. > FYI, it is possible that the issue is a bit older than I think.\nthat concurs with my testing. \ni have tested your configuration extensively, to try to reproduce a double markdown udl, as well as to see if any userDefineLang.xml get's overwritten under any circumstances.\ni have tested all with a blank windows 7 pro x64 vm, using various combinations of updating from 7.6.3 to 7.6.4, as well as from 7.6.2 to 7.6.3 to 7.6.4.\ndouble Markdown (Default) entry:\nthis only happens, if you e.g. originally started off with a completely fresh 7.6.3 install, or a userDefineLang.xml with your custom udls was not present any more at C:\\Apps\\Develop\\Notepad++\\ before running the 7.6.3 installer.\nversion 7.6.3 had the Markdown (Default) udl in the file userDefineLang.xml.\nthe 7.6.3 installer has copied userDefineLang.xml to your C:\\Apps\\Develop\\Notepad++\\ folder, as it did not exist yet.\ni then created a test udl, exited notepad++, and installed notepad++ 7.6.4 on top of it.\nthe test udl was still there, but under this scenario i confirm to get a double entry of Markdown (Default).\none in the file C:\\Apps\\Develop\\Notepad++\\userDefineLang.xml, as it was there from the 7.6.3 install, and one in the file C:\\Apps\\Develop\\Notepad++\\userDefineLangs\\userDefinedLang-markdown.default.modern.xml, which is the new, multi udl file location, since 7.6.4.\nsolution: move C:\\Apps\\Develop\\Notepad++\\userDefineLang.xml somewhere else, e.g. your desktop, as it does not contain your own udl's, but just the Markdown (Default) of a fresh, or semi fresh 7.6.3 install. then restart notepad++.\nyou can delete it, as soon as you are sure, that you don't need it again.\nmissing custom udls after updating to 7.6.4:\ni was not able to reproduce any udl file deletion or automatic replacing of an existing C:\\Apps\\Develop\\Notepad++\\userDefineLang.xml under any testing circumstances. \nregardless if starting with 7.6.3 and upgrading it to 7.6.4, as well as starting from 7.6.2, upgrading to 7.6.3, and then to 7.6.4.\nhopefully possible solution:\nthe only thing i can recommend right now, is to search on all your drives for any old userDefineLang.xml files.\nhopefully you have just moved your udl file manually somewhere, when you started off upgrading your older 7.5.x. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nmy testing debug infos:\nNotepad++ v7.6.2   (32-bit)\nBuild

crude workarounds for that at the community, so if you find any quicker workaround, until it is eventually looked at, i'd appreciate it a lot.\nif it is wanted to preserve the current word selection:\nswitch to any tab and then back to the langs.model.xml tab.\npress ctrl+f3 and then ctrl+shift+f3 to trigger select and find next and select and find previous to go back.\n(the document will then jump back to the place where it was before switching the tabs, the previously selected word or section will still be marked)\nif it is only wanted to jump back to the cursor position:\nswitch to any tab and then back to the langs.model.xml tab.\nhit [cursor right] and then [cursor left]\n(the document will jump back to the cursor where it was before switching the tabs)\nbest regards\nmetachuh. @KommX \nthe updater is currently set to 7.5.9. as a max for various technical and supporting reasons, like the plugins structure mentioned by @sasumner and other concerns.\nan update will be triggered as soon as it seems fit for the lead developer and eventual technical and supportive concerns have been minimised or cleared.\nthis approach has worked very well in the past and will serve us well in the future.\nif you like to now more in advance:\nusually all users at the notepad++ community will get a selection of relevant information from the developers prior to a release, to ensure that as many users as possible are able to help other users on as many questions as possible.\nthis shared information and the communtity forum also serves as attempt to prevent issues like this to be submitted here, in order not to fill up the project's issue tracker.\nnote:\nif you want to check which updates are available for a specific notepad++ version, without the need of having this specific notepad++ version installed and/or fired up, please open your browser and enter the following, configurable example updater url:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/update/getDownloadUrl.php?version=7.58&param=x64\nusage:\n the version get query has to be written with a single period, so you have to write it as 7.64 for notepad++ version 7.6.4\n the param query, which carries the architecture information can currently be x86 or x64\nif you like you can read and learn more about the \"guts\" of notepad++ at the\n>>> notepad++ community forum <<<.\nvisiting the community and reading as much as you can, might also be useful, because as you seem very passionate about newer notepad++ releases, you can share your passion, by helping to assist and provide answers to notepad++ users that are in need, once you have learned more about the inner life of newer notepad++ releases, and memorised some of the available solutions and workarounds for specific needs.\n(don't worry about the amount: yes, there are a few million notepad++ users all around the world, but only a few of them need help, compared to that scale)\ni hope this information will serve you well, and you have been provided with enough understandable information to close this issue yourself.. why ?. @KOLANICH \nplease bookmark this link: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/\nthis link will always redirect you to the most current version's download page directly.\n(this way you do not have to navigate the website manually again). @Faq \n@Ices-Eyes is at the correct place. \ud83d\ude02\nthis is directly related to his own commit from 2018.12 and is related to the automatic grouping of computing languages from a-z, which is part of the main code.\nexplanation:\nif a user has make language menu compact selected, and a computing language has a translation that starts with a different letter than the english name, it will still be categorised at the letter of the english original spelling.\n@Ices-Eyes \ncurrently the only workaround, without any needed code change, is to translate it to Normale (Testo).\n(ps: this workaround at your italian.xml, would apply, if you want or have to get it fixed quicker, as you could do that autonomously). @sasumner \ni guess the success was only for the windows notepad.exe.\n@monoblaine \ni do not use or read msysgit, but is it possible to set git config --global core.editor to use double quotes instead of single quotes for argv[1] ?\ndid you try to use the following config: git config --global core.editor \\\n\"'C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe'\" with single quotes in double quotes and omitting any switches ?\n(maybe this triggers msysgit to use double quotes for it's core.editor argv)\nas i have read on the quick, some users also call a batch script instead of notepad++, where they can wrap the argv within double quotes, before passing it to notepad++.\n(quick and dirty, but i guess people did it that way, because of so many contradicting solutions regarding notepad++ integration, where one user says it works perfectly, and the other one says it does not work at all).\nps: the stackoverflow page about that, which looks most promising at first glance, is: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10564/how-can-i-set-up-an-editor-to-work-with-git-on-windows\n. @sasumner \n\nI thought the OP was somehow making N++ do it. :)\n\nyes, and that is still the o.p.'s goal, if i didn't misunderstand something vital.\nthe windows notepad.exe is just a crosscheck, if single quotes would work with any other program.\n\nWhy does everybody think that notepad.exe is the base spec for notepad++.exe ?\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nnot so much everybody, and most definitively not in this case.\nbut i agree, that it would be less funny, if we wouldn't hear such associations from \"first time\" notepad++ users every once in a while. \ud83d\ude09\n. hi @monoblaine \ngood luck with your hdd, i can relate and feel with you

Later, when you need to dig deeper you could just press Ctrl+Q and further analyze new portion of code. That is idea!. By the way, you can see desired functionality in Visual Studio.

If you\nstart with a file that is mostly LF line endings and then you add some\nlines with CRLF line endings with Visual Studio....and then finally you\nopen the file in Notepad++, it seems like it is guessing that your file has\nLF line-endings, so when you paste something in it converts the line\nendings on what is pasted to LF.

    "ZtrevorZ": "Hi thanks, how would I use this to select e.g. only the 1st column of the file? It selects the full rows in between. Menu > edit > column mode tells me to use alt + mouse selection instead.. Thanks again, this makes sense.  It now almost succeeds, the grey selection stops about 10 lines before the very end but then npp freezes up. I just wonder if a column-delete functionality (without undo, and which forces a save) might avoid RAM usage and therefore succeed relatively quickly.  My file is very tall (9.5m lines, 58 chars wide) but it is an actual example. In the meantime I will have to run a script to read & write the whole file, if I want to delete a column. But npp does everything else I want. Much appreciated . ",

Alright, so I just retried it and I didn't have a problem either. Which is inexplicable to me. I was thinking maybe I made a mistake shuffling it around for testing, so I went and pulled a copy from yesterday's backup. That copy had no differences from the one I have marked as the broken one. So I went another day back, and that was also identical save for the very final newline beingCR LFin the backup and justLF``` in the copy I made when it was broken. So I tried the backup copy and it is working fine now too.\nUnless I imagined the whole thing, it seems there was some other factor at play here. I did all my testing with a single instance running at a time. I do use multiple instances frequently, which was my hypothesis for how it could have been corrupted, but I don't think multi-instance alone explains what I was experiencing.\nAnyways, since I can't reproduce the problem anymore and don't really have a good idea what caused it, unless someone else wants me to try something I guess this can be closed.. But it isn't corrupted, which is the weird part. The corruption happened at some point between when I initially copied the broken config and uploading it here. Unless there was an invisible Notepad++ process hanging around during testing, I'm quite sure I was only using a single instance.. ",

It currently even will crash if that file doesn't fit into memory. Especially it will take a long time if the lexers are turned on, may be you can save some time by switching to the \"Normal Text\" mode.\nSometimes the lexer produces in a crash in case of large file, in my case this is true for XML fiormatted files.\nTherefor I would strongly suggest you to use \"vim\" or \"gVim\" in case you need to edit such large\nfiles or use some sort of viewer that is able to handle large files like \"glogg\".\nLook here on SO for more details:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/159521/text-editor-to-open-big-giant-huge-large-text-files.

I'll send some more extensions (tools + plugins) ideas.. @DavidHansen-0x454d43 MD5 is just for instance. @DavidHansen-0x454d43 what about removing a tab with icons and replacing to tool bar? Also re-optimising toolbar and replacing commands?. @Charon77 the main idea is not color scheme, but there is no need to add Electron framework. Look at Adobe Phototshop - it is colored in non standard scheme - why not to do it in NPP? Also unusable UI is the main problem. \n",

If that's the case the option should be disabled in Two Button Mode -- makes it clear the behaviour is inconsistent.\n\n\nOOTB there are no accelerators for at least the following: \n   << \n   >>\n   Find all in current document (there's an issue for this already)\n   Backward direction. @sasumner just trying to make a great product better.. Sorry to spam. I just noticed @sasumner said \"What's not attractive about [the checkbox next to the Find << >> button(s)]\".\n\n\nUse the keyboard. Tab (because no accelerators when in 2 button mode) to the unlabelled checkbox. The focus ring around blank text -- that's not attractive. It just doesn't make sense from a UI/UX perspective. Why is a seldom used setting given such prominence?\n(and the << and >> text isn't centred in the buttons. Arrghhh!). > maybe we don't sweat the tiny stuff.\nAgain I politely disagree. Usability/user experience is the entire point of a tool like Notepad++. The more users don't notice it, the better it it is.\n? vs Help. Is it \"?\" better than \"Help\"? Is breaking convention better? What's the upside?\n\"Backward direction\" vs \"Search up\". Which is better? Which makes me think?\n\"[ ]\" vs \"[ ] two buttons\" which is better?

I found the reason why it was not working for me:\nWhen setting the proxy for the updater Notepad++ (or GUP) wants to create the file gupOptions.xml in the installation directory under the folder \"updater\". For me this is \"C:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\updater\". Since one needs administrator rights to create files there i needed to start Notepad++ as admin when setting the proxy.\nOnce the file is created the check for an update works also as normal user.\nIt would be great if Notepad++ could ask for admin rights before trying to create or change files in such protected directories (or at least open a message box that i have to start Notepad++ as admin when i want to set a proxy). I guess another solution would be to move such files to a folder where no admin rights are needed like the ProgramData or ApplicationData folder.. ",

It would be great if you would provide some feedback and/or ideas for enhancements.\nSince the plugin is not available via PluginManager (and will not in the near future), it has to be installed manually. Installation instructions can be found on the project page.\nNote: If you work with large files (10000 or more lines, depends on your hardware) the plugin will cause a serious performance decrease when loading the file and inserting or deleting lines because custom line numbers in Scintilla can only be done by self-filled text margins.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotepad-plus-plus%2Fnotepad-plus-plus%2Fissues%2F4613%23issuecomment-426213660&data=02%7C01%7C%7C4635119559244b6a881d08d6284bd1bd%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636740703427141598&sdata=eVgi8p12N2n5KwJhxWWBCvPa6q2OBRNEuhbuVdbwl6Q%3D&reserved=0, or mute the threadhttps://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotifications%2Funsubscribe-auth%2FAHnYsw7KMkEKhqVL3Z5qv-yGbpBXfippks5ugzXEgaJpZM4U7twh&data=02%7C01%7C%7C4635119559244b6a881d08d6284bd1bd%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636740703427297854&sdata=h75G%2BRdoFe%2BrJT6RBXgZTAGB4a3Z754lakQHiFKY%2BEE%3D&reserved=0.\n[https://ipmcdn.avast.com/images/icons/icon-envelope-tick-green-avg-v1.png]http://www.avg.com/email-signature?utm_medium=email&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=sig-email&utm_content=webmail     Virus-free. www.avg.comhttp://www.avg.com/email-signature?utm_medium=email&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=sig-email&utm_content=webmail\n.

Then I discovered that the source and target files were not aligned, and did that instead, only to realise there were no untranslated strings...\nAt this point I should have saved a copy, but instead went on to do a revision of the translation as it stands, and we ended up in the present situation. \nI can see from the file history you've done a lot of work on this and let me state I was impressed with the translation when I worked through the file, and if you relied on connecting source segments with target segments using only the numerical identifier, that's pretty amazing. I know what it's like when you spend time on something and then someone shows up to \"improve it\". Annoying for sure. But there were no major issues. Here's an non-exhaustive list of the changes. Let me know what you think.\nBoth the concept \"stora/sm\u00e5 bokst\u00e4ver\" and \"versaler/gemener\" were used. I changed to only \"versaler/gemener\" and simplified somewhere to use \"skiftl\u00e4ge\"\n\"Radera\" / \"Ta bort\" were both used -> \"Ta bort\" rakt igenom\nShortened some phrases, such as \"den aktuella filen\" -> \"aktuell fil\"\nMellanslag framf\u00f6r :  (removed) \nIt looks like they were added at one point, I'm guessing because they are present in the source. But as you can see from (#4628), I posit they shouldn't be there, and then again it doesn't make sense to have a space before : in some strings and not in others.\n\"teckensnitt\" / \"typsnitt\" -> enbart \"teckensnitt\"\nF\u00f6rlorad fokus -> f\u00f6rlorat fokus\nCancel in source has \"St\u00e4ng\" in target instead of \"Avbryt\", maybe there's a good reason for this, but I think I changed \"St\u00e4ng\" to \"Avbryt\" somewhere.\n\"...dess...\" -> \"...sina...\" \n\"Skapa &bokm\u00e4rke\" -> \"Skapa/ta bort &bokm\u00e4rke\"  (since it says 'toggle' in source)\n\"urklipp\" -> \"Urklipp\"\n\"Dokumentsvy\" -> \"Dokumentvy\"\n\"...omr\u00e5de...\" -> \"...intervall...\"\n\"Upprepa\" -> \"G\u00f6r om\"\n\"Angr\u00e4nsare [2-8]\" -> \"Avgr\u00e4nsare [2-8]\n\"...din Papperskorg...\" -> \"...Papperskorgen...\"\nsiffra -> siffror (id 25028)\nMatchade par [1-3] -> Matchat par [1-3]\n. I'm looking at the 'Scintillas' element right now and comparing swedish.xml and english .xml. The 'Item' elements are not in numerical order based on the 'id' attribute, that's true. But they are in the same order in both files. (6216, 6217, 6219, 6221, 6222, 6224, 6225, 6201, 6202, 6203, 6204, 6205, 6226 ...)\nI was thinking maybe english.xml had been updated since my PR, but it says \"4 months ago\" when looking at in in GitHub, so I'm not sure what you mean.\n. Assuming that OP has check for collisions of access keys within menus, this PR looks completely fine and I approve merging it. Is there an \"approve\" button I should push?\n+approve\n. What is it you don't like about them? :-)   (just curious). This went too fast for me. But maybe I'll open a PR and we can discuss my suggestions there. Thanks for the access keys anyway\n. While you're at it, take a look at the S\u00f6k-dialog and consider whether \"S\u00f6k allt\" shouldn't be \"S\u00f6k alla\" :-)\nI was just about to submit a PR and noticed you were already working in this file, so if you like, you can fix this.. \"Ers\u00e4tt allt\" --> \"Ers\u00e4tt alla\"  (see other comment).

    "OldGrantonian": "That worked great - in both directions.\nJust for feedback (not a complaint), the extra line is added at the end of each paragraph - which is fine by me. If I understood the code, I could probably have worked that out for myself.\nThanks for your help.. In the View tab, I unchecked \"Word wrap\". That caused more space between paragraphs. That's fine.\nThanks for your help.. Interesting point :-)\nI've never thought about it until now. I simply use the \"monkey see - monkey do\" approach, and copy other people.\nMaybe it's because \"words\" are real, but \"lines\" are virtual. Lines exist only in the editor - not in RAM. And each user's editor will show the same number of words, but maybe different numbers of lines.\nI think in the old days of C, a text file was simply a very long text string, with a NULL terminator. I think it was the duty of the application programmer to respect the NULL - not the OS. There was no concept of \"lines\" in memory. Paragraphs might be terminated by either LF or CR+LF, but as far as RAM was concerned, these were simply dumb bytes. Even the NULL was a dumb byte, which had to be very carefully managed by the application developer. If she accidentally deleted the NULL by using DELETE or BACKSPACE in a text box without checking if the character was a NULL, her editor might crash because I think it was trying to load all the dynamic text strings which started at the next byte after the deleted NULL, and continued till the end of the current heap :-)\nI remember seeing stuff added to the editor, such as \"Press any key to continue\" followed by maybe \"Insert the second floppy\", and so on, with dozens of non-printing characters, all joined on at the end of the editor. (Which of course proves that the editor ignores NULLs unless specifically told otherwise by the programmer. Strings were handled by pointer arithmetic, so the programmer had to keep track of the pointer :LOL)\nAssume the user deletes one character. If there is now sufficient space to move the first word of the next line to become the last word of the current line, only that word is \"wrapped\" - not the complete line. None of that is visible to someone who is simultaneously watching RAM in real time using one of the old utilities. The user simply sees that all the text after the deleted character is moved one position to the left (to the next lower RAM address). \nSo, in the previous paragraph, we can see that one word was wrapped. We can't say that one line was wrapped. So maybe that's why the term \"word wrap\" is used.\nUsing that thinking, we could say that the only way to \"wrap\" a complete line downwards is to insert a carriage return. To wrap a complete line upwards would require the removal of a carriage return.\nBTW:  you can probably believe about 60-70% of the above description. The remainder is either junk or bad memory. . Just occurred to me that some of the stuff about the use of the BACKSPACE key in a text box might not be accurate.\nI don't think the BACKSPACE key can ever delete the NULL. If the user deletes text by placing the cursor at the end of the text. The cursor (in a DOS editor) is actually OVER the NULL. So, the NULL can never be deleted.\nRegarding the DELETE key, if the user deletes only one character, the NULL is not deleted - so the bug might not be discovered till later. But if the key is held down, the bug will eventually be discovered.. ",

Instead, I opened it in Windows Notepad and copied the contents which I then pasted into Notepad++.\nAlso, yes, it did come from text copied out of message box (the .NET MessageBox.Show method in my own application)\nI have attached my screenshot to show you how it looks for me.\nWindows Notepad does not display the extra carriage returns.\n. Do you mean that Windows Notepad is eating a carriage return when displaying the text file because of the \"CR\" before it, but it still allows copying it?. Please note that I did not create the content with the mixed line endings.  My call to Microsoft's .NET message box only has normal line endings (CR LF).  Either Windows copies it incorrectly or Microsoft is generating it incorrectly.\nBut to me it seems that part of the problem is that Scintilla is converting the bad line endings instead of dropping them (the additional CR).\nI believe that there should be a way to keep these two visually the same.  (This is the file open in notepad & I copy this text).  I think that for the normal user, copying this (see image) to get the result above in Notepad++ appears to be a failure in the copy/paste operation.\n\nFYI, when I open the file in Microsoft Word, it displays the same as it does in Windows Notepad.\nCan't there be a setting somehow to control this?  Perhaps in a \"Paste Special\" action.\nI would think that the default Paste action should be to drop standalone \"CR\" entries when \"EOL Conversion\" is set to \"Windows\" and to allow \"Paste Special\" to include them and/or convert them.\nI would think many users would consider the current behaviour where they don't get what they see as wrong.\nBy the way, I appreciate all of your feedback.\nThank you so much for the understanding and helpful information.. I understand that.\nIt just seems to me that when I am running Notepad++ on Windows in Windows Line End (CR/LF) mode that its normal behaviour should be to only pay attention to normal Windows line breaks (CR/LF).\nThis could be something controlled by a preference.  It seems like that would be the desired way to deal with this since it seems like some people have concerns with this.. Is there any thoughts as to making this controllable in the future via an option/setting to allow each user to make their own decision about this behaviour?. I am not sure how I could because once it is pasted into Notepad++, it has already been converted.. Notepad++ scripts can interact with the clipboard?  I had no idea.  It seems like it would probably not be a simple task, but since I am unfamiliar with the scripting language Notepad++ uses, it would probably require extra time to ramp up... :slightly_smiling_face:  I do develop applications in VB and C#, so I am not unfamiliar with programming. :smiley:\nThankfully this hasn't really been an issue for me since I first logged it, one that re-occurred that is.\nIt just seems to me that scintilla is making some decisions for me that it should not. :frowning:\nInstead it should provide the user with the ability to change that behaviour to something that is more desirable based on the situation they are currently in.\nI thought that perhaps since this is still marked as \"Open\", then it might be available for future consideration for improvement, however, I have seen no evidence of that either.  If not then I would have expected someone to close it as \"Won't Fix\". :open_mouth:\nAt least I know now why it occurred.  Also, I want to thank you for responding to an older thread.

I then using Ctrl+mouse wheel to enlarge the font, and the problem went away. Everything was normal. When I used Ctrl + mouse wheel again to make the font smaller, the problem came back.\nConclusion: NPP has a bug with font sizing. Perhaps it is retaining font metrics from a prior screen resolution, and when the screen font is resized, it is failing to recalculate, and is positioning things as if the font were its \"former\" size rather than its \"current\" size.. Simon, here is another possibility you might want to try. It seems to have an affect for me.\nIn the Windows Mouse Settings, there is an Additional Mouse Options. Click on that. Go to Pointer Options. Near the bottom, it has a checkbox for Hide Pointer While Typing. Try disabling this checkbox and then test NPP to see if it still has the problem.\n. ",

Yes, I had previously tried adding the atomic group structure around the lookahead portion as you suggest, i.e. adding the atomic grouping \"(?>\" in the construct: \"(?>(?!\\</record>).)*?\".  This definitely helps in many, perhaps even most circumstances. \nBut even then, I am still finding cases where notepad++ ends up selecting the entire file.  \nFor example, if the element \"record\" is nested inside other elements in the XML file and there are no matches at all for \"text-string-to-find\" in the file (and the file is long, in my case 500,000+ lines), notepad++ still sometimes ends up selecting the entire file and claiming there is 1 match (when in fact there are none).\nSo it seems that there may still be cases where notepad++ may be hitting an internal issue/limit/constraint somewhere causing it to end up selecting the entire file when it doesn't find a match. Perhaps file length has something to do with it, perhaps number of lines between search matches, perhaps if it finds no matches when it reaches the end of the file causing it to select the entire file in certain situations, etc.  \nThe other seemingly related issue #683 may indicate some such scenarios where this potential issue may be occurring.\nThanks again for your helpful comment and help.\n.

",
    "Rekrullurker": "Then what's the point of being able to include a search in a macro if it doesn't matter whether the search succeeds or not? If you can't reliably use the search function in a macro to only change the parts of a file that match the search terms, then there's no point to even being able to include it in a macro. More than that, it's dangerous in that novice users may unwitting corrupt their files by running such a macro on the entire file without realizing that it will continue blindly making changes after the last occurrence of the search term is found.\nCan you please provide an example of a situation where you would want to use search (not search & replace) in a macro, but NOT have the rest of the macro be conditional on the search succeeding? Conversely, can you provide an example of how having a macro terminate when a search (not search & replace) fails to find the specified terms would break something?\nI'm not asking for the macro function to be made into a scripting language of its own with user-defined conditional execution and the like, I simply think it should at least be an option to have the macro terminate if the search fails. If the user searched for something, it stands to reason that they want the macro to find what they specified before taking whatever other actions they added. If the search fails, then the rest of the actions recorded in the macro aren't needed.\nNone of the scripting languages you mentioned are anywhere as easy to learn or use as simply having the program to record your keystrokes. Complex macros can easily be recorded by complete novices, but it falls apart if those macros only work under certain conditions. Telling people that they should learn a scripting language from scratch because you don't think a macro function should have any intelligence to it, smacks of elitism.\n. To clear up any possible confusion, I am NOT suggesting that the behavior of macros in regard to Search AND Replace be changed in any way. \"Search\" (technically \"Find\") is a completely separate menu item from \"Replace\", which initiates a Search AND Replace. I'm not trying to break everyone's existing macros. In the message below I am speaking exclusively about the stand-alone Find function which is invoked by CTRL-F. At no point should any of my comments be construed to apply to the Replace function which is invoked by pressing CTRL-H. As they are separate commands, a macro can easily differentiate between the two.\nWhen you use Find, it will reposition the cursor if the search text is found. In fact, that is the sole purpose of the Find command. There is no other reason to use it. If it is not found, the cursor doesn't move. In normal editing, Find is used to find parts of a document that you want to make changes to. If you search for something and it's not found, do you just go ahead and make the planned changes at the current cursor position regardless? Of course not. So why would you ever want a macro to behave this way?\nSince the Find command does nothing else by itself other than reposition the cursor if the search text is found, there is no conceivable reason anyone would ever use it in a macro. In other words, the sole purpose of the Find command is to conditionally reposition the cursor to a specific point in a file for the sole purpose of making changes to that specific part of the file.\nCan you give me an honest, actual example of a situation where you would use Find in a macro, but want the macro to execute regardless of whether the cursor was repositioned to another part of the file OR whether it simply stayed at its current position? Both of these conditions would produce wildly different results and there would be no reason for a user to ever create a macro that doesn't work reliably in every situation. Conversely, can you give me an honest, actual example of how it would break something if the macro terminates early when a Find command fails?\nAgain, this isn't Replace I'm talking about, but the separate Find command which only repositions the cursor. If a user wants changes made at the current cursor position, they simply record them there. If they use the Find command, it means they want the cursor repositioned to a specific part of the file.\nFrankly, I never thought this would be a controversial idea. As it stands now, almost nobody would ever use Find in a macro unless they're 100% sure that at least the last line of the file contains the search text, otherwise it's going to blindly continue making changes to the file after the last instance of the search text is found. That severely limits the use of the Find command in Macros. Consequently, if nobody is using the Find command in macros, the change I suggested (stop execution of the macro if Find fails) would not affect anyone's existing macros. Even more so if it's a user-selectable option in prefs. \nIt shouldn't even break the scripts of people who have used Find in a macro. Because the only time it can be reliably used is if they know for a fact that the last line of the file contains their search text, the macro would still work just fine because the termination condition would never happen. It would reach the end of the file and stop, just as its supposed to. \nIn other words you couldn't use my example macro on this;\nThis is a XtestX more stuff\nThis is a XtestX more stuff\nThis is a test more stuff\nThis is a test more stuff\nBecause it will mangle the last two lines. You could only use it if the file looked like this;\nThis is a XtestX more stuff\nThis is a test more stuff\nThis is a test more stuff\nThis is a XtestX more stuff\nIt would skip over the middle lines, change the last line and exit normally. If you made macro execution conditional on the search text being found, the macro would still perform as expected because it would reach the end of the file without ever encountering the termination condition. However, it would also work just fine on my first example because it would change the first two lines, see that there are no more instances of the matching text and exit. Nothing gets broken because the very limited circumstance where search is used in a macro would already be situations where the user has made sure that the macro execution will only happen at specific points of the file. Making it conditional just takes that burden away from the user.\nMy comments about elitism were in regard to the fact that you would prefer users to learn a scripting language rather than being able to make full use of the much simpler macro recording facility already built into the program. While it's true you can't know what is or isn't easy for a person to learn, you can't deny that learning a scripting language is more complex than just recording a macro. Macros are intuitive enough that even novice users can understand the process. On the other hand, learning a scripting language can be a longer, more involved process. You can argue that the rewards are much greater, but most people don't want to learn a whole language just to be able to create macros, especially when the program already has its own macro recorder. Trust me, there are people for whom unpacking a Rar file requires itemized instructions and a video tutorial, every time they do it. Such people have no hope of learning scripting. \nTo be honest, I don't know any of those languages and don't really feel inclined to learn. I've written some Windows batch files and generally found it to be a colossal pain in the a to include any kind of logic in them due to Microsoft's a-backward variable handling where you have to jump through hoops to ensure that variables actually behave the way logic tells you that they should. Not to mention trying to keep straight all the various ways variables have to be referenced depending on what type of variable it is or what you're doing with it. I usually end up spending a minimum of half an hour trying to figure out what obscure condition is preventing my perfectly logical script from working properly. Sometime I have to ask in a forum so that someone can explain why you need to do something completely different because you used a different command. I've still never been able to get the errorlevel variable to work reliably inside a loop to determine if a command executed successfully or not. For that matter, I've never understood why you have to test the errorlevel command in reverse order from highest possible value to lowest, rather than it having an absolute value that you can test for. This kind of crap drives me nuts.\nAgain, I'm not trying to break anyone's existing scripts. The only conceivable situations where you would ever use Find in macro are situations where you have already manually made sure it's not going to blindly make changes to the file. Making the macro execution conditional just automates that process.\n. ",
    "deadeyelo": "To ClaudiaFrank - My $0.02 - You might want to rethink your argument on this.  Of the several editors that support macros that I have worked with, Windows, OpenVMS, they abort macro execution on some errors failed search, down arrow, up arrow when at end or beginning of buffer, execution for more iterations than exist in file (the Run Multiple Times, executing 10 times when only 5 times is possible),  etc.  The TECO editor has searches that allow 'if success then else fail' as an option to searches (one can issue a search that doesn't check for failure, and when done in an iteration corrupts really good).\nI don't do much with UNIX/LINUX so I don't know for sure editors there abort on an error in a macro, but would guess that they do.   I also am not proficient enough with UNIX/LINUX editors to easily test them for this.  May give it a try.\nI am not sure but I think the 32 bit version of NotePad++ aborted on search fail or cursor movement that couldn't be done (line, word, character movement, not sure about begin of line, end of line if already there) did abort.  I changed to 64 bit earlier last year and felt 'surprised' when I first noticed that execution continued after and 'error' occurred.  I am thinking of going back to 32 bit as 64 bit lost several Plug-Ins I used and MACRO's don't execute reliably (don't remember having that problem until it showed up one day).  If I do that I will post an update.. ",

These are typically things I don't really want to physically save into a new file but am not yet ready to delete for whatever reason.  I can have quite a number of these open at once.  While poking around in Settings->Preferences, I found the setting on Backup that is \"Enable snapshot and periodic backup\" which also includes a backup period setting in seconds.  Since I have never had periodic backups on, this is clearly a change made in the behavior.  By using this feature, it may get me back to being able to save unsaved new files between sessions but I would have to be much more careful on existing files to make sure that any changes I make I REALLY want to keep, unless there is an option to discard any changes made when you actively go to save the file with Ctrl-S.   I will experiment with this feature (and I see that while writing this, sasumner has also suggested this setting) but I'd either like the behavior changed back or have the default behavior changed so that new, unsaved files are still saved automatically between sessions and independent of this \"Session snapshot...\" feature..

For now I'm just using 7.5.8\nThe bug is in the commit that simplified command line parsing (74d39b1).. Default Windows 10.. I was able to fix it by adding quotes around all the %1 using regedit. I had previously changed all the notepad.exe references to notepad++.exe. Some of them were missing quotes..

Hi! I have been looking into this issue. \nIt seems like the regular expression for finding the url in the text editor could use some work. \nCurrently it is this \"[A-Za-z]+://[A-Za-z0-9_\\-\\+\u02dc.:?&@=/%#,;\\{\\}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\|\\\\!\\\\]+\"\nEssentially it says.\n[A-Za-z]+                      ://               [A-Za-z0-9_\\-\\+~.:?&@=/%#,;\\{\\}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\|\\\\!\\\\]+\nI'll take any number of alphabetical characters until :// then any number of alphanumeric, _ -,+~.:?&@=/%##,; and brackets. \nSo to fix your issue we need a better regular expression. \nI was looking into how vscode works, and I'm fairly certain they don't use just one regex to catch the url they have several. \nThe other fix I was thinking of was adding a trimming function to the URLCtrl.cpp file that removes singleton brackets from the url string that it picks up. \nIf anybody has any thoughts or suggestions I would be up for them. Or if you want to shoot me a better regex, I'll change it and fix it. \nThanks. @sasumner from what I found in vscode, is that they have several regex checks and they split the url up into several  parts, eg. (protocol, domain, parameters etc..) and they run each through their own regex. Then piece them together afterwards. \nI don't think this is completely necessary. \nI'm writing up some code to validate the link before creating a clickable one. Essentially trimming the end if it is \"] } ) . ,\" \nI know I use url's when I'm typing notes in npp and sometimes use punctuation after them which in turn gets picked up in the link creation. . @jannick0 @sasumner  Have you built notepad++ from the gitRepo on windows?

I'm just trying to test my code.\nThanks. > @sasumner @PopeSpaceous\n\n\nJust let me know if PR #5108 works for your use cases. I tested it for a small number of samples.\nGiven that unmatched brackets of all sorts are allowed in a URI according to the URI standard, we cannot decide if unmatching trailing brackets are part of the URI or not.\nInserting leading and trailing spaces should not be required any more. ;)\n\n\n@jannick0 The code looks good. \nThere are a couple test cases that I think should be considered too. \nhttp://google.com.    //extra period gets picked up. as well if you replaced '.' with ','\nhttp://google.com)   //brackets still get caught if there's no leading bracket. \nI have a copy of your changes, I'll hopefully create a branch on my repo with some changes that I think could work well. \nLet me know if you get a fix for it before me. . @jannick0 the code that I was writing up had 3 regexs in it for each bracket [{()}] \n\"\\[[^\\]+\\]$\"  For square brackets or we loop through from the back and look for a leading bracket. \nWe have options haha.\n. @jannick0 It looks good! covers the use cases we were looking at. \n(http://abc.com))\nhttp://abc.com)\nhttp://abc.com.\nhttp://abc.com,\netc...\nAwesome job. \nUpdate: Halfway through writing this response. \nAll the links have died and are not clickable.

    "Davidebyzero": "\nI'm pretty sure the implied definition of \"reload\" means there is no undo. Sure you can ask for it...\n\nWell as I said, MSVS already does this. And it's so convenient that I really miss it now that I've started using Notepad++.\nOne example of a way in which I rely on this behavior: Running a script I wrote that programmatically changes the source code file I'm currently working on. If I then test the program and it doesn't work correctly, I need to be able to Undo to an earlier, working, state.\nThere are other scenarios in which I've found this behavior to be useful as well, like with resetting to different commits in git, but I don't remember the exact details.\nIt also just makes me really uncomfortable to lose that safety net that I've taken for granted for many years working in MSVS. There's no good reason not to implement it in Notepad++ too.. > This is asking a bit much...\nHow so? It seems to me likely to be a very small, maybe even one-line, change to the source code. And it's much more logical than the current behavior.. > So you do an intentional act (delete all text) and you are staring at a blank buffer, and then you do another intentional act (close the tab) while you are looking at no data...and you still expect Notepad++ to bother you with a prompt at this point--seriously? I guess you are serious or you wouldn't have typed ~500 words about it.\n\nThe main scenario I'm thinking of is this: I might clear the contents of a new file that I've previously typed some things in, switch to some other apps, do some other stuff for a while, then come back to the empty Notepad++ window later. It'll look like it's just empty and I never did anything in it. So I Close it, and it instantly closes. I probably won't realize at this point that it even had some things in its undo buffer.\nClose can be clicked or pressed accidentally. If I'm juggling a lot of tasks, this could potentially cause the scenario I've described to happen.\nIt's just more logical and intuitive to make it work the way I described it should. When software works in ways that are illogical / unexpected, it makes me like that software less.\n\nAnd I don't understand why you apparently felt strongly enough to seemingly argue that this shouldn't be fixed. As I said, it's probably a minuscule change to the source code, and anybody familiar with it should be able to make the change very quickly. It's more logical that way, so why not do it? It doesn't make sense to stick with poor design decisions just out of sheer inertia. For compatibility reasons, maybe, but making this change is not going to break compatibility with anything. A change shouldn't have to be super important to be worth doing. Details matter.\n\nYou certainly are free to ask for what you want in Notepad++ here...best wishes.\n\nThank you.. Okay, you make a good point :) Actually perhaps the \"New Issue\" template should contain a new field, \"Why is it important that this issue should be addressed?\"\nI mean, I was actually leaning towards shirking the whole \"New Issue\" template, because it did force me to be more redundant in my description of the issue than I would have liked... but then I reconsidered, that sticking to the format might increase the chances of it being addressed. However you're right, it wasn't until you argued against it that I voiced some more reasons why it's important to fix.. Just found out that this can be fixed in Settings \u2192 Shortcut Mapper \u2192 Scintilla commands. The default is for Ctrl+Shift+Left to be bound to SCI_WORDLEFTENDEXTEND; removing this mapping and replacing it with SCI_WORDLEFTEXTEND (and likewise for Ctrl+Shift+Right) has the desired effect.\nI would still consider this to be a bug in the default mapping.. Oh, I guess I wasn't paying attention. Ctrl+Shift+Right is what I had been trying to use lately, and failing each time because I expected SCI_WORDRIGHTEXTEND behavior but was getting SCI_WORDRIGHTENDEXTEND behavior instead.\nWhen I saw today that I could fix this by editing the keymapping, I deleted both mappings of Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right and then recreated them using the non-END versions. I didn't actually check to see if Ctrl+Shift+Left was bound to SCI_WORDLEFTENDEXTEND before.\nI just did a clean installation of Notepad++ in a VM and you're right, only Ctrl+Shift+Right defaults to the END version. So that is doubly inconsistent, and hopefully a bug rather than intended.. ",

The lib and Redist folders won't be completely equivalent, though: Windows 10 on ARM first shipped with Windows 10 1709, so DLLs that ship with Windows 10 and not Windows 8 aren't needed and LIBs for certain old features are omitted.\nOutside the short list of exceptions, though, if it's a LIB in the x64 SDK it should be in the ARM64 SDK. Feedback Hub is the best way I'm aware of for reporting discrepancies and changing that short list would probably require a UserVoice issue to get attention, but as I said I'll ask around to see if the two you noted here are expected. A 20 LIB differential is bigger than I expected.. After some digging, the 20 or so libs are unavailable features on current ARM64 platforms (OpenGL, Hyper-V) or purposely dropped libs. I'm glad the install repair fixed that up for you.\nThe Linker Input inherited value discrepancy is a known bug that is being fixed. In <vsinstalldir>\\Common7\\IDE\\VC\\VCTargets\\Platforms\\ARM64\\PlatformToolsets\\v141\\Toolset.props, you'll find that MinimalCoreWin is being incorrectly set to 'true'.. Windows 10 1709 was the first Windows desktop OS on ARM64, so yes, 0x0A00 is the right value for it.\nI can give Notepad2 a shot, yes, but Notepad++ is my daily driver. (Doesn't Notepad2 ship with Git for Windows as the default editor?). I have a coworker that didn't have much trouble with Boost when he did an ARM64 build of Notepad++ some time back. I'll ask around.. @zufuliu - thanks for the history lesson!\nIt looks like there are already scripts for building Notepad2 for ARM64 Windows. Is it a question of automating it so it's part of official releases? MIvanchev seems to have gotten AppVeyor to produce ARM32 builds, so his experience might be helpful. If it's something else, open an issue and tag me in a comment; I'm happy to take a look.\n@qz3fwd - Wow! Awesome! Do let us know how it worked out. :)\nYour pain around adding LIBs to the linker config is a known bug in the SDK (MinimalCoreWin). It is rather annoying for now but should be fixed with the next SDK version.\nI understand wanting to avoid installer work at the beginning. When it does come up, note that (at least) tip-of-tree NSIS has a function named IsNativeARM64 that lets an x86 installer detect when it's running on ARM64. (My probably-too-thorough version of this trickery involved some arcane NSIS runework.)\n@MIvanchev - Have you asked the greater Notepad++ community if your changes and architecture addition could be upstreamed to the primary project? I'm hoping that at least ARM64 builds will be available on the main site sooner or later, complete with update notifications.\nAlso, I see that your AppVeyor script still uses the VS2015 image. For ARM64 you should need the VS2017 image since that is when the non-beta ARM64 tooling landed.\nAbout plugins: I'm not at all familiar with N++ plugin development. Is there a sample repo the other plugins are based off of? Adding ARM64 support there might help plugin maintainers make the leap. How is the plugin port problem being handled for x64?. @zufuliu - That was what I was missing! I just stitched it into my local workflow. The Release version can open, highlight, and edit CMD, PS1, and HTML files on my HP Envy x2.

    "qz3fwd": "\nVisual Studio 2017 15.9+ and Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0, ARM64 Win32\nNow that\nWhile I'm filing this feature request as a long-time fan of Notepad++, please note that I'm also a Microsoft software engineer whose day job is expanding the Windows 10 on ARM (ARM64, both Win32 and UWP) software ecosystem.\nI use the x86 (\"32-bit\") version of Notepad++ on a regular basis on a Windows 10 on ARM device, and it works very well. There is also a wide variety of compiled plugins available for it. There's a solid argument for not doing the extra work to support another architecture, though I see x64 hasn't been out of the question. :)\nNotepad++ is a wonderfully light application, so the benefits of native ARM64 support are simple:\nLower power consumption\nThe idle loop takes ~0.2% CPU, but I tend to leave Notepad++ running. A lot.\nSlightly better responsiveness\nSeriously, when I started it a few minutes ago typing was just slightly slow to render. I tried again and couldn't notice the difference again. It's slight.\nWith Visual Studio 2017 15.9+ and Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0, ARM64 Win32 is fully supported (no WindowsSDKDesktopARMSupport even). Projects often just need to add an ARM64 configuration to build, the biggest questions being about binary dependencies and assembly.\nI may eventually get to prepping a PR, but in the meantime I'm happy to answer questions about what this requires.\n\nNow that I have some free time, I have finished the build of 7.5.7 for ARM64 using the released VS 15.9 tonight, which I had started back in august. I had put the project on the back burner due to the old boost dependency and ARM64 not being supported well from boost. I wasted about an hour with building boost 1.55 for ARM64 using the boost build process but ended up creating a static lib in visual studio and removing the nuget package dependence from the vs project file.\nBoost config library from 1.58 didn't recognize the latest VS c++ compiler version but that was an easy 1 liner to fix. Warnings treated as errors was disabled.\nThe native build is done: SciLexer.dll, notepad++.exe and NppShell64.dll. Instead of wasting time on the installer I will just copy my installation folder from my desktop to my HP Envy X2 and replace the binaries tonight with the ARM64 builds to test out on a real device. \nHardest part was building boost regex and adding in missing libs for unresolved externals which the linker could not find after adding in the arm64 build configurations and upgrading to the latest SDK. Hope it goes well tonight. I use Notepad++ ALL the time and a native ARM64 version would be awesome.\nNow what about all those plugins?. >  building Notepad2 for ARM64 Windows. Is it a question\nI have Notepad++ 7.5.7 built as a native ARM64 exe and running fine on my HP Envy X2 snapdragon 835 CPU tablet. C++ source files look beautiful on it and it takes up like 0.1% CPU load. A couple points.\nI had to build libcurl.dll from source and there is no ARM support in the curl makefile. Easy fix though.\nBoost version referenced by Notepad++ source is \"old\" and has no knowledge of the VS compiler version. Again another easy fix. I built a static lib solution for the libregex library instead of wrestling with building ALL of boost for ARM64 which is not straightforward, nor well supported. I have always though the boost libraries are not straightforward to build over the last 10+ years regardless of cpu or VS version-they have their own custom build system with several different versions over the years-b2 or jam.... I had to disable the SciLexer.dll signing verification in the sources (as there is no signed ARM64 compiled DLL I am aware of) otherwise the program will not function.  \nI still need to look through the source code and disable startup update check. I got an error message gup.exe failed...... (I didn't build gup.exe but it would have failed anyways since the updated cannot find a newer ARM64 build). I also need to look into building plugins native to ARM64. Maybe tonight.\nAnyone interested in the binaries? I can upload them if any interest-not sure where.\nLong live Windows on ARM.\nIn summary I am LOVING having Notepad++ on my ARM64 tablet. No emulation for me of x86 apps-kinda defeats the entire purpose of the device and kills battery like and performance......\nHappy Holidays all.. Vcpkg failed miserably building both boost regex as well as angle-sadly. Even though I used the arm64 windows triplet the logs showed it apparently still trying to build an x86 version for boost regex. Guess the ARM64 support is very rudimentary. . ",

    "Baptistou": "Concerning your first point, do you suggest to update the current C++ unitTest file, to create another unitTest file or to attach code samples and screenshots here ?. I can't compile the current unitTest file so I created a new file which contains my unit tests and compiles. As a result, I also updated unitTestLauncher.ps1 in order to run the 2 files.. I couldn't use postfix as .\\language\\unitTest would also match unitTest.expected.result. Unless to rename all files, prefix is the best solution.. Maybe I could add a pipe or a if to filter .expected.result and *.result.json files.. For example, when I want to write all function prototypes, or when I create unit tests, or when I write code documentation, I can sometime forget some functions. A count of functions would help me to quickly diagnose this instead of reading and comparing the whole function list.. I already used this export functionality, but I think it might be easier/more practical to add a count to notepad++ interface. Isn't it just calculate the list length ?. ",

    "rillig": "Just to be on the safe side, always cast the argument to ::tolower to unsigned char, and likewise the argument to ::towlower to wchar_t. Otherwise the behavior is undefined. (ISO C99, 7.25.1p5)\nMaybe this whole function can be replaced with CompareStringEx, which already does all of the above code and much more. Hopefully it is fast enough.. This function will be called quite often but is implemented inefficiently. The functions stringToLower, generic_string, sc.getName and shortcut_name.find are called even when the filter string is empty. This is not necessary. A more efficient implementation is:\nif (_shortcutFilter[0] == '\\0') {\n    return true;\n}\ngeneric_string shortcut_name = stringToLower(generic_string(sc.getName()));\nreturn shortcut_name.find(_shortcutFilter) != std::string::npos;\n\nIt would be even better to use a function that compares strings case-insensitively. This would save the allocation of a few thousand objects per key press.\nCurrently there's a bug: if I type an uppercase letter in the _shortcutFilter, I won't find anything since only the shortcut name is lowered but not the search terms.. There's no point in asking for only 127 characters here. If you don't trust the Windows API, you must initialize str[127] to the null character before calling SendMessage. The WM_GETTEXT documentation doesn't explicitly mention whether it copies the null character, so a super-safe bet would be to fill the complete buffer with zeroes before calling SendMessage.\nRegarding the abstraction level: do you really need to work with WM_GETTEXT here? There should be a generic function that just takes a window handle and maybe a maximum string size and returns a string. This function would be useful in lots of other places and would keep this code really nice and short.. This change of indentation doesn't belong in this commit. Plus, it makes the code layout inconsistent. See the switch statement immediately below, which also doesn't have a space.. The TEXT macro is only defined for strings, not for individual characters. You should get a compiler warning here and the program should crash immediately.. This is quite a lot of code duplication. Is there a way to avoid this?. @MAPJe71 Yes, I'm sure that the TEXT macro is only defined for strings. That's what the documentation says.\nBy the way, the same macro can be used as follows:\nTEXT(oadLibrary)(\"user32.dll\")\n\nIt works, but is obviously not correct.. @MAPJe71 There's no compiler warning I know of. I just thought that based on the definition of the macro in the MSDN there should be a type conflict, since the definition there says void TEXT(LPTSTR string). But since it is a macro and not a function, that though of mine was wrong.. @MAPJe71 Just to be pedantic, the MSDN documentation clearly says only for strings, repeatedly:\n\nIdentifies a string as Unicode\nOtherwise, the macro identifies a string\nvoid TEXT(LPTSTR string)\nPointer to the string\n\nJust because it apparently works for single characters too doesn't mean it's guaranteed; see my oadLibrary example, which also works but isn't guaranteed.\nThe documentation does not explicitly need to mention the word only because otherwise this word would have to appear too often and reading the text would get boring.. @MAPJe71 The documentation you cite only talks about the L modifier. It doesn't talk about the TEXT macro. This distinction was my point of argument the whole time. I know that you can write L'a' to get a wide character but that in itself and the knowledge that the TEXT macro is currently implemented such that it produces this sequence doesn't make it valid code. The TEXT macro might also be implemented in a way that produces a compiler-specific string literal that is only valid for strings but not for characters. And then the program blows up. Hopefully during compilation and not during runtime.. @MAPJe71 Ok, you won. That last paragraph is very convincing. :). @cmeriaux No, your code is too complicated. Since you are not really interested in the first character of the string, you shouldn't ask for it. The only thing you want to know is whether the string is empty. So just ask _shortcutFilter.empty().. ",
