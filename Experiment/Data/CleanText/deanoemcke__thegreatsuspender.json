    "deanoemcke": "Not sure exactly what might be causing this. Can you try updating to the new version which will be released in a couple of hours (v4.60) and report back if this is still a problem?\nIf so, I can do a bit more win7 testing to try and isolate the issue.\n. Closed due to no further activity.\n. Hi. Sorry about this. The fix has been merged into trunk. I have a new release ready to go out in a couple of hours which addresses this issue and many others.\n. assuming this in no longer an issue (as at v4.61)\n. Close due to no further activity.\n. Thanks for the great feedback Mohan.\nI will separate out the ideas/issues above into separate threads so that each can be discussed and handled individually.\n. Hi Mohan,\nThis is a known issue. There was a bug in the previous version where it was marking the page as closed if it was suspended at the time. hence, the restore was unable to differentiate between an open suspended page (which should be restored) and a closed one (which shouldn't).\nHopefully when you updated you should have been presented with an 'update' page (as opposed to the new 'restore' page that comes up after a restart). this update page had a explanation similar to above.\nThe new restore page should no longer have this issue.\n. I will try to implement this in the next release. Unfortunately, because the current version (v4.61) does not currently record which window a tab was suspended in, it will continue to have this problem until AFTER a new release gets installed. (meaning that you will have at least one more merging issue as you upgrade to the next release).\n. This has now been implemented in v4.74. As mentioned above, after upgrading to the new version the window each tab belongs to will start to get recorded. So on subsequent restarts of the extension, you can now restore suspended tabs based on the window they belonged to.\n. This is indeed what I do on my own chrome before I update my extension :)\nThe problem being that I have no way to warn everyone that they are about to receive an update in advance so that they can unsuspend their tabs. I'm not sure how chrome manages the updating of extensions (for you was it automatic? on chrome restart? or did you manually click the update button?). \nThe session buddy integration could work - I may look into this as a possible solution - but it wouldn't be a solution for everybody.\nI will do some research and see if there are any other options for managing updates.\n. Closing as hopefully the new restore tab should resolve any outstanding upgrade issues.\n. Thanks a lot for the feedback. I'm really sorry that the updates have been quite rough for you. Every time I do a new version, my primary focus is on streamlining this process to avoid any disruption. In this latest release the change was to make the tabs remember which window they belong to and also the position in that window so that when restoring it hopefully looks just like it did before the update.\nIt's normal for all the tabs to disappear after an update, but it's quite worrying that there was no restore option for you after doing the update. And also strange that the history contained no information. You SHOULD have been presented with a restore page that would let you restore all your tabs. \nIs there information in the history tab now?\nIdeally, I would be able to prompt users to update, then do a full unsuspend before updating - it's just that I can see no way of doing this within the current auto-update model that chrome uses for extensions. \nImplementing a session-buddy checkpoint might be a good idea - i'll do some research. However, given the inconvenience it causes everyone to have their tabs disappear, I'm reluctant to put out a new release anytime soon.\nSorry again for the issues. There's no donate button - perhaps when I get it perfect i'll put something up :)\nCheers for the encouragement.\n. yeah, i have considered this. perhaps using github as the provider could be a good idea. i just don't really like the idea that every time a tab gets suspended it has to retrieve something from the internet. \nand of course the other problem is that whatever i do implement won't be available until after the NEXT update to the extension which means there's not really any way to warn people of the next update i do.\ni can post on here, however, i think thats only going to help a few of you. any other suggestions on how to warn people for the next release? i can start collecting email addresses and send you all out an email =D\n. I'm hoping that this issue has now been resolved due to the fact that I now keep track of a users session and attempt to recover the last session automatically upon extension restart.\nPlease note that this will only work AFTER upgrading to the version with this code. So the first time you upgrade, you will still experience some tabs going missing.\n. Fixed in version 5.0.0\n. The latest version has a configurable hotkey to suspend the current tab as suggested by @liamjohnston .\n. this has now been implemented in the latest version (v4.74)\n:)\n. This has been implemented in the latest version (v4.74).\nThe hotkeys to reload a suspended tab are either space, enter, F5 or down arrow.\n. Have you tried disabling the extension and then restarting? If you have any currently suspended tabs, then I would recommend clicking the 'enable all' button first and once all your tabs have reloaded (ie. not suspended anymore) then try to disable the extension and restart chrome and see if you have the same problem. Ideally, it would be good to be able to isolate my extension from your issue.\nIf this does not fix your problem and it really does seem to be my extension consuming your CPU then I can take a look at optimising the code that gets performed on startup - looks like I'll be doing another release pretty soon anyway.\n. just to be clear, when you are restarting your chrome, are all your tabs suspended? or are they in a normal 'unsuspended' state? assuming they are all suspended - do you have the same issue if you click 'unsuspend all', waiting for all your tabs to reload, shut down chrome and THEN try to restart?\njust trying to find out if it is the suspended tabs causing the issue or something else with the plugin that happens on chrome startup.\n. very useful. thanks heaps for that.\nand you said it only happens if you have about 50+ tabs being suspended at the same time?\nso, if you had, say only 20 tabs (or even 10? 5?) then you don't have any problems?\n. also, it might be useful to know which version of chrome and ubuntu you are using.\n. Do you have image preview on?\nIf so, does it still happen if you turn it off? (go to options, turn it off and make sure you click save).\nI have found on mine, that if I have image preview on, and suspend all the tabs at once, chrome will use up one CPU (25%) for quite a while even after all tabs have finished suspending.\nDoes this sound like the same issue?\n. sorry, by preview i mean screen capture.\n. True. Thanks for clarifying this. I have been doing all my testing on a Win7 machine and it seems fine suspending 60+ tabs.\nWill have a little play around tomorrow to see if it's any different on my work machine (i think running 11.10 ocelot). If I can't detect any issues I think I'll go ahead with the new release.\nThanks again for taking the time to answer all my questions :)\n. Tried to replicate issue on a newer version of Ubuntu without success.\nKeen to hear if you upgrade fixes the issue.\n. Closing as it is an old issue and extension has been significantly changed since then.\n. Hi. Thanks for the investigation.\nIt turns out to be a bug in the handler (it's getting called but not finding the target properly). Not sure how this happened but will be fixed in the next release. As a work around for now, you can still set the whitelist items manually from the options page (make sure you click save afterwards).\n. This is fixed in the latest version (v4.74).\n. This has been implemented with the 'whitelist' functionality. You can either add text into the whitelist from the options page, or click the 'add to whitelist' hyperlink from a suspended tab.\n. This is fixed in the latest version (v4.74).\n. not sure exactly what you mean by this?\ni'm aware that on a suspended tab, you cannot view the url at the top of the page. this is an unfortunate side effect of loading html pages within an extension (which is what happens when a tab gets suspended by my extension).\nbut what do you mean by 'when restoring a suspended tab, the url should be refreshed'? as far as i'm aware, once you restore a suspended tab the url reappears?\nkeen to hear more about the issue if you have the time.\n. Thanks for the clarification. I agree that when unsuspending a tab, it should probably fetch the latest copy of the page. I have changed this in the latest version (v5.0.1) to bypass the cache when reloading the tab.\n. There has been another feature request similar to this that has more detail. I will close this issue and leave the other as the main thread for this discussion.\nIn future please refer to: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/136\n. Not much I can do about this unfortunately.\nI guess if you know a particular tab always produces a popup when trying to suspend, then you should whitelist that tab. Effectively making it 'un-suspendable' by this extension.\n. Pretty sure this was a bug that was fixed a long time ago. Closing optimistically :D\n. Do you have the screen capture option turned on? If so, it can be a little CPU intensive if trying to suspend many tabs at the same time. Try turning that off to see if it helps. If there is something specific that you can identify that you might be doing before your chrome crashes that could be useful for debugging. Do you have a lot of tabs open at the time? Are they all suspended or in the process of suspending?\nAt the end of the day, I designed it to PREVENT my chrome from crashing when I had too many tabs open - so if you're finding that enabling the extension crashes your browser then perhaps it's just not the right extension for you. \n. I'm treating this as a duplicate of #30.\nFor all bug reports of this extension causing chrome to crash please add to this other isssue.\nClosing.\n. Are you on the latest version (v4.74?) \nThe whitelist checks for any kind of string match on the individual words in the whitelist (separated by spaces) and if it finds a match, it won't auto-suspend. So for example, if you just typed google.com then it would whitelist any url with google.com in the url (like google search, google reader etc).\nYou can always test your whitelist by going to the page you want to test and click the 'suspend this tab' option from the menu. if the whitelist works, nothing should happen when you click this button on your page.\nUsually, if you use the hyperlink from the suspended page (that says 'add xxx to whitelist') it will add in the exact url that the page uses.\nPerhaps if you still have troubles, paste in some of the url's you're having trouble with here, and i can do some more testing.\n. Duplicate of issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/60\nCurrently looking for beta testers to help me resolve this issue. Please reply in other thread if you are interested.\n. No this is not the intended behaviour. It sounds like the extension has crashed or restarted for some reason. When this happens you should get presented with a tab that asks if you would like to 'restore' all your suspended tabs which should make bringing them back up just a single click away.\nThis should be a fairly rare occurrence - it generally only happens when I push out an update.\n. I have implemented this in version 5.0.0 (after running into this issue just before on github while trying to type a long response to an issue!).\nThanks for the great suggestion.\n. I think I might leave this one for now. Adding these sites to the whitelist should be a fairly decent workaround for now.\n. The latest webstore version now has the ability to 'temporarily pause suspension' for a site. If you have a tab open that is playing music and you do not want it to suspend, you can use this option to prevent it from suspending in the background.\nI will not be doing any work in future to try and automatically detect tabs that are producing audio.\n. Just to reiterate as this is one of the more commonly requested features. Chrome does not provide developer access to its ability to detect which tab is playing music. Therefore I am unable to include an option to prevent these tabs from suspending.\nAs an alternative, I have implemented an option in the popup call 'dont suspend for now' which will prevent the current tab from suspending automatically in the background. This can be used to prevent tabs that are playing audio from suspending.\nAnother alternative is to whitelist the url of the site if you'd like it to always remain unsuspended.\n. Definitely. I would love to have a dedicated option 'dont suspend tabs that are playing audio'.\n. @kirb i have checked out mutetab, and it left me with the impression that there's just too much hackery involved in getting this feature working. i could definitely do as you suggested and catch a large percentage of the use-cases, but i'm worried that it would appear to be a buggy feature as it would not work consistently.\nYou're welcome to have a crack at it, and if it seems to work fairly reliably then i'd consider including it. \n. If i was to implement this (highly considering it), what websites specifically should I be targetting? It seems that the audio/video !paused should be fairly easy. but with some quick tests this won't work for soundcloud or spotify. Any broad strokes I can make to detect flash audio/video? What about soundcloud? And are there other popular sites that I should be testing for?\n. Finally! This has now been implemented :dancers: \n. Available in the chrome webstore in v6.30. thanks for the heads up. i'll give a test on the dev version when i have spare moment. \n. I'm treating this as a duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/30.\nFor all bug reports of this extension causing chrome to crash please add to this other isssue.\nClosing.\n. i have just upgraded to this version. will do some testing and see what comes up.\nas for debugging. if you go to your extensions page and tick the 'developer mode' checkbox at the top, you should then be able to select: Inspect views -> _generated_background_page.html just underneath The Great Suspender extension. Not sure if this is going to be much use to you if chrome is crashing but it is the best place to start looking for potential issues.\nHappy to have a look myself though as well.\nCheers for letting me know.\n. thanks for putting some time into the debugging. from that generated background page, if you click the console button you should get a different view which shows some debug information. ideally, open that page when the extension is running, and then go to the console tab. then, after the crash occurs, paste all the output of the console. hopefully that will turn up something.\ni've been on the new chrome version for a day now with no problems which is a bit annoying (as i can't help to debug the issue). you mentioned that after the crash you have to manually reload all your suspended tabs after the crash? does that mean the suspended tabs don't disappear when the extension crashes? after the extension restarts are you getting the restore screen (the one that allows you to reload all your suspended tabs)? i'm not sure why you are needing to go through all your suspended tabs and manually reload them. does the 'unsuspend all' button not achieve the same thing?\n. Thanks for the detailed feedback.\nJust a few extra questions mohanraj.\nWhat operating system are you using?\nAnd do you have screen capturing turned on?\n. @KoltonG could you let me know your chrome version, extension version, and also operating system? And also, do you have screen capturing turned on?\nHow often is it crashing? And is it while you are doing something in particular?\n. @KoltonG ok. first thing to do is upgrade to latest version v6.16. i'm faily confident this will resolve your issue. due to the nature of the extension, if i force an update out, it can cause users to lose their suspended tabs for ever. because of this, i have disabled automatic updating. you should be able to manually update, or uninstall and reinstall from the webstore. IMPORTANT: make sure you unsuspend all tabs before doing this to prevent them from being lost.\nLet me know if the newer version seems more stable.\n. I have tested this in the latest version and pinned tabs appear to restore as expected. Closing optimistically :D \nPlease let me know if you still have this issue on the latest version (from the GitHub project, not the chrome webstore).\n. For OPs points 1) and 2): This is a duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/11 and has been resolve in the form of a configurable keyboard shortcut which can be set in the options page.\nFor issue 3) I feel that the current semi-transparent favicons work well and would personally not want anything less subtle than that. I may support optional favicon decoration in future, but you would need to open that request as it's own issue.\n@zldrq Your favicon issues may have been resolved in a more recent version of the extension. I will address this in https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/120\n. Hi. Cheers for the feedback and sorry for the late response.\nAre you able to confirm if this is still happening? And why do you suspect it is related to this extension?\nI'm currently in the process of developing a new version and it would be great to fix this issue.\n. Agreed that this is annoying. However, I haven't been able to work out a way of resolving this. Will leave the issue open and will possibly take another stab at it in the future.\n. This seems to work now \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Cheers for the link. I was aware of this method, however it only lets you capture the image of a visible tab, not one that is not selected. \nI am working on a new version (v5.0.0) that contains a new option to set the screenshot quality quite low which should help with memory optimisation while still allow a screenshot preview.\n. Are you suggesting that if you suspend the current (visible) tab, it uses the captureVisibleTab function, and if you are auto-suspending a hidden tab, that it uses the html2canvas library?\nThis would be very easy to do. I just wonder how often people are suspending the current tab - and it may seem odd that sometimes the screen capture looks a certain way and other times it's different?\n. In the latest version of the extension, any tabs that were suspended when chrome is restarted will be resuspended automatically.\nIf you are interested in the feature where ALL tabs are suspended on restart regardless of whether they were suspended or not beforehand, please refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/49\n. Did you ever get to the bottom of this? Sorry, haven't been able to recreate it from my end.\n. I agree this is a very unfortunate behaviour of the extension. However, due to the way that the tabs are suspended there is nothing I can do about it. The pages are unloaded by redirecting to a locally hosted webpage that is part of the extension. When the extension is uninstalled, the webpage that it refers to no longer exists, and so chrome removes that tab from the window.\nThe workaround is to 'unsuspend all tabs' before uninstalling. However, I appreciate not everyone will know to do this in advance.\n. To investigate:\n@ronin13 suggests that the chrome.runtime.onSuspend listener never gets called due to the extension using a persistent background page: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/418\n\nThis is because the extension is not using event pages.\nHence,\n//wishful thinking here that a synchronus iteration through tab views will enable them\n//to unsuspend before the application closes\nchrome.runtime.onSuspend.addListener(function () {\n    chrome.extension.getViews({type: 'tab'}).forEach(function (view) {\n        view.location.reload();\n    });\n});\n\nin background.js never gets triggered.\nIt needs the background pages to be converted into event pages as described here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages. This issue is blocked as there is currently no way for me to perform any asynchronous cleanup job after the user chooses to uninstall (or disable) the extension.\n\nHere is a chromium bug report requesting this be implemented:\n- https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19383\nOne possible (very inadequate) fallback is to redirect the user to a url after uninstallation. This will not prevent users from losing their lost tabs, but it could at least take them to a page which could offer advice on how to recover the lost tabs.. @meden i don't think it was marked as fixed? there was a resolution in the form of being able to specify an uninstall url which the user would get redirected to after uninstallation. however, this does not block the uninstallation process. it merely opens the requested url maybe before / maybe after the uninstall has taken place.. @fwextensions thanks for the idea.\nit may well work. i will do some investigation at some point. not for this upcoming release though :(. Hi. Just wondering if you are still encountering this behaviour?\nHave you tried to the GitHub version of the extension? It will be updated on the webstore very shortly.\n. All good. Thanks for getting back to me.\n. Hi. Just wondering if you are still encountering this behaviour?\nHave you tried to the GitHub version of the extension? It will be updated on the webstore very shortly.\n. New version (v5.33) now remembers the scroll position :D\n. Hey guys,\nI am the author of The Great Suspender. Sorry for the lack of communication from my part. I have been working on other projects and this has been on the back burner for a while.\nFirstly, thanks heaps skuda for taking the time to improve my code. And to everyone, sorry for the bugs out there.\nI will try to merge in everyones pull requests very soon as well as address some of the more common feature requests and reported bugs.\nWhile it should be no problem for me to update this git repository, there is one slight hiccup with releasing a new version via the chrome store. That is, whenever you choose to update the extension you lose all currently suspended tabs. I have done this in the past when there were only a few thousand users and it caused quite a big backlash then, I can't imagine how many people will find this challenging now. I have tried to mitigate the issue by having the history section (and the recovery screen) but sometimes this fails to work properly and the user loses all their saved tabs.\nBecause of this I'm slightly hesitant to push a new update to the web store. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I might go about improving this process?\nOh, and benjymous, I'm deeply offended by your comment on my icon. That thing is a masterpiece ;)\n. I have no way of knowing when they might upgrade, and there's no hook in the extensions api that will warn me before they do. Therefore, I can't tell them anything or auto-reload their tabs for them.\nIf I had some kind of messaging system that I could push out to all the users then I could warn them a week in advance or something, but I don't have this either. Git hub is pretty much my only point of contact with users.\nI suppose I could release a new version under a different extension name...\n. When the extension thread is closed, it will also close all tabs that are being run by that thread. The great suspender works by redirecting the webpage to a local html file that is located in the extension directory. When the extension is restarted, all tabs that point to this local file are closed. It's even worse if you uninstall the application as it removes all trace of what these tabs were which is why I have a lot of warnings about this when you first install the application.\nBTW, are you a friend of Richard Littauer?\n. Thanks heaps for the fix to this one skuda.\nI have merged your branch into master :)\n. @scottedwards2000 Just wondering if you are still encountering this behaviour?\nHave you tried to the GitHub version of the extension? It will be updated on the webstore very shortly.\n. I would love to be able to support the native chrome synched tabs functionality, however it turns out to be not so easy. Chrome does not allow me to modify the url to anything other than the extension://.. format, which will always be different across different devices. \nI have just experimented however, with removing the url encoding and I think it will work. Will do a bit of testing to check it out. If so, then as a work around in future, you should be able to just delete everything in the url up until the 'url=' section to restore your original tab.\nInterestingly, there was a brief moment in the history of this extension where I WAS able to retain the url of the original tab, and device syncing worked perfectly. Unfortunately, I achieved this by misusing the replaceState() function and the chrome developers eventually changed things so that this no longer worked. If you're interested, here's the chrome bug report: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=396830\n. The latest version of the extension (v6.30) now supports syncing of the tab titles. Favicons are still unsupported, as is the actual clicking of these tabs - doing so does not redirect you to the correct website.\nFor users desperately in need of this feature, you might want to check out another extension of mine called The Great Discarder. It utilizes chromes native tab discarding functionality instead of the 'suspending' hack used by The Great Suspender. As a result, it is compatible with chrome tab sync and your recent tabs will appear as expected on other devices.\nWebstore link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-discarder/jlipbpadkjcklpeiajndiijbeieicbdh?hl=en\nGitHub link: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatdiscarder. @pruchkin2 It's not really possible at this point. Chrome on android has no extension capabilities.. This has been fixed in the current dev version. Sorry it's taking a while to get out there.\n. Webstore will be updated shortly.\n. This has been implemented in the latest (gitHub) version. It will be released to the chrome webstore shortly.\n. I am treating this issue as a feature request for being able to specify that ALL tabs are suspended automatically on browser restart regardless of whether they were suspended before closing/crashing. This is an interesting feature that I may look at implementing in the future. However it would require me to store favicons and page titles of every page ever visited in order to be able to suspend on startup without actually loading the page first. And screen capturing would be out of the question.\nThe extension should already have the feature that will resuspend tabs on restart that were suspended before closing/crashing. If you find this feature is not working please refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/37\n. Not sure this is really worth doing anymore? Chromes start times seem almost instant now.\n. While suspending all tabs on browser start is not really possible (due to needing to load the tab before it can be suspended), I may investigate the possibility of 'discarding' all tabs on browser start  which (if it is possible) would delay loading of the tab until it gains focus.. As mentioned in issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/263\nthe chrome extension footab actually achieves this by blocking tabs from starting. It might be worth checking out the source code: https://sourceforge.net/p/footab/code/ci/master/tree/src/\n. In issue #655 @dumblob suggested using Native Lazy Tabs for implementing automatic tab discard on chrome restart.\nThis extension appears to be discontinued, however it is still available from this chrome extensions archive.\nFYI: That extension is based on my code in The Great Discarder ;). I did some investigation into tab discarding on chrome start as part of my work on issue: #719. \nThis is not going to be an option unfortunately, which means that lazy tabs is inherently incompatible with The Great Suspender.  \nWhen a tab is discarded it can no longer be communicated with, which means for unsuspended tabs, they will no longer automatically suspend based on a timer, and for suspended tabs, if they are discarded before they can load properly they will be stuck in a 'blockhead' favicon state.\nIdeally if you want The Great Suspender to operate properly, tabs will never get discarded, only ever suspended. \nTo try to ensure this is always the case, there is a setting called 'Instantly suspend when system memory gets very low' which will detect when a tab gets discarded, and undiscard and suspend it instead.\n. There are 3 alternatives I can think of for implementing this feature (suspend all tabs on browser restart).\n1. Force all tabs to suspend before chrome shuts down (in which case they'll be suspended when you restart). This is a separate feature request: #700\n2. Investigate 'blocking' the tab via chrome.webRequest a la Footab (see above)\n3. Attempt to suspend all tabs on startup, even though we may not have any favicon or page title information. This may cause the tabs to show a blockhead icon instead.. Possibly related issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/34\nCan anyone confirm that this is still happening? And are we happy to assume it is not related to the extension?\nClosing optimistically :D \nPlease let me know if you are still having issues with this.\n. merging with #262\n. The latest gitHub version has made significant changes to the visual UI. I hope it's more to your liking! It will be released to the webstore shortly.\n. Related to issue #55 Chrome browser crash on disable.\nWould be interested to know if this behaviour is still being experienced. Anyone run into a similar issue?\n. This should be fixed in the latest version (v4.81).\nNote, this release is not yet available from the chrome store.\n. This has been implemented in the latest (gitHub) version of the extension. It will be released to the webstore shortly.\n. This has now been implemented and can be configured from the options page.\n. Im currently working on a new release and am keen to get to the bottom of this issue. Just a few things to note first:\n1) The whitelist works on urls only so entering in title keywords will not help.\n2) It works on substrings of urls so you do not need to enter in http etc for it to work.\n3) The urls need to be SPACE delimited. It will not work if they are separated with a newline.\nI have already made a few changes to the whitelist functionality, and there is a chance the latest version may resolve this issue. If anyone is keen on beta testing it, you can checkout the latest version of the code and install the extension manually. Instructions to do so are detailed here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/74\nI'm really keen to get this one nailed for the new release so any help you guys can offer me would be greatly appreciated!\n. The whitelist looks for any substring match within the url - so in effect, it is automatically adding wildcards to any whitelisted term.\nClosing this issue as I believe it has been resolved in the more recent gitHub versions of the extension.\n. I have incorporated this idea into a new commit. However, there is no new setting for changing the length of the checking interval. It will remain at 60 seconds unless you have chosen the '10 second' auto-suspend interval in which case it will change the checking interval to 10 seconds.\n. not at the moment sorry.\n. I dont think that chrome extensions can run on local resources (ie: urls of the form file://...). @michaelkolber thanks for that.\nso you're interested in local pdf files being suspendable?\ni would like to do some testing to see just how useful this is (in terms of system resource reduction).. That's awesome. Thanks!. This is actually already the case with the 'Suspend all tabs' option. It will not actually suspend your current tab.\nI have changed the wording of this option in v5.0.0 to be 'Suspend all other tabs'.\n. As mentioned in issue 73 - I plan on a new release in the next couple of weeks. Sorry for the wait!\n. I have (hopefully) identified and fixed this issue in the latest release (v5.0.0).\nIf anyone is keen on beta testing it, you can checkout the latest version of the code and install the extension manually. Instructions to do so are detailed here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/74\nOtherwise the new version should be available soon via the chrome store.\n. Version 5.0.0 includes a new 1 minute and 5 minute option.\n. Reopening this as a feature request to allow the user to enter in their own custom suspend time.. thanks to @rvadlam1 for implementing this feature. the latest dev version now has an optional right-click context menu that replicates the popup menu.\n. I have no plans to port to firefox sorry. Just don't have the time. Also, as @GitHubGeek suggested, I think firefox already has some built in functionality for this kind of stuff, and it doesn't have the memory issues that I seem to get with chrome.\n. Sorry guys. It's been a while but I'm in the middle of developing a new release right now. I haven't released v4.80 yet as I wanted to get a lot more bug fixes in. And there is a considerable overhead to releasing a new version (all currently suspended tabs disappear after the upgrade) so I try to do as few releases as necessary. I'm hoping to release in the next week or two. Would love some beta testers if anyone is keen..\n. Thanks a lot. See instructions here for details on how to set it up: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/74\n. New so far to v5.0.0:\nBug fixes:\n- General issues with whitelist not working\n- General issues with selected time to suspend setting not being obeyed.\nNew features:\n- New option to never suspend pinned tabs\n- New 1 minute and 5 minute time to suspend options\n- Ability to choose low/high resolution screen preview\n- Support for chrome tab sync (should now be able to reload tabs that have been suspended from another computer and synced across as long as other computer also has the new version of the extension installed)\n- New option to prevent a tab from suspending if it contains unsaved form data (actually just a listener for key presses on the page)\nMore to come...\n. gosh. i'm really sorry about that. i introduced an issue when trying to update the version number before i committed. should be fixed now. sorry for the hassle.\n. Hi, sorry. Yes, the current version has some debugging in it that requires the latest release. You can get around this by changing the manifest to not load \"processes\" and \"system.memory\" under permissions. and then turn off debugging and profiling in background.js (set them to false).\nHowever, I am planning on making some quite significant changes in the next few weeks, so if you're looking to beta test, it might pay to hold off for a moment.\nIf you're just after the latest version, then feel free to have a play around.\n. There is a new beta version available if anyone feels like testing it. Installation instructions can be found here. And please report any issues found in this thread.\n. Possible duplicate of issue #60. Closing this issue as I believe all whitelisting issue have been resolved. These fixes will be pushed to the chrome webstore shortly.\n. This feature will be included in the upcoming release. \n@louy2 Are you suggesting that instead of not suspending the tab if offline, that i should actually be saving the content as a pdf and then suspending it? Isn't that what the extension already does if you choose the 'screen capture' option?\n. This feature has been implemented and will be available on the chrome webstore shortly.\n. It is very likely that suspended tabs will add extra memory usage to the GPU process - however, this memory usage should be much smaller than the combined memory of the tabs before they were suspended. \nAre you using the screen capturing option? If so, this may be adding the the memory usage.\n. When a page is unsuspended, whether the text fields retain their text is completely out of the control of this extension. However, I have implemented a new feature that will prevent tabs from suspending automatically if they contain a partially completed form. This should prevent you from losing text that you have typed in.\nThis feature will be available on the chrome webstore shortly.\n. This has been implemented in the latest (gitHub) version of the extension. You can now 'pause' the suspension of any tab from the popup menu.\nThis feature will be available on the chrome webstore shortly.\n. Unfortunately I have not been able to work out a way to modify the url of suspended tabs so that it does not contain the extension id.\nThis problem has been raised before in issue #46. \nThe chrome developers are looking into a possible way of enabling this in the future, but for now it is a limitation of the extension.\n. This is a know issue with the current production version of the extension. I am currently working on a new version that fixes this issue as well as many others. If you would like to try out the beta version, instructions on installing it can be found here.\nI'll close this issue as resolved once the new version is released.\n. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/46. Duplicate of #84\n. Do you mean, an option to unsuspend a suspended tab after getting focus???\nThis has been implemented in the more recent versions (gitHub) of the extension. \nIt will be made available on the chrome webstore shortly.\nIf you meant an option to refresh an unsuspended tab after getting focus (as stated in the issue title), then i'm not sure that's in scope of what this extension is trying to achieve.\n. Duplicate of issue #30.\nIf you continue to encounter this problem, please use this other issue thread.\n. Working on it! I'm hoping to have the new version available on the webstore by the end of the month.\n. Closed as duplicate: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/607. Hi. I'm the developer of this extension. I'm really sorry that I have not addressed this issue earlier. I have had the best of intentions to release an update, but it's very slow going due to many other commitments. While I have fixed many bugs, I am not confident that I haven't created new ones. The current version in it's current state is not, in my eyes, fit for production. Not to mention that there is a bit of an issue with doing an update whereby everyones currently suspended tabs get removed. So I'd rather not put everyone through this painful process until I can guarantee I'm updating everyone to something better.\nMy plan up until this point has been to wait until I get a version that is stable and has a more mature codebase. There are many chrome extension features unknown to me when I first wrote this program that I would like to utilise. I would also like it to be fully compatible with chrome sync so that suspended tabs can be viewed on another device. \nThe current version in development is not a simple bugfix release but rather a complete overhaul. If the overwhelming feeling from everybody is that I abandon this project and instead release a simple bugfix version, then I will consider it. I'd rather not have anyone else fork the project.\nCheers.\n. Yes, most definitely. I would love to have some beta testers. I actually attempted this a while back but everything has changed so much since then that it became irrelevant.\nI will let you know as soon as I have something I think might qualify for a beta release.\nThanks for the support.\n. There is a new beta version available if anyone feels like testing it. Installation instructions can be found here. And please report any issues found in this thread.\n. A more recent version of the extension is now available in the chrome webstore. However, it has not been fully rolled out to all existing users (due to the potential of the update to cause users to lose some of their suspended tabs).\nNot sure if I will ever fully push this out to all users. For now it will be available only for new users or people who uninstall and reinstall the extension. NOTE: if uninstalling then reinstalling, please unsuspend all tabs first. You will also lose any saved sessions so you might want to export them first.\n. This feature has been implemented in the latest (gitHub) version of the extension.\nIt will be made available on the chrome webstore shortly.\n. @mailinglists35 before i made this extension, i wrote another one called 'kill em all'\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kill-em-all/omljhgkjeddhcghmkidaiiiddojhokjp?hl=en\nit does exactly what you're asking for (if what you're asking for is a button in chrome that calls chrome://kill on all your open tabs) o.O\nyou'll be one of 6 users that have it :)\n. @mailinglists35 \nunfortunately, the only way to kill or crash a tab programmatically is to change the url in the omnibar. \nwhen a tab crashes for real, the url may remain, but there is currently no way to force the tab to crash without updating the omnibar.\n. @mailinglists35 unfortunately that api is on the chrome dev channel only. so while you could use it, it would only work on chromes that are running the dev channel version. not really worth implementing imo until the api makes it into the stable release.\n. Yes. It'd be fairly simple. I'd do it myself, but I don't have the time. Perhaps when it reaches stable I'll take a look at it.\n. If you want to display the image on the screen, then it will be in memory. Saving the image to disk will not change anything. And in fact, all the images ARE already saved to disk in that they are stored locally in an indexedDb database.. It's true that if you automatically unsuspend when a tab gains focus, then there is no need for the splash screen. However, wouldn't you only see this screen very briefly before the page begins to refresh? What would you rather see on a suspended tab instead?\n. If I get more requests for this in the future then I may well add additional language support. I never anticipated it being popular enough that it might require other language support!\nThanks for the offer of providing translation. I'll get back to you if russian proves to be a popular language request.\n. Support for Chinese is coming in the next release. If your offer for russian translation is still open then I would consider it, as the groundwork has been done now.. Thanks to the awesome work of @today- this has now been implemented!\nWebstore release coming soon.. I'm not too sure exactly how to go about helping you with this. How are you installing the extension? If you use the gitHub version, you should be able to modify the defaults in the source code. The relevant file is gsUtils.js \nFrom around line 33..\n. I do not know if it is possible to configure extensions via GPO. \nIf someone could point me in the right direction I'd be happy to take another look.. Just to add some information to this:\nThe settings for the extension are stored locally in an indexedDb database.\nThey can be queried and modified with js run from within the extension environment (like the console of the extensions background tab).\nIs this useful?\nPeople have talked about using an ADMX administrative template. I know nothing about this. But if there's something I can add to the extension to make this possible I'm keen to give it a try.. @AtumVirt well that is definitely possible (configuration via uri). but perhaps a bit of a hack? would that suit the use case of others interested in this issue?\n. @louy2 Do you mean the description on the chrome webstore? I already have a link in there but maybe it's a bit hidden as it's further down. Also, if you click on 'website' or 'support' on the left, it will also take you to the github page.\nOr is there another place you were hoping to see this link?\n. This has been implemented in the upcoming release (v5.0).\nIt is also a duplicate of this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/26\n. Sorry for the confusion. This refers to the 'screen capturing' option in the settings page.\n. Hey. Thanks for the offer to beta test. It is most appreciated. I have written a guide to installing the latest version in the wiki: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/wiki/Installing-beta-version\nI am currently just fixing a bug with the suspended tab history. There should be a fix for this on github later tonight. \n. Hey Pasroe, could you please let me know the exact version of the extension and the version of chrome you're using? I have encountered this problem before but am unable to recreate it on my machine. Perhaps it's chrome version related?\n. @Sir-Launcelot \nSorry, I do not understand the question. What do you mean by the default button?\n. @wizonesolutions yeah, due to the sync compatibility feature i have implemented i am no longer able to do this. its complicated but the semi-opaque favicon was getting cached in chrome, and then being used even when the tab was not suspended. im not sure ill be able to reimplement this feature. do you think its really necessary? i think the chrome sync compatibility is probably more important? keen to hear other peoples viewpoint on this.\n. @wizonesolutions The chrome sync thing is some new chrome functionality that lets you see tabs that are open in other chromes on your other computers. In theory you should be able to open tabs from here but it does not work with the current version of the extension. Seeing as it's native chrome functionality, I feel like getting this working is important to ensure my extension doesn't 'break' chrome for users.\nAs for the favicon issue, I'll see what I can manage. Changing the title is definitely an option - although usually when i have a lot of tabs open, i can't see the page titles - only the favicons. I don't think the chrome API will let me do things like the youtube play icon, but i'll investigate that further.\n. @Barleyman Are you sure 'suspend other tabs' doesn't work? It seems ok on mine. Perhaps what it might be is just the first time you upgrade to the new version. The old tabs that were open and unsuspended might not obey the command. But any new tabs opened after upgrading should work fine? Would be great if you could confirm/deny this hypothesis.\nAs for 'suspend all tabs at start', it is something I'm working on. I would also like to see this happen.\n. @stormy-henderson @Barleyman \nHey guys. So sorry but you're right about the latest release not working. It's my fault due to a bad commit. I've been on holiday this past week so haven't had a chance to look at it until now. Hopefully the problem should be fixed. Let me know if you're still having issues.\n. @dingspro i have just added a profiler/debug page which might help you work out what's going wrong. in using it myself i tracked down a few bugs which may have been causing your problems. let me know if they're now fixed. to access the debug page, open a new tab and point it to chrome-extension://xxxxxxxxxx/profiler.html (or just open the settings page and change the word settings to profiler).\nAlso, I have noticed that the latest developer build of chrome seems to break the extension. Looking into this now but should be fine if you're using the stable version of chrome.\n. @Barleyman The same thing started happening to me. It is because I'm on the beta version of chrome and they have just pushed an update that breaks the extension. This is the same issue that caused the extension to crash with chrome dev. It seems likely that this change will enter chrome stable soon, so unfortunately I have had to make some fundamental changes to how the extension works. Try the latest build, it has a fix but it involves reverting back to messy urls. There is a new preference to turn tidy urls back on, but this will probably only work if you are using chrome stable.\nThe version with the fix is 5.26 - Let me know if it fixes your issues. And there may be bugs introduced with my changes. I'll try to address them, but before reporting anything, try doing a refresh on the page first.\n. Thats to indicate that the tab will not be automatically suspended. If you click on the icon it should give you a reason for why at the bottom of the popup.\nPerhaps it's not the clearest. I might just remove the !.\n. @wizonesolutions Have just added keyboard shortcut support (to the beta github version: v5.30). Let me know if it works the way you want it to.\n. @wizonesolutions sorry. it's all pretty loose. generally the current code is always the most up-to-date and bug free (v5.30 is simply the latest commit). i try to avoid committing any in-progress work. i've never worked with tags or release branches before. perhaps i'll look into it. re: suspending even when set to 'never', i'm unaware of that issue. can you confirm it is still happening in v5.30. if so, i'll try to recreate it on my dev version.\n. @wizonesolutions i've have just committed a fix for both the bug when your suspension time is set to 'never' and have also fixed the keyboard shortcuts functionality. should all be good now :D \n. @Pasroe yes. same version number - new code. sorry! i'm not aware of the issue where the keyboard shortcut operates on the wrong tab? could you give me some more detail? is it the shortcut for suspending the currently focussed tab? does the tab that actually get suspended have any relationship to the one that you wanted to suspend (ie. same url, next in the window, last viewed tab)?\n. @Pasroe pause suspending is to temporarily prevent the page from automatically suspending. i guess it's kind of the opposite of a whitelist. a whitelist will never suspend unless specifically told to (your use case), whereas pause suspension will prevent the tab from suspending even though it's not on the whitelist. pause suspension was meant for tabs like youtube. whitelist is meant for tabs which you always come back to like gmail. as for something like jira, are you aware of the \"Do not suspend tabs that contain unsaved form inputs\" option? i use this for jira, so that it will automatically suspend if i'm not actively using the tab, but if i'm halfway through writing a comment or creating a new issue, it will not suspend (it actually just activates the 'pause suspension' option automatically).\n. Beta testing is over. Thanks for everyones input.\n. I've done a bit of research and there doesn't appear to be any way for a chrome extension to detect a change in the power source. \nPerhaps a solution could be to be able to switch 'profiles' in the extension, so when you're on battery power you can change your profile to be more aggressive.\nAlternatively (and possibly easier to implement) could be a button that simply pauses suspension on all tabs so that when you're plugged in to power, the extension will not attempt to suspend any new tabs.\nI'll leave this issue open, but will not implement anything like this just yet. Right now my focus is fixing bugs, improving stability, and getting the extension updated on the webstore.\n. This has now been implemented in the latest gitHub version.\nChrome webstore release following shortly.\n. @X1011 only a little bit of offence taken :) \nimproving some of the aesthetics of the extension is on my list of things to do for the new release i'm working on. i've already changed the icon up-scaling as per this request. \nand i have similar feelings about the use of yellow. cheers for the input. feel free to try out the latest beta version of the extension to see what changes i have made already. instructions for doing so can be found here.\n. @alidan far out. 330 tabs is quite epic. i wonder how much ram that would normally take up in chrome if they weren't suspended? i don't know if it's possible for you to find out but that would be quite useful information. after you've got them all suspended (and hence your chrome's memory usage sitting at 2.2gb) try click the 'unsuspend all' button on every chrome window you have open. after all the pages unsuspend (this will probably take a while i imagine) then check the memory usage of chrome again.\nalso, what version of the extension are you using? if you aren't already and you feel like being a beta tester, i'd love it if you felt like attempting the same experiment using the latest development version :)\nfinally, do you have the 'screen capturing' option turned on? this will probably add a significant memory overhead with that many suspended tabs.\n. ok. just to clarify a few things:\n1) are you saying that when you first suspend all your tabs your chrome memory usage will drop to about 200-400mb, but that over a long period of time it creeps up to 2.2gb?\n2) when i was speaking of versions, i was meaning the version of the great suspender extension. you should be able to see if from the chrome://extensions page. and if you dared (although in your case i might not recommend it) i was suggesting you might like to try the latest development version of my extension which is available by following these instructions: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/wiki/Installing-beta-version\n3) As for closing chrome and reloading it, how exactly are you reloading all your tabs? do you have your chrome settings set to automatically reload any tabs that were open on restart? if so, these tabs should automatically reload as suspended if they were suspended when chrome shut down (hence reducing your chrome restart time - although with this many tabs simultaneously being opened it may push the limits of my extension). Have you heard of an extension called session buddy? I would highly recommend using it in your case. It can save entire sessions of tabs, and they you can reload them (or particular windows from the session) at a later date. It might mean you don't need to keep so many tabs open in future.\n. Merging this issue into: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/613. hey guys. are you using the latest version here on the github repository? or are you using the chrome webstore version? everything seems to work ok for me. can you give me some more info on exactly what's happening and also the version of TGS you're using? cheers.\n. Totally understand. It's just that updating everyone who is using the extension is quite a big deal - and i'm waiting to make sure it's all working pretty well before i do the switchover.\nShould be happening pretty soon.\n. @Ashwell That is a good suggestion. I agree that it's a bit vague as it is. I'll see about updating this for a future release.\n. I have now implemented regex support for whitelists. See issue #197 for more details.\nI have also added in more complete whitelist usage instructions as suggested in this issue.\n. @tobyponz \nI don't think it's possible for me to detect whether a tab is playing audio. But in the new version that I am working on, there will be an option to temporarily whitelist a page. It means that if you want a youtube tab to remain unsuspended, you'll be able to pause suspension of that tab for its lifetime.\nDoes that sound like a good compromise?\n. Closed as duplicate of #28\n. Can I get some more info on this? Do the tabs initially open suspended and then reload? Or just load like normal tabs from the very start?\nWhat version of chrome are you using? And what version of the extension?\nAnd most importantly, what do you have in chrome settings under the 'on startup' section: \n\n. @jusefe what version of the extension are you using? there is a known bug with the production webstore version but the latest beta version should have this fixed.\n@seanlaguna what bug are you referring to? it sounds like you're talking about the beta version? I have noticed an issue yesterday if you're running the latest chrome developer version. working on it now. would appreciate more info on the facebook bug if possible.\n. have you tried the newest code (v5.24)? i have just fixed a couple of bugs around contentscripts not getting refreshed properly. also, there is a profiler page that you can use now to help debug. open the options page for the extension, and then change the word 'options.html' to 'profiler.html'. maybe that will help.\n. @seanlaguna i have submitted a bug report, but i don't like the chances of them fixing it. the reason is that i do something a bit unexpected with window.history.replaceState that actually makes the tab think it's on an actual website when it is actually just a local page hosted by the extension. this is abusing what the js function was meant to be used for, but it happens to work great for the extension! not sure what to do about it. should i release a new version that depends upon this functionality? i'm not sure whether the chrome dev issue will ever make it into the stable chrome so it may not matter. then again, it may be seen as a bug in stable and patched up pretty quickly..\n. here's a link to the bug i submitted: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=396830\nthe replaceState stuff happens in suspended.js. that's basically the js for any suspended page. and the html for it is in suspended.html.\n. Cheers for the input. Yeah, I used to unsuspend tabs using the encoded url - that's why it's there in the first place, but I switched to using replaceState specifically because it means chrome's synched history works (the extension url is different on each machine so those urls don't work across chrome sync). Also there's another real bonus of using replaceState - if the extension crashes or is upgraded, it doesn't automatically close all the suspended tabs as it thinks they're not related to the extension. Try it on your version, you'll find that if you reload the extension, all your suspended tabs disappear.\nAs for your other comments:\n1. I took the listener out of suspended.js as i want those suspended pages to be as light as possible. If they all have listeners on them (and some people have hundreds of suspended tabs), then it adds up to extra memory usage and that's against the whole point of the program. Besides, there's really no need for that code given that you can call a simple reload on it (assuming that replaceState works).\n2. Thanks for the heads up about the 'suspend other tabs' bug. You are correct. I have made a fix for this by checking for input in the contentscript.js just before the tab is suspended.\nThanks for taking the time to look over the code. A lot of what you are suggesting is pretty much how the current production version of the extension works. I am trying in this new version to move towards replaceState to create a more elegant solution where the urls remain in tact, thereby everything synching nicely with chrome sync. And also the added benefit of suspended tabs not disappearing. However it comes at the cost of potentially not being supported in future, and also not being able to use custom favicons anymore (as they get cached against the url).\n. @oherman sorry for the delay. could you please let me know the version of the extension that you are using? you can find this from the chrome-extensions:// page.\n. @oherman yeah, that's a known issue with 4.74 (the one currently on the chrome webstore) as mentioned in issue #82. it has been fixed in the current beta release but it's taking a while to make it to the webstore. try the new beta version if you're interested.\n. Yeah. I recommend session buddy (chrome extension) for attempting Great Suspender upgrades. It's what I use and it works well.\n. thanks @zldrq . i also recommend the extension session buddy to save a record of all your open tabs and windows.\n@niutech this extension will hibernate your tabs once you turn on that functionality within the extension. when restarting from a chrome crash, chrome should come up with a button at the top saying something like 'restore'. if you click on this, it should reopen all you hibernated tabs still in a hibernated state (note: this only works if you still have the extension installed).\n. This has now been fixed. That is, the unsuspension caused by the accidental focus gained after closing a neighbouring tab.\nI will not address the other issue (clicking to remove the popup) as it's more difficult to address and also, there is an alternative of NOT clicking on the suspended tab to remove the popup.\n. Available in the chrome webstore in v6.30. This functionality was reverted in v7. See this issue for more information: #519.\nI have opened another new issue that suggests this functionality should be configurable: #747. Cheers. I'll look into the licensing. I just haven't got around to it yet.\n. It is now \"Available under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2\"\nAs mentioned at the top of the main files.\n. @mlinksva thanks for this. it's been the bane of my life since the initial release :) can't believe i haven't gotten round to changing that yet.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/49.\nPlease add any new comments to that issue.\n. @GitHubGeek it's a pretty awesome idea. very 'power user' focussed though. if i was going to undertake a project like that, i'd probably make it a whole new extension as it no longer focuses purely on minimising the memory footprint. \n. sorry guys. this issue should now be resolved in the latest gitHub version.\n. Cheers for the contribution. I think i'll remove the button and maybe just apply the cleanup in the background when a new site is whitelisted.\n. @lardissone I'm pretty sure there are already a few users on Opera. What issues are you having specifically? In theory Opera is officially supported (as long as it doesn't cause me too many headaches :)\nPerhaps if we can resolve said issues, then I will submit to the opera addons site.\n. (from the chrome webstore - possibly relevant to this thread)\nWorks In Opera Except For Hotkeys\nLove this extension, and works well in Opera. I have several windows and at times over 100 tabs. (I have issues :( ) This avoids the browser from crashing.\nThe path the hotkeys are saved to seems to be a constant to the chrome folder.\nIf you make that browser dependent it would be would make it 100% compliant with Opera as far as I know.\nYou can use the context menus in anyways, so this is just to let you know it works very well in Opera more then anything.. From: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/452\n\nOpera is basically Chromium with a different coat; it will run most if not all extensions for Google Chrome (and doesn't -yet- have the increasing set of restrictions Google puts on extensions).\nThis extension works almost perfectly with the current Opera version, but:\n\nI cannot yet say if it auto-suspends as it should but it seems it might not do so reliably for background tabs\nunsuspend does not work when clicking in the window when the browser restored its open tabs after a restart. Unsuspend does work from the menu and also by clicking in the window after suspension during the same session.\npossibly related: suspended tabs do not show an URL. This may be an Opera thing, but it seems like it could be risky. I've noticed the same thing can happen in Chrome and unsuspend becomes difficult/impossible when it happens. Maybe the extension could use a special placeholder URL and register as its handler so that the browser doesn't try to be clever with the URL?. The latest github version supports 20 seconds and 1 minute.\n. Hey guys.\nAre you using the version of The Great Suspender from the chrome webstore? If so, this is a known issue, but the latest version from GitHub has resolved this issue.\nI'm hoping to push the new version to the chrome webstore fairly shortly.\n. Yeah. I'm working on fixing this right now. It's a limitation of the chrome.tabs API that you cannot replace a page in the history. I think the old version used to navigate 'back' when you unsuspended. Should have this fixed pretty soon.\n. @Diablo-D3 Unfortunately not. In the instances where a tab is unsuspended by clicking on the suspended tab, it will behave nicely and the page will call window.location.replace (causing the unsuspended version to replace the suspended one).\nIn all other instances of unsuspension though (automatic tab unsuspend, or clicking unsuspend all), it will cause a history item to be created. This is due to the fact that suspended pages do not have any listeners (to reduce the memory usage of these tabs) and hence there is no way to get them to execute js remotely. \n. this is a duplicate of #323 which has now been fixed~\n. Sorry about messing up your tabs!\nThe url convention is actually how the whole extension works - there is no way to suspend a tab without altering the url like I am doing.\nHowever, the tab should reload (unsuspend) when you click on it. It sounds like there's a bug with the unsuspending. \nIn the latest beta version (which you can find here on this github project) I have updated the suspended page so that the there is also a hardcoded link to the original page. This should mean that if you do encounter this problem again, you will at least be able to click on the hyperlinked title to return to your original tab.\n. are you using the latest version of the great suspender from git?\nthis sounds like the issue caused by turning on 'tidy urls' in the options.\nthat option is not compatible with chrome dev or beta.\n. @Greduan thanks for the interest in my project. \n\nis the preference for .forEach() loops just to be more elegant? or is there some performance increase? i was always under the impression that for loops were the most efficient. also, does the .forEach() need to do a hasOwnProperty check?\ncan you also explain a bit what you mean by using iterative functions? an example of a part of my code that could be improved would be useful to help me understand :)\nfinally, it would be quite nice to pull your changes back into my repo. seeing as it's quite a significant refactor, i'll try to hold off doing any commits to avoid inevitable merge conflict nastiness. let me know when you think most of it's done.\n. @Greduan that was code submitted by @WoLpH. it was designed to cleanup the whitelist. essentially turning all spaces into newlines, sorting the list, and then removing any duplicates.\n. > Do you know of Node.js? If yes, are you familiar with it? If yes, how about Gulp or Grunt?\nI have written a couple of small scripts in node before and have heard of grunt but not used it in any projects yet. Why do you ask? I wouldn't have thought they'd really be applicable to a project like this?\n. ah. ok. i use sublime text with the sublime linter plugin (previously just running jshint but will now use jslint).\n. @Greduan i've been fixing up a few bugs caused by the forEach refactor. most notably, you can't return an object from within a loop which is happening in a few places. will commit the fixes on my branch soon.\n. @Greduan  also, i've changed a lot of the forEach() methods into some() methods where appropriate.\n. @Akahadaka \nI have actually already implemented this. Check out the 'pause suspension' button in the popup menu (of the latest github version). It will temporarily pause suspension of the page.\n. duplicate of issue #28.\n. @gargatok it's possible this was just a temporary issue as a result of some of the refactoring done by greduan. all of this (i hope) has been fixed up now. please retest on the latest version (v5.31). let me know if you're still having issues.\n. @gargatok i'm really not sure what's causing your problem. for some reason your settings are getting initialised which should happen when you restart the extension (as you must have been doing when upgrading it). i have made an optimistic fix in my latest commit (v5.32) just incase the chrome.runtime.onInstalled function isn't activating for you. please let me know if this helps resolve the problem. also try just reloading the extension manually from the chrome://extensions page.\n. Sorry. Was meant to say 'for some reason your settings are NOT getting initialised'\n. Duplicate of issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/143\nClosing. Please refer to this other issue instead.\n. @zldrq i feel that the functionality is too niche. i agree it would be useful for a few users, but i don't think many people even know you can highlight multiple tabs.\n. This functionality has now been implemented as part of a pull request from @vinvam (#258).\n. that's a pretty great idea. and totally do-able. im just not sure how much more useful it is than the tab suspending after x minutes? i'm just worried that it's too many options for the user to configure. if you're finding it annoying that the tabs you're visiting are suspended then i usually just extend the suspension timer.\nperhaps i will implement this in the future, but for now i'll leave it unless i get a lot more requests for it.\nthanks for the great idea.\n. I think that it would have to be implemented as an alternative suspension strategy.\nie. you can either:\n- automatically suspend tabs after x minutes\nOR\n- suspend all but the x most recently visited tabs\nI agree that it would be confusing in regards to special case tabs. I suppose in the spirit of the concept, these would be excluded from the x most recent. But also agree with @liamjohnston that this could be perceived as a bug by many who see more than x tabs unsuspended.. There still seems to be a high demand for this. I'll re-add the priority label.\nAn updated possible interface:\n\nCan anyone see any issues with this approach?\nIf a tab timer is up but there is less than x tabs active, the tab will not suspend. But then once more tabs are created, when should this initial tab suspend? Immediately once the x+1th tab is created? Or should it constantly be restarting its tab timer when it finishes - in which case it will suspend between 0 and time-to-suspend minutes.. @supersaiyansubtlety i think dumblob was referring to the first option of shodanx2 not making any sense. your suggestion makes perfect sense to me.\n@shodanx2 the problem with your suggestions (and the reason mine is worded the way it is) is because most likely users will have pinned tabs, tabs playing audio, and tabs with form input. All these tabs will remain unsuspended, but may not be the most recently active tabs. i believe the spirit of this feature is to only have X tabs unsuspendable at any one time, but under your interpretation it would could be X + number of 'special' tabs.\n@dumblob your key option 'Suspend all tabs except for last N tabs opened' suffers from the same issue as shodanx2. It implies N tabs + all the other ignored tabs, which removes the ability to specify a hard number of tabs that will actually be adhered to.\ni'm also not sure about putting the new option at the very top. to me, it seems like it should be a 'negation' rule as it prevents the 'main' time to suspend rule from activating.\ni like how you use 'never' instead of 'do not' (notice that in the most recent github version i have changed all the options to be expresses\nand it's also nice how you bring the whitelist up into the suspended tab rules section.\nHere are some alternative wordings for the new proposed rule:\n- Leave up to N tabs unsuspended\n- Keep at least N tabs unsuspended\n- Only suspend tabs once more than N tabs are active\n- Start suspending once there are N open tabs\n- Allow up to N tabs to remain active\nHow about this:\n- [ ] Tabs suspend after X minutes of inactivity\n- [ ] Keep at least N tabs unsuspended\n- [ ] Never suspend pinned tabs\n- [ ] Never suspend ... (the other 4 options)\n- [ ] Never suspend tabs with URLs from the following list. Hey,\nI understand where you're coming from with session buddy integration. I also use Session Buddy but always reload sessions from the same computer so it's not much of an issue for me. The plus side of reloading a session containing suspended urls instead of real ones is that they load much much faster so I actually prefer to be reloading suspended urls.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible for me to either set the correct url on suspended tabs (this would be a security flaw from chromes perspective), nor i believe, is it possible to change what session buddy sees as I'm pretty sure it is just grabbing the urls for each page - a process I have no control over.\nAre you using the latest version of The Great Suspender on this GitHub project page? The latest version (v5.34) has a history section at the very bottom of the settings page which should show you recent sessions and also let you save and edit them.\nIf I also added an export button to each of these histories would that help you?\nAlso, in regards to high CPU activity, I'd be interested to find out more. Are you using the image preview option? Try turning that off to see if it makes any difference. That is the only CPU intensive part of the extension. Alternatively may well be chrome overhead, but it's hard to know. Any extra information you could give me would be useful. ie. is it a constant 15% or just x number of seconds after a tab first suspends etc..\n. @mahmoudimus i have implemented session exporting in the latest commit (v5.35). i'm really not sure what's going on with your cpu usage. my suspended tabs sit at 0%. have you tried disabling the extension and seeing what happens? i can't imagine it's the suspended page actually consuming that CPU - there's really not a lot going on once a page has been suspended (at least thats the plan).\n@sylwan cheers for the script :)\n. @patrickhealy yes, i plan on getting the latest version into the webstore very soon. \n. @sylwan i have just committed some new code that should allow you to test your cpu issue a bit more thoroughly. if you go to the top of the background.js file and set useClean = true. this will cause tabs to suspend to a completely blank page. if it's still using cpu after that, then there's really something odd going on as that page has ABSOLUTELY no js or even html content.\n. someone has already contributed some code to make this happen. i will hopefully be pulling in the feature soon\n. Implemented via this pull request: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/258\n. Now available in the chrome webstore in v6.30. this is already implemented? just click on the icon and choose 'suspend other tabs'.\n. ah. ok, that's the older chrome webstore version.\nstill, if you click 'suspend all tabs' i'm pretty sure it actually just suspends all other tabs - don't think it suspends the currently active one?\n. ok ok ok. i'm seriously working on it. hoping this week to get it near ready. \ni know it seems to (and does) work much better than the current version on the store. just need to fix a couple of nasty bugs (that you may not have noticed) before i do.\nsorry to keep everyone waiting. the end is in sight!\n. Yes. Getting there. Aiming for the end of the month.\n. wow. is it the 10th of feb already? where does all the time go! working on it. promise.\n. @juristr \nthanks. yeah, i have realised that branches is the way to go. once this initial release is out i will head down that track. it's mainly because this release is a complete rewrite of the code from scratch, so there hasn't really been any iterative feature building.\n. @Corrodias I'm aware of that issue. I'm pretty sure I fixed it a few days back. Are you able to try the latest version and get back to me? The session stuff is really only there to help you recover lost tabs should the extension restart (or update). Other than that you should never really see the session recovery screen.\n. @Corrodias what do you have set in your chrome->settings->on startup option?\nie. when chrome restarts, does it try to continue where you left off? or just start completely fresh?\n. @Corrodias \ni have decided to change the way the recovery works. it will now only prompt you to recover if the extension crashed but chrome remains open. if chrome itself crashes, then chromes own recovery functionality should restore the suspended tabs properly.\nwould be great if you could let me know if this feels more 'right' to you.\n. @juristr \ntry following the instructions in the readme: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/blob/master/README.md\n. @Corrodias \ngood point. i have started a new issue #155\n. I've been doing a bit of refactoring of the storage, and have moved to using indexedDB. Should be much faster now with storing and fetching suspended tab info.\nThere's a new beta available and would really appreciate you guys testing it out. Pending any major bugs, I'm hoping this will be releasable. \nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v6.10-beta.1\n. @patrickhealy what. you don't have the new webstore version yet?\n. @tjharman hah. thanks. sorry it's been such a long time coming. feels good to finally get it out there.\ni've only released to 5% of the users so far so not everyone will be receiving it as an update (not exactly sure quite how that process works).\nwill change it to 100% once i'm sure there's no angry people out there :)\n. @Barleyman it's currently only automatically updating 5% of users. uninstalling and reinstalling is fine as long as you don't mind losing your settings.\n. everybody. i have made some bug fixes after the first wave of feedback from the release. the latest version is now v6.13 and has been deployed to 10% of users.\nthose that have already upgraded to v6.12 will not get a new update screen - they should experience a silent update which will close and then restore suspended tabs automatically.\nif you are in the latter position, i'd like to hear how the second update process went for you.\nv6.13 contains new keyboard shortcuts. and improves the migration process from the older version v4.74. it also fixes some bugs around saving sessions in the session management tab.\n. yes. it will look exactly as before.\n. ok. even newer version is out. v6.14\nhopefully this will be the last for a long while. i've identified and fixed a few edge case migration issues, as well as adding in the ability to delete saved sessions.\nsorry if you are forced to undergo yet another extension reload (and suspended tab close and reopen). hopefully the new auto-recovery stuff is proving to be a smooth process for everyone.\n. A more recent version of the extension is now available in the chrome webstore. However, it has not been fully rolled out to all existing users (due to the potential of the update to cause users to lose some of their suspended tabs).\nNot sure if I will ever fully push this out to all users. For now it will be available only for new users or people who uninstall and reinstall the extension. NOTE: if uninstalling then reinstalling, please unsuspend all tabs first. You will also lose any saved sessions so you might want to export them first.\n. Sorry. That comment was referring to v6.14 as 'the more recent version' (for those still on v4.x).\nI am hoping to get v6.15 (or higher) into the webstore soon, but I couldn't say exactly when yet. Sorry about that! Will keep you posted.\n. Could you please elaborate on exactly how it does not work? Do you mean that chrome on these devices does not support extensions?\n. @frontalot @Zymoloid i have released a new version of the extension into the chrome webstore. i don't have a chromebook to test on. could one of you check to see if the webstore version runs on a chromebook? cheers!\n. Hi,\nHopefully this should be fixed in the latest version (v5.38).\nCan you confirm?\n. @jackterror \nare you using the latest gitHub version of the extension? there is now a new recovery screen that should appear if the extension detects that some tabs have crashed or been closed due to extension crash.\n. @rsunde \ngreat idea. i'll consider this for a future release.\n. While far from the ideal implementation, the extension now supports (to a certain extent) the ability to blacklist. What I've actually done is support regular expressions in the whitelist. To leverage this for blacklisting you could add the following entry (to blacklist all google sites): \n/^((?!google).)*$/\nThis has the following caveats:\n- Any page that does not contain google will be whitelisted. \n- To blacklist a second domain, it must be included within the same regex (ie. you cannot have a second blacklist entry - doing so will have the effect of whitelisting everything).\nI'll leave it up to enterprising gitHub users to contribute their blacklist regexes for others to share from :)\n. I'm aware it's not ideal. And implementing a black list was not my intention with this new feature. But unfortunately implementing a proper black list would take more time than I have right now. I was merely letting users know that there is now a work around for this problem, albeit a complicated one.\n. Just to reiterate here. While there is no dedicated blacklist, it is possible to blacklist sites using the regular express notation in the whitelist.\nI have tested it and it seems to work well. Having the following in your whitelist will whitelist all sites except google and twitter:\n/^((?!google|twitter).)*$/\nThere are two caveats to this:\nIt can be negated by other whitelist entries (having a second whitelist entry of www.google.com will then cause google to be whitelisted\nIn the above example, any url with the word google or twitter in it will also be blacklisted. ie: https://www.reddit.com/r/google/ will be blacklisted too.. tbh, i'm not sure about this. given the low amount of activity on this issue, i doubt there's much demand for this feature, and i'm reluctant to introduce unnecessary complexity.\nif it is only used by a few people, then i think it produces an overall net negative effect on the usability of the extension.\nimplementation may not be totally straightforward either, as there is a quite a lot of code that references the whitelisting, including the UI of the suspended tab itself.\nyou're welcome to do a PR, but just beware that I may not merge it sorry :(. Any luck since turning off graphical preview?\nI'd say there's a high chance that is what is causing the tabs to crash.\nI have just committed some new functionality that should detect crashed tabs in future and prompt to reload them.\nNew version coming to chrome store very soon :D\n. umm.. are you sure you're posting in the correct gitHub project??\n. Hey. Really sorry about this. You're totally right - I did a stupid thing in my last commit.\nThis should be fixed now.\nSorry for doubting!\n. Thanks for letting me know once again :) \nI never really test on brand new environments.\nShould be fixed again now.\n. @niutech \nAre you using the chrome webstore version of the extension or a developer one from this github project? The latest version on gitHub should behave as you are expecting. If it doesn't, I can look into it.\n. OK. I'll close this issue then as I'm fairly sure it's been resolved. New version will be in the webstore shortly.\n. @raarts \nThis request has been raised before (#103). Unfortunately there is no easy way to detect the power source of the computer. Perhaps in future I'll make an easy way for you to enable/disable the extension so that you can manually do this when changing power source.\n. This has now been implemented in the latest gitHub version.\nChrome webstore release following shortly.\n. oops! i think i got it round the wrong way. ie. it will only suspend if laptop IS charging.\ni have just committed a fix to swap this around. either try the opposite (test with your laptop plugged in to see if it still suspends) or do an update and try again.\nalso, if you donate you will no longer get the donation popups. but no pressure :)\n. Can you definitely attribute it to this extension? If you disable the extension does the problem go away?\n. I have just committed some changes to the recovery logic of the extension (master branch).\nIf you have a moment, it would be great if you could test it out :)\n. Yes. I specifically addressed this in my last update.\n. This has been requested before in issue #49 in a slightly different way. Unfortunately, I cannot see an easy way of detecting when a user closes chrome. If someone knows how this might be possible I'd look into implementing this.\nAs a workaround for now, just use the 'suspend other tabs' button to manually suspend the window before you close it.\n. Closing this issue as it is essentially a duplicate of #49. The only reason you would want to suspend tabs before closing chrome is so that chrome loads faster on startup next time.\n. @MarceloPedra \nin regards to removing the url:\ncan you give me an example of the different (but similar) pages you might have open? at the moment it will display the page title (not the domain) at the top of the screen. do the pages you have open all have the same page title?\nit might help you to know that if you hover over the title it is actually a hyperlink to the original page (so you can see the original url at the bottom of the window when you hover).\nin regards to suspend ALL tabs:\nit was actually a really popular feature request to change the suspend all tabs button to only suspend OTHER tabs in the window. it sounds like you are trying to suspend all tabs in all windows? i am curious as to why you are doing this? it doesn't sound like something you'd need to do very often? perhaps a solution would be to make a keyboard shortcut which suspends all open tabs in all windows?\ninterested to hear your thoughts.\n. @equalsJeffH hey jeff. thanks for your very detailed response. what you are referring to is a bug. i had hoped i'd fixed it in the latest release. you'll find that if you unsuspend all your tabs and then resuspend them you'll get all the titles.\ni'm not sure at this point whether it's only something that is happening during the upgrade process or if it's an ongoing problem. could you please try doing what i suggested (if feasible for you) and then let me know if you continue to find tabs losing the tab title when they are suspended?\n. @equalsJeffH thanks for confirming that. could you please let me know if you notice any NEW tabs being suspended without displaying the proper title? would be good to know if there is still a bug out there.\nre: 'suspend other tabs'. i made it just the current window to err on the safe side. however the text 'suspend other tabs in this window' was too wordy, so i left out the window part. if you go to the keyboard shortcuts section (in settings) you can actually set keyboard shortcuts for suspend/unsuspend all tabs in all windows. but this functionality is only available through keyboard shortcut.\n. @equalsJeffH are you referring to the title not displaying bug? if so, i suspect it may have just been a migration bug in which case it should no longer be an issue so there is no plans to fix it at this point. unless you find it starts happening with newly suspended tabs..\n. @dckidd @weslymoore hey guys. really sorry that the upgrade process did not go smoothly for you. i have been aware for a long time that this update was going to be problematic for some people - this is because chrome automatically updates extensions without warning and in doing so, closes and restarts the extension. this causes all currently suspended tabs to close and the old version of the extension had no way of knowing which tabs they were.\ni have identified a few issues in the latest version that have caused the session management tab to not operate correctly. this has been corrected in a new version (just pushed live - v6.13). it may help you to work out which tabs you lost during the update.\ni'd like to also mention that future releases of the extension should be much smoother and all tabs will be restored instantly. \nlet me know if you have any questions about this.\n. there's really no way to let anyone know in advance. active visitors to this gitHub project were aware. and the only other way to let users know is well, via an update of the extension, which is what caused the problem.\ni'm aware it's a big pain, which is why i made sure this time round that i can perform a full recovery on subsequent updates. try it out if you want. go into chrome://extensions and then disable the extension (all your suspended tabs will disappear) and then re-enable the extension (all the suspended tabs come back in the same location/windows). it should make subsequent updates seamless for everyone.\nas many people are aware on this gitHub project page, this update has been a looooong time coming. this is primarily because i didn't want to put everybody through this pain. and when i did, i wanted to make sure it was going to be worth it. it had to happen at some point. there were some major bugs that needed to be addressed.\n. all known session history bugs should be fixed in the most recent version (v6.14).\nnote: this does not cover tabs lost during the update process - that issue was out of my control for this release, but future releases will not exhibit the same issue.\n. @dckidd @weslymoore \nsorry about the random update process. i'm working on a stable v6.15 and don't want to roll it out across the board until it's ready. until then you'll be stuck on your current version.\nhowever, you should be able to uninstall and then reinstall v6.14 from the chrome webstore. this should be pretty stable. just make sure you unsuspend all tabs first before uninstalling to prevent losing them again!\nyou should be able to go to the session history section in the settings page and restore any or all tabs from that list. is that not working for you? try after updating to v6.14 and see if that makes a difference.\nsorry for the hassle, there really was no way of knowing which tabs were open when the extension upgraded - it only recorded the tabs at the time they were suspended so doesn't know if they were subsequently closed or if they were still open.\n. @weslymoore an uninstall/reinstall will lose all your session history (if by session history you mean the sessions listed in the great suspender session tab). \nunfortunately I'm not sure if i'll fully rollout v6.15 to existing users at this point as I'm worried about the impact it has on everybody.\nare you still looking for a way to recover your session? if so, I can probably give you some custom code that you can run in a console to recover your tabs which will then allow you to do an uninstall/reinstall without losing anything..\n. @dckidd just to clarify - in the saved session you can see, do the 'resuspend' and 'reload' buttons not do anything? also, what happens when you click on one of the actual tab links within that session?\nare you savvy with the chrome console? it would be great to try to debug the issue - that might be the easiest way to get things working for you.\nto debug: on the extension session management page, bring up the console (F12 on your keyboard) and then try to click the 'resuspend' or 'reload' links. you should see some errors come up in red if things aren't working properly. \ncopy and paste the errors if possible and we can go from there..\n. @Mister-Bill what do you see when you go to the extensions 'session management' section? it should retain a more complete view of your tabs including suspended ones.\n. I feel that the option to 'temporarily pause suspension' is a good workaround for this. It's these kind of use-cases that the option was written to handle. \nAlso, without looking into it too much, I'm pretty sure I can't detect whether the developer tools is open.\nWhitelisting is another option - The whitelist works purely by string comparison of the url. So you can add any string to your whitelist that uniquely identifies the site you are developing. \nAdding localhost to your whitelist should also work quite well.\n. @joepie91 actually, the pausing is just for the active tab. it looks like the link you posted will detect when dev tools is open in its own window, but doesn't help to detect if dev tools is embedded in an actual tab - which is what I assume you're after?\n. @joepie91 They do. But I'm not sure how this helps? To implement this functionality, you would need to have some js that you could run inside the console of a tab that returned whether devtools was open for that tab. Does that make sense? There may well be some obvious code for this, I just am not aware of it.\n. it seems a small number of people have been affected by this bug. i'm currently working on a fix. will keep you posted.\n. @coder65535 it was be great if you could try something for me. Try going to the main extensions page and restart the extension. Does this fix the problem? If not, can you try turning on the developer mode in extensions, then open the background page for this extension, restart the extension, and report any errors you see in the background page console? Let me know if you need help with any of this stuff. Cheers.\n. @coder65535 i'm really sorry. i should have told you to unsuspend all first! just assumed that because it wasn't working you wouldn't have had any suspended tabs.\ni suspect that simply restarting the extension would have worked as opposed to uninstalling and reinstalling. nevermind, glad it's all working now. \n. @coder65535 no, don't worry about all the testing stuff anymore. now that you've got a working version there won't be any interesting test cases to debug. another user has provided me with some errors that i can work with. thanks for all your help.\n. @Prito can you tell me which version you have been upgraded to? there has been a few recorded instances of not being able to save changes to the options page. i am pretty sure this has been resolved in the most recent release (v6.14).\nif you go to settings->support or chrome://extensions you should be able to see your version number.\nif you find you're not on the latest version, then unsuspend all tabs, and then uninstall and reinstall the extension from the webstore. this should solve your problem.\nlet me know how you get on.\n. @Prito This should be fixed in the latest chrome webstore version (v6.16).\nThe update is not automatic so you'll need to do an uninstall / reinstall to get the latest version. Make sure you unsuspend all tabs before doing this.\n. Please refer to this guide on why this happends and how to recover lost tabs: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526. It turns out that the chrome sync issue has not been resolved. I'll try to take another look at this. Note though, that this issue relates to history of other devices only, the history of the local computer does show the proper favicon, title and urls.\n. To continue following this issue refer to https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/225\n. @dmnmsc have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling? if so, it would be good to get some debug info on what is happening when you click the button from the icon. are you able to open up the background page for the extension (you need to enable developer mode in your extensions) and check to see if there are any errors?\n. did it happen to specify a file and line number of the '..gsUtils of null' error?\nwould you be able to try installing the latest gitHub version to see if that has the same issues? it will be easier to debug as well.\ninstructions on installing the gitHub version can be found in the readme of this project.\nthanks for you help with this.\n. Can you try editing the local background.js file - line 16: change it to debug = true;\nThen restart the extension and repeat your tests. Try suspending a tab both with the hotkey, and by clicking the icon.\nThen check the background page and copy and paste the exact output you see in the console of the background page.\nSorry to ask for more info, but I wasn't able to diagnose the problem from what you've told me so far.\n. any chance you could copy and paste the entire console output into dropbox like you did earlier? context around these events would be useful.\n. I'm sorry but I'm really not seeing anything odd here. \nI've just committed some optimistic code that might have an effect but can't really tell seeing as I cant recreate the problem at my end.\nTry uninstalling and then reinstalling the extension from the latest code on gitHub (from the master branch, not the release tag). It MAY fix your problem. Let me know.\n. That's great news. Thanks heaps for helping me sort it out. I'll try to get the fixed version info the Chrome store shortly.\n. @dmnmsc that's weird. it looks like it's not running the javascript when the page is initially loaded. it would be great if you could open this as a new issue. be sure to specify that it's an opera specific bug.\n. @dmnmsc somebody else seems to have a similar issue to yours #173. are you still having problems with this? \n. This has been fixed in the latest version (v6.15). Will be available in the chrome webstore shortly.\nDuplicate of issue #164\n. @norachuga @Schmoba \nSpent  a bit of time trying to find an old version of chrome to test out your initial issues. but it turns out its quite a hard thing to find. might park that for now although it would be nice to know that it's compatible with some of the older versions.\nAs for your new issue, it seems you both have the same problem which is that your new indexedDb database hasn't initiated correctly. \nif you don't mind losing your saved sessions, then you can run the following commands from inside the console of the background tab. \n    indexedDB.deleteDatabase('tgs');\ngsUtils.setVersion('4.74');\nthen reload the extension. after this you shouldn't have any problems.\n. ahh.. i think i might know what has happened. if you upgraded the extension while on an old version of chrome that did not support indexedDB then the database doesn't get created.\nafter upgrading chrome, your browser now supports indexedDB but you don't go through the upgrade process a second time.\nthe code I posted should fix this for you both. it essentially tells the extension to rerun the upgrade process.\nwould love to hear if this works for you.\nmeanwhile i'll try to think of a fix for this to prevent it from happening to anyone else.\n. @norachuga sorry about that. i renamed that function for clarity in v6.15 to setLastVersion() which is why it didn't work for you. \n@Schmoba thanks for the great idea. i will def try out portable chrome. do you happen to know the version you were using initially?\n. @Schmoba can't seem to find an old portable version of chrome. any chance you could share your copy?\n. Can you use drop box or google drive? Or even something like mega.\n. Thanks heaps. I've got the file. You can remove it now.\n. @Schmoba I went through a debugging spree using the chrome portable version you gave me. I found a few bugs and have fixed them all. The result is a new version (v6.16) which should be fully compatible with chrome v35.\nTo install this version you'll need to do an uninstall / reinstall. Just make sure you unsuspend all tabs first - and note that you'll lose any saved sessions you've made.\nKeen to hear if it all works well for you.\n. Chrome does provide a nice way of taking screenshots, however that API can only be used for capturing the currently visible tab. Whereas in this extension, I need to be able to capture the contents of a tab that may not be visible.\nThe glitches you are seeing in the image are due to the limitations of the library I use to do the screen capturing (html2canvas).\nThis issue has been raised before #36\n. In the new version of the extension, I changed how tab suspension works (it is now performed by the tab itself via a setTimeout in a content script. \nThis explains why it will no longer work on javascript disabled tabs. There has been another issue raised from this #176 in which I explain my reasons for the change.\nI may look at changing this in the future but it will need some more discussion. How badly is it affecting you? I would guess that not many people disable javascript?\n. I have great plans for this extension in the realm of analysing memory statistics. However, chrome does not currently have any APIs that allow me to access this data. Or to be more accurate, there ARE apis (specifically the chrome.processes API), but they are only available on the development channel which excludes the majority of users. Once these APIs make it into stable, I'll look at implementing some smarter memory management processes. To be honest, when these new APIs come out, the whole way this extension works will be able to change dramatically.\n. Can you please be more specific with exactly what you are requesting? Are you saying you'd like to add an option to prevent suspended tabs from dimming their favicons?\n. I have toyed with this idea in the past and even implemented it before. But in the end I felt that it distracts from the favicon itself which is so key to identifying what a tab is.\nI may look at implementing an optional styling as you suggested some time in a future release though. Especially if this feature requests gets some support.\n. duplicate of #173 \n. Could you tell me the version of The Great Suspender? You can check from the chrome://extensions tab.\nAlso, I assume that for the 'On Startup' option you have the option to 'Continue where you left off' option set? I am unable to recreate this issue on my computer which is why I'm trying to get more info.\n. Can anyone confirm if this is still an issue in the latest release (v6.30)?\nThanks.. This is most likely a duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/719.\nHowever this one relates to an older version of the extension where the icon just wasn't able to load at all.. The only way to detect whether the computer is connected to a power source is with navigator.getBattery(). This feature is only available in chrome v38 and higher. Does this account for your issue?\n. This has been suggested before in #136 and #19.\nI am leaving #136 open as the active thread for further discussion (and will hence close this issue).\nFor the record, I think this is a great idea. As mentioned in the other thread though, I'm just worried that it will make the extension overly complicated. Happy to hear input from others on the topic though.\n. Firstly, I'd like to separate your issue into two distinct use-cases. The first is putting the computer to sleep then coming back out of sleep. The second closing the browser and then reopening it at a later date. In the first instance, I am aware of this issue and will discuss it further below. In the second instance, I don't believe my extension has ever handled this case. The timer object has always existed in memory only and closing the browser (and hence the extension) will clear this time object. \nAnother point I'd like to make in regards to both use-cases: I think the ideal outcome is to time 'chrome open' minutes. So time spent with the computer off or in sleep mode is not counted. This sounds fairly tricky to implement, and quite different from how the extension currently (or has ever) worked.\nThis is something that I've done a lot thinking about and also some research. As far as I'm aware, a setTimeout call WILL fire after the computer resumes from sleep. This stack overflow thread seems to support this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6346849/what-happens-to-settimeout-when-the-computer-goes-to-sleep\nHowever, in practise I have had mixed results. Sometimes when resuming from sleep tabs will immediately suspend, and other times they won't. And as you mentioned, if it misses it's chance it will never fire again.\nI initially changed the way the timers worked to get away from having a processor heavy background task that polls every x seconds and iterates over all tabs. But I agree that this is an unfortunate side-effect of the change. I could easily implement a setInterval job that periodically ran to check if any open tabs were past their expiry date. However, as mentioned at the start of this reply, I don't believe that this is necessarily an improvement - it would simply mean that tabs all suspended as soon as you come out of sleep. Perhaps a better outcome would be to restart the timer for those tabs that have missed their target.\nKeen to hear your input on this. I have pasted some sample code below that you can run from a console on the background page of the extension. It reports on the time left for tabs before they suspend. Any tabs with a negative time will be asked to suspend:\njavascript\nchrome.tabs.query({}, function(tabs) {\n    tabs.forEach(function(tab) {\n        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {action: 'requestInfo'}, function (response) { \n            if (response && response.status === 'normal') {\n                var diff = (new Date(response.timerUp) - (new Date())) / 1000 / 60;\n                console.log('time to suspend: ' + parseInt(diff, 10) + ' mins'); \n                if (diff < 0) {\n                    chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {\n                        action: 'confirmTabSuspend',\n                        suspendedUrl: gsUtils.generateSuspendedUrl(tab.url)\n                    });\n                }\n            } else if (!response && tab.url.indexOf('chrome') < 0) {\n                console.log('error');\n            }       \n        });\n    });\n});\n. I whole-heartedly agree that refresh should unsuspend the tab.\nBut you are correct in your assumption that I have not implemented this as it would mean that reloading a window with suspended tabs would cause all suspended tabs to reload.\nAFAIK there's no way to tell the difference between a page reload, and an initial page load.\nI think it's important to keep the functionality that allows pages to remain suspended when opening a window - at the cost, it seems, of not being able to use refresh to unsuspend a tab.\n. @Zegnat great idea! tried unsuccessfully to call some window.location code on unload, but then managed to get it to work with an extension message requesting a reload.\nwill try to get this out in a release soon. thanks for your help.\n. This has been released (v6.x). . @zwaa-vengeance which 'button' are you referring to?\n. The upcoming release has a new keyboard shortcut to toggle the suspended state of the current tab. I may implement double click at some point in a future release.. I dont think that chrome gives me the ability to detect a double click on the extension icon (or any tab icons either).\nAlso, I would have thought that having to move the mouse all the way to the browser icon would be much harder than simply clicking on the large space in the middle of a suspended tab?. @zwaa-vengeance this is very similar in nature to your other feature request to be able to double click the favicon to unsuspend. i'm noting that here to keep them linked: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/179\nare you aware that there is a keyboard shortcut for unsuspending a tab? this might be an alternative for you. also, there is a preference you can check to automatically unsuspend tabs when you view them, meaning you don't need to click anything to reload the tab.\n. There is now a reload link in the top bar.\nAnd you can also reload the tab by refreshing the page (using keyboard shortcut).\nHopefully this addresses your issues. This will be coming out in the new release (v7.x). @zwaa-vengeance \nsorry to bring up keyboard shortcuts again. i only mentioned it because the default chrome refresh keyboard shortcut will now unsuspend tabs. so you don't need to memorise any new shortcut. \nalso, i do understand that if you're a mouse-centric user, having to use the keyboard is always going to be sub-optimal. but as kankaristo pointed out, using a mouse comes with accuracy issues. i would have thought that the most important thing for a mouse user would be a very large space to click on. i can't imagine having to aim at a small bar at the top of a tab is easier than clicking anywhere further down?\n@kankaristo \nthe new version shows the keyboard shortcut for suspending/unsuspending on the suspended tab page. so for users that are not aware it exists, this should help.\n. Thanks for the fix @matheod \n. Thanks for the fix @matheod \nBeen meaning to address this for a while :)\n. @sprt What exactly do you mean by tab state? In a way, this is exactly how the extension currently works. It records the current tab title, favicon and (optionally) an image preview, and saves this information to disk. This is how, if you restore a chrome window with suspended tabs, all those tabs are able to reload their favicons and titles without needing an internet connection.\n. huh. that could be interesting. no idea if it's feasible or not. might have a look into it.\n. thinking a bit more about this, it would probably be a whole other extension in itself. one that has already been implemented by many other people it seems: http://superuser.com/questions/470813/make-chrome-webpages-available-offline\ni will probably not go down this route, though i can see how it would be awesome.\n. I have had another think about this and may look at implementing some kind of offline mode at some point. \nHere is a similar related issue: #220\n. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/265. @rattasak This has been requested before in #164. As mentioned there, this has been fixed in the development version of the extension. It will be released to the chrome webstore shortly - however, it will not be rolled out automatically. You will need to do an uninstall/reinstall to upgrade. NOTE: be sure to unsuspend all your tabs before you attempt this!\n. It turns out this does not work as intended. I'm re-opening the original issue to reflect this.\n. @thostby Can you please let me know the version of the extension you are using? Tests on the latest version seem to handle this usecase OK. ie:\n- bookmark a suspend page\n- open a new window and then load bookmark\n- click on the suspended page to unsuspend it\n- bookmarked page loads ok.\n. ok. you are on a very old version of the extension. i have not automatically upgraded users, as the upgrade process causes you to lose any tabs that were suspended at time of upgrade.\nif you want the latest version, you can uninstall your current version and then reinstall from the webstore. IMPORTANT NOTE: make sure you unsuspend all tabs before doing the uninstall. you will also lose any saved sessions you may have made.\n. Not sure exactly what the problem is here you're trying to fix? Can you give me an example of how .innerHTML causes confusion? Save a session with the name ' name ' works fine for me. Or are you talking about the spaces being trimmed?\n. The welcome bug has been fixed in the development version of this extension. As for the settings, it does appear that I could get this working if I switch to using chrome.storage instead of local.storage. I may make this change in future.\n. I mean this version on gitHub. You need to follow different instructions to install it from source.\nThe fix is not yet available in the chrome webstore but will be soon. For reference, v6.16 and higher will contain the welcome message fix.\n. The latest version (not yet in the webstore) supports synching of settings. This will enable you to sync between normal and incognito mode as well.\n@Busimus Could you please elaborate on the current issues you are having with the extension in incognito mode? Is it just that you would like the settings to sync?. The active tab in each window (the one showing when you switch to that window) will never suspend. So if that window only has one tab open, that tab will stay unsuspended. You can force it to suspend however with the option from the popup or by using the suspend tab hotkey.\nDoes this account for your issue?\n. I consider that a worthy feature request. I have raised it as such in issue #191.\nI will close this issue as it is somewhat ambiguously named.\n. This is waiting on release: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/614. This has been identified and fixed. See #194 for a duplicate issue raised.\n. @Ardens Right. Chrome must not allow you to tamper with extensions installed from the webstore.\nAn alternative is to download the source from this repository and install it directly. There are instructions on how to do this on the readme of the main project page.\nYou will then be able to modify your css at your leisure :)\n. @Ardens @cwilliams5 hey guys. could you share exactly what changes you made in your custom night mode? I'm looking at implementing this and want to get an idea of what is working for you..\n. This feature is now live on the chrome webstore in version 6.21.\nTo update you will need to uninstall and then reinstall the extension. \nIMPORTANT: Before uninstalling, make sure you unsuspend all currently suspended tabs. Also, this will delete your whitelist and any saved sessions you have created, so you will need to export these before you update.\n. argh! yes, there's a ridiculous bug that you've just helped me find. looks like a typo. i blame my cats jumping on my keyboard.\ni've made a fix - i'll try to get a new release out soon.\n. @armandsdz there is a new version out on the chrome webstore (v6.16) which addresses the scrolling issue. let me know how you get on.\n. @darsain unfortunately i've had to turn off automatic updates due to the potentially disastrous effect it can have (losing all suspended tabs with no record). i have done this (as you suspected) by only releasing the new version to 0% of people.\ni'm not sure why the developer mode 'update extensions now' button does not do an update, but i guess it is due to the 0% rule i put in place. \nit's a real shame but i think the only way to upgrade is to do an uninstall / reinstall. in doing this, you will lose any settings and also any saved sessions (within the extension session manager). also, make sure you unsuspend all tabs before doing this as they will disappear when you uninstall.\nanother idea, if unsuspending fills you with dread, is to install session buddy and save the current session. this will save suspended urls. when uninstalling / reinstalling you will still have the same extension id, so you should then be able to reload the session via session buddy and all your tabs will remain suspended.\nthis should work :D\n. I believe this is a duplicate of issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/377\nShould be in the webstore version now.. nice work. i tidied up the keyboard command handers to match yours. thanks for the contribution.\n. I also added the ability to turn the context menu on/off from within the options page. Defaults to on.\n. A workaround to this would be to take advantage of the 'dont suspend for now' option.\nIf you click this on your main reddit.com page, it will stop it from suspending automatically. All your other reddit pages will continue to suspend as normal.\nThe whitelist currently works as a simple string match - so adding reddit.com will whitelist ALL reddit subdomains as you have found.\nI can see a use for adding in more complex whitelisting functionality, but am not sure it's worth the extra complexity as long as there are good workarounds.\nHappy to hear other use-cases for this though..\n. Related to suggestion at the end of issue #106 \n. OK. I have now implemented this in the latest gitHub version. Would be great if someone could test it out. To prevent existing whitelisted entries from being evaluated as regular expressions, I require all regex entries to be enclosed in forward slashes. ie: /^https:.*google.com/\nAnything without a leading and trailing slash will be evaluated as a substring.\n. This feature is now live on the chrome webstore (v6.21).\nTo update you will need to uninstall and then reinstall the extension. \nIMPORTANT: Before uninstalling, make sure you unsuspend all currently suspended tabs. Also, this will delete your whitelist and any saved sessions you have created, so you will need to export these before you update.\n. I think this might be behaviour that is pretty specific to your work flow only. There are a couple of precendents that go counter to this idea:\n- Pinned tabs automatically pin to the left indicating that the leftmost tabs are the most important\n- Right clicking on a tab title has an option 'close all tabs to the right' indicating that tabs to the right tend to be less important.\n. duplicate of issue #28.\n. I'm not sure if it is possible to detect whether a tab shows notifications. Will need to do some more research on this.\nAs an alternative, I have implemented an option in the popup call 'dont suspend for now' which will prevent the current tab from suspending automatically in the background. This can be used to prevent tabs that show notifications from suspending.\nAnother alternative is to whitelist the url of the site if you'd like it to always remain unsuspended.\n. This is a fair request. To clarify, information is only passed up once, on extension restart (install/upgrade etc) and it only passes up version number, and the value for some of the options (time to suspend, auto unsuspend etc).\nTo be honest, I haven't found the analytics all that useful so may just scrap it altogether. But allowing users to opt-out is a fair call. I'll try to implement this soon.\n. can you please be a bit more specific about the issue you are having? are you saying that the active tab is also being suspended when you click this button?\n. Closing as duplicate of #273 \n. @mjgiarlo can you please give me information on your chrome version and also your operating system? thanks.\n. Do you get any kind of error displayed? Are you trying to download from the chrome webstore? What url are you using?\n. OK. Can you let me know your operating system and version of chrome. I'll do a test at my end to see if I can replicate it.\n. Hi. I'm sorry but I've tested on Windows 8.1 chrome version 40 and seem to have no problem accessing the extension and installing it. There must be something else going on with your computer that's preventing the extension from installing. Unable to help you much more than that sorry.\n. An alternative to right-click is to click on the extension icon. There is the same set of options in the popup menu.\nMay add a hotkey for this in a future release.\n. Implemented in upcoming release. yikes! really? I had no idea. thumbs.db must be hidden so i've never noticed it.\nthanks heaps for the heads up. you're right, it's a pretty manual process at the moment. i'll take a look at grunt because it's a bit ridiculous the way i'm currently doing it :D\n. Thanks a lot for that. I got part way through installing grunt and reading\nthe documentation then ran out of time. Still meaning to take a good look\nat this and then I do I'll check out your implementation.\nCheers for helping me out with this :)\nDean\nOn Fri, May 22, 2015 at 2:49 PM, Vasyl Zuzyak notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\njust would like ot let you know that I made a first sketch how things can\nlook and behave\nhttps://github.com/ZuBB/thegreatsuspender/tree/grunt\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/209#issuecomment-104742011\n.\n. @ZuBB thanks for all your help ZuBB. i have set up grunt based loosely on your implementation. to keep things simple i have removed the use of 'load-grunt-config' and not moved all the html files into a separate directory (this would have involved unnecessary/unwanted code refactoring). And of course, added Thumbs.db to the ignore list :)\n. Remembering page scroll location has been implemented already. I'm surprised it isn't working for you. However there is one known bug with it (#296) which I will be fixing in the next release.\n\nThere is a chance you have a version pre page-scrolling functionality. You can always try uninstalling and then reinstalling from the chrome webstore.\nIMPORTANT: Before uninstalling, make sure you unsuspend all currently suspended tabs. Also, this will delete your whitelist and any saved sessions you have created, so you will need to export these before you update.\nPlease let me know if this resolves your issue.\n. Closing as possible duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/602. @ArhatEves it is indeed unfortunate that the extension requests such scary permissions. the reason for this is that it requires a content script to be run in the background of every open tab. the main functionality this provides is the ability to detect if the user is part way through editing a form. it also does a few other things like set the page scroll position on reload and capture a screenshot before suspending if you have that feature enabled.\nwhile this means in theory that it could read anything on the page, record keystrokes etc, you will have to trust me when I say that it does not. the extension is built from the source code of this project. if you would like to see exactly what the content script is doing, you can view the source for it here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/blob/master/js/contentscript.js\ni believe that chrome relies on the webstore review process to allow the community to determine whether an extension can be trusted. they say this exact thing here: https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/186213?hl=en\ngiven the number of users this extension has, the open source nature of the code, and the lack of any negative reviews in this respect, i would say you can be fairly confident in trusting it.\n. The most obvious thing I can think of is that it stores the users tab session history in a local indexedDb database on the users filesystem. When you clear your browsing history, it will not clear this session history, although you can remove this manaully within the extension. There is a feature request to turn off this automatic saving of session history: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/587\nOther than that, chrome does a pretty thorough job of making sure the code of the extension itself is never compromised. You will receive an 'extension is corrupted' message if this ever happens.\nI am not a security expert however, so please don't take this as a definite answer.. Just want to add some more information here about the \"Read and change your browsing history\" required permissions.\nThe only thing this is used for is to 'tidy up' the urls in the session history to remove any suspended tab entries. They are always duplicates of the real urls and just clutter up the history if left in there.\nFor more information on this behaviour (and it's limitations), refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/717. @uhuhleuh hmmm.. while i agree it would be nice to be able to distinguish easily between different chrome profiles, i feel like that's a bit out of scope of this extensions purpose.\nfor most users that would just come across as, \"you can customise the background colour of your suspended tab page\" which is not something i really want people to be able to do (because I don't like custom theming in general).. @Zachu thanks for the detailed info. i was not aware that some websites behaved in this way. whitelisting a url will prevent the tab from automatically suspending, however the tab will still contain an extension content script. i would be interested to know why it doesn't happen consistently every time the page loads. I tried out your linked page but can't see anything unusual happening. I guess I need to be logged in?\nAs a workaround, you could load your banking tab in an incognito window (assuming you don't have the extension enabled for incognito). \n. @terado I completely agree with your desired / expected behaviour. And you are correct that there is no disable / uninstall hook available.\nI have thought about including a warning message on extension install and may still do this. But I feel that the chances of this information being properly digested and actually remembered / acted upon when the user goes to uninstall is slim. There is already a button to unsuspend all tabs, but once again, there is no way to direct the user to this button at the relevant time (when they go to uninstall).\nThe fact that the suspended pages are tied to the extension process is unavoidable for now. There ARE local files that get served, but the still belong to the extension process - there is no getting around this. The extension runs in a sandbox, and any functionality it provides is revoked when the extension is uninstalled.\n. @joeytwiddle perhaps you would like to share your bookmarklet on the issue below? I suspect it will need a little tweaking. As it uses uri now instead of url..\nPlease refer to this guide on why this happens and how to recover lost tabs: #526. @zldrq this is a fair request. although i would question your statement that memory is not an issue. i'm fairly confident that the majority of users of this extension use it to solve their memory problems, not their cpu load. i'll consider this for a future release.\n. I have changed the way screen captures work. I have removed the low-quality option - I did some tests and the memory savings isn't significant enough to justify having bad images.\nI have added two new options - capture visible screen, and capture whole page. the latter will give you a scroll bar as requested.\nI am toying with the idea of some kind of offline mode that would allow copying of text - but will address this in a seperate issue if I do implement it.\n. Now available in the chrome webstore in v6.30. @entozoon Unfortunately I think this is unavoidable. You are correct that it's due to the tab's title and favicon being updated. When a tab is suspended, what actually happens is it navigates the tab to a new url. That url initially has a default favicon (as shown in your screenshot). Once the new page loads, it uses js to update the title and favicon to match that of the page that was suspended.\nthe only thing i could do to improve this is to change the default favicon, but it would not fix the 'flashing' issue unfortunately.\n. The extension does not explicitly request a hard reload, so I had assumed that it would be doing cached reloads. As far as I am aware, I'm not able to explicitly request that the page reloads from cache?\nI came across this article: http://addyosmani.com/blog/offline-mode-chrome/\nPerhaps that could be a solution for you?\n. Closed as duplicate of #265\n. I can't for the life of me work out why The Great Suspender does this with rightclick->options. I agree that it is bad form and should be fixed. I'll do some more investigation.\n. Fixed by @mrinc \n. Similar issue but looking at CPU usage: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/448. There is some discussion of how to accurately calculate the memory a tab is using in this thread: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/458\nAlthough, it doesn't seem like there is a way to achieve this. \nThere is some more info here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463374\nLeaving this open in the hope that one day i will be able to implement this.. @RossBrunton @kirb thanks for the heads up guys. it is indeed something i should be fixing up. i'll try to get this sorted in the next release.\n. This was fixed by @liamjohnston in an older version: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/b32abd75ca8b1211e034cfa9ed0d780796b069e0\nthx liam :+1: \n. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way around this just yet. It is actually due to a bug in the chrome application when syncing history: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=491325\n. Making this the master issue for this problem as it has a nice screenshot :)\n. @juddrgledhill this thread is actually discussing the issue of tab titles not being synced across devices. however it appears that you are also suggesting that the tab title be modified as well to indicate a suspended state. there is actually a separate issue already logged for this: #240\n. @thecrazy The problem is that once a tab navigates to a new url, the title that the page has on initial load is the title that the history will store. Changing the title of a tab subsequently will have no effect on the history entry.\nWhen a tab suspends, it navigates to a new url (suspended.html) which has a title of 'Suspended Tab'. The title is then subsequently updated, but this change is not reflected in the history. There is no way to change the title of this tab BEFORE the page loads. It can only be done with javascript AFTER page load.\n. OK. So I said that above, but it turns out that if you change the page title early enough with javascript, it does make it into chrome's recent history. So that's been fixed which is great. Unfortunately, it doesn't work for the favicon though :(\nAnd of course, the url is always going to be a suspended url.\n. This issue covers a very narrow portion of a much larger issue. Specifically, when viewing 'recent tabs' on another device, suspended tabs show 'Suspended Tab' as the page title.\nThis has been fixed and is available on the chrome webstore in v6.30.\nThis does NOT address:\n\n\nClicking on a suspended tab link does not open the page. It instead sets the url as something like: chrome-extension://xxxxxxxx/suspended.html#ttl=<Page Title>&uri=http...\nAs a work around for this, you can manually edit the above url, deleting everything before the uri= part, and it should load the original page for you.\n\n\nFavicons for these suspended tabs are not present. It shows the default 'new page' icon\n\n\nFor the broader issue of tab syncing across devices generally not working, please refer to this issue in future: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/46. yikes! really?! that's fantastic. chrome's support service is totally unusable. whats the deal with pricing for the service?\n. OK. Thanks. \nJust a heads up. I just tried sending an email to support at chromebeat and got the following error:\nThis is the mail system at host c9mailgw10.amadis.com. I'm sorry to have to inform you that your message could not be delivered to one or more recipients. \nI had a couple of suggestions I wanted to put forward to you. What is the best channel for doing this?\n. It would be a great feature, however it may be tricky to implement in practice.\nIn order to find out the page favicon and title, I would first need to load the page and then suspend it (somewhat defeating the purpose of this feature).\nInterested to hear workarounds for this, but for now I'll leave this.\n. I have implemented this in the latest version (not on the webstore yet). The extension now has a new right-click option to 'open in new suspended tab'\nTo get around the issues mentioned above, the newly suspended tab will use the title and favicon from the original tab (the one containing the link).\n. This feature is now available in the chrome webstore on v6.30. . Just an update on this issue. The current functionality of 'open link in new suspended tab' will now actually wait until the tab has fully loaded in the background and THEN suspend it. \nThis is so that i can capture the favicon, page title, and optionally take a screencapture, before suspending the tab.\nMore info of this can be found here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/572. This issue is for remembering the scroll position in the screen capture (ie. the captured screen can be from part way down the page). However it seems a few people are confusing this with the request to remember scroll position on reload. \nThe latter functionality was initially completed in #43 and should work as expected in the latest version (v6.19). If you are finding that it does not remember scroll position on page reload, then can you please raise a separate bug for this.\n. A good suggestion. I will add this to prevent automatic unsuspension if not internet connection present.\nNote that chromes ability to detect whether you are online is a little flakey so this may not always function as well as you would hope.\n. This has been implemented.. Thanks for the feedback. This is a pretty hotly demanded feature - one that is not so simply to implement.\nSee here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/28\nClosed as duplicate.\n. @kzahel interesting idea. it makes sense. i'm not supporting firefox so no problems there. i guess it just needs some decent profiling to test it out in practise.\n. Storing images on the filesystem will not help reduce memory usage, as the image still needs to be loaded into the suspended page.\nThe image data is currently stored in an indexedDb store. This is fine and there is no need to switch to the filesystem for storage.\nI don't think the additional memory usage is actually that high. I have removed the warning.. @DanAtkinson thanks for handling this one :)\n. Closed as duplicate of issue #28\n. This has been fixed in the latest version (v6.19) as per this issue #181\n. @leesei  I agree that screen capturing is not the most obvious wording. However, I doubt that many users would know what a thumbnail is. It's a pretty tech-oriented term. Also, thumbnail to me suggests a very small image, not a fullsize one. Other wording suggestions welcome..\n. The screenshot should be exactly the same size as the contents of the webpage that was suspended. Are you finding something different? Could it be related to this issue #211?\n. Closing this as the confusion was most probably due to a bug (as pointed out by @fcherman ). This is a duplicate of issue #222.\nUnable to work out why this happens - but it only happens from the right-click menu, not from the popup menu. If it is indeed a chromium bug then it will be outside of my ability to fix.\n. Any consensus on what the preferred option is here?\nWhat are the use cases for needing to see this changed title? \nIn my experience, once you get more than a certain number of tabs open, you don't see the title at all. Wouldn't this make any changes to the title a moot point, and also mean that fading the favicon is essential to being able to tell a tab has been suspended? \n. This has been requested before in issue #197.\nI'm hoping to implement wildcard support for whitelist soon.\nClosing as duplicate.\n. Your best bet is to follow me on twitter (@greatsuspender).\nI will tweet when (and only when)  a new release is available.\nAlternatively, I could set up a gitHub issue and post to it when a new release is out. Then you could just follow that issue..\n. It has actually been suggested to me that a Tweet is probably not the best format for release updates (although I will still report this on my twitter).\nI actually have another option of popping up a new tab on users screens which I could use to notify of updates. The difference here is that twitter is opt-in for the user, whereas a tab opening is going to be forced upon everybody.\nI'm actually exploring options for how I can preserve whitelist and session information over uninstall and reinstall. I might be able to store something on the filesystem? Not sure yet but it would be good to make the process a bit nicer for users.\nRe: Kiwis. I'm actually in Montreal at the moment. Moved over here a few months ago. Run into 2 other kiwis in just the last 3 days which is pretty rare for Montreal :)\n. The extension will now (as of v7.0.104) notify you when a new release is available. Unfortunately this will only happen after upgrading to v7.0.104. And also, if your chrome should restart chrome, the update will be forced upon you automatically.\nMore info here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/609. Possible duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/589. It could well be a new dev issue - it happens on mine too. However, I don't think the problem is related to this extension. It seems to be whenever a tab is redirected to ANY local extension url, subsequent sites in that tab will have broken extension behaviour. It seems like a pretty major bug to me?\n. Thanks for the link. Hopefully they'll resolve it soon.\n. Related to issue #240\n. As mentioned in https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/481 improvements to the session management feature are not a priority. \nAs a workaround for now, Session Buddy is a great session management tool and is a better alternative than relying on The Great Suspender. Session Buddy can also import sessions exported with The Great Suspender.\n. So much for that. Session importing has now been implemented: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/d0f0df97bcfcc6567c2f014f5fea1b799d93ab2a. @oshipper What version of the extension are you using? There are a few performance issues in the most recent webstore version (v7.0.109) which I have been ironing out.\nThe latest development build is MUCH more performant (v7.0.147)\nHere is the relevant issue for addressing ongoing performance issues: #793 \nAs for toggling off session management features. Unfortunately that is not an option. This has been requested before near the end of this thread: #781 \nReproduced here for convenience:\n\n...wouldn't it be easier for YOU to add a simple enable/disable killswitch (checkbox) at the top of the session management page so those like me that don't even use TGS session management can disable it? Then if we need to report an issue to you, our report automatically eliminates half the code-base dealing with sessions not to mention all that code overhead that never would need to execute.\n\nAny my reply:\n\nI understand your frustration here. But if there's a bug, I'd rather identify it and fix it, rather than provide an option to turn off some valuable functionality. If said functionality was turned off manually by a user, then when the extension updates all of their suspended tabs would disappear and WOULD NOT come back. This is not really an option.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification on this.. @oshipper 1700 tabs. good effort!\nfor the transition from production to development, you could export a copy of your session from the session management page, and then re-import that file into the dev version. that way you don't need to go through the unsuspending process (for next time ;)\nbut yes, if you want to switch back to the webstore version you'll need to go through another switch over process you'll need to do another export / import.\nglad to hear the performance issues have been resolved \ud83d\udc4d . thanks for the fix :)\n. Thanks for the contribution. However, I don't want to implement the concept of thumbnails so will not be pulling this in. \nI have swapped to using webp though. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. In the latest version (v6.19) there is actually already a keyboard shortcut for doing this (no menu item though sorry). \nGo to Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts and then set the 'Unsuspend all tabs in all windows' hotkey.\n. Closing as duplicate of issue #222\n. There actually already is a delay when switching tabs. However, it is currently set to half a second which may be too short for your purposes. The delay is intended to handle situations where a user is ctrl+tabbing through tabs to get to the one they want. Having this delay time configurable has been requested in another issue: #114 \nAs for the automatic unsuspending of the current tab, that sounds like a bug that needs fixing. Do you mind if I update the title of this issue to reflect that bug, and leave the other open issue to deal with configurable delay times?\n. Contrary to my comments above, I will leave this issue open as a feature request for a configurable delay time to automatic tab unsuspension.\nI have created a new issue for the bug where you cannot suspend the currently focussed tab #274\n. @es6Test Check the option \"Automatically unsuspend tab when it is viewed\". I think there's room here to renegotiate the hard-coded delay before unsuspending a tab. The idea is that casually moving through tabs via alt+tab (or control+tab for mac) does not unsuspend all the intermediate tabs, only the one that you finally end up on. So the ideal delay time should ensure that none of these intermediate tabs unsuspend accidentally.\nWe need to keep in mind however, that some people will click with the mouse directly on the tab they want (or select directly via some other means such as command+number). These people will want that tab to unsuspend as fast as possible, as they know already that it is the tab they want, and any unnecessary delay will just be painful.\nI'll add to this my own personal use of the 'automatically unsuspend' feature. I usually have it off, but sometimes i will switch it on when i'm working my way through a lot of suspended tabs one by one, usually closing each one as i go. In this use case, when i've closed the currently focused tab, the next suspended one automatically gains focus and unsuspends for me. As mentioned above, the shorter this delay is for me the better. This is exactly what I'm doing right now, as I work my way through all the github issues that need attention :P. Unfortunately I don't know much about that stuff sorry and don't have the time right now to investigate. Perhaps somebody else can contribute some information?\nThe extension can be built as a .crx file which can then be manually installed offline as an extension in chrome. Unfortunately there is currently no way of pre-configuring a whitelist. Although there may be in future as part of this issue: #242\n. Duplicate of issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/456\nand \nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/97. Hi,\nThanks for the suggestion. It's a great one which does have a few issues.\nIt is a feature that has already been requested so I will close this as a duplicate of #228\n. The workaround for this is to change your suspend time in options to 'never'. That will effectively pause the extension.. I agree that this may be worth implementing if there is enough support for it.. The whitelist is somewhat flexible in that you can enter substrings of a url. For example, if you enter .pdf in your whitelist, this should have the desired affect of preventing pdf tabs from suspending.\n. Actually, as mentioned in my first response, the old whitelist can already handle this simply by adding .pdf to it. As far as regular expressions go, this has the same effect as .*\\.pdf.*\nThe new regular expression support will enable to you ensure that the .pdf part is at the end of the url. adding the following to the whitelist in v6.21 will do this: /.*\\.pdf$/\n. Thanks for implementing this. Sorry it's taken a while to incorporate!\n. I'm not sure if there's any other way to deal with these types of pages. Usually when a web app uses a confirmation dialog on close, it is because there is something important that needs a users attention. Therefore I should not (and cannot) suppress this message and suspend the tab silently. Perhaps a better solution would be to not suspend tabs automatically that have confirmation dialogs but this would be very tricky to implement.\nLeaving this issue open for the time being in case someone has some ideas on a better way to approach this.\n. @dragon788 What do you mean by \"it will probably think that it was an upgrade due to how often I switch\"? If you really want to replace your current whitelist with the synced one, you could always uninstall and then reinstall the extension on that machine. A new installation will always have the 'Sync settings' option set to true and will sync when first installed.\n@yxliang01 two years since when? the last release was June 2017. the new release is coming really soon i promise! or did you mean it just seems like two years? :D . ah ok. well it's only been 3 months since the feature has been built. i feel that is a more relevant timeframe to be talking about in regards to impatience.. yes sorry :(\nit's tagged as waiting-on-release. Duplicate of issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/49. Merged with #228 (duplicate)\n. There's a few reasons why this is not easy to implement.\nFirstly, saving form input raises massive security questions, and I wouldn't be comfortable going down this route.\nSecondly, implementing offline browsing is pretty huge. It might be a bit too much to try and fit into this extension.. Some links from similar linked issues.\n\n\nAn (outdated) list of extensions that provide offline saving of webpages: https://superuser.com/questions/470813/make-chrome-webpages-available-offline\n\n\nTurning on chromes 'offline mode' with a flag: https://addyosmani.com/blog/offline-mode-chrome/\n\n\n. My current thoughts on this feature:\n- Turning on full length screen captures (already implemented) somewhat mitigates this issue. It is a poor mans offline mode.\n- However, it would be nice if you could at least copy and paste text out of a suspended tab.\n- But actually keeping all those dom elements on the page is somewhat counter productive to the core purpose of this extension, which is to keep memory usage down.\n- Perhaps some kind of 'pocket' or 'instapaper' integration where it can do a 'save to pocket' before suspending?. For potential firefox port, please refer to this issue: #409\nFor opera port, refer to this issue: #124\nI do not currently have plans to look at a Microsoft Edge port. @Plasmmer You say it is easy? What is the porting process?. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/606. Chrome extensions get installed on a per-user basis. I have no ability to circumvent this rule.\n. Can you give me a bit more information on what is breaking in cVim (specifically)?\nThe problem is most likely that extensions cannot function on another extensions tab. All suspended tabs belong to the Great Suspender extension. I don't think there is a way to work around this. But I would need a more specific example to be sure.. The comments on this PR are also quite relevant: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/423\nI think essentially, they implemented the problematic keyboard shortcuts inside The Great Suspender. Not a solution that I think is really correct... @kalbasit you are correct that the problem could be resolve by using an external web address for suspended tabs. this however makes it dependent on an external site being up (as well as having an internet connection locally). It also significantly affects chrome restart time when restoring a lot of suspended tabs. They currently load almost instantly.\nAnd most importantly, it reduces the extension's performance memory-wise which is the primary use case for the extension.\nUnfortunately, I cannot allow this feature request to impact the core performance of the extension :(. @kalbasit this would break a lot of functionality. the contents of a suspended tab would be out of my control. it would be a pretty significant code rewrite to implement.\nPerhaps you could try my other extension, The Great Discarder. This uses native chrome discarding functionality rather than redirecting to a suspended page. Perhaps it will play nicer with vimium (i haven't tried it sorry).. I agree this is annoying. But I could not find a way to turn these popups off either.\nOne hesitation I have about implementing such a feature (assuming I even could) would be that often these types of popups are there for a reason. Because you really dont want the user to lose a lot of typed information for example.. This is a bug in the current version. Will try to release a fix soon.\n. This issue should now be fixed on the latest version in the chrome webstore (v6.21).\nTo update you will need to uninstall and then reinstall the extension. \nIMPORTANT: Before uninstalling, make sure you unsuspend all currently suspended tabs.

It looks like the external message api has been pretty badly broken for a while. This has just been remedied in the above commit and there is now a new api. It has two endpoints which must be called as follows:\n{ action: 'suspend', tabId: 123456789 }\n{ action: 'unsuspend', tabId: 123456789 }\nwhere tabId must be an integer, but is optional. if it is omitted, the action will default to the currently focused tab.\nthe call will return a null response on success, or an error string if the call failed.. @adityabhaskar afaik the current dev build is bug free :touchwood:\nim going to put it through some regression testing this week and hoping for a full rollout by the end of the month. \nthat said, it's not the first time i've attempted this :(. @DanAtkinson yikes. really? that simple? doesn't this mean that each word is treated as a regular expression? isn't there a chance that people will have special characters in their urls that will then cause the whitelist functionality to behave differently? i was going to implement an improved whitelist but was thinking i'd only include supporting for a * wildcard. thoughts?\n. I'm still a bit worried about this. In particular the $ and + and . (period) characters. I'm thinking if limiting it to allow the use of only wildcards (*). Thoughts?\n. OK. I have just committed my own implementation of wildcard support for whitelists. It's based of this stack overflow post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13818186/converting-shell-wildcards-to-regex\nIt supports use of multiple * wildcards, as well as the ? character to represent a single character. And it should safely handle the situation where people have other regex wilcards in their existing whitelist.\n. @DanAtkinson sorry, i've changed my mind :) my implementation really adds nothing to the existing functionality, but a full regex implementation like you suggested will allow for much greater flexibility. \n. Sorry for the slow response to this everybody.

OK. I managed to recreate it (but not consistently). I have committed a fix based on the suggestion in the aforementioned stack overflow question.

See this issue for in depth discussion of this feature request: #136. @qu1cksilver @bro3234 \nThis bug was fixed in version 6.21 of the chrome extension.

This feature is now available in the chrome webstore on v6.30.. A related feature request: #281\nAlso, how about the idea of closing tabs immediately instead of suspending and then closing?\n. Thats odd. I get almost zero GPU usage with a lot of tabs suspended. \nDo you have the image capture option turned on in settings? And what version of the extension are you using?\n. Duplicate of #225 \n. In the upcoming release, the suspended tab page now has the ability to whitelist the specific page or the whole domain.\nThis has been added to the suspended tab page itself, in the header section.. Actually, it has now been moved into the popup menu of a suspended tab.. @dungsaga I do actually have a plan to reenable automatic updates. there is actually some pretty solid tab recovery functionality which i'm fairly confident in. but it only works for people coming from a version of the extension where this has actually been implemented :) \nhowever, it looks like there are very few people on the old 4.x versions now which opens this up as a possibility.\nIf you want to give it a test, try going to the extension management page and disable then re-enable the extension. You should get to a recovery screen which will reload all your suspended tabs.\nI am considering turning on automatic updates very soon.\n. Just an update on my thoughts regarding keeping the extension up to date in the chrome webstore. \nUntil further notice I will NOT be enabling automatic updates on the chrome webstore version of the extension. This is due to the aforementioned issue whereby users lose all their suspended tabs when the extension attempts to update. My reasoning is that the benefits from the newer features and bugfixes do not outweigh the negative experience of having all your tabs disappear and potentially not being able to recover them.\nMy stance on this may change if a newer version of chrome is released that causes the extension to horribly break.\nHowever, I WILL endeavour to keep the chrome webstore version up to date with gitHub. But the newer version will only be available to new users, or users that uninstall the extension and reinstall it. ie. no automatic updates. If you want the latest version you will need to update manually. Hopefully this will help you manage the upgrade and ensure you don't lose any tabs in the process.\nFor those wanting to update (the current webstore version is v6.21 but will soon be replaced with v6.30), here is my suggested upgrade process:\n\nInstall the session buddy extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko?hl=en).\nSave your current session in session buddy, and then (just to be safe) UNSUSPEND all tabs and then do another session buddy save. The reason for this is that the urls of suspended tabs are linked to the extension id, and if this changes for any reason after reinstalling the extension, none of your suspended tabs (from the first session save) will restore properly.\nCopy and paste you whitelist contents into a text editor as a backup.\nNow uninstall and reinstall the extension. This should put you on the latest version.. I have found a way to make the extension update process manageable and will be changing my policy on 'no updates'. See the relevant feature issue here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/609\n\nI will still endeavour to keep updates to a minimum however, as the process will still be a little disruptive.. I was about to write a comment about how this is too hard to fix. Then I had a new idea and fixed it instead ;)\n. This feature is now available in the chrome webstore on v6.30.. @zonch Can you tell me the version of the extension you are on?\nAnd also, how are you trying to unsuspend all. Via the popup menu, the right-click menu, or via hotkey?\n. Could you please let me know the version of the extension you are using? The implementation of this feature was changed in a recent update so it would be useful to know if you have the new or old implementation.\n. Could somebody please confirm if this is still happening in the latest release (v6.30) ?. The functionality around this behaviour has changed significantly in the last few releases.\nSuspend other tabs is only ever meant to affect tabs in the currently focused window. In the upcoming release (v7.x) there is a new right-click / hotkey option to suspend ALL tabs in ALL windows to handle the other use case.. I'm unable to duplicate this. What version of the chrome extension are you using?\nDo you mean that when you click 'resuspend' a single new window opens but every tab is created in that window twice?\n. This is a feature request, as the session restore functionality was never designed to remember the currently active tab.. Yeah, this is intentional - yet maybe not the best idea.  The suspend other tabs function was written to override all other settings (whitelist, pinned tabs, form input, offline etc).\nNot sure if this is intuitive or useful though. Would be interested in hearing other peoples opinions.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/553. I'm hesitant to do make the extension to any more processing than is absolutely necessary. Especially given that the screen capturing is processor intensive. An unnecessary screen capture at the wrong time could proved frustrating for a user with a busy cpu.\n. Cannot reproduce. The above test case behaves fine in current version of TGS and Session buddy.. If you simply click the donation popup it will stop appearing. You do not actually need to donate.\nI will not be adding this requested feature as I feel it's a fairly unobtrusive popup.\nIn future releases (already in this github version) you will be able to disable the popup from within the support page as well.\n. I do send some data to google analytics. But it is only data to do with the extension page views, nothing to do with the webpages you are actually viewing. I DO NOT TRACK your browser history in any way.\nThe google analytics data is just to give me an idea of what features people are using to help me improve the extension in future.\nI also have nothing to do with doubleclick.net. This is most likely being caused by some other extension.\nFeel free to check out the source code here in the project. You will see there is no malicious tracking going on and also no references to doubleclick.net.\n. See here for feature request to allow disabling of google analytics: #202. Just a few things to note here. First, what do you have set in your chrome startup options? Is it set to 'continue where you left off?' If so, trying changing this if you are not actually wanting the previous tabs to reopen.\nAlso, you should not actually see the ruhroh page on chrome startup. This sounds like a bug. Are you doing a normal shutdown of chrome? Or are you killing the process somehow? If you are killing the process and then trying to 'continue where you left off' on restart, then actually I would argue that you want the option to restore all your suspended tabs, and that this page is justified.\nWould like to hear your feedback on this.\n. There is now a night mode.. Closed as duplicate: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/607. This sounds like a duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/265\nPlease refer to that issue as to the feasibility of this feature request.\n@EleanorEllis I have never implemented this feature. Are you referring to screen capturing perhaps?. This has been implemented thanks to @shanedrgn\nIt's still in pull request phase: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/682#issuecomment-386880663\nWill hopefully merge soon.. This has been implemented. Here's is the commit (80513c8). As mentioned in issue #309 I'm not sure I want the url to display permanently.. @PiNotEqual3 Thanks for the contribution. Although I have actually resolved this issue already in my develop branch.\nThe issue was actually just that the 'Suspend all tabs' option should really have been titled 'Suspend other tabs'. Internally it calls the suspendAllTabs method, but this method doesn't actually suspend the currently active tab. And I do not intend on supporting a method that does do this.\nThanks :) \n. In fact, the extension will crash when \"Allow in Incognito\" is selected, whether there is an incognito session already open or not. It will also crash again when unchecking \"Allow in Incognito\".\nThis appears to be standard chrome behaviour. I have tested on other extensions and they all 'crash' as well. The difference perhaps is that when most other extensions reload, there is no visible effect. However with The Great Suspender, all suspended tabs have to be recovered.. Are you still having this issue on the latest version?. @paulirish what version of the extension do you have? and have you continued to encounter this issue or was it a once-off possibly fixed by a chrome restart?\n@boyan-sharic from your screenshot you seem to have a very old version of the extension. unfortunately due to the nature of how the extension works, I have had to disable automatic updates of the extension. the only way to update is to perform an uninstall and then reinstall. make sure you unsuspend all tabs before doing this. and also note that you will lose your settings and any save sessions you might have.\nfor those people have issues with 'unsuspend all tabs' - can you please try performing the operation using the hotkeys (which you can set in from the settings page) instead of the popup menu to see if either one works? If it is the issue referred to by @cisso then the hotkey method should work where the popup method fails.\n. Possibly duplicate of #325\n. Can somebody please confirm whether this is still an issue in the latest release? (v3.60).\nThanks.. @mariospr Thanks so much for the contribution. Good thing done!\n. @mariospr gah! for some reason i never actually merged this PR when i closed it. have just gone through the merge process now. thanks again for doing this!. I have added support for the older style url= suspended tabs as a fallback. I doubt there's really any out there anymore however.. I think there are two things here. First, it was an old bug that caused the title to remain the same as the first one it ever saw: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/539\nThis should be fixed in the latest version (v6.30).\nSecond, there is the issue of not replaying POST requests on unsuspend. I really don't think this would be a desirable feature in general. You can replicate what this might look like simply by reloading the (unsuspended) page after you made a post request. Chrome gives you an alert asking if you're sure you want to replay the POST request. Not the nicest user experience.. You mean, 'if you cant recreate it dont suspend it?'\nI'll change that issue title to reflect this feature request.. This has been effectively fixed by removing the save/cancel buttons on the options page: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/381\n. The popup is now instant.. Duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/262\nThis has been implemented and will be available in the upcoming release :). For potential firefox port, please refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/409\nFor opera port, refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/124. Unfortunately this code doesn't address the actual request: #365\nThis code simply checks for a 'url' parameter is the 'uri' one wasn't found. this was a change made in an older version. Suspended tabs with 'url' in the parameter should not really exist unless the user has bookmarked it from an older version.\nThe needed fix for the request is to detect the webbrowser trying to access a suspended url for an extension id that does not exist. \n. Merging this issue into: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/613. I will endeavour to get this bug fix into the webstore soon. Please see this thread for the latest information on my extension updating policy: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/322. This is in the latest chrome webstore release (v6.30).. I did some digging into this and it doesn't appear that there's any way for me to detect if a tab is currently being cast :(\nIf anyone knows a way to do this I'll happily implement this feature.\nI guess the workaround is to keep this tab focused in your chrome browser. Or open it in a new window and make sure it's focussed in that other window.. @janpio yeah, i've noticed with spotify on my mobile, it seems to be able to continue casting even if i force quit the app.. A slightly related issue regarding extension corruption: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/551\nI will do some more investigation into the effects of tools such as HijackThis on the extension.. I can confirm that JRT removes the extension folder. I think you'll find it does affect it. It corrupts the extension on that computer and effectively loses all your data (and tabs).\nRunning HijackThis did not bring up anything however.\nFor JRT,  it should be noted that it also removed two other extensions: Alexa Traffic Rank and Evernote Web. Both of which are very reputable. \nIt seems JRT is no longer supported. And I don't really know what to say other than, it shouldn't be removing it. I have no idea why it does. But we're probably not ever going to find out.\n. I am going to close this issue, as I'm not inclined to provide support for third party applications that falsely detect this extension as malicious.\nIf anyone can point to a specific reason why this extension specifically would be targeted then I'll be happy to revisit it.. The latest version has this ability. Under the 'support' section in the extension options, there is a link with 'Want to donate again?' which will allow you to donate again :). This has been implemented. Just a purely modeless view now.. The settings are saved to local storage. If you are running all the accounts under a single user, then the upcoming release (v7.x) supports syncing of settings: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/262\nThis means all your instances should be able to automatically pull down the same set of settings. Does that solve your problem?. @IvovanTulden It depends what you mean by different users. The syncing is between the same chrome profile (ie. logging into chrome as a specific user).\nIf you mean different users on the same machine as in, different operating system logins, then you could have the settings all sync, so long as each of the different logins used the same chrome profile. This would have other side-effects however, like a shared tab history, saved passwords etc.. Upon closer inspection, it seems that what you're after is probably what is described in this issue: \nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/97. Sorry about the slow reply on this. Could you please let me know if you are still encountering this issue on the latest release (v6.30)?\nIt seems others have reported a similar issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/449. I have implemented this in a different way: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/c50941a020f9f06cefe7eb4800d5c6df93f89116\nThanks for the PR!. Possible duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/173\n@npt @sldx Could either of you confirm if this is still happening in the latest version? (v6.30).\nThanks.. Duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/136.\nThis feature has been discussed at length in the aforementioned issue. Please feel free to contribute.. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/387Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/387. @Trucido I have always had reservations about implementing sync of settings. Mainly because there is potentially a good use case for wanting them different of different computers. Actually mainly just the 'time to suspend' setting, which I (and I assume other users) use to 'turn off' suspension (by setting it to never). If you have a computer in which you do not want the extension to run, this is a nice way of turning it off on that machine. I could potentially just tweak your PR to sync all fields except that one?\nAlso, in the current implementation there is the issue of merge conflicts on the whitelist. Currently you will be potentially overriding a fully populated whitelist with a completely blank one from another computer.\nIt's possible that both of these issues are not major enough to prevent the PR from being accepted. Would just like to hear your opinion on it first.. @vapier yes. i was referring to the migration phase. and i agree that having the option to disable sync would solve both of the issues i raised. good plan!. @mediochrea While it's true there is very little activity on this project, I do not consider it 'dead' by any means. In its current state it is still fairly bug free, and achieves its goal of freeing up memory usage fairly well.\nThe version of the extension available from the webstore is somewhat behind the code here on gitHub. This is due to an unfortunately side-effect of how the tabs are suspended. Any update to the extension causes all suspended tabs to disappear from chrome. While there is some tab recovery functionality within the extension, I'm hesitant to put the large userbase through this process, given that the benefits of the newer code probably don't outweigh the bad experience of the update process.\nFor now, I endeavour to keep the code here on gitHub relatively up-to-date and bug free.\nI have updated the issue related to automatic updates to reflect what I've written here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/322\n. I took a closer look at your pull request but dont think I'll be able to go ahead with it sorry. I have implemented an alternative version, but it has a few issues that I'll need to iron out first.\nThe main issue is that you are triggering chrome sync's based on the setOption call. This call actually happens many times and was assumed to be a fairly quick operation. Triggering chrome sync repeatedly was causing all sorts of concurrency issues when I tested your code.\nThe implementation I'm working on has a single listener for chrome.storage.onChanged events. However, I'm currently pondering the best way to handle edge cases where a user enables the sync flag. should their settings override all the other computers settings - or should the current computers settings be overwritten? Not a big deal, but an extra UI step which I haven't had a chance to resolve yet.\nI'll keep you posted on this, but should have something committed soon.. Ok. Sorry, didn't realise you'd updated it. That implementation is much nicer. \nDo you think there should be a warning when enabling sync for the first time? Just thinking about someone who has different whitelists on each computer. When you enable sync on the second one, it will override the other..\n. i've merged into develop with a few small UI tweaks.\ni guess it will show up as merged once i merge develop into master?. This PR didn't seem to get closed after merging with master.\nAlso, the final implementation of settings sync is vastly different to what was suggested here. I ended up rewriting it using a change listener on chrome.storage.\nThe other implementation was causing confusing bugs, and i didn't like how synced changes did not get applied immediately.\nHere is the commit with the majority of the sync refactor: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/a4410855eb50d52b0ff5ffb07c3af0cb93c25178. The latest version of the extension has support for regex. See this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/197. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/361. Please see this issue for more information on the permissions required by the extension: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/213. @jer2665 I'm not able to reproduce the original problem (tainted canvas) on the latest release v6.30.\nCan you please confirm whether this is still an issue?. I would expect the new 'Do not suspend tabs that are playing audio' feature in v6.30 will resolve this issue.. This has been fixed with this commit: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/bb867c863243dbd73af33b70df08d181b00d6c82\nWill be released soon. I believe that tab discarding IS enabled by default. But afaik it should only activate when the browser is severely low on system resources. Therefore, I would say that having tabs discard automatically is  a much nicer user experience than chrome crashing or performing very badly due to low resources.\nAs @Diablo-D3 mentioned, this has nothing to do with this extension, and tab discarding cannot be turned off (except manually in chrome://flags). \nAlso, you may be interested to know that I have made a version of the extension which uses chrome's discarding logic. It's called The Great Discarder (i know) and is available on gitHub here:\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatdiscarder\nand on the webstore here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-discarder/jlipbpadkjcklpeiajndiijbeieicbdh?hl=en\nIt's a complete rewrite of the extension, as utilizing tab discarding completely changes the way the extension needs to work. That said, the UI is identical, it's just missing a few features that no longer make sense.. The gitlab link seems to work ok on the latest release (v6.30). Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about this. Chromes extension api gives me no chance to act on an 'extension disabled' event.\nRe-enabling the extension should recover all tabs seamlessly though. Although uninstalling the extension will not :(\nSee this thread for more indepth info: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526. Duplicate: #49.

I'm finding it hard to understand exactly what you are trying to explain sorry. Perhaps a screenshot would help?\nIs this still an issue? What version of the extension are you using?. Full image previews (with scrolling) has been implemented in v6.30. see issue: #217. You're probably best to look elsewhere if you want to be able to save tabs for offline use.\nI think pocket does a good job of this. please see: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/322. This sounds like a previous bug that was fixed in v6.30: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/274\n. The tab recovery system has been significantly rewritten in the upcoming release (v7.x).\nHopefully this will resolve any issues as above.. Please open a new issue if this is still happening on the latest version.. Is this still happening on the most recent version (v6.30)?. @D0nvt possibly a silly question but, are you actually including the square brackets in the whitelist with your example of [/^https:.*google.com/] ?\nThis would cause it to fail as the correct form should be /^https:.*google.com/\nI have just retested the whitelist for regular expressions and everything seems to work ok?. I'm not sure I agree that it doesn't make sense to suspend pdf tabs. From some testing, a pdf can take up a significant amount of memory. Suspending these tabs will free that memory.\nI think i'd rather just leave this to be handled by a whitelist regex.. @mindsocket i think this would be better addressed in a separate issue. something like 'form input not detecting pdf edits'.\ni am still not convinced that it is worth having something specific in the extension to handle pdfs.\nthe usecase of editing a pdf is chrome is fairly uncommon i would say.. duplicate of: #257\nwill not fix as whitelisting provides an adequate workaround.

I've managed to open 400 random tabs and have them all suspend automatically and there doesn't seem to be any issues. \nIt's probably a combination of also have small system resources.

Or ideas you might have for improvement.\nBecause tab discarding is so invisible, it's hard to even tell that the extension is doing anything except that tabs that are discarded will reload when they gain focus.\nIf you want to see what's really going on, there's a profiler page you can use by going to the url: chrome-extension://<extension_id>/html/profiler.html\nAnd in addition to the pros that @arturkohut mentioned in the OP, i've removed the use of content scripts, and also converted the main script to an event page instead of a persistent background page. So there should be real gains in performance of the extension as well.. Yes. I'm looking into that - it's been a request for The Great Suspender for a while. The only API available in chrome production seems to be chrome.system.memory. Although I'm not sure this will give the information we need. Do you know much about what exactly availableCapacity is? Or whether there's another API I can use?\nI did find this which seems to suggest it's not exactly what we're after? https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463374. Unfortunately, I don't think that info.availableCapacity is a reliable measure of memory used. From my testing, it can range from 50mb to 250mb regardless of how many tabs I have open, or how much memory chrome is actually using.. @sldx If I was going to enable specific tab discarding, I would need to work out a new interface for doing so, as it is not possible to discard a tab that is currently being viewed. I could reintroduce the 'discard current tab' option in the popup menu, but it would need to select a different tab before it could discard the current one. This is not that intuitive for me, and I question how useful it is to be able to discard a specific tab. What is your use case for this feature?. OK. I have reimplemented the 'discard current tab' functionality.\nI've decided to switch to the last active tab when this happens. It seems the most naturally intuitive for me, and is the least likely tab to have already been discarded (preventing a page reload when this happens).\nNew version will be on the chrome webstore shortly.\nThanks for the feed back you guys..

If you know what you are doing you can try to open the background page of the extension, go into the developer console, click on the 'application' tab, and then go to the indexedDb section.

Here is my current policy on upgrading the extension: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/322. Could you please describe a set of exact steps to reproduce this issue? \nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by a 'minimized tab' and where you are viewing the 'window menu title'.\nAlso, can you test this on the latest version (v6.30)?\nThanks.. I managed to replicate this once, but then not again.\nI'm honestly not sure what is going on. Does it make a difference when you click on the window menu? I found that if you click on it very early, it will show the url. But then reclicking on the window menu will subsequently show the correct tab title.. Thanks a lot for the video. I've managed to recreate it again. I'm getting this error in the console of the offending page:\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getSuspendedTitle' of undefined\n    at suspended.js:4\nI think this is essentially the same issue as: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/597\nI guess that minimized chrome windows exacerbate the problem of tabs loading before the extension is ready. \nIn the upcoming release, I have actually added some fallback code that will allow the page to suspend properly even if it cannot make contact with the extension (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/591).\nThis should resolve the issue. Thanks for taking the time to help me debug this.. Im not sure there is much demand for this feature. Most people, when wanting to suspend all tabs in the current window, would not want the current tab to suspend.. The upcoming version has a new option (both as a keyboard shortcut, and a right-click menu option) called 'Force suspend all tabs in all windows'.\nThis will attempt to suspend every tab in every window in a single operation. This includes currently focussed tabs, and will also override any whitelist, form input, pinned tab etc statuses.\nThe existing 'Suspend other tabs' functionality has also been tweaked. It will now respect any whitelist, form input, pinned tab etc. statuses.\nI hope this will satisfy your requirements. For the use case where you want whitelisting etc to be respected and still close the currently focussed tab, you will need to use the 'Suspend other tabs' button on each open window, and then manually suspend the currently focussed tab afterwards.. Is this still happening on the latest release? (v6.30).\nThe upcoming release will have support for settings sync which should help.. Yes. It turns out that localstorage does not work in incognito mode (for obvious privacy reasons i suppose): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API#localStorage\nThe new settings synching feature in the upcoming release will allow you to get around this.. I'm not sure I fully understand. Incognito is a whole other window. You can not have incognito tabs mixed up with normal tabs.\nAre you wanting it so that tabs in your incognito window never get suspended? This should be fairly easy. Just don't allow the extension to run in incognito mode (you can set this from the chrome://extensions url). \nOr am I missing something?. @DanH42 hmm.. maybe chrome.storage.local is shared across normal and incognito mode.\ni'm using window.localStorage and it does not.\nI'll do some more investigation.. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/28. I think this is a great idea.

Yes. It does not seem like an extension issue. Suspending and unsuspending is pretty much the same as closing the tab then reopening it.. There are already options for 'never suspend this site', and 'dont suspend for now'.\nThe first will add the root domain to the whitelist. The second will pause suspension of that specific tab until the page is either refreshed or the browser restarted.\nIf you specifically want an shortcut to whitelist a specific url instead of the domain, then refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/321. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/366\nAre you still having this issue on the latest version? (v6.30). Could you please let me know if you are still encountering this issue on the latest release (v6.30)?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/325. 1) There have been two pull requests to try to implement this. I am still reluctant to add it as a feature. A discussion on this can be found here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/281\n2) If you're having issues with the 'do not suspend tabs receiving form input' feature, can you please open it as a separate issue and give specific examples of how to reproduce.\n3) There is an open github issue for something like this: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/544 however I would need more details on the use case you are trying to handle, and a possible solution to the problem.\n4) The audio option is live in the latest webstore release (v6.30 :). Alternatively, if you do not wish to permanently whitelist the site, you can select \"Dont suspend for now\". If the tab is not suspending, i'm not sure how it can be interfering with your upload. Why do you think it is the extension that is causing you problems?. This is a bug. Due to the way that tabs are suspended, it is impossible to display the correct icon and title instantly, however, as soon as the page loads, the icon and text should be replaced. In normal circumstances this is almost instantaneous.\n@nomennescio @PlayerPL @bja-au Are any of you able to check out the chrome developer console on one of the suspended pages that is not updating the icon?\nI suspect there will be some errors in the console of these pages. It would be really useful to know what is happening here.. Even though I cannot reproduce, I will assume that this issue will be made redundant by the upcoming release v7.x. @liv-in-sky can you please walk me through your situation in a bit more depth?\nbeginning at the night before, you have chrome canary open with some tabs:\n- how many tabs? in how many windows? how many of those are suspended?\n- do you close chrome canary? or power down your computer? or simply close the lid?\nthen in the morning:\n- are you restarting/opening the lid of your computer and canary reappears? or are you manually restarting canary and it is 'continuing where you left off'?\ni assume this is the point where you're finding that some tabs do not recover their favicons:\n- how are you restarting canary at this point that fixes the issue?\nThanks for the details, it will greatly help me diagnose your issue.. hmmm.. i think for simplicity's sake, we can just ignore your normal chrome application. the two shouldn't have any effect on each other.\nso you have canary open with 3 windows containing about 53 tabs. \nthen you close canary with the chrome->exit option. \nthen you restart canary and it doesn't restore all your icons. \nthen you close canary again (with the chrome->exit option?)\nthen you restart canary again and all your icons appear ok.\nis that a good summary?\ncan i assume that before closing canary the first time you have some suspended tabs.\nand then when you restart, those suspended tabs don't show the proper icons.\nand finally on the next restart, you still have those suspended tabs but they show the correct icons?\n. @liv-in-sky when you click on a tab with a missing icon, does the icon fix itself?. I have been able to recreate this consistently on the new version by closing a window containing suspended tabs, and then using the 'reopen closed tab' option, which will restore the whole closed window. When this happens, some of the suspended tabs will not reload the correct favicons and titles.\nI have made a fix for this in the master branch (68f42da). @liv-in-sky you will be updated automatically, although that might be a week away.. I have made another optimistic fix for this issue (v7.0.133). And here is a nice video demonstrating the issue. Care of @CollinChaffin over in issue #784.\nThanks Collin :)\n\n. @mkz7 I looked into Tabli. The issue is to do with how their extension is obtaining the favicon to display in their list. If they were to query the chrome tabs api, they would be able to get the correct favicon, but they don't do this. \nJust to keep things on topic, these last few posts should probably be discussed in a new thread as they're not specifically related to this issue. \nThis issue is for the favicon and/or title of actual suspended tabs. Not for a representation of those tabs elsewhere.\nThere is a related issue for missing favicon/titles on chrome synced devices: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/46\nAnd potentially this issue for missing favicon/titles in chrome://history: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/717\n. @CollinChaffin can you try the latest commit ~~(v7.0.144)~~ (v7.0.147)?\nI have made some more changes around favicon handling and fixed at least one outstanding bug in this code.. @mkz7 Versions do update automatically, except that I'm doing a staggered rollout of newer versions so not everyone will get it at the same time.\nThat said, v7.109 IS the latest chrome webstore version. But it has known favicon issues. It also does NOT have the new \"Apply Chrome's built-in memory saving when suspending.\" option. That is still in development and will be released shortly.\nThe latest development version of the extension should also have resolved all outstanding favicon issues (v7.0.147).\nAnd awesome news from Tabli! Thanks for posting here.\n. This has been address in the upcoming release (v6.31).\nHere is the commit: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/6abe254acac346db50485a851c9fea10fff8b7e6. I would say that setting your 'Automatically suspend tabs after' option to 20 seconds should pretty much achieve this goal?. My view on this is to not go too deep into the session management side of things with this extension. It is primarily meant to be an extension for reducing chromes memory and cpu usage, not really to be used as a session management tool. The session management was really only implemented to help people recover lost tabs after an extension crash or update.\nI highly recommend using Session Buddy for all session saving requirements. @dnut The exported sessions from this extension can be restored using session buddy. Sorry, but due to the reasons stated above I don't want to implement session importing. However, having no way to export is unfair for users which is why I implemented that.. To keep this issue manageable I'm restricting it to the very first request made by @pedrosimao \n\"Being able to Save each Window independently. For example, if I have 3 Windows open in a certain session, each window containing many open (or closed) tabs. It would be great if I can save only one specific window, instead of the entire Session containing 3 Windows.\"\nFor the ability to import sessions, see https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/247\nFor the ability to sync sessions across computers, see https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/575\nAs for \"An option to name a session while saving it\". This is already the current functionality? When you click save, it prompts for a name.\n. The upcoming release will have a 1 and 2 week option :)\nJust be slightly wary of this outstanding issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/176 which is due to the computer going to sleep or hibernating.. This behaviour has nothing to do with this extension. The Great Suspender does not try to control which tabs get opened on browser start. That is purely chrome behaviour (unless you have another extension installed that might do this).. Also, this is a security feature implemented by chrome to ensure malicious extensions are not installed without the users knowledge so I am not able to control when it appears.\nThe chrome webstore does have v6.30 now though so you may be able to switch to that.\nPlease follow the correct procedure for doing so though: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526. There is a feature request for this: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/40\nFor a guide on recovering lost tabs please refer to: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526\n. Thanks. I am aware. Someone else has also reported this: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/500\nGiven this extension is open source, I'm not sure I have any rights to complain? I'm more concerned with the outrageous user numbers the extension purports to have. It doesn't seem to correlate with the number of reviews it has on the webstore :/\n. I cannot reproduce this. Is it still happening on v6.30?. Hmm. The whitelist supports regular expressions. You could possibly create a blacklist this way? The syntax is (for example): /^https:.*google.com/ \nSo to whitelist everything you could use: //\nThen add in some negations? Let me know if you find anything that works for you.. Using the ^ symbol outside of square brackets [] in a regex refers to the start of the string being tested. \nie: /^google.com/ will not match the string www.google.com\nwhereas /google.com/ will* match www.google.com as it contains a substring match.\nyou're right in that you cannot have conflicting entries in the whitelist. a site will be whitelisted if any of the entries is a match. therefore, you will have to include all your negations inside a single regex. not pretty, but possibly workable.\ntry something like this:\n^((?!foo|bar).)*$\nwhere foo and bar are strings you want to blacklist.\nthis is a regex negative lookahead. see this stack overflow for more info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/406230/regular-expression-to-match-a-line-that-doesnt-contain-a-word\noh, and there's some handy online regex sites for testing your regular expressions such as: http://regexr.com/\nbe sure to test a single url at a time (not over a line separated list of urls) as this is how the extension processes them.. Someone else raised this as an issue recently: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/435\nI tested it on v6.30 and couldn't find anything wrong.\nWhen I say I tested it, what I mean is, I added it to the whitelist, then went to a tab that should now be whitelisted, and clicked on the popup. It should show in the top bar of the popup whether the page is going to be whitelisted or not.\nAh, I think in your first case you are not using regex properly. The * modifier in regex means \"match the previous character zero or more times\". You cannot use it on it's own, you need to provide a character in front of it. ie:\n/a*/ will match '' or 'a' or 'aa' etc..\n/.*/ will match any string (including an empty string)\nFinally, you mention you tried ^((?!google).)*$ and google tabs were still suspending.\nFirstly, you need to put wrap that in slashes in the whitelist /^((?!google).)*$/ so that the whitelist knows to interpret it as a regular expression.\nSecondly, that regex is for blacklisting strings. So google should suspend, but any url without the word google in it will be whitelisted.\nI have tested this blacklisting concept and it seems to work well. Having the following in your whitelist will whitelist all sites except google and twitter:\n/^((?!google|twitter).)*$/\nThere are two caveats to this:\n1. It can be negated by other whitelist entries (having a second whitelist entry of www.google.com will then cause google to be whitelisted\n2. In the above example, any url with the word google or twitter in it will also be blacklisted. ie: https://www.reddit.com/r/google/ will be blacklisted too.. Closing as duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/145. There is a \"dont suspend for now\" option that will prevent the tab from being suspended until it is closed or chrome is restarted. That is exactly what you are after no?\nPerhaps it's a UI wording issue... I have had mixed success in directly trying to validate memory savings. However, anecdotally the extension definitely does work. I realize that's not much comfort. \nI have attempted in the past to track the memory savings directly, but it is difficult to directly track the memory change from one process disappearing (the suspended tab - if it was the last tab with in that domain) and another increasing in memory slighly (the extension process).\nAlso, I don't know what other things are going on in the chrome internals.\nFinally, there is the CPU factor. Suspended tabs have all their javascript removed (well actually replaced with some very small script from the suspended tab). So there should be a gain in processing as well.. Merging this issue into: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/613. Have merged the #431 implementation instead.. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/448\nSee that issue for my comments on this.. I cannot replicate this. Manually suspending a tab (in v6.30) does not cause it to automatically reload after being suspended.\nAlso, the functionality to have a delay is already implemented. If you ctrl+tab through suspended tabs fast enough, they do not automatically reload.. @jeffmahoney  I'm slightly reluctant to add this feature. I prefer to keep the interface as simple as possible, and I'm not sure this is a feature that the majority of users would want.\nI'm also afraid of anyone accidentally clicking this and then losing all their tabs.\nI would much prefer this functionality to be more 'hidden' inside the session management tab. Perhaps as a button under the 'current session' section?\nWhat do you think?. Unsuspending a tab is basically just reloading it. As with any tab, if you reload it, you tend to lose any form input (unless the website supports quick saving). \nThe extension is not designed to save form input, and it would raise security concerns if it did try to do so.\nThere is the option: \"Do not suspend tabs that contain unsaved form inputs\". This is designed to detect when you have started entering information into a form, and prevent the page from suspending automatically if it detects form input.\n@BobAalsma What is the url of the tab that is causing you problems? Do you have the above option enabled? And is the tab suspending automatically?. Well an easy workaround is to whitelist that page. That will prevent it from auto suspending. The form input detection is not perfect, but without an actual webpage to test on, it's hard to know what might be going on.. If you want to use special characters like the * wildcard in the whitelist, you need to use the alternative regular expression syntax which looks something like this:\n/^https:.*google.com/\nfor your example:\n/.*blankbanshee.bandcamp.com/ \nshould work.. Haha. I think it's probably more that the 'guide' is not made obvious enough :). My first guess would be that you have the 'Screen capture' setting enabled. The link you sent is has a very large amount of content. It is most likely trying to convert that into a very large image.\nThe issue raised is valid however. The extension needs to be able to handle situtations like this in a performant way.. The latest version of the extension (v6.30 - available from github only, not on the webstore) has a slightly different approach to screen capturing. It allows to either capture 'visible screen' or 'the entire page'. This allows you to scroll the entire image (if the latter option is selected).\nHowever, both these options appear to have about the same performance in terms of image generation time, so it may not help you with your initial problem. Unfortunately I'm using an external library to do the image generation so it's performance is out of my control.\nThe page you linked suspends for me in about 7 seconds. Perhaps you're using a much less powerful computer than me? What version of the extension are you using?. Wow. That's crazy. Unfortunately I'm having trouble recreating your issue. Can you give me more information about your system? What OS and version? What version of chrome? How much ram does your computer have? Is there anything else on your computer which might be impacting performance? How many chrome tabs and windows do you have open?. Thanks a lot for working this out @Pascal666 \nAFAIK most tab screenshot extensions use the native screen capture API provided by google. However, this API will only allow you to capture a 'visible' tab. I need to be able to capture tabs that are about to be suspended which are almost never visible.\nThe Html2Canvas library I use is the only library I've found that achieves this: https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas\nPerhaps someone has already reported this issue to him. Actually, I am not using the latest version of the library either. I briefly tested the newer version and it seemed to be significantly slower so I decided to stick with the existing version. Perhaps this newer version solves your zooming issue. I'll try to do some further tests soon.. @Pascal666 I have been through the 4 alternatives to html2canvas you posted. Unfortunately none of them are as reliable as the current solution. dom-to-image seemed the most promising, and indeed manages to capture zoomed pages without problem. but it has other issues - like it fails to capture youtube properly where html2canvas succeeds.\nAs a work-around for the original issue (excessive CPU usage on zoomed tabs), i have added a new preference 'Enable screen capture on zoomed tabs' which is disabled by default. This is primarily to prevent large CPU usage for those users who are unaware of the issue. As a result they will not get screen captures on tabs that are not at default zoom. This is, i believe, in preference to their CPU maxing out at 100% for minutes on end just to suspend a tab.\nKeen to hear your feedback.. I have had issues with the latest version of Html2Canvas. See the comments in this PR for more info: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/562\nThe new release uses a patched version of an older version of Html2Canvas. This seemed to be the best compromise between performance and compatibility.. It turns out the patched version was super slow. It looks like the most recent alpha is actually really good though so i'm going with that now.. Also, I checked the screen capturing on zoomed tabs with the new version of html2canvas and it seems to have no issues anymore. So I have removed all special handling around zoomed tabs and treat the just the same as ordinary tabs.. Unfortunately, the chrome webstore manages my private key and i cannot access it :(\n. Any update on this? From what you've given me I can't really help you. \nCan you provide steps to reliably reproduce the issue?. Implemented in commit: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/e3168d2d2dadb4f7e8cc89dfea57cce28e95cc2c. Thanks for the update @sheershoff . Let me know if you encounter problems in the future. . Merging this issue into: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/613. Im not sure what is going on. panic stations! i have lost control of the extension from the chrome developer dashboard. v6.22 does not even exist. i had no hand in this getting forced upon users.\ni will update here when i know more :(. I'm in contact with Google and they're helping me resolve the issue. Fingers crossed I'll have it back soon.\nI've checked the code of the new version that has been pushed to the webstore. There is nothing malicious in it, just a version number change. I think the huge storm of activity is due to everybody suddenly being forced to update. It's something I had deliberately avoided doing for exactly this reason. It's a real shame, and the blame ultimately falls on me for allowing my developer account to be compromised.\nHuge apologies to everyone affected by this. I'll try to work out the best way to get the message out to the non-github community.. @lgpmichael2 the only way you can convince yourself 100% is to check the source code for the v6.22 on your computer. this has been done by others above and they corroborate what I have stated.. @crsmoore the extension is now completely back under my control. i have a new version pending review. i would actually reenable v6.22. and then when the new version comes out, it will automatically update.\n@lborgman there is no trace left behind of the intruder in any of the code, including the v6.22 in question. and the new release that is pending review is built 100% from this gitHub source, so won't require any investigating.. v6.30 is official. It's a new release I put in place to replace the compromised v6.22.. @ahtneio did you manage to recover your tabs? hopefully now that it's live again in the webstore you can reinstall and your data will be there? sorry, i'm not sure if the indexeddb data persists over an uninstall/reinstall.\n@mpe i have also been trying to access the indexeddb files directly, but with no luck. there's a promising stack overflow question on it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35074659/access-google-chromes-indexeddb-leveldb-outside-of-chrome. @bryannaegele i will work on a formal post-mortem as soon as i have a chance.\n@Ihysoal strange as it sounds, this is actually my best guess for what happened. i'll elaborate more in the post-mortem but the attacker did not actually do anything malicious at all (google account hacking aside).. @crafty-geek unfortunately #322 is here to stay. which probably means that v6.30 is also here to stay. the way the extension works, tabs are tied to the extension process. i have experimented with multiple ways around this, but have not come up with anything workable.\nNot quite true actually. The solution is in The Great Discarder (my sister extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-discarder/jlipbpadkjcklpeiajndiijbeieicbdh?hl=en)\nThis uses native chrome tab discarding instead of relocating the tab url. It has a much lighter footprint as it doesn't require content scripts or a persistent background process. It also requires much lighter permissions. And it is fully compatible with chrome tab syncing across devices. And most importantly, it doesn't lose your tabs when the extension updates! \nThe tradeoff is that it has much less functionality. It cannot detect if a tab contains unsaved form inputs, it cannot save a placeholder screenshot, and most annoyingly, if you return to the tab (even if you are just 'tabbing through' a discarded tab) it will reload.. @uecasm it's a 'feature' of how google handles extension updates. there is no way to know if an update is coming, and there is no way for a user to manage that update manually. the situtation today (of multiple updates) was a rare case caused first by an unsolicited update, secondly by chrome removing the extension from the webstore, and then thirdly, from the legitimate version being installed when the extension appeared back on the webstore.\nThis is precisely why i had disabled automatic updates (from my end). The end user has no control over this (unless you install the extension manually from the source here on gitHub).\nThe reason the extension bundles session management is for this exact problem of tabs disappearing on update. In order for me to recover the lost tabs after an update, i need to keep track of the tabs currently open. . @Master-1- The compromised extension did not contain any malicious code (thankfully!). I ran checks over the unsolicited release and there was no actual code changes in there. So there is no chance that this event is related to any hacking attempt you might have seen. I'm still unsure as to exactly what the intentions were of the attackers. Perhaps ownership was restored to me before they had a chance to implement whatever they had planned.\n@faultylee Any update will cause loss of tabs, so it's impossible to pre-warn. And I feel like such a message would just cause general confusion anyway. I still believe that the best way to handle this going forward is to simple NEVER UPDATE the extension automatically. As long as the code is relatively bug-free then this is the best course of action for the sanity of the users. \n. @RJVB \n\nBut isn't there a way around this all? As a user I can tell the extension to unsuspend all tabs, what if you make it do that before updating, so that those tabs are no longer owned by the extension? I don't know if you can detect \"I'm going to be updated\" events, or even \"I'm going to quit\" but it seems the extensions API must provide something of the sort to allow extensions to clean up after them when the user disables or removes them.\n\nThis is exactly the issue. The API does not provide any ability to detect \"Im going to be updated\" or \"Im going to quit\". There is only a \"Im going to be uninstalled\" which does not help. Therefore, once again I reiterate, the only person who knows when an update is coming is me, based on when I push a new version. Even then, I cannot control when this version will be updated on a clients browser. \nI could post a warning, but then how long do I wait before pushing the update? Waiting less than a day, I risk most users not getting a chance to read the warning. Waiting more than a day, I risk users forgetting about it, creating many more tabs, and then getting caught offguard when the update does happen. I'm not saying warning users is a bad idea, just that it is far from an elegant solution to the problem.\nMy ongoing policy with updates has always been to warn users first. However, my ongoing policy has also been never to push an update, so I've never actually had to exercise this warning.. @faultylee\nThe reason tabs are lost has nothing to do with elevated permissions. It is purely a consequence of the extension having to restart to perform any sort of update. As soon as an update is forced by chrome, the extension is forced to close (without warning). This causes all suspended tabs to disappear.\nI have integrated some session management code which should detect this situation after the update and automatically restore these lost tabs. However, the code is not fool proof and does not work 100% of the time. And it assumes the extension remains enabled - which was not the case for a period of time during the incident recently.. @crafty-geek This has been suggested before. The idea of the Great Suspender beta which is subject to updates at the users risk.\nThere's nothing stopping me doing it. I don't really like the added confusion that would create on the webstore, but I might consider it if there is enough demand. You can always install the latest code from the gitHub project page so that is essentially the work-around.. @h3298 I am currently working on a post mortem of the hack and will post it as a medium article shortly.. Closing this issue as it doesn't reflect the issue title and is a bit messy. Consider this the official thread for 'fallout from the extension being compromised'\nFor issues related to lost tabs caused by the extension updating, please refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526. @x1ddos that's because i'm not on medium (yet) :) \nWill post here once it's done, although I haven't started yet. I wanted to get the guide for recovering lost tabs done first (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526). And please see this thread for an explanation of why the extension requests these permissions: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/213. I have considered this, and as a result I created another extension called The Great Discarder. It is significantly better than The Great Suspender in terms of memory use and required permissions, but lacks the features that these permissions enable.\nIt's probably exactly what you're after. Check it out:\nChrome webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-discarder/jlipbpadkjcklpeiajndiijbeieicbdh?hl=en\nGitHub: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatdiscarder. Please refer to this guide on why this happens and how to recover lost tabs: #526. @greenitthe do you have any idea which version of the extension you had before the update? did the UI look entirely different?\nThis is a pretty serious issue. I'd like to find out more, but it's pretty hard to test. I wonder if anyone else has encountered this issue?\nPerhaps you would like to make a comment on this guide i made for recovering from tab loss. I will be redirecting all users suffering from lost tabs there, and they might be able to report the same issue as you.. @bend1234 in your session buddy backup, can you post one of the urls of a tab that is failing? and also, on a failed tab, can you open the developer console and see if there are any errors in the console?. Ok. I can see from that url what the issue is. That url is from a very old version of the extension. I though that the new release would handle these old urls properly, but it appears not :(\nSomeone once made a bookmarklet to help manually unsuspend bad urls. I have tested it and it appears to still work on the above urls. \nHere are the original instructions to save and use the bookmarklet (thanks @joeytwiddle):\n\n\nHit Ctrl-Shift-B to show your Bookmarks Toolbar.\nRight click to create a new \"page\" there, call it Unsuspend and give it the following URL:\n\njavascript:document.location=decodeURIComponent(document.location.hash.replace(/.*url=([^&]*).*/,'$1'));(void 0);\n3. The next time you are on a suspended page, tap your bookmarklet and it will unsuspend.  :)\n\n\nThis is a workaround for now. I'll try to add a fix so that future versions will handle these old urls appropriately.. @Colt15 Uninstalling will remove all your tabs. Back them up with the session buddy extension first!\nNot sure if reinstalling will help as I haven't made a fix for this issue yet. \nCan you please copy and paste one of the problem urls here so I can see what's going on? \nSent from my LGE Nexus 5X using FastHub. @Colt15 that really seems like a different issue to the others. Those urls look fine to me. Uninstalling and reinstalling really might help you. But you'd have to backup your suspended tabs with session buddy first and then restore the session afterwards with session buddy. \nSorry but I can't understand what might be happening for you. You could always try looking in the dev console for errors on one of the broken pages?. Javascript is most definitely required for the extension to function at all. Suspended tabs will simply not display without it. I do not recommend turning off javascript if you intend to also use this extension.\nHowever, reenabling javascript should cause everything to return to normal.. It has been renamed to 'suspend other tabs'. It functions the same, except that it won't suspend the currently active tab (not sure if it ever did actually),. I have updated the issue title to be more specific as it looks like clicking on a suspended tab does automatically unsuspend it. It is only failing when a tab is closed and a suspended tab is shown in its place.\n. lol. i just came across this other issue which tidying up: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/114\nit requests that suspended tabs that gain focus after anther tab is closed should not automatically unsuspend. i agreed with the user at the time, hence the change in functionality.\nit's not a bug, it's a feature!\ni guess the long-term solution is to have this as a configurable option.. After some deliberation, I have decided to revert this functionality back to how it used to be. Any suspended tab that gains focus will now automatically reload, regardless of whether the focus was gained via the closing of another tab.\nThe main reason for this decision was consistency. It appeared to be too much like a bug the way it currently operated. And I'm not sure the number of people in favour or against this feature is significant either way.. @draarong @mcmasjc3 @smilejack1 \nreally? it seems to work for me?\njust to confirm:\n- you have 'Automatically unsuspend tab when it is viewed' checked. \n- you visit a suspended tab by clicking on it.\n- it automatically unsuspends.\n- you close that tab and chrome brings another suspended tab in focus.\n- this tab does not automatically unsuspend?\nthis is working fine for me on v7.0.90. ie: it does automatically unsuspend the tab in the last step.\ncan each of you please go through the above steps and confirm that this does not work? and also record the version of the extension you are using?\nthanks!\n. @t0m05 i have created a new issue requesting the ability to make this a configurable behaviour: #747. @mcmasjc3 Can you please check a few things for me?\n1. Tell me the version of TGS you are using\n2. Ensure 'Automatically unsuspend tab when it is viewed' is checked\n3. Open a new chrome window and navigate to a website and then suspend that tab while looking at it\n4. Create a new tab in that same window (so you have just 2 tabs in that window) and then close it again immediately.\n5. Confirm that the suspended tab unsuspends automatically (or not :/ )\nThanks :).

Are you aware that reloading the page will also unsuspend it? ie: command+r in osx or F5? in windows.\nPerhaps this is a fair compromise? I could add spacebar support back in, but not sure if it would really be useful to that many people - especially as it is rather undocumented..

New users always get the latest version of your app.\"\nI think this also means that existing users are literally unable to receive updates. This is why I suggest uninstalling and reinstalling as the only way around this.. @uecasm I can't believe I have never noticed this event. It's probably exactly what I need. I'll try it out. Thanks for the heads up! Unfortunately, it's going to take another update to get it implemented :(. @mengsel In the session management page, there is a link to export each session. This produces a text file with each (unsuspended) url on a new line.\nThe Great Suspender has no way to import these sessions on another computer, but you can do exactly that with Session Buddy, another chrome extension which I mention in the information above.. @rudolphos what exactly are you trying to do? if you want to export a list of urls in all your tabs, you can do exactly that from the session management screen within the extension (as mentioned in my reply to @mengsel above). @owenblacker if you open the chrome developer console on the session management screen, are there any errors on the page?\nThis other person might be having the same issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/464\nWould be good to find out more info on this!. @adcurtin yes. that is expected. re-enabling it should restore all your tabs automatically?\nif you want that setup, then you're best to just set the v6.30 on your main computer to 'time to suspend -> never' which will essentially disable it just on that computer.. @dragonspirit1185 i'm not sure what you are referring to when you say \"if this wasn't fixed?\". you mean potential tab loss when updating? is that the \"even bigger issue\" you refer to? just to be clear, this is not an issue that has been created in the most recent release. it has been an ongoing issue every time i push an update to the chrome webstore. i'm also not sure what you mean by the \"tab limit\". can you clarify?\ndue to the way the extension works, there is absolutely nothing i can do about suspended tabs disappearing during an update. the code that restores tabs after the update seems to work well for almost everybody, but there seems to be always a small percentage of people for whom it fails.\nin regards to your usage of the session manager. perhaps you haven't realised, but you can actually just reopen a single window from a session instead of the whole session. you need to expand the session containing the window you want to restore, then next to the 'window 1' (or whatever number), click the 'resuspend' button. you could alternatively click the 'reload' button, but this will cause every tab in the window to load from the original website. from the sounds of it, that's what you've been doing. because if you choose 'resuspend' instead, it can actually open a window with quite a large number of tabs pretty quickly.\ni'm sorry that i've caused a loss of tabs for you. i do understand how frustrating that can be. as you know, the impetus for this release was to fix the youtube cookies bug. and i made a call that it was more important to fix that at the cost of a few users suffering from a loss of tabs. \nrest assured i'm doing everything i can to get to the root cause of these issues. unfortunately i don't have the resources to outsource any of this. but as @liamjohnston said, you're welcome to contribute if you're able.. @sclient for the youtube button issue, it sounds like it might be the same as this person: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/713\ni have not been able to replicate this, and can't see how this extension could break another website. but keen to investigate more. does refreshing the youtube page help? what happens if you disable the extension and then refresh again? (after unsuspending all your tabs first of course).\nare you familiar with the chrome developer tools console? if so, can you tell me if there are any errors in the console?. @nmhung1985 the 'before update' warning will only on a subsequent update (ie. not on this current update). are you asking if i will be incorporating features from the great discarder into this extension? or the other way around (incorporating new features from this upcoming release into the great discarder)?\nThe great discarder has diverged pretty significantly from this extension in terms of code, and most new features from this extension are not relevant to the great discarder. however, i do plan on doing some work on the other extension once this one is out the door.. @nmhung1985 i'm in the middle of a selective rollout. if you wait a few more days the webstore version will update automatically. if you want it now, then uninstalling and reinstalling is the way to go. Just make sure you unsuspend or backup all your tabs first :). @Boscop If you just wait, you will at some point be automatically updated to the latest version without any warning (assuming you are still on v6.30).\nWhen this happens, any tabs you had suspended will disappear, leaving only those tabs that were unsuspended still showing in your browser.\nAfter the update, the extension will attempt to recreate those suspended tabs that disappeared.\nIn most cases, this process works flawlessly. However, there always seems to be a few users for whom this process fails.\nThe best thing you can do to protect yourself is install another extension which keeps a running backup of the tabs you have open.\nSee this issue thread for recommendations: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/742\nThat way, if you do suffer from a loss of tabs, you can easily recover them from an automatic backup.. @Boscop i'm using \"Tabs Backup & Restore\" and it's working fine for me. It may not be maintained, but i assume it will continue to work fine unless Google updates chrome in such a way as to break existing extension API functionality.. @ctsstc A new version is coming very soon and it will update everybody. The current version on the chrome webstore has some known issues so I've halted the rollout.. @a5m0 what do you see within the session management section of the great suspender? it should have saved a session with all your open tabs pre-update.\nsorry about session buddy. it seems that they stopped doing automatic session saves quite a while ago. there's a thread about better alternatives: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/742. It sounds like linux could be a common thread here? I'll do some investigation. \nAnd very sorry for all of you who are suffering from lost tabs :(. @RezaRob I agree. But you do find small differences between the chromium implementations on different operating systems. It's probably grasping at straws though.\n@dskrepps Would you mind doing a little bit of debugging for me? That is probably the fastest way to get to the bottom of this. The wiki has instructions on how to enable the debugging log: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/wiki/How-to-enable-the-debugging-log\nOnce that's turned on, you just need to open and close a tab or two. Normally this would cause the current session to get saved. I suspect that is generating an error which will hopefully be logged to the console.\n. Unfortunately it seems that my implementation of \"Open link in suspended tab\" does not obey the \"Add The Great Suspender to right-click context menu\" checkbox.\nAlso, I'm finding weird behaviour on right click of links. Sometimes it gives me an entire menu of choices, and other times just the single \"Open link in suspended tab\" option.. @rxbasu Is it possible you've just hidden one installation from the menu bar?\nif you go to chrome://extensions can you see a version of TGS there?. @rxbasu that's super weird. sorry but i'm not sure i'll be able to help you much with this. it seems like some kind of chrome bug. \nyou can try deleting the extension files manually from your filesystem.\nif you open up the settings page for the extension, it should show you the extension id in the url. if you do a search for this id on your filesystem you should be able to find out where the extension files are being stored on your computer.. I personally checked the code of the 'hacked' version and there was no alteration to the behaviour of the extension in any way. It really sounds like you've got some malware on your computer from somewhere... Both those urls seem to work for me. \n\nIs it possible that it would be fixed with a chrome restart?\nActually, before you do that, it would be really useful to see what is in the developer console of the suspended tab that does not have a title... @nompen you closed this issue? did it resolve itself? i was going to suggest doing a ctrl + f5 (hard refresh) on the pages that aren't working. as from the screenshots, i can't see why these pages would fails but others wouldn't.. @nompen i'm really sorry but i can't see how it's possible that the suspended.js script is failing on one tab, and not on another one.\nthe line in question is: chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage().gsUtils\nwhich means on the tabs that are failing, the call to chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage() is not working properly.\nhave you done a browser or computer restart since the upgrade.\nit's possible that the issue has something to do with ubuntu, that's the only thing i'm unable to test from my end.. Similar to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/554\nFor performance (memory) reasons, I have a limit to the length that an screen capture image can be.. Actually, this limit has a practical side too. An image greater than a certain size cannot be converted to a dataUrl which is what i use to store the captured screenshot on disc.. Im unable to replicate this. Here is my version:\n\nCan you confirm you are on v6.30?\nAnd also, if you are having problems with the extension stopping responding, my first guess would be that it is related to the capturing of screenshots when a tab suspends?. @ohsix finally got some time to look into this.\nit turns out that this is just a failure of the chrome->application devtools tab to automatically refresh. if you close the background page and reopen it, you'll see there's only 1 instance of the icon19.png file.\nthe reason that these files stack up is because i update the popup extension icon depending on the currently viewed tabs status (it will go grey if the tab will not automatically suspend and turn yellow again when it will be automatically suspended). every time I call browserAction.setIcon() to update the icon, it adds a new resource to the 'Images' section pictured above. I assume the old resources get removed at some point, but the application UI does not automatically update to reflect this.. Unfortunately I cannot do anything from my end to keep the original urls. They are already being recorded in the url via the &uri=xxx query parameter.\nOther extensions (such as session buddy) seem to have built in support for The Great Suspender. OneTab would need to do the same.\nThis is slightly related to the syncing issue where urls are not accessible via synced devices: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/46\nPerhaps if I ever manage to resolve that issue, then the onetab support will happen naturally.. Hi. Sorry for the delay on this. I can confirm that it is indeed an issue caused by how the scroll position is recorded in the cookie (exactly as @mike-athene described).\nThe cookie will get cleared on a browser restart, unless you have the 'continue where i left off' setting checked in chrome.\nThe workaround for now (in the case of youtube) is to go to chrome://settings/content/cookies and type www.youtube.com in the 'search cookies' box, and then click on the trashcan to delete.\nIt would be nice to get some idea of how badly this is affecting average users. Are their any other sites that have similar issues?\nI will work on a fix asap. I'm not sure just yet when that will find it's way into the chrome webstore. That depends on a few other changes that will be bundled into the same release.. The fix is tied up in a dev branch along with a lot of other new code. I'm tying it all up now and want to give the whole release a thorough test before putting in on the chrome webstore. I'm really sorry for the delay everyone.. \ud83d\ude1e \nthat is not actually the whole story however. \nyou may or may not be aware of the current extraordinarily painful process receiving an automatic update of this extension can be: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526\nwell the good news is that there was an obvious way to solve this the whole time, but it is going to take 2 new releases before it takes effect (ie. it only kicks in once you have the next new version already installed, and are about to receive the subsequent new version).\nso i have been very reluctant to push ANY new version that did not have this new update handling feature. unfortunately, and there is no apologising for this, a lot of other new features ended up creeping into this release at the same time.\n@afedulov a temporary hotfix on master IS an option, but i would not want to force the update on anyone automatically. so it would require manual installation. AFAIAA, the only way to update to said version would be to uninstall the extension and reinstall it. this means losing your settings, whitelist, and session history. and the only people that would be doing this are the few of you on this thread.\nit's probably not a crazy amount of work to do, so if you really insist i'll do my best. \nand once again, big apologies for not handling this in the best manner. semantic version control wasn't even part of my vocabulary when i started this extension - which explains why it's v6.30 :(\n. @volt55 \nThe workaround for now (in the case of youtube) is to go to chrome://settings/content/cookies and type www.youtube.com in the 'search cookies' box, and then click on the trashcan to delete.\nyou will not need to restart the browser for this to work.\nalternatively, a browser restart will also fix it (without having to manually delete the cookies). @pirate the new release will not involve cookies at all. it should never have been coded with cookies. i must have been eating magic cookies at the time :/\nthe issue really is just getting this new release out onto the web store. i'm trying my best, but don't want to push to all users until it has been thoroughly tested (due to upgrading pain points).\nthere's not a day i don't think about this issue thread and resolving this. it is just that i have very limited time available.. @joekohlsdorf by 'dev' i mean 'master' :(\nthe latest tagged alpha release will have what you're after and should be 'reasonably' stable.. That this issue is still unresolved on the webstore fills me with shame :(\nIt is now my highest life priority to resolve this asap (barring any unforeseen family emergencies).\nMy main reservation at this point is a lack of testing on the current dev version (if only i had unit tests).\nI will give an update on this thread at the end of the week with a progress report.\nSorry once again everybody.. There is a new beta release available: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.0-beta.94\nI will spend the next few days testing this.. All suspended tabs should be automatically recovered after the update. However, in practice I've found that there's always a few people for whom this process fails.\n@kabalage: After the update, the extension should have saved a session of the tab state before the update. And there is some instructions directing the user to the session management page if they had any trouble with lost tabs. \nThere seems to be one other case where people also have all their saved and current sessions disappear. If this happens there's really nothing I can do. It would be a matter of going through your chrome history and trying to recover from there.\nOf course, if you want to be safe, you can always install a session manager like session buddy. This should protect you from any tab loss as long as you use it to back up your tab sessions.. New beta release is out: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.0-beta.103\nAlmost finished my testing script. Not expecting to find any more bugs at this point. \nIf all goes to plan then I'll release to a small portion of users tomorrow night \ud83d\ude2c \nThere's a few outstanding github issues which worry me. But i've been unable to reproduce them so I'm hoping that they're not going to affect many people.\nFeedback on these issues is welcome:\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/706\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/646\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/659\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/464\n. Thanks for the feedback. I have rolled out to 5% of existing users. I will investigate a few possible issues and then continue the rollout to the rest.\nThere is a change that those of you who already have the update may receive another one very shortly. Apologies for this in advance. \nThe good news is the new version you now have has the ability to warn you before updating :D. @AlexWayfer thanks. i suspect i know why that might be. i've created an issue to handle this: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/726. For all those still waiting on a fix for this on the chrome webstore, I have rolled out the new release to a select group of users.\nThe feedback has been pretty good in general, but there's still some issues that i'm investigating which could be worth fixing before continuing the rollout to the rest of you.\nIf you want to get the current version from the webstore (v7.0.109) then you can force it to update by uninstalling and reinstalling the extension.\nREMEMBER, make sure you unsuspend or backup all tabs before this! A session backup utility that saves suspended urls will be fine. And restoring a session of suspended urls will be significantly faster than unsuspending them all.\nJust bear in mind if updating, that there will probably be a subsequent update forced out to you in the near future with a few (non-critical) bug fixes.. @Boscop please refer to this thread for information on recommended session backup extensions: #742\nAlthough if you want a tldr; \n- If you want a good well maintained extension for manually making session backups, use Session Buddy. Just make sure you make a backup just before switching TGS from webstore version -> github version.\n- If you want a non-maintained but still working extension for automatically making session backups, use Tabs Backup and Restore (your webstore link is the correct one). \nNeither of these extensions is going to be able to backup your tabs in an unsuspended state. However, as long as you have at least one version of TGS installed, then after reloading a saved session with suspended tabs, using the 'unsuspend all' button in TGS should reload all the suspended tabs, regardless of which version of TGS they were suspended from.\nOne final note. If you do want an export of all the original urls, you can the the 'Session management' feature of The Great Suspender to do this. It will export original urls only - not suspended ones. These exports should be compatible for import into other session managers as it exports simply as one url per line with windows separated by an extra newline.. @DFNCTSC actually, the simpler fix is just to not use cookies at all to store this information.\nThere's a couple of reasons i can give you for the delay. I'm not saying I made the right choices, and it's up to you whether they make sense or not.\nFirstly, updating this extension is hell for the users. See #526 for an illustration of this. This means that i try to keep updates down to a minimum (zero ideally). So I do not take updates lightly, and while coding the fix is trivial, releasing it is not.\nHaving this in mind, when I went to produce a 'fixed' version, I wanted to also fix as many other things as i could at the same time, to keep the updates required down to just 1 for the majority of users.\nThe reality is that there was some scope creep, and bugfixing turned into refactoring, and some extra features being added which produced additional bugs. \nAdd to that, that this is mostly a one-man project and I have a full time job and kids. And voila, here we are one year later.\nAs I've mentioned before, this issue has weighed on me pretty heavily for the past year. So I'm really glad to see it finally getting across the mark. But I realise 1 year is a pretty ridiculous amount of time to have taken.\n. @bro3234 @kalyanac just a heads up with session buddy. for me it fails to backup automatically. it seems to only backup when chrome is restarted, which is often quite out of date.\nsee this issue thread for more information on alternative session backup extensions: #742. @Kiina what i meant by that was that the data in the export is very basic and easily interpretable by other session managers. i do not expect them however, to automatically interpret an extra newline as a new browser window.\nyou could manually fix this by editing the session backup and putting each group of tabs into its own file, and then importing them one file at a time.\neither that, or reimport the file with the great suspender. it will interpret the file correctly.. @ibash @edsilmon There have been some other breaking changes since this issue first appears, due to changes in chrome. Most notably, around the favicons not updating and every tab having the default extension icon as it's favicon.\nThe codebase has been quite significantly rewritten since then, which has introduced it's own host of new bugs. These have mostly been resolved now and I'm currently trying to get this new release out once and for all.. There is now a milestone for the upcoming release that contains a fix for this youtube issue (and many others): https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/milestone/1\n@G-Rath thanks :)\n. Unfortunately, there is no reliable way to detect when chrome closes. The options that do exist, do not allow time for an extension to do any async action (such as suspending or unsuspending tabs).\nHere is the relevant chrome bug report: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30885. Duplicate of #700. @adcurtin Can you confirm this is still happening on the latest version? (v6.30).\nI am unable to recreate it at my end. If i change the number of unreads in my gmail inbox and resuspend, the favicon and title both update to the new contents.. Sorry for the delayed response on this. Are you still having the issue? Are you on the latest version (v6.30)? And finally, does it happen after a chrome restart?\nOh, and is there any chance you have two versions of the extension installed?\nOnce I have this information, I might be able to do some more debugging.. My only fear would be that we're relying on some undocumented internal behaviour of chrome that may be subject to change in the future.\nBut then you could make that case for using chrome://favicons in general. It surely won't work if I try to port the extension to firefox..\nSweet for now though! We can worry about that later.\n. Im not sure why i ever decided to implement the scroll position using cookies :(\nStoring it in the url makes sense. I'll adjust the code i've already written to solve this issue.. Duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537. What kind of notification were you thinking of?\nYou can already tell when a tab gets suspended as the favicon becomes slightly faded out. Where you after something more obvious?. Sorry for the late reply, but are you still having this issue?\nAnd could you please let me know the version of the extension you are using, as well as your version of chrome? Thanks.\nAlso, your username looks familiar to me, have you raised other issues as well?. This is a duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/309\nPlease add your input there to help keep the feature request consolidated. . @CrazyPython I have decided to redo the dark theme based on your input and others. Because of the relatively trivial amount of code required for the change, and because I have ended up going with different styling to your suggestions here, I will not merge this pull request.\nThanks for the input though, and a new dark theme will be out soon. Here's a preview (note, there are a few other UI changes present in this screenshot from the upcoming release):\n\n. @CrazyPython not especially. either way, it's a question for the suspended tab page in general - not just the dark theme right?\nI've updated the screenshot above to make it of a similar scale to the one you initially posted. . It is possible. Tbh i'm not that familiar with the internals of chrome's memory management. And perhaps the there is also some peculiarities in how the task manager reports on memory usage too. I vaguely recall an article from Google that mentioned accurate memory reporting is very hard to achieve.\nThe method used to suspend tabs by this extension is simply the most effective method I could find (that is, to redirect the tab to an internal extension url). If you are able to find a better method, or to provide some repeatable process for a tab not being released from memory, then I can try to improve from there.. Merging this issue into: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/613. is this a duplicate of this issue? https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/519\nthe latest version fixed a 'bug' where closing a tab would automatically unsuspend the newly focused one. there are a significant number of people however, that liked this functionality.\ncan you confirm if this is the use-case you are encountering, or if it is happening on all suspended tabs (even when specifically clicked on).. I am unable to recreate this unfortunately. \nAre you able to check out the background page of the extension to see if it is producing any errors in the console? You can open the background page view from the chrome://extensions url.\nFailing that, perhaps a restart of chrome might fix the issue?. Thanks for getting back to me :). I have never come across an error like this before. Is the exact error message you're getting actually \"This extension may have been corrupted\" ?\nSome googling does not reveal much. I assume you have tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the extension (make sure you unsuspend all tabs before doing this) ?\nIs it possible your copy of the extension is somehow being modified locally?. There is another issue reporting extension corruption: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/559\nThis person has suggested that it was their anti-virus that was corrupting the extension. I guess it is incorrectly identifying the extension as being malicious and then altering the extension files.\n@jaug1337 Do you have any anti-virus installed? Could this possibly be the cause for you?. Here is the feature request for session history syncing: #575. A fixed has been committed. A webstore update should follow soon. Still not sure if it will be an automatic update of if it will require a reinstall to upgrade.\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/552. This is closely related to issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/329\nI have decided to treat this as a bug. As it seems more intuitive to me that the 'suspend other tabs' button should respect the users automatic suspend settings. In a few particular cases, not doing so has a significant negative impact, such as:\n1) Suspending a tab that is receiving form input. This could result in loss of user input content.\n2) Suspending a tab that is playing audio. This could result in music/audio stopping.\nOther use cases are less severe.. This has been implemented in commit: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/78b7fa5005db87fff2d4189d27717490fdd0fce6\nThe 'suspend other tabs' button will now respect whitelist, temporary whitelist, form input, pinned tabs, and audible preferences.\n. Yes. The package that I use to capture the screen can be quite processor intensive which to a certain extent defeats the purpose of the extension. To mitigate this, I prevent it from capturing screenshots of any pages with over 10000 elements.\nThis issue is somewhat related to: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/503\n. @Pascal666 As mentioned in #503 i have added a new preference 'Enable screen capture on zoomed tabs' which is disabled by default. This also has a hidden functionality that will override the 10000 element limit current imposed.\nBy enabling this preference, you will also be able to get image previews on tabs with large numbers of DOM elements.. @volt55 incognito mode does not have access to the settings from the extension in normal mode. in addition, it cannot save it's own settings (due to the nature of incognito).\nThe upcoming version has a settings sync feature (#262) which, when enabled, will allow incognito windows to sync the settings from the normal mode when the window is first created.. In regards to the initial issue posted here, the fix has changed recently. I no longer do any filtering on the number of DOM elements. Instead, there is a timeout of 60 seconds when trying to render a screenshot. I have changed the 'zoomed tabs' feature to 'Enable high quality screen capture mode' which does a number of things, one of which is increase the timeout to 5 minutes.\nFor tabs with a lot of elements, whether it gets rendered will now depend on whether the render can be completed within this allotted time.\n. @Pictor13 I briefly touch on this idea in this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/265\ni don't think an extension can affect chrome flags at all.\nand also, what are you wanting to achieve? part of 'suspending' a page is to remove the DOM which frees up memory. Loading a cached version of the page would not help in this regard. It would also not affect the javascript that tries to run.\nthe only real use-case i've considered for the offline-auto-reload mode is when you are indeed offline and want to access a website that has been suspended..\nperhaps if you have more to add on this, post in that other thread instead to keep this one on topic :). @aeshildr are you still having this issue? I have tried on OSX with chrome dev (Version 61.0.3159.5 (Official Build) dev (64-bit)) and it seems ok?\nThis is with v6.30 of the extension.\nPlease let me know if I need to investigate this further.. The sessions are stored in an indexedDb database. The only way to view it really is inside the chrome dev console.\nBut what version of the extension are you using? v6.30 (the current webstore version) has the option to export each session? I have attached a picture of this.\nThis will actually just export a text file with each url on a newline. You can use another extension such as session buddy to import and then reload the session.\n\n. I'm really sorry. Please see this issue for another person in the same situation: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/464. If you are having issues with lost SAVED sessions, please refer to: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/464\nIf you are having issues with no entries for CURRENT and RECENT sessions, please refer to: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/659. @imkane Are you still having issues with this? I have heard a few other people report similar issues with the 'gsUtils' error. I have not been able to determine what causes this. There is no good reason for chrome to throw this error. I can only suggest that a chrome restart will most likely fix the issue permanently.\nI'm also not sure what you mean by the extension \"broke\". I have never seen the \"repair\" option either. Are you still having this issue? And if so, are you able to post a screen shot here of what these screens look like?\nIt's possible that it is the same issue as this person was having: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/551. Thanks for the info @bramnet. Just to be clear, you're saying that your antivirus corrupted the extension. You then uninstalled and reinstalled the extension. And THEN you opened the extension settings page and it fails to save?\nAnd have you tried a chrome restart? . For corruption issues, henceforth please refer to: #551. This has been fixed elsewhere. Thanks :). Thanks for this. \nFirstly, it would be good if you could include a link to the scaling issue you refer to. Is it the one fixed in this html2canvas PR? https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/pull/1087\nUnfortunately, the more recent beta version of html2canvas which you are using (changing from 0.4.1 to 0.5.0-beta4) comes with a few other issues which make it less desirable.\nFrom my brief testing, https://github.com pages render using the wrong font, and rendering in general seems slower. I was also not able to sucessfully capture this page: https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html which seems to be more of an issue with the height cropping (a canvas that is too large subsequently fails to convert during .toDataUrl). None of these are issues in the current 0.4.1 library.\nI would love to implement this, but the above issues with the current beta release would need to be resolved first.\nOn a somewhat related note, there is also this outstanding issue with html2canvas: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/503\nWhere tabs that have been zoomed in/out take a very long time to suspend.\n. @mikeiz404 Thanks so much for your help with this. I briefly tried to build the 0.4.1 version of html2canvas locally but couldn't get it to run. your changes look great.\nFor the toDataURL issues, I have found that using png rather than webp seems to work for the material.io page. I have added a fallback when webp fails.\nThese changes also helped me catch another bug when displaying these bad data urls so thanks for that also!. @mikeiz404 Also, FYI, I ran into another issue that didn't seem to be there in the pure 0.4.1 release. I was getting \"Failed to execute 'querySelectorAll' on 'Document' error\". The issue is detailed on the html2canvas github page: https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/issues/385\nI have patched the library to fix this: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/766a78cd9fcfecb9e060d309036fc525926ea66e\nHoping there's not more new issues out there!. Im sorry but I do not agree with your conclusions. If you have the extension disabled, then it will not be actively affecting your chrome in any way. Do you think it could be possible that it is precisely BECAUSE you have disabled then extension that your chrome is suffering from performance issues?\nThe whole point of this extension after all, is to reduce the memory and cpu consumption of chrome.\nIf you really want to test your theory, then you could at least compare the disabled state of the extension to the completely removed (uninstalled) state. If you uninstall the extension, absolutely everything about the extension is removed from your chrome. This is the only valid way to perform a comparison. Reinstalling chrome itself will not provide you with a fair test.. I'm not sure of the exact difference between a disabled extension and a removed one in regards to a running chrome. Possibly there is no difference (which is what i would expect).\nHowever, if you reenable a disabled extension, it still has all of the saved extension preferences and associated data. Whereas if you remove the extension this all gets permanently deleted.\nI'm sceptical of your assumption that the extension is causing your 'chrome not responding' issues, purely because i doubt a disabled extension can have any effect on a running chrome.\nI was merely suggesting that you repeat your tests after completely uninstalling the extension just to be sure. You seem to be under the impression that the extension is causing you issues even when disabled, so I'm suggesting remove it and see if it still gives you issues.\nAFAIK it is impossible for an extension to do anything with chrome's default files. And equally impossible that it can affect your chrome after it has been uninstalled. And most probably impossible that it can affect your chrome while it is disabled.\nSorry if my initial response was vague. I hope this clears up what I was trying to say.. There is some known issues with the context menu functionality in the current webstore version of the extension: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/527\nAlthough this is not exactly the same issue as you are reporting. There should be a new test build available later this week. Would you be interested in trying it out to see if it resolves the issue?. @nekosaurus thank you for explaining that info about the incognito window. that is indeed the problem! i have fixed this and it will be released in the upcoming version.\n@MattSuda until then, you should be able to restore your context menu by unchecking (and saving) and then re-checking (and saving) the \"Add The Great Suspender to right-click context menu\" option.. @Jollfye Thanks for the info. I've made a lot of changes to how the right-click context menu is built in the upcoming version (v7.x). I'm going to just hope that this resolves all the issues as I'm unable to replicate your issue in v6.30. \nThere is a pre-release version you can use. See the \"Install as an extension from source\" section of the readme for installation instructions. Bear in mind this is an alpha release (currently) but it should be reasonably stable.. @mikeshultz Are you still having this issue? Can you send me a screenshot of a crashed tab? Is it all suspended tabs that crash or just one every now and then?. Ah ok. The tabs crash, but they do not disappear (ie. are not removed from chrome)?\nInteresting, this means that the extension itself has not crashed. I have seen this happen occasionally, but always very sporadically.. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/321. Please refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/553\nIn the upcoming release, suspend other tabs will now respect the 'dont suspend pinned tabs' preference.. That's probably outside of the scope of what this extension is trying to achieve.\nThere are already extensions that do something very similar to what you are requesting. Try onetab: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en. Will actually leave this open, just in case others think this would be worthwhile implementing. It is actually closely related to another feature request to be able to close all suspended tabs: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/281\nAnd perhaps could tie in with another view which allows users to see these closed suspended tabs.. Yeah. The uri is purposely not encoded. It's to provide a (very lo-fi) way to access a suspended tab on a synced device.\nBecause this extension does not support chrome history sync (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/46) I did the uri this way so that at the very least you could manually delete everything before the &uri= to retrieve the original website.\nIt's pretty hack I know. But not sure if the session buddy import issue is really worth worrying about? \n. I'll leave this open, as I will encode the url again once I manage to resolve iss #46 (sync chrome history across devices). These ideas already exist as issues.\nFor allowing a limited number of tabs to remain unsuspended: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/136\nFor suspending based on a memory limit: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/223. The suspend timer for each tab is reset when the page loads. So it's much more likely that the suspended tabs you encounter were never unsuspended in the first place.\n\nFirst I thought the extension wouldn't unsuspend them, but this doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nCan you please explain why this doesn't seem to be the case?\nAnd is there a reason you use 2 minutes in your example above? Or are you just using that number as a 'for instance' ?\nIt would be good if we could confirm whether these tabs unsuspend and then resuspend, or whether they just never unsuspend in the first place. If you have few enough tabs in a window so that you can see all the favicons of each tab, then it should be fairly easy to confirm whether all the tabs unsuspend correctly, as all their favicons will change from being faded-out to being full colour.\nAre you able to perform that test for me?. Any tabs that were suspended when you click 'unsuspend all tabs' should get unsuspended and have their timers reset to the full amount. Any tabs that are not yet suspended will not be affected, so if they are quite close to suspending then they will suspend more quickly than the newly unsuspended ones. \nIn writing this reply, I think I have just grasped what you are trying to request. \nAre you suggesting that those tabs not suspended should also have their timers reset back to full when you click 'unsuspend all tabs' ?. This feature is being removed in the upcoming version. It will be replaced with a new option: Instantly suspend tabs created with 'Open Link in New Tab'\nThis can be enabled globally and will cause all new tabs opened to be suspended as soon as they load.. @baz357 the new version will be out within the next two weeks (failing any catastrophe in the test build).\nI decided to change from a right-click 'open in new suspended tab' to making it a permanent option for two reasons:\n1) If the user has the right-click context menu enabled, then the 'open in new suspended tab' option becomes hard to navigate to as you need to go through the 'The Great Suspender' sub-menu to access it.\n2) Users that use (ctrl/command)+click to open links in a new tab will be able to use this feature now as it doesn't depend on a context menu mouse click.\nIt's also worth noting that in the upcoming release, I have changed the way this feature works. In the previous version, it would truly open in a new suspend tab. The problem was, that if this url had never been loaded before, the extension would have no way to know what the favicon and page title should be. This led to a rather buggy experience (as you have noted).\nThe new implementation actually loads the page first, and once it's fully loaded, it then suspends it. This gives it access to the page favicon, title, and also screen capture - however it does mean that pages will still have to load first.. I have backtracked on this. And reintroduced the right-click 'open in new suspended tab' option.\nWith two improvements to the current implementation:\n- As mentioned above, it now actually loads the page and the suspends it.\n- The rest of the right-click context menu will not appear when right clicking on a link. @baz357 It sounds like you might still be on v6.30 of the extension. That version does not have the new 'open in new suspended tab' functionality.\nThe version on the webstore right now is not the most recent version. The most recent version can only be installed by downloading the source from gitHub. See the 'Install as an extension from source' on the README page of this project for instructions on how to try this new version.\nOr alternatively, wait until the new version is released to the webstore which will be soon.\nApologies if you really are running the code from gitHub source. If so, can you please confirm the version you have running? I am unable to replicate your issue here.. This is essentially a duplicate of this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537\nThere will be a new release on the webstore soon to address this issue. Sorry for the inconvenience.. @higstar I imagine that if you cleared your cookies and then whitelisted maps, you would not encounter this problem anymore.\n@jellonek My current optimistic timeline is April. Fingers crossed.. Keep an eye on https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537 for updates.\nI'm pushing really hard for the release right now.. Even though I cannot reproduce, I will assume that this issue will be made redundant by the upcoming release v7.x. @SnIPeRSnIPeR please see #735 for any issues with 'suspend now' on the latest version. This issue was raised from an older version of the extension, hence the 'caused-by-old-version-of-extension' label.. While it would be nice, this is unlikely to happen any time soon, as I do not want to focus too much on making the extension a session management solution. There are other (better) extensions out there for doing this - surely one of which will provide the ability to sync across devices.\nThe session history within The Great Suspender was primarily implemented to help resolve issues around lost tabs due to extension crashes and automatic updates.. Another benefit of this feature would be to help with recover when the extension corrupts itself, or suffers from other bugs such as this session history issue: #659. In regards to original comment, this is by design. There is a delay so that tabs don't automatically unsuspend when you are just 'tabbing though' tabs via ctrl+tab.\nFor second comment, see: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/519. Try going into the Session management screen from the extension settings page. \nThis will show you your current session, and you can export it to a text file. This text file is the unsuspended urls.\nIs that what you're after? Saves you using this other extension altogether right?. I have added this to the suspended tab page in the upcoming release (v7.x). @izzyslair Try restoring your session buddy session, and then choose the 'unsuspend all tabs' option from the popup menu. Hopefully that will unsuspend all the tabs.\nif that fails, someone has made a bookmarklet to help in this situation: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/216\nlet me know how you get on. and sorry for the inconvenience :(. duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/419. As a work around for now, I would recommend using the Session Buddy extension. It provides better session management functionality than The Great Suspender.. A confirmation dialog has been introduced in the upcoming version.. @Walkman100 that is definitely not right. it should never really get much over 1MB. On extension startup, the db should get truncated to keep the maximum object items down.\nAre you able to get a better analysis of the contents of the db?\nIn chrome, if you inspect the background page of the extension and then go to the 'application' tab, you can browse the contents of the indexdb database.\nAlternatively, if you can get access to the console of the background page (once again, this is pretty easy in chrome), you can try the following command:\ngsUtils.getDb().then((s) => {\n  s.query(DB_KEY).all().execute().then((result) => console.log(result))\n});\ntry it with the following substituted DB_KEY values:\n'gsPreviews'\n'gsSuspendedTabInfo'\n'gsCurrentSessions'\n'gsSavedSessions'\nThat will give you all the possible contents of the indexedDb database. \nAs I mentioned, these tables should be automatically truncated on extension startup based on these max table entry values:\ngsPreviews: 200\ngsSuspendedTabInfo: 1000\ngsCurrentSessions: 5\ngsSavedSessions: no limit\nIt would be great to find out what is taking up so much space! . @velinath does a computer restart affect the size of your indexedDb files?. I dont understand. Once you click save, it should prompt you for a name. Once you've entered a name, a new entry with that name should appear under the 'saved sessions' section.\nThere should be no need to reload the page. Unless you're referring to the situation where a session of that name already exists?. @urfausto @Pascal666 could you please open chrome developer tools when on the session management page, and see if you get any console errors after clicking the save button?\nI'm assuming you are both seeing the 'Enter a name for this session' popup?\n. OK. Thanks.\nOn closer look at the code of v6.30 it looks like there's a race condition between the session saving and the page updating. You must have a faster computer than me!\nThis has been resolved in the upcoming release (v7.x). oh yeah. that would do it!\nfar out. that's a lot of tabs and windows! \nout of curiosity, why do you have so many windows? 795 tabs i can (almost) imagine. But 220 windows? Why so many? And how do you navigate between them?. Unfortunately there is no way to disable this currently. I will look at implementing this in future.. This has been fixed. But will not update until the next release.\nThe new default amount is 0.0030 BTC\nHopefully bitcoin will be a bit more stable in the future :/\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/344b343263d23766420d00238cc724cfbab23e7b. Currently no. The only option is to prevent tabs currently playing audio from suspending.\nYou can use the popup menu and select 'Dont suspend for now' to temporarily disable tab suspension after pausing the video.\nPerhaps in future I could have an option to prevent tabs from suspending that have ever played audio. But this might be getting a bit niche.. I agree with @Pascal666 . This functionality is best delivered by a separate extension as it does not apply just to suspended tabs but to all tabs suspended or not.\n. There are two separate issues here.\nThe first is docs.google.com. This should work and does for me under v6.30. What happens if you right click on the extension icon and select 'Inspect Popup' ? Do you see any red errors in the console? Perhaps a simple chrome restart will fix this issue. Or even closing the tab and reopening it?\nSecondly, the url chrome.google.com. This is a special case url that cannot be suspended. The reason for this is that this is the url that the webstore operates on, and chrome does not allow extensions to interact with these pages for security reasons. See this issue for more info: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/302\nLet me know if you're still having issues with the first case, and what errors (if any) you are seeing when you debug the popup menu.. The chrome.google.com special case is handled by checking for that exact domain.\nCan you please post a full url example of one of the docs that cant be suspended? You can change it for anonymity, but I am mainly wanting to see the protocol and domain parts of the url.\nAlso, could you try checking the actual (google docs) page that fails to suspend for errors in the console.. My best guess would be as you said, that something has changed about google docs to prevent extensions from operating.\nDo you have some kindof google drive extension or app installed?\nIt will be pretty hard to make progress on this as I don't have access to an enterprise google account to test against.. Regarding your last comment (it just loaded for me):\nThat test you performed may be a bit misleading. Was the page you redirected a problematic google docs page? And how did you do the redirection? \nWhat happens if you try something like this?\nchrome.tabs.query({url: 'docs.google.com'}, function (tabs) {\n  var tab = tabs[0];\n  chrome.tabs.update(tab.id, {url: `chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=${encodeURIComponent(tab.title)}&uri=${tab.url}`}, function (result) { console.log(result); });\n}\nThe reason the suspended tab you're seeing does not have a title is because there is no database entry representing the suspended tab you're referencing with the url. And notice the favicon is not a 'suspended' version of the favicon, it's just the fallback favicon found by appending 'chrome://favicon/' before the url.. Cool, thanks for all your help with this. I've made some changes to the upcoming release that will allow for basic suspend and popup functionality even when the content script is unresponsive.\nYou will now be able to suspend or whitelist a tab without needing a content script. But auto-suspend won't work as the timer is in the content script and I do not want to duplicate this logic in the background process.. Installing locally will give you a new extension id. That means a completely separate local storage and so a different set of options and session history. \nYou can run both versions at the same time, but it gets confusing as to which extension is doing what.\nIf you disable the webstore version, all of your suspended tabs will disappear. So you'll need to uninstall them first. I recommend installing session buddy to be safe, and save your session before uninstalling.\nLet me know if i haven't been clear about any of this.\n. The implementation of storing scroll position has been overhauled in the upcoming version of the extension (v7.x).\nThis change was instigated because of the following issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/543#issuecomment-317222078. @mimiheart thanks for this report.\nI have fixed the issue in the github version (v7.0.80).\nIt was caused by a chrome change in v61: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=766938. This has been implemented in the upcoming release (v7.x).\nI have repurposed the 'Suspend active tab' shortcut to also unsuspend a suspended tab.\nThe original 'Unsuspend active tab' shortcut still exists for backwards compatibility. Both will now unsuspend a tab.. As mentioned in the linked issue, if you want your whitelist to be accessible in incognito mode, you will need to enable the settings sync feature coming out in the next release (v7.x).. Yes, I am aware of this issue. It's not that bad, considering that discarding a tab is fairly equivalent (or maybe even better) than suspending a tab memory-wise.\nUnfortunately an extension cannot interact with chrome flags.\nBut it does look like I can detect when a tab is discarded, at least, after a tab has been discarded. I could then reload and suspend it.\nI'll make this a feature request.. This has been implemented in the upcoming release.\nThe option actually reads \"Instantly suspend when system memory gets very low\"\nbut it does exactly as requested. When a tab gets discarded (ie: because the system memory has gotten really low), then it will undiscard it and suspend it instead.\nThe main motivator for implementing this was so that I can still interact with the tab (for functionality like 'unsuspend all'). With discarded tab, it also prevents communication via content scripts.. @johnkershaw thanks for the feedback. i'm hoping that this is simply a case of tabs being suspended after they discard. it does seem odd that it's happening so frequently though.\nwe can see for sure what is happening if you turn debugging on and give me a copy of the log after it happens. \nto turn on debugging, open the extension options page, and then change the word 'options.htlm' in the url to 'debug.html' \nonce on the debugging tab, you can toggle error and info logging on at the top of the page.. I have never been able to replicate this. And there is very little documentation on exactly when the background page can be relied on to exist.\nI have added some safety checks into the suspended tab page in the upcoming release which will first perform a wait in the background page is initially unavailable, and then fallback on sensible defaults for the page if it never becomes available: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/7154895e928a12317f66120852def6796b1b9c33\n(This was done to resolve your issues is: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/591)\nThis means in worst case, the suspended tabs will still be functional and have proper title and favicons set.. Related to: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/559. This feature has actually been rewritten in the upcoming release (v7.x).\nIt will now actually load the page and then suspend it. This gives it access to the real page title and favicon.\nSee https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/572. Follow this issue for latest updates: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537\ntldr: really soon!. Please refer to issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/467\nThe upcoming version (v7.x) has a new option to 'force suspend all tabs in all windows'. This will be available as a right-click menu option, and as a keyboard shortcut.. I'm tempted to say \"that's awesome!\" but do not want to undermine your issue :D \nBut seriously, that is the most odd thing I've ever seen. Do you have screen capture turned on? Is it possible that an actual screenshot image (if you inspect the page)? Or is it just a graphical glitch displaying the suspended tab page?\nIf the latter, then I'd say it's a native chrome issue.. This is strange. That url you posted does not seem to be valid. Are you sure that is how it was? It seems to be missing the extension id. I would expect something more like: \nchrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=effects%2Ftesting.md%20at%20master%20%C2%B7%20ngrx%2Feffects&uri=https://github.com/ngrx/effects/blob/master/docs/testing.md\nNavigating to your url as you pasted it leads me to a page that says \"Suspended.html is blocked\".\nAnd refreshing this page does not take me to another suspended page.\nAre you able to give me a screenshot of both the first AND second stages of this problem?. @dragGH102 thanks a lot for the extra info.\nit appears to be a duplicate of this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/597\nif you wanted to do me a REALLY big favour, would you be interested in trialling the new alpha build of the extension? I have made some changes to try to address this issue, but i'm not 100% confident that it will have any effect.\nInstructions on installing can be found here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender#install-as-an-extension-from-source\nIf you do want to try out the new version, I would recommend either leaving the existing version installed, but change the suspend time to 'never', or disabling the current version (but make sure you unsuspend all your tabs first!).\n. @dragGH102 sorry for the hassle. this is why i recommended that you leave the v6.30 version of the extension installed but set to 'never' for the suspend time. Or alternatively, I suggested that you should unsuspend all your tabs before removing the 6.30 version.\nAs liamjohnston said, if you want to receive automatic updates, you should stay with the webstore version. The development version was just for you to test if your issue still happens in the newer version.\nThanks for giving it a go! Hope I haven't caused you too much hassle.. @griii2 :\nThe size of the screen capture is dependent on the window size of the browser and the resolution of the monitor the browser is displayed on when the screen capture is taken.\nIs it possible that the screen captures were taken on a different monitor, or with a browser at a different size than the one currently displaying it?\nCan you please verify this by suspending an unsuspended tab, and then checking if it exhibits the same issue? If so, can you please paste a screenshot of this happening into this issue thread?\nThanks.. This is possibly the same issue as: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/211\n. There have been some changes made to the html2canvas library in how it captures the screen on retina screens: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/562\nThese changes are in the upcoming release. Perhaps they will fix your issue?\nAlso, the new release will shrink screen captures that are larger than the current window down to fit. This should also resolve your problem.. New version is coming really soon. It is currently still in alpha and going through testing so I cannot push it to the chrome webstore just yet. \nSorry about the delay!. This is not an issue per se. Just intended behaviour. The current gitHub version is in alpha (v7.0-alpha-50). It has not been thoroughly tested and therefore has not been pushed out live to everybody.\nIf you want this release in advance, you have no option but to install as you have done via developer mode. The message you are receiving from chrome is a choice made on their part (the chrome developers). I assume it is there as a security precaution. It is outside of my ability to change this, and anyone installing chrome extensions from source must experience this.\nThere will be an official webstore version of v7.x soon. This will automatically update any older webstore version you have installed (most likely v6.30).. This is a known issue with v6.30: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/564\nIt will be fixed in the upcoming release (v7.x)\nSorry for the annoying bug!. Yes unfortunately, this is not under my control.\nThe only other option available (other than right-click or the popup menu) is using the keyboard shortcuts. This is probably the most convenient way to suspend all tabs.. As suggested in: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/339\nThis could also have an option to automatically move tabs to the right when they become suspended.. This is a duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/519\nThis was intentionally changed, but due to user feedback it will be reverted back to how it used to work in the upcoming release (v7.x).. The bulk of this work is in these commits:\n- https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/2c749d9a31b280f2dc727ecebc5a5aeabc8695d3\n- https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/b8f0d0b68f69ffe2d31bd91da83e49713f3335b1. Will mark as duplicate: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537. @DAOWAce Actually, this looks like an issue with the internationalization. I notice that there's the word 'other' rendering ok in that screenshot. That's because I forgot to internationalize that particular string :/\nAre you still having the invisible text issue? I imagine it probably affects all the internal screens within the extension? (ie. suspended tab page, session history page etc) ?\nIf so, are you able to open the developer console and tell me if you can see any errors?\nI have tried debugging with browser stack on a chrome v51 instance (via OSX sierra) and can't see the same issue.. @DAOWAce I agree that working with development extensions can be a PITA. especially with The Great Suspender if you have suspended tabs from another installation of the extension.\nNo worries. I'll try to do some more testing via BrowserStack. Thanks for the info you have already provided.. hmmm.. ok. thanks for this. it's super helpful.\ncould you tell me the exact OS and version of chrome you're running?\nand also, in that console window in the bottom-right of your screenshot, what happens if you type chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage() in there?. ok. thanks a lot. \nit looks like some of the code in the new release is not supported by chrome v51. i'll see if i can work around this.. I've bumped up the minimum required version of chrome to v55 :(. @fwextensions this sounds like a separate issue (and a bug). would you mind opening a new issue for this (the favicons not updating properly). \nLikewise for the feature request of being able to count the number of suspended tabs.\nHappy to discuss both of these things more, but would prefer to keep this issue focussed on memory issues.. @Pascal666 i probably dont need too much information. This thread is more of a placeholder to get a general idea of how bad the issue is and the different ways it is affecting people.\nSomething like @robgott's response is probably all that's required.\nThanks for your input though!. Thats correct. This was by design. Although at the time I never imagined that people may have over 100 different windows open.\nI thought that it would be nice to always have the active tab of each window unsuspended, but in the case of 100 windows, it would probably be preferable to have these suspend.\nI will try to address this issue soon.. This has been implemented and will be available in the next release.. Can you give a bit more information on your proposition? Like some examples perhaps?\nI do not understand what you mean by:\n\nso this doesn't save traffic, only memory for a given N minutes.\n\nAnd I also dont see the relationship between how long you spend on a focussed tab, and the time it should take to suspend a tab in the background.\nWhy would you want these two things to be the same?. 1) please refer to this open issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/265\n2) this sounds like a bug (not always auto-reloading). Most probably it is caused by this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/519\nAlso, there is already a feature that auto-scrolls to the same location on the page before the tab was suspended. so you shouldn't have to rescroll down like you are doing. This is a bug if so, and should be reported in a separate issue.\n3) this sounds like a repeat of issue 1? you would like to save the suspended tab contents saved to disk so that you can do an offline reload? that would make it irrelevant whether the page had become unreachable.\nI'm sorry, but I am still not seeing exactly what issue you are trying to solve. The points you raise (1,2,3) do not relate to the tab suspension timer. Are you suggesting that the time to suspend should be based on how long a the user has a specific tab focused (while unsuspended)?\nI can't see the relationship between the time a user spends READING a tab, and the time it should take for that tab to be suspended automatically in the background. Just because I have opened a tab that I will spend 10 minutes (on average) reading, does not mean that that tab should be automatically suspended after looking at OTHER tabs for 11 minutes... 'Dont suspend for now' IS already in the menu bar popup. Perhaps you were just on a tab that didn't support this option (ie. already suspended or already whitelisted).\nAm I correct in interpreting your first request as an options to 'Dont suspend tabs that have high network usage'?\nAre you talking about frequent network usage? Or heavy network usage?\nNot sure if this is feasible with the current chrome API.\nWhat is your use-case for such a feature? It is to keep tabs playing audio and video from suspending?\nThe purpose of this extension is actually to try to suspend these very active tabs, as they tend to be the ones using a lot of computer resources... Are you able to paste a screenshot of one of these tabs?\nWhat happens if you right-click on the tab favicon and choose 'Duplicate'?. Does this happen slowly over time? Or is it from a browser restart? If you suspend a new tab manually, or let it time-out in the background, does it have the same problem?. I'm almost certain this is only an issue on chrome restart when reloading a lot of suspended tabs.\nYou're correct that it leverages the chrome://favicon cache.\nHowever it has nothing to do with the suspended tab being in the database. These tabs are always in the database, this happens when the tab is first suspended.\nI think the problem is in how chrome prioritises tab reloads on chrome restart. You will notice that it staggers the reloading of non-focused tabs trying to get the focussed tabs fully functional first. It seems that for some of these background tabs, it never allows the js on the extended page to run - this is what updates the favicon and page title.\nBut when you give one of these tabs focus, it then runs the page load js, and the favicon and title update as expected.\nAs you suggested, a workaround could be to send a message out to all of these tabs. However without being able to reproduce this issue, I'm not sure how these tabs would respond (if at all) to such a request.\nI will do some tests and see if i can recreate the issue.. I can't remember sorry, but are you using the webstore version of The Great Suspender? Or the latest release from here?\nIt would be great if you wanted to test out the latest alpha build: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.0-alpha.72\nBut be careful if disabling the webstore version. Make sure you have unsuspended all your tabs first.\n. Well the code has changed significantly since the current webstore version so I wouldn't focus too much on that. But I'll check out the sequence of updates on the latest codebase to see if it's doing something similar.\nYes, you can just set the webstore version to 'never suspend' and the tabs will stay suspended. It just gets slightly confusing having too instances of the extension open, as you can't always tell which one is doing what.\nI usually use session buddy to have a backup as well. It handles suspended tabs well, and you can restore all the tabs in a suspended state so long as you have the right version of The Great Suspender installed.. @liamjohnston did you have an opinion on the above comment regarding \"system-ui\" ? (the one after your reply). @fwextensions the fact that the favicon seems to resolve itself when focused makes me think this must be something to do with how chrome handles the processing of scripts. there definitely is some kind of limiting and queueing that goes on during a browser restart where a lot of tabs are restored.\nit looks like in rare instances, some of these tabs just never get a chance to have their scripts run, until they are given priority when they gain focus.\ni guess we can chalk this up to a chrome bug?. @fwextensions Sorry if i've asked you this before, but can you give me the version of chrome and your operating system? I'll do some tests in a virtual machine to see if I can repro. On my work computer i can't.. @fwextensions still unable to reproduce :(\nI have made a video of my attempt. using an emulated win7 on chrome v64: https://youtu.be/r1RJlpicBjU\nIs there anything in that video that is different to what you are trying to do?\nI even made sure that the webstore version of the extension was installed as well, and the suspended tabs are a mix of tabs suspended from both versions of the extension.. Due to the length of this issue thread, and all of the different issues it talks about, i've decided to close it and refer to a more specific version of the main issue.\nFor the issue of suspended tabs not updating their favicon and title on chrome RESTART: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/719\nIf your issue involves bad favicons but is not happening on restart, then please open a new issue.\n. Will paste it here directly:\n\n. I don't think this is related to the extension. \nBut then again, I have no idea what could cause something like this. \nPerhaps your graphics card? I'm really sorry, I have no idea.. This has already been fixed in the most recent version.\nIt won't be out today, but i'm hoping for the next couple of weeks.. @fcherman this is worrisome. have you tried many different pages? have you tried restarting chrome? do you still have the webstore version of the extension installed?\nthere is also a new option when screen capturing is turned on called \"Enable screen capture on zoomed tabs\". Have you tried enabling this?. @corylulu thanks for this. unfortunately i have made significant changes to contentscript.js since you wrote this code :(\nAs it currently stands, there is an issue with this PR when it tries to detect if all editedInputControls still have non-empty values. The actual editedInputControls array will only contain the first input that gets edited, after that, i am removing the eventListener.\nThis can be easily fixed by simply not turning off the keylistener, however, i didn't want the contentscript to be too intrusive, especially when listening to keyboard input, so i tried to make it as minimal as possible. I don't like the idea of every tab listening to every keypress and performing logic based on that.\nSo the end result is that i'll probably just manually add your improvement for the HTML5 form inputs, and leave the rest out :(. Here's the commit for facebook comment support: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/1fce9e9adc3ee97a8d080be8fa1afec8cadac8f6\nAnd I have created an issue to address the other part of your PR: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/654\nThanks for your time with this!. I have just switched it over to my public GitHub repo. Feel free to contribute!. There is a tooltip ? icon in the options page which will give you examples on how to use the regex feature.\nThere is also more information here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/197\nEssentially, you can define a regex like this on a new line in the whitelist:\n/someregex.*/. @fwextensions just a couple more things.\nthe 'timeout' trying to contact the extension is actually just waiting for the tab to load (plus about 1 second after as the actual timeout).\nonce the tab has loaded, i can then test for the content script. so it only takes a long time on tabs which take a long time to finish loading. \nI like your suggestions for the improved wording. I have made the changes :)\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/567448943d089b0d46a3eb5950f3358b6100f09b. I did a major rewrite of the suspended tab page on Jan 4th 2018: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/144fd5c49b1660507ff1453ae837b5c8a0962f87#diff-b45940944d233d9ccdd651384fc57fca\nThis should allow a semi-transparent icon even if the content script fails to load.\nLet me know if you come across this issue in the future (as of v7.0.77). @fwextensions I have just tagged a new release (v7.0-alpha.85)\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.0-alpha.85. I'm pretty sure I know what was causing this, and it should now be fixed (v7.0.81).\nI think that the extension was detecting that the suspended tab was unresponsive, so it was reloading it to be safe. Please let me know if you continue to experience this issue.. Yes. That is normal as it is trying to repeatedly contact the content script. These errors are not normally logged, however it seems you have debug=true set in your gsUtils.js file?\nWhich is good, if you want to help me with debugging :D \nOn production these will be set to false and no errors will be logged.. Ah yes. By production, I meant the chrome webstore.\nI should probably ensure that debugging is also off for tagged releases in the repo too.\nThanks for the heads up.. Can you give me a bit more information?\nDo you mean the tab doesn't auto-suspend? Or that you can't manually suspend it (by clicking on 'Suspend this tab' in the popup menu).\nAlso, do you have the 'Never suspend tabs that contain unsaved form inputs' option checked?\nAnd what version of the extension are you on?. I can't replicate this sorry.\nWith v6.30, and screen capturing enabled, it suspends with a screen capture without issue.\nCan you try opening up the developer tools on the tab, and paste any information that is outputted there after choosing to manually suspend the tab?. This sounds like a duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/657\nAlthough, in the most recent version (v7.0.102) the links you posted now seem to capture without issue.. Thanks for that. It has been fixed (v7.0.78)\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/3c956e34cbcb2b672affd29956bf2efdcd88772f. I've found a way to fix this for suspending also.. Unfortunately this is unavoidable. It is due to the way that tabs are suspended. They redirect to a local page that is hosted by the extension, and these local pages cannot accept keyboard shortcuts from other extensions.\nThis issue has been discussed in more detail here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/271\n. I agree that this might be a nice improvement to the 'Dont suspend for now' option.\nIt could perhaps be renamed to 'Dont suspend this tab'.\nThe original use-case for this option was when listening to music through youtube and you didn't want the tab to suspend in the background. (This has since been superceeded by the 'dont suspend tabs playing audio' option).\nI'm not sure how many people use this option now, and what they use it for. It would be good to know this, and if it turns out most people want the tab to be more permanently exempt, I will advocate for changing it. . @kankaristo I have addressed your issue above (for the audio issue), and also implemented the hotkey in the upcoming release.. As @CollinChaffin mentioned, clicking 'unsuspend all' in the popup menu should handle the change over. If you do not want to have to reload all your tabs, then the script posted by @fwextensions in this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/689 may also act as a workaround.. The whitelist supports regular expressions. If you are familiar with them, then they should be able to achieve what you are after.\nFor example, you can use the $ character to specify the end of the url. So entering into the whitelist:\n/boards\\/catalog$/\nwill ONLY whitelist urls that have the word catalog at the very end, like: \n...boards/catalog\nWhereas:\n/boards\\/catalog/\nwill whitelist both: \n...boards/catalog\nand\n...boards/catalog/thread\nNote that you need to escape any / characters with a proceeding \\ \nAnd the entire whitelist string needs to have the / character at the beginning and end.\n. Link to original feature request: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/197. Actually, the popup menu option 'Unsuspend all tabs' actually only unsuspends tabs in the current window (ie. it does exactly the same thing as the right-click menu option - it's just worded differently).\nConversely, if you actually do want to unsuspend all tabs in all windows, THEN you must use the right-click menu option, as this option does not appear in the popup menu.. Are the errors you are getting 400s?\nIt is most likely this bug: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537\n. I'm not 100% sure what your work flow is with this.\nFirstly, this is assuming that a person works with tabs in a sequential order? So that most likely, after finishing with a tab, they will then proceed to the next tab (to the right?).\nSo the use case is, you have opening a lot of tabs a long time ago and they have all suspended. Now you go to one and unsuspend it, and you would like the one 'after' that to also unsuspend so that it is already loaded when you want to look at it?\nJust trying to clarify the feature request. Thanks.. @meteorplus As mentioned in the main issue thread, the release process is non-trivial for me, and i will not be able to do a hotfix release for this issue (that includes this PR).\nAs for fixing the issue more permanently, this has already been done in master branch. I am sorry this is taking so long to make it to the webstore. But it IS coming. I am now working on this project full time until this release out. \n. @meteorplus it's being rolled out now.. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce this.\nDoes this happen for you consistently?\nWhat OS are you using, which version of chrome, and what version of the extension?\nAnd are you talking about closing chrome down completely (with a suspended tab as the active tab).\nAnd then opening chrome again later?. @jdille For sure Jack. Thanks for the offer. Get in touch with @liamjohnston. He's in charge of the styling for the project :)\nAlso, check out the latest version in the repo first (as opposed to that on the webstore). Things have changed a fair amount since then.. duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/309. @CollinChaffin can you please give me a bit more information on this?\nI'm not seeing the blocked redirects you're speaking of.\nAnd can you also post a link of the 'chrome changes' that you are referring to?\nAnd finally, the version of chrome you currently use, and a working example of a website that fails to suspend properly.\nThanks :). @bill-mcgonigle I am unable to recreate this. What version of the extension are you using? And what version of chrome do you have? And finally, what operating system?. @CollinChaffin Sorry, I just realised that you're on the chrome dev channel. But still, I cannot reproduce the blocking errors you're seeing.\nAs for the errors being logged to the console, that has been fixed in the latest version (v7.0.82).\nCan somebody please give me more information on how i can reproduce the new blocking functionality?. @CollinChaffin I just can't seem to replicate this issue.\nHere are the exact steps I have tried:\n- Chrome Dev:  v66.0.3359.26\n- Ensure flag: #enable-framebusting-needs-sameorigin-or-usergesture is enabled\n- Extension version: v7.0.85 (I have also tried v6.30)\n- Open about 30 random tabs (many of them google search tabs)\n- Wait for them to autosuspend (i have it set to 20 seconds)\n- Ensure that they all suspend automatically\nWhat do you think I'm doing differently to you? \nI cannot get that popup blocked icon to appear that you have posted an image of.\n. Don't worry. You have my full attention, you don't need to garner extra community support. I am treating this as a major potential issue. Having users manually setting chrome flags is not an option. If this is going to affect all users in an upcoming release, then a fixed version of the extension needs to be released BEFORE this happens.\nHowever, I'm not convinced that the other issues you refer to are caused by the same issue you are experiencing. Specifically:\nIssue #661: if you look at the imgur screenshot posted, this issue has something to do with the content script for the google sheets tab not being contactable. \nIssue #660 has been resolved. \nIssue #657 is an html2canvas library issue.\nAlso, I am still unable to reproduce. I'm really sorry.\nMy current setup is:\n- Chrome Dev Version 66.0.3359.26\n- TGS v6.30\n- Framebusting flag still enabled\nI have tried going to your https://www.solarwinds.com/downloads page and opening every trial box in a new tab, and from there clicking on all the download links after filling out the form.\nWhen downloading the files, I did initially get a popup blocked notification which i then allowed (by turning of the block popups option in chrome). After this the files were able to download successfully.\nAt no point did I get a 'redirect blocked' notification. \nFor good measure I then tried suspending all the open tabs and they all suspended without issue.\nPerhaps this has something to do with the fact that I do not use chrome dev very often? But even then, my production chrome also has the framebusting flag set, and I'm not seeing issues there either.\n\u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n. I think this can probably be classified as a duplicate of #317 (Auto close suspended tab after certain amount of time).\nSee also #281 (Ability to close all suspended tabs).\nThere is a few subtle differences however:\n- Auto-closing should only happen on windows 'pre-tagged' as auto-closing.\n- Tabs must be visited at least once. I'm not sure of the benefit of this?\n- Some favicon manipulation to indicate tabs that will auto-close.\nI think the first step would be to address the other issues. And then maybe come back to this at a later date.. Confirmed.\nI have this with a few other extensions also. React developer tools, and privacy badger.\nAlthough it seems that the latest test build of The Great Suspender has no issues with this.. Hi. See this issue: #519. Incognito mode uses a separate storage for it's own preferences and also throws away any changes made to these preferences after the incognito window is closed (as it should being incognito).\nSee this issue: #468\nNote that there is a pending new feature to sync settings across chrome profiles. With this enabled, incognito mode will be able to sync it's settings with that of the normal window, which will resolve your issue.\nSee: #262. The screen capturing is done with an external js library called html2canvas. It is not perfect, but the best solution currently available for taking screenshots of a tab that is not currently active in the browser.\nThe current webstore version of the extension uses an older version of this library. The upcoming release has a more updated version. Here is an example of a screen capture of the same page on the newer version of html2canvas:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/MTCgw\nFor more info on why I am using this library, see this thread: #503 . Sorry, I dont understand your question.\nWhy are you opening new tabs via the context menu?\nIt doesn't sound like your issue has anything to do with this extension? . This is possible - depending on the implementation. I don't think I can specifically override the 'ctrl+click' functionality, but i could add an option so that all new tabs that are opened but not given focus are automatically suspended. Is that what you are looking for?\nI'm just not sure this would be a good idea as it could result in some confusion for users... How about just setting the 'time to suspend' to 20 seconds? Does that give you a similar outcome?. @dumblob it sounds like you're speaking of a slightly different feature. that is, automatically suspend all tabs on startup. this is already a separate issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/49\nI'll add some info about Native Lazy Tabs there.. @dumblob ok understood. but there is quite a difference in those two scenarios. opening 60 tabs one at a time from search results is a much more staggered process, and therefore produces much less load on the system.\nfor this new scenario, are you aware of the right-click 'open in new suspended tab' option? it will cause the link to open in a new tab, and as soon as it's loaded, it will immediately suspend it. i suspect if you do this for a whole lot of links manually, you'll have the first ones suspending pretty early on in the process.\nthe only downside to this is having to open each tab via a right-click menu option which may be cumbersome if you're used to using something like cmd/ctrl+click, or using the middle mouse button.\nif this is your situation (ie: the existing 'open in suspended tab' functionality is not good enough), then this gitHub issue is to address exactly this. It's saying, when i choose perform the 'open in new tab' action (regardless of how i do this), then actually load the tab and subsequently suspend it.. I suspect you are correct in your assumptions (i couldn't find the more tools -> add to desktop.. option on my chrome?).\nThis has been raised as an issue already in a slightly different context: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/614\nI don't think i'd go down the route of treating them differently to normal tabs, but including an option to allow active tabs to suspend is a possibility.\nI'll close this as duplicate. Feel free to add your 2c to the other issue :). This has been implemented and will be available in the next release. I'm still optimistically hoping of the next month for the new release.\nAs for updates, if you follow the linked issue (#614) it will be given a tag of 'released' once the release is in the chrome webstore.. I have been able to reliably reproduce this.\nIt's important to note that it only occurs if the 'screen capturing' option is turned on.\nIt is an issue with the html2canvas library that I use. I have raised an issue on that project: https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/issues/1466\nThe current alpha build of TGS will not fail to suspend on this page, however, it will not be able to produce the screenshot and will just show a normal blank suspended tab page.. People have suggested using https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image instead of html2canvas (as a solution to the above issue).\nI will look into this as part of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/677. I have added support for the dom-to-image screencapture library. Although it appears to be much slower, and also less reliable than html2canvas.\nYou can switch to the dom-to-image library by going to the extension debug.html page (chrome-extension:///debug.html) and toggling the \"useAlternateScreenCaptureLib\" option.. I am unable to recreate this sorry.\n@dhruvhalwasiya @talmagal @cldershem can you give me a bit more information about the extension version you are using, the version of chrome you are using, and your operating system?\nif any of you are good with computers, could you try doing some debugging for me?\nif you navigate to chrome://extensions/ and then click on 'background page' under the great suspender, and then look at the 'Console' tab of the Developer Tools window to see if any errors are being reported.\nalso, if you click on the 'Application' tab of Developer Tools, and then navigate to IndexedDB -> tgs -> gsCurrentSessions you should be able to browse the raw data of your sessions.. @talmagal i doubt it would be caused by a large number of tabs. but a corruption sounds likely.\ni don't suppose you're able to send me a copy of the corrupted files by chance? if i can see what it looks like in a corrupted state, then i will be able to make sure i handle that case in a future release and recovery from it nicely without the user having to clear their history or reinstall... Hmmm.. i tried using your files, but it treated it the same as it would if the folder didn't exist at all. ie. the sessions screen looks normal with a single 'current session' and no entires for 'recent sessions' or 'saved sessions'.\nNot sure where to go from here sorry.. I'm sorry. I cannot reproduce this.\nJust a few questions. \n- What version of the extension are you using?\n- Do you have the screen capture option enabled? Does it work if you disable this?\n- What happens if you click on the extension icon and click 'suspend this tab'?. Is it possibly related to this issue? #646\nWhat version of chrome are you using and what version of the extension?\nI have been unable to reproduce this :(. @kcanini while on the google spreadsheets tab, if you right-click on the extension icon and select 'inspect popup' do you see any errors in the console of the developer tools window that appears?. And what about the console of the google sheets tab itself?\nAnd if you go into chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, then inspect the background page for the extension, are there any errors in the console there?\nFinally, do you still have the problem if you refresh the google sheets tab?\nAnd how about after closing the tab, and then reopening it.\nIs it a regular google sheets page? (ie. a spreadsheet you are working on). afaik, when you inspect the popup, that's just the scope of the popup page itself. if it's the popup throwing errors, they will appear in the console there, not in the console of the extension's background_page.\none more thought. are you using enterprise google docs? i forgot about it but there was another person having a very similar issue to you: #591\nsorry for only mentioning this now!\n. Even though I cannot reproduce, I will assume that this issue will be made redundant by the upcoming release v7.x\nWill most likely be addressed in the fix to: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/591. This should already be the case. I have tested this and it works as expected. If I minimise a window with many tabs, and then wait for the defined automatic suspension time, and then unminimise the window, all tabs except the active one are now visible.. An interesting idea. Currently, it remembers the scroll position of the unsuspended tab, and then will set the scroll position of the screen capture to the same position. And also set the tab back to this position once unsuspended.\nBut you're suggesting that if you change that scroll position by scrolling the screen capture, this new position should be used when unsuspending rather than the original scroll position before suspension.\nI'm curious to know if you were aware of the current functionality that i described above. Do you think that your implementation is more intuitive?. Yes, there is a bug in v6.30 where the remembering of scroll position doesn't work: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/592\nAs @liamjohnston said, on unsuspend, the tab will return to the scroll position it was at before the tab was suspended.\nThis works no matter what options you have set for screen capturing. Although if you do have screen capturing set to 'Capture entire page' then it will also scroll to that location on the screen capture as well.. I will close this as there is no real resolution. But feel free to create a new issue to address the 'extension stops responding after x tabs open'.. @ohsix i'm not sure where to go from here. is there something concrete I can do to resolve this issue? what are the factors that contribute towards this failure? is it purely the number of suspended tabs open? or is there some way I can reduce the amount of resources each suspended tab uses?  . I'm not that familiar with debian sorry.\nI tried installing debian stretch with gnome via virtualbox.\nI installed chrome v65 and was able to add the extension and use it without issue.\nAm I missing something in my test scenario?\nAny ideas where to go from here?. Sorry about that. There's no way to disable that warning unfortunately. The best you can do is keep and eye on the youtube issue thread and switch back once the release is live on the webstore.. there is some form of feedback already.\nafter you whitelist, the suspended tab should reload.\nand if you look at the extension icon, it should now be grey instead of orange which indicates that this tab will NOT be suspended automatically.\nif you click on the icon the popup will give you extra feedback (see image):\n\n. I'm unable to recreate this sorry.\nYou can try navigating to this url: chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/profiler.html\nIt will show you the status of each tab. When you have the \"Only auto-suspend if running on battery\" and the laptop is plugged in, the status of each tab should read \"charging\". \nIf you unplug your laptop and then refresh that page, the status should change to \"normal\".\nNOTE: You may need to wait about 30 seconds before they switch to normal, as it can take some time for chrome to broadcast the change in charging state for some reason.\n. Even though I cannot reproduce, I will assume that this issue will be made redundant by the upcoming release v7.x. Duplicate: #659\nI believe I've been in contact with you about this over email. \nSorry I wasn't able to be of much help :(.

I can't see any reference to the full url on the suspended tab page (except for the hyperlink when you hover the title).\nEven the whitelist modal does not give any part of the url after the ?  symbol..

Last time I looked it was using the same library as this one. but perhaps they've found a better alternative.\n. I have added support for the dom-to-image screencapture library. Although it appears to be much slower, and also less reliable than html2canvas.\nYou can switch to the dom-to-image library by going to the extension debug.html page (chrome-extension:///debug.html) and toggling the \"useAlternateScreenCaptureLib\" option.. It seems now that any youtube tab will fail to capture a screenshot (with html2canvas). The library returns a valid dataURL but the contents of it are blank.. Thanks for this. I can recreate it. Although, it only seems to do it when reimporting the same file? \nNot sure what's going on here but I'll take a look.. @davidpat99 are you able to confirm that it only overwrites a session that was imported via exactly the same source file? Or are you actually losing sessions that contain different data?. @sfaris @sfaris-bw \nYou can go to the url: chrome-extension://jmhiginckkdplecbbnnfcapnpofhmgbb/debug.html\nThat should show you the current status of each tab. Tabs with a status of 'normal' will be suspended. And the time-to-suspend will show you at what time that tab is due to be suspended.\nLet me know if this helps. Also, at the top of that debug page, you can toggle debugInfo and debugErrors. This will cause logging to the background_page console. Perhaps the debugging page does not help, I can go through this with you.  . oh, I'm sorry. that's the wrong extension id (that's my local testing one).\nyou will need to substitute 'jmhiginckkdplecbbnnfcapnpofhmgbb' from that url i gave you with whatever the extension id is for you locally.\nyou can find this ID by going to chrome://extensions/ and searching for The Great Suspender. I'm so sorry about this @FNCxPro but I have already implemented this :(\nSee: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/614\nThanks a lot for your contribution though. . @shanedrgn thanks also for this. i'm actually on the same page as @liamjohnston about making it a permanent feature. it's very much in keeping with functionality that remembers the scroll position of the page.\nis it possible to keep the original youtube url and just add the timestamp parameter?\nwhen you say, you're worried about other extensions that rely on the url, you're talking about the original youtube url (that would show after unsuspending the tab)?\n. Thanks @shanedrgn \nI'll look at merging it now. I hope you don't mind but I will probably make a few changes before merging.\nI would like to add the youtube timestamp as a url param of the suspended tab url. Similar to what I do with the scroll position. That way it will survive a browser restart (the timestamp position will be stored in the url).. ah ok. you're modifying the actual youtube url before it gets suspended. i was expecting the youtube timestamp to be a searchParam on the suspended url like how it works for scrollPos. \nbut actually, doing it your way makes sense seeing as it's specific to just youtube.\ni'll make some changes and then get you to review it as there's still some things I'd like to change. The codebase is not well documented so it's not always obvious the \"right way\" to go about something.\nAlso, there's a bug in that it doesn't work when tabs are suspended manually. But that will fix itself with my changes.. @shanedrgn \nI have created a new PR with my changes: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/684\n. There's a bit of history already to this request.\nFirstly, there is already a feature where you can right click on a link and choose 'open link in new suspended tab'. In the latest version (unreleased) this will full load the site in a new background tab, and once it has finished loading, it will suspend it. There is already an issue related to this feature: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/572\nIt does this (the loading first) because otherwise there would be no way to find out the correct page title and favicon for the site. If I simply opened the link in a new already suspended tab, then the suspended tab would have no favicon or page title. This is pretty unusable. There are exceptions to this. If the site has already been suspended recently, then it's possible that I could reuse the favicon and page title. But this is not guaranteed, so I made the decision to not allow it at all.\nThere is also another issue already in existence which requests that all tabs that are opened in a background tab should be suspended automatically. This is to avoid having go through the right click context menu (ie. when using ctrl+click to open a link): https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/655\nThis is perhaps what you mean when you say \"a feature for the suspender to automatically suspend tabs that open in background\".\nAnd finally, your request which seems to be the ability to open a whole session as already suspended tabs. I have a few questions about that, and some potential solutions.\n\n\nHow are you currently re-opening your 'daily' tabs? Using another session manager extension? Or perhaps with chromes 'reopen where i left off' ?\n\n\nDepend on your answer to question 1, you might find that what you're after already exists. If you restore a session and some of those tabs are suspended in that session, then when you reload the session they will reload as already suspended.\n\n\nAre you aware that The Great Suspender has a session management feature? If you go to settings -> session management. From there you can save sessions (like your daily session), and you can also choose to reopen a session with 'resuspend' which will open all the tabs in that session as suspended.\n\n\nHope that helps. Let me know.\n. Chrome does do some batching. As in, it will progressively load the tabs. But it still generally uses 100% CPU.\nOnce you've loaded all your bookmarks, you should be able to save those tabs as a session in the session manager of The Great Suspender.\nThen in future you should be able to reload the session from there rather than bookmarks.\nBut to be honest, the session manager in this extension is not the best. You're probably better off using an extension like Session Buddy. If the session you have in session buddy has already suspended tabs, they will reopen as suspended.. @shanedrgn \nI have boiled the code down to simply updating tab.url just before a tab gets suspended. I'm doing this in gsSuspendManager which is the funnel through which every tab gets run before it is suspended.\nTo prevent any new code being added to the contentscript (which gets run on every single tab), i am using code injection to obtain the timestamp from the tab dom only if the url matches that of youtube.\nTo test for a youtube page, i'm simply doing an indexOf looking for the string \"https://www.youtube.com/watch\". Your regex was much more permissive than this, but I can't see why the url would be anything other than what I have written above?\n. Just in the last hour actually \ud83d\ude0a\nBut I know the code really well, so that makes a huge difference.\nThanks again for your PR. It's a great addition to the extension \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks a lot for this PR. \nReally nice code.\nI made a few tweaks, including swapping out the js confirm popup for a dedicated page.\nI also added support for whitelisting file urls. I'm not sure what you meant by it not working, or even breaking the extension. Can you elaborate on this?\nThere was one issue when choosing 'whitelist domain' on a file url. I added some code to interpret this as: use the folder path, but not the filename.. Yes. This stopped working when coinbase moved to the new coinbase merchant platform.\nIt will be re-enabled in the upcoming release.\nIn the meantime, if you really want to donate, here is a link to the new cypto donation page:\nhttps://commerce.coinbase.com/charges/HRHXRR53\nThanks!. Sorry about the late reply on this.\nThere was a brief period in time when I thought it would be a good idea to unsuspend all tabs before updating. I since realised this was a very BAD idea and removed the code.\nAFAIK, the current beta release should not exhibit this behaviour.. @fwextensions It's definitely something I've considered before. I'm trying to find an old issue where I've commented on this before, but I can't seem to find it.\nFrom memory, my main objection to this was the impact it would have on chrome restart. It is actually one of the things I enjoy most about the extension is how quickly it restarts when all the tabs can be loaded locally.\nThat said, the upside is significant. I'll do some investigation to get a feel for what this might look like.\nAs mentioned in your other related issue, it won't be in this next release though :P \nI'll also try to track down that other issue to see if there was another objection I had that I can't remember right now.\nEdit: I found it :)\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/271\nSo in addition to the concerns raised above there are the following considerations:\n- If the user is offline when they restart the browser, it will break the extension (you mention a workaround for this above)\n- I mention a performance cost to hosting externally. Although I'm not sure this is correct? Other than the initial suspension, it probably wouldn't consume any more resources than a local page. I guess I'd need to test it.\n- And I guess it's worth mentioning, it would involve a pretty major refactor. There's a lot of direct communication with suspended tabs via messaging that would have to be refactored. Probably into the content script. Which may increase the bloat of the extension.. For the record, here's somebody who seems to be using TGS as a way to restart chrome quickly: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/700. tbh, i think that running some js code from the console is probably the best way to handle this use case.\nthe people wanting to do this are generally fairly tech-savvy, and having this as part of the official build would only cause confusion.\nperhaps this issue is the best place for people to share their different methods for handling this.\nthoughts?. I've added a new debugging feature called 'tab claiming' which will allow you to revert any suspended tabs suspended by another version of the extension over to the current version of the extension (that is, the version running the debug page).\nThere is now also a handy link to the debug page in the about section of the extension options.\nDuplicate of #748 . Thanks for this.\nI'll try to fix this asap.. I have pushed a fix for this (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/40ce23f97562392355cfc6f30221dfe42a8deb77). @rperretta the extension cannot affect your system once you have uninstalled it. you are somehow reopening old urls that were created while the extension was installed.\nperhaps you have used another extension like session buddy to restore some tabs, and it has tried to restore tab that was suspended at the time (during the time you had the extension installed).\none solution is to reinstall the extension, then click 'unsuspend all' which will unsuspend all your tabs. then remove the extension again.\notherwise you can do as @fwextensions suggested.\n. @wildfire2020 as you can see, there is some activity here, usually not by me, but by some other active github users.\nif you're worried about installing the extension, my best advice is to install another extension called session buddy at the same time which will allow you to back up and restore your tabs sessions.\nbut as long as you ensure you unsuspend all your tabs before uninstalling the extension (should you wish to) you should be fine.. This is probably a bit niche for the general populace so I won't be adding it as an explicit option.\nHowever, I could look into a way of queuing the tabs for unsuspension so they don't all try to unsuspend simultaneously.\nThis would be good not just for the 503 issue, but for general performance.. For the latest information on the date of the new release see this issue: \nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537\nAs for v7.3.0. I assume that must be a locally installed version? There was possibly a brief period where I may have mistakenly committed a bad version number. Perhaps your clone of the repo coincided with that? \nIf you are using a locally installed version, I would suggest unsuspending (or saving) all your tabs, and then updating to the latest version from this repo.\nIf you are using the webstore version, sit tight. A new update is coming very shortly.. See this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/97. Similar but probably different issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/619. Thanks for the contribution.\nI've discussed this PR a fair bit with @liamjohnston and we've decided not to go ahead with it sorry.\nThe theme option was introduced for practical reasons (for going easy on the eyes when browsing in low light conditions). I don't really want to go down the path of multiple themes for purely aesthetic reasons.\nSo I've reviewed this PR as if it were a suggested replacement for the current dark theme. \nThere is a few things you've done that I like. The slightly blacker background. The multiple shades used in the snoozy image. And the dimming of the screen shot (and brightening on hover).\nWe have taken those ideas and incorporated them into the current dark theme.\nOnce again, thanks for your contribution.. Something similar has already been requested: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/136\nAlthough I suspect you are asking for the opposite of this. Instead of suspending the oldest tab when you open a new one, you want to keep the oldest tabs unsuspended.\nI think this is fundamentally opposed to how The Great Suspender works. It automatically suspends tabs that haven't been accessed for a long time. These are precisely the tabs you are proposing to keep unsuspended.\nYou may also be interested in another feature that is already implemented: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/228\nThis allows you to right-click on a link and choose 'open link in new suspended tab'.\nAlternatively, there is another feature request to force ALL tabs opened in a new tab to be suspended automatically (not implemented): https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/655. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/256. This is possible resolved with this PR: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/623\nComing soon in the new release.. @vctrlt From memory, I have tried this and it's as @fwextensions said, the tabs do not get suspended before chrome closes.\nThe upcoming release has a new keyboard shortcut called 'Force suspend all tabs in all windows' (also available via the right-click context menu).\nThis will reduce your actions down to 1 before closing (as it also suspends the currently active window).. From this duplicate issue: #538 @H0R1Z0N suggests using the 'resuspend all' option on a previous session for the extensions session management. screen.\nAlso, here is a relevant chromium bug report on trying to detect chrome shutdown events: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30885. @DAOWAce hmmm v7.3.0 is odd. you're the second person to report being on that version, but in theory the latest version is only at v7.0.95 :D \nperhaps you cloned the repo after a bad commit. anyway, I hope the latest dark theme colour is to your tastes. . @JonnyRedHed @liamjohnston i have made this into it's own issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/727. I'm sorry. I am unable to reproduce this.\nUnsuspending that tab starts the audio playing again no problem.. Thanks a lot for this!. Just to be clear, you're saying that you WANT these tabs to suspend, even though they have form input?\nIf so, then I assume it's because these webpages are constantly auto-saving user input, and therefore are not affected by tab suspension.\nCan you confirm this is indeed what you are requesting?. Yes, it's almost like we need an internal blacklist of websites that have their own auto-saving of form inputs.\nHere is a related issue. It suggests 'clearing' the form input status once the form/email is submitted which might help alleviate your issue:\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/654. Can everyone please let me know the operating system they are using?\nI cannot replicate on OSX high sierra with chrome v70.0.3514.2. \nHave also tried a debian virtual machine with no luck (it think it was on a recent chrome beta build).. @hmnd @CollinChaffin @xeon927 @matznerd can one (or more) of you please send me a screenshot of what this looks like? ie: what does the chrome window look like when it steals focus?\nand to further clarify the exact steps to reproduce here:\n1. set time to suspend to 20 seconds\n2. open a new tab to google.com\n3. open a second tab (to lose focus on the google.com tab)\n4. open a different application on the operating system (to lose focus on the chrome app)\n5. wait 20 seconds for google.com tab to suspend\n6. chrome application gains focus and pops something up on the screen?? (or just flashes in the taskbar in the case of windows).\n. @hmnd and to confirm, when you have this happen on windows (albeit just the icon flashing), it's with windows 10 and chrome canary v70.0.3525.0 ? \nThis is exactly my test scenario and I cannot reproduce :(\nand have you tried with a different chrome profile? what if you create a new profile and only install this one extension (that being the dev build of TGS).\n. I guess this is a duplicate of: #865  ?\nShould be resolved now.. @Protonus \nIn regards to the session management feature. Yes, it is very similar to session buddy. Although if you really want a decent session manager, I would recommend using session buddy over the great suspender. The session management feature was mainly developed to help users recover lost tabs during an extension update.\nFor the tab discarding, it is in chrome stable now. But only gets activated by chrome under severe memory pressure. In that way it operates differently to TGS. Even with tab discarding, chrome will happily eat up 8GB of ram, so long as it's available to be consumed.\nI actually have another extension called The Great Discarder, which uses the native chrome discarding instead of the suspending that TGS uses. You might want to try that? Although it's not maintained like TGS is.\nAnd actually, in the upcoming release, I have actually made some hidden flags that will allow you to use tab discarding in TGS instead of tab suspension. This will not be available from the general options screen though. It can only be accessed from the debug screen.\nAs for the memory / performance issues you're encountering, perhaps it would be best to create a seperate gitHub issue for this.\nAlternatively, here is a generic issue I created where people can post their memory usage stats: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/613\n. That looks like a bug. Try checking and unchecking the 'context menu' extension option again to see if this fixes it.\nThere have also been some improvements to the functionality of the context menu in the upcoming release.. ok :(\nwell i think the next step is to wait to see if the new release fixes the issue.. @pruchkin2 can you please let me know the version of the extension you're using?\nIs it happening on every single suspended page?\nWhat happens after a chrome restart?. Even though I cannot reproduce, I will assume that this issue will be made redundant by the upcoming release v7.x. I can't seem to replicate this. Can you please paste the following urls for me?\n- The url of the youtube tab before you suspend it.\n- The url of the suspended youtube tab.\n- The url of the youtube tab AFTER you unsuspend it.\nIs it possible that it's related to another extension? What if you try this in incognito mode? Or on another chrome profile that only has TGS installed?. Will close this. But please add another comment if the issue arises again.. @danpottshimself That must be some internal chrome caching. Unsuspending a tab actually just calls window.location.replace(<original-url>) on the suspended tab.\nSo it's probable that it's a chrome / youtube issue. But the extension highlights the problem by causing the tab to reload from chrome cache more often than it would normally?. @kankaristo thanks a lot for catching this!\n. @Benny1988 can you give me a bit more information? \nThis tab should only ever show once the first time the extension is installed. Are you saying that every time a user starts their chrome this page pops up? Or only the first time they install the extension?\nIs it possible that you have some strange configuration that prevents chrome from saving local settings?. Ah ok. I will refer you to this issue then (still unresolved): https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/97\nShould this be implemented, you should be able to set a flag to let the extension know it is not the first time it is being installed.. Fixed by chromium team :). Yes. Screen captures of pdfs is not currently supported. However, this feature is coming.\nPlease refer to this duplicate issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/62. @fwextensions sorry if i've already asked you this, but you're saying the icons stay like this permanently?\nBecause it happens to me exactly the same, except that eventually they update to the proper icons. It maybe takes up to 2 minutes, depending on how many tabs I have open.\nAlso, that screenshot is from an older version. Have you tried the most recent update?\n. The fact that the favicon updates when it gains focus definitely confirms it's an issue with the javascript on the suspended tab not being run in the background. But is allowed to run once it gains focus. Although it's interesting that the title does update as this is also set via the same javascript. Perhaps the title is cached somehow.\nYour theory about discarded tabs sounds mostly correct. I don't think that the discarded state of a tab before chrome is closed carries over to a restart, although it is highly likely that when restarting chrome under heavy memory pressure, some tabs are discarded before they have a chance to load. \nOn a related note, the latest version has a new feature which detects tab discarding, and instead suspends the tab. Although perhaps during startup, the discarding is happening before the extension has a chance to load and run the detection code.\nYour idea about checking for discarded tabs after launch is a good lead. I'll have a play around and see what I can do. Although first I'll need to be able to reliably reproduce the issue :/ \nPerhaps a virtual machine with low memory will work.. @fwextensions thanks for pointing out the bug with the \"suspend instantly when memory is low\" option if you have \"time to suspend\" set to never. when tabs are discarded in this situation it should not suspend the tab, as i don't want this feature to appear like a bug (ie. the never suspend option appears to not work).\ni have also remove the logging of the tab url. although it may still appear as part of the change info object. in your logs these objects appear simply as 'object' which is unfortunate, as it makes it harder to debug. i'm not sure why your log prints like this? in mine it shows a serialised version of these objects.\ninvestigating now why some of your tabs seem to be calling chrome.tabs.onUpdated so frequently..\n. I have managed to recreate this issue (by discarded on tabs on extension start) before doing the extension initialisation. I have committed some new code to force any suspended tabs that get discarded during startup to undiscard themselves. Hopefully this doesn't cause any performance issues (given that the tabs are only being discarded due to low memory).\nThanks for all your help with this one @fwextensions . @fwextensions my experience with copy/pasting in the logs is that the objects get properly serialized when you paste them into a text document. who knows why this does not happen with you.\nas for the favicons. the favicon defined in suspended.html is the blockhead icon. therefore, when chrome navigates to that url, it will always show this icon first. it has nothing to do with whether the 'proper' favicon for the original site exists or is transparent etc.\nas you pointed out, the swapping of the blockhead favicon for the 'proper' one happens in the javascript. if the tab is discarded before this javascript can run, then the favicon never gets updated. \nthe real problem is, once a tab is discarded, it is completely unreachable. it will not accept message requests. it does not even get returned with chrome.extension.getViews() which is supposed to return every open tab owned by the extension (which should be all suspended tabs).\nthe only way i can see to run that javascript is by reloading the tab (which is actually just the equivalent of suspending it, so it's not that bad).\nalso, this code is only run during extension initialisation. and it runs in such a way that the checking for discarded suspended tabs is staggered. so the tab will stay discarded for a few seconds at least, giving chrome it's wish of freeing up system resources when it needs them.\nthe one caveat to this however, is that you may still encounter the blockhead favicon issue if restoring a lot of suspended tabs outside of chrome restart. ie: restoring a lot of suspended tabs via a session manager.\n. @fwextensions Thanks a lot for your report. Sorry about the scare, but thanks to your detailed account, I can confirm that it was indeed due to pulling master without restarting the extension.\nthe latest version (7.0.155) has done away with the suspended.js file completely, which is what all the older versions relied on to load the suspended tab.\ni'm assuming that what happened to you will not happen to production users, given that an extension restart is forced when the code updates.\nlet me know if you encounter any more favicon issues. and i'm glad your tabs recovered correctly! you should also have a saved session that accompanies any new version update. . @samboa86 can you please let me know the version of the extension you were using when you encountered the blockhead icon? and do you still have the same issue on the latest development version here on gitHub?. tbh, i have written off bookmarks as a way of saving sessions. my figuring is that if someone has so many tabs open that they need The Great Suspender, then they probably aren't using bookmarks :P \ni actually have another extension called spaces which i use as an alternative to bookmarks: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spaces/cenkmofngpohdnkbjdpilgpmbiiljjim?hl=en\nbut i'm aware not everyone else feels the same way. i agree it would be nice to be able to bookmark the real url. it would also be nice if the real url appeared in chrome history and syncing.\nsee this issue for a similar discussion: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/46. Thanks a lot! Sorry for the bad translations :D . @stuartherbert can you give a bit more info? specifically:\n1. approximately how many tabs have you got open in your chrome?\n2. are these tabs mostly suspended, mostly unsuspended, or a mix of both?\n3. is this happening on chrome start only? what if you wait 5 minutes. does the cpu usage die down?\nthanks for the feedback. i'm looking into this now.. I have managed to recreate this \ud83c\udf89 \nI just hope that the issue on my end is due to the same thing as yours.\nI'm working on a hotfix now.. @stuartherbert the fix for this issue has been pushed to the webstore. unfortunately, do get to this version you may need to uninstall and reinstall the webstore version. either that, or wait another few days until this fix is rolled out to everyone (it's currently only targetting 5% of users, so the chances are pretty low that that will include you).\nif you do uninstall/reinstall, just remember to unsuspend or backup all your tabs first!. You may be correct about this. I didn't foresee this being triggered that often, but you've helped me realise this may seem like a bug to a lot of users.\nWhat it is really doing is detecting when chrome uses its native 'discarding' and instead suspending the tab. \nThe reason for this is that discarded tabs cannot be manipulated with the extension, so I was trying to avoid another apparent bug which is that tabs that should suspend would not due to having been discarded first.\nAn easy fix would be to check the whitelist status of the tab first, and allowing whitelisted tabs to discard but not suspend. I'll try to implement this as a hotfix.. I think you're probably encountering this bug actually: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/722\nIt's being worked on right now. Sorry about this... @fwextensions are you still CPU issues on the latest master? all known bugs have now been fixed.. @fwextensions there's a lot to unpack here.\nfirstly, to simplify things i'd like to leave complications due to using multiple versions of the extension off the table. \ni'd also just like to clarify regarding the 2 different issues raised in this github ticket. \n1. whitelisted tabs being suspended was indeed fixed with the change from forceTabSuspension() to queueTabForSuspension().  The former will force suspension of a page regardless of it's whitelist/etc state, whereas the latter will respect all the 'never suspend' options.\n2. for the excessive cpu usage, that was a different issue (#722) and was resolved by simplifying the dom and css of a suspended tab. the fix for this was wrapped up in the same update as the above issue.\ni'm not sure where you read that processRequestTabSuspensionQueue() will try to suspend 20 tabs per second? it should only request a new tab suspend itself after the queue length (of tabs currently suspending) is less that MAX_TABS_IN_PROGRESS which should be 5 if screen capture mode is off and 3 if it is enabled.\nso in fact, most of the seconds it does not queue any new tabs for suspension. only when one of the previous ones has finished suspending.\nin regards to checkTabsForResponsiveness on suspended tabs. i'd rather that every tab, suspended or not, remains responsive to queries from the background script. there's a few features that rely on this communication, and it would appear buggy if some tabs did not behave the same as the rest (just look at the message listener of a suspended tab to see what is possible). \nsorry if i haven't covered everything in your posts. i've got some other things to look into so need to be somewhat frugal with my time :)\nbut thanks for your significant contributions to this project. it's really appreciated.. @AlexWayfer @alidan  \nthanks for the feedback. a couple of counterpoints.\n\n\ni feel like part of your problems are due to your massive screen resolution. i've attached a screenshot of what it looks like for me.\n\n\nthe favicon is rendered at original size. if i try to increase that it's going to start looking bad.\n\n\nfor the background colour, it's a good point about it looking like a chrome error tab. an alternative for you might be to use the night theme?\n\n\ni'm not 100% sure i understand what you mean about needing a section to focus a window? for me, if i click anywhere on a suspended tab on a window that is NOT in the foreground, it does not action an unsuspend. also, the reason i made the top area clickable for unsuspension was for reasons communicated in this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/180\ni actually found myself having this problem too. where i would want to unsuspend a tab with the mouse but would end up clicking on the top bar and nothing would happen.\n\n\ni'm still open to ideas, especially for handling users such as yourself with large screen resolutions. let me know what you think about my comments above.\n\n. Possible redesign: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/tree/hotfix/suspended-tab-redesign. For the ongoing discussion on whether to make the topbar unclickable, please refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/741\nI will close this as being mostly implmented with the redesign PR.\nIf you have any other (unimplemented) design requests, please create a new issue for them.. @uhuhleuh hmmm.. while i agree it would be nice to be able to distinguish easily between different chrome profiles, i feel like that's a bit out of scope of this extensions purpose.\nfor most users that would just come across as, \"you can customise the background colour of your suspended tab page\" which is not something i really want people to be able to do (because I don't like custom theming in general).. And while we're talking about text wrapping on the popup menu, here's the russian version (on OSX)\n\n. Popup has been themed for night mode now (#790).\nAlso see this subsequent commit (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/dd391fecb225bd554e20193ae5a8b8621e675971)\nWill leave this issue open for the other screens (ie. options). I've been swamped with moving to a new country. Giving it another regression test over the next week. Fingers crossed.. Best to follow the milestone: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/milestone/1\nI'll post any updates there. There's currently 3 open issues.. Hmmm.. yes sorry. I thought it didn't make sense to have 2 seperate hotkeys for this. So I removed the unsuspend hotkey and turned the suspend hotkey into a toggle.\nUnfortunately, I think your situation might be the edge case.\nYou could try cmd+R for refresh which will also unsuspend - although you probably don't want to refresh if the page is already unsuspended?\nSorry about that.. @ghgcsilva sorry for the bad experience you're having :(\nfirst of all, the new release comes with the ability to warn users of an impending update and prompts for users to backup tabs before updating. unfortunately this functionality wasn't programmed into the version you were upgrading from.\nthe memory leak is worrying. can i get an idea of how many suspended tabs you're dealing with? and is this happening immediately after a chrome restart, or just in general usage? \ncan you be more specific about the behaviour of the GPU process? perhaps a screen shot?\nfor me it seems pretty stable. \nwould love to get to the bottom of the issue if i can reproduce it.. @mkrier it's situations like this that have made me so hesitant to push an update to this extension over the past year.\nyou're not the only one to have issues with lost tabs (there's a github issue dedicated to this: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526) and while i realise that's cold comfort, please know that the decision to update has weighed heavily on my mind and i've done everything i can to mitigate casualties.\nprior to this i've had a 'no updates' policy, but due to a critical bug (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537) of which i have had a lot of pressure to resolve, i resolved to break away from this policy.\nthe ability to warn users of an impending update has been added to this latest release. that mean in future you'll be warned before it updates, and given a chance to make a real 'hard' backup of your tabs. \ni think you'll find you cannot turn off automatic updates of chrome extensions. if you truly want to protect yourself against a similar issue in future, your best bet is to install the extension locally from the source code here on gitHub. that will prevent the extension from updating automatically in future.\nthank you for donating in the past. and i'm sorry i've caused you problems with lost tabs :(. @mkrier Someone else on twitter has actually reported a similar issue to you where the tabs that got restored after the update were from an older period in time.\ni wonder, could you let me know what your session history page looks like? is there a 'Automatic save point for v7.1.109' entry?\nDoes this entry match with the incorrect tabs you saw being restored?\nAnd under 'recent sessions' does this same session match the most recent session recorded before the update? Or is there other more recent sessions recorded there, prior to the update that might contain the missing tabs you are looking for?\nany help that you can provide that would help me get to the bottom of this would be most appreciated.. @mkrier unfortunately, you will not be able to refuse a new update. this is chrome's policy not mine. i think this is to force users to stay up to date for security reasons (they should not be able to refuse security patches). the only way to remain on an old version of an extension is to install it manually via developer mode.\nthat's interesting about session buddy. i have actually noticed that it was no longer saving recent backups which was also my primary use-case for it. funnily, i had already switched to Tabs Backup & Restore a few days ago, following a suggestion in another issue. \nI guess I'm slightly hesitant to recommend an alternative session manager extension as it may come with it's own issues that I haven't encountered yet. Although perhaps I should also remove any recommendations of Session Buddy too.\nYou're welcome to create a post for Tabs Backup & Restore. It seems to work great for me so far, even with restoring. . @mopquill can i just clarify with you some things. did you actually lose any tabs permanently after the update? or was it just that some of them disappeared and then came back?\nDuring an update all suspended tabs will be closed automatically. Afterwards the extension will try to reload them all again automatically based on what it remembers you had open before updating.\nI agree this is a very jarring experience, and that is why I have tried to limit extension updates in the past. However, its unfortunately unavoidable, and considered normal behaviour.\nFrom what I can tell, the other two posters in this thread are reporting that the tabs did not correctly get reloaded after update. Or more specifically, the tabs that were reloaded were not the same ones that were recently lost.. @Anyasia If you look in Session Manager, there should always be a single entry under \"Current session\". This session gets updated any time a tab is added, removed, or its url changes. Whenever the extension restarts (which usually only happens during a chrome restart), whatever was in \"Current session\" gets moved to the top of \"Recent sessions\", and a new \"Current session\" is started with the currently open tabs.\nI would hope that you can rely on this functionality in future. \nI've been able to identify an issue that could cause the v6.30 restore point to be slightly out of date. But I can't see any issue so far that could cause the current session to not update properly. I'll keep looking.. @mopquill thanks for the detailed response. When you say \"you used your most recent recovery to get them back\", and also later on \"was able to get most of my tabs back via looking through some past sessions\".\nWhat are these recovery/sessions you're referring to? Do you mean sessions in the TGS session manager? If so, were they saved sessions or recent sessions? There seems to be a fair proportion of people that run into this bug due to all their TGS sessions being lost (#659 and here). In these instances there is no way to recover via the TGS session manager, and the cause is clear as to why their tabs were lost (there was no previous session to restore them from).\nIn your case, did/do you still have your recent sessions? If so, was the most recent session an old one that didn't include your most recent browsing activity (as of the moment when you updated) ?\n. yes. this was an interesting process for me. i found that by activating unsuspend on click, it meant that if i drag selected the text of the title and released the mouse outside of the title container, it would trigger an onclick event of the element where the mouse was released.\nto prevent this, i used the mousedown position of the click to determine whether the tab should unsuspend.\nto clarify your issue, i dont think it will unsuspend when you copy the title of the page by drag-selecting. this was specifically what i was designing to allow for. although you have a point about trying to do the same for the url portion. i didn't think to test that.\nfor me, the logical thing to do with the url is to right-click and then select 'copy link address'. this does not cause a page reload, and it also copies the real url (including query params) whereas the display text url is just the base url.. Ah yes. That is unfortunate about starting your click outside of the text.\nI think the main thing here is that using onmousedown is just a bit strange in general and i should probably look at changing it in future.\nFor the URL, yes, it's not drag selectable at all. As mentioned above, it's not something i thought to test as i always used right-click on the url portion.. Related issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/741. I have improved the click behaviour of suspended tabs.\nYou can click-drag on the url without it unsuspending.\nThe only onmousedown handler now is on the area of the topbar that does not have text. . @alidan this is something i have spent considerable time researching.\nin the release you have just received i have implemented exactly what you have requested. unfortunately, the version you were upgrading from did not have this code already.\nin future (in best case scenario) the extension will warn you before it updates, and prompt you to back up your tabs in preparation.\ndue to the way the extension works, when it updates it kills all open tabs owned by that extension. this means every suspended tab. \nwhen the extension reloads, it looks for tabs that were suspended in the previous session and restores them in a SUSPENDED state. \nunder no circumstances does the extension open a tab to an unsuspended url. this sounds like something that chrome would do on a chrome restart, when it tries to 'continue where you left off'.\nfrom my experience, restoring even 500 suspended tabs should not take much more than 5 minutes. whereas 500 UNSUSPENDED tabs could well take an indefinite period of time. \nmy best guess as to what happened to you (and i could well be wrong) is that you actually did have all these tabs unsuspended, and for some reason your chrome was restarted (possibly due to a crash caused by the extension update?), and when it restarted chrome tried to restore all your tabs as they were before the crash based on the 'continue from where you left off' policy.\nlet me know if this sounds feasible. if there's a bug in the extension update process i'd love to get to the bottom of it.. @alidan just curious, do you have the screencapture option turned on? this makes suspending tabs MUCH slower. if not, i've found it's pretty speedy at suspending large numbers of tabs. the new version queues up the tabs to be suspended so that it only tries to do at most 5 at a time to prevent huge CPU load. \nwhen you say 'the problem with loading tabs suspended has been around for a while', what do you mean exactly? when you 'load the program one window at a time', do you mean that you somehow restore windows from a session manager? and when you do, do those restored tabs get loaded as suspended or unsuspended? what session manager are you using to do this 'one window at a time' restoring?. I've had a similar thought. Although on last check (two days ago) it passed my sniff test.\nWill keep this on the table for possible consideration in the future @liamjohnston . @SnIPeRSnIPeR i'm sorry, i don't fully understand what is happening for you. can you open a separate issue and explain in detail what you are experiencing?\n@Harmon758 i am still investigating your issue of 'Suspend this tab now' intermittently not working from the popup menu. As you can imagine, it's not the easiest thing to test. Although anecdotally, i feel like i've experienced this myself once or twice.. @Harmon758 @roastchicken @SnIPeRSnIPeR if any of you are running a development version of the extension, i have just pushed an optimistic fix for this issue (v7.125).\nLet me know if the problem seems to be resolved.\nFYI, it was potentially caused by some code that cancels a suspend tab request if the tab being suspended somehow regains focus before the suspension finishes.\nIt's possible that this is somehow happening due to the popup menu opening and closing.. This was removed intentionally as i don't feel like I should be showing this kind of information in incognito mode. People use that mode primarily for privacy, and i thought the extension should respect this. For those that are not aware of the session management features of the extension, they may be shocked to know that it is recording their incognito session history.\nCan I recommend that you use a separate session management extension for this purpose? Perhaps session buddy or Tabs Backup & Restore.. Do you mean that the extension only updates on one computer? Or only on one profile?\nIf you have multiple computers all logged into the same chrome profile, do they not all update to the same version?\nAs for forcing the update, if you go to chrome://extensions/ you should see an 'update' button at the top which should force all extensions to update if there is a new version available.. Actually, the 'suspend all tabs in all windows' option will actually force all tabs, whitelisted or not, to suspend.\nIt's not well documented sorry, and a bit odd i'll admit that it happens on this option and not the 'suspend other' option.\nDoes this help you?. Ok, that's for the feedback. I've updated the title of the issue to suggest this should be made into a preference.. @retrospec13 can you give me an idea of what you're after ideally?\nit's just a bit of a grey area for me. i can understand you might expect whitelisted tabs to be included in the 'suspend all other tabs' action. and probably pinned tabs also (even with the option to never suspend pinned tabs turned on).\nbut what about tabs that have been temporarily paused? and tabs that are currently receiving form input?. @retrospec13 sorry, that comment above was for you. thanks for working that out :)\nfirst of all, just to clarify, when you talking about 'closing' tabs, i assume you mean suspending? there was never any option to close tabs automatically, so i assume i'm correct with this assumption.\nand second clarification, we are only talking about the 'suspend all other tabs' option from the popup menu. NOT the 'force suspend all tabs in all windows' option in the right-click context menu.\nso, assuming the two things above, i can confirm that this latest release has changed the behaviour of the 'suspend all other tabs' action, so that it will now only affects tabs that would have automatically suspended anyway (ie. not whitelisted tabs, or pinned tabs if the 'never suspend pinned tabs' option is checked).\nin effect, the 'suspend all other tabs' action just fast forwards the timer on all tabs and make those that would have suspended eventually, suspend right away. those that would not have suspended are not affected.\nmy question to you is how you would like this to change. you've already stated that you'd like it to suspended whitelisted tabs. and you've also stated that you DON'T want the currently focused tab to suspend.\ni would like to know what you expect to happen to some of the other tabs. like:\n- tabs that have unsaved form input\n- tabs that you have specifically requested not to suspend by choosing the 'not now' link in the popup.. I'm unsure why you keep using the word 'closed'? That implies the tab will disappear which is never what this extension has done or (i think) should do.\nOnce again, I'm going to assume you mean 'Force all tabs to suspend in this window' (except currently focused tab).\nSo that really just brings us back to my earlier two questions. And it seems that yes, you'd like tabs with unsaved form input to suspend, even if that means losing whatever you've typed in there.\nAnd I'm going to assume that you would also expect tabs that you've explicitly asked to not suspend (via the 'not now' option in the popup menu) to also suspend.\nMy personal thoughts on this:\nI don't think this is different enough from the current 'suspend all other tabs' option to warrant an additional option in the popup menu.\nI think at the very least, the current option needs to be reworded slightly to be more clear as to exactly what it does.\nAnd possibly we could add an addition option to configure how this action works.\nAn alternative approach could be to have just a single action for suspending multiple tabs, and then it prompts you for whether you'd like included tabs with unsaved form inputs, paused tabs, and which windows to target.\n. @peterlaws there is no good reason why this is only in the context menu. i guess perhaps i just thought it probably wasn't used very often and didn't want it to clutter up the popup menu. i'm open to perhaps add this in? but not sure as it has the potential to suspend tabs with unsaved form input and i dont want users to accidentally click this..\n@kankaristo that's an interesting point about selected tabs. i hadn't realised it prevents whitelisted selected tabs from suspending. that really doesn't make sense. in this case it really should force all selected tabs to suspend, even ones with unsaved form input (in my opinion).\ni'm still on the fence about the 'all other tabs' option. it's worth noting that it used to behave exactly as you are requesting (it would force suspend all other tabs in the window regardless of the 'never suspend' settings). however, there were multiple bug reports about this which seemed to indicate that that behaviour was unintuitive. see:\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/553\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/329\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/437\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/567\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/462\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/329\nthe large number of these raised issues makes me very hesitant to revert this behaviour. however, most of these issues are people wanting the 'pinned tabs' option respected. but i think this holds equally as true for whitelisting.\nperhaps @kankaristo's suggestion of using suspend selected tabs (and changing it to force suspend) would be an adequate workaround for the minority of people who want to also suspend whitelisted/pinned tabs?\nalternatively, i would consider adding an extra option 'force suspend all tabs in this window' to the right-click context menu. @peterlaws once again, not putting this in the popup menu :/\nthoughts everybody?. @retrospec13 i'm hesitant because i'm unsure how many people have a need for these actions. if it's only a few, then omitting them from the popup menu provides a better user experience for the majority of users (due to a cleaner, more comprehendible menu).\nit's the same reason we have omitted the \" in this window\" text as well (ie: instead of \"suspend all other tabs in this window\").. @kankaristo \n\nAnother option would be to have \"Suspend all other tabs\" to work the way it does now (whitelisted and paused tabs wouldn't suspend), and \"Suspend selected tabs\" would force suspend all selected tabs (ignoring the whitelist and paused tabs). That way you could just select all tabs in the window and suspend them, no need to toggle settings. But the wording should probably be changed to \"Force suspend selected tabs\" to avoid confusion.\n\nI just looked into this, and \"Suspend selected tabs\" already does ignore whitelist etc. I've tested it, and this does look like it is currently a viable workaround for suspending those tabs that do not get triggered with the 'suspend all other tabs' action.. @retrospec13 if you select multiple tabs in chrome (by holding down shift and then clicking another tab) then two extra items will appear in the extension popup menu given you the option to suspend / unsuspend all the selected tabs.\nin the most recent dev version, these options have been permanently added to the right-click menu and also available as keyboard shortcuts.\nAlso, in this latest dev version, there is an option in the right-click menu (and keyboard shortcut) to force suspend all tabs in the active window.\nHere's a screenshot :)\n\n. @retrospec13 dev version will be released very shortly. can you please elaborate on what suggestion is not working? I have tested and if you select multiple tabs (via shift click) then chose 'suspend selected tabs' from the popup menu, it DOES override whitelisted urls (ie: it suspends all selected tabs).\nDoes this not work for you?. @Anyasia as you assumed, it was an intentional change. although i'm pretty sure that same behaviour existed in the previous release also.\nrather than rely on a trick of quickly visiting a bunch of tabs, i'd rather implement a more obvious way for users to achieve the same task.\nwould an option to be able to pause the extension be what you're looking for? this is already a feature request which i am considering: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/256\neither that, or just extending the time to suspend might help you? . @saurabhgayali @SnIPeRSnIPeR can you guys confirm whether the new 'Sync settings between different systems' option is turned off or on? And also whether you have manually changed this setting?\n@saurabhgayali during testing i had no problem with the whitelist during update. also, the next update will warn you before it updates, giving you a change to backup your suspended tabs. for the whitelist, you could easily back that up just by saving a copy of the text manually, or if you do enable options synching, then it will be automatically backed up to your chrome profile.. @SnIPeRSnIPeR @saurabhgayali \nthe reason i ask about the settings sync option is because there is some special behaviour around whether that is on or off. \npeople upgrading from an older version should have that setting defaulting to OFF. so it's weird that it's ON for @SnIPeRSnIPeR if you haven't touched it.\nif you install for the first time, then that setting should default to ON, and should prevent against loss of settings in the future.\nThe reason it defaults to OFF for existing users is to protect users that have different whitelists on different computers (but on the same chrome profile). As soon as you turn syncing on, it will overwrite the options of all other computers logged into the same chrome profile that also have the settings sync option on.\n@saurabhgayali could you tell me whether this option was ON or OFF for you?\nI would like to investigate whether there is an issue with the code that determines the above behaviour.. @cdick001 your issue sounds different. this issue is for people losing their whitelist. most probably you  are suffering from this other issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/723. My 2 cents. I have experienced the same issue as @mkrier.\nI think we just need to define what we are expecting from a session manager. For me, I expect it to be constantly recording the state of my tabs. If chrome crashes, I want it to have remembered my last known state. \n\nSession Buddy used to do this, but now no longer does. This for me makes it useless for my primary use case.\nThe Great Suspender does do this. It will update the most recent session whenever a url is changed or a tab is added/removed. However, we're talking about an external tool for when TGS fails so that's out in this instance.\nTabs Backup & Restore seems to do exactly what I want. It's a shame it's no longer maintained, but it still does exactly what I need, so personally i've switched to using this.\n\n. Closing this as it is already implemented (as @liamjohnston has demonstrated).. @DrGaellon As suggested, try disabling the 'Instantly suspend' option as see if this fixes the issue.\nAnd just to be sure, you're not by any chance clicking the 'open in new suspended tab' option in the right-click menu are you?. @ossilator I assume with this that you have the 'Never suspend active tab in each window' option unchecked. \nI suspect that very few people have this option unchecked (it's checked by default). So the potential target users for such a feature would be very small.. @fwextensions sorry about this. it was a bug in some code i recently committed.\nit should be fixed now.\nas for the use of strict matching, i've also updated the code in this specific instance to use strict matching. however, i have not touched the many other places in the code that use loose matching.\nperhaps the whole concept of loose matching should be removed from the extension, as it's really only to help users who use both the webstore version and a locally installed version.\ni'm not sure this should be catered for in the production code. however, i do find it useful. it means that a call to something like 'sendRefreshToAllSuspendedTabs' will be able to update all suspended tabs, regardless of which version of the extension made the suspension. \nit also helps out a lot if you want to load an old session from backup that has tabs suspended by a different version.\nkeen to hear your thoughts on this.. I hope you don't mind, I updated the title to reflect this new direction of the thread. . I've added a new debugging feature called 'tab claiming' which will allow you to revert any suspended tabs suspended by another version of the extension over to the current version of the extension (that is, the version running the debug page).\nThere is now also a handy link to the debug page in the about section of the extension options.. No sorry. There's a lot that you're asking for there. And I agree that some of those things would be great to have.\nI think that these features belong in a different extension to The Great Suspender. This extension is limited to increasing browser performance, not providing a fully featured session management tool.\nHowever, it does handle some of the things you've requested. Just not quite in the way you'd probably expect.\n\n\nNext/previous tab information for each tab: If you restore a session with the TGS session manager, it will not remember the tab history of each tab. Although I am working on another extension (Spaces) that will do this eventually.\n\n\nCurrent scroll position in each tab: TGS will remember the scroll position when it suspends a tab, and move back to that position when the tab is unsuspended. However, if you restore a session from the session manager, it will not remember scroll position when it reloads the tab.\n\n\nHalf filled forms inside of tabs: TGS allows you to prevent tabs that have half-filled forms from suspending. But if you close the tab or manually suspend it, it will lose that information. I'm not aware of any extension that provides the ability to restore form information. I feel like it would be a pretty tricky thing to get right for all the different kinds of websites out there. And also a slight privacy risk.\n\n\nPosition of tab within a window when you 'undo close' a tab: I'm not sure what you mean by this. The native chrome functionality works fine here. Are you suggesting that if you restore a session, it should also remember the closed tabs, and allow you to reopen them with Ctrl+Shift+T ? I can understand wanting to keep a record of closed tabs (once again, my other extension Spaces does this), but it doesn't make sense to me to be able to use Ctrl+Shift+T to reopen them, unless they were just closed in the current session (in which case chromes native functionality would work).\n\n\nHope that helps. Keen to hear your ideas as they are very similar to things I've thought about in the past and am trying to solve.. @neuhausneuhaus there is already an issue discussing alternative session managers: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/742\nThat is probably a good place to refer to.. If it can be fixed purely with css, without any extra code to handle the spinner then I'm all for it.\nI would rather head in the direction of simplicity if possible.\n. https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/750#issuecomment-418927149. This is currently not supported. There is an option to automatically unsuspend a tab when it gains focus. If you enable this, then when you close a tab, it will automatically unsuspend the newly focused tab. Perhaps this helps?. @Anthrwpos I've tested on Opera and I have no problem with the clickable area on a suspended tab.\nOpera version: 55.0.2994.56\nOS: OSX High Sierra 10.13.6\nHow did you install the extension on Opera? I did it via the 'install-chrome-extensions' opera addon: https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/\nWould be good to find out why it is not working for you. Are you familiar with debugging a website? If so, you could try inspecting the suspended tab page to find out why the click listeners are not firing for you.\nAlternatively, as a workaround, are you aware that refreshing the tab also unsuspends it? And the latest version also has a keyboard shortcut that both suspends (if unsuspended) and unsuspends (if suspended) the current tab.\nAs for reverting to an older version, there's not easy way sorry.. @Anthrwpos can you please take a screenshot of one of the pages that is not working for you? That might help me work out what the issue is.\nI have tried waiting over a day on opera with a suspended tab and it still unsuspends by clicking anywhere.\nAs for installing an older version, i came across this website which has archived all the older versions: https://crx.dam.io/ext/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg.html\nNOTE: You have to click on the 'view source' link for the version you want, and then click 'download' or 'crx' in the top right.\nNot sure how you'd go about installing the downloaded file on opera though. Perhaps do a google search for 'how to install crx on opera' or 'how to install opera extension from zip'.\nLet me know how you get on if you do end up installing an older version.. please refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537. When you say, \"TGS is used to save the open websites and restore them after restart.\" do you mean that you save the session with the TGS session management tool, and then once chrome has restarted, you restore the session via TGS again?\nIf i'm not correct in my assumptions above, then can you tell me what you have in chrome -> settings -> On start-up ?\nMost people use \"Continue where I left off\" which means that chrome will automatically restore the windows and tabs that were open when you last exited chrome.\nThis process is outside of the control of this extension.. Assuming that you are restoring tabs from the session manager, I'm still not sure that it is possible to implement what you are requesting without at least some manual work.\nThe way that windows shows items on the task bar is completely seperate from chrome, and there is no way for a chrome extension to access this information.\nChrome keeps it's own order of the windows, essentially ordered by 'first opened'. It is possible that i could create an interface for manually reordering windows in a saved session, but this would involve manual work and wouldn't be updated automatically when windows are rearranged in the windows task bar.. I'm still not entirely clear what behaviour you are looking for.\nYou said \"...so the windows open in the same order as they have been closed\". \nWhat do you mean by 'closed'? Why would you want to order windows by when they are closed?\nAnyway, it's possible there is a work around for you. On the latest version (v7.x) you can export a saved session. And you can also reimport this session. This allows you to change the order of the windows in the exported text file and reimport it. TGS should restore windows in the order they are specified in the text file (note: windows are separated by a single blank line). @CollinChaffin I'm unable to replicate this. Can you please confirm on the latest master code (v7.0.124).\nThanks.. @CollinChaffin Thanks for the detailed analysis. And sorry for the bad use of the negative wordings for the booleans. I agree it confuses things.\nHowever, I'm still unable to replicate this issue :(\nFirstly, you reference issue #791. I don't believe this is an active tab issue, you're correct that his active tab is the 4th (rightmost) tab, but the user is commenting on how the LEFTMOST tab (not active) is not suspending. Hence him saying that only 2 instead of 3 (out of the 4 tabs) are suspending.\nSecondly, while the wording in the code is confusing, i don't believe there is an error in logic there. IGNORE_ACTIVE_TABS and dontSuspendActiveTabs mean exactly the same thing. Ignore meaning, when looking for tabs to suspend, ignore (ie dont suspend) these (active) ones. When this is set to FALSE, active tabs ARE suspended, which is in keeping with having the 'Never suspend active tab in each window' option UNCHECKED.\nThere is a very definitive way to see if an active tab (in a non-active) window is going to suspend automatically. The TGS debug page will show the 'status' of each tab. If the tab has a status of 'active' then it will be ignored (ie. it will NOT suspend). If it has a status of 'normal' then it WILL automatically suspend.\nTry this experiment: Start a chrome session with just a single window and open two tabs, one for TGS settings, and one for TGS debug page. Then open a second window, navigate to any url and return to the first chrome window. If you refresh your debug page, you should see the tab in the other window appear in the debug tabs list. If you have the 'Never suspend active tab in each window' CHECKED, then this other tab should show a status of 'active' and have no time to suspend specified. If you then UNCHECK the 'Never suspend active tab in each window' option and refresh the debug page, you should now see that that tab in the other window has a status of 'normal' and it will have a time to suspend specified (depending on what you have set for your 'Automatically suspend tabs after' option.\nCan you try that and report back your findings? It seems to me that if you are experiencing the issue of active tabs (in non-active windows) never suspending, then the status of these active tabs will always read 'active' regardless of whether you check or uncheck the 'Never suspend active tab in each window' option.. @CollinChaffin I think I may know what is going on here. \nIt's possibly just a misunderstanding of what this feature is supposed to do. It is meant for users with multiple chrome WINDOWS open. Actually, ideally for users that have over 20+ windows which would mean it is able to suspend another 19+ extra tabs.\nUnchecking 'Never suspend active tab in each window' will allow the active tabs to suspend, but only for the NON-CURRENT windows. The active tab in the current window (the dev-tools window does not count as being the current window even if focused) will NEVER suspend, regardless of what you have set in your settings. This is because it is assumed that this is the tab the user is currently looking at.\nNote that this has nothing to do with whether chrome itself is currently focused in your window manager. Even if chrome is minimised, the currently active tab in the currently active window will never suspend automatically.\nWhen you click the extension popup menu for this tab, it says 'This tab will suspend automatically' but this actually means 'This tab will suspend automatically WHEN the tab is no longer the active tab in the window, or when this tab's window is no longer the currently focused window'.\nIn the debug log, when it says 'This tab is not eligible for suspension' it is because it is the currently focused tab in the currently focused window.\nThis is just the design decision I have decided upon with this feature. It COULD suspend this tab, but the cost to the system is just a single unsuspended tab at most, which is pretty minimal. The reason I implemented the 'active tab' feature at all is because I realised there were users that had 100+ different chrome WINDOWS open, and add this feature could allow them to suspend a significant number of extra tabs automatically.\nPlease let me know if I've identified your issue correctly. And let me know any thoughts you have on this.\nAnd thanks for the video. It always helps a lot when dealing with these confusing scenarios.. @CollinChaffin You have a legitimate point. I think the best way forward from here is to make a new gitHub issue as a feature request for the above, stating your case as to why you think it would be useful.\nThanks for all the feedback Collin.. @CollinChaffin This should be fixed in the latest master.\nThe promise rejection is expected. It is caused by attempting to send a message to the content script of a tab after the extension has been restarted. In this instance, the content script is no longer reachable. \nThis code is specifically there to test for this and reinject the content script if necessary.\nThe uncaught promise was a bug that has been fixed in the latest master.. @MartinDelille Thanks for the info on your project. It looks great.\nAt this point I've only just implemented Patreon support and will see how it goes for a while before I commit to anything else.\nOut of curiosity (and ignorance sorry) how do you differ from Patreon?. Please refer to these other issues:\nFor suspending tabs opened with 'open in new tab': https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/655\nFor suspending tabs on browser restart: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/49\nThe best you can do right now to achieve what you want it to set the 'Automatically suspend tabs after' option to 20 seconds.. Thanks so much for this! \ud83d\ude0d . Can you please provide a bit more information?\nFirstly, what version of the extension are you using?\nSecondly, can you please explain what you are doing when this happens?\nThat would be really useful in diagnosing your issue.\nSome questions:\n- WHEN does TGS open 2 or 3 sets of tabs? On chrome restart? Or when you try to restore a session from the TGS session manager?\n- Does 5x tabs mean 50 something tabs? Or 5 windows of tabs?\n- When you say 2 or 3 sets of them, do you mean the 50 something tabs get opened in 2 or 3 different identical windows?. @dashingassist can you also tell me what version of the extension you are using?\nand to double check your exact process:\n\nyou close each chrome window manually until there are no windows left.\nyou turn off your computer.\nyou turn your computer back on.\nyou reopen chome.\nyou see your startup tabs, as well as having (one?) extra window containing the tabs from the last window you closed the night before?\n\nat some point it seems you must actually close chrome (perhaps via the chrome menu?) or else it never really closes. can you let me know where in the above process you actually close chrome?. @CertaSolutions @dashingassist sorry about this guys.\ni've worked out what is going on. session recovery is being triggered for you even though you have chrome set to 'open a set of specific pages'. \nmy extension kindof assumes that everyone uses 'continue where i left off' :/\nanyway, i have pushed a fix for this now (v7.0.127). it will be included in the webstore version soon.. Please refer to this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/213\ntldr: it needs to run a content script on every active page.. Is it possibly the same thing as in this issue? https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/735\nFrom what I gather, this seems to be a very intermittent issue. If you are finding that it is a permanent problem, then perhaps your issue is different.\nCan you tell me how you are clicking 'suspend this tab now' ? From the popup menu, the right-click menu, or keyboard shortcut? Does it work via one method and not another?. @William6868 don't get sidetracked by #657. that's an old issue which is mostly fixed in the new release.\nI'm assuming that this happens on all tabs, not just a single specific url?\nAlso, I've pushed some code last night that may well fix your issue (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/c96bc078b1fd531829557fa703967619a9d4f7d7). The latest dev version (v7.0.125) contains this fix.. @William6868 hopefully within a week.. Thanks for replying to this @AtumVirt . This is most likely a duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/719\nShould be fixed in the new release!. Is it possible that chrome discarding is happening before your XX mins timeout?\nThere is also another option near the bottom called 'Instantly suspend when system memory gets very low '.\nIs this checked? If so, then tabs should automatically suspend if they get discarded BEFORE the time to suspend completes.. There is actually a debug screen you can access. Open the extension settings screen and then change the URL from options.html -> debug.html\nFrom here, you can enable info and/or error logging which will then be visible from the extension background page.\nAre you still having the issue of tabs not suspending on the latest development version (v7.0.129)?\nIf so, can you try these steps for me:\n1. Go to options and change 'Automatically suspend tabs after' to '20 seconds'. Also ensure that you have screen capturing disabled.\n2. Create a new tab and navigate to 'www.google.com' (ensure it is not whitelisted).\n3. Focus on a different tab in the same window and wait 20 seconds.\n4. Check to see if the other 'www.google.com' tab suspends automatically.\nThanks.\n. @CollinChaffin I've just re-seen this issue and realised it's probably the one you were referring to in issue #781 where you wrote:\n\n...since as of last night all had finally been fixed to at least show favicons EXCEPT in the most important one - the automatic \"wait 15 min\" suspend which is STILL broken. I also shot a video of that over in issue 478 (several, actually) to back up what others had already reported.\n\nI can't see any video depicting this issue over in 478 however. And I also notice I had already provided you with instructions for enabling logging here above. Perhaps you missed it ;)\nI'll copy and paste my relevant comments from 781 here for consistency:\n\nYou mentioned that you would report back with results but seeing as you haven't i assumed the issue was resolved. It's odd that you specifically mention 15 minute auto-suspend. I would have thought that it was equally as likely to occur with any time period. I use the 20sec timer when testing this stuff and haven't had any issues with the favicons on automatic suspend so far. Once again though, if you can replicate this, a recording of the log during the issue would be super useful, especially if you can identify the tab id that is causing issues, as all log entries report their tab id to help follow the process flow for each tab.. @goldenmane not sure what's going on there sorry. but i would recommend updating (or waiting) for the new version. \na lot has changed and there's not much point in investigating an issue like this on an older version.. @mkz7 can you please tell me what version of the extension you are using?\nalso, do the tabs show the correct favicon, or is it the default extension icon?\nCould it perhaps be the same issue as reported here? https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/719. @mkz7 Thanks, that's super useful information. I gave you the wrong issue number sorry. #478 is probably more like what you are experiencing (see further down the thread).\n\nI'll investigate the low-memory condition to see if I can replicate on v7.0.109.\nI've made a couple of changes since that version which will potentially fix your issue.\nAnd I'll close this thread as a duplicate of #478. This is an odd one. I've never seen this happen on any version (either reverse ordered OR randomly ordered).\nHowever, looking at the code, it IS conceivably possible for it to happen.\nI have pushed some optimistic changes to try to ensure that tab order is preserved upon session restore.\nLet me know if you still have issues on v7.0.129. This was a bug recently which I had thought I'd fixed. Could you please let me know two things.\n1. What version of the extension are you using when you see this behaviour?\n2. What do you have set under chrome settings -> on start up?\nCan you also please try the latest release and let me know if this is still happening (v7.0.129)?\nEven if it seems to be fixed in the latest release, it would still be great to know the answers to the two questions above. \nFYI: It's closely related to this bug: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/768\nThanks.. @CollinChaffin actually, a video would be great, as it's hard to picture the exact flow of what is happening to you.\nIf you could make a video that shows the session BEFORE closing chrome, and then the entire chrome restart process ensuring that the bug you've described is also visible.\nAnd secondly, if you could let me know what you have set under chrome settings -> on start up, that would be super helpful.\nThanks!. @CollinChaffin Hi Collin, and sorry for any extra digging i've asked you to do on some of the issues you've posted. Thanks heaps for getting back to me with more details. It's invaluable having people on the frontline testing out the latest development version of the code.\nHere's some answers to your questions:\n\nThis continues to happen I can shoot a video but here is what the video is I cannot understand how on earth this is \"difficult to picture\":\n\nThe video request is a last ditch effort to try and get to the bottom of what is happening here. I don't deny that there is an issue, and others have reported a similar thing. Only, I have been unable to replicate the latest issue, and so I thought that perhaps if I saw a video I'd see something there that I had overlooked - like some subtle difference in what you were doing compared to what I have tried when I attempt to replicate it.\nEven though it may seem obvious, it has helped me a lot to see that video you posted. If nothing else, it means I can speed up testing by replicating EXACTLY what i see in that video rather than fruitlessly trying lots of other possible things.\n\nCan I ask about all these (probably a dozen+) commits specifically for \"improve logging\" are? I have not read the code but I've been watching them appear for months is there truly still not a way to enable ANY logging in TGS that can instead prove through basic logging what I keep having to spend time shooting/editing videos of that others also confirm is happening with a simple enable of debug logging? I ask because to date in all these issues despite all these \"logging\" commits, you've still never instructed me once on how to collect ANY logs, or even indicated TGS is producing any. I myself would also find it incredibly helpful in troubleshooting to have a TGS log to see just what TGS is doing as it initializes, and what it's parsing when it believes I crashed when I didn't and begins it's session restoring.\n\nThere is indeed console logging! I'm sorry I've never mentioned it to you, and in this instance a log might prove invaluable if you can replicate the issue. To enable debugging, open the extension settings page and in the url, change options.html to debug.html.\nThis will take you to a hidden debug page which allows you to turn logging on and off. Toggle logging on for both debugErrors and debugInfo.\nAfter that, if you open the extension background page (in devtools) you should see a LOT of debug output. The stuff at the very start is the part of interest as it logs why it makes the decisions is does around session restore on startup.\n\n...since as of last night all had finally been fixed to at least show favicons EXCEPT in the most important one - the automatic \"wait 15 min\" suspend which is STILL broken. I also shot a video of that over in issue 478 (several, actually) to back up what others had already reported.\n\nI assume here you are referring to this post you made on issue 478 on the 24th October:\n\n...HOWEVER--for some reason I just watched as a few tabs that performed an AUTOMATIC suspension wound up still suspending incorrectly to a blockhead icon. Of note, after seeing the promising results from manual suspensions, I have once again been running with the new option re-enabled to utilize Chrome's native discarding which may still be impacting the AUTO suspend. I will perform some more thorough testing of the AUTO portion later this AM and report back the results.\n\nYou mentioned that you would report back with results but seeing as you haven't i assumed the issue was resolved. It's odd that you specifically mention 15 minute auto-suspend. I would have thought that it was equally as likely to occur with any time period. I use the 20sec timer when testing this stuff and haven't had any issues with the favicons on automatic suspend so far. Once again though, if you can replicate this, a recording of the log during the issue would be super useful, especially if you can identify the tab id that is causing issues, as all log entries report their tab id to help follow the process flow for each tab.\n\n...wouldn't it be easier for YOU to add a simple enable/disable killswitch (checkbox) at the top of the session management page so those like me that don't even use TGS session management can disable it? Then if we need to report an issue to you, our report automatically eliminates half the code-base dealing with sessions not to mention all that code overhead that never would need to execute.\n\nI understand your frustration here. But if there's a bug, I'd rather identify it and fix it, rather than provide an option to turn off some valuable functionality. If said functionality was turned off manually by a user, then when the extension updates all of their suspended tabs would disappear and WOULD NOT come back. This is not really an option.\n\nAs a DEV been doing this over 30 yrs I also often have taskmgr open anyway, watch ALL chrome tasks die off when I gracefully close chrome (if I run ccleaner it won't even execute if Chrome is active) but regardless of if I do nothing but re-start Chrome, or clean basic cache, TGS is doing something it never did - just like all the other recent new behaviors we've been struggling with. \n\nAll these new issues have arisen due to a complete overhaul of the session and favicon codebase. And this was mostly in response to some major changes in Chrome that caused the earlier version of the extension to fail in some pretty significant ways. So going back is not really an option.\n\nI do not (nor EVER have) allowed Chrome to continue running. When I click \"close\" - 100% all CHROME.EXE tasks gracefully terminate per taskmgr:\n\n\nThis is interesting. I do not have that option in chrome on my mac (in either the production build or canary). Perhaps it is a windows specific thing? Perhaps I'll need to check that out on my PC.\n. @CollinChaffin I've managed to recreate this and should be fixed in the latest release v7.0.143  \ud83c\udf89 . This is a little confusing. Based on your edits, you're saying the issue is with the 'Suspend all tabs in all windows' hotkey, and NOT the 'Force suspend all tabs in all windows'?\nJust to clarify what this option is supposed to do, it basically 'fast-forwards' the auto suspension timer on all tabs and will only suspend them if they would have suspended normally (as opposed to force which suspend no matter what).\nAs far as the active tab goes (in the currently focused window), this will never be suspended using 'Suspend all tabs in all windows'. The active tabs in non-focused windows WILL suspend unless you have the 'Never suspend active tab in each window' option checked.\nI have tested the above behaviour in the current release and it works as expected, both via the context-menu, and the hotkey.. I'm assuming you are actually connected to the internet when this happens?\nAnd also assume you've got 'Automatically unsuspend tab when it is viewed' option checked.\nI will look into this. It's possible it has something to do with you bringing your computer out of sleep mode.. How often would you say it happens? It sounds very much like this chromium bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=678075\nThe extension relies on navigator.onLine to determine if there is internet connectivity. \nAs a workaround it sounds like disconnecting and reconnecting your internet should fix it (as opposed to restarting chrome).. This is most likely a duplicate of these issues: \nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/478\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/719\nCan you confirm if this is still happening on the latest version (v7.0.129)?\nAlso, are these tabs suspended on browser start? Or are they new tabs have become suspended within the current session?\nCan you also please give me the version of your chrome?. I'm hope you're not actually waiting for 15 minutes to watch a tab suspend. There's a 20 second timer that might save you a bit of time if you are ;)\nI don't think that the issue is caused by new code. It seems more likely that it's a new version of chrome that is causing the issue.\nLike I've mentioned elsewhere, I can replicate this issue if I have a window full of suspended tabs, and then close the whole window, and then use the 'undo closed tab' option which restores the whole window. When I do this, most of the suspended tabs fail to restore with their proper icons. I haven't seen this happen with normal tab suspension though, although it seems likely that it's a similar thing happening with chrome.\nI'll see if I can try to replicate your issue somehow. Can you please give me your operating system version, your chrome version, and the latest version of the extension that you've tried?\n. I have made another optimistic fix for this issue, as I was able to sometimes recreate it, but only with the new 'Apply Chrome's built-in memory-saving when suspending' checked and only after immediately loading a window with 100+ suspended tabs.\nSo I'm not sure I'm targeting the same issue as you have reported, but the symptoms are at least the same.\nHere is the relevant commit: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/c1fcbbf757a735117ce65122f918480e267c6104\nI will close this issue as a duplicate of #478.. You are correct in your assumption that this is happening because you are clearing your local storage for the extension every time you close Chrome.\nI've given it some thought, and realised there's room for improvement here. I will now try to differentiate between users who are installing the extension for the first time, and users who have already installed the extension on a different computer with the same chrome profile.\nWhen you install an extension on one chrome profile, it automatically installs it on other computers logged into the same profile. It would be nice for these other automatic installs to not receive the welcome message.\nAll this is to say, if you simply clear your local history (as I suspect is all you are doing) the extension will treat this as if you are undergoing an automatic install, and it will no longer show the welcome screen.\nThis has been implemented in development version 7.0.131 and will be pushed to the webstore soon. \nI hope this is useful to you. . @SnIPeRSnIPeR im hoping within the next 7 days. but it's already been far longer than i anticipated, as more and more issues are coming into gitHub every day... @CollinChaffin I'm not sure if you're posting this in the correct issue. You seem to be referring to previous sessions restoring when you restart chrome, whereas this issue is about seeing the welcome page when you restart chrome. Did you mean to post in this issue instead? #781\nIf so, can you please get back to me in that other issue with my questions I asked of you? It's an issue I would like to have resolved if possible.\nAs far as an option to disable session management, what you're encountering is not so much session management, as it is tab recovery. As you probably know, when the extension updates (or crashes), all suspended tabs disappear. To help mitigate this issue, I try to automatically restore these tabs after the update/crash.\nIn your case, the extension is falsely detecting that you're recovering from an extension crash and is trying to recover your tabs. That is why it would be useful for me to get more detailed information on exactly what chrome settings you have, and what tabs you have open when you encounter this issue.\nBut please, respond to this in the other issue.. That comment is erroneous. This extension does not collect or sell browsing history. I have commented to the person on the chrome webstore.\nThe extension DOES require permission to your chrome history, as this is required for some of the functionality of the app. However, it does not store this history, and does not profit from it in any way.\nFor more information on why the extension needs access to your history please see this gitHub thread: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/213\nAlso, here is a link to the privacy policy for the extension: https://greatsuspender.github.io/privacy. Yes, I agree the 'about' page would be a good place for it.\nThe privacy policy is already linked in the chrome webstore page.. For the 'suspend this tab now' issue - this is most probably a duplicate of issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/735\nI'll look further into the 'suspend all other tabs' issue.. I have committed an optimistic fix for the 'suspend all other tabs issue.\nIt is available in the latest dev version (v7.0.132).\nIf you are able to test on this version, it would be much appreciated. Otherwise, just wait and hope that this fixes your issue when the new release gets pushed to the chrome webstore.. @mauigirl i think your issue is that you need to point it to the src/ folder.\nIn your case it seems like that would be ~/Downloads/great suspender 7/src\nGlad that you resolved your issue anyway :). Firefox is most definitely not supported at this point. When I do implement for firefox I will ensure that these bugs are fixed.\nTo follow the firefox implementation please see this issue: #409. Fix for #727. What happens when you click on the tab that failed to suspend? The popup menu icon will change depending on the currently focused tab. And when you click on it (the popup menu icon) it will tell you the status of the current tab.\nIf the icon is grey, it means that the tab won't automatically suspend (or respond to a 'suspend all other tabs' request). If it is normal colour, then it should respond to this request.\nIn the latest release (not yet on the chrome webstore) the right-click context menu (and the keyboard shortcuts) now has an option to 'force suspend all other tabs in this window'. Which will force all other tabs to suspend regardless of their status.\nThere is a chance you're seeing a bug. Or perhaps that tab is receiving form input which is why it won't suspend.. @mkz7 ok, well i think all i can do is wait for it to happen again for you, and when it does, if you could check the tab status and report back.\none other thing to check is your setting to screen capture. if this is turned on, then it can sometimes take a while for a tab to suspend while it's generating the image preview.\nfor the updates, your extension will automatically update, but it may be a week or so before that happens. if you want a newer version earlier, you can install from source from gitHub.. That's super odd. No idea why that might be happening.\nI'll try to replicate at my end and report back.. @tonsimple @stekern can either of you try out the latest development version of the extension by installing from source from the gitHub project?\nthere have been significant performance improvements since v7.0.109.. @stekern You can turn on logging, however it may not be much help in the event of an extension crash as you might find you lose the log when it crashes.\nTo enable debugging, open the extension settings page and in the url, change options.html to debug.html.\nThis will take you to a hidden debug page which allows you to turn logging on and off. Toggle logging on for both debugErrors and debugInfo.\nAfter that, if you open the extension background page (in devtools) you should see a LOT of debug output. \nCan you post a screenshot of your extension options page so I can see the settings you have set? Also, there is a slightly newer version available now (v7.0.144).. @stekern I've just pushed another commit with further performance improvements for startup. If you haven't already, go straight to version 7.0.145 for further testing.. @stekern thanks for that. is your computer very fast? how much ram does it have? i suspect that this is  a performance issue.\nAnd most notably, from the log it appears that you have screen capturing turned on (which is not the default). Can you confirm this? And try turning this off, as it massively affects performance when suspending tabs.. @stekern Ah yes, sorry about that. There was a bad logging message in the code which erroneously referred to screen captures.\nYou're right that your laptop should not suffer from performance issues. Although my testing on Ubuntu is non-existent.\nThere has been one small performance improvements (bugfix) which may help since we last tried. Although it's pretty minor. Try v7.0.150. And if you could  take another log for me that might be useful.\nJust for some background into why these newer versions are less performant than the older release. It is due to some changes in newer versions of chrome which causes issues with the display of favicons of suspended tabs with the older version of the extension. To fix this, I've had to add extra checking on chrome startup and post tab suspension to ensure that the correct favicon is displayed. Without this, a chrome restart will cause all suspended tabs to show the default blockhead extension favicon. Refer to this issue for more info: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/719\nEdit: I've managed to get a debian VM running and performance does indeed tend to be much poorer. And even managed to get a crash. I've tweaked a couple of things (v7.0.151) and may do a few more tweaks in the next few days, including possibly adding a hidden switch to disable some of the new tab check code which i'm guessing is the cause of the decrease in performance.. i have pushed another considerable change that will hopefully impact performance. If anyone in this thread could try the latest release (v7.0.158) and report back, that would be much appreciated.\n@kju from what you've said about the small number of processes in the task manager, it sounds like you have the new 'Apply Chrome's built-in memory-saving when suspending' option checked. this may account for some of the delay you are experiencing? try turning it off and see if that makes any difference.\n@ressikanflute v7.0.109 of the extension has some major known performance issues. you really need to try the latest beta, or else hold tight for an updated webstore version. I've just pushed some new code (v7.0.158) which gives you a link on the options->about page to a hidden debug page. On this debug page, there is a new link to 'Claim all suspended tabs' which will look for tabs suspended by another version of the extension, and re-associate them with the current version. This should make migrating much much easier :). @stekern any chance you'd want to share with me an export of that session you're trying to load that is crashing your browser? you can email me the text file at deanoemcke (at) gmail (dot) com.\ntotally understand if you'd rather not.\n@ressikanflute thanks for the debugging work. the high CPU after first opening chrome is normal as all the suspended tabs are reloaded. i'm not sure about the extra time when a new tab with content is created however. are you able to temporarily disable the extension to do a comparison test? i can't imagine TGS causes any significant load when a new tab is created.. @stekern Any chance you could trying a chrome restart with a large (>170) number of tabs on the latest build of the extension (v7.0.171) ?\ni have made some more optimisations to the extension initialisation process that may have helped ease cpu load.. I have already experimented with this, and discarding before a suspended tab fully loads can lead to the favicons and tab titles not loading properly. See this issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/719\nHowever, the latest dev version (soon to be released on the chrome webstore) does have a new feature that allows suspended tabs to discard after they have loaded.\nThis does not help you if you are hoping to speed up chrome load times. But it does significantly reduce the memory usage of the extension once all the suspended tabs have finished loading and then discarding.. @tonsimple i have discovered over the past week so new chrome behaviour that must have been implemented in a recent release. this is the cause of all the recent favicon issues that have been observed.\ngiven this new knowledge, i've largely rewritten the startup behaviour of the extension. \nhopefully this will address your crashing issues on session restore.\nas a side note: this new chrome behaviour seems affect opening up a window with a lot of tabs. it seems that now chrome does NOT load all of the tabs, resulting in much better performance.\nyou might find that reloading a session as unsuspended will actually work a lot better for you (assuming you have the latest v70 of chrome).\nLet me know how this works out for you. And if you are on a development version of TGS, then try updating to the latest version (v7.0.136). Related issue for performance issues when opening a window full of suspended tabs: #793. @ekini Thanks for this! It's all russian to me \ud83d\ude43 . This is not actually a bug. It's always been like this. Once the form input option gets trigger it can never 'untrigger' automatically. It will only be cleared if the page reloads or if you manually cancel the form input state.\nThere is already a feature request for detecting when form inputs get cleared and resetting the form input state when this happens: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/654\n. This is odd. In your screenshot it looks like the tabs being displayed belong to the session below (2 windows, 6 tabs)?\nWhat happens if you click on the 'export' link next to the session with 1 window, 49 tabs?. Ok. Well the data should be there somewhere. Try running the code below in the console of the extension background page.\nTo do this, navigate to chrome://extensions and then click on the link for background_page in the box for The Great Suspender. It looks like this:\n\nYou may need to click on 'details' to see the link for the background page.\nThis should pop up a new window. At the bottom of this window should be a place to enter text. Copy and paste the following code and then press enter to run it:\ngsUtils.fetchCurrentSessions().then(o => {\n for (const s of o) {\n  console.log('session: ' + s.date);\n  for (const w of s.windows) {\n    for (const t of w.tabs) {\n      const url = t.url.indexOf('suspended.html') < 0 ? t.url : gsUtils.getSuspendedUrl(t.url);\n      console.log(url);\n    }\n    console.log('\\n');\n  }\n }\n})\nThis should print out the urls for all your current sessions.. You might want to try updating to the latest version on the extension.\nTo do this, you'll need to uninstall and then reinstall the extension from the chrome webstore.\nIMPORTANT! If you do this you will lose all open suspended tabs and all session history to be sure to unsuspend or backup all tabs and session histories first.. This is a duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/265 and https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/220\n. Nice one bro.. Hi. Firstly thanks a lot for donating.\nCan I ask how you made the donation? If via PayPal, then you should have been redirected to a thankyou page, and the donation popups should be removed automatically.\nIf it was via a cryptocurrency then unfortunately this does not happen automatically.\nYou can turn off the donation popups by going into the extension options page, and clicking on the 'about' section in the left-hand sidebar.\nFrom there, click the 'Already donated?' link and this will let the extension know that you have donated.\nI hope this helps, and please let me know if you did donate via paypal, but the donation removal process failed for you.. Have you restarted chrome since doing what i suggested? If not, it's possible that it's only happening on old tabs that were opened before you made the change?\nAlternatively, have you noticed any of your other extension settings being lost?\nAlso, do you use the extension on any other computers? And if so, do you have the 'Sync settings with your Chrome profile' option selected?\nIt's possible that the setting is getting overridden by another extension instance... @Bertoldino I have done some more investigation and it does indeed appear to be an issue with the new chrome sync behaviour.\nI have fixed this issue in the latest dev version (v7.0.141).\nI have also defined some new behaviour whereby if any instance of the extension (on any chrome profile) successfully makes a donation, it will cause all instances to appear as donated and this will be non-reversible, short of uninstalling the extension.. It is still in development sorry but will be available on the chrome webstore shortly.. Thanks so much for this!. Thanks!. Thanks for the feedback.\nCan I get you to clarify a few things for me?\n\n\nIs there a chance that you're in incognito mode? The right-click context menu does not work in incognito mode. \n\n\nDoes it still happen after a chrome restart?\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the 'right-click icon menu' which you say has been removed, and the 'webpage context menu'? \n\n\nThe right-click menu should still be there. For me it looks like this:\n\n\n\nYou seem to be under the impression that the menu items appear directly below the extension name? This has never been the case. They are always grouped together in a submenu as shown in my screenshot. \nIt should be noted that in the latest chrome (v70) it appears that the separators don't seem to display,  i'm currently working on a fix for this.\n. @S-U-M-1 Can you please let me know the version of the extension, the chrome browser, and the OS you are using? \nThanks.. @Jollfye Thanks for getting back to me. I was going to suggest updating as a lot has changed since v7.0.109. \nActually, a lot has changed since v7.0.131 as well. I've rewritten a lot of the code that deals with the session restore and tab suspension. Would you mind updating again (to v7.0.140) to test out the latest code?\nI've tried to replicate your latest issue (the re-suspending after losing focus bug) but can't do so on my current dev version.. @Jollfye Thanks for the bugs reports. There's a lot here :/ \nI'll address them in order:\n\n\nHave you tried the most recent version (v7.0.142)? It's possible that this has been fixed. On my dev version it looks like this:\n\n\n\nOnce again, if you could try on v7.0.142 this issue may have been resolved. I've just finished refactoring all the code that handles the favicons.\n\n\nThe high CPU load is unavoidable unfortunately. in fact, the only reason this is necessary is to ensure the correct favicons get set. The latest version has made some slight optimisations in this process, but the 'bright' favicon is a fallback while waiting for the faded favicon to be produced. The fact that sometimes some favicons do not get replaced suggests that they are failing to completely load. Not sure why this might be.\n\n\nFor the exporting, I'm aware of the limitations of the current export. For now the idea is that it's primarily for exporting to some other application, so i wanted to keep it generic and simple - hence the newline separated unsuspended urls. I agree there's definitely room in the future for providing some other kind of export that includes more metadata such as tab title, favicon, and scroll position. This could perhaps also include settings etc and allow for backing up all sessions in one go. If you want to create a separate feature request issue for this on GitHub you're welcome too :)\n\n\n(Your final comment about doubling of tabs on startup), this is a troubling issue. I'd love to find out more information about it from you if possible. \nWhat do you have set in chrome -> settings -> On start-up? \nCan you repeat the issue consistently? If so, can you please give me the exact steps to reproduce?\n\n\nThanks for all your feedback!\n. @Jollfye for the last issue (no. 5) it is perhaps a duplicate of issue https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/781 which should now be resolved in the latest version (v7.0.143). @Jollfye \n1. This should be fixed in the latest build. It actually means on my computer it looks like this: \n\nBut it's a trade off and should look normal on yours (and I think most others).\n\n\nThe latest version also contains some more favicon fixes. Perhaps this will finally resolve your favicon issues?\n\n\nOnce again, the favicon fixes in the latest release will hopefully resolve any outstanding issues you have with favicons not being set properly after chrome restart.\n\n\nPlease let me know if the latest version resolves some of your outstanding issues.. @Jollfye Sorry, but I've just made another refactor of the favicon code.\nI managed to replicate your issue and made some changes to clean up the code and improve startup performance.\nWant to give it another shot? ~~v7.0.145~~ v7.0.147\nThere should be no intermediate blank or bright icons anymore. Suspended tabs should go straight from the extension (suspendy face) icon to the correct faded favicon.. @Jollfye Thanks for getting back to me with your findings. Good to hear it's mostly fixed :)\nI'll leave this issue open as the primary issue for the right-click menu bug.\nFor the other tab favicon issues, please post any new issues you find on this thread: #478. Thanks for this. I like the possibilities this opens up for theming of the extension in a very simple way. I'll keep it in mind.. @syd-h :\n\nThe right click contextual menu now is missing the quick 'settings' option? Instead it's filled with extra... stuff. Is there not a way we can edit this menu? I could get rid of the majority of these options in favor or just have a few major ones among 'settings'.\n\nThis was removed as I didn't think people would want to access the extension settings that often. Whereas all the other options are more 'repeat usage' commands. What is your use-case for needing to repeatedly access settings? Perhaps you're really trying to access session history?\n\nAdditionally, PLEASE DO NOT force reload the browser main page when the extension updates. EVER.\n\nUnfortunately this is unavoidable during an extension update. See this issue for more information on why this is the case: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526. @mceachen If possible, would you be able to try out the latest development version of the extension (v7.0.142)? And let me know if the font is more readable?. > Some of that could be changed by having the two never suspend options as toggles like the options above them in the menu.\nCan you clarify what you mean by this? Which part of the extension are you referring to and what do you propose it should look like?. Perhaps Whitelist/Unwhitelist this URL might be better wording.\nI'll give it some thought.. I have updated this issue to reflect the feature requesting of whitelist toggling via keyboard shortcuts.\nFor the issue of font readability:\n@mceachen @syd-h Can you confirm whether you are still having issues with this on the latest development build (v7.0.142 or later)? If so, a screenshot would be useful as well as details about screen resolution etc.\nI have tried to recreate the issue on a few hi-res screens (on both mac and pc) and haven't noticed any problems. As shown here:\n\n. @mceachen thanks for double checking the font issue. pleased to hear it's sorted.\nfor the wiki article, actually that's outdated and all the information is now on the main readme. i've deleted the wiki article now.\nand there are two different ways to install the dev version. either directly from a downloaded zip (which is how the wiki was saying to do it), or by cloning the git repo. both these methods are outlined on the main github readme.\nthanks again :). Actually, I think @Timmy123456789 is asking for a way to easily disable the entire extension, not just a single tab. \nThis has already been requested here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/256\nWill leave this closed as a duplicate.. I assume the url you were meant to post was https://www.realclearpolitics.com ?\nI can't replicate this sorry. It seems to suspend fine with a 20 second timeout both on v6.30 and the latest development version.\nAre you sure the site hasn't been whitelisted or is paused due to form input or something?. @rwheels I've managed to reproduce your issue, although not with a 20 second suspend timer.\nThe issue is as you guessed, because the tab is performing a reload by itself, this resets the suspend timer.\nFor me it looks like the reload happens every 5 minutes, which means any suspend timer of 5 minutes or more will fail to suspend the tab.\nI'll keep this issue open, although I won't be able to do anything about it right now, as the extension using this trigger (tab loading complete) as part of it's calculation to determine how long a tab has been open for.. @SEXXES definitely check out the latest dev version. there was a bug that affected CPU performance in 7.0.109 which has been fixed.\n. Closing as duplicate of #793. I'm probably not going to implement similar functionality as i'd like to stick to the core purpose of this extension.\nWhen I have a moment, I'll check what is causing the incompatibility.. @adcurtin could you elaborate on your problem with google keep a bit?\nto be clear, you're wanting google keep to suspend even though it has unsaved form input, but don't want to uncheck this option as you still want other form input tabs to prevent automatic suspension?\nthis most likely a duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/705\n. Hey. Sorry but this is not the best place for this kind of question. Your best bet is to try stack overflow.\nChrome does not have an api for suspending tabs. The closest you can get is to discard a tab. But you can only do this on tabs that have already been created.\nTo do this, once a tab has been created you can call chrome.tabs.discard(<tabId>) to discard it.. All I can suggest is that perhaps you're putting the files in the wrong location? Sorry but I don't know much more about manually manipulating indexedDb files than you.\nI can only assume that if chrome is deleting the files, then they must be somehow corrupt.\nYou should be able to do some testing to make sure your process is working. \n1. Go to the url chrome://version to get your profile path (on my mac it is /Users/dean/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default\n2. Find the extension indexedDb folders on your filesystem which should be within your profile path. ie: /Users/dean/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/IndexedDB/chrome-extension_klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg_0.indexeddb.blob and /Users/dean/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/IndexedDB/chrome-extension_klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg_0.indexeddb.leveldb\n3. Create some saved sessions within the extension.\n4. Backup the folders listed above.\n5. Delete your saved sessions from within the extension.\n6. Try to restore them by copy back over the backed up folders.\nThat will at least test the process on some known good data. Once you can confirm that works (I've not actually tried to do this before so it may not), then you will have a better idea how to restore from your possibly corrupt files.\nHope that gives you something to work with.\nLet me know if you discover anything worth sharing with the community.\n . @macsunmood \ni have tried doing what i suggested and it seems to work fine for me. that is:\n1. backup the chrome-extension_<ext_id>_0.indexeddb.blob and chrome-extension_<ext_id>_0.indexeddb.leveldb folders in my <profile_path>/IndexedDB/ folder\n2. uninstall the extension from within chrome\n3. reinstall the extension from within chrome\n4. close chrome\n5. delete the new folder created in the  <profile_path>/IndexedDB/ folder\n6. copy the old backup folders into the <profile_path>/IndexedDB/ folder\n7. restart chrome\ndoing this results in all my old settings and saved sessions.\nAs for your last question about .log files. I do not know exactly what these are or how IndexedDB databases are stored locally on the filesystem.\nI'm not sure why the process I've described above does not work for you. It should as it does for me.\nI would suggest trying to get that working again.\nAlso, perhaps your old backup could be from an older version of chrome? They may be some incompatibility trying to restore older indexedDb backups on a newer version of chrome? Just a guess though. \nIf you wanted to send me your backed up folders (zipped) i could always try restoring them for you. I understand if you'd rather not though due to privacy considerations.. @macsunmood I've tried to recover based on your files but have had the same result as you :(\nMy only thought is that the backup you provided only contains .ldb files. My extension folder also has a .log file and several other files like CURRENT, LOCK, LOG, and MANIFEST-xxxx.\nI suspect some of these files might be required in conjunction with the .ldb files you provided.. The thinking behind this change was that whitelisting a tab is something you only need to do once, and I wanted to clean up the suspended tab page.\nIt's true that if the icon is not set to show, then it makes it much harder to whitelist a tab.\nThere is a related feature request to add a keyboard shortcut to toggle whitelisting of the currently visible tab: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/810. @orschiro I have been unable to replicate this on my computer. The tab suspends fine after 10 minutes.\nOne thing you can try is looking at the debug screen to see what status that tab has. To open the debug screen, first open the extension options page, and then change the url from options.html to debug.html.\nThis should take you to a screen which shows all your open tabs and their current status according to the extension. If the tab will automatically suspend, it's status should be 'normal' and it should have a 'time to suspend' of less than 10 minutes in the future.\nThere is another issue which is slightly related, although it doesn't appear to be the issue in your case: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/812 . Fixed in https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/827\n@paysonblackwell thanks for identifying the issue. and @CollinChaffin thanks for implementing :). Fixed with PR #827. @AlphaWong just to be clear, what images are we talking about here? are you referring to the ones located at /src/img/ ?\nIs your concern solely with the package size of the extension? If so, I really don't see an extra few KBs really making any difference?. @orschiro \nhmmm.. why not just remove the space between the hash and url in your above example?\nthat will effectively create a whitelist entry that never matches.\nlet me know if you think that's a fair workaround. it's certainly less development work for me :D. @CollinChaffin thanks so much for this. Sorry, I've been away on holiday so only found out about this last night. Also, all my chrome 'dev' testing is done on Canary, so I'm a bit surprised that this only appears in the Dev channel. I assumed that Canary would also have these changes?\nI will follow up this PR with some cleanup of the init error handling code as you suggested.\n@Jollfye I'm investigating your two issues now and will push some fixes soon.\nThanks everyone for all the debugging. It's been invaluable.. @Jollfye i have fixed the donate buttons issue. \nfor the session management issue, it appears that it's specific to your particular session. are you comfortable giving me an export of the session that's causing you issues?\nyou can always try updating and testing the latest version first if you'd prefer to see if it's magically been fixed first... I'm not sure what could be causing this sorry. Short of the extension being uninstalled and reinstalled again.\nAll the keyboard shortcuts are set and managed by chrome. Perhaps the best place to look for an answer would be on the chrome forums?. @fwextensions yes, there is some domain level favicon caching which explains the issue. i've just pushed a fixed for this (v7.0.159).. @zen2go is this a session that you've imported from a different browser? the white document page icon will show if chrome does not have a favicon for the tab url in it's cache. so alternatively, possibly you've cleared the cache of the browser?\ni have tested with brave and it behaves normally for me.. See commit: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/20636d9dc2170f06053a6a8bd746eaa8341b9441 for suggestions made by @Jollfye. /192\\.168\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}/ should do it :). Here's a proper link to that repo: https://github.com/ekonoval/TabsLazyLoad_thegreatsuspender/commits/master\nI believe this approach will cause potential issues with the suspended tabs. Without waiting for the page to load before suspending, there's a chance that the title and favicon information won't be available to the suspended tab.\nAlso, I'll close this as a duplicate of this other issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/49. Yeah, I know this is a pain. There's already an issue for this: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/720\n. @VOVPro are you saying this has been resolved for you? \n@byaka are you still having this issue?. Thanks for the feedback. I also like this idea. There's already a feature request for it: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/256. As @liamjohnston said, there would be a few things missing if you simply used about:blank. But essentially, that's what this extension does. It just runs a little javascript on the suspend page as well, so that it can try to retain the extension favicon and title.. This has been fixed in the latest dev release. It's been far too long coming, but I promise I'm trying to get it out there soon!\nHere's the duplicate issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/719. Sorry but I cannot replicate this issue. If you are familiar with installing extensions from source, can you try with the latest development version of the extension? \nThe latest is v7.0.159.. I'm unable to recreate either of these issues (the tabs suspending too early, and the tabs unsuspending automatically). I have tried both chrome dev, and canary, and enabling the flags you mentioned, but despite all this, I cannot get the extension to break.\n@liamjohnston You have managed to replicate the first of these issues consistently so I'm sure the problem is real, I just cannot replicate on my machine for whatever reason.. Thanks for the feedback. This is actually kindof a known (and partially fixed) issue: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/564\nThere's a couple of things here. Firstly, there seems to be some kind of issue in chrome whereby an extension cannot have a rightclick context menu in both a regular window AND an incognito one. Once you open an incognito tab, it was transferring the context menu over to the incognito one and removing it from the normal window. \nTo get around this, I prevent the rightclick context menu from being visible in incognito windows. And I have also remove the ability to set this from options from within incognito windows.\nI'm a little surprised when you mention \"once I go into the Great Suspender settings, and I un-tick and re-tick the option to Add The Great Suspender to right-click context menu\". I didn't think it was possible to do this from within the options screen in an incognito window. Perhaps that was removed in a later version of the extension?\nAnyway, the TLDR is: Due to weird chrome limitations, the right-click context menu is not available from within incognito windows :(. Can you try the latest build (v7.0.164). This is hopefully now resolved.. @Jollfye @MonsterNya I've actually just made some more changes in this area which will have affected the earlier code fix for this issue.\nCould you retest with the latest version (v7.0.165) ?. @MonsterNya You're saying that somethings changed and now you can't suspend tabs at all via popup or context menu while the tab is loading?\nThere is some code to say that if this tab has never been suspended before, then it MUST wait for the tab to finish loading before suspending, otherwise it can't get the proper page title (or screen capture if that setting is enabled).\nHowever, if you're trying to suspend a loading tab that has already suspended before (based on url), then it SHOULD let you suspend it immediately, regardless of whether you use the keyboard shortcut, popup menu, or right click context menu.\nIt works as described above for me. What URL are you trying with? Perhaps if the tab is under heavy load then it may take a while for the suspend command to reach it?\nBut it shouldn't be any worse than it was.. @MonsterNya I don't think the issue is related to the recent version change, or whether you suspend via the popup or the rightclick context menu.\nIn your video, the reason why it works for the old version is probably because those links have already been suspended before (which is why it suspends so quickly).\nIn the second part, I think that what could be happening is that the suspend request times out (after 1 minute). So if the page takes longer to load than 60 seconds, it will no longer suspend after it's finished loading. Is that possible?. @MonsterNya ok, i can see something is definitely not right for you. not sure what. can you try to replicate the issue and send me a copy of the debug log as it happens?\nthere's a wiki on how to enable the debug log here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/wiki/How-to-enable-the-debugging-log. @MonsterNya Thanks for the log. Good news - I think I've worked it out!\nFirstly, apologies from me as I think it was an issue with the popup \ud83d\ude2c.\nIt turns out to be a Windows quirk, as chrome'swindows.onFocusChanged event operates differently on Windows vs OSX. \nShould be fixed now in v7.0.170\nLet me know if you're still having issues. And thanks for helping me debug this one.. @MonsterNya \nThat is exactly right. i cannot guarantee that I will have the page title until the page has finished loading. And it's also true for the favicon (if that domain has never been visited before).\nThere is possibly a way to slightly shortcut this process but it's not worth adding the extra complexity. You may find it still works if you cancel loading of the page early, but there will be cases when this does not work. And I need to be 100% sure.\nOnce a url has fully loaded, I cache the page title and favicon, so that next time we can interrupt loading and suspend instantly.\n. @jpbianchi I can reproduce this. It's a strange bug. Unfortunately, the handling of hotkeys is outside of my control. All I receive within the extension is a message to say that that particular hotkey action was triggered (incorrectly in this case).\nPossibly related to this chromium bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=890418\nI know it's a pain, but perhaps your best option is to change the keyboard shortcuts you're using?\nAnd submitting a bug report to the chromium team is probably a good idea too.. @jpbianchi For the CPU load issue. It sounds like this is happening when you accidentally unsuspend all your tabs? If this is the case, it's really a chrome issue, there's not much I can do about it unfortunately (the CPU load I mean). \nI'll investigate whether I can somehow interrupt the tab loading and force the tabs to suspend quickly.\n. I have just committed a change that allows tabs to be suspended even during loading. This should help somewhat when trying to stop all your tabs from reloading (v7.0.165).\nIt seems that you are also suggesting that I stagger the unsuspending process when unsuspending a large number of tabs at the same time? This is a little off topic for this issue. Would you mind creating a new issue for this (as a feature request)? \nThanks!. Thanks heaps for all this work @MonsterNya and @Jollfye .\nYou guys are awesome!. @MonsterNya @Jollfye let me know when you guys are finished and i'll do the merge.. @MonsterNya \n\n157 line.

I like @AlexWayfer suggestion of:\n\n%session% [open and suspend] [open and load] [export] [delete]\n\n. > I have too superficially described my question\n\n\n\n@MonsterNya sorry about the misunderstanding. you've discovered a secret untranslated view :)\nTo avoid merge conflicts, I have made the fix for this in a seperate branch: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/tree/feature/internationalised-restore-view\nAnd there is an issue for it too: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/856\nIt currently does NOT include russian translations (although I've used google translate for the chinese and german files).\n@MonsterNya @Jollfye @AlexWayfer Could one of you handle the translations on that branch?\n. Are we all happy with merging this PR now? (ignoring those issues handled in other internationalisation branch).. If it's OK with everyone I'm going to merge this PR now?. @MonsterNya the extension explicitly uses the 'system-ui' font which I suppose is different depending on the operating system. I'm not sure how this interacts with chrome or operating system defaults. But whatever we go with, it shouldn't involve changing either of these anyway.\nI'm not sure the best way to test this. Perhaps you guys will know better than me?\n@liamjohnston do you have any idea about this?. I'm not 100% sure exactly what you guys are talking about. But I would suggest we assume the best case scenario within the extension. That is, that all system fonts will correctly render the \u0451 character.\nAm I correct in assuming that for those instances when this character is not available, it will fall back to the \u0435 character? This seems like an acceptable compromise for those few users that find themselves in this position. And leaves the onus on the OS to improve their character support.\nI'm not exactly sure what the alternative is that we are proposing here. To not use \u0451 at all, and use \u0435 instead? I'd rather we kept the extension language file as accurate as possible, so I'm all for using \u0451 everywhere.\nBut I'm not the most informed to make this decision. I just thought I'd let you know my opinion to help us finish up the awesome work that you guys have all done here :) . @Bohojo777 You will need to give me a bit more information as to exactly how it has stopped working for you. Otherwise I can't do much to help sorry.\nAnd as @Jollfye mentioned, it would greatly help if you could give me your extension version. And ideally try the latest version of the extension if you're technically able.\nThanks.. @kliop00023 the latest version within the gitHub project is ahead of that on the chrome webstore. i'm trying right now to update it. \nthis is why I have asked the OP what version they are using. there's a high chance that their problem has been fixed and it's just a matter of waiting for the new release.. I'm not sure about this one. Or actually even if it's possible.\nBut what is the use case for it? Wouldn't you want all of your extensions to either be in one language or the other. \nIt seems to me that to implement a language switching option within TGS means that you would want this extension specifically in one language while keeping all your other extensions in their native chrome language.\nWhy do you want to do this?. I've discovered this bug before and thought I had fixed it.\nFirst can you confirm whether you can recreate this issue by simply closing a window with suspended tabs and then reopening it via ctrl+shift+t ? (ie. you shouldn't need to close chrome).\nWhat should happen is that the window reappears and all the suspended tabs initially have the TGS icon. But after about 3 seconds the favicons will all update to their correct versions.\nCan you also try testing with a window with A LOT of tabs, and one with just a few tabs? Does the bug happen on just one of them?\n. @MonsterNya for the second issue (the blank/white suspended tab), this seems like a suspended tab that failed to initialise.\nI believe in a recent commit (the one to fix the bug where a tab would unsuspend if you suspend it while it's still loading), I made a change that should detect this and fix it when the problem tab gains focus. \nCan you try the latest build and see if you can recreate? Thanks :). ok. i think i know what is going on. the favicon check when tabs are restored with ctrl+shift+t only activates after the extension has been initialised. if you restore tabs or windows via this method when you first open chrome while the extension is still initialising, the check doesn't activate.\nmy guess is that this is a pretty niche situation. not a lot of people use the reopen closed tab feature. and doing this after a chrome restart is even rarer (i didn't even know that you could do this!).\nso will probably just not worry about this particular bug. unless you disagree?. @AronRubin as MonsterNya has commented, this should not be an issue anymore. Are you still having problems? What version of the extension are you using?. I'm unable to recreate this. Suspending selected tabs via the rightclick context menu works fine for me.\nIf I select multiple tabs (by holding down cmd and clicking the tab favicons) and then right click somewhere on the page of the currently focused tab, I get the TGS context menu. This does NOT unselect my tabs. And when I choose 'Suspend selected tabs' this suspends all the tabs I had highlighted.\nPerhaps this is specific to the windows implementation of chrome?\nUPDATE: Yes, it appears this is an issue under windows only. Not sure whether this should be filed under a chromium bug or not?. Thanks for the details report.\nI was able to replicate this. It turns out to be a problem with how I am encoding the urls in the export. (for the record, I think it's the # symbol in the gmail tab that is causing it to fail?).\nAnyway, this code has since been rewritten and the same tabs under the latest dev version (v7.0.164) works fine.\nThe new version will be pushed out to the webstore shortly.. There is a branch to fix this: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/tree/feature/internationalised-restore-view\n@MonsterNya @Jollfye @AlexWayfer Currently waiting on Russian translations.\n@saitooo Any chance you could take a look at the German translations?\n@hermanho @goodjack @neighborhood999 Any chance one of you could take a look at the Chinese translations?. \nThere is also some untranslated text in the session history view (above).\nThis has also be added to the branch.. @AlexWayfer Not broken I think, it just takes a really long time to load (as it's so big :)\nI agree with changing the english text to 'open and suspend' and 'open and load'. You can make this change yourself if you want in the other PR, and also use this as a basis for the russian translations.. Branch internationalised-restore-view merged with master: e122ff570228b142d11f054df7cf536e73a5e03f. @AlexWayfer I'm ok with using the complete word version. @Jhoander Can you clarify for me whether the tabs are loading as suspended or unsuspended when you start chrome? That is, once everything has finished loading and your computer is responsive again, are the tabs in a suspended state or a loaded state?\nI'm assuming you have 'Continue from where I left off' set in your chrome options.\nFrom my experience, chrome has improved vastly recently in terms of startup time when restoring many tabs. It seems that these days it does not even attempt to load most tabs, it just sets the favicon and thats about it. This makes starting chrome with unsuspended tabs actually really fast.\nI've found the problem is actually trying to start chrome when restoring a lot of suspended tabs. This is because unless I forcefully reload each one on startup, it won't set the proper favicon (it will use the default extension icon by default).\nI'd like to explore this further if you have the time. Perhaps you could create a quick video to demonstrate what is happening for you? This seems to be a good program for achieving this: https://www.screentogif.com/. @belg4mit can you give me the version of the extension you are using? there was an issue with v7.0.109 (the current webstore version) that would cause massive CPU load once tabs reached a critical mass.. @belg4mit i have indeed incorporated most of those ideas already :)\nfavicons are retrieved from chromes cache, and the semi-transparent version of those favicons is cached within the extension.\nthe issue is actually with the suspended tabs. in order to update the favicon from the default, i need to be able to execute javascript on the tab. however, it seems that chrome has made some optimisations when restarting with lots of open tabs. it seems to lazy load non-focused tabs only when they gain focus. Which means that all the suspended tabs are unresponsive to commands from the extension. The only way around this that I have found is to request a reload of all the suspended tabs. Once they have reloaded, I can then run js on them to update the favicon and title.. Sorry about this. It is a bug with the old version (v6.30) caused by a change in the code of chrome.\nIt is fixed in the current dev version and will be released to the webstore very shortly.\nDuplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/719. I have confirmed this and also fixed it (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/ab14e1e4b8dc6d412bf2536e8a98e05723db7b7a)\n:)\n. I agree that screenshot is not ideal. FWIW it looks much nicer on a mac :P\n\nHere is your suggested alternative on OSX:\n\n\nNot sure about the second one, although perhaps with the css styling changes it could be more acceptable.\n@liamjohnston What do you think?\n . I've discovered the cause of the bad spacing (css issue where we assumed that all shortcut combos were single characters - which is true on a mac).\nI've made some changes to help with readability across both mac and windows.\nHere's some screenshots (dark theme are on mac, light theme are on windows):\n\n\n\n. @liamjohnston nah, i'm just going to use space characters and the special 'middle dot' (U+00B7) character as a separator.\nHere's a demo:\n\n\n\nI'm pretty happy with it. What you think?\nNote also I removed the special \u21e7 (shift) \u2303 (control) and \u2325 (option) characters as I don't think these are well known - even to mac users. I'm leaving the \u2318 one as this is actually written on the keyboard and i think everyone is fairly familiar with it.. Hmmm. I found that the space version doesn't look so good without the \u2318 character.\nie:\n\nHere's an alternative with the dot (but no spacing):\n\n\n. \n. Thanks for this. Should be fixed in v7.0.172. Duplicate of: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/865\nAlso, I am unable to replicate this on my windows 10 machine (TGS v7.0.109 and v7.0.172, and chrome v72.0.3626.109)\n@avatards @makedir Could you please provide an exact extension version number, operating system, and chrome version?\nAnd would it be possible for either of you to capture this behaviour in a video (screenToGif is a good application to do this)? Please see my video of the steps I am taking to try (and failing) to replicate this issue. Am I missing something here?\n\n. @kliop00023 I'm not sure I follow. How would that extension help me recreate this bug?. @avatards thanks for the video. i agree that it definitely seems to be TGS that is causing the window focus.\nhowever, i'm still unable to recreate this on my windows 10 machine! here is another screen capture of my attempts to replicate your process.\nOS: Windows 10 Pro (64bit)\nBrowser: Google Chrome v72.0.3626.119 (64bit)\nExtension: TGS v7.0.109\n\ni'm struggling to work out what to do next. I'll do some googling to see if I can find something but otherwise, can you think of anything on your system that might be different to me?\nSome things to try:\n- does chrome itself steal focus if you no longer have it as the focused application? ie. you've switch to notepad or something else.\n- can you try to install chrome dev, and/or chrome canary and see if the same thing happens?\n- go to chrome:flags and reset all your flags to their default settings.. @makedir @avatards @kliop00023 @noctarius @austinhutchison @aghebert \nI can think of one obvious cause for this issue. With that in mind, I've created a new branch with an optimistic fix: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/tree/bugfix/stealing-focus\nUnfortunately, because I cannot reproduce, I can't test it.\nCan as many of you as possible try loading the extension from the source of this branch and see if you still have issues? The branched version is 7.0.176.\n. @noctarius so glad it's fixed it.\nactually, the issue was with a hack I was using to prevent a history entry being created when i suspended the tab. instead of using chrome.tabs.update(tabId, suspendedUrl) to change the url, i was calling window.location.replace(suspendedUrl).\nthe history stuff was just some code i was playing around with to try to remove this redundant history entry via chrome.history.deleteUrl instead.\nnot sure if there really is a chromium bug here. i think it's reasonable for them to expect that window.location.replace should only be called when the tab already has focus - most likely as a result of a user action.  . The fix for this has now been merged into master (v7.0.177). I've updated the title to reflect the real issue. Not sure if there's anything I can do about this though :(\nHere's a relevant SO question about detecting scroll position of embedded pdfs: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33798543/detect-if-a-user-scrolls-to-the-bottom-of-an-embedded-pdf. Just for completeness, here's the canonical thread for whitelisting pdfs: #257. @MReed1959 unfortunately that is an edge case i doubt we'll be able to handle. i've checked the tab meta info provided by the chrome API for that url, and there is nothing in there to indicate to me that it's displaying a pdf. there's no way of distinguishing this from any other 'normal' tab.\nit seems that checking for '.pdf' in the url is that only option we have at this point.\n---------- EDIT ----------\nactually, if we inspect the dom of that tab, it does show an embedded pdf element:\n<embed width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" name=\"plugin\" id=\"plugin\" src=\"https://www.cypress.com/file/177971/download\" type=\"application/pdf\" internalinstanceid=\"5\">\nwe could potentially use this to detect tabs containing a pdf.. @mihir6692 I'm unable to reproduce this issue. I also doubt that it is caused by this extension. i don't do any manipulation of tab ordering, so this extension should not have any affect on the default chrome behaviours.\nyou could try to disable the extension and see if you still have the issue. just be careful as it will cause all your suspended tabs to disappear. so either unsuspend all your tabs before disabling the extension, or back them up via some other method (like an external session management extension).. Just to add to this, i'd like to reference a related issue on the extension privacy policy: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/786\nThe privacy policy itself can be found here: https://greatsuspender.github.io/privacy. @egonil I have updated the content security policy to explicitly define rules for child-src, connect-src, img-src, and default-src. Firstly, I'd like to redirect people to the pinned issue that justifies a lot of the permissions required by this extension: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/213\nFrom crxcavator.io:\n\ncookies | Gives your extension access to the\u00a0chrome.cookies\u00a0API. | Critical\n\nThis is only necessary until everyone has migrated to v7.x (from v6.30). I no longer use cookies but still need permission in v7.x to remove all cookies created prior to v7. Cookies need to be removed due to this bug: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537\nThis permission can be removed after v7 has been pushed out to 100% of webstore users.\n\nhttps:/// | Gives your extension access to run on all 'https' sites. | High\nhttp:/// | Gives your extension access to run on all 'http' sites. | High\n\nThis is core functionality in order to be able to run content scripts and execute remote js code on ALL websites (as we need them all the best able to suspend). Features that currently rely on this ability are:\n- Form input detection. The extension listens for keypresses inside of form elements to prevent tabs with partially completed forms from suspending (and losing all the typed input).\n- Screen capture. The extension executes a third party library (html2canvas) within the context of the website to capture the contents of the screen and produce an screenshot of what was on the screen before the tab suspended. Note that the chrome.tabCapture API cannot be used here as it only allows us to capture a visible tab.\n\nhistory | Gives your extension access to the\u00a0chrome.history\u00a0API. | High\n\nThis permission is only required to 'tidy up' the urls in the session history to remove any suspended tab entries. They are always duplicates of the real urls and just clutter up the history if left in there.\nFor more information on this behaviour (and it's limitations), refer to this issue: #717\n\ntabs | Gives your extension access to privileged fields of the\u00a0Tab\u00a0objects used by several APIs including\u00a0chrome.tabs\u00a0and\u00a0chrome.windows. In many circumstances your extension will not need to declare the\u00a0\"tabs\"\u00a0permission to make use of these APIs. | High\n\nFrom the chrome documentation: \"if you require access to the url, title, or favIconUrl properties of tabs.Tab, you must declare the \"tabs\" permission in the manifest\".\nThis extension makes heavy use of the url, title, and faviconUrl properties of the Tab objects. This is core functionality.\n\nstorage | Gives your extension access to the\u00a0chrome.storage\u00a0API. | Medium\nunlimitedStorage | Provides an unlimited quota for storing HTML5 client-side data, such as databases and local storage files. Without this permission, the extension or app is limited to 5 MB of local storage. | None\n\nThis extension uses the chrome.storage API to enable syncing of settings between computers with the same chrome profile. However, it also requires the local storage permission as it was initially built using the local storage API and it is preferred (by me) due to it's synchronous behaviour. It also requires unlimited storage in order to guarantee that it will be able to record an infinite number of tabs and saved sessions within the session history feature.\n\ncontextMenus | Gives your extension access to the\u00a0chrome.contextMenus\u00a0API. | None\n\nThis is core functionality to enable the right click context menu.\n\nhttps://greatsuspender.github.io/ | Unknown permission | Unknown\n\nThis extension does a ping out to this particular url to see if there is an urgent notice that needs to be displayed to the users. This has never been necessary in the past and can probably be removed from the project if it's considered a risk.\n\nchrome://favicon/* | Unknown permission\n\nThis extension relies heavily on chrome's internal favicon cache to source and display placeholder favicons on suspended tabs.\n. @egonil I think there are just a couple of takeaways from this:\n\nThe cookies permission should be removed in a subsequent release of the extension (v8?).\nPotentially remove the history cleanup functionality from the extension if it's judged that the perceived risk of the permission outweighs the benefits of having a cleaner session history.\nPotentially remove the external ping to https://greatsuspender.github.io. @shkey wow, this is quite a major rewrite! how confident are you of the changes you are making? my expertise is limited to google translate so I have no way of telling!\n\nalso, does this mean that the traditional chinese translations are probably incorrect too?\n@hermanho @goodjack @neighborhood999 do you have any comment on this PR?\n. @hermanho thanks!\nand yes, those modal strings are obsolete.. @shkey thanks so much for this. @shkey i'd like to say the next week. but i've been saying that for months. there's just testing to do.. Thanks for the feedback. This has already been requested: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/448\nUnfortunately, there is no practical way of implementing this feature right now, although I would really like to see it happen too!. Updated title to reflect the new direction of this thread.\nAs a developer, I can sympathise with this. Although, probably the majority of the time, I don't care if an inspected tab suspends. Perhaps because I have quite a long (6 hours) timeout, it's never really an issue for me. I can only imagine that you have quite a short timeout if you're being interrupted during a debugging session? Either that or you just have an amazing talent for multi-tasking :P\nI think the real issue here would be how to go about implementing this from a UI perspective. It's niche enough that I probably wouldn't want it as it's own dedicated option.\n. The latest version of the extension has actually changed this and it will be available in the chrome webstore shortly. Please see this screenshot for how you might now manage this:\n\n. @Strangehill also, you may be interested in this feature request to add a way to close all suspended tabs (not implemented yet): https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/281. @wdhwg001 sorry, this issue has been fixed but only in the current development version. it will hopefully be released soon!\nDuplicate of: #719. This is most probably due to the 'Instantly suspend when system memory gets very low' feature which is turned on by default in v7.0.109\nMore info can be found here: #596. Thanks for your help @hermanho . Thanks for the feedback. The feature you're after is being called a blacklist. There is already a feature request for that: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/145. Thanks for the feedback. This is a know bug and has been fixed in the current development version: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/853\nIt will be released to the webstore shortly.. I believe this is a duplicate of: #865\nSeems like it was caused by a change in behaviour with chrome.\nIt should be fixed in the upcoming release.. Sorry about this. This is a known issue: #853\nIt has been fixed in the latest development version and will be pushed to the webstore shortly.\n. @garethgeorge thanks so much for this great idea!\ni liked it so much that i've pushed it into the current release candidate.\ni hope you dont mind, but i haven't used any of your code, as i felt it would be better implemented with a button.\nto keep things simple i'm using the window.alert modal. this does mean that the output is limited to the number of matching urls it can show.\nLet me know what you think: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/bb1ca749d8ab5749787c43dc741a9fa2842cb517\n. @garethgeorge oh, and /*/ is not a valid regex.\n* means zero or more of, and needs to be preceded by a character to match. ie: \n/x*/ would match zero or more x characters\n/[0-9]*/ would match zero or more numbers from 0 to 9\n/.*/ would match ANY character zero or more times (. is a special character)\nSo what you probably meant to do with /*/ is actually /.*/\n. Lets put it in this release! :P. Actually, chrome doesn't give me any information about which desktop/space a window is currently in. It also does not give me any way to control which desktop/space a newly created window gets opened in, nor how large to make that window.\nUnfortunately, if during the update a whole window gets closed (because every single tab in that window was suspended) then when the window is recreated, it may well be in a different desktop and with different window dimensions.\nA workaround to protect yourself from this happening it to ensure that there is always at least 1 tab unsuspended in each window. The easiest way to achieve this is to make sure the option 'Never suspend active tab in each window' option is checked, and to ensure you never leave the window open on a suspended tab (otherwise the now non-active one will also suspend).\nYou can also submit a feature request for this, there may be something I can do in future to ensure that at least one tab is unsuspended before performing the update.\nAlso to clarify one other thing. Are you saying that all your tabs got restore in an UNsuspended state? This should not have been the case, they should all reappear, but in their original suspended state. This makes the recovery of all the tabs much faster. Although it can still cause some significant CPU usage for a while.\nThanks, and sorry about the troubles you're having.. @yanamal thanks a lot for address all my questions. much appreciated. if it's ok with you, i'll close this issue as there's not much to do here that is not covered in the new feature request.\nis it clear to you why the behaviour is different if all tabs are suspended vs if there is at least one tab unsuspended? to answer, it's because when the extension updates, it has to restart the extension process, and all the suspended tabs are tied to that process. so when the extension process restarts, all the suspended tabs disappear. a window with no tabs in it is automatically closed, whereas if there is at least one tab left, it will remain open. the only way to retain information like window desktop and window dimensions is to not close the window at all. on restart the extension is smart enough to work out which open windows the suspended tabs belonged to, so if that window is still open it will be able to readd the tabs back in. if it's been closed, it will have to create a new window and then readd the tabs.. I think you'll find that the 'save changes' prompt is something to do with the wordpress site itself. You can test this simply by pressing the refresh button on the tab and see if that same message pops up.\nIf so, then this message will also pop up when the tab tries to suspend. If you check the 'never suspend tabs with unsaved form inputs' option, this tab should be prevented from automatically suspending if you have typed something into it.\nDoes that clear things up?. I'm really sorry to hear this. The extension should have restored all your tabs from your last session. There are a couple of others having this same issue. I'm trying to get to the bottom of it now: #526\nOnce again, I'm really sorry. I know how much of a pain this can be.. @K0media Thanks for this suggestion. You are correct that the technical hurdle of github might prevent some people from contributing. Although if you are just looking at providing a Brazilian Portuguese translation, it would be fairly simple. All you need to do is copy this file: \nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/blob/master/src/_locales/en/messages.json\nand change the english text into Brazilian Portuguese. You can simply paste your translated version as a comment into this issue if you want, and I can do the technical bit.\nA Brazilian Portuguese translation would be great!\n. Just to provide context to this (as per issue #891):\nPrior to extension update, the OP had multiple windows open across multiple mac OSX desktops/spaces. When the extension updated, because there was no unsuspended tabs in these windows, the entire windows were closed.\nWhen the extension tried to recover these windows, it was unable to get information about which desktop/space the original window was in, and in addition, it cloned the dimensions of the currently open window for all the new windows.\nA proposed solution for this could be to check for this situation prior to updating. For any windows detected that contain only suspended tabs, the extension could unsuspend onle the active tab in each of the windows before forcing the update. Thus, none of the windows would entirely close, and the update could restore the tabs into the existing windows, which would remain in their correct desktop/space and with the correct dimensions.. @bdickhaus I'm sorry that the update caused you issues. I can assure you it has been tested very thoroughly. But there is obviously some cases that I have not anticipated. I'd love to get to the bottom of what has caused the issue for you.\nWhat do you see if you go to the extensions' options screen and then click on session management? Did it save a backup of the session before the update? This is the session it uses to recover your tabs after the update. Are you saying that this only contains 3 windows out of the 6? This is unusual. Most people that have this issue have no entries in their session history at all.\nPerhaps the other 3 windows belonged to a different chrome profile? Maybe that also updated the extension, but completely failed? \nAny extra information you could provide would be very useful.\nThanks.. Why do you check if the element in in a body tag? Does it matter?. Hmmm yeah, this is an interesting one actually. It's like this to mimic the 'Open Link in New Tab' text in the native chrome right-click menu. And this option should never appear side-to-side with the other options. If you right-click on a link, this is the only option that shows.\nSee screenshot for an example:\n\n. @MonsterNya This option will discard tabs AFTER they have been suspended. So it CAN discard suspended tabs. When you revisit one of the suspended discarded tabs, it will undiscard automatically, showing the suspended tab in it's place. This is where you get the rendering delay.. \n. If you open the extension settings page, and change the url from options.html to updated.html you'll see this screen. \nThe ...line2_prefix text is for the text before the 'session management' link.\nThe ...line2_suffix text is for after that link.. Ahh, the html_suspended_modal has been removed. You can probably ignore these ones. I'll try to remove these old translations once we've merged your PR.. Suspending selected tabs via the rightclick context menu works fine for me?\nIf I select multiple tabs (by holding down cmd and clicking the tab favicons) and then right click somewhere on the page of the currently focused tab, I get the TGS context menu. This does NOT unselect my tabs. And when I choose 'Suspend selected tabs' this suspends all the tabs I had highlighted.. It's essentially a css issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5078239/how-do-i-remove-the-space-between-inline-block-elements\nthe fix is to put all the html on a single line. don't worry about it here..

    "phresno": "Sure, I'll report back any issues after the update is out.\n. It does seem to fix the issue, though manually having people update their copies is not practical.\n. ",
    "parkour86": "I believe this is fixed now.

If your still having problems I can walk you through the steps to fix it manually. It's very easy.\n. My extensions updated automatically when I opened my Chrome browser this morning. Did a google search and  I don't think there's a way to prevent that.\n. Is there anyway you can warn us of when the next update is coming in advanced through the extension? Maybe have a note/date added to our suspended tabs? One way of doing it is maybe when we suspend a tab it will download a basic text file from github and displayed on the suspended tabs. That way you can just modify the file on github and it warns everyone when an update is coming.\n. ",
    "mohanraj-r": "Just a thought: I am not sure if chrome allows communication between extensions or detecting if other extensions are installed.. but if it does, it would be great if this extension could detect if session buddy is installed and use it to save/restore sessions during the update process.\nEven otherwise, wouldn't the following be simpler during a update process:\n1. Get list of suspended tabs per windows\n2. Reload them (bring out of suspension)\n3. Perform update\n4. Suspend the tabs with information from step 1 \nI would say that 4 (and 1) can be skipped if hard to do. I would rather have my session / tab / windows undisturbed during the update. Bringing the tabs out of suspension during an update would be the least disruptive option for me. After update - I can manually suspend them again or rely on the automatic suspension after timeout.\n. This might become easier as chrome might be getting a related feature and hopefully API in the near future:\nGoogle Chrome Getting Audio Indicators for Tabs Making Sound\n. I can confirm this too. I think this started happening after chrome updated to Version 25.0.1364.152. I don't think the extension was updated in the past week. Not sure why this is happening - I didn't have such problems a week back. If I can help by running a debug version and submit stats, I am willing to do so. I had to disable the extension to stop chrome from crashing. \n. Some updates on this issue:\nUpdated chrome to Version 25.0.1364.160 m\nSet tabs to be auto-suspended after 30 mins. Approx after 30 mins, chrome crashed (without any warning).\nReopened chrome and clicked restore session when Chrome prompted. No suspended tabs. Maybe the crash happened during the process of suspension. Thought that maybe auto-suspending multiple tabs simultaneously could be causing this.\nMade sure the auto-suspend time is set to 'Never'.\nManually suspended about 5 tabs (out of total about 30 tabs).\nCouple of minutes later, chrome crashed (with a warning).\nLeaving the extension installed with auto-suspension disabled and no suspended tabs doesn't result in a crash. \nSo I guess it is something what happens during the process of suspension that is the culprit.\nI guess this is obvious and you could have figured it already.\nNevertheless, wanted to log my observations in case it helped.\nopened chrome://flags/\nand enabled\n1. Check for known conflicts with 3rd-party modules\n2. Script Bubble\nBut it hasn't helped.\n. Yes, I have screen capturing turned on.\nI am facing this issue on my work machine: Win 7 64 bit.\nComing to think about it - I am not sure if the Chrome in my home machine running Linux has similar issues. I will have to check the version of chrome on it. Will check and post.\n. I tried the same steps as above (in my Windows machine) after turning off screen capturing. And both manual and automatic suspension work! without crashing the browser.\nHope that it is the problem - and if it is - glad that we have a temporary fix.\nBut screen capture was one of the distinguishing features I liked about this extension and made it stand out from all the other similar extensions. Would be great to bring it back. Can't we use other libraries/projects to accomplish this e.g. https://code.google.com/p/chrome-screen-capture\n. ",
    "tgryffyn": "I know this is closed, but I came to request the same thing (warning and/or Session Buddy auto-save before updating).\nI just started using TGS and it's almost exactly what I was looking for and very happy I didn't have to write my own app to do this :)   I have a habit of having 100 tabs open at once.  I'm getting better at managing them, but they still end up taking up a lot of resources even when I keep it down to 50 or so.  So TGS has worked great so far.\nBut the last two updates to the extension have been a little rough.  Both times I end up with just one tab for each window I had open, which kind of sucks but I understand that you can't really unsuspend so many tabs, then do the update, etc...  the first time, I was able to use the list of suspended tabs and reopen them.  This last time, there was no list at all.  Clicking \"show history\" did nothing as well.\nAt home, I had to go back to a Session Buddy auto-save from 10 days ago.  At work I was a little luckier and had one from 2 days ago.\nI rarely close my browser unless I'm doing a full system restart, so each time it was with the browser open (in Windows).  I think Chrome might wait for inactivity and slip updates in while you're not using the system.  I use Secunia PSI to scan my apps periodically and let me know if any need updating and it pops up with \"Changes in Chrome found. Chrome was updated.\" sometimes even if I don't restart Chrome, but maybe have been away from it for a while.\nAnyway, I didn't lose any work or anything... worst that I lost are some articles I hadn't read yet but no big deal.  But having some kind of option to back up the current tab list (in Session Buddy or Tabs Outliner.. another great tab management addon...  or somewhere) would be great.\nThanks for the great extension!  It's a lifesaver!   I didn't see a Donate button anywhere... did I miss it?\n. No worries on the technical hurdles.  It's a small price to pay for the functionality.  \nI guess it's Chrome that closes the tabs when it updates the extension, especially since the tabs show up under one extension if you look at Chrome's task manager.  And since it's in the  Chrome store, I guess just publishing an update there will autoupdate it on browsers.  If I recall, the Chrome extension manifest has a thing for an autoupdate URL but like I said, I assume if you're not hosting it yourself, the Chrome store will do the autoupdate regardless of what you set in the manifest.\nSo this last update (4.74) had my browser at home only show a handful of tabs on the \"updated\" page.  Not as many as I had.  And the one at work had nothing showing.\nI'm not sure about work, but at home here, I do have a history.  I assume the TGS history is only tabs that were suspended at the time that the extension restarted?  The history shows various dates, but only a few tabs in each, not all the tabs that were open in general.  But at least this last time, more than just the tabs listed were closed.  There's really not much else to it than that.\nAnyway, just wanted to report it in case it helped identify a problem sooner.  Like I said, I'm very happy with how the extension is working now and assuming it doesn't take a turn for the worse and never recover, I'm on board. hah\nAs for a donate button... well, it'll never be \"perfect\" and any programmer/artist/whatever who thinks their stuff is perfect are usually crappy at what they do.  The people who are never happy with their stuff, that's who usually cranks out the best stuff.   So shoot for perfect, but don't wait for perfect to put up a donate button.  It's already \"useful\" and that's valuable.\n. ",
    "liamjohnston": "Agree that 2-click tab suspending is not optimal for some users.

Other than that, I pretty much use the default settings!

I am one of the many devs looking to make the move to Firefox, and my use of (and involvement in) TGS is one of the main things holding me back. . I wonder if what is actually happening is that the tab has been 'discarded' (Chrome's native equivalent of tab suspension, which it will do when system memory is low). Visiting a discarded tab will automatically reload it, which you may be mistaking for a suspended tab unsuspending. \nI'm unsure if suspended tabs can be discarded currently, but if so then this is a possible explanation. \nJust a theory though \ud83d\ude2c.

I can assure you that this is not an elaborate hoax :). @bhuvidya Exactly. A real dick move, whether they knew it or not.. @dragonspirit1185 Open source software is essentially outsourced by definition. Either fix the problem yourself (as a pull request) or find someone else who can. \n\n@adcurtin is right; your comments were unhelpful an inappropriate. The developer is doing everything he can to avoid this not-completely-avoidable problem.. @rxbasu Just to double-check - you're looking on this page right? chrome://extensions/\n(and not just going off which icons are visible next to the address bar). Duplicate of #519 \nIt now seems that some people like it the way it worked before, while in the past others had requested it work the way it works now. \nThe current behaviour is the intended behaviour. Personally I feel the current behaviour is better (leaving suspended tabs suspended if they aren't explicitly focused). If you felt strongly you could add a feature request to make this behaviour configurable I guess?. It looks like this may not be specific to TGS. Lots of other people with the same issue with your setup and chrome extensions generally:\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/tyzywUJfkQI\nSeems like a Chrome issue.\nThere are some workarounds in that thread.. Also tracked in Chromium here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=659642. @volt55 The Great Discarder is by the same developer. It has a similar UI.\nThe key difference is that it uses the API for chrome's in-built discarding functionality (which was actually inspired to some degree by The Great Suspender - you can read about that here: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/09/tab-discarding#inspiration_hey_there_great_suspender )\nDiscarder gives you less functionality. For instance, you can't 'view' a discarded tab in its 'click to reload' state, as viewing a tab un-discards it. That's just a limitation of the API. There are other feature limitations compared to The Great Suspender, I can't recall all of them right now.\nSo for most people, switching to Discarder would be a bit disappointing.\nThere is a new version of TGS one of these days, sit tight... :). The only advantage TGD has over TGS that I know of is that it makes use of chrome API for the exact purpose. Which I guess means it's less likely to stop working in a Chrome update for instance. Though given how many Chome staffers rely on TGS to keep their Chromebooks running, I don't see it breaking any time soon \ud83d\ude0e \nTGS is totally bespoke. TGS's concept of suspending is just 'OK this has been open a while (or whatever your rules are), navigate to some URL that basically stores the proper URL, so we know where to go when you unsuspend it'. Or something like that.\nChrome's native discarding I believe looks at actual system CPU usage - when it gets low, it 'discards' the tab, which is similar to suspending. I.e. it removes what it can from memory, then when the tab is viewed, it reloads it (possibly quicker than a full page refresh would be?). TGD gives you SOME control over when/how things get discarded.\nI can't quite recall the functionality differences between TGS and TGD - install TGD, have a look at the settings page, and that question will be answered. But TGD is less feature-rich.\n  . @volt55 I never said TGD's discarded tabs use less memory than TGS's suspended tabs. I have no idea, but if I had to take a guess I'd maybe think TGS's tabs use less memory. But I don't know. Also it may well differ based on the content of the tab and other factors. The developer probably has a better idea.. @volt55 The main differences are a) functionality (TGS has more) and that TGD uses new chrome functionality to do its suspending (discarding). \nI don't know any more than that, e.g. performance / memory usage.. You can - they're completely different extensions with no knowledge of each other. You can even have different of TGS running concurrently (e.g. the webstore version and a dev version).\nBUT I wouldn't recommend it. Might do weird stuff.. @fenixnet-net \nMy understanding s that it's been fixed, on master.\nThe process of updating the extension on the webstore is extremely painful in that everyone will lose all of their suspended tabs. See #526. With well over 1m users that's a lot of lost tabs and a lot of unhappy people. The author is rightly being careful not to release this fix willy nilly. It will happen. In the meantime, try out master? Unsuspend or backup your tabs first.. @mbpakalin Nope. A quick glance at the commit history will show it is actively being worked on. \nAs for why the chrome webstore version hasn't been updated lately, see https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526 ... an update is coming at some stage.. @log0ymxm The extension is actively maintained. See #526 for an explanation of why the webstore version is not getting frequent updates.\n@deanoemcke I suggest we close this issue.... @Boscop Yeah, what @fwextensions said. There's no way to not get an update of a chrome extension once it's available to you. This is true of all chrome extensions AFAIK.\nThere's also no guarantee that the update won't nuke your tabs or cause other weird behaviour (e.g. ordering of tabs changing). The vast majority of users will not experience these issues, but some people have and will. It's a problem that's tricky to avoid and is well documented in this repo.\nMy recommendation is to continue to use the web store version but have a tab backup system in place using another chrome extension, e.g. \"Tabs Backup and Restore\". That's not an official endorsement, I've never used it :)\nIf you're not OK with the risks associated with automatic chrome web store updates, you can run a dev version of the extension instead, and then only update it if/when you want to. Instructions to 'install as an extension from source' can be found here here:\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender#install-as-an-extension-from-source. @Boscop I believe that's the one others have recommended, yeah. I haven't had the need for it so I don't know. \nAs for whether it backs up suspended tabs, you'd need to experiment. Or someone else here may know more \ud83d\ude0a. Most chrome extensions don't do what The Great Suspender does, @dragonspirit1185 \nThe gsScrollPos cookie bug was very serious. Only the very tech savvy would be able to find out how to fix it. And it was a pain for those people to have to continually fix it.\nThe issues you've experienced with the extension updating do not effect most people, and only occur when the extension updates. Though @deanoemcke has made updating less prone to failure, there's always going to be some risk. Updates will be kept top a minimum because of this, but be aware that the current webstore version is not the final version. There are more bugfixes to come that have come out of this partial rollout. \nIf you don't want to get unexpected updates, follow my suggestions further up:\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537#issuecomment-417828499. @bro3234 it shouldn't cause you to lose tabs, but there's a chance. This is why IMO you're best to wait until the next (hopefully final for a while) version is released and makes it to you, to save going through the update process more times than necessary. . It's fixed in the current dev version, AND the latest web store version. However, most people aren't on the latest web store version yet because the rollout isn't complete. The dev wants to iron out the last of the major issues (and test) before rolling out to all users.\nIf you don't want to wait: you can uninstall and reinstall the program extension from the web store to get the latest version with this fix. However be sure to unsuspend or backup all suspended tabs first, or they'll disappear when you uninstall. . @krisdahl Unfortunately there isn't a way to communicate with people. There's some 'update warning' functionality like this built into the new version, but there's still no guarantee people will see/read it before the update happens. And people on the old (6.x) verison won't see this on their next update. The vast majority of TGS users are normal webstore folks, not Github lurkers. \nOnly a small percentage of people experience tab loss during an update. The last webstore update was only updated for 5% of webstore users as a trial. But a small percentage of 5% of 1.5m people is still a lot of people, and so it still turns into a shitstorm. \nI understand it's frustrating but, but there's a lot of responsibility on the dev's shoulders and it this isn't his full time job. Please bear with us.. Done. That's a valid concern but it's the only way to fix it that we know of. Plus if it does fall over one day, the worst that should happen is missing favicons. And it should be easy to fix.. I like what you've done here. \nOnly thing in my testing of it, I think #eee works a little better than white for .dark #gsTopBar, I found white a little harsh. Thoughts?. It's also very different from the existing dark theme, I wonder if it warrants a third option, 'Really dark' :). Looks like a duplicate of #541? That's been fixed, though I'm not sure if that fix has made it to the webstore yet (@deanoemcke?). Even if it has, automatic updates are off so you'r need to re-install the extension (back up your suspended tabs first!).. @legierski \nDid you update on the chrome webstore? That's not been updated yet. And even when it is updated, automatic updates are (and always will be) disabled.\nIf you updated via the git repo, that's a bit weird and should have worked... can you confirm?. Also, once you've established that you're running the correct version of the code, can you go here and tell me if it looks blurry/pixelated:\nchrome://favicon/size/16@2x/https://stripe.com/gb\n(yes I have committed the internet's favicons to memory). @legierski Did you follow the instructions for \"Install as an extension from source\" from here?\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender\nThe main gotcha is step 4, make sure you select the src directory. Good luck...\nI believe @deanoemcke plans to get the retina-friendly version onto the webstore soon-ish.\nAlso how does this look:\nchrome://favicon/size/16@2x/https://stripe.com/gb\nPixelated or not?. Hmm, that's a worry.\nI guess just one more thing I want to check: That gmail tab, did you suspended it after installing the latest github version of TGS (and using that version - i.e. you don't still also have the webstore version installed)? \nAlso, can you check one more for me please?:\nchrome://favicon/size/16@2x/https://stackoverflow.com/\nNote I'm interested in the favicon that appears in the tab's body, not the tab itself (as in your previous screenshot). I.e something like this:\n\nThanks!. This is really weird. I've just checked master and it looks like there were a couple of changes that were missing (bad merge maybe?). I've just committed these to master - can you update your code and take another look? Not 100% sure this will fix your issue though, seeing as I couldn't replicate your issue with supposedly the same code.\nAlso, if your issue is still unresolved after updating, can you tell me how the favicon on a suspended tab body looks? I.e. the bit in the grey bar. This is how github master version looks like for me:\n\nvs how the webstore version currently looks:\n\n(needs to be a website that actually serves a retina-friendly favion e.g. stackoverflow or codepen). @baz357 Think of it as \"whitelist for this session\" (which could be a better label...).

Interesting. Do you get this issue on any other sites?\n\nI'm using the 'system font stack' that's kinda hot right now:\nfont-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,\"Helvetica Neue\",sans-serif;\nI like it because you a get nice font without having to download any webfonts. It has a fallback of 'sans-serif' so I'd expect something to show.. Well, GitHub.com for one. Some info and examples here:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/\nThe fact that you're not seeing this issue on other sites makes me think it could be a caching issue. One of the new changes is changing to this font stack from a locally served web font (Open Sans) so maybe your browser is still looking for that font? Weird that there'd be no visible fallback though in either case :/\nCan you inspect the text and see what font it's trying to load? And look at the computed styles? And add an inline style via the inspector, e.g. font-family: sans-serif;, and see if that makes the text appear? Thanks!. Sheesh, I don't see how TGS could be responsible for logging your users out \ud83d\ude10\nCan you do some more tests?? E.g. leave TGS off for a while longer and see if it happens again, and if not, re-enable it and see if it happens again?\nI have an MBP and use fast user switching (both profiles use TGS) and have not seen this issue.. fwextensions, I'm using a system font stack similar (or identical?) to what GitHub uses, as well as some other well known/liked sites. I was inspired by this post: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/\n(TGS uses the second snippet under 'Method 1').\nI'm more concerned with it looking 'good' than looking identical across OSes.. Thanks for the tip, @fwextensions. I hadn't seen that update. I have made that change \ud83e\udd19 . \ud83d\ude44 \ud83d\ude44 \ud83d\ude44 \ud83d\ude44 \ud83d\ude44 \ud83d\ude44 \ud83d\ude44 \nThanks, I have updated the stack to what GitHub uses now \ud83d\ude2c . @fwextensions The lack of an 'Unsuspend' option is intentional. We didn't think anyone would try to unsuspend via the popup given you can click anywhere on the suspended tab to do it (or set a keyboard shortcut, or refresh the tab).\nA grey icon means that the current tab will not suspend for some reason. There are lots of possible reasons, including:\n- it's already suspended\n- it's whitelisted\n- it's receiving form input\n- it's a 'chrome' tab (not sure what these are better known as, sorry), e.g. TGS settings page, Chrome preferences tab, downloads tab (chrome://downloads/) etc.\nThere's a known bug where sometimes if you open a tab that can't be suspended, the TGS icon is coloured, and only changes to grey if you switch tabs then switch back.. There is a delay. I can't remember how long exactly, but it is by design (AND was requested by other GitHub users I'm pretty sure). Reason being: a very brief focus doesn't necessarily imply intention to view the tab. \nFor instance: I often switch between tabs with my arrow keys (cmd + option + left/right), skipping over one or two suspended tabs to get to another tab. I'm not interested in those skipped suspended tabs so they should stay suspended. \nHow long would you say it's taking before it appears to start reloading? Perhaps we could look at adjusting this. I think no more than 1 second should be about right for the 'keyboard tabbing' scenario above. . On that last part, see https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/519. I use the heck out of 'Don't suspend for now'.\nCommon use case: On a video site like Udemy, where I am in the middle of a long video, which I pause to come back to later and not lose my place. But I also want that site to auto-suspend other times (e.g. when I'm between videos).\nI suspect other users of this feature would use it for the same reason - anyone? \nI'm perfectly happy with how it works currently, though having it keep working through a browser restart would be even better. I hardly ever restart though so I don't really care personally.. I am guessing you're on an old version of chrome. The blue dot feature was removed. \nThis was all I could fine about it:\nhttps://support.google.com/chrome/forum/AAAAP1KN0B05jUw-e8nCg0/?hl=en. Oh, OK. My bad. \nI have never actually seen the blue dot, though I don't tend to pin tabs.\nIf my understanding of the dot is correct - that it appears when something(??) about the tab has changed - I'm don't think this extension would have the ability to not show it.. See https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526 for an explanation.. There's  screenshot capturing option in the settings. Disabled by default. . @rickhg12hs The latest master version can do this. So either hang out for the next webstore release (not sure when this will be.... hopefully soon) or install the latest master from source. \nInstructions here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender#install-as-an-extension-from-source\nMake sure you unsuspend tabs before disabling whatever version you currently use! Or they'll be lost.. @nemanjaglumac It's more 'responsive' than it used to be, but yeah - extensions don't work on mobile so it isn't really a concern :)\nI miss the save button... we had one way back when. Maybe one day I'll convince Dean to put it back :) Mind you, the 'dark' theme only applies to the suspended tabs, not the settings or other pages. . @shanedrgn It's @deanoemcke's call, but it gets a big thumbs up and a hearty 'Well done' from me :D I've been wanting this feature but hadn't done anything toward making that happen...\nMy only suggestion is this: I don't believe this should be a configurable setting (in the settings screen). It should just always behave this way. I want to keep the settings to a minimum, only adding settings where there isn't a clear better default. Are you happy to make this change? It looks like that would just mean removing some of the code you added.. As a workaround, you can head to the settings page and change the 'automatically suspend' dropdown option to 'never'. There's already the option to suspend all (or is it 'other'?) tabs - have you tried this? Still a manual process of course, but you don't need to do it on every tab.. @CollinChaffin This is actually great, and very timely feedback. We're just trying to lock down what the dark theme should look like. I'm not a 'dark theme guy' so it's good to hear from some real night folks. Will opt for darker! Thanks :). @JonnyRedHed It's on the 'maybe to do one day' list. It's a nice idea in that it gives you instant feedback of what it might look like. BUT the settings pages aren't really for every-day use, so didn't think it super beneficial for the effort in coming up with something that looks good slash all the extra code.\nThough the dropdown is a more common (every day) use case... I'll have a play with this idea.. How about allowing tabs with form data to be suspended? That's a setting, right? Not ideal, but if the setting is doing more harm than good you could switch it as a sort of workaround for now. . Can you be more specific about what happens exactly? \nThe way you make it sound, you're on tab A and then suddenly get taken to tab B when tab B automatically suspends. \nThe only time I've seen unexpected tab switching is if a tab tries to auto-suspend but has some sort of unfinished-form alert like this:\n\n(^ which I think is a good thing personally)\nEdit: Related gitHub issue for the unfinished-form alert: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/272. Hi @UZR2000 \nIs this what you're looking for?\n\nIt's available in the latest github version (not yet in the chrome web store). Instructions for using a dev extension are here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender#install-as-an-extension-from-source\nYou'l probably not want to have two versions of the extension running at the same time, so maybe also disable your current version of the extension while you're at it. BUT MAKE SURE YOU UN-SUSPEND YOUR TABS FIRST if you don't want to lost them.\n. Not so bad \ud83d\ude0a could have a bigger line height I guess but probably not\nworth the trouble.\nOn Wed, Oct 10, 2018, 5:45 PM Dean Oemcke notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAnd while we're talking about text wrapping on the popup menu, here's the\nrussian version (on OSX)\n[image: image]\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1051763/46713654-ca054780-cc25-11e8-853e-72455e5ec829.png\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/727#issuecomment-428436325,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABFQeWd4M6bj5OfJVRkK3sNFt2THiTElks5ujXtvgaJpZM4WKtjg\n.\n. @fwextensions Yup, that's exactly what should happen - tabs that were suspended before update should still be suspended after the update (after they disappear and come back).. @fwextensions two things:\n\n\n\nCould you also provide screenshots of a suspended tab and the options popup? The text in the screenshot is of the settings checkbox options - which is just about the smallest in TGS (14px). So I'm wondering if the solution could be to bump it up instead of changing the weights.\n\n\nWould you mind taking a look at this branch and telling me what you think of the legibility? On the suspended tab, popup and settings section. I'd appreciate it :)\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/tree/fix/text-legibility\n\n\nBasically I removed any instances of less-than-normal font weights. \nWould be good to test this on some other OSes and screens, but I don't have the setup for that :/\nThe fonts looked great on my screen already (retina MBP, San Fransisco font I think?), but it's not worse with this change I don't think... or if it is, it's negligible.\nThanks!. Thanks heaps for the screenshots \ud83d\udc4d I've a changes to only render the light-weight font on high-dpi screens :) It's on the latest master now.. Note - I'm pretty sure the 'Update' button only appears if you have developer mode turned on.. To be clear (as this may not have actually been mentioned anywhere): the new version is currently being rolled out gradually. Only about 10% of users currently. \nThis is so we can catch any issues early before hitting all 1.4m with those issues.\nThe only way currently to guarantee getting the new version is to remove and reinstall from the web store. \nAs for why the same profile on different computers isn't getting the same version, I guess this might just be a limitation of Chrome's extension update functionality. The user targeting functionality does seem pretty basic.\nFor instance:\nWhen uploading a new version to the web store, you can set a % of users to get a new version (e.g. 5%). \nBut then when you want to release a hotfix or update, there's no way to target that same 5% of users. There'll be some overlap, but not a lot.\nMy expectation was that it would be based on Chrome profiles. But that would appear not to be the case. I guess you don't even have to have a profile set up to use Chrome (and probably a massive portion of Chrome users don't).. i'll just leave this here\n\n. The latest version(s) have this. See 'not now':\n\nYou can also set a keyboard shortcut for it (mine is command + shift + D). It's pretty adorable \u2764\ufe0f Great job.\nI'm slightly concerned with the performance impact though. Not so much the 1K size, but the effort in animating it continually across hundreds of tabs. I reckon the performance issues we had with the initial 7.x release were related to the fact that I had that loading spinner on the page, continually spinning - even when hidden (with opacity I think :/ ). There were other CSS optimisations we needed to make to fix this, but I reckon the continual animation was a culprit. This is just a theory though.\nAre you able to establish whether or not this would be an issue? I would be keen to know your findings if you were to implement this with hundreds of suspended tabs. Also there might be an elegant way to not apply the animations on non-focussed tabs.\nThere's also the perceived bloat issue that slightly worries me. Like, people thinking the inactive tab is doing too much and using more memory than it needs to. \nA little while back I made a more animated version of snoozy, but it was a 'waking' animation. It did some sleepy blinking before properly opening its mouth and eyes. The problem with that was that some tabs would finish unsuspending part-way through the animation, which was annoying. This approach to animating does away with that issue nicely.. Thanks @fwextensions \nOut of interest, is this a real browser size you've been using? Or just seeing what would happen to the suspended tab at small resolutions?\nLooking at the browser sizes in our analytics, I'm seeing that practically no one browses at the <~450px height required for this bug to occur. \nSo probably labelling this as a won't fix unless some more pressure mounts up :D. Ah, I just spied your PR for this.\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/751\nThanks for the fix. I'm still hesitant about this - it's adding extra 10 lines of code (plus more to fix the spinner placement issue). After the fallout from the initial 7.x release CSS performance issues, I'm keen to avoid too much unneeded code. \n@deanoemcke thoughts...?. The z-index one-liner seems the best solution to me, in terms of helping a very uncommon situation with minimal performance impact or testing required.\nz-index: 101; (I know) on .gsTopBar does the job nicely.. Feel free to make it the change I suggested instead - and I'll merge it in. Up to you :)\nHave you tried flexbox zombies? It's free and fun, and made me memorise flexbox, which I'd previously have to google every time.. See my comment here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/750. It's probably an opera thing. It hasn't really been thoroughly tested outside of chrome (firefox a little bit). Making it officially compatible with other browsers is a feature that is likely to come at some stage though, and this clickability issue would be addressed. . I'd rather not move or change it.\nAs a workaround, you can set a shortcut. This will stop it being a clickable link. You don't have to actually use the keyboard shortcut \ud83d\ude0a. The gradual rollout is paused while some last fixes are being made/tested. You will get the update automatically once the rollout is done. . 'Continue where i left off' is not the default setting. So it's highly a lot (maybe most) TGS users don't have that setting on.\nAwesome that you have a fix though! \ud83d\udc4f . The rollout of \"automatic updates\" of the new version is rolling out gradually. You can keep waiting and you'll get it once it rolls out to 100% of people. Otherwise you can uninstall it completely and reinstall from the web store, BUT if you do that, make sure you unsuspend your tabs first and make a backup of your whitelist.. Happens to me too sometimes on latest/recent dev versions. . This PR resolves it:\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/799. Yep, this is expected and unfortunately unavoidable. Suspended tabs 'belong' to the extension, so when the extension goes, so do the tabs.\nThere's no hook the extension can use when someone attempts to remove it. As you could imagine, this would probably get abused by some extension developers (think nag screens etc).\nAs for the update - the new version is still being rolled out to only a percentage of users, until it's been fully tested and battle-hardened and that percentage is increased to 100%. No amount of hitting refresh will get you the new version. The only way is to remove it and re-add it (which you did) :). Thanks for the screenshot. Which version are you on? I thought I'd resolved this (in a more recent version than the web store version) . This exists. See \"not now\" option below. You can also set a keyboard shortcut for it if you wish :)\n\n. First of all, if you don't like the extension, don't use it. \nHave you tried the latest dev build? Not on the chrome store yet. Has some performance improvements.. Good call. This extension actually us used in other browsers too, though that's not common.perhaps if your PR also did some browser sniffing to fallback to png if it isn't chrome? . Can you provide more info?\nAssuming you want this extension to block/warn or otherwise handle detecting you trying to open/suspend a url that is already open/suspended in a other tab... I would say that's not really in the remit of The Great Suspender. \nI'm guessing there are already other extensions that do this already? Not sure if they handle tabs managed by this extension (suspended tabs), but I reckon they would, assuming the suspended urls are the same. . Pretty sure the functionality would be severely limited if you used about:blank.\nFor instance, retaining the tab title, the favicon, screenshot (for people that use this option)... You'd save memory, but probably miss out on every other feature of the extension I'm guessing.\nSo yeah, big difference. @deanoemcke correct me if I'm wrong.\nChrome extensions can access/control the about:blank page, but I'm not sure this extension should do this.. Are you wanting to use this via some corporate 'group policy'? That's not 'officially supported' but others have managed to do it. See here:\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/456\nOr do you just not want your colleagues to see the snoozy tab (aka the boombox)? If so, you could enable screenshot mode instead. It will likely use more memory than than with screenshot mode disabled, but if you don't have too many suspended tabs it should be fine.. Also related:\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/809\nAdding a setting to not show that image would probably relatively simple, as you say. But ease of development is not what dictates what gets added :). Use screen capture mode, see the settings section. . Yep, @deanoemcke is spot on. I've not been following this PR/thread fully but if we're talking about \u0435 appearing instead of \u0451 in an edge case, this is acceptable. \nThe font stack we use looks good in all operating systems with zero cost (i.e. no loading of web fonts), and I don't think this should change if we can help it. Especially if it's an issue with the font rather than our issue.. That spacing in your screenshot @MonsterNya is in deed weird and bad. \nMine looks like this (I'm on a mac too):\n\n(i.e. it looks as it's supposed to)\nPersonally, I sort of feel like adding a + between each character would make it look a bit busy without any usability gain. I don't hate it with the +, but I don't think it's quite as good.\nDefinitely need to get to the bottom of your spacing bug though! I gotta find a windows machine to test on.... Oh man, it's so obvious now \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I guess I'd have figured that out pretty quickly if I'd inspected it on windows. \nSo what's your fix, @deanoemcke? Remove pletter spacing and wrap each 'key' in a s with left/right margins? Want a hand?. On first impression I don't love the middle dot \ud83d\ude2c But maybe I could learn to. \nI have a (only slight) preference for spacing, e.g. &nbsp;&nbsp; (two spaces). Like-a this:\n\nBut no biggie either way :)\n. How about a single space, then a word-spacing on the parent, e.g. word-spacing: 2px;?. FWIW I thought that first screenshot in your last comment looks fine \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f But if you don't think so, go with spaced dots. No biggie from my perspective :). OK, the dots (with space) have it. Good call @Jollfye on updating the settings page.. Which version are you on? This bug has been fixed recently on master. . It sounds like you're using the webstore version. \nThe latest version is v7.0.171. It includes heaps of performance improvements and bugfixes. It will be pushed to the webstore once @deanoemcke is happy it's stable. IN the meantime you can either live with the bug or switch to using a dev version (I'd suggest just waiting :)). @Quenz yes, I've been thinking we should add this. Keen to keep new non-critical features out of the upcoming next release, but maybe I'll make a PR next time I get the chance \ud83d\ude0a\nI'm thinking it should be a third option in the theme dropdown, like \"system setting\" (or similar). We'd make it the default for those who currently have the default \"light\" set.\n@deanoemcke Sound good? . @Quenz \nPR is here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/pull/888\nWe're putting this on ice until Chrome ~v75 is out. \nChrome v73 only adds support for Chrome itself to use on its tab bar etc, and doesn't provide access to the CSS media query (or JS matchMedia).. If possible we should make 'system' the default setting, unless a user has already set their TGS preference to 'dark'. Chrome. I was under the impressing Chrome 73 supports it... . Ah, I read that page but only scanned it. Sure enough, the browser chrome (tab bar) respects the system theme but the media query support is not yet there. This code should work but we should wait till it can be properly tested. In the meantime we can work on getting decent translations for \"use system setting\" \ud83d\ude0a. @Quenz Hmm, gave it a go in Canary (v75) with no luck. Looking at caniuse, it seems still a ways off. \nhttps://caniuse.com/#search=prefers-color-scheme\nFirefox Nightly is the only browser I can find that supports it.... but given this is primarily a Chrome extension, that isn't much good to me.. I don't see how this extension could be responsible for windows appearing in the wrong desktop/space or the window size not being what you want. To me these seem more like general Chrome relaunch issues. @deanoemcke do you think it's possible TGS is to blame here?\nAre you using the web store version (as opposed to loading it via a local copy of the code)? \nIf yes: did the previous version have a different design (v6.x)? Or similar to what you have now (v7.x)?\nRegarding the bit about the extension updating \"without asking me whether it was OK\"...\nVersion 6.x had no code to be able to warn the user that an update was incoming. This has been introduced in version 7.x, so from now on if there is an update available (which will be infrequent), the extension should open a new tab letting you know and giving you a button to make the update happen when you're ready (and another option to back up your tabs). AFAIK, the update will happen at some stage if you don't make it happen manually in time. I think this might be the case with all Chrome extensions anyway.. The developer did test as thoroughly as was feasible. As explained elsewhere, there was no way to warn users of an update. The new version does include this functionality though. . Needs consistent casing (suggest sentence case). Ah. Welp, whatever. Doesn't matter a great deal.. ",

    "cauerego": "How awesome is that? A good and simple suggestion was done. 7 days later, it was implemented! ^_^\n. I think this is not the purpose here. First of all, I think it is made to be kind of messy. Using tabs as \"to do\" lists as we use is wrong / messy, to begin with, as it allocates memory. It simply tries to reduce, not deallocate memory at full. If you were more organized, unlike me who leave many tabs opens for days or months, you would simply close everything in the end of the day. And reopen in the next day what you'll use that day.\nAnyway, if you want to kill tabs, why not using Session Buddy instead? https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko\nOr if you want to close tabs, simply use any kind of bookmarking.\nI like this extension for its simplicity.

Well it's a pretty interesting test : I opened my Chrome session linked to\nanother email (by cliking on the person icon of chrome and switching to\nanother connected account), which usually didn't have this issue upon\nloading on the same machine with very few tabs openned (4) and no withelist\ntabs neither pinned tabs.\n\n\nSo I openned several tabs (<20), pinned some of them, added some of them to\nmy whitelist, and suspended the rest. All this in order to replicate the\nsituation I'm in with my other chrome account but with much less tabs in\neach state.\nThis resulted in a partial over-use of my CPU on loading this chrome :\naround 50% on 2 cores. I waited for a few minutes without change,  and\nagain, going over all the tabs manually made the CPU usage fell down to the\nlow level it was supposed to be.

    "dumblob": "This seems to be no more valid. Restoring works for me with already several versions of Vimium and the latest release of The Great Suspender.\n@deiga feel free to test it and close this issue.. I'm raising my hand for either of the options (2) and (3).\nI find the option (1) not a good one as e.g. in case of any crash or race condition (e.g. some tabs will close faster due to some hard limits in Chromium or in the operating system) this won't work.. With regards to the comment https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/136#issuecomment-62356835 of @deanoemcke , I'm raising my hand for this.. @deanoemcke I agree that it would make the user settings confusing. But the proposed solution:\n\nautomatically suspend tabs after x minutes\nOR\nsuspend all but the x most recently visited tabs\n\nhas one huge downside - namely the use case when one opens relatively quickly more tabs than N (imagine opening RSS links or just any article on Wikipedia with references, etc.). N is usually quite low (3 to 6 would be my guess), but the number of links you'd like to look at (usually just briefly - without waiting) and close is higher than this N. In this very common case you do want basically the whole batch of tabs to load and not just the last few while immediately suspending the other tabs you opened 10 seconds ago.\nSo the combination of these settings definitely makes sense. We just need to find a way how to present this to the user. My idea would be something like:\n\n[x] Suspend all tabs except for last N tabs visited.\n[x] Delay suspension by X minutes.\n[x] Never suspend pinned tabs (i.e. ignore them in N).\n[x] Never suspend tabs with URLs from the following list:\n.... Any news on this? I see the prioritised flag was removed :cry:.. I agree with the second option of @shodanx2 (because the first option doesn't make any sense to me - what matters is the activity, not the the time of initial opening of the tab).\n\nStill the whole settings page seems a bit illogical (at least for newcomers it's really confusing). What about the semantics outlined at the bottom in the comment above ?. >... I think dumblob was referring to the first option of shodanx2 not making any sense.\nYep.\n\nHow about this:\n- [ ] Tabs suspend after X minutes of inactivity\n- [ ] Keep at least N tabs unsuspended\n- [ ] Never suspend pinned tabs\n- [ ] Never suspend ... (the other 4 options)\n- [ ] Never suspend tabs with URLs from the following list\n\nSounds good to me.\nAnyway, the interpretation from @deanoemcke of the rules in the comment above:\n\nkey option 'Suspend all tabs except for last N tabs opened' suffers from the same issue as shodanx2. It implies N tabs + all the other ignored tabs, which removes the ability to specify a hard number of tabs that will actually be adhered to.\n\nis actually exactly what I wanted to express \ud83d\ude03 . It's interesting to see two opposite opinions on the very same simple thing. I personally do not want to have any hard number of tabs over all, but just for those tabs not belonging to any of the selected special groups (special groups are: pinned tabs, tabs with input forms, tabs with audio/video, ...). Therefore I dare to propose a refined version of the rules supporting both semantics:\n\n[ ] Suspend all tabs except for last INTEGER_FIELD tabs visited.\n[ ] Delay suspension by INTEGER_FIELD minutes.\n[ ] Never count pinned tabs in the last tabs visited.\n[ ] Never suspend pinned tabs.\n[ ] Never count ... 4 options, each accompanied with a corresponding \"Never suspend ...\"\n[ ] Never count tabs with URLs from the list below in the last tabs visited.\n[ ] Never suspend tabs with URLs from the following list:\n.... Any news on this? I forgot to say, that the current version of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/136#issuecomment-338864039 from @supersaiyansubtlety describes exactly the behavior I expect :wink:.. >The question is, is there one specific behaviors that people can agree on as being \"the best\" and can be described to the user succinctly but clearly, or is there a way to enable the user to get the behavior they want or expect in a manor that isn't overly complicated.\n\nAs you @zeel01 yourself wrote, we all have different ideas and wildly different use cases. So a one size fits all solution is not an option in my opinion (after all we have actually already a one size fits all solution for suspension implemented, but this proposal is about extending the current behavior.\nOne more try from my side how to make the settings easy to grasp as I see the above described approach of \"fine filtering/pruning of all possible cases\" (i.e. blacklisting) seems not being the way to go. What about the opposite approach (i.e. whitelisting/triggering)? I can imagine a user can define a trigger with a corresponding condition assembled as a logical expression (e.g. in the form of a tree with leafs being the atomic conditions or their negations and nodes being the AND or OR logical operators).\nThe following settings relate to each tab independently\nEmit the on_timer event after N seconds of missing user interaction.\nSuspend if any of these events occur: on_AC, on_battery, on_timer\nbut only if these conditions are met: ! tab_active AND ! is_pinned AND ! has_unsaved_form_data AND ! playing_audio_video AND ! in_whitelist AND 'M' is_less_than_sum_of_counts_of_unsuspended_tabs_of_any_of_these_attributes: 'is_pinned', 'has_unsaved_form_data', 'playing_audio_video', 'in_whitelist'\nWhere N and M are variables - integers from 0 to max_number_of_tabs shall be supported.. >Perhaps you could try my other extension, The Great Discarder. This uses native chrome discarding functionality rather than redirecting to a suspended page. Perhaps it will play nicer with vimium (i haven't tried it sorry).\nUnfortunately starting from Chromium 61.x there is an issue with focusing of discarded tabs. Therefore it doesn't play much nicer with Vimium/cVim :cry:.. I agree with @deanoemcke. On the other hand I'm a long term user of Vimium and this issue of keybindings not being functional is quite frustrating.\n@Swoorup, I would say adding keybindings would just bloat the extension. It totally ruins separation of concerns.\nIs it possible to somehow generally detect any other extension being present on the tab and somehow allow it's functionality? Would \"reordering\" of the extension execution sequence suffice?. @deanoemcke what do you think about this proposal? I know you're quite busy also with The Great Discarder, but still I dare to ask for your attitude to implementing this functionality which from my point of view is quite a break-through when it comes to user experience and also data usage in case one is connected through a mobile connection (which is often my case, I admit).. Raising my hand for this (currently I live with Native Lazy Tabs extension for this).. @deanoemcke unfortunately not, because in my case the main purpose is to prevent loading of hundreds of tabs after a Chromium (re)start. Without that it gets extremely slow, clunky, downloads hundreds of megabytes of data immediately (even though I won't use half of the tabs in the next few hours) and is way more prone to session loss in case something bad happens to the browser process(es) (it's not a theory - I've lost my \"tabs\" already several times before I started using Native Lazy Tabs).. @deanoemcke well, it's though the most frequent use case of mine, but curiously this issue caught my eye, because I'm very often using the workflow in which I open e.g. 60 new tabs from a search engine page and first then I'm checking what is in those tabs. And because opening the links one after another very quickly has the same effect as when I (re)start Chromium, I mentioned the restart as it's easier to comprehend.. >for this new scenario, are you aware of the right-click 'open in new suspended tab' option?\nWell, I'm using TGD (which doesn't support this option) for about two years already and forgot about this option in TGS. Thank you for the reminder.\nThat would definitely cover part of the cases. All the rest would be complicated as I'm using cVim and therefore it would be useful for me to either allow cVim to run the function from TGS (which is IMHO not allowed due to security reasons) or just making this functionality independent from any extension (e.g. by autosuspending/autodiscarding the tab immediately after it has been opened in the background which is what this GitHub issue is basically about)..

It has a number of unload events registered:\n\nNote it doesn't actually pop up a dialog on unload, but whatever it is doing on unload is perhaps sufficient for it to steal focus away.  It's annoying when this happens, because sometimes I'm in the middle of typing something on a page that's buried somewhere in my dozens of open tabs, and I suddenly get switched away from when I was working on and have to find the tab I was working with again.\nI'm actually happy to write a patch to fix this bug, but I'd like some suggestions on the best way to go about it. I'm guessing a lot of pages have unload event handlers, so simply not suspending such pages would probably result in many pages remaining unsuspended.\nDoes anyone know if there's a way from an extension to unbind some event handlers from a page?

It seems a little bizarre that simple wildcards haven't made it into the extension.\nAs a minimum level of support, I would expect the following to pass a whitelist check:\n- .example.com* - Where the * is a subdomain.\n  - www.example.com\n  - foo.example.com\n- example.* - where the * is a TLD.\n  - example.com\n  - example.co.uk\n- example.com/section/* - Where the * is a part of the site that is not \n  - example.com/section/foo\n  - example.com/section/bar\n. As seen by the above, I finally snapped and decided to look at resolving this issue. It's a single line fix, replacing out url.indexOf(word) >= 0 for RegExp(word).test(url) which returns a boolean.\n. @justingoldberg Hover over the question mark icon.. I should note that I stopped using the published extension some time ago. Since I raised this privacy issue 3 years ago**, the developer has made no effort to prevent or stop or allow the disabling of tracking. In fact, he has actually increased the amount done by the extension!\nIn lieu of an actual fix, my solution instead has been to clone the repo, gut the tracking and run it as a local extension. If you don't know how to clone, modify and then run it locally, then the right thing to do would be to pester the dev to do it, or submit a PR.\nAt the very least there should be an opt-in approach where debugging information is stored locally until there's a problem, at which point a sanitised log can be sent to the developer.\n/rant. :+1: This really gets annoying for me. Shouldn't be too hard to keep track of current scroll location when the page is suspended and then reloaded. Once it has reloaded, I'd expect a wait period of, say a few seconds before the scroll position is re-applied (to ensure that any resources such as AJAX content/images have chance to reload).\n. I do not have this issue. I opened web.whatsapp.com, waited and it suspended by itself. I also tried it with the suspend all tabs functionality and it too suspended the web.whatsapp.com site.\nIs it possible that you have whitelisted it by mistake?\n\n. Hi,\nThis is intended functionality. The extension will not suspend active tabs.\nThanks, Dan\n. Cool. If you think that the issue is resolved/addressed, please can you close it?\nOtherwise it requires the developer to close.\nThanks, Dan (not the developer!) :)\n. :+1: This is definitely a good feature to add.\n. At the very least, this issue is blocked by a Chromium feature request - Add extension API and events to determine which tabs are playing audio.\nUntil that lands in Chrome stable, it won't be possible to implement this functionality.\n. This should be resolved by the changes made in #197.\nAssuming the pull request is successful, you could simply do .*\\.pdf which would filter out urls containing .pdf.\n. Given that this seems like very specific use case for you, it might be best to for the extension and make your own changes.\nAlternately, you could commit a pull request with the changes you made.\n. I don't make the extension, just merely contribute. :)\n. It's entirely possible that some urls may be trip up a regular expression test. With that being said, most of the characters which would cause a problem are recognized as reserved or unsafe characters.\nI think a wildcard would offer some degree of flexibility and be easy for novice users to do themselves.\n. Hi Dean,\nI don't have a problem with either way, but feel that the ability to have a wider control over the domains set is a must-have feature as, at the moment, it's far too narrow.\nThere's plenty of prior art out there on how to do this and one method I still use to implement wildcards can be found on SO.\nFeel free to implement wildcards and reject/close this pull request.\nMany thanks, Dan\n. There's no way for the extension to determine whether the browser is idle but this seems to be a bit overkill.\nThe only scenario where this might seem interesting is for feed-based data (eg news, sports etc), but then, there would be better ways of accessing this data than going down the route of having the extension take pictures of the page for you.\n. It looks like this has been fixed in a previous commit but the author is somewhat lackadaisical when it comes to releases.\n. This can get very complicated and messy quickly.\nBecause Chrome will often lump multiple tabs together into a single process, what you will find is that there's no way to identify which individual tab in that process is choking the CPU. So you'd have to suspend all tabs in that process rather than the one which is causing the CPU spike. This is undesirable.\nThe threshold would also need to be checked over a period of time. There's no reason why a momentary high CPU spike is a bad thing if it only lasts a few cycles, so you'd need to constantly poll CPU usage on multiple processes. This is inefficient and is somewhat paradoxical - an extension using high CPU looking for tabs using high CPU.\nFor reference, the relevant API is chrome.processes which is currently only in the dev channel because it's not ready for prime time yet.\n.

The Great Suspender used to gray out the tabs a little bit when suspended. It doesn't do this anymore, so it is hard to tell at a glance which tabs are suspended and not.

I don't really use that myself, but mostly I'd just like some way to eyeball that a tab's suspended. Maybe an icon, similar to how YouTube shows a play icon when you're playing a video.\n. When I resume pages, it doesn't remember where I was on the page. I think it used to. Is it possible to restore this functionality (remember post-DOM-loaded scroll position, I guess?)\n. Are there any keyboard shortcuts for TGS at this point? Would love to keyboard-shortcut-suspend my tabs.\n. @deanoemcke OK, will check it out. I installed it from the repo on one of my Chromes, and it started suspending everything even though I had it set to Never on that computer. It works mostly-OK on the first computer I updated it on. Is that bug fixed in 5.30?\nBtw, can you use tags or releases for GitHub? That would make it easier to check out the actual commit that you're referring to as 5.30. Or let me know the SHA (so that I avoid in-progress stuff). Or is there a release branch?\n. @deanoemcke Still seems to be happening in 5.30 with a setting of Never. The unsuspend keyboard shortcut doesn't work, but the Suspend one does. How can I provide you more information to troubleshoot? It's a long shot, but I wonder if it's related to the input detection? I didn't type anything for a bit and just watched the tabs to see if it'd happen again as I was typing up this problem report...but it hasn't yet. I think it will, but it's been happening practically immediately so far, and now hasn't. Hrm. Maybe it just took a bit for the new extension script to get loaded on each tab. Does Chrome cache those?\n. @deanoemcke Think I figured out more about this. It seems like tabs that I open in the background automatically get suspended and ignore the configuration. If I go to them and let them finish loading completely, it seems like they mostly respect the settings at that point.\n. @deanoemcke Awesome! Hopefully you also fixed how the keyboard shortcut would operate on the wrong tab sometimes.\nI'll update! :)\n. @deanoemcke Wow, at first glance it's looking much better! You didn't change the version number yet, correct? Just making sure I'm definitely on the new code.\n. @deanoemcke I don't know the conditions for triggering it, but it happens\nrather often on one of my computers. I'll see if it happens again now that\nI have restarted a couple times (maybe there was some old stuff in some\ncache somewhere...)\nThere probably is a pattern, but I can't recognize it. It picks a tab from\nan entirely different window. Not the same URL, not the last tab, and not\nthe last viewed tab. Even if I then click back to the tab in question,\nit'll still sometimes jump back and suspend the wrong one again. However,\nusing the extension button to suspend manually doesn't have this problem.\n\nOn Sun, Nov 2, 2014 at 8:08 AM, deanoemcke notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@Pasroe https://github.com/Pasroe yes. same version number - new code.\nsorry! i'm not aware of the issue where the keyboard shortcut operates on\nthe wrong tab? could you give me some more detail? is it the shortcut for\nsuspending the currently focussed tab? does the tab that actually get\nsuspended have any relationship to the one that you wanted to suspend (ie.\nsame url, next in the window, last viewed tab)?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/102#issuecomment-61396667\n.\n. @deanoemcke This might have to do with when I use the keyboard shortcut to suspend whitelisted sites. I whitelist sites that I want to suspend when I'm on battery but not when I'm at my desk (so that stuff I use fairly often like Gmail or JIRA won't suspend on me, but I can suspend them when I want). Should I use the Pause suspending feature instead? That one is newer, and I'm not sure what it does, so I have been avoiding it.\n. @deanoemcke Now that the beta (new version?) is further along, do you have any thoughts on this? Often I use the extension most when I am out and about in order to save power-hungry Chrome tabs from being quite so power-hungry. At such times, I want the extension to be somewhat aggressive. But when I am plugged in, I'd probably like the time-to-suspension to be higher, and often I feel like I'd even like a separate (narrower) whitelist. e.g. if plugged in, I don't suspend GitHub or JIRA but if I'm on battery I do. Something like that.\n. @lardissone did you wind up doing the fork in the end?\n. I'm on Chrome 38.0.2125.104 and seeing the extension crash whenever I try to suspend anything.\n. Ah! Turning off tidy URLs did indeed work. Maybe dev just moved to stable or something...\n. I'm also using 6.14, and I see the same behavior.

Almost all pages are readable, tho more often than not don't have images. But perfect capture is a bit out of scope of this plugin. If, of course, author wishes to expand it (as he does, pretty much) to be something bigger.\nAnyway, I don't think (i'm sure, actually) the method you proposing is suitable for capturing tabs in background and also is really slow, so the best strategy here will be to monitor rendering engines and hook up the best.

I think feature with text, links etc is a bit overkill. The game is not worth the candle as a least. \nOne could state, having tab no closed, means you wanna refer to it later. In this case having visual representation is a great thing, as you can quickly remember, what's on page and close it, read it or sort. The necessity of searching its text or clicking links? Click on page, load page. If you can't load page, when you are offline, having clickable links won't help you much. Having text? Pretty much unlikely, since searching text on a page as action is pretty much always comes with surfing..\nIf you know you gonna need a page, press ctrl+p, save as pdf..\nAs for feature itself. after using it for some time, I think it's a huge win! My workflow had improved drastically! Being able to quickly parse page (not only top part with article title) is great. Now I can more easily organize 150-250 tabs in several windows and i see not the lists of page titles, but pictures!\n. yeah, that one is needed!\nalso would be great to save and load TGS db on demand (and auto-backup once a day on the drive or to dropbox/gdrive)\non rare occasions TGS crashes and everything is lost, which is a big deal for me (that was happening on updates also)\nbut, actually, since i have Session Buddy now, just having a feature, suggested by topicstarter will be sufficient.\ni'll try to implement it in my spare time and do a pull request. i never learned javascript know javascript, but i think that task will be feasible for me\n.

    "fwextensions": "Here's a thoroughly kludgy idea: on suspended.html, inject a hidden iframe pointing at a page on greatsuspender.github.io, which the extension has access to.  Then inject a content script on that page with a dump of the currently suspended page data, which the script then writes to the local storage of the greatsuspender.github.io page.\nWhen the extension is uninstalled, redirect to that page.  It can then read its data from local storage and offer to reopen all the suspended, and now closed, pages.  I'm betting Chrome would prevent a webpage from opening dozens of new tabs, so the user might have to manually click each one to reopen it.  But better than losing it altogether.  \nThis SO page suggests it might be possible: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15288648/chrome-extension-write-to-local-storage-of-a-different-domain\nBut I go back to my suggestion in #688 of redirecting suspended pages to a web-served page instead of a local one, so that it's not closed on uninstall.  Obviously doesn't help with the next update, but would with all future ones.  May well be some impediment I haven't thought of, though. . @deanoemcke it's possible for an extension to detect a double-click on the browser icon by checking the time between when the port between the popup and the background was opened vs. closed.  My QuicKey extension uses a double-click to toggle between the two most recent tabs.  (It's mostly triggered by double-pressing the alt-Q keyboard shortcut that opens the popup, but a double-click works the same.)\nIn the background script, in chrome.runtime.onConnect it adds a listener for port.onDisconnect: https://github.com/fwextensions/QuicKey/blob/master/src/js/background/background.js#L250\nThen the first thing it does in the popup is call chrome.runtime.connect();:\nhttps://github.com/fwextensions/QuicKey/blob/master/src/js/popup/init.js#L10\nIt tracks the time between the port connect and disconnect, and if it's < 450ms, it toggles to the previous tab.  In the TGS case, it would toggle the suspend state.  \nIt's not 100% reliable, especially on an old machine with Chrome running slowly, but it works well enough.  Listening to the port close is the only way to detect the popup getting closed, since the beforeunload event usually doesn't fire, but the port disconnect does.\n. I see this happen a lot as well, though I'm not sure if there is a workaround.. @liv-in-sky, there was a fix for that committed a few weeks ago as part of #719, but I don't think that version has been released yet.  You could try loading the most recent version from master.  . @liv-in-sky, this is without restarting the canary build?  Do you have the Automatic tab discarding flag set differently between the two versions of Chrome?  Also, which OS are you on?. I thought the default setting would've been enabled, so it's strange that explicitly setting it to enabled made any difference.  But glad it helped. . Strange.  I used to see that issue on Win7 with the old version of the extension, but I haven't seen it on v110 on Win10.  Have you pulled the latest version from master recently?  And this is working fine on Chrome 69, but not on canary? \nFrom @deanoemcke's comment above, it sounds like he thought this was fixed, so maybe he can do some more debugging with you.. @mkz7 I built a tab-switching Chrome extension called QuicKey that has special handling for tabs suspended by The Great Suspender.  It doesn't have the session management features of Tabli, but it does make it easy to type a few characters to find a tab by its title or URL, or to navigate between recently used tabs.  It renders suspended tabs differently its menu, lets you switch to one and unsuspend it with a keyboard shortcut, and it displays the correct title and favicon even if the tab just shows \"Suspended Tab\".. @mkz7 which version of the extension do you have installed?  If you right-click the TGS icon and select Options, and then go to About, the version number is at the top. . @hugegit loading the unpacked alpha version shouldn't affect the webstore version.  I've currently got both running (with only one set to auto-suspend tabs, to reduce confusion).  If you uninstalled the webstore version and then installed the alpha, I'm not sure if recovery is possible.  Maybe there's a backup of the indexeddb file that @adcurtin mentions above?  . If you leave the current version installed, and then install a beta version from GitHub, you can use these steps to switch the tabs from the current extension to the beta one without unsuspending them all (which in my case would make my laptop very sad): https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/689#issuecomment-413263494\nJust don't uninstall the webstore version before switching the tabs.  Otherwise you'll lose all of them.. @Boscop if you're still on the old version from the Chrome webstore, it will eventually get automatically updated when it's enabled for a larger percentage of users. . @togakangaroo I've got an early version of a tab-switcher extension called QuicKey that lets you type just part of a tab title or URL and then switch to that tab. (It doesn't match on text in the page, which would require a lot of local storage and indexing.)  \nIt also supports The Great Suspender: suspended tabs have greyed out favicons and you can hit shift-enter to switch to a suspended tab and immediately unsuspend it.  The URL shown in the results list is also the unsuspended URL, not the long chrome-extension://klb... one in the location bar. \nAnyway, I'm still working on it (it's not even searchable in the store yet), but it sounded like you might find find it useful.  More info here and code here.. Yes, the Gdocs issue is still there with v6.30.  I don't see any errors in the console when inspecting the extension.  \nIf I click the button while a large doc is loading, the menu looks normal:\n\nThen at some point during the load, the menu switches to the one shown above.  Closing and reopening the tab produces the same result. . Ah, this seems to be happening only with documents that are hosted on our company's Gsuite instance, which is almost all I use Gdocs for.  In a personal account, I can suspend a document.  This used to work with internal docs as well, however.  \nCould something about the security settings have changed to block extensions?  How does the extension know it can't interact with a page like chrome.google.com?  I'm wondering if as the page loads, something about the code tells Chrome to lock out extensions.. It's the same https://docs.google.com/document/d/<hash>/edit format for both internal and public docs.   \nThere are a few font-related errors in the Gdoc console, like: GET filesystem:https://docs.google.com/persistent/docs/fonts/2Dm66NBhgsbJgMaLaomyEQ.woff2 net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND.  But nothing else.  \nI tried the handy Copytables extension in a personal Gdoc in an incognito tab and in an enterprise doc.  It was able to find the table in the personal doc but not the enterprise one.  It also didn't respond to alt-dragging to select like it did in the personal account.  That implies to me it could not install its content scripts in the enterprise doc page.\nI haven't found anything that directly covers controlling access to Gdocs for generic Chrome extensions, but there is this page about controlling access for third-party apps that use the Drive API in enterprise installations: https://support.google.com/a/answer/6105699?hl=en. Definitely looks like the extension isn't getting loaded for the internal docs.  This is the console filter in a normal, public Gdoc: \n\nAnd this is the one in the enterprise doc:\n\nLooks like maybe Chrome is redirecting the extension pages to about:blank?. Does the extension need to have access to the page code itself?  I just modified an extension of mine that only has tab and history permissions to redirect a selected tab to chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=${encodeURIComponent(tab.title)}&uri=${tab.url} (I can't seem to get back-ticks to appear in the comment, but assume they're there).  That produced the normal suspended page for an internal Gdoc (though it didn't include the title for some reason):\n\nClicking that page would unsuspend the page just like it would for a normal page.  So it seems like the \"edit any page you visit\" permission is what is blocking The Great Suspender from loading on locked-down Gdoc pages, but just having the tabs permission (and maybe history) is enough to redirect a tab to the suspended state.. Yup, it was an enterprise doc and I called update() just like you show.  I modified my QuicKey extension to suspend the selected tab on shift-enter, instead of unsuspending suspended tabs like it normally does.  It was able to suspend a chrome.google.com page as well, though again without the right title and favicon:\n\nI think what's happening is that the injected content script isn't getting injected, or gets removed at some point during the Gdoc load.  So when the background page calls requestTabInfoFromContentScript(), it doesn't get anything back, so the tab's status is \"unknown\", which causes the suspend menu item to be hidden.\nI haven't dug into what the content script does, but I assume it's tracking activity and creating timers to trigger suspension after inactivity.  I think a workaround for when the script isn't injected would be to simply leave the suspend menu item available, so that the tab can be manually suspended even if it won't auto-suspend.  That would be a huge help in my case.  \nThere may still be ways for the background page to auto-suspend tabs by tracking when they're unfocused and starting timers for them.  It may not be as fine-grained as what the content script does, and you wouldn't be able to prevent it when text fields are being edited, but it might be something.. Thanks!  It'll be great to have that functionality back.\nBTW, if I loaded the unpacked extension locally, would it read/write from the same local storage and handle the existing suspended tabs?  I'd be happy to help debug things, but wouldn't want to lose all ~150 suspended tabs.. Uninstall?  Do you mean unsuspend the tabs?   I think I'd probably just run both and deal with the confusion.  Maybe turn off auto-suspend in the unpacked copy to reduce the overlap between then.. Just wanted to confirm that suspending works again with Enterprise Gsuite docs. . * Win7 64bit Pro\n Chrome Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)\n TGS v6.30\n 320 tabs\n ~35 suspended\n* TGS using 86MB\nSo this isn't unexpected memory usage.  What's strange is that the majority of the tabs are suspended, but most of them are in that state where they just show the TGS icon.  So I guess they're suspended, but the extension isn't tracking them.\nIt would be handy to have the number of suspended tabs listed somewhere, like in the tooltip on the icon, or maybe in Settings > Sessions.\n. I suspect it happened during a browser crash and subsequent restart, but I'm not sure.  I haven't noticed it happen with more recent tabs when they time out and get suspended.  \nIf I click a tab with the TGS favicon, its favicon reloads and updates, usually with the correct suspended favicon, but sometimes with a generic file icon (I'm guessing what comes back from a chrome://favicon/ URL?).\nPerhaps these tabs didn't get saved to TGS's database and then got loaded in the discarded state when Chrome relaunched, so it wasn't notified about them.  When I click the tab, the suspended.html page gets loaded, and TGS has a chance to update the favicon and add the page to its database.  A workaround might be to query all the tabs on runtime.onStartup, check for the TGS extension URL, and add any untracked pages to the database.. I've been restarting Chrome a lot recently, doing some testing on an extension, and these two recently opened tabs got into the forgotten state:\n\n(Hmm, well, the first screenshot didn't work, apparently, and then I used the rightmost tab to load this page.  But it initially had the blockhead icon, too.)\nSo it's not just crashes or very old tabs that it's happening to.  Also, giving these tabs focus didn't cause the favicons to update, and clicking in the body didn't unsuspend the page.  I had to reload it to get the TGS behavior to kick in.  \nI think there are two issues: sometimes the favicon doesn't update, but the title is correct, and just focusing the tab updates the favicon.  The other state is where neither the favicon nor the title is correct, and clicking and focusing does nothing.  . Ah, the second case seems to be because the background page isn't available when the tab loads.  I see this error in the console: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'gsUtils' of null at suspended.js:4\nMaybe using chrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage() with a callback to get the background page would fix that.  Or maybe it would never get called back at all? \nIn terms of reproing, I'm on a fairly old Core i7 with only 8GB of RAM, which Chrome consumes a big chunk of.  So maybe it's an issue of too many tabs and not enough processor time to go around when Chrome starts up.  I also have a few unpacked extensions loaded, so I always get that confirmation dialog when starting up, and other extensions don't seem to load until I cancel it.  Perhaps that interferes with TGS getting time to handle suspended browsers, or is why the background page isn't available when the tab loads. . I see you already have a fix for the unavailable background page in #597.  \nI take back the thing about the unpacked confirmation dialog.  I just restarted Chrome and left the dialog up for 5 minutes.  Even though the toolbar icons for other extensions weren't shown, I believe they got a chance to run.  Even the background page for my unpacked extension that Chrome was warning about got to run right at startup (which seems like it defeats the purpose of the warning).  And I don't see any \"Suspended Tab\" titles anywhere.  \nSo I still don't know how to reliably repro it.  Maybe the fix for the background page will just magically fix this, too.  . I'm on the webstore version.  If I load the alpha version and change the webstore version to never suspend tabs, will the currently suspended tabs just stay in that state?  I'd like to avoid reloading all those tabs. . I was working on my extension, which listens for tabs.onUpdated, and I noticed this sequence of update events (the updated key is listed before the new value):\ntab updated 1178 url chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=A%20better%20similarity%20ranking%20algorithm%20for%20variable%20length%20strings%20-%20Stack%20Overflow&uri=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/653157/a-better-similarity-ranking-algorithm-for-variable-length-strings\ntab updated 1178 title Suspended Tab\ntab updated 1178 title chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=A%20better%20similarity%20ranking%20algorithm%20for%20variable%20length%20strings%20-%20Stack%20Overflow&uri=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/653157/a-better-similarity-ranking-algorithm-for-variable-length-strings\ntab updated 1178 title A better similarity ranking algorithm for variable length strings - Stack Overflow\n\nThis was happening long after startup, and I'm fairly sure I hadn't switched to that tab in a long time.  So it seems like TGS might be sometimes getting a chance to update the tabs in the \"Suspended Tab\" state, though it's odd that the URL is getting updated and that the title briefly changes to the URL, then to the right title.   Not sure if that's relevant, but FWIW.. I've installed the alpha version and disabled suspending in the webstore version.  I'll let you know if I see any issues.\nGlad to see the font on the settings page was updated.  The Open Sans Light font looked a little spindly on Windows.  BTW, you could probably use font-family: system-ui, sans-serif; to use the same OS default font that Chrome uses.  Haven't tested Linux, but on Mac and Windows it seems to map to the right font.. Looks like that page has been updated to mention system-ui, which was added in Chrome 56: https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5640395337760768\nTo support older versions, maybe the best approach is to put system-ui at the beginning of the font stack, so there's a fallback. . I said in the initial comment that the favIconUrl was sometimes empty.  That's true, but I'm also noticing that that key is sometimes set to \"chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/img/icon16.png\", which is odd.  \nSo far, I haven't seen the alpha version do that.. @nathanjd , the alpha version seems to fix this particular issue.  I haven't seen the background page errors while running it. . On a tab suspended by the alpha, after a restart of Chrome (which updated from 62 to 63 in the process), I did see the state where the tab had the correct title but the blockhead icon.  Focusing the tab updated the icon.. Long after that restart, I noticed another tab suspended by the alpha version that had the blockhead icon:\n\nBoth of those tabs should have the same icon.  When I clicked the blockhead tab, which did have the correct title, the icon updated and the normal suspend page loaded.  \nI think the majority of cases I've seen where the suspended tabs lost their icons were due to the unavailable background page bug, which the alpha has fixed.  The other case, where focusing the tab updates everything, seems much rarer. . Yeah, it seems like a combination of limited RAM and CPU resources on startup with hundreds of open tabs.  Perhaps it could be worked around by waiting for the windows.onCreated event after runtime.onStartup fires (to give the browser time to startup), then processing the suspended tabs in a queue.  But maybe not worth working around this, especially if it's rare in more modern machines.\nFWIW, this is what I've been using for a font-family in my extension:\nfont-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto,\n    Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \"Helvetica Neue\", sans-serif;\n\nHaven't tested it exhaustively, but it should fallback to the recommended font stack in older versions of Chrome. . Another case where I saw the icons switch to the blockhead was when I accidentally closed a window with 23 tabs and then reopened it.  About 15 of those tabs had been suspended, most with the production version of TGS, one or two with the alpha 7.0 version.  \nI'm 90% sure most of those tabs had correct icons before the window was closed.  When it was reopened, all the suspended tabs showed the blockhead icon, even those suspended with the alpha 7.0 version.  None showed the \"Suspended Tab\" title that indicates the content script didn't run.  Focusing the tab updated the icon to the correct greyed out version. \nSo at least for me, the icons aren't lost just on startup.  Reopening a bunch at once can also cause the issue.  I'll have to update to the latest alpha to see if that might fix it.  . It's Win7 Pro.  Chrome is build 64.0.3282.119, but I haven't noticed any changes in TGS over recent updates.\nFor me, the icon issue is reproducible with closing and reopening a window.  I clicked every suspended tab in this window to make sure the greyed out icon loaded, closed the window, then reopened it.  Every suspended tab reverted to the blockhead.\n\nThe tab second from the right was suspended with the 7.0.72 alpha, but its icon wasn't restored either.  I didn't see any errors in the background page of 6.30. . Thanks for trying to repro it.  I just tried it again and the same thing happened. \nI noticed in the video that the unpacked extensions dialog was still open in Chrome, though that probably shouldn't matter.  I currently have 329 tabs open, probably about 2/3 suspended, so that may be the biggest difference.  I'm also running a bunch of other extensions, so possibly one of those is interfering, though I'm not sure how they could.  These include extensions like uBlock Origin, Pocket, Copytables, Stylish, and PushBullet.\nIn the video, the suspended tabs seem to update their icons one after the other in the background. \n When I click a tab with the blockehead icon, it renders completely blank at first, then the suspended view loads and the icon updates, but the other tabs don't.  It seems like Chrome just isn't giving any of these tabs time to do any processing at all.  \nIf you're not able to reproduce it and you're not getting other complaints about it, it may not be a big deal.. @liamjohnston @deanoemcke Related to the font stack question, I just came across this post from the GitHub team about their font stack evolution: http://markdotto.com/2018/02/07/github-system-fonts\nIn particular, they seem to have reverted their use of system-ui:\n\nThankfully our users are always quick to notice problems and were quick to point out to our Support teams that the new system-ui alias caused issues in WebKit and Blink browsers with non-English languages. We reverted the change back to the previous version and haven\u2019t touched it since.. In the latest version of Chrome, I saw a couple cases where the webstore extension seems to have faded the blockhead multiple times, like the first two underlined icons in the screenshot:\n\n\nOne thing I recently noticed was that the auto-discard functionality in Chrome had been disabled awhile ago, which might have caused some different behaviors for TGS.  \n. I've been using the 7.0.72 alpha to auto-suspend tabs for the past couple weeks, with the webstore version enabled, but with suspend set to never, and I still sometimes see suspended tabs with the TGS icon instead of a favicon after a Chrome restart on Win7:\n\nAll of them have the correct title, so they don't seem to be cases of the background page not being available.  Clicking one of these tabs updates the favicon as expected. . Yeah, I guess I only noticed because I was comparing the menus between the webstore and alpha versions.  Closing this since it's intentional.  . Here's another example where I had manually suspended the tab, and the icon was greyed out.  But then I restarted Chrome, and at some point (I'm not sure when, possibly at startup), the tab started showing the un-greyed out favicon:\n\nIf I query that tab via chrome.tabs.get(), the favIconUrl is set to \"chrome://favicon/https://<page url>\" .. I just restarted Chrome and that site above that I had suspended is now unsuspended.  Its domain is on the whitelist, but I had manually suspended it.  Do suspended pages on whitelisted domains automatically get unsuspended on a restart now?  \nAlso, that suspended QuicKey page's favicon is now back to being the fully opaque version after the restart. . What I said in the first comment about pages where the content script didn't load not getting greyed out icons is no longer happening for me.  It was very consistent in one session, but after restarting recently, manually suspending one of those pages showed the correct suspended icon.  Not sure what's going on.\nI'll open another issue on the suspended tabs getting unsuspended on restart.  That just happened for a bunch of suspended tabs, though not all. . Is there a v7.0.77 release on GitHub?  The last one I see under Releases is 7.0.alpha.72.  I assume there's a way of pulling that version, but I'm not git-savvy enough to do it. . This might (?) be more common when Chrome was force quit and then restarted.  I've been having issues with Chrome 62 on Win7 where its commit size would increase continuously after waking the laptop, so I've been having to force quit it more often.  I don't think I've seen any tabs suspended by the production extension unsuspend themselves. . I had downloaded the 7.0-alpha.72 zip and was using that.  Looks like debugging is enabled in that build. . The Don't suspend for now option may do what you want, though not through a restart, I think.. This sounds similar to bug #619 that I was seeing, and which seems to be fixed in the alpha versions.. If the unsuspend all was intentional, then the behavior I saw makes sense.  Glad that's been backed out. :). Another advantage that occurred to me: the web-served page could detect that TGS was no longer installed and then offer to redirect itself to the original URL.  Or when its tab is focused, it could just redirect automatically if it can't communicate with the TGS background page, on the assumption the extension has been uninstalled.  . It seemed unlikely that you hadn't considered this approach, but the upside appeared worth double-checking.\nTotally agree with the desire to keep restarts fast.  But my understanding is that for awhile now, Chrome has been reloading only the visible tabs on a restart, leaving the others in the discarded state, so they only load when you activate them.  If that's true, restarting with suspended tabs pointing at a remote host might not be any slower.  \nNo idea about resource usage in a cached remote page vs. a local extension page, but I'd assume the process (and therefore, the memory footprint) used to host and render both would be the same. \nNo doubt the refactoring is an obstacle.  But based on a comment somewhere here, it sounded like there was already a solution to the upgrade cycle that would take two cycles to kick in?  (In other words, after the next+1 release, subsequent releases wouldn't cause the tabs to be lost?  In that case, remote hosting wouldn't be necessary.). To be clear, that was based on this comment:\n\nwell the good news is that there was an obvious way to solve this the whole time, but it is going to take 2 new releases before it takes effect (ie. it only kicks in once you have the next new version already installed, and are about to receive the subsequent new version).. Definitely agree it doesn't belong in the GA extension, but I could imagine it showing up as an option in the Session Management section of Settings if the extension detects its ID isn't the webstore one (or it could check the installType).  Though it might not be worth the complication.  A link to a gist or something in the README could suffice to let people know it's possible and how to do it.  . @alidan I assume you've installed a local copy of TGS from GitHub?  The following steps should automate what you suggested, changing the URL of the webstore version of TGS to a locally installed one.\n\n\n\nGo to chrome://extensions.\n\n\nMake sure Developer mode is enabled in the top-right of the page. \n\n\nFind the local version of The Great Suspender you installed.  The ID will not start with klb (which is the webstore version).\n\n\nIf it says Background page next to  Inspect views, then click that link.  A devtools window should open.\n\n\nClick the Console tab in the devtools window.\n\n\nCopy and paste the following code into the console:\n```javascript\nfunction switchTabs(count) {\n    chrome.management.getSelf(self => {\n        const fromID = \"klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg\";\n        const fromURLPattern = \"chrome-extension://\" + fromID + \"/suspended.html*\";\n        const toID = self.id;\n    chrome.tabs.query({ url: fromURLPattern }, tabs => {\n        tabs = tabs.slice(0, count || tabs.length);\n        tabs.reduce((seq, tab) =>\n            seq.then(() =>\n                new Promise(resolve =>\n                    chrome.tabs.discard(tab.id, discardedTab =>\n                        chrome.tabs.update(chrome.runtime.lastError ? tab.id : discardedTab.id,\n                            { url : tab.url.replace(fromID, toID) },\n                            () => {\n                                console.log(\"switched:\", tab.title);\n                                resolve();\n                            }\n                        )\n                    )\n                )\n            ), Promise.resolve()\n        )\n    });\n});\n\n}\n```\n\n\nType switchTabs(1) in the console and press enter.\n\n\nThe title of a suspended tab should print to the console.  Verify it's been switched to your local version of TGS.  It should have a URL like chrome-extension://<your local copy's ID>/suspended.html#....\n\n\nIf that looks good, type switchTabs() and press enter.  Not passing any parameter will switch all the tabs.  Or you could do switchTabs(20) or whatever if you're more comfortable switching them in batches.  But it should be fine to do them all at once.\n\n\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. That's probably because of the uri= in the URL.  Calling gsUtils.getHashVariable(\"uri\", \"blah#uri=http://dbpedia.org/sparql?default-graph-uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdbpedia.org&query=PREFIX+foaf%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fxmlns.com%2Ffoaf%2F0.1%2F%3E%0D%0A%0D%0ASELECT+%3Fperson+%3Fname+where+%7B%0D%0A+++%3Fperson+foaf%3Aname+%3Fname+.%0D%0A%7D+LIMIT+100&format=text%2Fhtml&CXML_redir_for_subjs=121&CXML_redir_for_hrefs=&timeout=30000&debug=on&run=+Run+Query+\") returns \"http://dbpedia.org/sparql?default-graph-\".  It doesn't look like the code handles a URL with a uri= substring already in it. . Interestingly, my QuicKey extension unsuspends that page to the correct URL.  It assumes everything from the uri= to the end of the string is the unsuspended URL, which might be a bad assumption if TGS ever changes the hash format. . Right.  Looks like changing that line to this would fix it:\nvaluesByKey.uri = hashStr.split('uri=').slice(1).join(\"\");\n\nThat joins the split pieces back together, in case the uri gets split into multiple pieces.  I changed it in an alpha build and it does seem to work.\nBut just slicing at the index of \"uri=\" might be a little more straightforward.  Or matching with a regex, since one's used to pull out the # anyway, something like this:\nvar match = urlStr.match(/^[^#]+#(.*?)&?uri=(.+)$/);\n\nif (!match) {\n    return false;\n}\n\nhashStr = match[1];\nvaluesByKey.uri = match[2];\n\nAnd using a new URLSearchParams() to parse the key/values would probably be a little safer than just splitting on &.\nAnyway, it looks like assuming uri is the very last parameter is a safe assumption since it has to be, given that it's not URI-encoded.  Otherwise, any params in the URI would get mixed in with TGS's. \n. That chrome-extension://... URL is the page that replaces a tab when it's suspended by The Great Suspender.  I would've thought that tab would be closed when the extension is uninstalled, though.  \nIf you want to get back to the original page, copy everything after the uri= and paste that into the location bar. . Depending on how many tabs you have open, I suspect TGS wouldn't have time to suspend them all before Chrome closes and kills the process.  Perhaps a shift-click on Suspend other tabs could be added that would suspend all (seems like too rare a use case to warrant its own menu item).  At least that would save two clicks.\nOr you can Suspend other tabs and then use the keyboard shortcut to suspend the current one.  So two clicks and a keypress. . Is this maybe only happening on Linux?  Never seen it on Windows. . Interesting.  I don't think I've ever seen a suspended tab request focus in a few years of running TGS on Windows.  Could it be interacting with some other extension you're running in both Windows and Linux? . Did this just start happening with Chrome 69?  I'm still on 67 in Win7, which might be the difference. . That's weird, because it sounds like one of the changes in Chrome 69 is to prevent unfocused tabs from stealing focus:\n\nThe window.confirm() method no longer activates its parent tab\nIf a document in a background tab calls window.confirm(), it returns immediately with false, and no dialog is shown to the user. If the tab is active, then the call shows a dialog as normal. Specifically, this removes the ability to use window.confirm() to bring a tab to the front because this is rarely what the user wants.\n\nPerhaps something about how TGS suspends tab is causing a buggy interaction with this new logic in 69. . For people on Chrome 69 or 70, do you have the screen capture option on or off?  Maybe the rendering of the page to a canvas as the tab is suspended is causing an issue.  Perhaps the addition of OffscreenCanvas to 69 had some interaction.\nAccording to this page, 69 will be marked stable in 3 weeks: https://www.chromestatus.com/features/schedule  So there's a countdown to Tabbageddon started.. Maybe the latest alpha fixes it?  https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.0-beta.94. Never seen it on Win7 or Win10 x64 up through Chrome 67, using either the webstore version or an older alpha.  Sounds like it started happening in 69, and the focus grabbing is more aggressive in Win7 and Linux, while Win10 is more polite, but still annoying. . FWIW, I installed Chrome 70 on a Win10 machine (without admin privileges, if that matters), added the webstore version of TGS, set it to suspend after a minute, opened several tabs in a couple of windows, and I'm not seeing any focus issues when the tabs suspend.  \nCould be some other extension's content script reacting to the tab getting suspended?  Or maybe a Chrome flag that was set at some point in the past? . Could this be related to https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/646, which @CollinChaffin was seeing but @deanoemcke wasn't able to reproduce?  Perhaps it's due to some experimental flag that some users set at some point, or was set by an earlier dev build, and is now stuck in a state that's different from what you'd get in a fresh install of the dev channel. \nIf you open chrome://flags and then open devtools, running this code should dump out all the flags set to non-default values:\nreturnExperimentalFeatures = (data) => { \n    let changed = data.supportedFeatures.filter(feature => !feature.is_default); \n    changed.forEach(feature => { \n        let option = feature.options.filter(opt => opt.selected)[0]; \n        console.log(feature.name, option.description); \n    });  \n};\nrequestExperimentalFeaturesData()\n\nMight be a clue there. . I guess the flag data has changed in 70?  I don't have access to a system with 70 right now.  This code should at least handle flags that don't have an options array so that it won't throw:\nreturnExperimentalFeatures = (data) => { \n    let changed = data.supportedFeatures.filter(feature => !feature.is_default); \n    changed.forEach(feature => {\n        let options = feature.options; \n        let option = options && options.filter(opt => opt.selected)[0] || { description: \"unknown value\" }; \n        console.log(feature.name, option.description); \n    });  \n};\nrequestExperimentalFeaturesData()\n\nAgree that it's probably unlikely that this bug is due to weird flags, unless those get synched across installs based on the signed-in Chrome user.. I think I may have seen this behavior in 68 when loading the extension from the master branch.  It started suspending discarded tabs, and it seemed like sometimes that made the tab come forward.  It was a little hard to tell, as my machine became nearly unresponsive, as described here https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/723#issuecomment-415629153, so it may have been very delayed responses to clicks.  But I definitely hadn't seen anything like that in extension versions up through 7.0.72.  . I've been running the alpha TGS with tab discarding enabled in Chrome 67 on a Win7 machine with only 8GB and a few hundred tabs open (many suspended) and haven't noticed any low virtual memory warnings.  I've left the discarding enabled for testing, even though it seems to be quite stupid in what it chooses to discard.  I'll often open a new tab with a lot of content (like a long Google Doc) and then go back to the previous one, only to find it reloading because it was discarded, despite having been using it seconds ago.  . Still happens for me on my old Win7 laptop with 8GB RAM and a few hundred tabs open across ~20 windows.  Much less common on a newer machine. Perhaps it's the large number of windows part that is making it more common for me. \n\nAt least the tab title is correct with the 7.x branch, which wasn't always true with 6.30.  . Yes, they stay that way throughout the session, and most after a restart as well.  However, as soon as they're focused, the favicon does update.  \nThe tabs in the screenshot were suspended with 7.0.72.  I've been meaning to try the latest build on my personal laptop with 16GB RAM.  I think it's a combination of lots of tabs, lots of windows, and lots of memory pressure. \nAll the tabs with the default icon seem to be in the discarded state, so that explains why they update when focused.  This is different than 6.30, when the background page sometimes wouldn't be available and the title was just \"Suspended Tab\".  \nActually, I wonder if tab discarding explains the suspended tabs with default icons.  In other words, lots of tabs are suspended and then get discarded because of low memory.  On relaunch, Chrome leaves the suspended.html tabs discarded, and assumes the TGS icon is the right one, since it is a TGS page.  Then, because there are a lot of tabs and a lot of open windows with active tabs showing heavy pages (GDocs, etc.) and not enough memory, Chrome doesn't bother undiscarding those suspended pages.  So the page is never loaded, the extension is never notified, and it never gets a chance to update the icon.\nI supposed a workaround would be for TGS to check for discarded tabs sometime after launch, check each if it's suspended.html and its favicon is the TGS icon, then update the icon to the correct one.. Open the first 200 links on nytimes.com into tabs across 10 windows in a 4GB Win7 VM, and that'll probably do the trick.  :). Just happened with version 109 installed from GitHub:\n\nI'd set 109 to never suspend, but I guess the \"suspend instantly when memory is low\" option was set by default, and at some point I noticed it going through discarded tabs and suspending them.  So I turned off that feature.\nAbout an hour ago, I had to restart the OS and Chrome.  I don't think I noticed the blockheads at first, because they didn't appear in the couple of windows I was using most.  But just now, I noticed lots of tabs with correct titles but the faded out blockhead icon.  \nI have 361 tabs open, 277 of which are discarded, and 211 of those are pages suspended by v109.  Win7, Chrome 68.\nI pasted the log from v109 here, with URLs removed (it would probably be good to not print URLs to the console to make it easier for testers to share logs): https://gist.github.com/fwextensions/cf35acf781058a3fe24e52b3a20af2b9\nI launched Chrome at 2:55pm, so it looks like it's missing the first 10 minutes after startup.  One thing to notice is that it's setting a tabFlag on tab 1063 ~45 times in a row, and then getting 45 responses.  This happens with some other tabs, like 921 (which happens to be this tab, strangely).  \n1063 is a tab that has an Enterprise Gdoc open, which I think we determined was blocking content scripts from being injected.  So maybe that's causing the looping?  (Though it's strange that it's getting a response if there was no script to respond, or perhaps it's in a weird state.)\n. Rather than setting the URL of the discarded tab, which will cause a Chrome process to fire up and load suspended.html, is it possible to just set the tab's favicon URL directly?  Hmm.  After poking around, I see that it's suspended.js that sets the favicon, and chrome.tabs.update() doesn't seem to let you set it, so maybe there's no way to change it from outside the page.  Just seeing if there was a way to avoid loading the discarded page.\nI noticed in the code that generates the transparent favicon, it will default to the blockhead if the URL is empty or the image is totally transparent.  Is that what's causing the default icon to show?  I wonder if the favicon sometimes just isn't available during startup, and so Chrome is returning an empty one.  But maybe if the suspended page didn't set it to the default favicon, Chrome would later load the correct/cached one? \nRe: logs, I think all those objects were live toggle-able objects in the console, but changed to \"object\" when the logs were copied.  I think you'd have to explicitly serialize them to a string when calling console.log() to make them copyable as a string. . Probably this isn't super helpful, since it's an old build, but I'd been running the 110 build from GitHub for awhile with no issues.  IT just rebooted my Windows 10 laptop and after I logged in, Chrome eventually auto-started (maybe 30 seconds after login) and restored the previous session of about 240 tabs and 7 windows.  All the suspended tabs showed blockhead favicons and didn't update on their own.\n\nAll the titles are fine and focusing the tab does fix up the favicon.  It looks like maybe a few of the favicons updated after the auto-restart, but the vast majority didn't.  I'd previously quit and restarted Chrome, and the favicons had updated in the background.  What was different in this case was the forced restart, then login and auto-start of Chrome while other apps were also restarting.\nChrome Version 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit), Win 10 Enterprise, v1703, 16GB RAM\nGist of the console after the forced restart.  Lots of tab initialization failures, as expected.. I haven't restarted since the above, and now I'm noticing that tabs are getting suspended into a bad state, where it's just showing a blank suspended.html page, with the title just the URL.  The console has \"Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.\" errors, looks like one for each suspended tab.\nHowever, I just realized I'd pulled from upstream master, but didn't reload the extension, which is loaded from the unpacked /src folder.  I'd assumed Chrome had already cached those for the extension, but maybe it's pulling in those new source files, which must be incompatible with what's in memory.  \nI refreshed the extension, and then remembered why I hadn't before: all the suspended tabs closed, which was a little terrifying.  But v155 did recover all the tabs (I think) and all the blockhead icons were updated.  So hopefully it won't happen again with this version. . I haven't noticed any blockhead issues since 155.  The only other issue was the wrong Gdocs icons, which is fixed in 159. . @deanoemcke please turn that feature off by default!  I just tried loading master from GitHub and it hammered by CPU:\n\nI had to kill Chrome to regain control of my machine.  Not as bad as #687 but it still took several minutes of slowly navigating to and launching Process Explorer before I could kill it.  \nI guess it was trying to undiscard and then suspend every discarded tab when the extension was enabled?  I'm not convinced this feature is a good idea at all, but if it's available, I think it should only work prospectively, as tabs get discarded in the future.  Trying to reload hundreds of discarded tabs at once will bring down older machines.  \nThis is Win7 Chrome 68. . It's not clear what's happening in that bug, but what I saw was the CPU spiking as soon as the extension loaded.  Tabs in the background, which I'm pretty sure had been discarded, started showing spinners, as if they were loading.  That would be consistent with them being undiscarded, causing them to start loading, in order for them to then be suspended.\nWhat's strange is that I don't think I lost any tabs after killing Chrome, restarting it, restoring the tabs, and immediately turning off the 104 version of the extension.  I guess it either didn't successfully suspend any tabs or what was restored was the set of URLs immediately before installing 104 from a local folder.  . @deanoemcke Is the change to call queueTabForSuspension() instead of forceTabSuspension()?  I was looking at the pulled diff and didn't see anything else that seemed like it would be relevant to discarded tabs getting switched to the suspended state.\nAnyway, this time I had proc explorer ready to kill Chrome if needed.  I enabled the latest version from GitHub and... it mostly seemed fine.  Some CPU spiking, but the machine was still usable:\n\nThis was with 362 tabs open across 22 windows.   330 of those were discarded, and 56 of the discarded tabs had also been suspended previously by either the Chrome store version or the .72 alpha (both were running). \nHowever, I did notice that all the non-discarded suspended tabs got unsuspended.  This time, I had only 7 of those.  If all of those had been unsuspended at once (and usually I have more like 150 suspended) then I think the performance would've tanked.  I looked at the code but couldn't tell where the startup sequence might be trying to unsuspend all those tabs. \nOh, I guess it's from checkTabsForResponsiveness()?  Seems like pingTabScript() will reload a suspended tab that's not responding, but these tabs weren't suspended by the 109 version of the extension, so it's not surprising they didn't respond.  The if (gsUtils.isSuspendedTab(tab)) { line seems like it should pass true to do an exact match, so that the extension isn't trying to reload tabs it didn't suspend, since reloading a suspended tab will normally cause it to load the unsuspended page, right?  \nIt's certainly an edge case that would only affect people trying non-store versions, but I suspect this may be what happened with my #687 issue.  The latest alpha at that time was probably treating all my suspended tabs as unresponsive and reloading them all at once, locking up the machine.  \nAlso, I don't think it played into what happened to me before, but the processRequestTabSuspensionQueue() function may be a little aggressive.  If I'm reading the code right, it would try to suspend 20 tabs/second until the queue is empty.  With memory pressure and hundreds of tabs, I could see that locking up a machine, especially if most of the tabs it's trying to suspend are already discarded (I don't think it checks for this).  Chrome would be trying to spin up 20 processes/second, reload each one's page, and then immediately switch each to the suspended page, which would take way more memory then just leaving them alone in the discarded state. . One other note: I'd had the 104 version installed, but disabled.  I simply re-enabled it for the test above, which is when the suspended tabs got unsuspended.  I noticed that the Extensions page still said 104, since Chrome doesn't reload the manifest when you re-enable an extension.  I also noticed there was no logging in the background page, which I then saw was disabled in the code.  So I set debugInfo to true and reloaded the extension.  I captured the log from that reload here.\nOne thing I noticed was that it logged Reinjecting contentscript into unresponsive active tab. 56 times but with only 36 unique tab IDs.  Shouldn't it work the first time? \nFor beta testers, you might want to set debugInfo based on the result from chrome.management.getSelf().  If installType == \"development\", then you could enable debugging, and leave it off otherwise. . Thinking about this a little more, it's not clear to me why it would matter if a suspended tab was unresponsive.  If the user does an unsuspend all, and the content script doesn't respond to the command, the background script can just set the tab's URL directly.  If the JS on suspend.html itself has crashed, then if the user wanted to unsuspend, they can just reload the page or click the title, which is a link to the page and should work without JS.  . Sorry for the novel above, and for the confusion on processRequestTabSuspensionQueue().  I didn't get that, on the next call, inProgressTabIds would get built back up and therefore prevent new ones to be queued.  (Though MAX_TABS_IN_PROGRESS is set to 10 at the top of the file, and I didn't see that it was later changed to 5 or 3.)\nI was posting on this issue as I thought what the 104 version was doing was undiscarding and then suspending every discarded tab due to the new \"instantly suspend\" option.  What I now think it was doing was what I saw 109 do, which was unsuspend every suspend.html tab from another installed version of the extension.  I can open another issue for that.  \nI've been pushing on these issues because the only times I've had trouble with TGS is when something has triggered a mass unsuspend and it locks up my machine.  So I've been on the lookout for things that could cause that (like the still scary Unsuspend All menu item :).. A larger favicon can be pulled via chrome://favicon/size/48/https://google.com, though there's no guarantee a site has a larger one available. . >  for me, if i click anywhere on a suspended tab on a window that is NOT in the foreground, it does not action an unsuspend. \nI've never seen that behavior in either Win7 or Win10.  Focusing a background window by clicking the bottom area of a suspended tab has always unsuspended it for me.  TGS would need to be checking the tab focus state when handling the click to prevent the default behavior, which is for the page to get the click event. \nmacOS handles clicks on background windows differently, and doesn't pass on the click to any of the controls in the window (at least by default, I think). . Ah, you can drag select on the title if you start the drag at the very beginning of the text.  If you start it on either side of it, it'll trigger an unsuspend.  I think because the whole top bar was unclickable before, it was easier to select the title.  \nThe URL doesn't seem to drag selectable no matter where I start, but I agree that right-clicking is generally a better approach.  It's just that I saw both lines of text and thought it could be useful to select both to copy both.  Minor thing, though. . One solution might be to restore tabs in a suspended state after an upgrade, so that it wouldn't be loading all the pages at once.  If it's restoring tabs that had been suspended previously, I don't know why it would restore them in anything but a suspended state.. Looking at the code, it seems like tabs that had been suspended and were closed when the extension updated should have been reloaded in the suspended state.  Sounds like that didn't happen in your case, though. . It's most noticeable in s's, as the diagonal middle piece breaks down a bit with the lighter weight Segoe:\n\n\nThe lighter weight is okay on retina screens, but looks too light to me on standard def.  Removing the font-weight style is how I got the second screenshot in the OP, and I think looks good on SD Windows. . No question performance is important, even if it's only a perceived lack thereof.  From limited testing, it looks like inactive tabs with animations don't add much/any overhead, as you'd hope.  A background window with an animation does add some processing overhead while it's running, though. \nThere are a few ways of mitigating that.  The extension's already tracking the active window, so it could show an animated version of the SVG in the active tab only when the window is focused.  The animation could also be changed to repeat only X times, to limit the processing, so a background window with an active suspended tab would only repeat a few times before settling down.  It should also be possible to create a much lighter-weight animation, such as just animating showing/hiding the existing z's in the image, so that a smaller area is being redrawn. . Maybe unchecking the Instantly suspend when system memory gets very low option would change that behavior?  Also, 7.0.109 is the latest version in the webstore, so you might try clicking Update in the Extensions page to force it to update (I think Developer mode has to be on to see the button).. My inclination would be to leave the suspended tabs from other versions alone by default, but have an option for a locally installed version to take over those tabs on demand.  The extension could check if it's installed locally and then show that option if it is, maybe as a button on the Session Management page.  Loading an old session could maybe just automatically load suspended tabs with the URL of whatever version is doing the loading.  \nAt the least, the loose check should be tightened a bit to avoid the edge case of suspended.html appearing in non-TGS URLs.. Yeah, this isn't a size a window usually stays at, but I've noticed it when detaching external monitors, or moving windows between monitors with different UI scaling.  You can end up with weirdly sized windows, and it seemed like it would look cleaner without any overlap.  \nI'd say at least stick a z-index on the top bar so the text isn't obscured.\n\n. Sounds good.  I'll close the PR.  It was mostly an excuse to refresh my memory on how flexbox works.. Closing this, as PR #751 fixes the overlap. . @liamjohnston reopened the PR with just the z-index change. . Maybe track the url across loads, and if it\u2019s the same, don\u2019t reset the timer?. I just manually suspended a Google Doc and it showed the correct favicon.  I believe all the ones with the wrong icons were auto-suspended and recovered after I restarted the extension.  I haven't restarted Chrome since, so maybe it's in a weird state.  I haven't noticed any other incorrect favicons.. I've since restarted my machine and now the logos are incorrectly showing Doc icons instead of Sheets:\n\nSome of those tabs are spreadsheets and presentations but they all look like documents.  \nIs the new favicon handling only looking at domains and using the same favicon if the domains are the same?  They're all docs.google.com, and differ only in the root of the path, so that approach won't work for Google Docs and likely other sites as well. . @deanoemcke I pulled 159 and this looks fixed.

As a student, when I suspend a 300-page textbook PDF on a Chromebook I immediately notice the difference in the entire system. I've been playing around with the code and found that file:// urls work fine with GS if you just add a few lines of code. Now I'm just working on a prompt for the user to enable access to file:// URLs if they have not already. I'll create a PR when I've finished.. Not sure if anyone will see this but I can confirm that the issue is still happening for me, on both Windows and ChromeOS.

    "alidan": "im not able to load them all, i don't even need to try to, if chrome decides to bundle them all together they crash out at around 1.5gb of use, and if it does not bundle them, than its using so many processes that it would cause the whole computer to crash.\na rough estimate if i had the ram to load everything is about 14-20gb, many sites hover around 100mb, but if ram is an issue, will shrink to about 30mb, and about 150 of those tabs always hover about 30mb so i can guarantee at least 4.5gb\nas for version of chrome\n34.0.1847.131 m\ni have an update ready to fire, but as you can imagine, closing and reloading chrome is an ordeal, its about 5 minutes of being unable to touch anything because it loads my processor to 100% and never lets go till the suspender kicks in lets me close out complete windows at a time. \nthis excessive ram usage has been an issue i have had for a while, but 2gb was just unacceptable. i know that if i did close out the extension, and then reload all the tabs and suspend them, the suspender would hover around 200-400mb at most, last time i did that it was at 1.5gb and once i was done it hovered around 150mb. \nand no, screen capturing is not turned on. \n. no, if i don't suspend new tabs to bring old ones out and put them back in, it stays stable. \nthe problem is ill find a youtube video i don't want to watch now, suspend it, and that adds significant amounts to the suspender, sure each tab may not add to much, but over time the little here and there add up. if i don't give tabs the opportunity to fully load, suspended they take up relatively little resources. \n4.74 for the suspender version. on a side note, what does the beta version have over the 4.74? \nas it stands i'm going to be getting it but knowing ahead of time would be nice, going to see what i can do about minimizing tabs before i move over through and that can take time. \nand i use session buddy already, i generally use it as a tab backup measure though, and yea, chrome auto reloads tabs, and if i have a small amount up, yes, it can reload them suspended, but once i push 100 suspended tabs... the extension kind of doesn't care anymore and randomly has them loaded or suspended. \n. ok, makes sense.\n. just for anyone who keep an absolute shit ton of tabs open and is on an older version of the extension, session buddy lets you save the entirety of what you have open, and should be recoverable if you quit the extension to update. i dont get to shut chrome down much as re opening 400~ tabs kind of takes a long, long time to do. \n. Ok, just upgraded from version 4.74 to newest on the google store... \nall i can say is holy shit. \nthis extension got really good, and i'm sad i didn't update sooner. \nnow, to tell you how i updated\nclosed chrome, but saved session in session buddy, prepared to all links i had open (152) and rest computer, restarted, and chrome crashed so restarted it again and it didnt try to open all the tabs this time, backed up version 4.74 and removed it, got newest, and every link worked, nothing lost. \nto the person making this extension, you should shill out session buddy too, its a fantastic companion extension for this. \n. Funny thing is, because firefox is moving to chrome style, its getting rid of all its advantages, taking on chrome's disadvantages along with not fixing the core of firefox. Kinda kills all use firefox had, at least the forks don't have to abandon the extensions though. . sorry bout that, just did an email search and I never received a notification for this till it was closed.\nThe issue was simple, I started to use this extention\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sidewise-tree-style-tabs/biiammgklaefagjclmnlialkmaemifgo?hl=en\nshortly after that, in the chrome task manager I would have 1 tab that was suspended, and 1-20 tabs that were in the same process, and even when I suspended the active tab that everything was under, none of the tabs would give up any of their ram resources.\nI believe it was an incompatibility with that extension that caused it. since then I moved from sidewise to tabs outliner and haven't seen the issue replicate itself. \nsince the first post of this issue, I have moved to a new computer so the ram issue is far more minimal then it was before, having 32gb of ram rather than 16gb, with somewhere around 550 tabs suspended, the extension wants 1gb in its footprint and 900mb active use.\nas for version I was using, whatever is on the chrome web store at the time, and still now.\nEither way, its no longer an issue for me as I moved away from the extension I believe was causing problems. . As far as I am aware, when session buddy crashes, or at least when it crashed for me a few times, it didn't kill tabs, it just stopped working correctly and all I had to do was delete the suspended stuff to get the tab back.\nthere should be a way to deal with tabs in a better way.\nThankfully both of these things happened while I was away so I was not actively doing shit, so a backup from thread outliner allowed me to get back to square one, but its annoying it came to that at all. . 1.3gb\naround 800 tabs\nversion 6.30\nchrome Version 61.0.3163.100 \nwindows 7\nHonestly, it's far better than it was when I made, granted now chrome itself is being the pain in the ass with its bs, the most recent of it being the material design for everything... its to the point that i'm going to see about a firefox switch once the quantum is out of beta. last I used firefox I considered it unusable so wonder if they fixed all my issues with it or if they still haven't. . @deanoemcke this happened to me too a while back. When a stupidly large image was loaded in chrome, my nvidia 1060 6gb shit the bed and couldn't render it. I think this was a chrome issue around... mid april march, as I have not updated the nvidia drivers since installing it. shortly after the rendering failing, I was able to close the tab/regain control of the browser, however suspended tabs would not loose the great suspender icon, among other issues what were not tgs involved. \nThis may be an avenue to look down, websites that chrome doesn't like seems to affect everything in some way. . @quantuumsnot this got buried in my email, at the time, I had a very large session open that basically crashed, after that I went on to opening very small amounts of tabs, 7-11 tabs at a time and found out it was massive images that were killing chrome at the time. \nlarge images are still painful in chrome but they are no longer as bad as they use to be. . Ok got forwarded here due to a few of the issues I posted problems with\nI never found the unsuspend all a viable option as there are a few websites I go to that would throw a fit if I unsuspended everything at once. \nI think this is a viable alternative, however doing anything with scripts goes over my head, anyone want to tell me what to do in a way that an idiot can do it?\njust a side note, I think going forward there needs to be a recover option for TGS\nchrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=Google&uri=https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl\nThat should be google, Tgs should be able to see\nchrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=Google&uri=\nand recognize that its a tgs link\nIf I manually delete that string the page opens as normal so my thought would be in the icon or in the right click menu, a 'recover tab' option that would see the TGS string, remove it, and open it like normal would work, from here, I dont know if TGS needs to have the tab open, but you could get the string, remove the bit from the old one, and replace it with a new one, allowing the tab to remain suspended without forcing it open, as I said, I have websites that would hate being reopened only to be suspended again.. Personally I want the old color back, the problem with the new colors are they are so close to 'chrome is having issues' colors that it takes a while to realise the page itself is just suspended. \nIf I remember right, the top area of the screen could be clicked on without un suspending the tab, I could be wrong as Its something I stopped paying attention to a long time ago and just did it, it was nice to have a section to focus a windows clicking on the chrome interface allowed for 20 pixels of wiggle room while tgs old layout allowed around 300-400 pixels, at least for me. I should also point out that both light and dark theme while they share looks with chrome had an accident pages, also look like other websites dark theme, so If I have a page in the background that I see a bit of the edge, it looks like those sites. The old colors were completely unique to tgs. it's not so much a major issue, as it is an annoyance to unsuspend a tab by accident thinking its something else. . I am using dark mode\nLight mode is close to googles error when it shows an error happened, dark mode is close to the google isn't displaying a damn thing and is hanging hard \nFor reference I am using a 4k 55 inch tv as a monitor, I wanted multiple monitors, and this was the best I could do, that and tvs generally being better than most monitors at this point, so keep that in mind, \na big part of my problem with the color is this. \n\neach one is a different dark theme site/extension, and being able to tell them apart from the middle one which is tgs at a quick glance isn't easy. I generally have 2 pages open with a sliver in the background seen on a third\nPersonally, The original two color themes could be implemented as their own theme, like I said above, the original colors for the program are pretty distinctive, I also liked the upper section of the window with a different color, it helped, also, centered for the top bit would likely also be a good thing but its hard to say if its better if there would be 1 solid color. \npossibly a small gradient shift at the top or even user defined colors, though I don't know how much work that would be. hell on this part a user choice if there is a top part or not, if there is a gradient or not, how it connects with the bottom and a user defined color\nreally all I want is the old dark mode's color back anything more then that is just a nice addition as far as i'm concerned. . This is just my best guess as to what the ban is for as the site absolutely refuses to be specific.\nPart of this was about the ban, the other part was the massive load that this had for the better part of an hour where I had to kill quite a few windows because they just were not helping chrome be responsive. a 1 day in advance notification and I could have closed out almost every single suspended tab so it would impact me less.. I was using chrome at the time that it did this, and several of the tabs are 'volatile' as in once closed they are gone for good, as none of those tabs are gone, I can safely say chrome did not restart. \nthe problem with loading tabs suspended has been around for a while, when I do restart chrome, I have to load the program one window at a time otherwise everything will hang thankfully this usually means I load 1 window at a time, but in the case of the major steam sales where I will open windows in excess of 300-500 tabs, these can cripple everything for quite a while. \nI have no real idea what it did on update, but I did watch the program do about the same thing it does when I give it a massive amount of tabs to suspend. \nLooking forward to seeing the extension warn me.. No, Thought of haveing it turned on a while back but jpegs or png screenshots of every tab, which does get over 1000 at times, that just screams to me ram is going to be pissed away, but now with a 4k monitor and most of my windows being 1920x2160 the issue seems like it is going to get far FAR worse if I used that.\nI should probably mention I am on windows 7, ryzen 1700 32gb of ram going at 3000mhz (or what ever number ryzen assigns it as it doesnt like 2800 or 3000 as ram speeds) with a 1060 6gb, my computer also stays on for the better part of inbetween power outs or blue screens (power outs are mitigated by a ups now, but blue screens due to bluetooth have been happening, I think I got the reason sorted though) so my computer has been on for 39 days as of right now, with chrome being shut down and restarted once in that time frame, this has caused a few issues to crop up, the most noticeable one being chrome demanding 3.2gb of vram, so trying to get to the point I can shut chrome down and restart it is a priority now.\ngenerally on a fresh boot of chrome and after all the crap I want loaded is up, TGS is fairly fast, but over time, a suspend every tab on this page request can take up to half an hour to do, granted the fact I can do other things makes it an annoyance more than a problem, but the extension does slow down the longer chrome is used, or at least in my case, abused. .

At least this extensions does something similar: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mutetab/nmkbaaijgpppbokgnhhoakihofedkgcc\nI think there should be some kind of API for that. At least browser knows for sure which tabs produce any sounds and shows an extra icon on such tabs.\nSo, I think all tabs which produce sound non-stop should be automatically temporary whitelisted. They shouldn't be whitelisted if they produce sound only occasionally, though. For example pinned Outlook and Gmail web interfaces may produce sounds for new messages but if they set to be auto-suspended then they should be.\nAlso tab must not be auto-suspended within ~15 seconds after sound stopped to play since it could be due to internet speed, data buffering or switching between tracks in the playlist.\n. Well, ok but at least could you please make that top bar removable?\n. As I understood from deanoemcke  (look at his comment above) Chrome doesn't provide good screenshot API for the background pages. Also, I'm not sure that taking a screenshot to support an offline view is a good idea. We already have Instapaper, PageArchiver and a few other extensions for this purpose and they save the entire page instead of a screenshot of that page. So, you can select and copy text and use links when you are online. If I'm not mistaken ZipWeb is even capable to crawl a few links in depth and save them as well.\nSo, I wonder is it possible to save a page at the background if taking a screenshot of it is not an option?\n.

    "Corrodias": "I believe this issue can be closed. I have not seen any suspended tab urls in my history.\n. I haven't noticed any favicon problems in recent builds. Is this still happening for someone?\n. I'm trying the beta now. It's quite useful. I had one bit of odd behavior, where it kept insisting my session had crashed when I closed tabs or navigated somewhere. I would appreciate the ability simply to disable the whole session management behavior entirely; I have a session manager extension for that, and the suspended tabs appear to function with it just fine.\nBut I'd say it's release-ready. It's functional and useful in this state.\n. The session restore tab also pops up almost every time I exit an later launch Chrome, as well. That is with 5.46 beta 1; if there's a way to get a newer one, I am not familiar with it.\n. I cloned the repo and found that it can be loaded as an unpacked extension in the same way as the zip contents. The master branch still has the issue that the session recovery tab opens upon each launch. I'm not sure about the \"when closing tabs\" thing because I don't know exact steps to reproduce, but with a little bit of experimenting, I'm not seeing it happen.\n. It is set to \"open the new tab page\".\nSo I take it it's not easy to tell an intentional exit from a crash... and if the extension's ID ever changes, the old tabs can't be loaded normally.\n. @deanoemcke \nThat model makes a lot of sense to me. I will try it out today.\n. @deanoemcke \nIt continues to believe the extension has crashed when I launch Chrome, whether I have some suspended tabs or not. It doesn't when I \"restart\" Chrome via chrome://restart or a restart button. If there is anything else about my environment that might affect this, I can give you a list of settings or extensions.\nThis is outside of the scope of this issue, so perhaps we should make a new issue to continue this discussion.\n. The author is working on #155. While it isn't fixed yet, it has been improved, and only doesn't work (in my limited experience) in an unusual edge case. I daresay it could be on the Chrome store, and I'm curious whether there are any arguments against publishing it.\n. Used it at work today. I couldn't tell any speed difference if there was one, but I didn't see anything break. :)\n. Following up, I haven't seen any new issues pop up.\n. Testing results:\nIf I have no suspended tabs and exit Chrome, when I launch Chrome, the recovery page appears. It lists all of the tabs that I had open upon exit and no others.\nIf I have a suspended tab and exit Chrome, when I launch Chrome, sometimes the recovery page does NOT appear and sometimes it does. I haven't found a consistent pattern. Again, the tab list is correct.\nThe extension is the master branch, commit bb137f5..., \"Style tweaks\".\nOS: Windows 7, 64-bit. Chrome is also the 64-bit version.\nOn startup: open the new tab page\nContinue running background apps: unchecked\n. That is a familiar problem with the 5.46 beta on the front page, but as far as i can tell, it has been fixed, in the repo.\n. I was very busy today. Sorry! But tomorrow I should get to trying it.\n. It appears to work in the cases of \"no suspended tabs\" and \"mixed suspended and normal tabs\". The recovery page continues to open in the case of \"all tabs are suspended\".\n. As of 82c5616, or perhaps earlier, this issue appears to have been solved entirely.\n. That's not a bad idea. In the meantime, as a workaround, I suggest you either disable automatic suspending or, in the addon's menu, choose \"don't suspend for now\" before you begin working on a page.\n. Your post would be easier not to take personally if you didn't write it with personal attacks.\nYes, people request features from developers. Sometimes those features don't get made. This thread in no way forces the developer to comply with the request.\n. Do you happen to know what version it upgraded from?\n. If I had to guess, the restoration-on-update process only works if the version you're updating -from- records what tabs are open and the version you're updating -to- reads that record. If the older versions such as 4.74 don't record the tabs, then there is no possible change in a new version that will make it able to restore the tabs from that version.\nBut I haven't looked at the code.\n. Well, sweet. Thanks for being on top of this.\n. The automatic updating actually worked perfectly on my desktop: When the addon updated (to the hacked version), the tabs disappeared, but then a TGS tab opened asking if i wanted to restore the tabs that closed (under the assumption that it had crashed).  They went back where they were. It was great.\nNow, of course, it has been disabled, and I understand that I shouldn't enable it. Still, just thought I'd share that anecdote.. Well... yeah, they do that, because the update was published by someone other than the author, accessing his account illegally.. You can see the list of commits yourself on GitHub, here. Nothing is hidden. Folks - including the author -\n have supposedly done diffs with the contents of the extension and found no functional differences.. Yes, disable the extension. Use a session manager like Session Buddy to save your tab list before doing so if you are concerned about losing the list.. Read the linked issue for the current discussion. The only obvious change is the version number, but of course it can't be trusted.. Sure, I can answer that by quoting the readme file:If you were asked recently to accept new permissions, this is purely because you were upgrading from an older version of the extension to a newer one (v6.22). The extension has required these permissions to operate for quite some time now and is not related at all to the extension being compromised.. And as a long time user of 6.21, I can guarantee that that old version did require the same permissions.. ",

Hi. Could you please confirm the extension version number? I'm pretty sure this was fixed in the most recent version (v6.14).

    "seanlaguna": "There's a bug right now, especially Facebook (for whatever reason) is having serious issues. What version of chrome are you using, out of curiosity?\nI think the issues might have to do with the chrome sync stuff that deanoemcke added, or maybe the new gsutils stuff.\n. I'm talking about the beta version, newest version in repo as of a couple days ago, and yeah I've tested this on Chrome 37 and Chrome 38, running Debian Jessie/Sid. Not sure what the deal is but I have basically the same exact behavior that jusefe is seeing, but Facebook in particular seems to suspend within seconds and even while I'm using it! Maybe it has something to do with Facebook's dynamic page loading. It seems like a combination of the extension 1) not realizing that activity has happened and 2) not resetting the timer for suspending a page without activity. I had issues with pinned tabs suspending too even though my setting was to prevent pinned tabs from suspending. If you want me to provide you with any diagnostics let me know and I can do it right now.\n. I just did it and played around with the profiler. It looks like it's behaving properly which is great. I think the reason I saw the above behavior is that when the extension crashes via the Chrome 38 bug I posted, and I then reload the extension, it says that all the tabs are suspended and that the time to suspend is 0, even though that's not the case (only one tab tried to suspend, which crashed the profiler page and the tab that got suspended's page). Even restarting chrome after reloading the extension doesn't refresh this information, so maybe the extension gets confused and just tries to suspend tabs all the time.\nThe solution to this would seem to be re-initializing or re-collecting the tab data necessary to set this information correctly on extension reload...but ultimately the extension won't be crashing like this so it's not a genuine bug!\nAny thoughts on the Chrome 38 issue?\nedit I've been playing around with the \"never\" suspend option, so that I can have the extension loaded but without the crashes happening on Chrome 38. Are you setting the \"time to suspend\" variable to update relative to the current time? Seems potentially inefficient...maybe using a flag would be better?\n. So the Reddit Entertainment Suite is having some bugs with Chrome 38 too, it looks like they changed some stuff. Here's a link:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=393686\nMaybe this is related? BTW can you link the bug report you submitted? I'm curious to read about it.\nCould you point out the place in your code where you do this? I'm actually getting curious and I think I'm about to fork your repository. Dude thanks again for this awesome extension.\n. Hey so I wrote some code to use the encoded URL that you stored in the suspended URL to do unsuspension, allowing to avoid window.history.replaceState altogether, and it seems to work. The only thing is the suspended tab page does get stored in browser history...boo!\nA couple questions:\n1. How come you took listening off of suspended tabs? That would make it pretty easy to unsuspend tabs through a single unified interface inside of suspended.js, so it could be very consistent and all that code could be kept in one place, local to the suspended tab pages. I am very unfamiliar with javascript so I was having a hard time doing this myself, then I went and looked at your 23->24 revision. Maybe there's a good reason you took this out? It could be better to store the URL inside the suspended tab page instead of the URL, then load it from suspend.js using a hook whenever background.js needed to do the unsuspension. It's a tab-local task to do unsuspension, it would be better to do it that way. I do not think it is possible to update a tab from background.js without storing the suspended tab page in the browser history. Any ideas?\n2. If you click \"suspend other tabs\" I believe that tabs with form inputs will get suspended, even if the setting is checked to not suspend such tabs. I will open a bug if you or someone else can verify this, I've been mucking around with the code too much to be certain and I don't want to install an older version of chrome to test it there :^).\nGo take a look if you want: https://github.com/seanlaguna/thegreatsuspender. I'd love to hear if you think there's a better method than using the URL, or what you think of my comments above.\n. ",

How soon can we get this fixed?\n. Using 4.74, and as previously mentioned, even if it says 15 minutes, the suspension triggers right after it loses focus.\n. Guess you need to have it pushed to the store pronto. The method to get the beta version in is too risky for me, I have... um... 106 tabs. Unsuspending them all will murder my rig (currently with 8gb ram and lots of other shit on the background; if anyone's asking why I have that much, let's just say I'm keeping tabs on a lot of things that matter.)\n. This behavior is like how Firefox starts up when it resumes a session with many tabs. This would be a really big help.\n. ",

    "greduan": "@deanoemcke May I request the license to be a BSD-style license instead of the GPL?\nBSD-style meaning MIT, ISC or indeed the 2-clause BSD license. My suggestion being the ISC license.\nThe reasoning for this is that people that prefer BSD-style licenses often will not like to work with GPL licensed code, while GPL advocates wouldn't have a problem with BSD-style licensed software.\nThat's a broad statement and of course changes from person to person but I think it makes sense considering what both of these license styles promote. Of course both sides won't like to work with the other side, but the BSD-style makes it easier for contributors by a mile.\nJust something to consider. :)\n. Just my opinion, but at this point wouldn't it be easier to just suspend it manually as soon as you don't need the tab?\n. It is implemented now.\nI can select a bunch of tabs and see the following:\n\n. Guessing from how The Great Suspender functions, and also to keep the code simple, I think this is inevitable to an extent. :/\n. lol. Whenever I get to modifying this extension's code (as a fork) I'll see if I can do anything about it. That is, if @deanoemcke doesn't do anything about it. :)\n. Cool. Thanks. :)\n. At the time of writing this the jslint branch has been finished (from what I can tell). I will now move on to a loops branch based on the jslint branch and I will be re-writing the loops.\nThe jslint branch's purpose was to get JSLint working initially so that it can be used on the new code without old code's warnings interfering with the new code's warnings.\n. Also, after I do all of this I should be familiar enough with the code that I could become a maintainer if you liked. :)\n. > thanks for the interest in my project.\nNo problem. :)\n\nis the preference for .forEach() loops just to be more elegant? or is there some performance increase? i was always under the impression that for loops were the most efficient.\n\nFrom what I've heard, and I'm running a benchmark right now, is that the for loop is faster. However the .forEach() makes the code much more expressive, easy to read and to understand.\n... Yep. The normal for loop is faster. However from my experience it won't be a problem. The ease of development will be worth it. :)\n\ncan you also explain a bit what you mean by using iterative functions? an example of a part of my code that could be improved would be useful to help me understand :)\n\nWell to put it simply, an iterative function is a function that calls itself over and over until a condition is met.\nSo something like the following:\n``` javascript\nfunction iterative(num) {\n    num += 1;\nif (num > 100) {\n    return num;\n} else {\n    iterative(num);\n}\n\n}\n```\nSo it receives a num, and it increases num by 1. If num is greater than 100 then it stops there, if it isn't then it continues to call itself and the process repeats as many as 101 times. You get the idea? It functions like a loop but it's a function instead. :)\nA piece of code that jumps to me as a great chance for this is here for example: https://github.com/Greduan/thegreatsuspender/blob/jslint/gsUtils.js#L250\nOr at least it did when I wrote that line. Haven't thought it through. lol\nIterative functions actually take a bit of design and knowing how the language will behave, because otherwise you could have code that just goes on an infinite loop or it would be slower than it has to. When I get to it it'll be awesome, trust me. :wink: \n\nfinally, it would be quite nice to pull your changes back into my repo.\n\n:D \n\nseeing as it's quite a significant refactor, i'll try to hold off doing any commits to avoid inevitable merge conflict nastiness. let me know when you think most of it's done.\n\nFeel free to add new code. :)\nIf you could grab my jslint branch and add any new stuff to that, it would make it much easier for me to do the merge stuff later on and I wouldn't have any problem with it. :) Just make sure it passes JSLint. ;)\nDo you know of Node.js? If yes, are you familiar with it? If yes, how about Gulp or Grunt?\nVery important warning: If you plan on working from the jslint branch please make sure that everything works. I am pretty sure I broke some code at some point because of search and replace stuff and I wouldn't want you to make those errors a release. So please test everything thoroughly. :)\nEdit: You don't have to worry about this in the loops branch but always make sure. :)\n. An example of using the for loop vs. the .forEach() function for accomplishing the same thing:\nfor loop: https://github.com/Greduan/thegreatsuspender/blob/9cb7844bce86155f9e681a7b888bc97ed20c396d/background.js#L26-L33\n.forEach(): https://github.com/Greduan/thegreatsuspender/blob/96bea39ef8e9b2a58326c36edb036382a0fb1292/background.js#L26-L30\nCan you see why .forEach() is generally preferred over a for loop?\n. OK loops branch is done for the time being. You can work off of it if you like. :) I don't expect anything to be broken but it is always better to check. ;)\nNow going to the refactor branch. This one will probably take me a couple of days. Besides the break I'll take.\n. @deanoemcke Sorry to bother you but could you please explain what this function should do? https://github.com/Greduan/thegreatsuspender/blob/refactor/gsUtils.js#L136-L150\nI'm not entirely sure on what it's supposed to do so I can't really clean it up. Thanks. :)\nFrom what I can figure out, this would be another way to do it while keeping the code practically the same:\njavascript\n            for (i = 0; i < whitelistedWords.length; i += 1) {\n                j = whitelistedWords.lastIndexOF(whitelistedWords[i]);\n                if (j !== i) {\n                    whitelistedWords.splice(i + 1, j - i);\n                }\n            }\n. OK. For now I'm done with any simple refactoring. If I do any more refactoring now it would be re-writing parts of the code or re-arranging some big stuff.\nFeel free to check out my version. I believe it is at a stable state but I don't want to call it good before it's thorougly tested.\nI only use a couple of the features so those would be the only ones I could reliably test for now...\n. Ah OK. Thank you for the clarification. :)\n. > Why do you ask? I wouldn't have thought they'd really be applicable to a project like this?\nBecause I setup a gulpfile.js so you can run the gulp command (after installing it with npm install -g gulp) and it will run JSLint on the JavaScript files.\n. Ah OK.Thatps fine as well. :) You can use either but JSHint will be way more lenient.\n. @WoLpH You make a good point but it isn't part of Chrome yet unless you enable experimental features in order to get access to ECMAScript 6 (Harmony). Which I'm sure most users will not do.\nES6 is planned to be released in 2015 IIRC plus there's still the amount of time that browsers get to implementing all of it.\n\nIf you are going to use a \"modern\" approach\n\nActually the idea was to make the code easier to read. I had a big amount of trouble reading through all the i, ii, j etc., while with forEach it's much easier to parse, especially if used to JS callbacks and stuff like that.\n. @WoLpH https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/\nChrome 39 supports it but it has to be enabled via \"Experimental Javascript features\" flag. Also remember not everyone has the latest Chrome, with Debian users being stuck at version 37, while the latest are stuck at version 38. With the feature being available since Chrome version 38.\nPoint is, not a good idea to use ES6 features until it's a standard, which would probably be when all the browsers support it fully and then a couple of years for it to be a standard standard.\n. @deanoemcke OK, cool. Thanks for letting me know. :)\nI didn't do much testing with this so I did expect some stuff to be broken.\nThanks for your time. :)\n. @deanoemcke Something I just found out that you might want to be wary of.\nYou might notice in some of my commits I removed typeof var === 'undefined' and turned it into var === undefined or something of the style. I did this because JSLint was complaining abot the typeof so I removed it.\nI just want to tell you to be wary of the possibility that this breaks some if conditions. If you want to test if something is undefined then use var === undefined, if you want to check if something is NOT undefined then just wrap the previous statement in parentheses and add ! at the beginnning, like so !(var === undefined), so far it's the cleanest way I've found.\n. Not sure if this is possible but I can look into it for my fork. :)\nI actually want this feature as well and that's why I started looking into the code.\n. ",

I think the least recently used tab should be the one to be suspended. \n-edited to account for all new active tabs, not just newly opened ones\nHope that all makes sense. . @dumblob I edited my post to account for any newly active tab, not just newly opened.

    "zeel01": "There really are a lot of potential behaviours that this could entail. The question is, is there one specific behaviors that people can agree on as being \"the best\" and can be described to the user succinctly but clearly, or is there a way to enable the user to get the behavior they want or expect in a manor that isn't overly complicated.\nFor instance, personally I would like to see the behaviour I believe vede1 described originally, and I would want tabs that are pinned, whitelisted, playing audio, etc. to simply be ignored for the purpose of that behaviour. Thus the last ten non-special tabs that were active would be unsuspended, and the 11th most recently active non special tab would be suspended. The traditional \"suspend after x minutes\" would no longer take place, the ten active non-special tabs could be open indefinitely. And if a new tab is made active, an old tab will suspend instantly (assuming there exists more than ten non-special tabs).\nBut I'm not even sure that last paragraph explains the behaviour in an easily comprehensible way. Much less all the other possible behaviours described in this thread. The system of determining what tabs should be suspended, and the conditions under which they should suspend, may need to be conceptually reimagined to make this suggestion work.\nIn a way, there are a handful of different ideas here about what this extension is for, and how it should be used. And add to that, different degrees of need depending on the system the user is running their browser on. I use this extension on a machine that was able to handle over 600 unsuspended tabs before I ran out of memory. But I have also used it on a machine that can barely handle 5. Those use cases totally change how the extension needs to be used.\nHere is a (probably half-baked) proposal for options:\nOnline, plugged in, Automatic suspension behaviour\n- Timer: Suspend tabs after X minutes\n- Queue: Suspend tabs not in the \"active\" queue\n  - Basis: Age (newest tabs), last active (most recently used), least active (higher % of time viewed vs others in queue)... others?\n  - Length: Number of tabs in the queue\n  - Suspend delay: Minutes of being out of the queue before suspension, default to zero\\\nOnline, battery power, Automatic suspension behaviour\n- Timer: Suspend tabs after X minutes\n- Queue: Suspend tabs not in the \"active\" queue\n  - Basis: Age (newest tabs), last active (most recently used), least active (higher % of time viewed vs others in queue)... others?\n  - Length: Number of tabs in the queue\n  - Suspend delay: Minutes of being out of the queue before suspension, default to zero\nOffline, plugged in, Automatic suspension behaviour\n- Timer: Suspend tabs after X minutes\n- Queue: Suspend tabs not in the \"active\" queue\n  - Basis: Age (newest tabs), last active (most recently used), least active (higher % of time viewed vs others in queue)... others?\n  - Length: Number of tabs in the queue\n  - Suspend delay: Minutes of being out of the queue before suspension, default to zero\nOffline, battery power, Automatic suspension behaviour\n- Timer: Suspend tabs after X minutes\n- Queue: Keep a queue of \"active\" tabs that will not be suspended\n  - Basis: Age (newest tabs), last active (most recently used), least active (higher % of time viewed vs others in queue)... others?\n  - Length: Number of tabs in the queue\n  - Suspend delay: Minutes of being out of the queue before suspension, default to zero\nExceptions\n- Minimum Active Tabs: No fewer than X tabs will be active, Unless more than X tabs are active, timers and queues are ignored.\n- Pinned tabs\n  - Never suspend\n  - Exclude from queues\n  - Exclude from Minimum tabs\n- Tabs with unsaved form data\n  - Never suspend\n  - Exclude from queues\n  - Exclude from Minimum tabs\n- Tabs playing audio\n  - Never suspend\n  - Exclude from queues\n  - Exclude from Minimum tabs\n- Active tab in each window\n  - Never suspend\n  - Exclude from queues\n  - Exclude from Minimum tabs\n- Whitelist\n  - Never suspend\n  - Exclude from queues\n  - Exclude from Minimum tabs\nWhitelist\n[Text Box]\nSub-lists could be hidden when their parent is not selected, to keep the page as clean as possible. \n. I mean, yes. As a programmer, that would work for me. But now a lot of features are only really available to people who understand that kind of thing. Your average user would have difficulty with those settings. \nMaybe we need an \"advanced mode\" with that, and\n a \"basic mode\" containing default \"one size fits all\" options with basic configurations, which is implemented in terms of the advanced mode features. \nSo most users can hit a couple of check boxes if they do/don't care about pinned tabs.

An odd thing which I haven't figured out yet is that, for example, \"draft-balfanz-...\" is suspended, yet it is displaying the page title, as are some of the other tabs, tho those others don't appear to be suspended, tho I'm thinking they ought to be suspended because they've been sitting there > 15 min i think without my touching them. \n\nIn terms of which text ought to be displayed as part of a suspended tab's name, I request that it be configurable between the URI or the page title element or both -- this will aid in searching thru tabs using the tab-finding extensions.  it appears that TheGreatSuspender is using page title element? here's another screenshot:\n\nhere's another screen shot of trying to use \"tab menu\" to sort thru the tabs in a window where I have a bunch of google docs, and now I can't discern which tab is which when they are suspended :(   (I used to be able to!)...\n\n. @deanoemcke: ok, yes, upon unsuspend all and then resuspend all, the tab titles are available to the tabmanagement extensions -- cool, thanks.   \none new item: I note that the \"suspend other tabs\" and \"unsuspend all tabs\" commands apply only to that window and not to all tabs in all windows, which isn't immediately clear. \n. @deanoemcke: I instantiated a 'new' tab, in a window after doing the unsuspend all and then resuspend all thing, loading a resource not already loaded in any tab in any chrome window.  I let it sit and it eventually was suspended, and yes, it is displaying the proper title. \nre: \"the bug\" that is behind my initial posting above -- that's on the list to get fixed ?   :)     thanks.\n. @deanoemcke yes I was referring to the title not displaying bug -- and ok, i'll let u know if there's any further issues, thanks. \n.

    "weslymoore": "Same problem here.  Session saved 16 March 2015 with numerous open tabs, apparently (based on timing) as part of the extension upgrade.  Only a small percentage of tabs opened again afterward.  Links to reopen, export, save seem to do nothing.\n. I'm in the same boat - still sitting at 6.12.  I too have tried updating extensions manually from developer mode.  Can't begin to understand the update process here.\nIs there any way at all to review a list of tabs that were open and saved as a set in session history?  Even if I had to review and decide which ones to open manually, that would be helpful.  Otherwise I've lost 100 tabs that were open when the extension upgraded.  I do so much browsing, it's not possible to review browser history and find them in anything like a reasonable amount of time.  I do see the set of tabs saved in session history, I just can't do anything with it.\n. I had considered doing an uninstall/reinstall in order to get to v6.14, but I was worried about losing not just currently open/suspended tabs but the session history.  Is that a possibility?  Because as I mentioned earlier I do see a saved session from apparently just before the extension upgrade, which presumably contains the tabs that were open at the time, but the links to restore etc. do nothing.  I'm willing to upgrade to v6.14 if there's no worry about losing the session history, otherwise I guess I may as well wait for v6.15.\n. ",

It doesn't look like Chrome has pushed either upgrade down to me since 6.12.  I even tried going into developer mode and using the Update Extensions Now button.\n. @deanoemcke, @weslymoore's comment pretty much mirrors my situation.  I see under Saved Sessions what I assume to be all of the tabs I had prior to the v6.12 upgrade on 3/16.  If doing an uninstall/reinstall will make me lose that session history, I would be interested in trying your custom code to recover the tabs from that session or some other method that at least lets me identify what those were at that time.

I also run the Sidewise extension (for side tabs) and it remembers open tabs and allows an option to restore open tabs. But it didn't have most of them. I gather the issue is that the tabs become invisible to Chrome once this extension puts them to sleep. And it's gotta be the problem because I have Twitter windows in the exclude list and they all came back on restart.\nDisappointing that this is such an annoying problem since I have been very impressed with this extension otherwise.\n.

That's not rationalism - it's attacking people for no good reason.\n. This seems like a potentially viable option to detect developer tools being opened.\nUnfortunately, the alternative options you suggested don't quite cut it:\n- Temporarily pause suspension: I very frequently switch between developing and not-developing (specifically when working on scraping stuff), and it's very cumbersome to have to constantly enable/disable suspension, while also being very prone to being forgotten - plus, as I understand it, the pausing is global and affects all tabs, not just those being developed on.\n- Whitelisting: Works for developing your own site, but not for scraping. You're necessarily working on other people's domains, often many of them.\n. Yes. Do Chrome extensions not get the ability to inject code/behaviour into loaded documents? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something about how extensions work.\n. As I understand it, the code I linked can be injected into a page to detect whether developer tools are open or not. The extension could then use that injected code to automatically pause suspension for that tab when developer tools are opened.\n. ",

However, as mentioned at the start of this reply, I don't believe that this is necessarily an improvement - it would simply mean that tabs all suspended as soon as you come out of sleep. \n\nThis can pretty fine work for the use case at hands - users with long timeouts probably do not care when exactly their timed out tabs are disabled, right now, in 5 minutes, or all at once when notebook comes out of sleep. All they want is a passive process that decreases memory (and CPU on some greedy sites) footprint. \nSo, why not to combine both approaches: have a timer, which is most useful for short timeouts, AND have a background job, which runs both on timer (like 5-10 mins to not to consume too much CPU), and is restarted as soon as something weird happens like awaikening and chrome restart, and that job simply runs through all tabs and hybernates ones that have timeout expired?\nNote: imho, in case of background job, timeout countdown should not be restarted when the browser is restarted. Storing the last time the tab was visited should help. If that means, we should disable tabs in a bunch when we suddenly awake and see lots of tabs missing their timeout, so be it.. ",

    "kankaristo": "Just to play devil's advocate (in favor of keyboard shortcuts):\n1. Mouse isn't \"the only safe way\", you can always accidentally click the wrong thing, too (I accidentally click \"Whitelist\" all the time, when I meant to click \"Don't suspend for now\")\n2. As far as I know, Chrome extensions can't define keyboard shortcuts without the user being able to redefine them through chrome://extensions/shortcuts (an average user won't know this though)\n    - You can also use this to override even Chrome's own keyboard shortcuts (I've overridden Ctrl+S, because I never save a webpage as an HTML file, and I like using Ctrl+S as \"save\" for more useful things)\n3. Can't really argue with this (for average users at least), although some programs allow you to redefine keyboard shortcuts, so you can redefine these programs to use the same shortcuts for similar things (less memorization for each program's own shortcuts)\n    - Ctrl+Shift+Z versus Ctrl+Y for \"redo\" is a pet peeve of mine\n4. This is absolutely true, and it would be nice if The Great Suspender would show the keyboard shortcuts in its menu items (but I'm not sure if Chrome's extension API allows retrieving the user's keyboard shortcuts?). Duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/208?\nAnd according to that issue, it's implemented and coming in the next release.. I think the idea is to first find a fix for losing suspended tabs during updates before releasing the next update. I'm not sure how many people are affected by the bug in this issue, but 100 % of the userbase would lose their tabs with the next update. That's probably the only thing delaying a release.\nPeople would still probably lose their suspended tabs during the next update (I think this is unavoidable?), but updates after that one wouldn't break things.\nIn the meantime, you can download the Git version of this extension, where the bug in this issue is fixed (?). Or use the cookie workaround in the above comments.\nI agree with @liamjohnston that this issue should be locked (and closed, if the bug really is fixed). This issue is mostly talking about https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526 at this point.\n@deanoemcke could write a final comment with workaround instructions and Git version install instructions (most people probably won't bother with reading all of the comments).. I'd also prefer for this to persist through a refresh.\nSomewhat related: the \"Don't suspend for now\" button becomes unavailable if the tab is playing audio, which is a bit annoying, because I have to pause the audio/video, and wait a few seconds before I can pause suspension.\nAlso somewhat related: hotkey (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/208) would be nice, and would fix the above issue too.. @deanoemcke, fantastic, thanks! :+1:. This issue is about doing that for multiple tabs at once (the ones you've selected with shift+click in the tab bar), similar to how you can suspend/unsuspend multiple tabs at once. As far as I know, this isn't available for \"Don't suspend for now\".. The main purpose of the whitelist, in my opinion, is to stop automatic suspension, I don't want it to stop manual suspension (i.e. suspend all other tabs, or suspend selected tabs).\nSame thing for tabs that I've set to pause suspension (\"Not now\"), I only want that to stop automatic suspension, not to make it a pain to manually suspend multiple tabs.\nAnother option would be to have \"Suspend all other tabs\" to work the way it does now (whitelisted and paused tabs wouldn't suspend), and \"Suspend selected tabs\" would force suspend all selected tabs (ignoring the whitelist and paused tabs).

The volume in this player can be controlled by up/down keys on the keyboard. This effect does not manifest itself in players that don't have key bindings. It may also matter that the page with the player typically contains a lot of ads, in particular, sometimes - an ad popup window that's activated by the first click on the region with the player. However, I use AdBlock - it blocks these windows right after they appear, and sometimes even faster than I can notice them. So maybe this issue is related with the one in the topic, and it manifests itself on a page that's already loaded just because a popup window is activated on it by my click and closed immediately...

Also, TGS seems to work great with Tabs Outliner (crashed tabs are always saved), and you can export/import all your tabs (so it's somewhat a database export) by using TabAttack or Copy as Markdown (both are opensource).\n. Ok fair enough, but #365 isn't about detecting a request for another extension id, it's just that I used the Chrome App Store version of TGS to give my example.\nSo the specific issue (reload from uri) is already implemented in the git snapshot (I just tested it).\n\nHowever, my PR allows retrocompatibility with old TGS versions, since not only the link is encoded in the url parameter, but it's also HTTP encoded. Converting the url parameter to uri and the old extension id to the new one are easy tasks in any text editor when you export your bookmarks in HTML, but HTTP decoding each url parameter for every links is going to be a lot more difficult for most people (needs programming, cannot just use a regex!).\nSo maybe this PR can still be useful by adding a comment \"// Use url param for retrocompatibility\"?\n. Did you try the latest extension snapshot (by downloading this repo and using Chrome Developer mode for extensions)? Because it doesn't seem to happen on my setup with the latest snapshot.\n. No need to manual build a Chrome extension. Just download the archive, extract it somewhere on your computer, enable Developers extensions in Chrome and then you can just \"Load non packaged extension\" by pointing to the extracted folder (you need to point to the src subfolder). Works perfectly well, but you need to keep the folder, you cannot delete it or this will delete the extension in Chrome as well.\n. ",

Currently I have to unsuspend it to view the content below the end of first page.\nOption to limit capture vertical size is nice too.\nAbout memory usage - in my Chrome 15+ suspended tabs with high-res captures takes 85Mb, which is less than one modern webpage, so I think, using tall high-res captures will still save memory very good. As a plus it will be possible to avoid unsuspending pages to view hidden content.\nMore options are (I mean, for the far future):\n1. Overlay with plain text content of the page, without styles and/or markup, to be able copy some text from page (code snippets, links, etc).\n2.

Actually, js-renderer produces images with artifacts, not all html tags or CSS styles are supported, so may be it is possible to try to get series of raw screenshots using scroll, and after that combine them in one image?

Hi Dan,\nThanks for your reply. I think it would be a very broadly-applicable change to make, since it allows any other extension to make use of the suspend tab functionality by exposing the API. Thanks for the awesome work of making this extension, as it's saved me lots of system-resource-contention headaches in an environment where I open many tabs but don't need to work on all of them right away.\nI'll submit a pull request with the simple change necessary, and hopefully it's clear and simple enough to warrant a commit :)\n. :3 fair enough, thanks for your contributions!\n. I have ceased to work at the company that initially wanted me to develop an extension making use of this feature, hahaha! I ended up - at the time - using some kind of hack where I used window.open() with a URL in the pattern that the great suspender uses to symbolize a suspended tab (of course, that was an unstable API compared to this, so good to see it implemented!) . Any feedback from anyone able to approve this small change?\n. Hey deanoemcke, thanks for the reply!\nI've written an extension at work which makes all kinds of little modifications to web pages we commonly view, adds UI buttons, clears up the UI, and enables multi-step actions to be automated somewhat using javascript click events, DOM selectors, etc. We actually make heavy use of the great suspender plugin here as well, since our work involves opening many tabs and not necessarily working on them immediately. It would be great to be able to write an action for my extension which opens important tabs from a given source page, immediately suspending them. That's pretty much my use case.\nAs far as the changes made, they can be viewed as a diff to see that the original code is identical, except the same methods have now been exposed to external calls by supplying the handler function (given a variable name instead of just declared inline) to chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal().\nAt this moment, there's an open public issue in chrome 45 which is playing havok with our use of your extension (and was causing problems with my extension which uses chrome.runtime message-passing using tab IDs as well). \nThe bug results in all tabs receiving the message sent, rather than only the one with the supplied tab ID. The fix is said to be forthcoming in chrome 46. Until that release, I think you'll notice the great suspender is acting very strange, and tabs are getting suspended as other opened tabs, losing the original tab. \n. The diff, showing the simple refactor\n. This should be fixed if you upgrade to chrome 46\n. Strange, it seems to be working for me. Which exact functionality was not working? \"Suspend This Tab\"?\n. Ah, from looking at the pull request it seems \"Suspend Other Tabs\" was broken. It's also broken for me at the moment, using Chrome 46 and the The Great Suspender 6.19\n. ",

I lost all my open tabs too.\nThe reason is that since there are additional permissions, Chrome disables the extension as a security measure till we enable it manually. And since it disables the extension, it also closes all the tabs of the extension, i.e. all tabs suspended by the extension.\n322 seems to be the actual reason.\nThe solution, for now, is to allow the permissions, and enable the extension. Then go to this link (chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/history.html) and restore the last saved session from there.\nThe correct thing to do, for the developers, would have been to add the new permissions as optional in the manifest. Then open the options page on update, and prompt for permission from there. This wouldn't make Chrome disable the extension (thus closing all tabs), and make the transition easier for users.. @mcamou Do you have the extension enabled?\nIf so, go to extension's settings/options, then to Session Management, and restore from there.. > it cannot save a placeholder screenshot\n@deanoemcke I believe saving the placeholder screenshot is still possible with The Great Discarder. Showing it is another story.\nA way to save it may be to listen for autoDiscardable/discarded tabs in chrome.tabs.onUpdated, and then use chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab to capture a screenshot.\nThanks for the great extension!.

If this option were to override your current settings, how would I achieve this? Should I visit each of the 40 or so tabs I have to suspect only the current one?\nFrom usability point of view, it would make sense to honour the current exclusion settings and allow the \"Suspend this tab\" to override the settings. The tabs that are excluded are presumably far less in number than the total. E.g., I have 2 pinned tabs and 1 whitelisted tab and 1 current tab out of a total of 40 tabs. If I really meant to suspend all 39 except the current one, then, it would be just a matter of visiting 3 more tabs and using \"Suspend this tab\".\nI can still do that now, i.e., visit these 3 tabs and resume them, but I think the former is the more common use case to make it the default. Besides, there is also a danger of overriding the \"Do not suspend tabs that contain unsaved form inputs\" and cause me to lose my work.. ",

This should probably say \"Do not auto-suspend pinned tabs\" to be clearer.\nAdditionally \"Suspend other tabs\" should probably mention that it ignores all other things and really, really suspends all other tabs. No matter whitelist, pin etc.\nAnd alternatively, and IMHO most importantly there should be a button that really does \"Supend other tabs\" but still adheres to the whitelist, pinned tabs etc.. It's funny how e.g. Soundcloud keeps playing the music and even jumps to the next title in the playlist when the tab is suspended, but looses all context that it was playing something, what song it was playing and that I was casting this to my Chromecast Audio when I resume the tab. I wonder how casting is implemented to get this result.... Uh, this seems like a very specific hardcoding of one website's class.\nStill I like the general functionality. But maybe there is a way to find out which tabs are outputting sound and add a \"Don't suspend tabs that are playing sound\" option?. What I mentioned seems to be already part of the current, unreleased version in master: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/commit/2075fdc49692f6b9b4aab99ed58ffdd73f97a1e3. > I can see and scroll image.\nWhat does that mean?. Edge case, but still great fix.. Does the tab where the upload is running get suspended and by this the upload fails? Then your solution would be to whitelist the domain of this tab to never suspend.. > Instead, it leaves each suspended tabs with unusable links after uninstall.\nCan't you just click the page title that links to the page that is suspended?. Same behaviour as in left-clicking the extension icon?. To be fair: I didn't know there was actual functionality in right-clicking the extension icon.. Check the Chrome task manager. There you can see that the suspended tabs don't use the memory any more internally in Chrome. This is not necessarily directly linked to the memory usage in your OS unfortunately (but should still be reflected. Suspending all tabs should definitely make a visible difference).. Probably also fixed by #431, right? If so, I think this is the better PR for this.. Chrome also has a great task manager which shows memory and other resource usage.\nYou could probably create an extension that hooks in there and lets you disable tabs from there, or get the data from it out inside a context menu on tabs - but that would better be implemented in an additional extension and not in the main great suspender extension.. Not a bad request, but of course would make the \"Automatically unsuspend when tab gains focus\" label for this functionality quite wrong. \nIf at all this would have to be added as a new check box in the options \"Unsuspend when tab gains focus and stays focused for x seconds\". Which also makes clear that this would be misunderstood by many users and sounds a bit like an edge case.\nMaybe disable the existing option and use Ctrl+Shift+U keyboard shortcut when you focus the tab?. What is interesting about \"Tab Memory Saver\" is that Chrome Web Store says it has 4.1 million users, which is a lot more than the original extension. Is this data faked?. > Can you please explain why this doesn't seem to be the case?\nI think (! - not sure anymore...) after I noticed this problem (suspended tabs although I did \"Unsuspend all tabs\" and the \"automatically suspend after ...\" timeframe is not yet use up again) I saw all my tabs as active. Short time later some of those were suspended when I tabbed to them though.\n\nAnd is there a reason you use 2 minutes in your example above? Or are you just using that number as a 'for instance' ?\n\nSorry, that was indeed just a random number for \"short time frame\".\nShould the right now unsuspended tabs get their unsuspend timer reset when I use \"Unsuspend all tabs\"? Or should they indeed be suspended 2 minutes after I \"Unsuspend all tabs\" if they were 2 minutes from being suspended?. Yes :)\nThat was what I naively expected... \nBecause with the current behaviour a tab can be suspended until I get to it after using \"unsuspend all tabs\" which feels broken.. ",

I was able to get them back by restoring the indexeddb from a backup earlier that day. (I actually wasn't home to use my computer at all between when the backup happened and when all the suspended tabs disappeared\u2026)..

I know how frustrating it can be. However, your last comment is not appropriate. Dean has provided this awesome extension for free, and has been very careful to avoid this problem as much as possible. Chrome does not make it easy.\nPlease do not come to the github and complain and whine like that, as it is not productive.

However, your comments still offended me enough to come here and tell you to stop, I can't imagine how he must've felt.\nPlease, stop polluting this issue with your complaints unless you actually have something to contribute.. I tested both gmail, with a dynamic tab title, and reddit with reddit enhancement suite (maybe an old version of RES), with a dynamic favicon, and neither still had this problem.. google Keep randomly rearranges my note that has 400+ items in it, if more than 1 device is accessing the note at a time. Sometimes, I don't remember to close the keep tab on my home computer before leaving home.\nIf there is text entered, TGS won't suspend the keep tab. If I have TGS suspend it anyway, I might lose maybe 5 things I typed in maximum. that is significantly better than rearranging 400 items. So if TGS suspends Keep tabs after the idle period, regardless of entered input, it should prevent this nasty keep bug from happening.\nI agree, this does look like a dupe of #705 .\n. ",

    "RJVB": "\nthere's no way to identify which individual tab in that process is choking the CPU. So you'd have to suspend all tabs in that process rather than the one which is causing the CPU spike\n\nActually this may always be undesirable for you in your work flow, but \"MMMV\". Other users may find this less of a problem, and maybe the lumped tabs are all related one way or another. After all, if you don't want tabs to consume more than X% CPU unless you're working with them, what does it matter if they cause that CPU load on their own or together with other tabs, as long as non are being worked in?\nI think it's an interesting idea, assuming a mechanism can be implemented that keeps track of average CPU load per suspendable tab/tab group without causing too much CPU load itself so your other argument becomes moot. Not that I think that keeping track of average CPU load is that expensive provided you're already waking up periodically to perform house keeping.\nOf course the browser could do something similar internally, throttle down all tabs taking more than a given amount of CPU over the last X seconds when they don't have focus.\nYou could also implement an additional whitelist. Never suspend tabs taking less than X% CPU, so other tabs can be suspended more aggressively. \n. So are automatic updates now enabled or disabled?\nAlso, and this is a bit a shot in the dark: on my Linux machine (but not on my much faster Mac) I've been seeing an issue where I'd close unwanted (recent) tabs before quitting Chrome only to see them reopened when I relaunch the browser. Could that be in any way related to TGS's session management or some kind of interaction it has with Chrome's own session restore?.

I suspect it was because of this hack. Not 100% sure though. Just letting you know. \n\nIf I understand what has been going on, that can only be related if you actually loaded the account access page in the short time window that you may have had the compromised extension installed. The fact that an attempt was made to reset your password means \"they\" didn't get your current password (or else they could have changed it and locked you out).\n. I just disabled the extension on \"Ignito\" pages and got the \"uh oh crash\" page. Was that an actual crash or again something related to \"the issue\"?\n. Just lost my tabs once more and found the extension disabled on Linux.\nWTH? Some kind of notification when this happens would be nice, instead of having to wonder what happened to all once's tabs...\n. >not ideal, but perfectly acceptable workaround.\nLess so each time you have to go through the motions again...!\n. >Any update will cause loss of tabs, so it's impossible to pre-warn.\nI don't see how that would be so. A warning would be useful for those users who have an independent method of saving and restoring their browsing session; they'd be forewarned.\n\nAnd I feel like such a message would just cause general confusion anyway.\n\nMake it optional. Or use something here on github that interested parties can track (subscribe to) and where you announce pending updates.\nBut isn't there a way around this all? As a user I can tell the extension to unsuspend all tabs, what if you make it do that before updating, so that those tabs are no longer owned by the extension? I don't know if you can detect \"I'm going to be updated\" events, or even \"I'm going to quit\" but it seems the extensions API must provide something of the sort to allow extensions to clean up after them when the user disables or removes them.\n. On Thursday June 08 2017 09:00:53 Dean Oemcke wrote:\n\nThis is exactly the issue. The API does not provide any ability to detect \"Im going to be updated\" or \"Im going to quit\". \n\nSo doing an update =/= uninstall + reinstall? Sounds like a missing feature someone should propose to add to the API!\nSo how does regular session restore work?\n\nwarning, but then how long do I wait before pushing the update? Waiting less than a day, I risk most users not getting a chance to read the warning.\n\nA day should be fine for those of us always online (and thus probably most likely to be affected) but more will indeed allow more users to be informed. I wouldn't worry about users forgetting between the alert and the actual update; that's their problem.\n. \"Me too\".\nIn addition, I found that the extension had been disabled on 2 of my 3 systems (haven't checked the 3rd yet ) AND on the Mac there had apparently been a crash of the extension. That was actually what led me to the cause of the issue for I didn't get the \"has been updated\" window.\nOh, and Chrome/Mac claims that the extension has a severe known security issue?!. This happened because of an incident, not because it's part of the usual updating process.\nChrome does have a built-in \"kludge\" to do something comparable manually to what TGS does automatically:\n- open the Task Manager\n- select any of the processes corresponding to tabs that eat too much CPU or memory\n- kill them with the \"End Process\" button\nThis will kill the process but not the tab. You can reload the tab manually when needed, and it will also be reloaded when you restart the browser.\n. ",

My PC works fast no matter how many tabs is open, and if I have open only 5 tabs, the extension just do nothing.\nIf I press to manually discard all tabs, it will be work without checking free memory.. But I also like your new The Great Tab Discarder, because it unload background page from memory.\nSo it will be good, if you try to put this function into your code.. It's actually a free system memory, not a used.\nIn my case, availableCapacity  always provide same results as Windows Task Manager.\nMaybe it works an another way in UNIX, if you're using that..

During switch on the PC: At he moment chrome is opening automatically (I don't know why ?:-( ). then I have to open canaryby clicking the icon. only a couple (4 or 5 icons) are shown right. then I exit canary and start it again - all icons are there. overall I have 3 canary windows and one chrome window. I will now try the following: deinstall great suspender on both \"chromes\" (because of sync). restart the computer - stop chrome - open canary . I think your assuming is right\nwhat I did yesterday \n- update to canary 64 bit - > icons not working\n- deinstalled suspender on chrome and canary (because of the sync?!)\n- installing again - > icons not working (even more worse - icons aren't shown after restart canary)\n- loaded all tabs and disabled suspender \n- saved tabs and closed a lot of them \n- restarted and enabled suspender\ntoday morning everthing worked fine - all  icons are shown. I have 3 windows with 60 tabs. My estimation is that closing the tabs and the start with \"cleaned\" tabs was the solution - I will see what the weekend will bring\nin any case  - thanx for your time. me again - this was happened about 5 minutes ago\ncanary asked for an update - I have done  this - then I have to restart canary - after the restart 50% of icons are missing.\nsolution: I have to unsuspend all tabs and this FOR EACH WINDOW !  then it is working again. yes - by the way - this morning  -  everthing is fine. hi - good to know that it is  not only my setting. I think it will be automatically updated or do I have to install something ?\nthanx a lot - armin. I can confirm the \"tabli\" issue - all chrome tabs have the right icons - in tabli they have the \"suspender\"-icons - I'm using another extension called \"splitup\" - everything is fine there (second picture)\n\n\n.

    "mkz7": "Here is a related problem:\nTABLI is a great extension for quickly locating a tab. However, the same issue already dealt with regarding tabs in the tab bar not being easily identifiable also affects TABLI's listings, making identification of tabs difficult there as well (you have to hover the mouse over the tab in order to identify it).\nCurrently, my TABLI listing is full of many suspended tabs that are 'normal' (clearly identified) and others that display only those long character strings, with no identification of content.\nHope you may be able to do something about that -- or that a fix for the tab bar will carry over to TABLI's tab listings (seems like it should).\nThanks.\n\n. > UPDATE: I can confirm this DOES in fact now revolve around the code related to the Apply Chrome's built-in memory-saving when suspending option as shown here in video.

I'm using v7.0.109 (on a Mac). (Don't versions update automatically?) . > @mkz7 I looked into Tabli. The issue is to do with how their extension is obtaining the favicon to display in their list. If they were to query the chrome tabs api, they would be able to get the correct favicon, but they don't do this.\n@deanoemcke  Just received this from the developer (Tabli):\n\"Tabli \u2764\ufe0f The Great Suspender. A number of Tabli users also use The Great Suspender, an excellent Chrome extension that automatically suspends tabs you aren't using, freeing memory and CPU. This release of Tabli resolves a long-standing issue to ensure the correct icon and URL are shown for tabs suspended by the Great Suspender, and adds a little \ud83d\udca4 icon to indicate suspended tabs.\". v. 7.0.109 (Mac)\nTabs show the default icon (in all cases, to my recollection).\ne.g.:\n\nIt appears that it may be related to #719, although that topic appears to deal with an issue related to shutdown/restart, whereas most of the affected tabs in my case go into auto-suspend, apparently based on memory conditions, since I don't have the auto-suspend option active but do have the 'auto-suspend when on low memory' option active).\nThanks.. At the time that I experimented with 'suspend all other tabs' (i.e., with four different GDocs documents in four different tabs in the same window), all four tabs were open but static.\nThere wouldn't have been any form input active at the time, since all four tabs just contained a single line of text, with variations in the text intended only to distinguish them from one another.\nI located in Tab #4, then selected the 'suspend all other tabs' option.\nI saw the icons for Tabs 2 and 3 fade, while that for Tab 1 did not change.\nI don't have those tabs open currently, but in reply to your question, since Tab #1 apparently didn't suspend I assume that if I clicked on it it would react like a normal tab (i.e., establishing focus in that tab). \nDo new TGS releases auto-update or is it necessary to reinstall the extension via the Chrome Web Store (or other source)?\nThanks.\n. Thanks. No 'screen capture' -- I don't use it because of your warning about the addt'l memory it uses.\nI'll let you know if the issue recurs. That was the first time I ever used the option to 'suspend all other tabs'.. ",
    "CollinChaffin": "Commit 369cc38 today has gotten 100% worse and does the opposite of fixing this issue that I and others are having with suspended tabs being manipulated via other tools and not having the favicon.  I just updated to test and was really shocked to see that if I issue a single TGS command to simply suspend all tabs in the current window, EVERY SINGLE tab suspends with the blockhead icon - no favicon whatsoever.  This issue seems to be getting worse and worse I have not diffed the code from a few months ago and I realize a ton of other refactoring is much of the cause of these changes, but bear in mind this whole ongoing favicon refresh issue did not even exist a couple months ago at all and my tabs stored in any other session manager suspended were stored with the proper icon, as well as a live suspend of all tabs changed their favicons properly upon suspend, so perhaps we need to revisit that codebase.. Just to give you a screen capture showing how a manual suspend now of any kind simply does not set the favicons at all (as of today's current commit 369cc38) this shows me first unsuspending all tabs using TGS (which works properly) followed by the failed manual suspend that does suspend, but now performs no favicon set and only the generic blockhead:\n\nEDIT:  10-17-2018_02:38PM: I can confirm that the very latest commit 63a04dc from last night still renders the same results shown in my video above. :(. UPDATE: I can confirm this DOES in fact now revolve around the code related to the Apply Chrome's built-in memory-saving when suspending option as shown here in video.  Note how the issue completely disappears and the favicon is shown correctly in the very same session when I simply disable that new feature and re-run the manual suspension.  Note this also occurs with auto suspension.  Hopefully this helps you to track down the issue.\nDEMO:\n\n. Hey just wanted to report in initial testing that last night's commit 4e4d20e appears to have possibly finally resolved the favicon issues, even when re-enabling the built-in-chrome tab discarding!  From the # of commits the last few days it is clear you've been very busy!  Nice job!\nEDIT:  One correction:  All the MANUAL suspension actions I have tried, whether through the panel or context menu, and surprisingly even old prior suspended tabs in sessions restored through SessionBuddy now, after restoring, perform one last refresh and correct their appearance and do seem resolved.  HOWEVER--for some reason I just watched as a few tabs that performed an AUTOMATIC suspension wound up still suspending incorrectly to a blockhead icon.  Of note, after seeing the promising results from manual suspensions, I have once again been running with the new option re-enabled to utilize Chrome's native discarding which may still be impacting the AUTO suspend.  I will perform some more thorough testing of the AUTO portion later this AM and report back the results.. This is still not fixed as of commit e2d748c dated 11/14 even normal suspend operations are resulting in the blockhead generic favicon when that new switch for native discard is enabled. . Sorry @deanoemcke I replied on other issue but not here to confirm that as of latest commit things were looking much better and looked to be resolved (as far as this issue).  However, I see that just yesterday you committed what looks like some more significant improvements so let me re-test quickly here and I will return and edit this post to confirm still fixed.\nEDIT:\n\n. I too am seeing this and on my multiple systems the recent massive increase of Chrome RAM due to TGS in issue #646 I outline what I see causing it.. I just posted in my open issue #646   a workaround for this which I meant to post here for you as well:\n\nP.S.  Also, as a workaround for those with saved session either via other 3rd party extensions or TGS where TGS new versions will not recognize the suspension via old versions (root cause being the Chrome extension ID# changing) is this:  The \"unsuspend ALL tabs\" code must be doing a regex or other search (I haven't read the code) but despite the extesion ID#'s changing between Github build etc........a single suspended page via diff version will NOT unsuspend via click so the trick is....go to any active tab (this is only PER WINDOW unfortunately so will have to be done for each WINDOW with mult tabs) and then click the TGS button and select the \"unsuspend all tabs\" and wholla it will then magically identify the old version's suspended open tabs and unsuspend them now allowing you to restore the original site's URL in the nav bar and take control of them with new TGS moving forward.. Yes, it's this flag and a known issue past Chrome 62:\n\nenable-framebusting-needs-sameorigin-or-usergesture\nI'm very surprised you're saying you cannot reproduce, since the new default after 62 is to kill the very redirection that GS relies on, LOL.  Leave this framebusting new partial attempt at built-in ad-blocking in Chrome, protects against GS redirects to the new suspension page, which is what I show here:\n\nTo reproduce.  Ensure you're on latest Chrome DEV set the timer to few min and test it - even the latest Github build loaded unpacked 7.0.84, will fail to redirect SOME SOME SOME.  That is the issue - this is Chrome's new AI so sometime's the tabs suspend.  It is funny that one of the ones that seems to almost NEVER suspend, is www.google.com.  Open the main google search, perform a search, then switch to a different tab and wait the 15 min and you will see that tab will NOT suspend.  Go back to visit it and look on the right hand side of the omnibar and you will see this screenshot.  Disabling this \"feature\" via the flag I just posted here fixes the issue (for now until they force this feature on later).. More info for you on this new \"feature\" and flag:\nhttps://www.androidpolice.com/2017/06/01/google-confirms-will-block-ads-non-compliant-sites-chrome-starting-early-2018/\nhttps://www.androidpolice.com/2017/11/08/heres-protect-rogue-redirect-ads-right-now-chrome/\nhttp://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-chrome-ad-blocker-filter-how-works-coalition-ads\nEither way looks like you'll have to rewrite the way you redirect in Chrome.....eventually.  And instruct your users to disable this ad-blocking flag if they expect GS to work for the time being. :)\n. Just an update as of 03-06-2018 on Version 66.0.3355.0 (Official Build) dev (64-bit):\nThese issues still exist.  Clearly Google in implementing their own new \"let's fight all redirects\" code more than just the above flag which seemed to help for a bit and now wonder if it was until DEV channel updated again because now, it almost seems worse like almost 50% of my tabs do not suspend and result in the above \"redirect blocked\", whereas the other 50% for some reason Chrome decides won the lottery and allows a nice quiet redirect the way it always used to work.\nEDIT:  I just realized I am a few commits behind so I am pulling down the repo now to install the very latest code here to see if some of the very recent refactoring and fixes have had any impact.. How is that possible?  There are at least 3-4 other open TGS issues right now (#661 referenced above) all having this exact issue and I literally have a DOZEN machines all on v66 Chrome and 100% of them exhibit this.  In fact, I have just opened a Chromium issue as well at:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=822791\n**Anyone else also experiencing this that feels it needs DEV attention should visit that issue and STAR it so that it gains some DEV attention.\nAs this can easily be reproduced on a large scale.  In fact, I thought I already shot a video screen-cap for you, but if I have time later and this weekend I will be recording some actual video footage of this behavior, both for you here as well as the Chromium DEVs because this new anti-redirect code is just simply not ready for prime-time.  As I indicated in my Chrome issue, I literally downloaded 20+ free Solarwinds files, all from the exact same open tab in the same session etc. and only after a DOZEN normal downloads, did Chrome v66 suddenly out of nowhere (URLs to zips also did not change) began totally BLOCKING the download and placing the very same redirect block on the omni-bar.  Upon dropping down the warning on the omni-bar, the zip file url is shown and clicking it then proceeds to the download the zip just as it did the prior 12 items without Chrome feeling the need to \"protect\" me, LOL.\nEDIT:  If you want another non-TGS test, try to go to https://www.solarwinds.com/downloads and expand every section and fill out their form once (it then remembers for additional DLs) and download all the tools one at a time opening each one in their own tab from that base page.  For me, about half way through, Chrome v66.0.3359.26 DEV x64 began producing this:\n\nAnd once clicked (as you can see, that is the log consolidator ZIP):\n\n. EDIT:  I am now re-testing after you post (and after this fiasco of the push to everyone of Chrome DEV v66.0.3359.23 that rendered it totally unable to launch), and finally getting my systems to jump past to v66.0.3359.26, I had not admittedly re-checked every flag (they SHOULD stick), but not only is #enable-framebusting-needs-sameorigin-or-usergesture no longer enabled on these systems, but I see other flags like the experimental new V8 PARSER optimization have flat out now been removed and instead of falling back to the next best thing (COMPILER optimized), totally fell back to DISABLED as well. :(\nI'm curious in my open Chromium issue if they will confirm whether that flag really is supposed to be totally disabling this new redirection blocking or not.  I see several blog posts from Chromium DEVs from a while back that seem to indicate that this new feature is still in development and might not block all types of redirects yet so maybe the code really has not been fully implemented yet after all, it is a DEV build. :)\nI just really don't like it when it's this bad and on deck to hit the stable channel so soon so hopefully they get it worked out and TGS won't have to code around it, other than to perhaps indicate the user must set a flag etc.. LOL not rude but before posting things like this you may want to take exactly 30 seconds to research what you are doing:\nhttps://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models\nWhich very clearly states by those that by your own admission, DO know about Chrome (they wrote it):\n\"It is not a safe or robust architecture, as any renderer crash will cause the loss of the entire browser process. It is designed for testing and development purposes, and it may contain bugs that are not present in the other architectures.\"\nSo you are not only running your browser in a very unstable mode never meant for end-users, but you're posting on a 3rd party app that uses that browser how great it is to do so for it's other users to see and potentially attempt.  The only reason this APPEARS to give you a sense of stability is that you are smashing ALL of Chrome's plugins and other MANY processes into a single bucket and just because you win mini lotteries from time to time and it doesn't CRASH is absurd.  I run under the normal, fully supported multi-process (default) and can screenshot 381 open tabs right now spread over 31 different windows that has been a running session for many days - and I run Great Suspender and also do not crash, so my guess is this switch is more an indicator of other possible stability issues ON YOUR MACHINE which I would recommend you make your new focus.\nThis is also a nice way of saying to anyone else that read this open issue title and are considering trying it:  \nDON'T DO THAT.. ...and your bicycle is more stable if you bolt on the training wheels....and then walk/push it backwards, instead of getting on and riding it. :)\nAgain - read what the DEVELOPERS OF CHROME wrote about the single process setting - they wrote the code for that setting for TESTING, IT IS NOT STABLE, AND NOT INTENDED FOR ACTUAL BROWSER USE.  In other words, stop walking your bicycle backwards and get on and try riding it. :). Good news, it appears that your refactoring in 6c7865c has taken care of these errors.. As I had also pointed out in #704 (not sure if those logged errors are related) this is a real problem here as well.\nEDIT:  To clarify for the author - 100% focus is now forcibly stolen by whatever Chrome window specifically has TGS extension calling for a suspend operation - WHETHER OR NOT IT CALLS FOR ANY USER INPUT.  In other words - yes it might be a good thing if it wants to close a form (the above poster must have that option disabled since it should NEVER do that otherwise) but recently even quiet suspend operations now continually bounce Chrome windows to the front to the point of it being VERY obtrusive even to other apps.  And as I stated above and in #704 it does seem to coincide with these errors popping up recently so I wasn't sure if it was related.\nEDIT#2:  It appears that commit yesterday d2e17a7 has rectified the errors I posted in #704!. Correct I meant the \"undefined\" errors in my #704 were rectified with that commit but this modal focus-stealing behavior is now beginning to cause SERIOUS issues on systems I am seeing it literally steal focus and pop up chrome windows with, in some cases, STILL UNSUBMITTED FORMS and because the user was in the process of pressing the ENTER key on their MS-WORD when TGS stole the focus, their enter key literally has posted premature form data!  This issue should really be priority #1 right now with as many problems as it is causing.\nIn fact, I have to quickly add as further example, just as I typed this quick response, TGS has now interrupted me SIX times in a matter of only two minutes popping up three different Chrome windows that has tabs suspending.  Does the author use this extension and if so how is this not making him sit and swear out loud too?  LOL :). This was Chrome 69 (now 70) DEV on Win7x64 systems.  No flashing taskbar but absolute full popup, modal type steal focus from any other window/app.  Again, to describe if you have 5 Chrome windows open with 10 tabs each, minimize them all and then at the 15 min mark window 1 will pop open once for the 1st tab to suspend.  Re-minimize that window, and go back to another app - a few SECONDS later - rinse and repeat as the next 9 tabs on that window in succession as to being suspended touched last - suspend one by one.  Now, rinse and repeat that annoying popup from the non-Chrome app (as a pure example) NINETY-NINE more times (assuming you have all tabs set to be suspendable).  \nOnce you truly experience what I just described you will also consider this an absolute critical issue.  And, like I said above get caught hitting enter on another app when just one of the 99 popups in my example occur (which leads me to further explain) that when the first of the ten tabs in Window 1 suspended in my example, mind you that was NOT the active tab in Window 1 that just popped up meaning my caught enter keypress just went into a still ACTIVE tab in Window 1 (lets say sitting on an un-submitted form) and boom - the enter key just inadvertently submitted it.  Believe me when I say if you often have dozens of Chrome windows and HUNDREDS of tabs (the primary use for TGS to begin with), it actually is much easier than one would believe to have typing/keypresses being often now sent suddenly into unwanted Chrome windows in v69+ running TGS extension.\n. Win7x64 from Chrome 69 up to 70 this has been occurring, either with OR WITHOUT screen capture enabled (but usually I have it disabled on my systems).  I cannot find a system for some time that does not exhibit this issue but all my systems have been on late Chrome versions > 69 and I believe all Windows 7 or 10 based and x64.  From the comments above thought, it sounds like this may still be occurring with older versions of Chrome as well (but I cannot confirm at this moment),. @fwextensions That code throws errors on Chrome v70:\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'filter' of undefined\n    at changed.forEach.feature (<anonymous>:4:38)\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\n    at returnExperimentalFeatures (<anonymous>:3:13)\n    at <anonymous>:1:1\nI did figure out a way to dump them all but it's a bit ugly and am just working on cleaning up the code to filter out only the non-default values.  If you come up with a way first go ahead and post it and I'll use it.  I do have some flags set none that I can think of that would ever PROMOTE (more than default) the ability for anything to command window focus.  Again, this is on multiple Win7 systems and I cannot actually produce one using current Chrome DEV v70 that does not exhibit this very problematic behavior.  If it turns out to be a flag I will certainly jump for joy but I also have not changed any flags since this issue began so I will frankly be a bit surprised it if is.. Hi @deanoemcke  I swore I opened an issue on this already a LONG time ago amidst numerous other issues, and it turns out I did and I apologize for not getting back to it.  As I double-checked I came across at least one other that is clearly due to this - issue #791 if you look his 4th tab not suspending is his active tab.  This is because the option Never suspend active tab in each window simply does not and HAS NEVER worked - period.  No matter what build of Chrome or TGS I have yet to I think ever see my active tab suspend, even with that box unchecked.  I have rechecked it to then uncheck it thinking it was stuck etc.\nTesting has been performed on various builds of Chrome/Chromium with various builds of TGS, up to the very latest commit 7ad3174016e6a7527993ac224a599ef389458a97.  Testing consisted of reducing auto-suspend timeout to 20 seconds to speed testing (other timeout values were also tested).  All other Chrome/Chromium extensions were disabled.  Various tabs were opened, ensuring none had active forms/form input.  Tabs were activated at random intervals and finally a period of 30 seconds was allowed to pass on the last active tab.\nThe results were the same in all testing.  Despite experiencing the various previous bugs related only to the TGS icon display, in 100% of the cases TGS properly suspended every tab EXCEPT one - the active tab.  There was no test that resulted in auto-suspension of the active tab being displayed.\nLogging results show the active test tab is always flagged as status \"normal\" and not as a inputform as shown here, and as you can see the final active tab can be left for eternity (with the 20sec timeout I let it sit for hours and this is what is in the TGS debug log):\n\nIs this a case of code is negated via an incorrect double-negative?\n//active: a tab that is active (and IGNORE_ACTIVE_TABS is true)\nOkay let's trace where that value is set.\nThe IGNORE_ACTIVE_TABS is a boolean.  The question on that boolean checkmark says \"NEVER suspend - BIG NO TO SUSPEND ACTIVE, check this if that's what you want\" - so I UNCHECK it because I DO want active suspended - making the boolean value FALSE.  So, let's apply that to our action of \"Is it true that you DO NOT want to suspend active tabs?\" which is now assigned that FALSE.  Perfect and correct.  Now comes my question which is why I believe somewhere the code logic around it is coded in a way that this also seems a bit backwards how it is being set.  Since we now have our dontSuspendActiveTabs set to FALSE (meaning simply DO suspend them), this code then sets:\nvar dontSuspendActiveTabs = gsStorage.getOption(\n      gsStorage.IGNORE_ACTIVE_TABS\n    );\nI don't know how much more complex a simple \"SUSPEND_ACTIVE\" boolean of TRUE/FALSE can be, LOL..  Because when you check the box on the options form, according to that code it sets the value of dontSuspendActiveTabs and is NOT negated but correct  and simple - I now UNCHECK it to set to FALSE.\nBut what happens when it's read back in via gsStorage stored value:\nIGNORE_ACTIVE_TABS: 'gsDontSuspendActiveTabs',\nSo for me, here is what I believe is the root cause - IGNORE_ACTIVE_TABS is now set to FALSE based on the above line when it's read back in - meaning instead (because of the double negative) DO suspend the active tabs - the exact opposite of what it is supposed to mean.\nOutcome:\n\nMy head hurts\nActive tabs don't suspend\n\nMy guess as I continue to debug is that the code is such that it then is acting more logical than the above, and negating it once more which is why the code as shown above via gsUtils logging is that when it comes to that value and active tab, NO code ever fires.  I say this because if it were only a single reversed value I should be able to instead set that value to checked/true and see activity in the log - and I do not.  It simply NEVER does ANYTHING to the active tab in my testing.\nNow that I taught myself your gsUtils logging and I've shown it above, could you now either provide me a way to provide you additional info (I think I'm taking considerable time already providing good detail) and if there is any recent demo showing the active tab suspending and the options etc. it would be helpful because this has been broken a very long time and others are complaining about it too and I am trying to assist but you know your logic on these things better than anyone.  I can certainly submit another PR but really look at the above and try to understand how as a DEV myself, those double negative values simply don't seem to compute so I have no idea how it could be working.\n. OMG I've been updating the wrong issue.  Please see my last few comments/info I just posted today over on my other open issue #843.\n. In addition to my comments I posted over in the wrong issue (#843) as I believe it should answer your above questions so please read those first but I also wanted to show you first hand what is happening here. Note that I sped up the playback when I converted slightly for your benefit but this also makes the 20sec timeout obviously shorter:\n\nHopefully you can understand my frustration.  What is the easiest code change I can make to have it provide the reason WHY the tab is not eligible for suspension?  That would help a lot in getting to the bottom of why as you can see, when active it 100% thinks tabs are not eligible but once switched focus, those same tabs suspend without issue automatically.. Doh!  Double-doh!  Can I ask if you've considered though the cases where if you know you have this extension, and knowingly set away from the default (which is to never suspend active), that after reading a tab and walk away from the computer, that with a 1-hour suspend for example instead of Chrome sitting active with it's background processes potentially running on the active (now let's refer to it as VIEWING tab) -- that it should be an option, whether being included as part of what today is constituted as \"active\", or whether it is added as another checkbox for \"current viewing tab\"?\nI'm certain you're aware since you created this extension, but many people are not as to just how active Chrome really is when left on an active tab.  Just open taskmgr load the I/O columns and a single tab to www.google.com and be amazed at how much Chrome winds up reading/writing to cache and using CPU for it's internals.  This is even more so with the new \"simple\" caching.  As someone who has personally now literally has not one, not two, but THREE new SSD's of differing brands DIE largely due to (and before using TGS with more aggressive timeouts) Chrome and having recorded this video demonstrating Chrome sitting IDLE with ONE tab open yet when added up, consistently performing 25-100 GIGABYTES of SSD nand WRITES PER DAY:\nhttps://youtu.be/Rydy1bb0ApM\nThe upshot it you're absolutely correct in that I understood the \"active tab\" setting to include the actively viewed tab.  With that said, I would ask you take a look at this video if you're not already aware of just how hard Chrome is on a SSD in that case of having just that one, single, viewing tab never suspend.  If it is an hour after I'm done reading it and have had to walk away from my system I would sure love it for TGS to still suspend assuming no active form input.   In my testing with this I noted that TGS does already detect and register clicks inside the \"viewing\" active window, so simply using that as the timeout \"activity reset\" the same as screensavers do it, then even with a 15 min setting when I'm reading a tab I certainly have to click on something at least every 15 min, anyway, so doubt I'd get many unwanted suspensions even set to 15min.  I think you'd find it would be a very welcomed (and if you took a poll I would bet commonly enabled) feature/option and having looked more at the code guessing it would literally only take a few lines of code being changed to implement.. Sorry missed your last response looks like this last commit addresses this?  https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/877. Nope, I do not have that enabled and never have.  I have tried with and without the new other option of Apply Chrome's built-in memory-saving when suspending however it has no effect.  I'm opening a third issue now on yet another bug I've found on this latest commit you guys are doing great on this it must just be a bad string of luck on these.  Let me know what else I can try it would certainly be helpful to perhaps look at adding an additional (even hidden on the about page etc.) of a checkbox to enable debug logging to help really narrow these down quicker.. See #478 \n\n. It does appear in today's commit 238bfa1 that when I save a session of many suspended tabs with TGS, then restore them (with SB), that it is again restoring in the original stored order so let's close this one for the time being.  Thanks!. Sorry missed your question until now and we are far past that version it is still the same in today's commit 63a04dc, WIN7x64, Chrome x64 DEV 71.0.3573.0 although this has persisted now through multiple versions of Chrome x64 and TGS.  This is dangerous because it's now to the point that it's actually changing the underlying behavior of the web browser and forcibly re-opening 100% of the last session upon every restart, without any ability to even disable the behavior.  The good news is it does not sound like from your comment above that it is by design intentional (although TGS has always offered OPTIONAL session management that was totally passive).  I have never had any issue with TGS storing my session data however - and you may want to just throw this into the back of your head - IF I had been at any time offered a single \"disable\" switch on the session management tab, I would have and with it probably reduced the overhead of TGS substantially as well as ensured this COULD not happen to those of us not using that feature to begin with.  Regardless, you obviously don't want TGS users to need to lend serious thought into the full state of your entire browsing session and all windows/tabs before clicking the \"exit\" each time knowing that ALL of it will start back up at the same time when you next click the Chrome icon for a quick single-page lookup. :)\nI can certainly also create a video of this if you need it but I'm guessing you understand what's happening here.  I can tell you that it also just happened when I did a very minor 1-2 commit update without any kind of database compaction etc. and I NEVER EVER let ccleaner delete anything but cache and non-approved cookies (when I run it).  I do not clear session data, history, download history, OR ANY EXTENSION DATA. it is literally those 3 things, general cache, cookies, and do a database compaction which does I'm sure flush any uncommitted journals.  I thought it might be related but it seems to be happening even when I do not run it.  Either way, I have trouble understanding which of those (if any) would suddenly (and not for the last YEARS I've used it) be causing TGS to now believe a crash occurred and restoring like this.  And, since others are getting any kind of TGS tab popups on every Chrome start, just spit-balling but sounds like some code is causing it all. :)\nFor the record, when I do run it, these are the few options I even activate:\n\n. This continues to happen I can shoot a video but here is what the video is I cannot understand how on earth this is \"difficult to picture\":\n\nClose Chrome with TGS enabled - no crash.  Chrome set to open to blank NTP (which is does until TGS restores tabs).\nOpen Chrome:  Bug/New behavior/root of this issue=TGS even displays it's branded \"please wait while your session is restored\"....and all my tabs from the prior close re-open.  \n\nI'm confused, do you really need a video of that?  How Chrome looks closing and opening and how the TGS \"I'm restoring your session\" looks?  That's TGS in action doing a session restore - just one I didn't order.  I will if you need it but as a DEV myself no idea how that could possibly help you.  Can I ask about all these (probably a dozen+) commits specifically for \"improve logging\" are?  I have not read the code but I've been watching them appear for months is there truly still not a way to enable ANY logging in TGS that can instead prove through basic logging what I keep having to spend time shooting/editing videos of that others also confirm is happening with a simple enable of debug logging?  I ask because to date in all these issues despite all these \"logging\" commits, you've still never instructed me once on how to collect ANY logs, or even indicated TGS is producing any.  I myself would also find it incredibly helpful in troubleshooting to have a TGS log to see just what TGS is doing as it initializes, and what it's parsing when it believes I crashed when I didn't and begins it's session restoring.\nSorry for the frustration but is seems like you've questioned almost every issue I've even stated was also happening to me, or ones I was first to open that I finally then have to waste the time to shoot videos to prove it, and clearly you must see there has been something to so far EVERY single one I've opened since there has been probably twenty or so commits specific to trying to fix what I think now you realize is/was a serious issue in the new code refactoring with and without the built-in Chrome discards, since as of last night all had finally been fixed to at least show favicons EXCEPT in the most important one - the automatic \"wait 15 min\" suspend which is STILL broken.  I also shot a video of that over in issue 478 (several, actually) to back up what others had already reported.  \nThis issue #781 is simple - clearly you're doing something to change/enhance (it wasn't broken or lacking that I could tell before) the quiet session management/recovery be it for enhancements or just due to your refactoring.  Two months ago, I had literally NEVER ONCE seen the TGS session restore, nor manually utilized that entire feature.  Now, EVERY TIME I open Chrome, I have a totally unwanted feature of TGS forcing itself on me restoring tabs.  I don't want that.  I had no issue with the feature being there, but it never forced itself before so if this is now the norm to forcibly open tabs at Chrome startup, whether I execute ccleaner at all or not (it just happened when all I did what close Chrome, wait 10 seconds, and re-open it) then please wouldn't it be easier for YOU to add a simple enable/disable killswitch (checkbox) at the top of the session management page so those like me that don't even use TGS session management can disable it?  Then if we need to report an issue to you, our report automatically eliminates half the code-base dealing with sessions not to mention all that code overhead that never would need to execute.\nAs a DEV been doing this over 30 yrs I also often have taskmgr open anyway, watch ALL chrome tasks die off when I gracefully close chrome (if I run ccleaner it won't even execute if Chrome is active) but regardless of if I do nothing but re-start Chrome, or clean basic cache, TGS is doing something it never did - just like all the other recent new behaviors we've been struggling with.  Hopefully you can instruct me on how to enable some better TGS logging.\nNone of my settings have changed - TGS has. Here is my startup:\n\nI do not (nor EVER have) allowed Chrome to continue running.  When I click \"close\" - 100% all CHROME.EXE tasks gracefully terminate per taskmgr:\n\nEDIT:  Full few minute video attached showing one round of TGS startup session issues.  This round, I got the dreaded \"crash restore\" from TGS allowing me to choose to restore, despite it clearly being REPEATED clean graceful Chrome shutdowns with only TWO tabs open and suspended.  You can see how repeatedly TGS reports it has \"crashed\" despite no other indication of crashes (I think this is simply another code bug with the refactoring and discards) - but either way hopefully you believe me now and can indicate how we can gather some/any REAL logs from TGS. It seems that much of the time, TGS just shows the \"success\" after restoring without even prompting, as you can see here that I tried closing Chrome with ALL suspended tabs, then with some unsuspended and at least in this test it did not seem to matter.  Again, buggy and no rhyme or reason but now it a 2-min video you can see the headache I now deal with daily with TGS in this very REAL issue:\n\n. Hey @deanoemcke Dean!\nI wanted to follow-up to let you know between the last round of refactoring and commits, and the Chromium issue below that I opened (and they resolved by reversing a bad commit) that also I believe may have been contributing to at least some of the extension crash behavior of TGS (it was with a few others very badly) and that things are looking better regarding this issue and I'll close it out to let you work on some of the other ones that have been rearing their ugly heads up yet again (namely your favorite, the favicon refreshes, LOL!).\nThanks for working this one in with the others!\nMultiple extensions suddenly crashing repeatedly/frequently\n. Update, I am no longer seeing the \"crashed\" message I recorded which I believe was caused by the Chromium regression that was fixed, however I am unfortunately still seeing TGS merely re-open sessions almost randomly without anything other than the TGS window/tab flashing that says that TGS is \"please wait while your tabs are restored\" and restoring the entire last session without asking.  What is odd is then the next reopen it will not so perhaps there is still a crash of some kind being detected (right or wrong) by TGS behind the scenes but without any debug logs I still have no idea how to help troubleshoot further.\nNote this is with DEV build but since that is not as far from stable as Canary it is worth mentioning if we do nothing it could become reality very quickly - so if we need to get the Chromium team involved again just let me know how I can help!. @deanoemcke I just tested and it looks good I think you finally nailed it!  Thanks!. Yes could be duplicate - but no, not fixed with latest commit 238bfa1.  I saved a number of tabs that were suspended as I always used to in my session manager (Session Buddy) that simply saves each tab with it's URL (in case of suspended it is the suspended chrome:// extension of TGS).....restores fine.  The issue is somewhere in the last couple weeks the refresh code changed and now, they all have no icons and just the generic blockheads until each tab is manually clicked upon as shown in my post above.\nI do want to reiterate that this all worked 100% fine a month ago back years and only broke recently.  The same goes for the other couple open issues I have right now they all began in this latest round of code improvements.\nI'm still testing the other issues to see if those are resolved.  I have not diffed the code from a month ago to even begin trying to debug how it was refreshing the tabs on initial load/refresh vs today - but I will here over the next day or so to try to help.. I want to add that not only is this an issue, but just plain old \"wait 15 min and watch a tab suspend\" results in that tab's appearance now also matching what I've stated above - a plain blockhead icon tab with no proper favicon that usually is set upon the suspend process refreshing the tab title/icon to match what it was when live.  So it is not only in that loading/refresh process not showing the favicon anymore, but also not in the case of a normal simple suspend->set/refresh title->set/refresh favicon based on whatever suspend timeout the user has chosen.. I don't know if this is related but this forcible auto-restoration of my last session anytime I simply clean the cache using ccleaner sure seems to be related.  TGS NEVER did this until recently I fully understand it has it's own session mgmt but PLEASE PLEASE at this point since it is obvious there are and will be continued efforts to make the session management more robust add the one CRITICAL missing setting that has always been missing (but never really mattered until now) - A WAY TO OPT OUT AND DISABLE IT.  I love TGS, but frankly already use SessionBuddy for a far more mature session management so in the near term will never use TGS for session management but it is tied with SB as my number one extension for what it does best - suspend tabs and save me from myself when it comes to browsing practices. :)\nJust a single checkbox to disable all session management and continue to allow TGS for suspensions - pretty please!. Usually would not chime in when an issue has been answered, but since I am not only a DEV myself for 30yrs but also a loyal serious power-user of TGS since the initial release.  Admittedly I have never done serious Java/JS work on the professional side as it is not my preferred language, but like most DEVs can certainly read other languages if need be.\nWith that said, when I look at closed-source extensions that absolutely HAVE been proven to be secretly malicious, uncovering those takes serious work as almost always not only is their original source code not available to review, but it then requires decompiling and reverse engineering those sources, just to then begin the time-consuming, daunting task of tracing the code.  The HUGELY popular Chrome Extension, Stylish, is a perfect example.  I had already done some of this daunting work and had already been warning folks not to use it and now we know just how deep that rabbit hole went.  Then, look at Stylus, an extension that does the EXACT same thing - but posts 100% of its code on Github for the world to review (and better yet, be able to contribute to help improve it).  I know which I personally trust. :)\nMy point?  I am in no way saying you will NEVER find malicious apps/extensions with full source code online, but I have never seen one that still wasn't seriously obfuscated (unnecessary if you're truly open-source) to hide their true intent.  And why?  If you were laundering money, would you DARE to post your financial ledgers on the internet, opening yourself up to even the POSSIBILITY that a CPA would quickly shed light on your activities?  Of course not.\nTGS is a perfect example of a true Opensource effort, with 100% of it's source code available, and NOT obfuscated in any way allowing anyone who can even read code to peruse through it at any time, day or night and they also welcome code contributions.  Just spit-balling but I'm guessing as popular as this extension is, it wouldn't take but hours for something to be identified in the code that should not be there (including browsing data collection).  I know that personally, I have had no issues calling out obfuscated code where it should not be (in other apps NOT TGS!) and quickly bringing bad intent to light and any good DEV usually will do the same as to do our best to eliminate those that give the industry a bad name.\nAgain just my opinion but I make an attempt to read through the code initially of an Opensource project I then look at longevity and # of participants and cannot remember ever getting that far into that process and finding it to be malicious.. Certainly agree with your points in fact it is funny you say that as I was posting over a EIGHTEEN MONTHS ago in many places including different repos here on Github (https://github.com/StylishThemes/StackOverflow-Dark/issues/44) because a legitimate marketing company is who quietly purchased Stylish, and their privacy policy was immediately altered to flat out state they could(would) do as much, so I was surprised when folks were so surprised to find out they then took advantage of it.  And, in agreement that is why the policies are important at least those that are honest and legit enough to post them as they do demonstrate intent.  IMO the TGS policy is out there and pretty straight forward and with their totally un-obfuscated source here I personally am not at all worried.  :wink:\n . Duplicate of https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/762\n. @tonsimple you perhaps should catch up on reading open issues since everything you've mentioned in this issue you opened has been opened and/or already implemented for some time particularly the \"AWOL\" favicons there are actually multiple issues open on it.  \nHowever, as for large session restores, what are you using to save and restore these large sessions, another extension or TGS?  If it is another extension I speak from experience it it 100% dependent on the state all your tabs are in AT THE TIME OF SESSION SAVE.  Because, a saved session with 300+ tabs (a minimal norm for me) even on an older laptop are re-opened upon a manual session restore using a 3rd party ext I use in a matter of maybe 10 seconds with the same little overhead as when I closed Chrome - BECAUSE THEY WERE MOSTLY/ALL SUSPENDED.  If you're restoring suspended tabs, the URL is a local/internal chrome:// url for TGS, so it is impossible they are consuming much of anything, since nothing has actually loaded until you click on each.\nNow, on the other hand if you're saving the state of your 300+ tab session with NO SUSPENDED TABS and all live URL indicators to the internet......that too has NOTHING to do with TGS (why would it if they aren't suspended via TGS?), instead that action relies solely on Chrome's abilities and there are actually non-default flags you should look into to make that less painful although I not only cannot imagine doing that to my system at every restart, but I speak from experience it does NOT take all that many open Github tabs restoring ACTIVE all at the same time before GH will begin issuing a quick rate-limit ban of your address, and if you keep doing it you can risk similar and even more serious permanent action from them or any other site that has sensitive DDOS measures in place and doesn't like being hammered.\nI do worry when I see someone posting that a specific extension \"crashes or hangs forever\" without providing any detail of crash messages, screenshots, etc.....I've been a power TGS user for years and I don't think I've ever once seen Chrome report TGS specifically being hung or \"crashing\".  Not that I don't believe you but what makes you believe it's TGS \"hanging\" and also what exactly is reported to you at the \"hang\" or \"crash\"?\n. FYI I myself wrote an extension that opens new tabs at the end of the row - is that what you are looking for?  Normally Chrome opens new tabs next to current without anything, so I'm wondering if that extension is really supposed to open tabs at end of row (old style)?  I ask because that is exactly what my extension does, and mine has no issue running with TGS I run it together myself on all my systems to open new tabs at the end of the row:\n. I really wish I had seen this sooner as I have wasted HOURS on this darn issue which still plagues numerous commits all the way through today's (12/12) and I believe has rendered the entire TGS broken again without the ability to even initialize at this point.  What commit are you currently running now have you updated since 12/4 build?  I ask because despite this fix never been put in, with all this refactoring the errors are like a moving target and now all the code has been moved to different files (gsFavion.js etc).. Thx but this latest build has multiple refactoring changes and that is only one of the errors I am seeing but if I can put my finger on the issues I'll post back here.. Nope TGS is now totally broken throwing this error upon any suspend operation as I indicated in open issue #823 that has been open for several commits now without any acknowledgement from @deanoemcke hopefully he is working on it:\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'queueTabAsPromise' of undefined\n    at queueTabForSuspensionAsPromise (gsTabSuspendManager.js:49)\n    at Object.queueTabForSuspension (gsTabSuspendManager.js:35)\n    at activeTab (background.js:427)\n    at background.js:176. It appears this is still an issue but with all the refactoring and with numerous other cascading errors that appeared unrelated (but were not) was a PITA to track down but I finally have and it tests good even with latest DEV/Canary builds.  I'm creating a PR for it now hopefully Dean can get it merged soon.. Well I guess based on comment 23 here we shouldn't feel bad for this being such a PITA:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=409090#c23\nI also referenced a few other links in the PR including that this very ~~bug~~/issue has been presented to Chromium team numerous times and finally declared WontFix here:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=718352#c10\nso this workaround apparently specific to Chrome is unfortunately necessary.  In this case, debugging the resulting cascading errors that due to the current refactoring allowed it to appear as though enough initialization has occurred for TGS to function is really what cost a lot of time - while the actual resulting fix that you also found needed to be relocated and then was not nearly as time consuming to implement. :). The above errors are the same I have been seeing and reported several commits ago in #823 without any acknowledgement from @deanoemcke as of yet after 9 days and continued activity so I have no idea of status.  Even latest Chrome DEV 73.0.3639.1 running TGS latest commit c07ac99 produces this upon even initialization, and throws it again upon any suspend operation which all fail - so TGS has zero functionality ATM:\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'queueTabAsPromise' of undefined\n    at queueTabForSuspensionAsPromise (gsTabSuspendManager.js:49)\n    at Object.queueTabForSuspension (gsTabSuspendManager.js:35)\n    at activeTab (background.js:427)\n    at background.js:176\n. FYI, I know it's an issue with the refactoring because simply rolling back to beta.128-68 Commit-g4e4d20e (prior to the recent major refactoring) of TGS instantly reverts TGS to a working state (suspend operations) on every version of Chrome I have tested to latest Canary - with the only exception being the session management seems blank but I believe that to be a case of lack of backwards compatibility of rolling back and having updated session data.  Either way, there are no good options right now so I hope Dean is close to a solution.\nEdit:  Have I mentioned how much I loathe Javascript?  30+yrs in the DEV world and I still cannot believe this language lasted past that first year gotta love a language where you have to add a darn '===undefined' check 500 times PER MODULE and undefined can't be caught within null checks like any other language and single undefined frequently takes down an entire app.\nEdit2: As it turns out, this appears to be a cascading initialization error still revolving around the darn favIcon routines which makes sense because of the massive refactoring they have gone through the last couple months.. Have a working fix - creating a PR now for it to hopefully get merged soon.. PR #827 created - all came down to cascading from darn crossorigin favicon which was simply killing the ability to fully init.  Running with my PR now tested in stable/DEV/Canary all ok and I also referenced a few links in the PR including that this very ~~bug~~/issue has been presented to Chromium team numerous times and finally declared WontFix so this workaround apparently specific to Chrome is unfortunately necessary.. Update:  Looks like this is/was the result of 2 issues - one was fixed with your last commits ending in 83287ac.  The other appears to still affect only some systems and revolves around the latest Chrome DEV build (but oddly only appears to affect TGS) (so far as I test).  Although like I said when I opened this it was in-between a few related commits that might have only caused the issue being implemented separately.\nI'll continue testing and return to either report back more or just close this issue out shortly.. If I roll back to prior build or earlier running the latest commit now once again appears stable.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that in a month if this Chromium code makes it to stable and this TGS code remains as-is, it will no longer function.  Certainly not a down-the-road situation you want to become reality.\nThe above cross-origin error is the one by itself that appears upon Chrome attempting to init the extension, and because of (I'm theorizing) that new error being severe enough that TGS isn't running and won't function in any respect.    \nIf you can possibly test with the latest (Version 72.0.3626.7 (Official Build) dev (64-bit)) with your debugging and shed light onto what is happening, I'm certain with good detail that you opening a Chromium issue armed with that (rather than my simple test results and no way to generate any logs) will get it assigned to a Chromium DEV and probably resolved within hours.. @deanoemcke Hi Dean!  I've asked before but I'm now wasting a considerable amount of time attempting to (unsuccessfully) debug this extension without having any info yet on the debug/logging you've added.  I see the debug.html and corresponding JS, but without having to totally reverse engineer this all, can you please just give me a few steps to gather the debugging that it looks like is clearly already written into this extension?  TIA!. @deanoemcke  Quick update, I can confirm that rolling back to an older build (I grabbed beta.128-68 Commit-g4e4d20e) instantly solves this issue which is again critical and prevents TGS from so much as initializing due to the above terminating errors.  Rolling back and restarting Chrome then generates the \"TGS has been updated\" and works and no matter what even today's commit refuses to initialize (same errors as above).  Hopefully you can arm me with some info on how to generate enough debugging here to indicate the issue as it apparently does NOT have anything to do with the Chrome DEV build as I initially suspected since the rollback to beta.128-68 Commit-g4e4d20e works on every DEV build right up to the current 72.0.3626.14.. Here is the error generated now with latest commit on Chrome DEV.  TGS now fails to perform ANY suspend actions simply throwing this error under inspect when I click to suspend a tab:\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'queueTabAsPromise' of undefined\n    at queueTabForSuspensionAsPromise (gsTabSuspendManager.js:49)\n    at Object.queueTabForSuspension (gsTabSuspendManager.js:35)\n    at activeTab (background.js:427)\n    at background.js:176. PR #827 created. That error is a totally different issue that I'll let @deanoemcke address I'm surprised to see new commits and not even a comment on this PR or the several open issues it fixes.  I'm not tagged an official contributor so I could not commit direct or would have so hopefully Dean will at least acknowledge the contribution and tell me if it's okay or what exactly the issue is preventing commit.\nEDIT:  Understand for over 10 days NO commit in master has even fully initialized enough to suspend tabs on at least half the systems I test it on - so I jumped after 10 days to apply a tested fix that gets TGS up and running I've been running my fork with this commit 24/7 since without a single noticeable issue (other than the totally separate more cosmetic errors still needing addressing).  You simply were not seeing these other errors before @Jollfye because TGS was SO broken it wouldn't init far enough to even get to these others. :). I should also add that I just noticed with only a few tabs open (was harder to catch with many tabs open last night testing) that despite having my usual 15min suspend setting, as of this last commit now tabs are also auto suspending the second I switch off of them - so auto suspend appears to be broken both on suspend and un-suspend functions with commit 7ad3174.  In the last 5 min I've watched it happen twice in the same session so I'm very confident in reporting as this is now a different session/machine from last night's testing.\nI'll be happy to help test and/or provide some logging if you indicate how best to capture what TGS is capable of providing in the way of logs.  TIA!. Update:  I've gone through the last couple commits code and it's pretty clear there is just no way those changes could be causing this.  That, combined with a bunch more testing I just did with devtools+TGS actions lead me to believe this is likely yet more darn reverted Chromium code (seems like a real pattern lately) since I just noticed my other test machine just updated their DEV build, which I hadn't noticed DID hit the machines affected by this weird TGS behavior, both in the last 24/48hrs.\nI'll leave it open for now and if you want to close soon you can for the sake of anyone else running into the same issue to save some hair-pulling in thinking it may be TGS.  Clearly it IS affecting TGS, but right now I have no details as to what in the latest Chromium code (73.0.3664.3) is now causing TGS to mis-fire and either suspend or unsuspend at the wrong time - which obviously if carried forward WOULD then be a major issue.  Because it does appear to be sporadic (or I just have not put my finger on the exact pattern) it may take some time to even nail down if/how to reproduce it.  If I can get it reproducible then I'll open yet another issue with the Chromium team to look at.  I also wonder what other extensions this could be impacting that I just have not yet experienced.. Another update, this appears to be tied to these two relatively new flags behavior, their defaults, and the recent refactoring although I still cannot point to the exact Chromium commits:\n```\nautomatic-tab-discarding\nproactive-tab-freeze-and-discard\n```\nMore-so the 2nd, which I believe MAY have changed it's default behavior as this really does appear to be the browser overriding TGS and issuing a \"freeze\" which then trips TGS somehow causing it to instantly suspend well before it's time.  Then, upon simply re-focusing that tab, Chrome's new \"unfreeze\" seems to kick in once again triggering TGS to perform the instant unsuspend, despite the TGS setting for unsuspend upon focus being disabled.  I am continuing to test with all the different variations of this new flag to determine how one can best continue the old behavior of allowing a suspend WITH the new discard (although if you read this quote below from the included Chromium issue link I was very surprised to see the plan is to now move away from the brand new discard in favor of strictly the \"freeze\").  If you are not aware of this apparent planned change it probably is of great interest as it clearly impacts the ability of TGS functionality:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=775644\n```\n9/13/2018:\n\"Note that we will soon stop the discarding experiments and only enable tab freezing, if the current feature is too painful then I'd recommend switching  chrome://flags/#proactive-tab-freeze-and-discard to \"Enabled Freeze only\" (AFAWK there's no negative side effects associated with tab freezing and this has a clear performance impact).\"\n```\nEDIT 01-09-2019_05:24PM:\nNope - even with both the above flags fully set to DISABLED, it almost seems that whatever code changed in Chromium it is actually when TGS applies a SINGLE tab suspend, that IS based on my 15 min setting -- and THEN at that point seems that perhaps THAT is when this new buggy behavior occurs and ALL tabs, not only the one in need - actually suspend some of which were active seconds ago.  I just reproduced it with a dozen tabs and upon the first couple older tabs suspending, now ALL dozen suspended together.  Hopefully that info at least helps again even if it is a Chromium code issue, if we ignore it now it will likely become reality in stable in a month or so and become a huge problem.. Here is how I recreated it just now, running today's commit a687c57.\nFirst, set:\ndebugErrors: true  |  debugInfo: true\nMy settings:\n\n\nOpen debug console\nOpen new tab to http://example.com/\nRe-verify TGS is not set to ignore this site/tab:\n\n\n\nClear console output\nRefresh tab\nTGS debug output after > 2minutes (all OTHER tabs were correctly suspended at 20 seconds with ONLY current tab still unsuspended):\n09:14:07.141 gsUtils.js:41 1 \"09:14:07\" \"window changed\"\n09:14:07.153 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"send message to tab\" {action: \"requestInfo\", tabId: 190}\n09:14:07.160 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"response from tab\" {action: \"reportTabState\", status: \"normal\", scrollPos: 0}\n09:14:07.411 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"unsuspended tab state changed. changeInfo: \" {status: \"loading\"}\n09:14:07.654 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"new tab focus handled\"\n09:14:07.800 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"unsuspended tab state changed. changeInfo: \" {status: \"complete\"}\n09:14:07.800 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"Clearing tab state props.\"\n09:14:07.801 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"send message to tab\" {ignoreForms: true, tempWhitelist: undefined, tabId: 190}\n09:14:07.803 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"send message to tab\" {action: \"requestInfo\", tabId: 190}\n09:14:07.871 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"response from tab\" {action: \"reportTabState\", status: \"normal\", scrollPos: 0}\n09:14:07.872 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:14:07\" \"response from tab\" {action: \"reportTabState\", status: \"normal\", scrollPos: 0}\n09:15:13.770 gsUtils.js:41 1 \"09:15:13\" \"window changed\"\n09:15:13.775 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:15:13\" \"send message to tab\" {action: \"requestInfo\", tabId: 190}\n09:15:13.795 gsUtils.js:41 190 \"09:15:13\" \"response from tab\" {action: \"reportTabState\", status: \"normal\", scrollPos: 0}\nAt this point, everything sits idle with the active tab unchanged/unsuspended.\n\n\nI just re-ran this on FOUR different Win7x64 systems running Chrome 73.0.3679.0.  Again, I do not remember EVER having the active tab suspend properly I just had gotten used to it being a broken feature but since you're indicating it actually does work it would sure be nice to not have Chrome sitting constantly at the active tab churning away if I forget to manually suspend it.  I still think there's something to my debugging above and the way it's coded being a double-negative but I'm having trouble debugging the code that seems to just never fire so your help would be appreciated.\nWhat else can I try/provide?. Do note if I use the above example.com, switch AWAY from the active tab, but quickly switch BACK (but before the 20 sec suspend) and watch the console, the last line is telling of:\ngsUtils.js:41 245 \"09:32:03\" \"checkQueue\" \"Executing executorFn for tab.\"\n09:32:03.306 gsUtils.js:41 245 \"09:32:03\" \"send message to tab\" {action: \"requestInfo\", tabId: 245}\n09:32:03.307 gsUtils.js:41 245 \"09:32:03\" \"response from tab\" {action: \"reportTabState\", status: \"normal\", scrollPos: 0}\n09:32:03.308 gsUtils.js:41 245 \"09:32:03\" \"checkQueue\" \"Queued tab resolved. Result: \" \"normal\"\n09:32:03.308 gsUtils.js:41 checkQueue 09:32:03 total queue size: 0\n09:32:03.308 gsUtils.js:41 245 \"09:32:03\" \"Focused tab status: normal\"\n09:32:03.809 gsUtils.js:41 245 \"09:32:03\" \"new tab focus handled\"\n09:32:17.581 gsUtils.js:41 245 \"09:32:17\" \"Tab not eligible for suspension.\"\nSo why is it not eligible?  On top of the settings dropdown indicating it IS eligible and WILL be (and DOES if I switch away for 20 sec), the debug window even shows for that tab:\n```\nWinId | TabId | Index | Title | Time to suspend | Status\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\n1 | 245 | 0 | Example Domain | 1/30/2019, 9:31:37 AM | normal\nAnd after simply switching away from that same tab for 21 sec (it suspends):\nWinId | TabId | Index | Title | Time to suspend | Status\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\n1 | 248 | 0 | Example Domain | - | discarded\nEDIT: I still believe there is a double-negative that simply NEVER allows ACTIVE tabs to suspend.  Can you tell me what OS, Chrome, and TGS version you are testing on that actually DOES allow the active tab set to example.com suspend in 20 sec while you watch?  Perhaps I will spin up a VM to help in additional debugging.  TIA!. Re-ran again this time with `disableTabChecks: true` and again it says \"not eligible\" for a tab that DOES suspend just fine if switched away from active:\n09:39:44.612 gsUtils.js:41 1 \"09:39:44\" \"window changed\"\n09:39:44.619 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:44\" \"send message to tab\" {action: \"requestInfo\", tabId: 260}\n09:39:44.627 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:44\" \"response from tab\" {action: \"reportTabState\", status: \"normal\", scrollPos: 0}\n09:39:44.799 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:44\" \"unsuspended tab state changed. changeInfo: \" {status: \"loading\"}\n09:39:45.121 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:45\" \"new tab focus handled\"\n09:39:45.223 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:45\" \"unsuspended tab state changed. changeInfo: \" {status: \"complete\"}\n09:39:45.223 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:45\" \"Clearing tab state props.\"\n09:39:45.224 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:45\" \"send message to tab\" {ignoreForms: true, tempWhitelist: undefined, tabId: 260}\n09:39:45.226 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:45\" \"send message to tab\" {action: \"requestInfo\", tabId: 260}\n09:39:45.267 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:45\" \"response from tab\" {action: \"reportTabState\", status: \"normal\", scrollPos: 0}\n09:39:45.268 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:45\" \"response from tab\" {action: \"reportTabState\", status: \"normal\", scrollPos: 0}\n09:39:58.800 gsUtils.js:41 260 \"09:39:58\" \"Tab not eligible for suspension.\"\n``\nIt then never logs anything after this while sitting on the active tab.  Something tells it the active tab is not eligible, but what?. Note when I reverse the option to \"Never suspend active tab in each window\", I would also expect SOMETHING different in the log - yet the exact same single line occurs ofTab not eligible for suspension` further strengthening my suspicion that due to negated checks, it is just impossible to ever get the proper boolean value (AKA if 0==1 vs when 1==0) required for active tab suspension to fire.\nEDIT: I'll try to edit the code myself to log it - but it would be nice when it's logged that a tab is \"not eligible\", that is also logs the state/reason as to why it is failing the eligibility test.. OMG the above info/comments were all for issue #762 so I'm sure you are VERY confused, LOL!  Please apply all the above to that issue (I will also comment there) - so sorry!  As for this issue, I have already seen this issue come and go with the last few builds of DEV branch, so perhaps keep it open and I will absolutely get back to this issue to re-confirm here on the next build update which I'm sure will hit in the next week.. Does this then resolve my issue I've had open forever asking why the active (reading) tab won't suspend?  https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/762\nEDIT: I swore I saw a commit this AM on this one was it reverted or did I mis-read?.

    "danilaml": "Recently I've also started to experience this issue, however I'm on the latest stable version so I cannot confirm whether it was fixed in master or now. Perhaps an update is an order.. So the GS won't update automatically when 7.0 comes, so that you can unsuspend all tabs before forcing an update? Did I understand correctly? Also, will the old \"suspended\" links work? I.e. if I have them stored in some session management extension, will they open and work correctly after the update?. I'm using \"Session Buddy\" and it works like a charm. It's what's saved all my lost tabs when this extension has decided to spontaneously update (it automatically records last N sessions).. ",

    "Pascal666": "6.30 is now available from the Chrome Web Store and the feature you requested appears to be working perfectly.. 6.30 is now available from the Chrome Web Store and the feature you requested appears to be working perfectly.. Yes, the Screen capture setting is enabled.  The displayed images do not have a scrollbar so it did not occur to me they may continue off the bottom of the screen, but sure enough, if I zoom out on the text header it pulls more image onto the screen.  However, if I right click on the image and select \"Open image in new tab\" I can see that the image is only the size of the screen, including the area normally used by the text header.  If it is converting the entire page to an image, it appears to be discarding most of it.. v6.21 on an Intel Core i7 M 640 (2.8Ghz).  Definitely not top of the line, but I wouldn't call it slow.  I find that the compare feature at http://cpuboss.com/cpu/Intel-Core-i7-640M works really well, if you want to see how they compare.\nI just monitored it closely and that tab went from using about 80MB of ram to 1.8GB and took about 8 minutes to suspend.. Fully patched Windows 7, Chrome 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit), 8GB RAM.  I do not have \"Use high quality screen captures\" turned on.  Before the above test, I made sure the cpu was idle and I had over 2.5GB of free RAM so it would not need to swap to the SSD.  Suspending that tab only pegs one of the cores, so whatever it is doing looks like it is single threaded.  I had 74 Chrome windows and 438 tabs open, but I did a suspend all tabs first so there were only maybe 5 actually not suspended (view-source tabs won't suspend).\nIf I disable all extensions other than The Great Suspender, reboot, open just that one tab, and then suspend it, it grows from 30MB to 400MB (as indicated by Chrome's Task Manager) and takes 4:15.  I enabled a few other extensions and had no change until I enabled uBlock Origin, which made it go over 1.5GB and take 4:30.  When I tested with subsets of other extensions (without uBlock Origin) it went over 2GB and 5 minutes.  So some extensions seem to make the problem even worse while others have no effect.\nI was unable to recreate the problem on other Windows or Linux machines, including an older laptop.  The worst I saw on other machines was about 20 seconds, even with the same Windows, Chrome and TGS versions and identical TGS and Chrome settings (synched via Google).\nI am at a loss as to why it is just my primary laptop experiencing the problem.  I do not have a second Dell Latitude E6510 to test with.\nTGS v6.30 appears to have the same performance as above; visable only or full screen makes no difference.. I finally figured out how to reproduce this problem on other Windows and Linux boxes.  Change the zoom level.  At 100% zoom, the page takes 15 to 20 seconds to suspend.  At 90% or 110% (only values I tested, but probably anything other than 100%) it takes over 4 minutes on every box I tested.\nctrl-+ zooms in\nctrl-- zooms out\nctrl-0 sets zoom to 100%\nctrl with the mouse scroll wheel zooms in or out depending upon direction\nThe Chrome menu also has +/- for zooming in/out.\nAlthough it takes longer when you change the zoom level, really 15-20 seconds is even a lot longer than it should take.  Instead of trying to figure out why the current screenshot code doesn't like different zoom levels, it may be a better use of time to replace the screenshot code altogether.  There are a number of Chrome extensions that take screenshots.  Perhaps one of them has a compatible open source license the code could be copied from.. I've now tested a number of webpages of different sizes from different sites.  Once you know what you are looking for, it is obvious when suspending any webpage beyond just a couple pages that they take longer with other than default zoom.\nThe current image capture library appears to be completely useless with some websites, such as https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15722112 .  The entire top page on many of their stories is an image from a CDN which does not show up at all in the capture.  I don't know if this cross-site issue would exist with any javascript solution though.\n@liamjohnston Thank you.  I'm sure other people use zoom and thus are running into this bug, but I'd imagine in most cases pages are suspended in the background and are small enough people would never notice.  For most pages it will only make a real difference in aggregate, and it will really affect people who have their default page zoom set to something other than 100%.  I tested with all other extensions disabled and still saw the problem, just not as severe (400 MB and 4 minutes instead of 2GB and 8 minutes).\n@deanoemcke That makes sense.  Perhaps this list of a few libraries that appear to implement similar functionality will help:\nhttps://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image\nhttps://pbakaus.github.io/domvas/\nhttps://cburgmer.github.io/rasterizeHTML.js/\nhttps://github.com/ariya/phantomjs\nThank you.\n. Thank you.  Is it possible for you to release a signed version on GitHub that we can manually install without losing all our settings and saved sessions?. 6.30 is now available from the Chrome Web Store.. The real problem here is that GitHub does not make it easy to find important comments.  There are 193 comments on this thread.  Most people won't spend the time to read through them all.  Please email GitHub to complain about this problem, preferably with a suggestion on how to solve it.\nAs a workaround, perhaps OP could edit their post to add a paragraph, right at the top of this thread, listing ways to mitigate the problem and why the fix hasn't been pushed out yet, or maybe the author could add that right at the bottom of the thread and then use the GitHub option to limit the conversation to collaborators.. Chrome stores a list of open tabs in case it crashes.  I wonder if an extension can access this list, and how often Chrome updates it.  Maybe TGS could read it in right after the update and reopen any TGS tabs listed.  We may get a couple extra tabs the user already closed, but that is certainly better than losing them all.. This Chrome bug has affected a number of plugins.  Clicking repair in chrome://extensions/ will delete all of the extension's data (saved sessions, settings, etc.).  Unfortunately, that is the only option given there.\nWork-around is to visit the extension in the Chrome store.  There will be a note at the top of the screen saying \"This item has been disabled in Chrome. Enable this item\".  Click on Enable and the extension will work again with no data loss.\nIt would be nice if TGS synchronized data via the chrome.storage API or similar, so the loss of local data was not irrevocable.. I wonder if you could partner with some extension designed for session management and syncing?  Make their extension TGS aware, so users that do want syncing can just install it and it will take care of removing the chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg... part if a user asks it to open a tab on a device that does not have TGS installed and optionally add it for devices that do.\nLet users know during install that for maximum safety and/or syncing they should install the other extension, and they could advertise their extension as TGS aware so more people learn about TGS.\nIt would be nice to have the other extension be able to import old TGS sessions too.  There are a few problems with the current TGS export option:\nYou have to export sessions one at a time.\nIt doesn't delineate windows so you end up with hundreds or thousands of tabs in one window.\nIt strips off the chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg... part so all tabs take ram immediately, overwhelming most boxes (I usually add this back to the export using Notepad search & replace.)\nThank you again for all your hard work on this extension.. I see the same behavior on v6.30 on Chrome.  The new entry only shows up under the 'Saved sessions' section after you reload the Session management tab or leave it and come back.. No errors on the console.  Yes, the popup shows, and the session gets saved successfully, it just doesn't show up in the saved list until after the page is reloaded.. Thank you.  Perhaps my sessions are larger than yours and thus take longer to save?  My current session is 220 windows, 795 tabs.. I work on multiple projects and group related windows together.  In addition to the Chrome windows, I have an about equal number of other program windows, mainly PuTTY, Notepad, Excel, and DOS Prompt.  I have multiple taskbars I scroll up and down through.  I use 7+ Taskbar Tweaker to allow me to drag n drop windows around on the taskbars to group them appropriately.  Each project uses a different number of each application, so I can often scroll through taskbars until I see the right one (three PuTTY windows in a row, or two DOS Prompts separated by two Chrome windows, etc).  I also use the Chrome extension Quick Tabs so I can quickly flip to recent tabs and search tabs by title text.  I reboot about once a month, usually shortly after patch Tuesday, because it takes me a while to get all my programs running again and grouped correctly.. This feature strikes me as out of scope for this plugin.  You would still need a way to find a particular tab even if it were not suspended.\nI use Quick Tabs to get a list of all my tabs sorted by most recently used and it does text searches of titles and urls.  You will probably want to disable fuzzy search: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-tabs/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb?hl=en. I am seeing the same thing.  When a tab is unsuspended I always get returned to the top of the page on v6.30.  I tested both with and without screen capturing.. In my experience, tab discarding does not save nearly as much memory as TGS.  Could be plugin related.. I get the impression that a lot of memory used by Chrome is not actually accounted for by Chrome.  Perhaps it is in resources like handles, GDI and user objects, etc.\nWindows Task Manager's Performance tab lists total commit.

I type in my zip code, hit enter, then try to manually suspend the tab, and nothing happens.  I've tested with TGS v6.30 on both Linux and Windows.\n\"Do not suspend tabs that contain unsaved form inputs\" only shows up as an option after I enable auto-suspend.  I had auto-suspend disabled, but just enabled it and unchecked all the \"Do not suspend\" options and that tab will not auto-suspend either.  Clicking on TGS says \"Tab will be suspended automatically.\", but it doesn't.\nIf Screen capturing is disabled, the tab suspends normally.. I just tested again on both Windows and Linux, and now that one works perfectly.  This one works on Linux, but not Windows: http://www.instructables.com/id/Hack-Make-Your-Digital-Picture-Frame-Go-Live/\nThe developer console output appears to be very useful.  Right after I tell it to suspend it gets a 404 and then \"Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'toDataURL' on 'HTMLCanvasElement': Tainted canvases may not be exported\".  I switched from full page to visable only, tried in a few different spots on the page, and got the same output.

I've just installed The Great Discarder and it looks so much better right now! Thanks a lot!\nBtw, I've met The Great Suspender extension because of this article from Google you've sent haha, and now I'm meeting The Great Discarder because you talked about it and mentioned the same article!\n@volt55 I suggest you to read the article he linked. It answers almost all questions you have. I don't know if it can handle 1000+ tabs, but maybe it can! It looks so much better!\nEdit: I almost forgot. I also suggest you the extension OneTab. I use it always and I really love it. It can save your life as it saved mine. (Or destroy it, since I have now 1500+ tabs saved and I'm not willing to get rit of them haha I'm actually right now literally trying to save an HD just to get 900+ saved tabs back. It is literally the only piece of data that I don't have a recent backup and I need back from it). @volt55 I'm not sure why you need 1000+ tabs open if you already use OneTab. But whatever, if The Great Discarder can't solve your problem you could try the new version of Firefox. They said they can do something like that now. Or you can try forks of Chromium that are lighter. Just some suggestions. But I'm actually convinced TGD may solve your problem.

So the user can be warn and maybe prepare before hand in case such thing happened.. @RJVB thank you, that's what I meant.\n@deanoemcke I suspect the reason those tabs are lost is that there's 2 new permission which chrome needs to request user to accept. If a \"warning message\" is pushed one version before like what @RJVB describe, without those new permission, then it should not have cause the tabs to be lost.\nI don't meant to sound ungrateful, I'm actually grateful and happy with the extension thus far.

So thank you very much for your work! ;). Dear deanoemcke, sorry that once again I write here, but I just came up an interesting idea and I would like you as a developer to ask - is it possible to do some special option (user selectable) when choosing which extension will not ask such terrible permissions (READ and CHANGE ALL data)? Let maybe some extra features will not be available in this case (for example screen shot, etc.). I think then to all these questions, fears and suspicions of many users would simply fall away by themselves!\n\u00a0 This is possible in principle to do ???. ",

I look at the extension, see it disabled with a \"this contains a serious vulnerability\" message.\nTook for granted how much I relied on this extension, just as I did the Firefox ones (700 open tabs over there).\nGotta love Google's walled garden with forced automatic updating of extensions and no way for the user to disable it without directly editing the extension's files.  Shame Mozilla went AWOL with Firefox's design and forced me to change.. never liked how Google handles things, never will.. I don't understand how people lost their tabs.\nAfter it disabled itself, I re-enabled it and loaded my old session history from the extension options.  There were like 6 backups + the current session.  I even saved the session file just in case, but never ended up needing it.\nIf you fully lost your session, then I'm gonna have to say you did something weird, or I'm a lucky use-case.  I have no idea.\n@bhuvidya  That issue is 2 years old.  Auto-updating was either added since then or Chrome itself took over that function with its forced addon updating.. I noticed this after upgrading to 6.30 too.\nBit annoying.  I only have select things in that menu, and this is not something I want there.. So it is caused by this extension, huh..\n2nd time it's happened to me; hoping that update's out soon.. with a way to preserve our data!\nEdit: Clearing cookies is alright, but we lose things stored in them, which for youtube I think contains our watched/resume history.  For someone like me, that's really important, so if the cookies do contain the data, we're forced to manually delete the problematic sections of the cookies rather than wipe them entirely.. Just happened to me yet again this morning and I was forced to do a manual clearing of all the gsScrollPos cookies again, of which there were around 40 different ones.\nIt's effectively happening to me about once a month.\nUpon looking at my cookies with that extension mentioned above, I see there's numerous \"gsScrollPos\" entries for various sites which I don't have suspended, and even haven't visited in weeks.  Are they all from the addon? I'll probably just delete all of them.  Why they haven't been deleted upon session end, as they state, is beyond me.\nI think it's time I switch to the dev version with this fix, especially seeing as it's been untouched for a month now.\nAs per my original comment edit:  Clearing cookies is alright, but we lose things stored in them (ie; login session), which for youtube I think contains our visited/watched/resume history (can someone confirm?). For people like me, that's really important, so if the cookies do contain the data, we're forced to manually delete the problematic sections of the cookies rather than wipe them entirely.. I don't recall ever seeing invisible text on a website thus far, just this version of the addon.\nDo you have an example website that uses the same font display that I could test with?. Sorry about not responding to this.\nAfter dealing with trying to switch to the unpacked version to fix the gScrollPos issue and Chrome being god awful, nagging about how it was running an unpacked extension, then trying to pack it and actually get chrome to load it.. having to go through whitelisting in some group policy setting for it, almost losing my tabs because of the ID changing when packing.. ugh, ugh.\nIt just made me not want to change versions again.\nI can look into it again with an updated version now I guess, just have to find the time for it... Okay, finally got around to this.. ironically as I was setting up a conversion to Cent to finally get off my old Chrome version into a Chrome based browser that actually cares about its users. (ie; still has GDI rendering so text isn't a blurry eye straining mess, plus numerous advanced options).\nYes, the invisible text is on every page the extension creates.  The drop down menu, the welcome screen, the options screen, the suspended tab screen.. (though I'm not sure how to suspend a tab, the ctrl+shift+s hotkey isn't working, maybe I rebound the default and forgot)\nThe console outputs this on the welcome page:\nwelcome.js:7 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'documentReadyAndLocalisedAsPromsied' of undefined\nWhen I try to view the options, I get this:\noptions.js:155 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'documentReadyAndLocalisedAsPromsied' of undefined(anonymous function) @ options.js:155(anonymous function) @ options.js:193\nScreenshot of some console stuff: \n\nI don't reeeeally know what I'm doing here (despite being an IT person, I've never gotten into coding and it super intimidates me), but I'd assume that error confirms your suspicion of it being a localization or \"I18N\" problem.\nHopefully I can get my Cent switch done soon so you (and other web/app devs) don't have to worry about the rare person like me running an old Chrome version (which should forcefully auto-update normally..).. OS:  Windows 10 x64 v1703 build 15063.726\nChrome:  51.0.2704.106  x64\nRunning that command gives me a list of things far too long to paste here.  I can right click and save the log, but it only appears to save what's actually displayed on screen; doesn't include everything in the collapsed menus.  It also saves it as a mass of text instead of being formatted as shown in the console.\nShort example: Mass of text\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'documentReadyAndLocalisedAsPromsied' of

fixes itself after a browser restart, but toggling it results in this behavior when I click on the menu.. No problem, got my Cent switch done a while ago so now I'm relatively up to date with Chrome updates and sites/extensions aren't broken anymore.\nJust have to hope the developer doesn't give up on it or put in some drastic change caused by a major Chrome overhaul that Google does..\nWhy companies can't leave well enough alone is beyond me.  First Firefox, then Chrome.. ugh.. A dark grey or mid-black is a good go-to color for dark themes.\nSome people like pure or dark black, but I think it being too dark conflicts with contrast between page elements (and monitor bezels).\nWhatever it is in 7.3.0 that I have installed is nice.. @deanoemcke I got the link in an older issue about the gscrollpos thing: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537#issuecomment-334925747\nNever changed because of Chrome being horrid about extensions with its forced whitelist, didn't want to go through the whole ordeal again..

    "sammarcus": "Google marking this as having a vulnerability definitely happened within the last 10 minutes. The developer said he was in contact with Google after he found out his account was compromised. I suppose this is Google's solution, for the time being. \nIt's really weird someone would update this, request additional permissions but only bump the version? Why wouldn't they do more than that if they had negative intent to compromise the account in the first place?. @shanempope I haven't examined the code from the recent Web Store version, I was only going off of @deanoemcke comment from above.\n@liamjohnston I feel confident in saying 98%+ of the people using this extension are using the version from the Chrome Web Store \ud83d\ude04 . \n. @lgpmichael2 this is a fair point. adding as an additional anecdote, the great suspender twitter account (the one that tweeted today that it was safe) was just yesterday confused about someone saying the extension had been updated. I'm not sure how he can prove it's really him tweeting and writing in this thread, but I'm inclined to believe it is actually him since if it was the attacker tweeting, they wouldn't have denied there was an update.\nHe did also just link to this very thread just now, so if it wasn't him, I don't think he'd want to draw additional attention to it :)\n@deanoemcke thanks for being responsive to this \ud83d\ude4f . @mkrier multiple times in this thread it very clearly states \u2014 through several independent people reviewing the diffs \u2014 that your personal information was not compromised since there was no malicious code in version 6.22.\n@deanoemcke thanks for handling this unfortunate situation so well \ud83c\udf89 . @Master-1- \n\nsomeone tried to login and reset my password on one of my accounts. I suspect it was because of this hack. \n\nChrome extensions are sandboxed to the extent that any damage would have had to come from the code we've inspected.  It's been reviewed line by line and there wasn't anything malicious. So it would have had to have been something else.. @deanoemcke was curious if you ever did a write up about this now that it's all over. would be interested in hearing your insights and experience!. \n.

It is more than possible that someone else has ALSO compromised his github account, and is telling everyone to \"yeah go ahead and reenable it\"...\nIs there someone else familiar with the code who can verify that the code change was as simple and unobtrusive as claimed?\n(Sorry @deanoemcke absolutely nothing against you, simply security best practice! When one thing is compromised, we can't trust anything linked to it). @liamjohnston Thanks for the corroboration, and my sincere apologies to @deanoemcke - I just felt we needed to be 100% sure.. ",

Hey @deanoemcke thanks for getting v6.30 out there - I knew I loved this extension a lot, but I didn't realise just how much til it all went buggery-boo.

I don't care about the tabs, that's trivial.  Could the hacked version get my passwords or not?  Btw, chrome never disabled it automatically.  . Ok I read most of it- and right now I just searched the page and only found three comments that mentioned  \"password\" or \"personal\", one of which is what you just posted.  And only yours provides that confirmation explicitly.\nBtw this extension is awesome, I donated $5 a while back and told a friend of mine to try it and do the same.  This is so great, thanks.. Want to reiterated the recommendation for Session Buddy, but also- most people don't know this-  If you quit chrome form the taskbar (in windows at least) by right clicking on it, then you only get the top window restored.  Whereas, if you quit it within chrome itself from the settings menu, you get all of them back.  (I mean, as a general thing- not a specific issue with Suspender, I'm just saying as a general thing about chrome.)\nI don't know if that's true in Ubuntu because I figured that out back when I was running windows before I made the switch.  (And I'm not going to test that here lol)\n. @deanoemcke \nWell, yesterday when the update happened, my session history had an august 25th, I think it was 8something AM.  But that was yesterday and so it's not there now.  Here's what I have now:\nCurrent session:\n26 Aug 2018 9:44pm  (11 windows, 162 tabs)\nRecent sessions:\n12 Aug 2018 3:07am  (9 windows, 227 tabs)\n30 Jul 2018 2:30pm  (10 windows, 176 tabs)\nSaved sessions:\nAutomatic save point for v6.30  (9 windows, 227 tabs)\nWhen I'm warned before updates now, will I be able to refuse? \nYou say the decision weighed heavily on your mind?  I totally know- I'm a developer too, for 20 years.  I know where you're coming from.  \nSomething worth mentioning for others:\nIn the past some of us have recommended Session Buddy.  Well, apparently, a year ago, Session Buddy (quietly) changed the frequency of it's updates:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sessionbuddy-discuss/QUb4zqWz5CI\nI had installed Session Buddy as a failsafe in case Suspender messed up (such as now). I didn't know that it had somehow been (idiotically) changed by the author (Of session buddy; not you).  (You can see why I generally hate \"automatic updates\" in software in general.  Not just extensions, I mean ANYTHING.) \nSoooo, first of all you might want to tell your users that, because we had all been mentioning session buddy here on github, right. \nSo, in light of this recent little disaster, I did a some searching and experimenting with different extensions and now I'm using this:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-backup-restore/dehocbglhkaogiljpihicakmlockmlgd\nSo far good.  Try it... Seems better, right?  I haven't tried doing a restore yet, to see if it actually opens the windows and tabs, but, hell, even if that doesn't work and it's just keeping the urls where I can see them, hell, I'll take that, at least something that'd go a long way.  \nShould I post that as an op post?  Might be worth it.  (Of if you post it yourself, give props to me :) )\n. @deanoemcke \nSure, sounds good (measured response, btw).  So, I'll start a new post right now and basically just paste what I said here more or less.\n. Yea, my case is pretty much exactly the same as @mopquill .   Some tabs were still open (presumably the un-suspneded tabs), and the rest were gone, and then when I used Suspender's restore, it brought back way old tabs from like weeks ago.   \nAnd, yea, as I said here and in my other thread- Session buddy let me down as other users agreed about.\nJust wanna add one thing- I know what you mean by killing the process and then chrome lets you restore when you start it back up, but-\nA similar thing you can do is manually shut chrome down.  What I mean by that- it's counter-intuitive and undocumented but, ok here-\nYou know how in Windows 10 you can right-click on your task bar and go \"Close all windows\"?  \nYea, don't do that.  Use the settings menu in chrome and choose \"Exit\".\nWhen you do it that way, you get your tabs/windows back.  Again- it's counter-intuitive and undocumented. Pro-tip.\n(But that wouldn't help in this Suspender disaster.) \n. Oh I see.  Ok what's better then?  In the void left of Session Buddy? . You're in the minority there. As I said in the op post- session buddy quietly stretched out the gap for it's automatic saves.  hell, does it even do automatic saves at all anymore?  \nI was NOT able to recover my tabs with session buddy.  @deanoemcke  can maybe chime in about it from the other post thread.\nAnd no, it's infeasible for me to  switch to firefox.\n. @RobertAb1  \nmmm well it's hard to take an average.  The mean wouldn't be a good measure, but the median would be like... call it about two weeks... . @RobertAb1 \nWell, we philosophically disagree about backups.  I believe that backups should never be manual.  Humans are usually the point of failure.  I shouldn't have to think about backups at all, except-in-so-much as to check that they're actually still working.  (see- even there, that was the point of failure; the human.)\nI'm much happier with Tabs Backup & Restore even if it's not supported.  \n(Well: edit: I guess a backup should be manual if you're going to like, reinstall the OS or do a migration, etc.  A point of deliberate change/movement.)\n. @RobertAb1  \nOk I respect that, but manually restarting it to cause a backup, is still.... manual.  \nAnd while Session Buddy never gave you, in particular, problems, well- it gave a lot of other people problems who didn't waste their human labor doing things manually.  (as you'll see in the link I provided in the op post- people who got screwed over by the quiet update last winter).\nAnd, again, switching to firefox (waterfox), isn't an option for me- I rely on other extensions here.  (One in particular)\nBut anyway, I think we've got our different situations resolved, right. \nIf so, cheers,\nm \n. @RobertAb1  oohhh I thought you were restarting it specifically to make session buddy backup. I see now, thanks. . ",

ALSO just tested on chrome webstore version (figuring out how to update to the github build is a tomorrow task...) - suspend other tabs seems to stomp on the \"don't suspend audio tabs\" setting if I have it enabled (as a workaround to see if I can limit autoplay-hunting by suspending tabs that haven't started to autoplay but might; also helps keep good audio active).  Unless the way it respects \"don't suspend audio tabs\" is with a \"do you want to navigate away from this site\" message allowing you to stop the suspension.... \n",
    "uecasm": "The main thing I disliked about these auto updates (other than the security scare, which you've already addressed) is that they happened without restarting the browser at all -- just boom 1000+ tabs suddenly vanished (and this happened three times today alone).  They weren't in the Suspender's session tracking either (at least not the first time -- most of them were in there by the second and third times), but fortunately I also have Session Buddy which managed to get back all but a few very recent ones.\nIf updates are going to destroy tabs, is there some way to disable updates while the browser is open?  For that matter, why is this trying to bundle session management when there are already other extensions for that?\n(I don't mind as much the possibility of losing tabs across browser restarts, because at least they have robust saved sessions per startup.  But tab tracking during a single session can be more dicey, because you're at the mercy of whether it chooses to overwrite the session with the missing-tabs version before you notice that you've lost tabs.). If it's possible to disable the silent-update-while-running behaviour (maybe via an option), that would be nice.  Or was today just a once-off, and automatic updates are disabled again?\nRegardless, maybe the \"the extension has just been updated and killed all your tabs\" page should have a link to the tab restoring page, with specific advice as to which thing to click on (presumably the \"resuspend\" link in one of the recent histories).  Or it should just do that automatically as well, although that might still be annoying, since at least today it's never been completely correct (maybe that will be better in future with \"normal\" updates though).\nIt still ends up reordering tabs and opening new windows, so it probably shouldn't be automatic.  But better-guided would be nice, if it's unavoidable.\nGiven that you have page-content-rewriting permissions anyway, would it be possible to discard the page content on suspend without actually rewriting the URL?  That way the tabs shouldn't disappear with the extension.  Perhaps this wouldn't release as much memory, though, and means session managers would save the unsuspended URLs if they're not taking full content snapshots.  So it's not perfect, but might be better.. @Master-1- \n\nThanks for the updates but I have to take into account that there might have been a malicious activity because yesterday around 12:45 someone tried to login and reset my password on one of my accounts. I suspect it was because of this hack. Not 100% sure though. Just letting you know.\n\nNote that this can also happen if one of your suspended tabs happened to be a password reset page, and during the course of things it was reloaded unsuspended at some point.  (This shouldn't be the case since password resets should use a nonce so they're invalid if the page is reloaded, but many websites don't do that, so this can indeed happen.). What about https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#event-onUpdateAvailable?  It sounds like that would let you detect an impending update.. ",

There's still a Great Suspender item in the context menu. And it works, which is confusing since the extension is theoretically removed. Thoughts?. Thanks for the quick response, @deanoemcke. No, TGS has disappeared from my list of installed extensions. That's why it seems so funky that it still shows in the context menu, and is functional.. @liamjohnston yep, that's what I'm looking at. Interestingly, I've realized/rememberd that I can get to the settings for TGS by clicking on the link in the lower right corner of any suspended tab. So, basically, the extension seems to be installed in a kind of \"stealth\" mode.\n@deanoemcke I forgot to specify that this is on a Mac running High Sierra. I'm using Chrome version 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit). And TGS itself is v7.0.131..

Does anybody know of a better extension paid or free that can let me easily have over 500 tabs without making the chrome browser become unresponsive? . @johanbrunius Do you know any tab extension that will easily let me have over 500 tabs open, with most of them being hibernated of course and not make my Chrome browser unresponsive? \nI am using the great suspender and Chrome became completely unresponsive with only 220 tabs, most of them suspended.. @johanbrunius How did you become aware of this extension? Did someone tell you? Does it receive good feedback and reviews? . @johanbrunius I'm back to report about the browser extension you linked, titled \"Tab Hibernate\"  by developer dcohenb. The extension just does not work as apparently intended. The \"auto hibernate\" feature does not work at all as far as I can see. The \"display screenshot in hibernating tabs\" option also does not work most of the time, it only works for some tabs, which is rare. The \"disable\" features for hibernating current pages and websites just does not work at all, or at best only sometimes works. The only options or features that will work 100% of the time are the main options to \"Hibernate this Tab\" (the current tab), \"Hibernate All Tabs\" and \"Wakeup All\" Tabs. Unless I am just using this extension wrong, which I don't think I am, this extension is just shoddy for most of it's features. But once again, if a potential user just wants to hibernate all tabs with the click of a button, or hibernate their current tab, or wakeup all tabs, with the click of a button then this will be a sufficient extension for those simple features. It's just the auto-hibernate feature does not work at all, so keep that in mind. . @johanbrunius \nI also want to add 3 important things: \n\n\nThat when \"Tab Hibernate\" hibernates tabs and then is disabled in the Google Chrome Browsers any tabs that are still hibernating are closed.  \n\n\nIt actually can not be used in incognito mode. It does not work in incognito mode. The tabs do not hibernate correctly and can't be hibernated.\n\n\nSome websites or pages just can not \"hibernate\" correctly and hence don't hibernate, in both normal browsing or incognito mode. \n\n\nI give the extension a solid 2/10. It's just not good and doesn't work correctly. . Does anybody know if the Chrome extension \"The Great Discarder\" is good? If it is good, what are some drawbacks about the extension?. @liamjohnston I was already aware that they are by the same developer. \nMy main confusion between the two is \"discarding a tab\" for The Great Discarder as apposed to \"suspending a tab\" for The Great Suspender. What is the difference between \"discarding\" and \"suspending\"? \nDoes \"discarding\" , for instance, quit a tab? \nI just don't know the difference. \nAlso I need to be able to have more than 200-500 tabs open without taking up a lot of memory or making my browser become unresponsive, by using a tab hibernating extension enabled of course. I actually would like to have 1000+ tabs open. Is the updated version of TGS going to be able to handle 1000+ tabs open with 95-99% of them being suspended or hibernated?\nI need to have hundreds of tabs open, but inactively suspended, without crashing or making my browser unresponsive. Will TGS be able to accomplish this? Because right now it is not handling more than 250+ tabs, most of them being suspended. My browser still becomes completely unresponsive even with the TGS extension enabled and I have to do a Force Quit on my browser, Chrome in this case. \nSo will TGS be able to handle 1000+ tabs?\nAlso is it even worth installing TGD? What are the worthwhile advantages to using TGD rather than TGS? (If you don't mind stating them)\n. @jvschiavo Thanks. I was actually right in the middle of reading the link when you sent your comment. Also, I already have OneTab. \nI assume that maybe software will not be able to resolve my concern and that I will need to upgrade my hardware, such as getting more RAM for instance. I assume software can only do so much and might not let me get up to 1000+ tabs without upgrading my hardware. . @jvschiavo Sorry, I meant to say I have OneTab, but I don't really use it. I have only used it a few times. I easily get carried away and get into 1000+ tabs, but I usually go through each tab and close out tabs when I am done looking at them or using them. But, like I said I get into 1000+ tabs or rather I use to get to 1000+ tabs, but my computer could not handle it, so I had to stop using so many tabs. I have forced myself to only use around 200 tabs open at most even with TGS enabled. I would like to be able to use much more, 1000+ tabs for instance. . @jvschiavo Why do you think I should use The Great Discarder? . @edsilmon I can, and I will, and I'm about to, but I was just asking if the new updated version will be able to handle more tabs. Does the updated version handle more tabs than the current version? . @jvschiavo What are all the versions of Chromium and where can I download them? . @edsilmon I just would like a definitive answer to my question where I asked if the updated or future update to TGS will be able to handle more tabs, more than it can now, because if it will, I just want to make sure the zip file has the feature included or if it is possible for it to be in any future update to TGS. Because right now, I can barely push out 250 tabs with TGS enabled. \nI don't really mind the error 400 (I can just delete cookies). It's the ability and feature to have more tabs open, that I really care about. \nI'm just trying everything that I can software-wise because I can't afford more RAM or hardware at this time. My browser keeps becoming unresponsive and I have to force quit it because of this problem. . @edsilmon Also, if the zip file does not have the ability to have more tabs open and a future update does, then I would like to know that so I can wait for that update. Like I said, the error 400 is just not a big deal for me anymore. I can easily just delete cookies. If a future update has the feature to have more tabs then I'll just wait for it. I might just install the zip file anyway. It's just not a big deal one way or another just for fixing error 400.. @roastchicken My computer has 16 GB. I guess 16 GB is a lot, but my computer or just the Browser applications itself, such as Chrome, continues to become unresponsive and I have to force quit it if I go over 200+ tabs. So apparently it isn't enough. \nYes, I agree with you on making a conscious effort to limit the amount of open tabs, but as I have said I get carried away. And believe it or not I sometimes and quite frequently look at way more than 50 tabs sometimes upward to 150+ (use to be much more; 300-500 easily) tabs interchangeably and constantly and need to have many tabs open. But, like you may have implied I guess limiting my tabs really is the only way to operate my computer without my browser or computer becoming unresponsive or crashing. . @roastchicken Do you know what advantages The Great Discarder has over TGS?\nAlso do you know where I can download all the different versions of Chromium  like @jvschiavo mentioned?. @liamjohnston So basically TGD stores less memory when tabs are 'discarded' than TGS, yet somehow loads tabs quicker when clicked on to view than TGS?\n  . @liamjohnston Ok, sorry I guess I am just misunderstanding. It's kind of confusing me. The difference between TGS and TGD I mean. . @liamjohnston Sorry for prolonging this conversation, but is TGD more effective in any way than TGS and how? Again, this is a tad confusing for me, sorry for asking a lot of questions or repeating myself, I just don't quite understand. . @liamjohnston Ok thanks. Got it.. @liamjohnston I don't know if this is fairly obvious, but can I enable TGS and TGD at the same time? Will they interfere with each other or cause a problem if they are both turned on and enabled? . I know this might be a little off topic, but does anybody know where I can get questions answered about SessionBuddy? . @audi4444player Thanks for your input. I actually suspend at least 90% of all my tabs that are open, maybe even more like 95-97%. And I usually open around 100-200 currently. I use to be able to do more without even using TGS, such as 500-700 tabs, but my computer and browser application (Chrome) eventually started to crash and become unresponsive more and more as time went on. I would and still have to force quit out of my browser and even force shut down or restart my computer. My computer is only about 3 years old. I usually also have only around 4 or 5 windows at most open at any given time. \nThe thing is, the problem for me might actually be that I have multiple browsers open. But, I need someone else to confirm this. At least two of the browsers usually have around 100-200 tabs open, they are typically Chrome Browsers. Not to mention I have around 4-7 different non-browser applications open such as a notepad app, photos app, settings app, and music app open most of the time. I usually have 3 or even 4 different browsers open. I have the regular version of Chrome, Chrome Canary, Firefox, and a few others. The Chrome Browsers are where I usually open the most tabs over 50-200. I really don't think that is too taxing on my system or computer is it? I don't know too much about computers, but I have a Intel core i5 processor. Is the i5 processor a part of this problem? . @deanoemcke @liamjohnston What features does the zip file and future update have besides not storing gsScrollPos cookies? \n. @edsilmon To be honest, I like forums, but my dislike of using them outweighs the positives because most of them are incredibly tedious to find the answer I am looking for and I don't even know where to look because there is just too many threads at most forums and it takes up way too much time to look through and find the right threads. \nI guess that really is the only way resolve my issues. I can't upgrade my hardware at this time. And I would prefer to avoid go to a PC expert to look at my pc until I back up everything on my computer, which isn't anytime soon. So, I'll might try to look at forums or just use google search for more info to hopefully remedy the issue.  \n. @edsilmon Yes, I do use the search function on most forums, but there is still many results that come back and most of the time even with specific keywords none of the result say explicitly the question I am asking or give the answer I am looking for in the title or even have similar phrases, so I usually have to go into tens and sometimes hundreds or even thousands of threads, each with dozens or even hundreds of posts, just to be looking and reading threads that usually have nothing to do with my original question, even if I am just skimming them over. I don't have the time or patience to do that. Sometimes it works and I find the answer to my questions, sometimes it doesn't. But I don't have hours to spend looking for the answer to my specific question. That's why I prefer not to use forums. They are very tedious to use most of the time. \nIt's not that my computer is necessarily slowing down because it is a \"slow computer\". It's my browser that is slowing down my computer because I have a lot of tabs open and even becoming completely unresponsive where I have to force quit the browser. That's why I am on this Issues page for TGS. To find a way to have more tabs open without my browser crashing or becoming unresponsive to the point of force quitting. I just want to find a way to accomplish this with a extension or app. Or have a way I can to optimize the browser with as much tabs open as possible. I just can't upgrade hardware currently. I know upgrading hardware probably is the way to go though. . @deanoemcke I have noticed that the screen capturing setting is automatically disabled for incognito mode windows whenever the browser is relaunched. Can you fix this? Did you know about this? . @WolfspiritM Sure, I'll try to do that, I'm not that familiar with this site, but it shouldn't be hard. The error 400 has already been resolved however. The zip file for the fix has been posted already, linked somewhere in the comments above. . @deanoemcke I have noticed that the screen capturing setting is automatically disabled for incognito mode windows whenever the browser is relaunched.

Some info regarding what is coming up in the update can be gleaned by reading changelog/timeline. \nI understand that forums can be tedious to search through but for the ones with public posts simply google search for your problem and include (tag) it with the name of the forum and you will see what is has to offer. the first search may not give you the answers you want but may help to refine the search terms so next time your search is more accurate. \n\"Slow computer\" is probably the top IT issue searched for online as people tend not to want to pay for a better computer and try to optimise what they have already; many people cannot afford to upgrade. \nThere are so many factors involved with the issue that unless you are prepared to either pay someone to repeatedly \"fix\" your computer or just upgrade it randomly to the point that it doesn't slow down you need to learn what is happening yourself so you can spot the signs in future. \nComputers are not going away so it is probably time well spent....

    "roastchicken": "@deanoemcke is there anything we can do to help with testing/any other things to speed up the update?. Honestly, the entitlement some people in this thread have is just astonishing.\nThe Great Suspender has obviously benefited many of us immensely, and deanoemcke chooses to spend his time developing it and gives it away for free. Yet you whine about Dean's 'laziness' because he wants to wait before pushing a breaking change to the Chrome Webstore? Come on.\nIf it affects you so much as to spur you to leave a comment complaining about it, why not put in a tiny bit of and install it from source where the bug is already fixed?\nYes, it is irritating that a fix for this bug exists but has not been added to the production version. It would be easier for us if we didn't have to install from the repository. But it is Dean's project and if he doesn't feel it's ready to be pushed, that's his prerogative. There is a clear solution to your problem, and it only takes a minute; use it.. @volt55 just out of curiousity, how much RAM does your computer have?\nI agree with @edsilmon that the next update most likely will not increase the number of tabs you can have open. It's almost definitely not in the alpha updates which you can download right now, as such a change is not mentioned in those release notes.\nUnfortunately, I don't think you'll ever find a way to quadruple the number of tabs you can have open without making hardware changes. Google's (experimental? soon-to-come?) tab discarding feature will probably be more performant than any third-party extensions developed for it, but from what I've heard and experienced in my use of it over the years Chrome is just a memory intensive browser (might not be so true anymore). Not needlessly; it utilizes sandboxing which I believe is the main cause of that. Perhaps your best solution is to change your habits so you have less tabs open.\nI don't mean to be condescending, and perhaps your use case is simply vastly different than mine, but even with me opening almost every link I find interesting and using my tabs as a backlog of things I want to check out: I rarely exceed 50 tabs, and only maybe once or twice have I gone above 100. I make a conscious effort to close the tabs that I've finished reading or are no longer interested in. One thing I do, is if I've opened a bunch of tabs that I'm not going to look at right now I move them all to a new window (shift-click select and drag them) and 'Bookmark all tabs'. This way they take up a negligible amount of RAM, if any at all. Granted, if I do that I often don't ever get back to them. But maybe they weren't that important to me after all.. I can confirm with @fwextensions that clicking on a suspended tab in a window that is not in the foreground unsuspends it exactly as one would expect when clicking on it in the foreground. This is on Windows 10.. I'm also experiencing this. @Harmon758, do you have Screen Capturing turned on?\nWhen I turned Screen Capturing off, clicking \"Suspend this tab now\" in the extension menu worked perfectly and suspended the tab as expected. However when turning it back on, (I have it set to \"Capture top of screen only\" and \"Enable high quality screen capture mode\" is unchecked) \"Suspend this tab now\" in the extension menu doesn't seem to work at all. Further complicating the issue, the \"Suspend/Unsuspend this tab\" option in the context menu works to suspend the tab when Screen Capturing is on.\nI haven't been using the update long enough to fully test if tabs still automatically suspend. Reducing the automatic suspend time to 20 seconds, tabs seem to automatically suspend fine even with Screen Capturing turned on.\nExtension version: 7.0.109\nBrowser & version: Google Chrome Version 68.0.3440.106 (Official Build) (64-bit)\nOperating system & version: Windows 10, version 1803, build 17134.228. Hmmm, interesting. Thank you for the info, I'll have to check out that other issue.\nI can't test it right now, but I'm skeptical I'm experiencing #657 because I can still suspend (and get a screenshot of the page) by triggering a suspend via the context menu. It also doesn't seem to happen only to certain URLs like #657. I didn't check the console, so I don't know yet if I got similar (or any) errors.. ",

    "audi4444player": "@volt55 if you're having trouble having lots of tabs with TGS even though you have 16gb ram then I think the problem is something else on your computer or in the browser, like the cpu or other browser extensions. I love this extension because I use as many tabs as you and my laptop has 16gb ram, maybe you just have too many not suspended tabs at once, chrome uses tons of ram, so you have to make sure that you're suspending everything you're not currently using, I think my laptop can handle about 50-100 \"working\" tabs without causing major failures depending on what they are. (some sites you might not expect use a lot of ram) but when they're suspended I can easily go up to 1000 without lagging. maybe you have too many windows, when I have 1000 tabs that's usually about 4-5 windows, if you use more or less than that it might be the problem? the problems that occur for me seem to be more the cpu (but because I'm usng a thin laptop even my i7 isn't as fast as a lot of desktops) problem is how many are \"working\" and how many are suspended. I usually only crash chrome by doing something myself (like trying to paste 2m likes of code haha), since upgrading to 16gb and using TGS I haven't seen chrome crash from running out of memory since then. for you I would make the suspend time as short as possible and make sure if I'm opening lots of tabs that the old ones are suspended first. just thought I'd see if I could help.\nThanks dean for the  fix, this new version looks pretty too haha, hope to see it as a webstore update some time soon.

While I cannot entirely rule out the possibility that TGS is causing the issue, you're not providing adequate information in a suitable place to provide any assistance. I suggest searching for others experiencing similar problems (either with TGS or otherwise) and seeking out a solution that's already been published. If you're unable to find anything, gather as much information as you can (e.g. disable TGS and see if the problem with menus getting larger persists) and create a new Issue with all of the data and (politely) ask if anybody can help you find the root cause. \nKeep in mind that Github is a platform for collaboration. While creators and maintainers of open source projects ultimately set the course and cadence, the community (that's you and I!) contributes time and effort into triaging issues, finding bugs, fixing bugs, creating new features, and so on. In other words, this is a two way street; if you don't like Dean's timeline, you're encouraged to contribute a solution on a timeline that works better for you.. ",

Is there a milestone checklist of required changes somewhere that myself and others could use to start writing and submitting contributions for? I would really like to help offload some of your burden for the new functionality, even if it's just menial, boring stuff.. @fenixnet-net Hey, just a quick update, I was able to mitigate this with a pretty simple workaround. I use EditThisCookie (on Chromium/Chrome) and I have set a filter up so that any cookie matching gsScrollPos* is blocked from being set on any site. (Edited to fix typo). @meteorplus Are you retarded? Or do you just not read any of the posts in an issue?. @ForsakenHarmony You are demonstrating the height of technical incompetence by complaining about this bug when there are multiple ways of easily mitigating it.. @fenixnet-net It's the only way to guarantee getting an issue closed.. @meteorplus Yes, I've been doing this for many years, long enough to know that insults get issues closed, which is what this issue needs. Locked to contributors. It's getting hammered by people that don't read the comments -- which, by the way, contain more than one easy workaround -- and just complain about not getting an update. It's open source. If it's such a hot-button issue for you, use one of the workarounds, or fix it yourself and install the fix. And saying that isn't the same thing as the \"if you don't like systemd, well, just write your own\" nonsense. It's JavaScript, for crying out loud, in a Chrome extension! But people are being unusually abrasive here, despite this probably being one of the easiest problems to hack around that I've ever seen. The developer even made a thorough post documenting the specific reasons why there isn't a fix available, answering the question you posted earlier. The developer -- who has been kind enough to donate his time and effort and technical skill to solve a gnarly problem -- has made everything clear in this very issue, if you'd only read the comments.. @Invertex I guess you also didn't read the other comments here. This is sort of not unexpected, really pretty typical when the dumb avatar crowd shows up to abuse the developer into doing something they are not willing to do (or not capable of doing) themselves. I won't stand for dumb behavior and comments borne out of ignorance from not having read what's right here.

    "fenixnet-net": "I am also still experiencing this issue.\nIt has been a year. A bugfix patch release is a reasonable thing to do for this kind of issue.\nBarring that, as @curtiszimmerman commented - what's the guidance for community players starting to take on some of this work? I use this extension enough that if it's a matter of pulling out the necessary commits for a patch release to get this issue fixed, I'd do it.. If building from master is an option I'll go have a try with it.\nI definitely understand not wanting to blow up the world. I run ops at a global scale - this isn't new to me. What troubles me is that an abundance of caution seems to have caused what looks like paralysis, at least when I look at the timeline thus far elapsed.\nI don't publish stuff in the chrome webstore, so I can't speak to how that process sucks (although I don't doubt that it does in whatever special ways it has), but a year seems excessive.\nI'll see if I can build master. Thank you for the warning about un-suspending tabs. That might've bit me to my great sorrow.. HUH. Well THAT's neat. I just noticed that I could avoid destroying my sessions by only nuking the gsScroll cookies. Blocking them seems useful. I don't really care about scroll resumption that much....\nYesssss, clever! I'll have a go building from master, but if I decide to stick with the webstore version I'll definitely use this. Thanks!. Build from master successful. Running on the build and have removed the webstore version. I'll see if the issue recurs with this code.\nIf mitigating explosions is an open issue, if it's something that help is wanted with I can see what I can do.. It's not due to any requirement from Google. It's because the current version in the chrome store will break all suspended tabs on update, and there doesn't appear to be any good way to publish that update without it being installed automatically and immediately smashing users' sessions.\nSpecifically addressed by the owner here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/537#issuecomment-322084994. Welp, we've reached the point of namecalling. Time to mute the thread.\nRemember, you all paid NOTHING for this dev's work. If you don't like how they do business you're free to stop using the software. Abusing them for doing stuff with their spare time and volunteer efforts you don't like is the height of entitled bullshit.\nDo better.. ",

I understand he has lots of worries due to how big the userbase is, but you can't just sit around forever, locked out from doing updates because you're afraid to settle on a decision. Eventually he's going to have to update the extension for other reasons in the future. It's better to pull the band-aid off now instead of  delaying as the userbase continues to grow even more, only adding more  pressure on him.. @curtiszimmerman  This isn't about there being personal solutions to the problem. I modified things to solve the issue for myself, that doesn't mean the update shouldn't happen, because I care about this plugin being able to actually update itself properly in the future and not require personal workarounds, and the issue affects many people around the world who wouldn't know enough to know that TGS is even causing the issue for them. It's an important issue to fix for the future of the extension, so try to be a little more mature in your discussion please.. @curtiszimmerman  I love that you're accusing me of the very thing you're doing, classy.

Increasing the imageTimeout did not help and a canvas element is printed to the console rather quickly. Changing the image quality from .8 to .01 of toDataURL did allow the image url to be generated.\nSome possible solutions: 1) Crop the canvas when an empty url is returned and try again. 2) Split the canvas into sections and generate urls from them.

Alright, I decided to try (coz the issue with not immediately working \"suspend this tab\" option was too annoying) n installed latest available TGS extension version from releases here (7.0.131). Aand everything seems to be good, no bugs or lags. \"Suspend this tab\" works immediately as it should. Session management works, saves, imports sessions correctly. + With windows restart there's no more chrome being restored, it just sits in tray as it supposed to until I open it myself with a shortcut. + When chrome starts it gradually goes through all the tabs by itself loading theirs icons, Great. + Enabled this \"Chrome's built-in memory-saving\" option, not like I see a difference yet, but I guess yeah it's better to use built-in functionality, it just works.

Interesting tho, if u try to repeat the \"bug\" with the same (previously auto-suspended back) tab, it's not there, it loads even if u fast change tab to another, but if u try to repeat it with a new tab, it's there. Not annoying but still noticeable.. @deanoemcke Ok, updated to the latest 140, checked \"losing focus\" bug, it's no more, now everything looks n works just fine, no more issues yet, thanks.. Regarding the second issue, tab in question close, chrome full restart, open tab/url again, it helped. Now when suspended, icon is there, no more blank. idk what it was.\nPlus two more things.\n\n\nWhen chrome starts (uses CPU 100% n memory like crazy, not touching it) it loads (not unsuspends I guess) all suspended tabs, while so, some tabs' icons becoming or being not pale (like in not suspended state), while others being pale (as they should), 50/50 I think, some bright, some pale, then with time when chrome finishes (CPU/RAM (more than 2/3)/disk load drops) and ready to work, most of the tabs (almost all) getting paled/shadowed, but there's some 5-10 tabs still being left bright, and when I go clicking through them, they being like \"loaded\" and their icons paled. Not a big issue for now, I think.\n\n\nWhen exporting/saving session to txt it doesn't include titles (checked with a new 140, same)? icons? So when I imported, then resuspended this session (when I uninstalled TGS store 109 version to install unpacked 131 then, I had not so old session txt 109 backup before chrome got updated and session management stopped working completely), well icons were there, but no titles, just urls, hmm.. Is it possible to save/load urls' titles/positions when exporting/importing session? + It's good that extension folder name and suspended.html url not being saved to txt (I'm talking bout \"chrome-extension://oojijclmpkicnfdlc..blabla/suspended.html\"), coz they r different with store and unpacked version. + Also thought bout exporting TGS extension settings, like options, shortcuts, whitelisted sites, etc.. that would be nice feature, but yeah not so necessary when u not uninstalling extension/changing folders, but there could be use cases, like when using ur settings on a new PC/OS without Google Chrome account login, just saying, for the future maybe.\n\n\nAlright, that's all for now, I think. Thanks.. Restarted PC several times recently, even if all chrome windows closed (last closed window had all tabs suspended) before restart (but it still works in background/sits in tray), when Windows restarts at start it still \"restores\" chrome with TGS \"restoring\" my last closed window/session and doubling it, soo yep, issue is still here, 7.0.140. I guess my previous corresponding feedback was incorrect.. @deanoemcke Installed latest 143 version + Chrome got updated to 72.0.3608.4 (Official Build) dev (64-bit):\n1. Well, unfortunately it's not fixed, looks the same as on my above screeny.\n\n\nTried, the problem appeared again, all YouTube tabs were blank after I restored session (window) using TabCloud extension (coz it saves page's titles when un/installing TGS extension, tho now I just copy-paste files in extension folder and let it update itself on start rather than un/install it manually). I prefer externally save (or restore, if smth wrong) windows coz there was time TGS Session management didn't work after yet another Chrome update. Tho the blank favicons issue was solved when I completely (with exit) restarted Google Chrome, all tabs' icons were reloaded, good.\n\n\nI think high CPU load at start is ok, so that now I know for sure where it comes from. About the issue, I tried full restart Chrome several times already and for now almost all tabs' icons being faded when start process finishes and load drops. Almost, so as u said, some tabs are failing to completely load (some have blank, others TGS extension icon instead of their favs), for me it's 5-7 of them (not much), but It's not a big deal, coz just click/load them is enough for favicon to appear + I don't see bright icons anymore, that's good, they all TGS icon at start, then CPU load, then yeah, all as described above.\n\n\nMm that backup feature would be nice, for in case smth goes wrong with extension/Chrome updates or for other use cases (like extension folder name change when switching from store version to unpacked, etc.). So thanks, maybe later I create a separate request. For now I'm ok with external (TabCloud) tabs/windows saving (just in case) and copy-paste files from zip TGS extension updating. Definitely not urgent thing, soo for later.\n\n\nYep, I guess it was a duplicate, but now, with 143, issue is finally solved! No more on Windows startup Chrome \"restoring\" last window and doubling it's tabs + no more doubling on each Chrome full restart + Session management always works and exports tabs to txt correctly. Also I noticed Chrome now uses even less memory when all tabs suspended than before TGS versions (with \"built-in memory-saving\" checked). Great! \ud83d\udc4d. @deanoemcke Installed 144 + Google Chrome now is 72.0.3610.2 (Official Build) dev (64-bit):\n\n\nYep, fixed, for me it looks like this, all good and fine:\n\n\n\n\n\nWell there's no more completely all blank icons for one site (like YouTube or else), now it's more problem 3.\n\n\na) I restarted Chrome to update TGS and when it started there were left unfaded 3 bright icons + 4 YouTube blank icons (they were like before: \"click/load them is enough for favicon to appear\" and be faded) but no more TGS extension like icons were present after load. + When Chrome was starting first I saw all tabs' icons being TGS extension like then I saw them all bright for less than a second and then they all faded (I guess that's normal), good, juust except those 7. b) Then I full restarted Chrome again and there was a messs, half tabs were left bright, some blank, some TGS like, so I went through all of them with ctrl + tab and they all loaded/faded as usual, hmm. c) After, I restarted Chrome for the third time, aand when it loaded there were no bright, blank or TGS like icons left, just all faded, hmmm. d) Restarted again, TGS like icons -> bright -> all faded, hmmmm. I think it might be fixed for now, maybe all icons now stored or smth idk the \"new way\" with some your new fixes so they don't appear else than faded. Soo I'll let u know here if issue appears again.. Updated TGS to 147, Google Chrome is the same 72.0.3610.2 (Official Build) dev (64-bit), full restarted Chrome couple times aand looks like it's all fixed now, as u said no more blank or bright icons, at start I see how suspended tabs (suspendy face) gradually loading (from left to right, all of them, smth like 5 tabs at a time) and being faded every time I restart Chrome (no else than faded icons being left after), Great.\n\n\nJust one minor thing I noticed while updating TGS and basically I think it's OK. Here's what I did:\n\nAll tabs suspended. Somewhere in the middle of all tabs one tab selected, YouTube for example.\nChrome -> Exit.\nCopy paste new files from zip to unpacked TGS extension folder.\nChrome start.\n\nAnd here's the thing. When Chrome starts with TGS ext files updated this \"updated\" page opens up. So here Chrome starts with all tabs suspendy face and starts loading them, but there's a moment when tabs' loading was just started and here opens \"updated\" page changing focus from previously (before Chrome exit/TGS files update) selected tab (somewhere in the middle) to this \"updated\" page (at the end) showing it, at this time I saw previously selected tab being bright while all else being suspendy face to faded loading, when loading got to this bright tab it was faded as all others before and after it, so not an issue, just decided to mention it here (if we're talking no blank or bright tabs' icons like at all). + When I just restart Chrome (no TGS update) I don't see any blank or bright icons (only suspendy to faded) + I don't see current or last selected (before exit) tab being bright coz it's focused and has a close cross X on it instead any icon and I don't try to change tabs while Chrome starts/loading. So here I guess the bright icon now appears only once with TGS extension update and \"updated\" page focus.. Using latest Chrome stable 71.0.3578.80 (Official Build) (64-bit) version portable (from here: https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google-chrome-portable-64 ) and 152 TGS all seems to be fine, at least tabs getting loaded, favicons ok, no blank, right click menu in place and suspension works from there and from extension menu. Except Session management, it doesn't work, it looks the same as from scr4 above, no tabs even for current session. Also these errors appear at Chrome portable start:\n\n\nAnd this one (appears when I open Session management and click '+' to open any session, current also):\n. Full restarted several times. Errors right after Chrome stable portable start:\n\n\nAlso with every restart I'm getting bombarded with this security message (scr below), I guess it's coz errors above.\n. This error I see right when I start my usual updated Chrome dev 72.0.3626.7:\n\nAnd this one appears later when I try to suspend some new tab from extension menu (coz right click one is gone as described):\n\nAlso wanted to mention that I use the same (Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default) Chrome profile folder for my dev 72.0.3626.7 and stable 71.0.3578.80 portable Chrome versions, for installed dev it's default folder and for portable I just start it using GoogleChromePortable64\\App\\Chrome-bin\\chrome.exe (not GoogleChromePortable64\\GoogleChromePortable.exe) so it uses the same folder. And it seems that the same profile works fine with Chrome stable (with some errors + not working Session management) and TGS all breaks with dev.. Updated TGS to latest 153 version. When started Chrome dev, it's all the same, TGS doesn't work, even usual after update TGS 'updated' page didn't appear. But when started stable portable Chrome version all was fine, even 'updated' appeared, tho errors and security message didn't go anywhere.. @CollinChaffin I would be glad to help and test your build but I think we still may need @deanoemcke's help as we don't know the project the way Dean does.. Tested your commit, it appears to be working on the latest Chrome 73.0.3639.1 (Official Build) dev (64-bit), TGS initiates with no errors (and so I'm not getting bombarded with that \"Disable developer mode extensions\" Chrome security message on every restart), all tabs with correct paled favicons after load, good. Tab suspending works, only just noticed one error when suspended new google.com tab for the first time, when donation notification arrived at the bottom left corner it was with no urled images, just text (see screeny), and this \"new\" error I saw in extension errors after:\n\n\nAlso Session management still looks like this as described in my issue #822 and throws the same error with '+' click:\n\n\nSo the help of @deanoemcke is still needed here.. @deanoemcke I updated TGS to the latest 158 build, donate buttons confirm fixed, about session management, sent u an email.. Checked this PR, all seems fine and as I suggested in the comments earlier, thanks. Also checked commit f1f1426 , all russian good too, even if it was translated with Google Translate :D. @byaka in Google Chrome Extensions TGS extension details there's 2 settings that probably should be turned on: site access - on all sites and allow access to file urls, I guess in Vivaldi should be these settings too as it's Chromium based browser, idk maybe this info could help u.. also u could try latest TGS dev build and check if ur issue still persists, I recently wrote an expanded answer how to here. 159 tried, also can't replicate the issue. Tab with russian text in url unsuspends as usual, with click almost anywhere in it.. @MonsterNya I'm using 159 now as I wrote above and here's how u can too as I assume u don't know how to use the latest development version: go to TGS github main page here https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender , green button clone or download , download zip (direct url https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/archive/master.zip , it is the latest 160 now version, latest commit from our ram savior, developer dear @deanoemcke ), unpack zip anywhere u'd want it to stay (like maybe into ur Chrome browser folder), then in TGS settings, make a screenshot of it, copy ur never suspend urls list to somewhere (to save it if u have it), then after, in session management, export the current session, also to save it externally, and here u can remove ur TGS Chrome Web Store version (which is usually far behind latest, for reasons) from Chrome Extensions, then enable developer mode and load unpacked TGS extension from previously unzipped folder thegreatsuspender-master\\src , exactly from src, that's where extension really is, recover ur settings, import ur session aand I guess that's it, u r on latest version. From now on to update extension u will have to manually download zip from time to time and unpack it to it's 'stay' folder replacing files while Chrome is preferably exited. Also I think there may be another way, without removing current Web Store version, to find TGS extension folder in ur Chrome profile (usually somewhere here C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Extensions with the name of the folder being that line of letters from any of ur suspended tab's url), then in that folder I assume there's may be another folder with the Web Store TGS extension version name, something 109 for now, exit Chrome, delete everything from this 109 folder, copy/paste to it all files from zip src, start Chrome and I think TGS should get updated here, but I'm not sure, will it even work? And how it will get along with Web Store, maybe it will tell u extension was 'corrupted' aka wanna repair (reinstall)? I didn't use this method but feel free to try, of course with backups ;) Oh n updating here also will be the same manual files replacing from zips but from just src folder. But again idk how it will be with the Web Store, how it updates then. Uh anyway, good luck, check ur issue with the latest version and let the dev kno if u do ^_^. @MonsterNya backing up Chrome extensions may be tricky coz C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Extensions folder I think only stores static files for Chrome Web Store extensions (not their settings, just extensions themself), and where their settings then? I found some answers here https://superuser.com/questions/942392/how-can-i-modify-data-stored-by-chrome-extensions . So when I searched through files in Default folder with the TGS folder name from any suspended url, for me it is gbcokmhikpgllchhjdjdklejaicdbhmg, it found 2 folders: C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\IndexedDB\\chrome-extension_gbcokmhikpgllchhjdjdklejaicdbhmg_0.indexeddb.leveldb and C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Sync Extension Settings\\gbcokmhikpgllchhjdjdklejaicdbhmg , so I guess that's where TGS stores it's settings, but even if u copy those files and paste/replace them later with new TGS installation, they may be overwritten when Chrome starts so no settings will be gotten from them. Soo how to backup settings of a particular extension and then recover them successfully I myself don't know yet, needs more googling I guess.. But how to save all Extensions, their settings as well as all Chrome settings and profile, yep, just copy Default folder and that's it.\nAnd I'm glad the problem u had is now gone, so dev can close this issue \ud83d\ude0a\nI think TGS gets language setting from chrome://settings/ Languages, tho switch is a good idea and u could probably go create new issue (feature request) for TGS here on github, for now u could change ur entire Chrome browser language to English (United States), I guess that may be not such a big problem for u as u know English to some extent obviously and that's if my assumption about where TGS gets its language setting is correct.\nAbout translation, the original English is here https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/blob/master/src/_locales/en/messages.json and russian is here https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/blob/master/src/_locales/ru/messages.json , press the pencil to fork and edit the file then u could create a new pull request with ur corrections for dev and everybody else to comment and review (more how-to on the process I think u could find in google here). Have fun, it would be nice to see ur corrections \ud83d\ude09. @deanoemcke, installed the latest 164 build, looks like the issue is gone, so let's consider it's fixed now, thanks!. @deanoemcke updated to the latest 165, all works as described above by you, previously suspended sites being suspended immediately while loading if told to with my issue starting bug fixed (so not being reloaded right after), also new sites have to completely load as u said to suspend, not being suspended while loading (if commanded to), I think it's rational considering title and screen capture reasons, checked with several new sites, and again, all works.\n@MonsterNya idk what were u talking here, but if u still have the described bug, even with updated TGS to 165 version, well give more info, u could even record gif video like I did with this little program: ScreenToGif.. @MonsterNya thanks for the video and I guess that's exactly what was described by dev here:\n\nThere is some code to say that if this tab has never been suspended before, then it MUST wait for the tab to finish loading before suspending, otherwise it can't get the proper page title (or screen capture if that setting is enabled).\n\nso check if it suspends immediately (as it should, also described by dev in the next paragraph of his answer above) for the second time for the same latest 165 instance of TGS extension (without switching to older 160), after it was loaded or manually stopped (X pressed after <- -> at Chrome top left) for the first time. @MonsterNya bout code I got u, but what r u talking after, can u explain, maybe show?. @MonsterNya r u talking bout that if u pressed/commanded tab to suspend while it's still loading for the first time it doesn't remember ur command and doesn't suspend right after loading is done as u think it should and so u have to command it to suspend again to have it finally suspended or what r u talking here?. > line 6. context menu.

\"\u0443\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c\"\n\nSo, I agree with @MonsterNya.\nAnd also please note \"\u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\" (verb) instead of \"\u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\" (noun).\n\n@AlexWayfer I agree with ur version in russian, that's what I would offer myself on par with \"\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438\" (open without suspension) but with \"\u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0442\u044c\" (load) it sounds more accurate like what exactly will be done if pressed. Also I +1 ur correction for russian export.\nAbout original English variant I guess we could ask for developer @deanoemcke's opinion here.. @AlexWayfer I'm creating pull request there now based on latest dev's English additions, wait a bit. > Are we all happy with merging this PR now? (ignoring those issues handled in other internationalisation branch).\nI guess not yet, but maybe soon. Alright, created PR here with russian translation for dev's latest English changes, @MonsterNya, @AlexWayfer, @deanoemcke, please review and approve, thank u.. Hi, I know u may be upset bout some TGS bugs and crashes, but could u please fill the information u provided to the appropriate form in ur comment description, not in its title. In title just briefly describe the problem, smth like The Great Suspender stopped working, crashes. Believe me putting it all in title won't get ur issue reviewed faster by developer who I assume works on this amazing project in his free time which we all may have not much.\nAlso please give more information on ur bugs and crashes, it may really speed up the process of fixing them. For example what were u doing, step by step, like 1. starting Chrome, 2. pressing here, 3. seeing that and thinking it's not ok (make a screenshot of it to attach and show ur issue here). Plus u could use this (ScreenToGif) little convenient program to make a video gif (like I did here) to show ur problems with TGS in more simple and clear way as well as briefly describe them.\nAbout versions, The Great Suspender extension version u could find in three vertical dots at the top right corner of Chrome window -> More tools -> Extensions, find TGS extension and to the right of its name u will see its exact version, u can select and copy/paste it here, ur Chrome browser version u could find in the same dots -> Help -> About Google Chrome, there u'll see the line starting with Version, u can also copy/paste it, and finally, ur exact Windows 10 version u could find in Start button at the bottom left of ur screen -> Settings -> System -> About -> Windows specifications, here u need Version and OS build, u may not be able to copy/paste this data, but I think u could just rewrite it.\nAnd last but not least, u could try latest TGS dev build (which is 7.0.162 now and a lot was fixed since latest Chrome Web Store build 7.0.109 which u may have installed, developer not frequently updates Web Store version for reasons, all latest fixes always here, on github) and check if ur issues still persist, I wrote an expanded answer how to here.\nWell that's it, I hope ur TGS issues will get solved so u could support this Great project and its developer \ud83d\ude09. I support this feature request with default language being Chrome's current ui language.\n@MonsterNya ur Chrome browser and Windows 10 exact versions u could find like I explained here in about versions section of my answer, not that this information is somehow important (it's not) with this feature request, but for ur future possible issues it may be \ud83d\ude0a\nEdit: Aww saw ur latest issue as well as looked closely to yours old, sorry for mentioning the information about versions u already know, well at least I hope it may help someone else if seen.. Hmm, on the second thought I also ask myself why and what for but can't come to a reasonable enough answer.\n@MonsterNya like if u wanned to switch to English coz russian translation had too many errors, well now, thanks to us, it's all Great, what else there may be? \ud83e\udd14. So it is Windows specific, ook, smth like selected tabs getting unselected with rmb on the page... Also ran into this issue some time ago, unsuspension of all tabs is a nightmare for me, so I never ever use it, most of the time I have no more than 5-7 tabs unsuspended.\nPlus extension should behave correctly when told to suspend all tabs while they're all in the process of being unsuspended, suspend them all back immediately, like if user changed mind. It happened to me, when all tabs were unsuspending and CPU + RAM was gone, I tried to press suspend all tabs in all windows (even forced option), nothing happened, my pc was done, I had to open task manager and end Chrome there, only then I was able to start new empty Chrome window and restore my tabs from session management, tho all tabs' titles were lost, which was extremely bad to me, which is why I wanna session management save them too... > @deanoemcke, maybe \"js_session_save_point\": { \"message\": \"Automatic save point for v\" } should be \"Automatic save point for version \" for more obvious.\n@AlexWayfer hmm to me current \"...v\" seems ok, it' shorter, minimalistic, I like it that way, but I get ur point when even Chrome on the page chrome://settings/help uses full word \"version\". @AlexWayfer me too + I'm also interested, maybe I'll give it a try to see in action \ud83d\ude05 And I like ur suggestion to use contraction for russian version but I'm not sure, let's wait for @MonsterNya, what he may say here. Alright then, let's leave \"js_session_save_point\": { \"message\": \"\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0438 \" } as is in russian, and @deanoemcke may change English if he's ok with it. Aand I guess that's it with this PR here.. I guess dev may soon push the 7.1 TGS extension update to Chrome Web Store and what u asking for is already an existing feature for a long time, even for 7.0.109 version that's now sitting there since August 25, 2018, tho it may be quite buggy, but it's all fixed with the latest dev 7.0.167 version for sure.. I like how new dot version looks, using latest commit c245df543f615a018d1e2fb15d00a83fb84ee8fc\n\nAnd I would suggest to make it look the same in settings, with dot also (and no need to touch font size here below):\n. 7.0.171, I confirm that, even if position saved in suspended tab url \"pos\", it's lost when unsuspended.. I guess u could use pause suspension option for PDF tab, which will temporarily (until tab is reloaded) pause it. Also what version of TGS extension u r using? Look for it on Extensions page in Chrome settings.. @MReed1959, well latest Chrome Web Store TGS version is 7.0.109, developer not frequently updates it there for reasons, but u could try latest TGS dev build 7.0.173 c245df543f615a018d1e2fb15d00a83fb84ee8fc, a lot was fixed since 109, but as I just checked with 173 installed, TGS does not save scroll pos in Chrome PDF, which may be an issue, but it has rmb \"pause/unpause suspension of this tab\" option, that's for sure, + \"not now\"/\"unpause\" when u click on extension itself in Chrome toolbar. About how to try dev build I wrote here, and I would add now that there may be no need to remove current Web Store version, just disable it and install dev unpacked is enough I guess, along with other backup/restore instructions. Aand I think there may be no need for you to try dev version right now if urs current 7.0.104 has pause option (can't remember if it does), it should be ok then, but if this PDF scroll thing is actually an issue and gets fixed by developer, latest dev build will have those fixes so u could try it later, just in case wrote u how to.. @deanoemcke hmm I guess that privacy url may be added to TGS's settings about page somewhere.. Hmm but couldn't you use pause suspension option for inspected tab? But yeah, feature request for TGS to pause automatically when tab being inspected is interesting as TGS does when there's receiving text input on the page (if told so in settings).. @wdhwg001 Thanks for info even though I'm not a developer here and you didn't answer whether you tried to use pause option for inspected tab. And what you couldn't reproduce? Issue's somehow gone and TGS now auto-pauses itself when tab inspected? And what got updated, from which version to what? Give more details, it may help the actual dev to address your feature request.. @wdhwg001 I think there's no need to create a new issue for this feature request, so yea u could change the title and that seems enough. And using Chrome 74.0.3717.0 (Official Build) dev (64-bit) I confirm TGS 7.0.173 does not auto-pause suspension of inspected tab. Also I think that this is a feature request and not an issue or bug and not an important one coz it doesn't affect general user and those who may be affected can use a pause option to get over it. Plus if dev decides to implement this feature I wonder whether docked or undocked inspector be treated differently and how undocked one will be detected. What if inspector was opened and closed several times. What if html/css/js.. page was changed in inspector, what if inspector was closed after, etc.. I think as feature it could be implemented without option to enable/disable it, just enabled by default with (when u click on sleepy suspendy face) phrase being (by analogy with tab receiving form input) smth like inspector opened for this tab or tab has visible inspector or smth about debugging session with unpause option right after.. Hmm I think these favicons issues were fixed long since v7.0.109, u may try latest dev build as unpacked extension n see if issues still persist then.. Download latest dev build from master branch as zip. Backup ur tabs + export them to file through TGS settings session management. Disable TGS v7.0.109 in Chrome Extensions but be warned that all suspended tabs will disappear once u disable extension so either have them backed up or unsuspended/loaded. Unpack previously downloaded zip somewhere to separate folder to save it there, great location would be to Program Files/Google folder with separate folder name smth like TGS or The Great Suspender. Load new unpacked extension from separate folder/src, that's where latest TGS dev build will be. To get back to v7.0.109 backup/unsuspend all tabs then just disable latest dev build and enable v7.0.109, suspend tabs, that's it. To update dev build download master branch zip with latest changes, exit Chrome, unpack zip and overwrite files in separate folder/TGS, open Chrome, TGS updated, done. Try to use TGS latest dev build and see if the issue u described persists. A lot was fixed by developer since v7.0.109. And I think ur issue may be fixed too.. @BevBam well there's no need to execute anything, just download, unpack and install, google: chrome install unpacked extension, there should be videos how to, just download github master branch (that u could google too) and install from src folder, basically that's it, but still don't forget bout backup \ud83d\ude09. I guess it's a known and already fixed issue in development version of TGS, see for example #860, #878, issue itself is a duplicate of #719.. @christopherreay, well there're ways to install latest dev version of TGS extension, I was talking about it here, here (near the end, less detailed) and more detailed here (tho now I decided that to remove old version of TGS is unnecessary to try the latest one, just disabling may be enough as I described in my first \"here\" here). Also considering that u have that much Chrome profiles and tabs I guess it may be quite hard to backup (export to file) all of them profile by profile so I would suggest u to backup (copy/paste somewhere else) ur whole C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome profiles and data folder (that's for Windows 10, look for analog on Linux) before u start any updating/trying latest dev version of The Great Suspender in case smth goes wrong and ur tabs lost so u could just delete broken folder and restore it all with original one while Chrome is exited. Then go to profile with least tabs and work with it to try latest dev version of TGS as I suggested in my first \"here\". And here I'm not sure how disabling old version will affect inactive (other) Chrome profiles except current. Logically speaking it shouldn't (coz they're completely separate each with its own instances of extensions) but yeah idk as I have just one Chrome profile so never tried. In current Chrome profile disabling of old TGS will disappear all suspended tabs so unsuspend them before. Then try install latest dev version. But here I also may see a mess coz of difference in extension folder names in Chrome, Web Store TGS may have name gbcokmhikpgllchhjdjdklejaicdbhmg or anything else similar but unpacked latest one may have smth different but also similar so all suspended tabs in other inactive Chrome profiles may have old folder name in their addresses so those tabs won't work with unpacked latest TGS extension. Soo as I can see if u would have one Chrome profile it might be easy to try latest dev version but as soon as u have more it may be quite messy (or it may be not coz all profiles r separate, in every profile its own TGS, just unsuspend all tabs before disable and all ok). Sooo here I suggest u to wait for 7.1 release of TGS in Chrome Web Store and when it comes out to backup ur whole Chrome data folder before any update. And while u waiting u could install as unpacked TGS latest dev version on ur most used Chrome profiles by scheme: unsuspend all, disable, install unpacked, suspend all. Hmm and here I'm thinking again that every Chrome profile is actually like a lone unit and they're not connected so in every Chrome profile u may be have its own TGS version installed soo that scheme above could be repeated for every of ur Chrome profiles but that may be too hard and unnecessary coz u have so much profiles. So update just a few with dev version then wait for update to come out and update all others from Web Store. Then to go back to Web Store version for those with dev one use the scheme: unsuspend all tabs, disable dev version (when there's no suspended tabs left coz they may disappear at the moment), enable old Web Store version, update it to when release 7.1 by clicking Update in Chrome Extensions to manually check for update and update ur installed extensions, suspend all tabs (maybe it needs to be done before update and after enable of old version, not sure) and that's may be it and that for every profile with dev version, then restart Chrome and I guess that's finally it. Why try unpacked dev version on less of ur Chrome profiles? Coz Web Store version can be auto-updated + manually updated with Update button when dev version can be updated only manually by replacing files with new ones from downloaded zip. So here u have it, proceed with caution and backups.. @MonsterNya the purpose and meaning behind that \"Test whitelist\" button explained in this PR and new feature was added by dev since commit bb1ca749d8ab5749787c43dc741a9fa2842cb517 + dev made changes and added some translations. I decided to add some russian translation corrections as dev used google translate and ask u for a quick review coz TGS 7.1 release to Chrome Web Store coming shortly.. I think it means both, at the user's discretion, user can just save the current session in session management or can export it to file and save externally, both can be done in session management, so no specification for backup word, but I guess we could add some explanation about where user can make a backup (coz users don't know anything), so it may look like: ...\"\u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u044d\u043a\u0430\u043f (\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u044e) \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438.\". Can't get the difference between these two questions, can u please explain? Why u asked them? What do u think may be not correct here, at which line?. I would rephrase it like this: ...\"\u0423\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u043b \u0438 \u043e\u043d \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e URL-\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0435.\" Also I shell recommend u to check the whole ur translation in MS Word so there's no simple errors like that in word \"\u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0442\" above \ud83d\ude09.

Also can't find this phrase live, I guess we may need @deanoemcke's help. This message I guess we can only see right before Chrome Web Store TGS version gets updated, so here @deanoemcke's help may also be needed. It does, it's just with \"\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435\" at the start of a sentence we naturally understand that this sentence may be an additional information faster, right away when we start reading it. Also @deanoemcke's help may be needed here coz idk how TGS settings work in incognito mode, I never used TGS there. But if we r talking just about translation of this particular phrase I would just add settings existence info at the end so it'll be like this:\n\"\u0412\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e. \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044b \u0438\u0437 Chrome Sync \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c.\".

Great rephrase, I like it \ud83d\ude0a. I can't assign or use on a suspended tab discard action, only load, coz they'r already discarded, coz I have TGS option \"Apply Chrome's built-in memory-saving when suspending\" enabled and it works. I think discarding works for all tabs if enabled including TGS suspended ones. If discarding disabled in TGS options, suspended tabs just hang in Chrome Task manager (consuming some memory), otherwise they'r not, only active suspended tab does before I unsuspend it and it becomes the usual active tab or just loaded if lost focus. Can't get what u r talking bout, sorry, but if u have a better translation variant, let's review it, and I guess we also may need dev @deanoemcke's help in understanding how it all works here with this one phrase. Well u apparently can select tabs by ctrl + lmb but idk how to suspend them using this rmb option, coz when u rmb on page, selected tabs getting unselected and only one being considered selected, the current. Buut I just discovered if u selected some tabs (>1) then clicked on TGS extension in toolbar there'll be options to suspend/unsuspend selected tabs in bulk. I think that's what those options r for.. Well u may create an issue, sounds reasonable, it would be interesting to know dev's opinion on this topic and why these items there.. @MonsterNya So the second variant does sound better after all:\n\"\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432 Chrome \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a\"\nAlso I would make some little changes to ur final tab-discarding description, I'll comment them below. There's no need to rewrite it completely, it's almost fine now. Even if in English we r talking bout a single suspended tab's memory usage which then comes to 500% memory savings in general, in russian we can start talk plural right from the option line here and continue to its description in tooltip, I guess it makes understanding easier, no talks bout single tab then bout them all, it's all, right from the beginning, so less thinking (stepping from single to plural) on user's end \ud83d\ude01. I would add \"\u0434\u043b\u044f\" here:\n\"\u0415\u0449\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a, \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044f\".

And double down here. We with @MonsterNya agreed on anglicism \"\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043f\u0435\u0440\" here coz of  the specificity of the term and the target audience of this exact line, so let's leave it as it is imo. here I may agree especially considering \"\u0435\u0449\u0451\" being at the end of the sentence. English original says \"html_options_suspend_no_active_tabs\": { \"message\": \"Never suspend active tab in each window\" } here and I agree that \"\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u043c \u043e\u043a\u043d\u0435\" sounds not good enough, I would translate it like:\n\"\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0443 \u0432 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\"\nrussian \"\u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439\" (any) here just feels better than \"\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439\" (every, each), so let's decide... I would agree here too, with \"\u0451\" it just reads more natural, no second thoughts. We r appealing to a single person - user (even if we r don't know that person but just as a form of some extra \"respect\"), so I think capital \"\u0412\u044b\" is good here, isn't it nice if program/extension being that polite with u?. Yep, I support this one, sounds really better. +1 here. I like that suggestion, \u00ab\u0451\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438\u00bb actually do look more correct and nice :3. I support this little \"\u0451\"fication here ^_^ even if we r told by dev not to worry about those lines here but yeah, I'm generally for \"\u0451\", but not like everywhere, so no overuse... ookay. not sure bout here, in the middle of the sentence. here I agree. +1. +1. Well I'm ok with this suggestion, seems more detailed idk. this one is great, I support. Well, okay here. So if u say it's being used in docs, well let's leave urs actually original variant then. Alright, and I like urs double negation variant, I would just add \"\u0438\u0437\" here:\n\"\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\"\nlike none in one of the (opened) windows.

What about swap? DRAM?\nSo instead of \"\u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439\" (system) which word should be used in russian translation then, if not \"\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439\" (ram)?

And I think most of users in general will barely even understand what \"\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439\" (ram) is, not speaking of swap, DRAM, etc..

By changes I meant for word \"\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0439\", to add it, but we decided not to, so\nat least here no changes needed for now\n\nsorry for my English, I guess \ud83d\ude44\nAnd imo we should use \"\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439\" (ram) as it is now, I think we may even ask @deanoemcke  what he meant by \"system memory\" as we should not translate literally, was it ram? or anything else? coz if ram we should go with \"\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439\" and that's it.. I vote for the first variant, so \"html_about_indexedDb_prefix\" should be:\n\"\u0422\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0451\u0440\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f indexedDb \u2014 \"\nand \"html_about_indexedDb_suffix\":\n\", \u043e\u0442 Aaron Powell.\"\nbut there's may be a problem, coz live it may look like:\n\u0422\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0451\u0440\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f indexedDb \u2014 db.js , \u043e\u0442 Aaron Powell.\nextra space and this space is not in \"html_about_indexedDb_suffix\".\nAlso I'm not sure bout em dash \u2014, maybe there should be en dash \u2013?.

I'll try ...\nFrom a user's perspective it's cool to have the feature to automatically lower the CPU/memory usage when there's no actions in the browser or only one tab is active. Better UX, but the \"issue\" with this approach is in the average suspended time of inactive tabs. Users like me almost always read many and long articles combined with a shorter ones - expressed in time it is between 5-10 minutes to an hour in reading. This time doesn't help when in the middle of reading the user must switch to another tab to quickly check more info. What happens after that is the following:\n1. That another tab is already suspended, which leads to some pause (1-2 sec) before it reloads automatically and eats the same traffic again (people on mobile internet/platforms have traffic limit, which is unknown how much MB left they have). I propose it will be better to cache on the hard drive  each suspended tab\n2. Sometimes this auto-reload doesn't work, in my case I should manually click, which is additional workflow breaker (especially for noob coders like me). But if the tab reloads I must again scroll to the page's area of interest\n3. Sometimes the page in the suspended tab is not reachable (for example connection issues on both sides), and if there's a information in some degree of importance for the current work of the user, he or she cannot proceed it. This is somewhat fixable with opening last known Google or WebArchive's page cache ... And yeah, it's possible to white-list all those pages, but because the user don't know information from which page is more usable, white-listing all new opened pages always means he or she must read them before deciding that. Also there are two clicks - usually long mouse travel to click TGS icon > Never suspend ...\nSo, I am proposing to add option to choose suspended time based on collected average suspended time per tab, plus enhancing it using classifier based on the type of the page (there's an exception, for example programming articles are from micro-size to a huge novel). This is possible with check for a specific words in ,  or if there is another standardized section which explains what information the site provides. ",

As soon as you turn syncing on, it will overwrite the options of all other computers logged into the same chrome profile that also have the settings sync option on.\n@saurabhgayali could you tell me whether this option was ON or OFF for you?\nI would like to investigate whether there is an issue with the code that determines the above behaviour.\n\nThe options where whatever is default. and this wasn't an option in older version..

    "Anyasia": "@deanoemcke Hi, that was me on Twitter.\nThe reason I accidentally reported it as being from an update to 6.30 is in fact because my session history did include an automatic save point, but it was labelled 'Automatic save point for v6.30.' This session matched the tabs which were restored following the update, and although it didn't have a date associated with it, comparing it to sessions listed in the 'Recent Sessions' section, it seems to've been from around 19:54 24 August, while the update occurred around 14:37 25 August. In the meantime I'd opened and closed several tabs, as you might imagine, and while nothing too important was lost for me, it was obviously a bit annoying.\nNow, three things of note stood out to me:\n\nWhen I checked at the beginning of making this post, there were several identical 'Recent Sessions' dated to 19:54 24 August;\nThere didn't seem to be any more recent sessions under that list, either from before or after the update; and\nWhen, because of the above, I decided to take the precaution of making a manual backup of my current session, it cleared all but one of those duplicated 'Recent Sessions.'\n\nI'm not sure when it normally makes automatic backups to be put under that 'Recent Sessions' header, but it doesn't seem to've done so for me recently, which, considering I have had to rely on them on occasion when Chrome itself loses my session after a crash, is a bit concerning. I'll keep an eye on it and report back if I notice the behavior changing.\nThanks for your attention to this issue; it's greatly appreciated! If there's anything else I can do to help, please let me know.. @deanoemcke That's very odd that you say it existed in the previous release, since I've only noticed it as a problem since the update. Given how noticeable a change it was, I even wonder if I'd previously somehow missed an update and was still using a much older version.\nPausing the extension would certainly be a welcome feature, and would mitigate some of my concern with the behavior. Still going to be a usage pattern change to relearn, but ~~given I just noticed this latest release also removed the 'don't suspend for now' option from the extension dropdown anyway,~~ it seems that I shall have to be doing that anyway! ;)\nEdit: I'm blind. -_-\nThanks again for your attention to this matter..

    "RobertAb1": "During last The Great Suspender update, Chrome changed order of my tabs. Now, I have a complete mess.\nI left computer for 15 min, and when I got back I saw message from extension that it just updated, but it saved my tabs before. And after that I found out that the order of tabs was changed. It is possible that this problem appeared as a consequence of session manager function implemented in the extension. Browser did not restart in the meantime (I checked from what time Chrome processes were running in Process Explorer).\nAfter analysis, I found out that the order of tabs was changed for this which were less than 1-2 months old. Order tabs maintained position. Affected tabs were both suspended and not suspended. The same was about not affected tabs. It seems that no tabs were added or removed.\nAddendum:\nI am using also other extensions: Sloth, Session Buddy, and more.. @deanoemcke\nIn my case, there were the same tabs, but in different order.\nAnd the order of tabs was changed for some suspended tabs and also for some not suspended tabs. The criterion was rather when the tab was created (1-2 months earlier). But in my case, I restarted Chrome 10-20 h earlier, and Session Buddy did save session during previous Chrome closing.. Tabs Backup & Restore is not maintained anymore. . We have problem here with Chrome and missing futures and APIs for session managers. \nTBH, Waterfox is my main browser, but I am using Chrome just to see how \"competition\" is doing.\nMaybe I could propose to use: \n(1)   Firefox 61 + Session Sync (or MySessions or Tab Session Manager), or\n(2)   Firefox 56/Waterfox 56.2.2 + Session Manager (works even better). :)\nFirefox has already lazy tabs implemented natively few years ago, and they are working perfectly. \nhttps://github.com/ReDEnergy/SessionSync/issues/44\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6xH2pxt9wJS2XqUOaOfxyA\nBut seriously, how often do you restart your Chrome? I have noticed on my that Session Buddy is saving session 1 time every 1 restart. And after problem caused by The Great Suspender, I was able to recover my tabs using Session Buddy's saved session.. How often do you restart your Chrome?. @mkrier\nSo you are getting 1 saved session per restart. The same as I do.\nSo I will give you simple advice. Do restarts daily, or more often if you are introducing important changes (opening/closing a lot of windows).\nLooks like the problem with Session Buddy is solved :). @mkrier\nI completely agree: backups should be done automatically. And they are during restart :)\nBut I need to tell you. Session Manager in Firefox/Waterfox never/ever gave me problems. Never. The best session manager ever made. Also in Firefox/Waterfox, I never have problems with the order of tabs in window even after some accidents (like Windows blue screen). In Chrome, the order of tabs is ALWAYS changed. That is way, I am using now Waterfox.. @mkrier\nAt least, I will know not to worry about Session Buddy.\nThe main reason, I am restarting Chrome is to speed it up, and to make it to use less resources.\nHave a nice day.. New session manager for Chrome:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-session-manager/iaiomicjabeggjcfkbimgmglanimpnae\nIt is available for Firefox for longer period of time:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-session-manager/.

    "mopquill": "I also had this happen, and the windows that went missing were \"older\" windows/tabs I had been restoring for a while. I don't use any extension to do this, I just kill all chrome.exe processes, and it asks me if I want to restore when I next launch. This has been the most foolproof method of getting my tabs back.\nAfter restoring my tabs in this way, all of a sudden a bunch of windows and tabs closed as the Great Suspender tab popped up, just needing to do a little maintenance. Weirdly, it closed some of my tabs on the windows that remained open. Fortunately, the Session Management tab linked to worked to restore my missing windows/tabs, but it was very jarring. Anyhow, just seconding to add data to the pile.. @deanoemckeI lost tabs. I used my most recent recovery to get most of them back. The windows/tabs that were missing were ones I have had open for quite a long time -- a few months at least. I have windows of \"projects\" and if I expect to do that project soon, but haven't gotten to it or received the info I need, I just leave it open and suspended. The Great Suspender only recovered the most recent 3 windows, and not all the tabs from them, either.\nIt updated while I was reading something on a new window in incognito (I had two other incognito windows open), and all of a sudden I was looking at a partial of my primary window, the incognito windows were gone, and 3/7 of my windows were present. I considered uninstalling The Great Suspender, but I read everything, understood the situation, and was able to get most of my tabs back via looking through some past sessions.\nTo be clear, the tabs that got reloaded were about 20% of what I had open when it decided to update (15% if you count the three incognito windows I lost, but fortunately those were just searches I could re-type out and find the same results). I didn't get any sort of notice or anything, if that was already supposed to be in the addon. I managed to recover everything but my main window's tabs -- it also closed almost all of my pinned tabs, which was weird. So I had to re-open/pin things, but again, the list was in restored stuff, it was just some tabs I opened that day that I lost entirely.\n@mkrier I used to do that, actually, but in some circumstances, that doesn't work! It doesn't seem to restore sessions for one, so I have to log into a lot of stuff again, and I've once had it happen where it hung while it was closing, and killing the process -- ironically, caused it not to restore upon relaunch. I couldn't get any restore addons to work for me, and this does, so, not fixing what ain't broke. XD. ",

Hi\nYes you are correct, I am referring to \"suspending\" sorry for the confusion.\nYes, I am referring to the 'suspend all other tabs' in the pop-up menu.\nThat previously functioned as a 'force all tabs closed in this window' button.\nIdeally, the 'suspend all other tabs' functions as a 'force all tabs closed in this window' regardless of whether there is active input data in the tab or not.\nIf you would like this feature to remain separate from the current options than I would recommend adding a third option 'force all tabs closed in this window' in addition to the one you have \"force suspend all tabs in all windows' as I view that as the nuclear option.\nWhat do you think about this?\n. Hi\nThe 'suspend all other tabs' option does not suspend white-listed tabs or tabs with active input. So if you have 15 tabs of a whitelisted site active then the only way to suspend them is to go in and manually suspend each one individually. That's too arduous and tedious to do when we take into account the application used to do that by default in the previous build version.\nI think an ideal additional feature setting would be to add an option to force all tabs to suspend regardless of whitelist or active input in the settings section of the application. You can turn it off/on in the settings section and by default perhaps it is off.\nI think that is a good compromise for design and functionality?\nThe primary concern if the feature isn't added is that you have to manually suspend tabs of whitelisted sites. If you have a window with 10+ whitelisted tabs then that's a lot to go in and manually suspend.. > Is there any reason why this option is only available in the context menu, and not from within the icon menu as well?\nThe option you're referring to doesn't exist at all.\nThere is only suspend all tabs in all windows or suspend other tabs which doesn't force suspend all tabs.. \n\nWhat is this then, Scotch mist?\n\nThat's the force ALL tabs in ALL windows feature.\nThat's not the feature we're discussing.\nWe're discussing force suspend all tabs in this window except the active tab\nPlease re-read everything..

    "ressikanflute": "Changing the flags as described here certainly helped me.\nhttps://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/793#issuecomment-430601077\nI have atm 1825 tabs in Chrome 70.0.3538.110\nTGS v7.0.109\nMy problems started after I formatted my PC. The only change after the format was a new TGS version since autoupdate wasn't enabled or doesn't exist or whatever.\nI had ran with TGS v6.3 for quite some time. Never any problem at all with all my tabs in whichever size they have been. Immediately after the format, after I got a notification on the extension icon, Chrome became more and more sluggish until it told me TGS had ran out of CPU and RAM and had been turned off. Then suddenly Chrome became normal and responsive, so I manually restarted TGS. Was fine for some time, but after a little while I noticed Chrome became sluggish again. Progressed into badlands from there on, but at least it stayed above the crash treshold. Functioned fine for 10+ seconds then CPU-usage went through the roof and Chrome froze for at least 5 seconds. This is the new Chrome life from here on. 10s normal usage then 5s freeze, rinse and repeat.\nThis happens every time I start Chrome now after 7.0.109 got installed. Slugs eat up TGS until it crashes, then 10s/5s rotation in endless loop. No change of behavior after Chrome and Windows updates.\nBehavior with TGS v6.3 was Chrome ate up lots of CPU+RAM to show the pinned and not suspended tabs, then it was done. No TGS hogging other than few seconds on startup.\nI've tried install other versions of TGS from Github, but they install under a different extension id, so I can't easily hijack the chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html. If only I knew of some way to open the Session Buddy database and change \"klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg\" to whatever I need, then restart Chrome... Hard to test the beta version on Github without manually opening 1800 new tabs. By hand.\nAnyways, tried enable/disable the new settings in TGS v7. No change. If I should throw out a guess about what I think maybe might eating up CPU and RAM I'd say the new session system in v7, but that's the standard blaming the new guy. My thought was maybe instead of adding/removing a tab to the session it rather scans ALL tabs whenever one change happens, then saves the list. The reason I'm thinking about this is because Chrome did something similar before they fixed it 1+ year ago. Before I found Session Buddy I went into Chrome settings 1-2 times a week and saved the tabs with the third option of what to restore on startup. Before the fix it would take Chrome half a minute to store 300 tabs, after the fix it was less than a second.\nWish I had better programming skills so I could help out searching for the hogs.. Using Chrome 71.0.3578.98\nDownloaded zip with TGS v7.0.158 including commits:\n247fb7ae2b7be8666b467bf5abf8b5f44b9db0ce\nb64e79c1f652bbb4e0f0df1d831ca899fee1614d\nRestarted Chrome to force a new Session Buddy session. Then resetted the flags used in https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/793#issuecomment-430601077\nRestarted Chome again for flags to take effect. Manually installed the extension, went to the about page and waited for it to load. Scanning all tabs took 40 sec for 1 window with 1948 tabs.\nEvery time I start Chrome there are always some TGS tabs that don't load properly and fall back to showing default TGS icon on the tab instead of the website's icon. Those tabs reload normally when I focus them. But now that I just restarted Chrome and didn't give those tabs any focus, just went into TGS:about and let it scan all the tabs, it showed this for normal loaded tabs:\n3894 | 3899 | 4 | [tab name] | - | pinned\nAnd this for faulted tabs:\n3894 | 3900 | 5 | [tab name] | 20.12.2018, 17:54:56 | unknown\nNote that both are pinned in Chrome, but that doesn't show up here.\nSo I gave all those faulted pinned tab some focus and went on to the debug page again. 40 seconds later and the faulted tabs showed the same info. Went back and checked all those tabs that got status=unknown and saw they all had not been loaded by Chrome. That included pinned tabs not suspended by TGS and suspended pinned tabs.\nClosed the debug page, opened it again, waited 40 sec. Now those tabs I had to give focus for Chrome to load are correctly marked as status=pinned, although none show any hints that they are suspended by TGS and would have the\nURL=chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=TweetDeck&pos=0&uri=https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/\nBut moving forward. Clicked \"claim all suspended tabs\". Saw the suspended tabs from left to right got refreshed. Went to watch some TV to give it enough time to complete.\nWeird. Vivaldi (which I'm typing this in) crashed after I had watched TV for about 30 mins. Brought with it monitordriver or similar. Never done that before. Chrome is not responsive. CPU usage is normal, Chrome isn't among the top 10. RAM usage on the other hand is through the roof. All 16GB are consumed by Chrome (normally I have 4-8GB \"free\", depending on not-yet-suspended-tabs). Guess that's why Vivaldi and monitordriver crashed.\nI'm gonna restart the PC, open Chrome and let it sit for a while again. BRB.. Forgot to disable TGS v7.0.109 after I had claimed all suspended tabs. Did that now and restarted Chrome. Back to the TV and wait.. Chrome is stable after that 1h AFK. RAM-usage is normal. CPU-usage is better than what it was, maybe better than it has ever been for Chrome.\nGonna see how it handles Tweetdeck and the addition of several new tabs. Tweetvideos are still lagging a bit every few seconds, but not sure if it's because of TGS or Chrome itself. Opening new websites in new tabs and the aftermath of that is consuming more CPU than with TGS v7.0.109 + Chrome flags https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/793#issuecomment-430601077 . Seems to be fine when everything has settled down.\nClosing Chrome is rather quick now. Opening Chrome with 50 pinned tabs where half are not suspended always takes a minute for everything to load and get done. Still not completely done after a minute, but acceptable. Not that superlaggy every 5 sec as it used to be, just generally busy.  And as I saw earlier it was just fine after that 1h TV AFK.\nWeird... TGS is not on the rightclickmenu after that restart. I used it to suspend Tweetdeck before the restart. It's enabled in the options. Disabled then enabled made it show up again.\nOk, so the conclusion so far is that it's much better but still consumes lots of CPU the \"minutes\" after Chrome is opened and when new tabs with content are opened. It does settle down after a while, just not fast enough compared to how it was with TGS v6.3\n@deanoemcke Let me know if you have a new build you wanna test or something specific tested in this build.. With TGS v6.3 before I formatted the PC, when I opened new tabs it was as if I did so with an empty Chrome with no addons. CPU-usage when pages loaded, then done. Now (and yes, a couple of Chrome versions later) the pages consume CPU for much longer time, meaning tabs end up stacking CPU-usage instead of running in serial.\nWith TGS v7.0.158 disabled (and all the suspended tabs were automatically closed by that action): Did my normal thing with tweetdeck. Opened 10 tabs and watched a twittervideo while they loaded. No lag or any disruption on the video. Did all this again while I watched resourcemonitor for CPU-usage: as expected and dropped immediately after the pages were done loading. With TGS v7.0.158 the CPU-usage have the same pattern, but stretched longer in time, and the tail is much longer (same as the experience is that it \"never\" gets done loading new tabs/pages).. Not sure if I've had the shift-arrow icon on the shift button on the previous several keyboards. First time I saw a suspended tab for TGS I had to think a bit about what it meant. Guess it's been a while.\nIs it possible to put a rectangle or button around each of them for Windows? [ctrl][shift][s]. ",

There is some kind of dependence on URL, some pages are suspended perfectly. but when compared to the previous version, something has definitely changed.\n\n. @Jollfye \nonly if this code appeared after version 160. but this does not refute the fact that through the extension menu the tab does not remember command will suspend.. code, programmer code. talked about by @deanoemcke \n\nThere is some code to say that if this tab has never been suspended before, then it MUST wait for the tab to finish loading before suspending,\n\n. @deanoemcke \nAll pages for both versions were new and did not load earlier.\ndownload was less than 60 seconds.\nI confirm that re-opening a tab immediately suspends it (v165)\nbut I still do not understand why version 160 is not waiting for the end of the page loading.\n\n. @deanoemcke \nthx for the explanation. sorry for the long answer\nlog.txt\nAt first I tried to use the extension menu, then the context menu.\n. @deanoemcke now everything is fine!\ncould you explain to me once again about the never loaded pages?\nConcerning the function \"screen capture\", everything is clear, it needs to see the whole page.\nBut if I just want to put a tab to suspend, why should I wait for the download to end? I can always forcibly stop the download and everything seems to be okay?\nI think I remember cases when, instead of the title of the page, I saw a URL.\nShould I wait for the page to load to avoid this?. 157 line.

Or can they be changed via chrome or the operating system?\n@deanoemcke In other words, should we use symbols that are not present in all Cyrillic fonts?\n\n. in fact, the whole question comes down to one letter \"\u0451\", and its use. in the browser, the opera (when writing options) does not use \"\u0451\", replacing it with a similar \"\u0435\". in vivaldi - use. chrome when using search (ctrl + f) considers these letters to be the same. I can not say for sure that this letter will be in all standard fonts of different OS (especially if this extension works on Linux) and browsers.\nIn russian documentation and literature, they often do not use the letter \"\u0451\", but from the point of view of grammar dictionaries, it is necessary. but increasingly, the use of this letter is not considered an error. personally my opinion, in technical literature and its manifestations, ignoring this letter will insure against possible errors in displaying the font.. it seems everything is ready, I think we are ready for a merger.. if it\u2019s not easy to implement, then it\u2019s probably worth thinking about the need, otherwise I think that everything that doesn\u2019t impair the functionality has the right to life.\nmy extensions will never be in the same language, many extensions do not have the russian language or have only english.\nSome extensions that have rus lang I use quite rarely, and I would not want to switch them along with the entire browser to english.\nIn addition, the russian version of TGS was rather frightening, but now the translation should improve.\nthe first time I saw a familiar menu in russian ... it took some getting used to.\nI agree that this \u201cinnovation\u201d cannot be attributed to improvement, it just adds a little bit of freedom.. @deanoemcke \nthe blank/white suspended tab - rarer problem.\nv165\nwhen closing the browser - a bug in place. 3 of 5 windows received broken icons (counts tab 3-50)\nif chrome is not closed - everything seems ok. I always work with several windows to not keep 100+ tabs open in one winow. so I just need TGS. when I had 4GB of RAM, chrome itself was doing it, but now I have 16GB and chrome happily loads the processor by 101% when opened without an TGS.\nThe only option to close chrome with multiple windows is to close all windows in turn.\nso to return them after closing the chrome, I use ctrl + shift + t. unless of course i use the session manager, but this is not convenient.\nI tried to use ctrl + shift + t after the full load of the first window, then everything seems fine with the other windows.. At the moment, in the current version of TGS (not from the Google store), the problem of icons has been solved. bad icons can be obtained, only in one case, which I described above, this is due to the principle of loading extensions.\nfor a long time, I use ctrl + shift + t after waiting for a browser load and not getting \"bad icons\".. I have not the latest browser versions.\nVivaldi 1.14.1077.55 - I can select several tabs and open the context menu\nOpera 52.0.2871.40 - works like chrome. I came after the party ended, but I am pleased with the way she went ^_^. on mac definitely looks better. On windows, the arrow does not look like the classic arrow Shift. more reminds me \"up\" key.\nI don't know why I have such a gap, but he was always there.. \nlooks nice. If you do not use \"+\", then \"dot\" is the best option.. that's all I wanted to fix. @Jollfye yes. @Jollfye hi.\nplease explain to me, I don\u2019t quite understand why this button has been added. \n\"\u0422\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a\" button will now always be there in public versions?. @Jollfye I'm understood, thank you. The translation looks good.. I do not know why there are these symbols here, in the original there is none. where can i see this message live? maybe you can give me a screenshot?\n\n. about the work of tab-discarding. Does it start to work when I put a tab to sleep? or does it work anytime for a tab that sleeps? \np.s. By sleep, I mean suspend. I did not quite understand it. where can i see this message live? maybe you can give me a screenshot?\n\n. the word \"backup\" is made to mean manual copying or using session management? where can i see this message live? maybe you can give me a screenshot?. \n\"plain text\" does this mean text without markup?\nin the session export file, I only see the URL addresses. \nI was also unable to retrieve this message, even when I placed two addresses in one line. these tabs just disappeared during import. line 78. \nit can be translated as\n\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432 Chrome \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438\nor\n\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432 Chrome \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a\nHowever, in practice, I see a delay in rendering only for non-suspend tabs.. okay, I corrected, only the preview above is \"outdated\". fixed\np.s. oh yeah, i forgot to do it. if it works with all tabs, as I can see, then\n\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432 Chrome \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438\nthen need to rewrite the entire description of the tab-discarding. however, the original is specifically mentioned \"Reduces a suspended tab's memory usage\". due to the specificity of the term and the target audience of this text, can even use \"\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043f\u0435\u0440\"\nhttps://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80. in my translation\n\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438\nwhy do i see above\n\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438\n?. previous translation again.

The behavior is now continuing beyond just start-up, even the previously suspended tabs are loading as suspended.\nI am using the latest ChromeOS, and have 7 windows with about 300 tabs loaded (most suspended of course).. It looks like there might be pathological issue when the extension approaches 300 tabs? I killed the extension, and after trimming things from 303 tabs in 7 windows down to 253 tabs in 4 windows, after a bit of spinning around 70% CPU when restarting the extension it settled to 1-4% CPU and 300 Mb... which is the behavior I am used to.

This is because unless I forcefully reload each one on startup, it won't set the proper favicon (it will use the default extension icon by default).\nHave you considered checking for icons in Chrome's existing cache? Is there a way to reuse a fetched favicon for multiple tabs? Many of my tabs are from the same site, but hitting the server a few dozen times to fetch the same resource would be unnecessary. Another, potentially heavy-handed approach:  I've noticed several other extensions store data in the bookmarks.

The issue appears could be with Chrome now bringing to the front the window where active tab has just changed, so if a tab gets suspended then another, non-suspended one from the same window receives focus and Chrome forcefully brings the whole thing to foreground. This focus stealing is evidently not a graceful behavior since it is intrusive and goes contrary the established custom of flashing the taskbar entry for apps that need attention, but instead of hoping it will get rectified in Chrome maybe a workaround could be implemented in TGS that would simply prevent Chrome from switching to a non-suspended tab?. @deanoemcke\nExtension v7.0.109\nChrome  72.0.3626.109 /64 bit\nPlease watch the attached video I made to reproduce this bug per your request. \nIn the video I have two windows.

I then unsuspend this tab, switch to another tab in same window and then go back to another window with my mouse.

If I open two windows, open 10 tabs on each, then randomly click around hold mouse down, scrolling, scroll over in the background window without focusing it, clicking in the focus one, this bug happens more often and I can reproduce it maybe with 80%.. No, I am on Windows 10. Version 72.0.3626.121 (Official Build) (64-bit). And yes, it IS a nightmare.. No... I have this issue since months. Maybe a change from 70 to 71 or 71 to 72.. Yes that seems to match.. Nice that it was fixable via a workaround. I guess Chrome wont change or revert it, because of security reasons. If a script reloads a page I guess the devs want the user see it, could be a malicious script for example in the background.\nWhen will this be avaibale in the Chrome store? I guess it will take weeks? Is there a build version I can download?. What testing? I thought this was fixed. Why is there no build on https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/releases ?. ",
    "noctarius": "I have the exact same issue, however only when I'm using my Mac. My Windows Desktop doesn't seem to issue. From the past I remember that changes might hit different OS' at different times, so maybe the Windows version is not yet affected.\nOn OSX it even seems to steal focus from other applications, switching back to Chrome. If you think tab switching sucks, this is a freaking nightmare :D . Interesting, my Windows Desktop is still on 72.0.3626.119 (and it doesn't seem to have this weird behavior), whereas my OSX Chrome is on  72.0.3626.121.\nIt sounds like it was a recent change from 119 to 121.. PS: Looking at the Chrome git repository, I see some change related to \"popup at unload\". Unloading sounds like something TGS would do on suspending a tab: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/bb2f12167701f588f92621abf86ea4c11e70c9d5%5E%21/#F1\nmaybe it is related somehow. @makedir mh ok, the actual change regarding popups on unload was added on Nov 2018, does that about match up with your feeling of \"since months\"?\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/third_party/+/1ce8cace106443751862cb14efb940fa64d7bf5d%5E%21/#F5. @deanoemcke my guess is, that the new CreateWindowDelegate function, which unfortunately is virtual - so no idea how many implementations exist, is the issue. Probably, at least, one wrapper implementation behaves weird. But well, just my guess :). I'm on it, trying it right away. I see you removed the history manipulation, even though it would fix it, too me this is only a temp workaround and still a bug in the newer versions of chrome ;)\nedit: @deanoemcke  alright, tried it and yeah that seems to work around the actual issue - so yeah fixed. Please create a version, at the same time we should try to file an issue with the Chrome team, except you'd say \"ah f... it, this functionality isn't important at all\" :D. Fair enough, but I think it's definitely a NO-GO to capture foreground focus for an application which is in the background and put itself in the foreground. Anyways, thanks for fixing it so fast :). @makedir, you can clone the repository and tell chrome to load the src subdirectory (I think dev mode must be activated in the extensions page first). This will load it as a local extension. Make sure to disable the original version until it is fixed.\nMaking a new version available is generally a thing of a few minutes, but depending on the changes that are in the master repository some testing might be necessary before pushing it . Testing of other stuff that is in master. As you see under releases \"pre-7.1 beta\" ;) Give him a day or two or whatever he needs. Never forget, we're all just doing that kind of stuff in our free time, I'm just lucky to (at least partly) be paid for open source stuff :). ",

    "shkey": "@deanoemcke To be honest, I have made tremendous changes, most of which are basic vocabulary rather than sentence meanings. Although, I can't make the promise that my version is perfect, it's still the most suitable \"Simplified Chinese Translation\". As for it's correctness, I may promise you. Then, I would like to say something about the \"Traditional Chinese Translation\". I believe that I'm not qualified to make such comments for I'm not familiar with it. However, I may make an emphasis on the fact that both \"SCT\" and \"TCT\" have their own way of translation. \"Tab\", for example, we may translate it into \"\u6807\u7b7e\u9875\" in \"SCT\" while we can call it \"\u5206\u9875\" in \"TCT\". To draw a conclusion, one size doesn't fit all. Habitual differences always occur in these two kinds of translations. And, if you want to make sure whether the current \"TCT\" is right or not, you'd better find a local person.. @deanoemcke It's my pleasure.

    "yanamal": "\nAre you using the web store version (as opposed to loading it via a local copy of the code)?\n\nWeb store version.\n\nIf yes: did the previous version have a different design (v6.x)? Or similar to what you have now (v7.x)?\n\nI believe it already had a similar design; but I may be confusing it with my other computer, which may have updated earlier w/o triggering the same issue (as below). It seems like if it were v7.x, it wouldn't have triggered a surprise update.\n\nUnfortunately, if during the update a whole window gets closed (because every single tab in that window was suspended) then when the window is recreated, it may well be in a different desktop and with different window dimensions.\n\nYes, that is probably exactly what happened. A few windows with a single unsuspended tab remained where they were, the rest relocated to the currently-active space. It's quite surprising to me that the windows have to have different behavior if all tabs in them are suspended (which is to say, that the update can be performed \"in-place\" on suspended tabs without reloading the whole window, but only if there is at least one unaffected/unsuspended tab in the window)\n\nA workaround to protect yourself from this happening it to ensure that there is always at least 1 tab unsuspended in each window. The easiest way to achieve this is to make sure the option 'Never suspend active tab in each window' option is checked, and to ensure you never leave the window open on a suspended tab (otherwise the now non-active one will also suspend).\n\nI actually do have the 'never suspend active tab' option on, but I also manually suspended the active tabs in a lot of windows because I knew I wasn't going to come back to them any time soon, and (again) I never suspected that the behavior of a window full of suspended tabs would at any point be different than the behavior of a window with mixed suspended/unsuspended tabs.\n\nYou can also submit a feature request for this, there may be something I can do in future to ensure that at least one tab is unsuspended before performing the update.\n\nOK, will do.\n\nAlso to clarify one other thing. Are you saying that all your tabs got restore in an UNsuspended state? This should not have been the case, they should all reappear, but in their original suspended state. This makes the recovery of all the tabs much faster. Although it can still cause some significant CPU usage for a while.\n\nNo, the suspension state was exactly as before. The CPU/memory usage was just from Chrome doing something to all the tabs all at the same time. \n. ",
