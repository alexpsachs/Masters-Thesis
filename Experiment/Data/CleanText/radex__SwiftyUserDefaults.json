    "radex": "Looks good! Thanks @jklausa @getaaron \n. Great stuff! \ud83c\udf89 Thanks @maximkhatskevich!\n. FYI @maximkhatskevich I'm still recommending to just copy the project's file to your project over CocoaPods because: a) Swift support in CocoaPods isn't shipped yet, and b) it won't work on iOS 7 AFAIK.\n. This is a consequence of how objectForKey works. Integers, doubles and booleans are all encoded as NSNumber. There is no API to check for user defaults type (it is held somewhere, as you can see by trying defaults read-type ..., but it's not exposed to NSUserDefaults).\nSo, 100 == true, and 0 == false, because that's what NSNumber does.\nDo you think it's a good idea to make \"true\", \"false\", \"1\", \"0\" convertible to bool? How does boolForKey react to those values?\n. Does it work reliably though? The last time I looked into this, NSNumber did not promise (at all) that the representation of booleans would be explicitly as booleans. It just thought it's the same as ints\u2026\n. Hm. It's super annoying, though, because internally, defaults does store the type \u2014 it's just that NSNumber doesn't, and AFAIK there's no API to check for key's type :( \n. With http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/ and the next branch, I'd rather have people define the defaults keys they want to use statically, explicitly stating the type they want to use, and not rely on dynamic casting behavior. So this doesn't matter much anymore.\n. Thanks @picciano, but this is too magic and implicit for my taste. I share your dislike for the inconsistency (with bool/int/double), but I don't think this is the solution.\n. Thanks @narfdotpl!\nAny specific reason why you wrote .map { $0 as! NSObject } instead of as! NSObject? or as? NSObject?\n. Right. .map { $0 as! NSObject }, AFAICT, has the exact same behavior as as! NSObject?. It could crash if the cast failed, but it won't fail ;)\nI liked as NSObject?, but now that the exclamation mark is shouting \"DANGER\" at me, I think as? NSObject is best here.\n. Looks great. Thank you @narfdotpl! \u2728\ud83c\udf89\n. Type pod --version in your command line. It should say something like \"0.36.0.beta1\". If it says \"0.35.0\", you have an old version of CocoaPods that doesn't support Swift pods.\n. That's odd. I'm sorry, but I don't know how to help :( \n. Have you tried other Swift-based pods? Does the same issue occur? Try looking for or asking about this on Stack Overflow\u2026\n. Not sure why you'd prefer to check for nil instead of using hasKey, but try this:\nDefaults[\"firstInstallDate\"].object == nil\nThe subscript itself always returns a NSUserDefaults.Proxy, so it will never be nil.\n. Very interesting! Thanks @phimage. Not sure I understand, though, what's the benefit of writing Defaults[\"foo\"][\"bar\"] over Defaults[\"foo.bar\"]?\n. I don't understand why prefix your defaults with something like a bundle name? I mean, the standardUserDefaults are already scoped to your app only.\n. Hm. That's a fair point, though I would say it's the 3rd party frameworks' responsibility to prefix the stuff they save in my user defaults\u2026\nLet me think about this\u2026\n. You're right! I'll merge it in later today :)\n. Alright, done! I merged to master and cut a new release: 1.1.0. I haven't tested it with CocoaPods but it should work just fine.\nThanks for the reminded @jschmid!\nPS. \"later today\", LOL.\n. I appologize for not replying before. I couldn't reproduce your problem.\nCould you try it again with CocoaPods 0.37.1?\n. Great, glad to hear that!\n. Carthage support would be great, but I'm not familiar with the system myself\u2026 I'd definitely be willing to merge it in if someone prepared a pull request.\n. Added by @alec-c4 via #14 :)\n. Apologies to have kept you waiting. I'll do my best to properly test your code in the weekend (I don't have experience with Carthage) and unless there's some issue, I'll merge it in :)\n. Hey @alec-c4 . I haven't forgot about it, I'm just terribly, embarrassingly bad at side projects and keeping commitments related to them.\nI took a look at your changes, played with Carthage, and it all looks great. Thank you for your work and sorry I kept you waiting so long.\n. I'm not familiar with using NSKeyedArchiver with NSUserDefaults \u2014 I'm not sure if it's a common pattern or not.\nIf it is, I'd be definitely happy to add a pair of helpers for writing/accessing archived objects to the user defaults.\nIf anyone is interested in this feature, please give your feedback below \u263a\ufe0f\n. Cool. @pellekrogholt @tbaranes @katopz any specific suggestions as for the API you'd like to see for (de)serializing NSObjects?\n. @katopz @pellekrogholt @tbaranes Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I think I have a pretty great solution on the next branch. Check out http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/ for more background and explanation. Let me know what you think!\n. Thanks @rad3ks, but #14 already added Carthage support (it just took me a while to get it merged).\nCould you elaborate about why XCTAssert is better than assert? I mean, I know the latter doesn't integrate with Xcode, but for the purposes of this project, it works fine. What do you mean about running for \"each platform individually\"?\n. No, the only issue is println in the test target. \n. Still, surprising we didn't need any changes really in this library :)\n. Sorry, I forgot to push a new release. Should work now.\n(FWIW, the new tag only introduces Carthage support, so v1.1 is functionally the same)\n. That does look useful. Not sure about NSDate() since it represents the current, not \"empty\" date, but 0, [], [:], \"\", etc. often do make sense.\n. Still don't know about this\u2026 Is 1970 a natural, obvious \"null value\" that we want people to use, implicitly?\n. Hm, I'll think about this.\nNot merging this PR just yet, but I will ;)\n. Merged. Thanks.\nI removed objectValue and dateValue before merging. I'm not convinced of the usefulness of their default value behavior. I'd rather people do this explicitly.\n(If people complain about this and make a convincing argument for it, I'll put it back.)\n. Thanks. I'll take a look at this in spare time.\n. Thanks for the pull request, Xavi.\nTwo notes:\n1. I wish you hadn't reordered tests the way you did. Grouping them by SwiftyUserDefaults' function makes more sense than grouping them by a user default type.\n2. Clearing of the user defaults was done in setUp on purpose. Yes, it's good to clean up after yourself, but we don't want garbage from previous tests interfering with our tests. So it should definitely be done before tests.\n. No specific reason as far as I can remember. \n. Thanks @kaunteya. I intend to merge this, but I'm going to hold off until a 2.0 release, since changing the return types might break things.\n. Thanks again. Sorry for not responding for so long. I originally merged those changes to next, but the end, I don't think I want to change it. The reason why is because I think the new approach in the next (2.0) branch is much better (give this a read for more info: http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/) and I want to promote that instead. I'm going to treat the Proxy-based API as legacy, probably deprecate it eventually, and so I'd rather just not change anything.\n. Thanks! Glad you like it. \n. Oops, thanks. \n. Thank you! I merged your changes into the next branch here: https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/commit/d2b749109ae47404e678144a74d31194bfedd5a5\n. Thanks @kohtenko, but the ++ and += operators in SwiftyUserDefaults have really confusing and potentially dangerous semantics. I don't like them anymore.\nCheck out http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/ and the next branch. Swift's -- and -= just work out of the box with the new approach.\n. Please be more specific. Why do you want to override the Proxy class? Real world examples, please. \n. I'm going to close this now. Let me know if you have a good argument for making it public.\n. Thanks for the PR. Having URL support would certainly make sense.\nCan you elaborate on the ?= problem you're describing? ?= shouldn't be used with nil \u2014 it just doesn't make sense to assign a nil to something when it's nil\u2026\n. That sounds like a Swift bug. Have you filed a radar?\n. Okay, thanks for letting me know. I'll think about it. I just don't want to make it look like you're supposed to pass an optional to ?= \u2014 you're not.\n. I added NSURL support on the next branch. Thanks again!\n. You must be using the old version of the library\n. It should be 1.3.0\n. Have you tried running pod update?\n. Thank you! I merged that into the next branch \u2014 can you verify it works?\n. This is NSUserDefaults concern \u2014 SwiftyUserDefaults is just a wrapper around this. Hopefully, people are now dropping support for iOS 7 ahead of iOS 9 and this won't matter anymore. Thanks.\n. Done on the next branch. Thanks!\n. Hey @IdoBn, thanks for this, check out the next branch for Swift 2 compatibility and some cool new stuff :)\n. That's what I get for changing things in the last minute. Thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. That would be more confusing than helpful. \"Right now\" is not an obvious, universally-correct default value for a date. I'd rather have you use ?? NSDate() explicitly if that's what you want.\n. 0 is \"empty\", false is empty, \"\" is empty\u2026 \"right now\" isn't empty.\n. Exactly the kind of thing I'm worried about. Seems faaaaar less likely to do such a mistake with default values for other types. \n. What a perfect piece of evidence that accidental NSDate/NSData typos happen ;)\n. Thanks @jschmid!\n. I guess the way I'd do it is:\nfor (key, _) in Defaults.dictionaryRepresentation() {\n            Defaults.removeObjectForKey(key)\n}\nbut yeah, it wouldn't be too bad to have a shortcut for that in SwiftyUserDefaults.\n. I added Defaults.removeAll() in 1ac8701. Hope this solves it.\n. no, that's a mistake\u2026 Should support 10.9 and up\u2026\n. Soon. I want to ship the 2.0 tonight. \n. Fixed, thanks for letting me know about this!\n. I did mention it in the post. Subscripts don't support generic constraints in Swift 2. Which makes me very sad. (But from API consumer point of view, I still like this better than the alternative)\n. Also a cool approach, but I like SUD's syntax better, and some of the semantics and safety with getting/setting ;)\n. Do it and I'll merge it ;)\n. @staticdreams that'd be great \u2014 if you don't mind making a PR, I'll merge it :) \n. Thanks @Antoine4011 @mathiasnagler! I'm closing this PR as #53 is newer :) \n. Thanks!\n. A few reasons:\n1. Syntax. I like the dictionary-like feel of Defaults[.prop] vs Defaults.prop.value.\n2. And it's a little bit shorter\n3. And that it feels like it makes a bit more sense with you subscripting a collection, not calling \"value\" on the key itself\n4. If you're not using the standard user defaults, but some other NSUserDefaults (e.g. shared defaults in an app group), you can just subscript a different defaults object \u2014 the key object only describes the key, not the collection\nYeah, it's kind of an implementation PITA, but I'm not concerned with that in this project \u2014 it's not an approach I would usually take, but I slightly prefer this approach to what you're suggesting. I'm cool with magic.\n. This is a problem with the underlying Apple framework, not my code.\nThe synchronize stuff only matters in iOS 7. You're not supposed to use it in later versions. \n. It should be. \n. It doesn't. Do it yourself if you need to support iOS 7. Otherwise, do nothing. \n. Why do you want to use Float and not Double?\n. Hm. Lack of support for floats was a deliberate decision -- Swift strongly recommends just using Double everywhere. The fact that UISlider reports Float -- I consider that an interop limitation. \n. Nope. Swift encourages people to just use Int and Double. Float is great when you need the efficiency \u2014 that is, when you have significant arrays of them (SCNVector3 is probably a good use case, I think). Otherwise, it just doesn't matter.\n. I don't want to teach people bad habits. It's not difficult to cast to/from Double :) . > ld: warning: directory not found for option '-F/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS9.1.sdk/Developer/Library/Frameworks'\n@mrahmiao do you still have this problem? The other warnings are working as designed.\n. Ah, nevermind, I see the same warning. Not sure what's the cause but I'll accept a fix.\n. @ton03 I'll accept a patch.\n. @ton03 I no longer reproduce any warnings except for deprecation warnings (working as intended) while updating with carthage. I'm closing this issue, but let me know if you can still see the problem.\n. > This code which is recommended does not autocomplete:\nOh well. Xcode\u2014Swift integration is not yet as good as I'd like it to be. This sort of thing generally auto-completes (with enum cases and all), but apparently not here. (Not yet, anyway)\n\nObviously there is a bad design decision on the name. Please change it so it is clear what Keys and Key does.\n\nThe only purpose for both classes existing is to work around compiler limitations. Explained here: http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/\n\nThis works and autocompletes:\nvar userDefault = Defaults[DefaultsKeys.userId]\nBut, this does not work:\n\nWorks for me \u2014 what's the DefaultsKeys.userId implementation?\n\nMaybe some shortcut like:\nvar userDefault = Defaults[Defs.userId]\nmight be useful\n\nGo ahead, define a Defs struct \u2014 also an approach I'm cool with (again: http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/). There's nothing magical about DefaultsKeys except for the fact that it allows for the shortcut .foo. If you don't like the dot-shortcut syntax because it doesn't play well with autocompletion, you don't have to use it.\n. Having statically-defined default values would be very nice indeed. I need to consider more closely if there's a nice way to achieve that given current Swift limitations (no generic subscripts, no extending generic types, etc...)\nCould you explain this bit?\nDefaultsKey<String, UIColor>([\"color\": UIColor.grayColor()])\nWhy does it have two type params and a dictionary \u2014 I don't get it?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @mathiasnagler!\n. That was quick, thanks!\n. Extend DefaultsKeys, not DefaultsKey -- the whole purpose of the former is to work around this compiler limitation\n. Thanks :)\n. @staticdreams Apologies for not doing it months ago. I've just released v2.1.0\n. Awesome work!\nOne thing annoys me, API design-wise: so far, we used optionals in the type parameter String vs String? to convey whether a key should be returned as optional or with a default value.\nAdding custom default values makes this possibly confusing a bit, because it doesn't make any sense to have a T? defaults key with a custom default value defined.\nI want to think of ways to clarify this if possible and disallow the behavior that doesn't make any sense.\nIdeas? Discussion welcome.\n. I would do a quick crash, as this should just be illegal (IMHO). Would be best to have this checked at compile-time, but I'm not sure what's the best approach. Don't like the idea of subclassing DefaultsKey much.\n. Hm, is there no way to do this without defining a new protocol?\nAlso: you should use precondition()\n. Agree, it makes sense. I would call the protocol OptionalType, for consistency with other protocol names. (Not that it makes a huge difference \u2014\u00a0it's private anyway).\nAlso, what I meant by using precondition was to drop the guard altogether:\nprecondition(!(defaultValue is OptionalType), \"Failure message\")\n. Yes, a more versatile solution would be great \n. Alright all:\n1. I would be happy to add support for easy serialization of RawRepresentable values. Indeed, this would be great for enums\n2. I would also be cool with adding a protocol like SwiftyUserDefaultsSerializable for (un)archiving of any custom, Swift-only type. (Unless someone has a better idea of how to solve it).\nPR-s are very welcome.\n. @staticdreams Yes, but not directly. If your enum is RawRepresentable, you can store the underlying value via .rawValue, then recreate it when reading using init?(rawValue:).\nYou can quite easily extend NSUserDefaults to add a subscript for DefaultsKey<YourEnumType> that does this behind the scenes for you.\nThis should be simpler.\n. \u2705 Added easy RawRepresentable support in SwiftyUserDefaults 2.2\nStill no SwiftyUserDefaultsSerializable, because then you have to write both an NSUserDefaults extension and an extension on your own type. Until we can get the proper subscripts automatically (maybe Swift 3), it's not really much better\u2026 I could, however, document how to add support for completely custom types\u2026\n. > I guess the other warnings are not meant to be resolved?\nIf they're coming from my code then no.\n. Thanks \u2014 I hope this actually compiles ;)\n. This is a cool idea, but out of scope for this library.\n. Yeah, that should be simpler, but swift compiler limitations don't allow me. \n. Thank you.\n. @ajaysinghthakur Please use Stack Overflow in the future, as this isn't an appropriate place to ask this kind of questions.\n@ed-mejia is right, this code will work:\nswift\nfor (key, _) in Defaults.dictionaryRepresentation() {\n     Defaults.removeObjectForKey(key)\n }\n. @ajaysinghthakur there is a tag: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/swiftyuserdefaults\n. > I just got that error too. I assume the library doesn't support multidimensional arrays?\nNo, it doesn't. Until Swift becomes more powerful, you can only define and use DefaultsKey on one of the supported types. You can, however, quite easily extend NSUserDefaults and add support for a given DefaultsKey type.\n. @toshi0383 Very cool! I understand this works regardless of whether or not SwiftyUserDefaults is used? i.e. if someone sets a value using plain old NSUserDefaults API, this will still work?\n. Thanks \u2014 I'll review it more closely when I have more time, but could you explain to me the design of this code in the meantime? Like, why are there three observe* methods, what's the purpose of BlockDisposable and RecursiveLock?\n. Beginning iOS 9.3, you can actually observe changes made to your user defaults from outside the app:\nhttps://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/711972673367052288\nVery cool.\n. Nice. The problem is \u2014 why should [[Bool]] be the special exception?\nUntil we can express automatic support for any reasonable key type in Swift, I suggest:\n- we drop the [[Bool]] support\n- we add getTwoDimensionalArray a user can use\n- add a note to README as for how to add support for additional types like this.\nI would be happy to merge that.\nAnd if you were inclined to also add support for arbitrary dictionaries the same way (only [String: AnyObject] is supported out of the box), that would be awesome.\n. > We should be able to have automatic support for the common keys, I am not sure how that will work.\nNot possible without generic subscripts.\n. No, this really doesn't work. https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-115 tracks this issue. \n. @MaxHasADHD I don't understand what you're trying to say \u2014 can you elaborate?\n. OK, got it. #59 was proposing an alternative to using registerDefaults, instead, embedding the default value in the DefaultsKey definition.\nThe latter definitely seems cleaner, but registerDefaults has the advantage of working across NSUserDefaults, whether or not you actually use SwiftyUserDefaults and those key values.\n. Please do not store sensitive data in user defaults. It's not meant for it, and it's unsafe to do so.\nI have no plans for encryption. SwiftyUserDefaults is a Swifty API for NSUserDefaults, nothing more.\n. I'm not really comfortable extending the Proxy getters, because I think the way to go forward is to use statically-typed keys instead of the old stringly-typed API...\nI think I can merge it anyway, but please open a pull request.\n. Done thanks to valentinknabel.\n. @BalestraPatrick did the work to prepare travis config, but I still have to set it up on my end.\n. boom, works! Thanks again, @BalestraPatrick!\n. Awesome, thank you Patrick!\n. Thank you!\n.

IT WORKS :D Thank you @valentinknabel.\n. Thanks.\n. Let me know if I need to cut a new version for this to work automatically \u2014 I don't know much about Carthage.\n. Okay, I think https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/pull/77 fixes just this issue \u2014 can you verify it? I think I have to cut a new release tag.\n. Regarding deprecations: people still use those. I would have to cut a 3.0 to remove them. I could also lose the warnings if I removed tests for them, but hey, again, people still use them. I wish I could silence Swift deprecation warnings, but I don't think I can. (the deprecations, after all, are meant for the users, not my test target)\n. OK, I just pushed 2.1.3 with the fix and also found a way to suppress deprecation warnings. Let me know if there's still a problem.\n. One way is to just define in your app:\nvar SomeOtherDefaults = NSUserDefaults(...)\nand use that instead of Defaults.\nWould that fix it for you? Or do you need the ability to quickly switch between arbitrary suites?\n. > I think it'd be handy to set global suiteName once, somewhere early (e.g. in AppDelegate):\n\nDefaults.suiteName = \"group.my.appGroup\"\n\nI'd much prefer the declarative version:\nvar Defaults = NSUserDefaults(suiteName: ...)\nThis is cleaner to me, and has the advantage that you can put it in a separate file you can share between targets...\n. >  you may loose data saved to defaults unless you manually call Defaults.synchronize() each time you change something because the system may kill the process suddenly, to the best of my understanding (and in the case of running from Xcode, if you stop the project just at the right time, it won't save either).\nYou could be right, but all I keep hearing (from @Catfish-Man on Twitter, mostly) is that calling synchronize() is simply not necessary.\n. @Catfish-Man Thank you for the info!\n. Ok, so:\n- synchronize seems to be unnecessary save for some very extreme conditions, so I don't see a reason to add it to SUD\n- you can define a var Defaults = NSUserDefaults(suiteName: ...) in your own module to shadow the Defaults shortcut defined by the library.\nI'm closing this for now, but let me know if I missed something from the discussion.\n. Very cool work. I have reservations about this, because using a plist to register defaults means you don't get any type checking by the compiler \u2014 i.e. no way to verify correctness of your registered defaults. For example if you try to rename a default during development, but forget to change your plist, you'll have created a bug.\nI think the approach I would prefer to promote is a statically typed one, like so:\nDefaults.register([\n     .userName: 'radex',\n     .launchCount: 0,\n])\n(The actual implementation and syntax would be trickier, but I think you get the point.)\nWhat do you think about that?\n. > The reason I leaned on the plist is because it's easier to control the defaults when distributing multiple apps, i.e. code stays the same across apps with differences only in the plist.\nGood observation, but you can do the same with Swift, no?\n```\n// UserDefaults.swift\nextension DefaultsKeys {\n     static let userName = DefaultsKey(\"userName\")\n}\nvar Defaults = NSUserDefaults(defaults: [\n     .userName: 'radex',\n])\n```\n. Great, thank you for working on this!\n. > If we're not going to read from plist, then I prefer to set default values in the DefaultKeys extension \nBut this way, the default values won't be visible to non-Swifty NSUserDefaults users. Unless you specifically register those DefaultsKey objects, but at that point it's better to do the whole default registering separately.\n\notherwise a race condition can be introduced\n\ncould you explain?\n. > In this example, viewDidLoad can be called before didFinishLaunchingWithOptions as discussed here. That means the screen will display a blank username, before the defaults are registered.\nWhoa, this is crazy! Thanks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I didn't know it.\nOne idea: make people register their defaults while initializing their Defaults object:\nvar Defaults = NSUserDefaults(defaults: [\n     .userName: 'radex',\n])\nThis ensures defaults registering happens before first Defaults access.\n. So I've been thinking about how to actually implement this statically-typed defaults dictionary.\nNow, we can't actually do it as a dictionary, because we need the requirement for the value to be T matching key's DefaultsKey AND the ability to have key/value pairs of different types. There's no way to express that in Swift.\nYou could do it as tuples, i.e. [ (.userName, \"radex\"), (.launchCount, 0) ], but that would make the array [(DefaultsKeys, Any)], an there's no compile-time type check. Sigh.\nSo I have two concepts that might be possible to implement.\nOne would be a builder DSL:\nregisterDefaults(.userName, \"radex\")\n    .and(.launchCount, 10)\n    .and(.this, that)\nregisterDefaults() would be <T>(DefaultsKey<T>, T), and would return something like DefaultsBuilder, which would have a method and with the same signature.\nAnother option would be something like:\nregisterDefaults([\n    .key(.userName, \"radex\"),\n    .key(.launchCount, 10),\n])\nregisterDefaults would take an array of DefaultsKeyValue (name tbd), which would have a static func key (also looking for a better name) \u2014\u00a0essentially a factory method returning the same type. The method would be <T>(DefaultsKey<T>, T) to type-check the passed stuff.\nNot super in love with either concept. Do you have better ideas?\n. @stephencelis very nice! The second option, with subscripts, doesn't work because I'd have to duplicate all the (non-generic) subscripts. The first option is really nice, though.\n@basememara this is syntactically superior but has two problems:\n- it saves a new value, instead of registering a default\n- static lets are lazily evaluated IIRC, so if someone accesses user defaults outside of DefaultsKey, the default registering won't work. \n. Actually just realized registering defaults in a global var Defaults = ... has the same issue \u2014 it will be evaluated lazily :(\nIdeas? If applicationFinishedLaunching... isn't a good place to do it, then perhaps init is?\n. Nice catch!\n. Hey, thank you for bringing this to my attention. Can you narrow down the memory leak to a test case? I can't think of a legitimate reason a leak could happen in the subscript setter\u2026\nMaybe it's a Swift bug, and when you pass an array to the setter (which gets converted to NSArray), a leak happens there\u2026\nHave you tested on Xcode 7.3?\n. Have you seen the issue since then @goktugyil?. That's so strange. Why would there be array appends? SwiftyUserDefaults doesn't maintain any internal array state\u2026 are you doing any setting of arrays? Perhaps there's something wonky going on during casting when you do that?. Explain rationale?\n. OK, I'm cool with this change, but would you mind adding a /// ... documentation comment to explain the method? A small test case wouldn't hurt either.\n. Thanks!\n. Personally not a fan of observing user defaults, I think generally there are better ways than this. But I'm pretty sure you can do KVO on NSUserDefaults. (Since iOS 9.3, this even works if changes are made outside of your app's process)\n. Sorry, no plans for ObjC support, but you're more than welcome to fork the project or try to re-implement the API in ObjC.\n. yeah, travis isn't configured with Xcode 8 so tests won't pass...\n. > Browsing through the changes, I notice that NSDate and NSData have been changed to Date and Data respectively, which left me wondering if the same should happen to NSArray and NSDictionary for consistency in returning value types?\n\nEdit: Or whether in fact it's more desirable to keep NSDate and NSData for reference types. But I guess that the NS-reference stuff is less swifty?\n\nI want to avoid changing the API of UserDefaults.Proxy because I consider it a legacy API \u2014 and I strongly want to encourage people to use the new, static key-based API. In the latter, it's definitely desirable to change NSDate etc to new types. (But maybe still makes sense to keep the old one as deprecated to ease the transition? Just like I've kept DefaultsKey<NSArray> if it's easier for someone to use that...)\n. btw. thanks everyone for chiming in this discussion! I definitely intend to take a closer look and start an official swift3 branch sometime soon!\n. > I looked at making a single code base that could compile in both environments but I don't think the code complexity would be worth it. Better to just make a hard fork.\nI agree as far as Swift 2/3 compatibility is concerned. The shipping version of SwiftyUserDefaults compiles just fine with Swift 2.3, so people can keep using that for as long as they need. Next version will be Swift 3-only.\nAside from that though, I want to make API transitions in the library itself as smooth as possible. Otherwise people get frustrated, stop updating, and in the end everyone's worse off. That's why there are still things in the codebase marked as \"deprecated\", but not removed completely.\n. > @radex when would you like to new swift 3.0 support branch\nAs soon as possible, sorry, just couldn't find time to do it just yet.\n. Thank you @askari01 for submitting this pull request and everyone for chiming in!\nI merged this PR into swift3 branch: https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/tree/swift3\nI will merge this into master when Swift 3 is out.\nBe sure to submit pull requests if there's any issues on Swift 3, or if the library can be improved with Swift 3 changes! Thanks!\n. For now, feel free to use the branch from https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/pull/91 :) \n. On swift3 branch. Thanks for your patience!\n. Thank you!\n. I converted most of the README to use Swift 3 names and syntax and to account for changes made in #105.\nhttps://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/blob/swift3/README.md\nWould really appreciate if someone took a second close look!\n. No, only deprecated with Defaults[\"foo\"]++. When using static keys, it's fine. Different mechanism.\n. Ah, duh! Thanks.\n. Thanks @arthurhammer \u2014 fixed.\n. #98 fixed this, thanks again to @BalestraPatrick :)\n. This is awesome, thank you!\n. If it fixes it (I don't use Carthage), you should totally open a PR adding SWIFT_VERSION=2.3 to the project file :)\n. Thank you!\n. thanks\n. Ha! Very cool. Shame we can't (not without generic subscripts) make it work more broadly out of the box. This addition might be useful for someone, but they have to know they can use it to implement their own subscript...\nWhat's your motivation to store, say, CGSize, like this? Why not store it as a [\"width\": 10, \"height\": 10]. That's how I imagine I would probably do it\u2026 Simpler, because you only have to deal with one user defaults key...\n. Oops. Done.\n. Happy to accept PRs\n. Done in #106.\n. > @radex Updated to address your comments. It looks like there is a way to check for [Any] == [Any] by doing something like:\n\nXCTAssertEqual(a as NSArray, b as NSArray)\n\nUgh, that's awful :(\n\nIt seems very hacky that we have to go through ObjC classes though. In the meantime, I updated the tests to have more thorough asserts by checking for equality of each members. Let me know if you want me to use the NSArray/NSDictionary cast in tests.\n\nNo, let's stick to your one-by-one checks, at least for now. We'll see how the behavior of [Any] evolves in Swift 3.x\u2026\n. OK, thank you again @ldiqual! If you could just revert the archive/unarchive implementation to what I suggested in the inline comment, I'll merge the PR right away \ud83d\udc4d\n. That's weird...\n. Okay, I went ahead and made the changes myself. Thank you @ldiqual for the great work! And apologies for everyone observing that it took so long.\n. If someone sent a PR for this, I'd be very grateful! \u2764\ufe0f . Started playing with this here: https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/blob/travis-fix/.travis.yml but not sure I can figure it out myself\u2026 \n. I will release it officially when Xcode 8 is out. For now, you'd have to specify SwiftyUserDefaults by pointing to the branch\n. Oh. I'll try to release it tomorrow or the day after that, then.\n. @kylebrowning I'm working on it, but having issues with CocoaPods: https://twitter.com/radexp/status/776191981831778309\n. @kylebrowning @brightsider OK, this should be out now! Can you verify and let me know if this works for you? Thanks!\n. The approach I would recommend is to have a struct type representing your value and then extend UserDefaults with a subscript(key: DefaultsKey<MyStruct>) -> MyStruct that can (de)serialize the struct to a dictionary.\n\nDefaults[.myStoredValue.maxScore]\n\nSadly this syntax is not possible.\n. Thank you @asowers1. Can you explain why this change is needed? Does it not compile, or throw warnings? CocoaPods, Carthage?\n. Thanks for the report!\n. Thanks!\n. @max-potapov done!\n. Hey, the best way for you is to extend UserDefaults and add the right subscript yourself \u2014 it's not difficult.\nThose types are not built in by design \u2014 in 99% cases, one should just use Int and Double.\n. I have no idea what the question is.\n. Oops, typo! Nice catch @DivineDominion. Care to send a quick PR?. @Eitot does it still not work? Have you verified it's a SwiftyUserDefault issue and not an old version of SPM?. Hmm, that sounds like SPM wants to use the Tests/ files but shouldn't\u2026 I don't use SPM myself \u2014 if you could take a look a this an submit a PR that would be \ud83d\udcaf . I'm closing this. @rjcristy if you care to explain the issue, I'll reopen.. Exactly. Thank you @iDurian for the PR, but calling synchronize every time after set is a cargo cult of sorts. David Smith said so himself in some other PR/issue on this repo.. Thanks @DivineDominion !. Thank you! I'll try to take a look at this next week and tag a new version :). I haven't really dealt with NSArchiver before. What's the advantage/use of this over NSCoder?. Why not just save the two values of a CGRect as an array under one key?. Fair enough.. Thank you @humblehacker!. The method already exists, and it's Defaults.synchronize(). Note that it's not recommended to use it in normal circumstances. But if you need to ensure synchronization for testing reasons, there you go. Good stuff, thank you! I will check it out soon :). Thanks!. I don't believe array of enums is compatible with NSCoding. You have to encode by mapping to rawValue, and decode by reinstatiating from rawValue..... Looks good! Thanks @jklausa @getaaron \n. Great stuff! \ud83c\udf89 Thanks @maximkhatskevich!\n. FYI @maximkhatskevich I'm still recommending to just copy the project's file to your project over CocoaPods because: a) Swift support in CocoaPods isn't shipped yet, and b) it won't work on iOS 7 AFAIK.\n. This is a consequence of how objectForKey works. Integers, doubles and booleans are all encoded as NSNumber. There is no API to check for user defaults type (it is held somewhere, as you can see by trying defaults read-type ..., but it's not exposed to NSUserDefaults).\nSo, 100 == true, and 0 == false, because that's what NSNumber does.\nDo you think it's a good idea to make \"true\", \"false\", \"1\", \"0\" convertible to bool? How does boolForKey react to those values?\n. Does it work reliably though? The last time I looked into this, NSNumber did not promise (at all) that the representation of booleans would be explicitly as booleans. It just thought it's the same as ints\u2026\n. Hm. It's super annoying, though, because internally, defaults does store the type \u2014 it's just that NSNumber doesn't, and AFAIK there's no API to check for key's type :( \n. With http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/ and the next branch, I'd rather have people define the defaults keys they want to use statically, explicitly stating the type they want to use, and not rely on dynamic casting behavior. So this doesn't matter much anymore.\n. Thanks @picciano, but this is too magic and implicit for my taste. I share your dislike for the inconsistency (with bool/int/double), but I don't think this is the solution.\n. Thanks @narfdotpl!\nAny specific reason why you wrote .map { $0 as! NSObject } instead of as! NSObject? or as? NSObject?\n. Right. .map { $0 as! NSObject }, AFAICT, has the exact same behavior as as! NSObject?. It could crash if the cast failed, but it won't fail ;)\nI liked as NSObject?, but now that the exclamation mark is shouting \"DANGER\" at me, I think as? NSObject is best here.\n. Looks great. Thank you @narfdotpl! \u2728\ud83c\udf89\n. Type pod --version in your command line. It should say something like \"0.36.0.beta1\". If it says \"0.35.0\", you have an old version of CocoaPods that doesn't support Swift pods.\n. That's odd. I'm sorry, but I don't know how to help :( \n. Have you tried other Swift-based pods? Does the same issue occur? Try looking for or asking about this on Stack Overflow\u2026\n. Not sure why you'd prefer to check for nil instead of using hasKey, but try this:\nDefaults[\"firstInstallDate\"].object == nil\nThe subscript itself always returns a NSUserDefaults.Proxy, so it will never be nil.\n. Very interesting! Thanks @phimage. Not sure I understand, though, what's the benefit of writing Defaults[\"foo\"][\"bar\"] over Defaults[\"foo.bar\"]?\n. I don't understand why prefix your defaults with something like a bundle name? I mean, the standardUserDefaults are already scoped to your app only.\n. Hm. That's a fair point, though I would say it's the 3rd party frameworks' responsibility to prefix the stuff they save in my user defaults\u2026\nLet me think about this\u2026\n. You're right! I'll merge it in later today :)\n. Alright, done! I merged to master and cut a new release: 1.1.0. I haven't tested it with CocoaPods but it should work just fine.\nThanks for the reminded @jschmid!\nPS. \"later today\", LOL.\n. I appologize for not replying before. I couldn't reproduce your problem.\nCould you try it again with CocoaPods 0.37.1?\n. Great, glad to hear that!\n. Carthage support would be great, but I'm not familiar with the system myself\u2026 I'd definitely be willing to merge it in if someone prepared a pull request.\n. Added by @alec-c4 via #14 :)\n. Apologies to have kept you waiting. I'll do my best to properly test your code in the weekend (I don't have experience with Carthage) and unless there's some issue, I'll merge it in :)\n. Hey @alec-c4 . I haven't forgot about it, I'm just terribly, embarrassingly bad at side projects and keeping commitments related to them.\nI took a look at your changes, played with Carthage, and it all looks great. Thank you for your work and sorry I kept you waiting so long.\n. I'm not familiar with using NSKeyedArchiver with NSUserDefaults \u2014 I'm not sure if it's a common pattern or not.\nIf it is, I'd be definitely happy to add a pair of helpers for writing/accessing archived objects to the user defaults.\nIf anyone is interested in this feature, please give your feedback below \u263a\ufe0f\n. Cool. @pellekrogholt @tbaranes @katopz any specific suggestions as for the API you'd like to see for (de)serializing NSObjects?\n. @katopz @pellekrogholt @tbaranes Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I think I have a pretty great solution on the next branch. Check out http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/ for more background and explanation. Let me know what you think!\n. Thanks @rad3ks, but #14 already added Carthage support (it just took me a while to get it merged).\nCould you elaborate about why XCTAssert is better than assert? I mean, I know the latter doesn't integrate with Xcode, but for the purposes of this project, it works fine. What do you mean about running for \"each platform individually\"?\n. No, the only issue is println in the test target. \n. Still, surprising we didn't need any changes really in this library :)\n. Sorry, I forgot to push a new release. Should work now.\n(FWIW, the new tag only introduces Carthage support, so v1.1 is functionally the same)\n. That does look useful. Not sure about NSDate() since it represents the current, not \"empty\" date, but 0, [], [:], \"\", etc. often do make sense.\n. Still don't know about this\u2026 Is 1970 a natural, obvious \"null value\" that we want people to use, implicitly?\n. Hm, I'll think about this.\nNot merging this PR just yet, but I will ;)\n. Merged. Thanks.\nI removed objectValue and dateValue before merging. I'm not convinced of the usefulness of their default value behavior. I'd rather people do this explicitly.\n(If people complain about this and make a convincing argument for it, I'll put it back.)\n. Thanks. I'll take a look at this in spare time.\n. Thanks for the pull request, Xavi.\nTwo notes:\n1. I wish you hadn't reordered tests the way you did. Grouping them by SwiftyUserDefaults' function makes more sense than grouping them by a user default type.\n2. Clearing of the user defaults was done in setUp on purpose. Yes, it's good to clean up after yourself, but we don't want garbage from previous tests interfering with our tests. So it should definitely be done before tests.\n. No specific reason as far as I can remember. \n. Thanks @kaunteya. I intend to merge this, but I'm going to hold off until a 2.0 release, since changing the return types might break things.\n. Thanks again. Sorry for not responding for so long. I originally merged those changes to next, but the end, I don't think I want to change it. The reason why is because I think the new approach in the next (2.0) branch is much better (give this a read for more info: http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/) and I want to promote that instead. I'm going to treat the Proxy-based API as legacy, probably deprecate it eventually, and so I'd rather just not change anything.\n. Thanks! Glad you like it. \n. Oops, thanks. \n. Thank you! I merged your changes into the next branch here: https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/commit/d2b749109ae47404e678144a74d31194bfedd5a5\n. Thanks @kohtenko, but the ++ and += operators in SwiftyUserDefaults have really confusing and potentially dangerous semantics. I don't like them anymore.\nCheck out http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/ and the next branch. Swift's -- and -= just work out of the box with the new approach.\n. Please be more specific. Why do you want to override the Proxy class? Real world examples, please. \n. I'm going to close this now. Let me know if you have a good argument for making it public.\n. Thanks for the PR. Having URL support would certainly make sense.\nCan you elaborate on the ?= problem you're describing? ?= shouldn't be used with nil \u2014 it just doesn't make sense to assign a nil to something when it's nil\u2026\n. That sounds like a Swift bug. Have you filed a radar?\n. Okay, thanks for letting me know. I'll think about it. I just don't want to make it look like you're supposed to pass an optional to ?= \u2014 you're not.\n. I added NSURL support on the next branch. Thanks again!\n. You must be using the old version of the library\n. It should be 1.3.0\n. Have you tried running pod update?\n. Thank you! I merged that into the next branch \u2014 can you verify it works?\n. This is NSUserDefaults concern \u2014 SwiftyUserDefaults is just a wrapper around this. Hopefully, people are now dropping support for iOS 7 ahead of iOS 9 and this won't matter anymore. Thanks.\n. Done on the next branch. Thanks!\n. Hey @IdoBn, thanks for this, check out the next branch for Swift 2 compatibility and some cool new stuff :)\n. That's what I get for changing things in the last minute. Thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. That would be more confusing than helpful. \"Right now\" is not an obvious, universally-correct default value for a date. I'd rather have you use ?? NSDate() explicitly if that's what you want.\n. 0 is \"empty\", false is empty, \"\" is empty\u2026 \"right now\" isn't empty.\n. Exactly the kind of thing I'm worried about. Seems faaaaar less likely to do such a mistake with default values for other types. \n. What a perfect piece of evidence that accidental NSDate/NSData typos happen ;)\n. Thanks @jschmid!\n. I guess the way I'd do it is:\nfor (key, _) in Defaults.dictionaryRepresentation() {\n            Defaults.removeObjectForKey(key)\n}\nbut yeah, it wouldn't be too bad to have a shortcut for that in SwiftyUserDefaults.\n. I added Defaults.removeAll() in 1ac8701. Hope this solves it.\n. no, that's a mistake\u2026 Should support 10.9 and up\u2026\n. Soon. I want to ship the 2.0 tonight. \n. Fixed, thanks for letting me know about this!\n. I did mention it in the post. Subscripts don't support generic constraints in Swift 2. Which makes me very sad. (But from API consumer point of view, I still like this better than the alternative)\n. Also a cool approach, but I like SUD's syntax better, and some of the semantics and safety with getting/setting ;)\n. Do it and I'll merge it ;)\n. @staticdreams that'd be great \u2014 if you don't mind making a PR, I'll merge it :) \n. Thanks @Antoine4011 @mathiasnagler! I'm closing this PR as #53 is newer :) \n. Thanks!\n. A few reasons:\n1. Syntax. I like the dictionary-like feel of Defaults[.prop] vs Defaults.prop.value.\n2. And it's a little bit shorter\n3. And that it feels like it makes a bit more sense with you subscripting a collection, not calling \"value\" on the key itself\n4. If you're not using the standard user defaults, but some other NSUserDefaults (e.g. shared defaults in an app group), you can just subscript a different defaults object \u2014 the key object only describes the key, not the collection\nYeah, it's kind of an implementation PITA, but I'm not concerned with that in this project \u2014 it's not an approach I would usually take, but I slightly prefer this approach to what you're suggesting. I'm cool with magic.\n. This is a problem with the underlying Apple framework, not my code.\nThe synchronize stuff only matters in iOS 7. You're not supposed to use it in later versions. \n. It should be. \n. It doesn't. Do it yourself if you need to support iOS 7. Otherwise, do nothing. \n. Why do you want to use Float and not Double?\n. Hm. Lack of support for floats was a deliberate decision -- Swift strongly recommends just using Double everywhere. The fact that UISlider reports Float -- I consider that an interop limitation. \n. Nope. Swift encourages people to just use Int and Double. Float is great when you need the efficiency \u2014 that is, when you have significant arrays of them (SCNVector3 is probably a good use case, I think). Otherwise, it just doesn't matter.\n. I don't want to teach people bad habits. It's not difficult to cast to/from Double :) . > ld: warning: directory not found for option '-F/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS9.1.sdk/Developer/Library/Frameworks'\n@mrahmiao do you still have this problem? The other warnings are working as designed.\n. Ah, nevermind, I see the same warning. Not sure what's the cause but I'll accept a fix.\n. @ton03 I'll accept a patch.\n. @ton03 I no longer reproduce any warnings except for deprecation warnings (working as intended) while updating with carthage. I'm closing this issue, but let me know if you can still see the problem.\n. > This code which is recommended does not autocomplete:\nOh well. Xcode\u2014Swift integration is not yet as good as I'd like it to be. This sort of thing generally auto-completes (with enum cases and all), but apparently not here. (Not yet, anyway)\n\nObviously there is a bad design decision on the name. Please change it so it is clear what Keys and Key does.\n\nThe only purpose for both classes existing is to work around compiler limitations. Explained here: http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/\n\nThis works and autocompletes:\nvar userDefault = Defaults[DefaultsKeys.userId]\nBut, this does not work:\n\nWorks for me \u2014 what's the DefaultsKeys.userId implementation?\n\nMaybe some shortcut like:\nvar userDefault = Defaults[Defs.userId]\nmight be useful\n\nGo ahead, define a Defs struct \u2014 also an approach I'm cool with (again: http://radex.io/swift/nsuserdefaults/static/). There's nothing magical about DefaultsKeys except for the fact that it allows for the shortcut .foo. If you don't like the dot-shortcut syntax because it doesn't play well with autocompletion, you don't have to use it.\n. Having statically-defined default values would be very nice indeed. I need to consider more closely if there's a nice way to achieve that given current Swift limitations (no generic subscripts, no extending generic types, etc...)\nCould you explain this bit?\nDefaultsKey<String, UIColor>([\"color\": UIColor.grayColor()])\nWhy does it have two type params and a dictionary \u2014 I don't get it?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @mathiasnagler!\n. That was quick, thanks!\n. Extend DefaultsKeys, not DefaultsKey -- the whole purpose of the former is to work around this compiler limitation\n. Thanks :)\n. @staticdreams Apologies for not doing it months ago. I've just released v2.1.0\n. Awesome work!\nOne thing annoys me, API design-wise: so far, we used optionals in the type parameter String vs String? to convey whether a key should be returned as optional or with a default value.\nAdding custom default values makes this possibly confusing a bit, because it doesn't make any sense to have a T? defaults key with a custom default value defined.\nI want to think of ways to clarify this if possible and disallow the behavior that doesn't make any sense.\nIdeas? Discussion welcome.\n. I would do a quick crash, as this should just be illegal (IMHO). Would be best to have this checked at compile-time, but I'm not sure what's the best approach. Don't like the idea of subclassing DefaultsKey much.\n. Hm, is there no way to do this without defining a new protocol?\nAlso: you should use precondition()\n. Agree, it makes sense. I would call the protocol OptionalType, for consistency with other protocol names. (Not that it makes a huge difference \u2014\u00a0it's private anyway).\nAlso, what I meant by using precondition was to drop the guard altogether:\nprecondition(!(defaultValue is OptionalType), \"Failure message\")\n. Yes, a more versatile solution would be great \n. Alright all:\n1. I would be happy to add support for easy serialization of RawRepresentable values. Indeed, this would be great for enums\n2. I would also be cool with adding a protocol like SwiftyUserDefaultsSerializable for (un)archiving of any custom, Swift-only type. (Unless someone has a better idea of how to solve it).\nPR-s are very welcome.\n. @staticdreams Yes, but not directly. If your enum is RawRepresentable, you can store the underlying value via .rawValue, then recreate it when reading using init?(rawValue:).\nYou can quite easily extend NSUserDefaults to add a subscript for DefaultsKey<YourEnumType> that does this behind the scenes for you.\nThis should be simpler.\n. \u2705 Added easy RawRepresentable support in SwiftyUserDefaults 2.2\nStill no SwiftyUserDefaultsSerializable, because then you have to write both an NSUserDefaults extension and an extension on your own type. Until we can get the proper subscripts automatically (maybe Swift 3), it's not really much better\u2026 I could, however, document how to add support for completely custom types\u2026\n. > I guess the other warnings are not meant to be resolved?\nIf they're coming from my code then no.\n. Thanks \u2014 I hope this actually compiles ;)\n. This is a cool idea, but out of scope for this library.\n. Yeah, that should be simpler, but swift compiler limitations don't allow me. \n. Thank you.\n. @ajaysinghthakur Please use Stack Overflow in the future, as this isn't an appropriate place to ask this kind of questions.\n@ed-mejia is right, this code will work:\nswift\nfor (key, _) in Defaults.dictionaryRepresentation() {\n     Defaults.removeObjectForKey(key)\n }\n. @ajaysinghthakur there is a tag: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/swiftyuserdefaults\n. > I just got that error too. I assume the library doesn't support multidimensional arrays?\nNo, it doesn't. Until Swift becomes more powerful, you can only define and use DefaultsKey on one of the supported types. You can, however, quite easily extend NSUserDefaults and add support for a given DefaultsKey type.\n. @toshi0383 Very cool! I understand this works regardless of whether or not SwiftyUserDefaults is used? i.e. if someone sets a value using plain old NSUserDefaults API, this will still work?\n. Thanks \u2014 I'll review it more closely when I have more time, but could you explain to me the design of this code in the meantime? Like, why are there three observe* methods, what's the purpose of BlockDisposable and RecursiveLock?\n. Beginning iOS 9.3, you can actually observe changes made to your user defaults from outside the app:\nhttps://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/711972673367052288\nVery cool.\n. Nice. The problem is \u2014 why should [[Bool]] be the special exception?\nUntil we can express automatic support for any reasonable key type in Swift, I suggest:\n- we drop the [[Bool]] support\n- we add getTwoDimensionalArray a user can use\n- add a note to README as for how to add support for additional types like this.\nI would be happy to merge that.\nAnd if you were inclined to also add support for arbitrary dictionaries the same way (only [String: AnyObject] is supported out of the box), that would be awesome.\n. > We should be able to have automatic support for the common keys, I am not sure how that will work.\nNot possible without generic subscripts.\n. No, this really doesn't work. https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-115 tracks this issue. \n. @MaxHasADHD I don't understand what you're trying to say \u2014 can you elaborate?\n. OK, got it. #59 was proposing an alternative to using registerDefaults, instead, embedding the default value in the DefaultsKey definition.\nThe latter definitely seems cleaner, but registerDefaults has the advantage of working across NSUserDefaults, whether or not you actually use SwiftyUserDefaults and those key values.\n. Please do not store sensitive data in user defaults. It's not meant for it, and it's unsafe to do so.\nI have no plans for encryption. SwiftyUserDefaults is a Swifty API for NSUserDefaults, nothing more.\n. I'm not really comfortable extending the Proxy getters, because I think the way to go forward is to use statically-typed keys instead of the old stringly-typed API...\nI think I can merge it anyway, but please open a pull request.\n.

Apologies if I'm doing something totally dumb \u2014 I've never used swift pm before\n. Okay, I must be completely blind, my PATH was pointing at a December snapshot of swift\n. IT WORKS :D Thank you @valentinknabel.\n. Thanks.\n. Let me know if I need to cut a new version for this to work automatically \u2014 I don't know much about Carthage.\n. Okay, I think https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/pull/77 fixes just this issue \u2014 can you verify it? I think I have to cut a new release tag.\n. Regarding deprecations: people still use those. I would have to cut a 3.0 to remove them. I could also lose the warnings if I removed tests for them, but hey, again, people still use them. I wish I could silence Swift deprecation warnings, but I don't think I can. (the deprecations, after all, are meant for the users, not my test target)\n. OK, I just pushed 2.1.3 with the fix and also found a way to suppress deprecation warnings. Let me know if there's still a problem.\n. One way is to just define in your app:\nvar SomeOtherDefaults = NSUserDefaults(...)\nand use that instead of Defaults.\nWould that fix it for you? Or do you need the ability to quickly switch between arbitrary suites?\n. > I think it'd be handy to set global suiteName once, somewhere early (e.g. in AppDelegate):\n\nDefaults.suiteName = \"group.my.appGroup\"\n\nI'd much prefer the declarative version:\nvar Defaults = NSUserDefaults(suiteName: ...)\nThis is cleaner to me, and has the advantage that you can put it in a separate file you can share between targets...\n. >  you may loose data saved to defaults unless you manually call Defaults.synchronize() each time you change something because the system may kill the process suddenly, to the best of my understanding (and in the case of running from Xcode, if you stop the project just at the right time, it won't save either).\nYou could be right, but all I keep hearing (from @Catfish-Man on Twitter, mostly) is that calling synchronize() is simply not necessary.\n. @Catfish-Man Thank you for the info!\n. Ok, so:\n- synchronize seems to be unnecessary save for some very extreme conditions, so I don't see a reason to add it to SUD\n- you can define a var Defaults = NSUserDefaults(suiteName: ...) in your own module to shadow the Defaults shortcut defined by the library.\nI'm closing this for now, but let me know if I missed something from the discussion.\n. Very cool work. I have reservations about this, because using a plist to register defaults means you don't get any type checking by the compiler \u2014 i.e. no way to verify correctness of your registered defaults. For example if you try to rename a default during development, but forget to change your plist, you'll have created a bug.\nI think the approach I would prefer to promote is a statically typed one, like so:\nDefaults.register([\n     .userName: 'radex',\n     .launchCount: 0,\n])\n(The actual implementation and syntax would be trickier, but I think you get the point.)\nWhat do you think about that?\n. > The reason I leaned on the plist is because it's easier to control the defaults when distributing multiple apps, i.e. code stays the same across apps with differences only in the plist.\nGood observation, but you can do the same with Swift, no?\n```\n// UserDefaults.swift\nextension DefaultsKeys {\n     static let userName = DefaultsKey(\"userName\")\n}\nvar Defaults = NSUserDefaults(defaults: [\n     .userName: 'radex',\n])\n```\n. Great, thank you for working on this!\n. > If we're not going to read from plist, then I prefer to set default values in the DefaultKeys extension \nBut this way, the default values won't be visible to non-Swifty NSUserDefaults users. Unless you specifically register those DefaultsKey objects, but at that point it's better to do the whole default registering separately.\n\notherwise a race condition can be introduced\n\ncould you explain?\n. > In this example, viewDidLoad can be called before didFinishLaunchingWithOptions as discussed here. That means the screen will display a blank username, before the defaults are registered.\nWhoa, this is crazy! Thanks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I didn't know it.\nOne idea: make people register their defaults while initializing their Defaults object:\nvar Defaults = NSUserDefaults(defaults: [\n     .userName: 'radex',\n])\nThis ensures defaults registering happens before first Defaults access.\n. So I've been thinking about how to actually implement this statically-typed defaults dictionary.\nNow, we can't actually do it as a dictionary, because we need the requirement for the value to be T matching key's DefaultsKey AND the ability to have key/value pairs of different types. There's no way to express that in Swift.\nYou could do it as tuples, i.e. [ (.userName, \"radex\"), (.launchCount, 0) ], but that would make the array [(DefaultsKeys, Any)], an there's no compile-time type check. Sigh.\nSo I have two concepts that might be possible to implement.\nOne would be a builder DSL:\nregisterDefaults(.userName, \"radex\")\n    .and(.launchCount, 10)\n    .and(.this, that)\nregisterDefaults() would be <T>(DefaultsKey<T>, T), and would return something like DefaultsBuilder, which would have a method and with the same signature.\nAnother option would be something like:\nregisterDefaults([\n    .key(.userName, \"radex\"),\n    .key(.launchCount, 10),\n])\nregisterDefaults would take an array of DefaultsKeyValue (name tbd), which would have a static func key (also looking for a better name) \u2014\u00a0essentially a factory method returning the same type. The method would be <T>(DefaultsKey<T>, T) to type-check the passed stuff.\nNot super in love with either concept. Do you have better ideas?\n. @stephencelis very nice! The second option, with subscripts, doesn't work because I'd have to duplicate all the (non-generic) subscripts. The first option is really nice, though.\n@basememara this is syntactically superior but has two problems:\n- it saves a new value, instead of registering a default\n- static lets are lazily evaluated IIRC, so if someone accesses user defaults outside of DefaultsKey, the default registering won't work. \n. Actually just realized registering defaults in a global var Defaults = ... has the same issue \u2014 it will be evaluated lazily :(\nIdeas? If applicationFinishedLaunching... isn't a good place to do it, then perhaps init is?\n. Nice catch!\n. Hey, thank you for bringing this to my attention. Can you narrow down the memory leak to a test case? I can't think of a legitimate reason a leak could happen in the subscript setter\u2026\nMaybe it's a Swift bug, and when you pass an array to the setter (which gets converted to NSArray), a leak happens there\u2026\nHave you tested on Xcode 7.3?\n. Have you seen the issue since then @goktugyil?. That's so strange. Why would there be array appends? SwiftyUserDefaults doesn't maintain any internal array state\u2026 are you doing any setting of arrays? Perhaps there's something wonky going on during casting when you do that?. Explain rationale?\n. OK, I'm cool with this change, but would you mind adding a /// ... documentation comment to explain the method? A small test case wouldn't hurt either.\n. Thanks!\n. Personally not a fan of observing user defaults, I think generally there are better ways than this. But I'm pretty sure you can do KVO on NSUserDefaults. (Since iOS 9.3, this even works if changes are made outside of your app's process)\n. Sorry, no plans for ObjC support, but you're more than welcome to fork the project or try to re-implement the API in ObjC.\n. yeah, travis isn't configured with Xcode 8 so tests won't pass...\n. > Browsing through the changes, I notice that NSDate and NSData have been changed to Date and Data respectively, which left me wondering if the same should happen to NSArray and NSDictionary for consistency in returning value types?\n\nEdit: Or whether in fact it's more desirable to keep NSDate and NSData for reference types. But I guess that the NS-reference stuff is less swifty?\n\nI want to avoid changing the API of UserDefaults.Proxy because I consider it a legacy API \u2014 and I strongly want to encourage people to use the new, static key-based API. In the latter, it's definitely desirable to change NSDate etc to new types. (But maybe still makes sense to keep the old one as deprecated to ease the transition? Just like I've kept DefaultsKey<NSArray> if it's easier for someone to use that...)\n. btw. thanks everyone for chiming in this discussion! I definitely intend to take a closer look and start an official swift3 branch sometime soon!\n. > I looked at making a single code base that could compile in both environments but I don't think the code complexity would be worth it. Better to just make a hard fork.\nI agree as far as Swift 2/3 compatibility is concerned. The shipping version of SwiftyUserDefaults compiles just fine with Swift 2.3, so people can keep using that for as long as they need. Next version will be Swift 3-only.\nAside from that though, I want to make API transitions in the library itself as smooth as possible. Otherwise people get frustrated, stop updating, and in the end everyone's worse off. That's why there are still things in the codebase marked as \"deprecated\", but not removed completely.\n. > @radex when would you like to new swift 3.0 support branch\nAs soon as possible, sorry, just couldn't find time to do it just yet.\n. Thank you @askari01 for submitting this pull request and everyone for chiming in!\nI merged this PR into swift3 branch: https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/tree/swift3\nI will merge this into master when Swift 3 is out.\nBe sure to submit pull requests if there's any issues on Swift 3, or if the library can be improved with Swift 3 changes! Thanks!\n. For now, feel free to use the branch from https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/pull/91 :) \n. On swift3 branch. Thanks for your patience!\n. Thank you!\n. I converted most of the README to use Swift 3 names and syntax and to account for changes made in #105.\nhttps://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/blob/swift3/README.md\nWould really appreciate if someone took a second close look!\n. No, only deprecated with Defaults[\"foo\"]++. When using static keys, it's fine. Different mechanism.\n. Ah, duh! Thanks.\n. Thanks @arthurhammer \u2014 fixed.\n. #98 fixed this, thanks again to @BalestraPatrick :)\n. This is awesome, thank you!\n. If it fixes it (I don't use Carthage), you should totally open a PR adding SWIFT_VERSION=2.3 to the project file :)\n. Thank you!\n. thanks\n. Ha! Very cool. Shame we can't (not without generic subscripts) make it work more broadly out of the box. This addition might be useful for someone, but they have to know they can use it to implement their own subscript...\nWhat's your motivation to store, say, CGSize, like this? Why not store it as a [\"width\": 10, \"height\": 10]. That's how I imagine I would probably do it\u2026 Simpler, because you only have to deal with one user defaults key...\n. Oops. Done.\n. Happy to accept PRs\n. Done in #106.\n. > @radex Updated to address your comments. It looks like there is a way to check for [Any] == [Any] by doing something like:\n\nXCTAssertEqual(a as NSArray, b as NSArray)\n\nUgh, that's awful :(\n\nIt seems very hacky that we have to go through ObjC classes though. In the meantime, I updated the tests to have more thorough asserts by checking for equality of each members. Let me know if you want me to use the NSArray/NSDictionary cast in tests.\n\nNo, let's stick to your one-by-one checks, at least for now. We'll see how the behavior of [Any] evolves in Swift 3.x\u2026\n. OK, thank you again @ldiqual! If you could just revert the archive/unarchive implementation to what I suggested in the inline comment, I'll merge the PR right away \ud83d\udc4d\n. That's weird...\n. Okay, I went ahead and made the changes myself. Thank you @ldiqual for the great work! And apologies for everyone observing that it took so long.\n. If someone sent a PR for this, I'd be very grateful! \u2764\ufe0f . Started playing with this here: https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults/blob/travis-fix/.travis.yml but not sure I can figure it out myself\u2026 \n. I will release it officially when Xcode 8 is out. For now, you'd have to specify SwiftyUserDefaults by pointing to the branch\n. Oh. I'll try to release it tomorrow or the day after that, then.\n. @kylebrowning I'm working on it, but having issues with CocoaPods: https://twitter.com/radexp/status/776191981831778309\n. @kylebrowning @brightsider OK, this should be out now! Can you verify and let me know if this works for you? Thanks!\n. The approach I would recommend is to have a struct type representing your value and then extend UserDefaults with a subscript(key: DefaultsKey<MyStruct>) -> MyStruct that can (de)serialize the struct to a dictionary.\n\nDefaults[.myStoredValue.maxScore]\n\nSadly this syntax is not possible.\n. Thank you @asowers1. Can you explain why this change is needed? Does it not compile, or throw warnings? CocoaPods, Carthage?\n. Thanks for the report!\n. Thanks!\n. @max-potapov done!\n. Hey, the best way for you is to extend UserDefaults and add the right subscript yourself \u2014 it's not difficult.\nThose types are not built in by design \u2014 in 99% cases, one should just use Int and Double.\n. I have no idea what the question is.\n. Oops, typo! Nice catch @DivineDominion. Care to send a quick PR?. @Eitot does it still not work? Have you verified it's a SwiftyUserDefault issue and not an old version of SPM?. Hmm, that sounds like SPM wants to use the Tests/ files but shouldn't\u2026 I don't use SPM myself \u2014 if you could take a look a this an submit a PR that would be \ud83d\udcaf . I'm closing this. @rjcristy if you care to explain the issue, I'll reopen.. Exactly. Thank you @iDurian for the PR, but calling synchronize every time after set is a cargo cult of sorts. David Smith said so himself in some other PR/issue on this repo.. Thanks @DivineDominion !. Thank you! I'll try to take a look at this next week and tag a new version :). I haven't really dealt with NSArchiver before. What's the advantage/use of this over NSCoder?. Why not just save the two values of a CGRect as an array under one key?. Fair enough.. Thank you @humblehacker!. The method already exists, and it's Defaults.synchronize(). Note that it's not recommended to use it in normal circumstances. But if you need to ensure synchronization for testing reasons, there you go. Good stuff, thank you! I will check it out soon :). Thanks!. I don't believe array of enums is compatible with NSCoding. You have to encode by mapping to rawValue, and decode by reinstatiating from rawValue..... ",

I updated the readme docs and added a ton of unit tests for it.

Why doesn't it make sense that optionals can have a default value? The default value should be stored during the initialization of the storage key. Something like if key doesn't exist, then create storage with default value, but after that it would still make sense to store nil in there.\nEdit: On second thought #69 would probably take care of this then you can just do this for optionals discussed here: DefaultsKey<String?>(\"username\") ?? \"some default\"\n. Hey, not sure if this is somewhat related or useful here, but I was able to get an array of dictionaries to work:\n```\npublic extension NSUserDefaults {\n    public subscript(key: DefaultsKey<[[String: AnyObject]]>) -> [[String: AnyObject]] {\n        get {\n            return arrayForKey(key._key) as?

String else { return }\nprint(\"Forth category title: (value)\") // Health\n// set value\nDefaults[.categories][3][\"title\"] = \"Health and Fitness\"\n```\nTo put things into perspective, the structure looks something like this:\n\nIt seems to work well for get and set. I hope this helps.\n. Cool, glad it makes sense. Here's the pull request to take a further look, which has an updated readme and unit test: #88\n. Ah I didn't realize Defaults is a global variable created for convenience. Do you think in the source code we'll have to add synchronize() after the switch in the set?:\npublic subscript(key: String) -> Any? {\n        get {\n            // return untyped Proxy\n            // (make sure we don't fall into infinite loop)\n            let proxy: Proxy = self[key]\n            return proxy\n        }\n        set {\n            switch newValue {\n            case let v as Int: setInteger(v, forKey: key)\n            case let v as Double: setDouble(v, forKey: key)\n            case let v as Bool: setBool(v, forKey: key)\n            case let v as NSURL: setURL(v, forKey: key)\n            case let v as NSObject: setObject(v, forKey: key)\n            case nil: removeObjectForKey(key)\n            default: assertionFailure(\"Invalid value type\")\n            }\n            synchronize()\n        }\n    }\nFrom my experience, it won't hurt to call synchronize() even if the user defaults is not using a suiteName.\n. Your suggested version is very nice and would be very handy! I like!\nThe reason I leaned on the plist is because it's easier to control the defaults when distributing multiple apps, i.e. code stays the same across apps with differences only in the plist. There is some level of type checking in the plist though, since when choosing the type in the \"Type\" column, Xcode will not allow you to put a string in a number type for example.\n. Wait I think I understand what you're saying, if I change the type later in the plist, things will crash. Hmmm, I'll give it more thought. I do still like your suggestion.\n. Yes, I think you are right. A .plist or .swift file is just semantics but can work just the same if you want a single place to control across various apps. My thoughts were the .plist files were designed to control app settings, but it might be worth the trade for compiler checks if putting in a .swift file instead.\nI'll give it more thought if there are any other benefits we're missing for .plist vs .swift file for defaults and will take another stab at it using your suggestion.\n. If we're not going to read from plist, then I prefer to set default values in the DefaultKeys extension so it's all in one place like in #59, otherwise a race condition can be introduced. I'll piggyback on the #59 branch and see if I can contribute anything there. I think that's the right idea if we're going to go the .swift file route for defaults.\n. I see about the non-SwiftyUserDefaults users not getting to those values. Because that branch is not actually saving to NSUserDefaults, but it should be updated to do that. That is a good catch.\nThe race condition I'm concerned about is something like:\n```\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {\n        Defaults.register([\n            .userName: 'radex',\n            .launchCount: 0,\n            ])\n    return true\n}\n\n```\nThen in one of your view controllers you do this:\nclass FirstViewController: UIViewController {\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        someLabel.text = Defaults[.userName]\n    }\n}\nIn this example, viewDidLoad can be called before didFinishLaunchingWithOptions as discussed here. That means the screen will display a blank username, before the defaults are registered.\n. Ya it's depressing, it's almost as if there's no good place to put code that initializes before your views.\nSweet, I like the convince init you suggest - better than the original. Thanks for the input again :D\n. Something hit me from something you said about @delba's implementation that might simplify everything. How about just adding this convenience init to DefaultKeys:\n```\npublic class DefaultsKey: DefaultsKeys {\n    public let _key: String\npublic init(_ key: String) {\n    self._key = key\n}\n\npublic convenience init(_ key: String, _ defaultValue: ValueType) {\n    self.init(key)\n\n    if !Defaults.hasKey(key) {\n        Defaults[key] = defaultValue\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nThat's all the code update we need since all it's doing is storing the value into NSUserDefaults. And because the value is persisted first thing, everything after in SwiftyUserDefaults follows the natural flow as it did before without further code changes needed.\nWhat I like about this is there is no race conditions introduced and the code change is super minimal. Also, a big benefit is all defaults are packaged in the declaration of the DefaultKeys in one place. It would look like this:\nextension DefaultsKeys {\n    public static let someString1 = DefaultsKey<String>(\"SomeString1\")\n    static let someString2 = DefaultsKey<String>(\"SomeString2\", \"abc\") // default added\n    static let someNumber1 = DefaultsKey<Int>(\"SomeNumber1\")\n    static let someNumber2 = DefaultsKey<Int>(\"SomeNumber2\", 888) // default added\n    static let someBool1 = DefaultsKey<Bool>(\"SomeBool1\")\n    static let someBool2 = DefaultsKey<Bool>(\"SomeBool2\", true)\n    static let someDate1 = DefaultsKey<NSDate>(\"SomeDate1\")\n    static let someDate2 = DefaultsKey<NSDate>(\"SomeDate2\", NSDate()) // default added\n}\nThe only thing we'd have to resolve is the suiteName situation since this is under the assumption that Defaults should always be NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults(). But this is another topic that is ongoing in another thread.\n. I had a break-thru in regards to this discussion that I'd like to document here. Apparently, the best place to register defaults is indeed in AppDelegate.init:\n```\n@UIApplicationMain\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n    var window: UIWindow?\noverride init() {\n    super.init()\n    Defaults.registerDefaults([\n        \"userName\": \"radex\",\n        \"launchCount\": 10\n    ])\n}\n\nfunc application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {\n      ...\n}\n\n}\n```\nNote that the native registerDefaults function will register the values to your UserDefaults for the entire lifecycle of your app; it will not persist to it. Once your app terminates and start up again in the future, those values will not be in your UserDefaults anymore unless you keep registering the defaults in the beginning of your app (or before you need them).\n. BTW I believe all these are related to the same topic and would be great if we can consolidate them somehow: #51, #59, #69, #81\n. I agree the set should be made public. In the readme you say that you can create custom types, but this is not possible unless you redefine the set function in the consuming side.\nFor testing this, in TestHelper you are already defining custom types that use that same set function which still work. The only way to really test this is to create a module outside of the workspace, consume SwiftyUserDefaults, then define custom types without having to explicitly recreate the set function.\nI just tried this in my app by consuming SwiftyUserDefaults via Carthage, adding the checkout to my workspace, and modify the source code to make the set public. I was able to define my own custom types without having to redefine the set function \ud83d\udc4d \n. Check this out: https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/855713943809032192\n\n. The long awaited generic subscript is here. This should reduce the code base tremendously.. Sorry, missed the many PR's regarding Swift 4 updates.. Check out my pull request (#81) and see if that works for everyone (including @MaxHasADHD too). It adds an extended version of registerDefaults. I updated the readme docs and added a ton of unit tests for it. You'd use it like this:\n```\nlet Defaults = NSUserDefaults.registerDefaults(\"Settings.plist\")\nlet Defaults2 = NSUserDefaults.registerDefaults(\"Settings.plist\", suiteName: \"io.radex.SwiftyUserDefaults\")\nlet Defaults3 = NSUserDefaults.registerDefaults(bundleName: \"Settings\")\nlet key1 = DefaultsKey(\"MyString1\")\nDefaults[key1] == \"My string value 1.\" // true\n```\nAnd the plist would look something like this:\n\n.

Something like if key doesn't exist, then create storage with default value, but after that it would still make sense to store nil in there.\nEdit: On second thought #69 would probably take care of this then you can just do this for optionals discussed here: DefaultsKey<String?>(\"username\") ?? \"some default\"\n. Hey, not sure if this is somewhat related or useful here, but I was able to get an array of dictionaries to work:\n```\npublic extension NSUserDefaults {\n    public subscript(key: DefaultsKey<[[String: AnyObject]]>) -> [[String: AnyObject]] {\n        get {\n            return arrayForKey(key._key) as? [[String: AnyObject]] ?? [[:]]\n        }\n        set { set(key, newValue) }\n    }\nfunc set<T>(key: DefaultsKey<T>, _ value: [[String: AnyObject]]?) {\n    self[key._key] = value\n}\n\n}\n```\nThen I can use it like this:\n```\npublic extension DefaultsKeys {\n    public static let categories = DefaultsKey<[[String: AnyObject]]>(\"categories\")\n}\n// get value\nguard let value = Defaults[.categories][3][\"title\"] as? String else { return }\nprint(\"Forth category title: (value)\") // Health\n// set value\nDefaults[.categories][3][\"title\"] = \"Health and Fitness\"\n```\nTo put things into perspective, the structure looks something like this:\n\nIt seems to work well for get and set. I hope this helps.\n. Cool, glad it makes sense. Here's the pull request to take a further look, which has an updated readme and unit test: #88\n. Ah I didn't realize Defaults is a global variable created for convenience. Do you think in the source code we'll have to add synchronize() after the switch in the set?:\npublic subscript(key: String) -> Any? {\n        get {\n            // return untyped Proxy\n            // (make sure we don't fall into infinite loop)\n            let proxy: Proxy = self[key]\n            return proxy\n        }\n        set {\n            switch newValue {\n            case let v as Int: setInteger(v, forKey: key)\n            case let v as Double: setDouble(v, forKey: key)\n            case let v as Bool: setBool(v, forKey: key)\n            case let v as NSURL: setURL(v, forKey: key)\n            case let v as NSObject: setObject(v, forKey: key)\n            case nil: removeObjectForKey(key)\n            default: assertionFailure(\"Invalid value type\")\n            }\n            synchronize()\n        }\n    }\nFrom my experience, it won't hurt to call synchronize() even if the user defaults is not using a suiteName.\n. Your suggested version is very nice and would be very handy! I like!\nThe reason I leaned on the plist is because it's easier to control the defaults when distributing multiple apps, i.e. code stays the same across apps with differences only in the plist. There is some level of type checking in the plist though, since when choosing the type in the \"Type\" column, Xcode will not allow you to put a string in a number type for example.\n. Wait I think I understand what you're saying, if I change the type later in the plist, things will crash. Hmmm, I'll give it more thought. I do still like your suggestion.\n. Yes, I think you are right. A .plist or .swift file is just semantics but can work just the same if you want a single place to control across various apps. My thoughts were the .plist files were designed to control app settings, but it might be worth the trade for compiler checks if putting in a .swift file instead.\nI'll give it more thought if there are any other benefits we're missing for .plist vs .swift file for defaults and will take another stab at it using your suggestion.\n. If we're not going to read from plist, then I prefer to set default values in the DefaultKeys extension so it's all in one place like in #59, otherwise a race condition can be introduced. I'll piggyback on the #59 branch and see if I can contribute anything there. I think that's the right idea if we're going to go the .swift file route for defaults.\n. I see about the non-SwiftyUserDefaults users not getting to those values. Because that branch is not actually saving to NSUserDefaults, but it should be updated to do that. That is a good catch.\nThe race condition I'm concerned about is something like:\n```\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {\n        Defaults.register([\n            .userName: 'radex',\n            .launchCount: 0,\n            ])\n    return true\n}\n\n```\nThen in one of your view controllers you do this:\nclass FirstViewController: UIViewController {\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        someLabel.text = Defaults[.userName]\n    }\n}\nIn this example, viewDidLoad can be called before didFinishLaunchingWithOptions as discussed here. That means the screen will display a blank username, before the defaults are registered.\n. Ya it's depressing, it's almost as if there's no good place to put code that initializes before your views.\nSweet, I like the convince init you suggest - better than the original. Thanks for the input again :D\n. Something hit me from something you said about @delba's implementation that might simplify everything. How about just adding this convenience init to DefaultKeys:\n```\npublic class DefaultsKey: DefaultsKeys {\n    public let _key: String\npublic init(_ key: String) {\n    self._key = key\n}\n\npublic convenience init(_ key: String, _ defaultValue: ValueType) {\n    self.init(key)\n\n    if !Defaults.hasKey(key) {\n        Defaults[key] = defaultValue\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nThat's all the code update we need since all it's doing is storing the value into NSUserDefaults. And because the value is persisted first thing, everything after in SwiftyUserDefaults follows the natural flow as it did before without further code changes needed.\nWhat I like about this is there is no race conditions introduced and the code change is super minimal. Also, a big benefit is all defaults are packaged in the declaration of the DefaultKeys in one place. It would look like this:\nextension DefaultsKeys {\n    public static let someString1 = DefaultsKey<String>(\"SomeString1\")\n    static let someString2 = DefaultsKey<String>(\"SomeString2\", \"abc\") // default added\n    static let someNumber1 = DefaultsKey<Int>(\"SomeNumber1\")\n    static let someNumber2 = DefaultsKey<Int>(\"SomeNumber2\", 888) // default added\n    static let someBool1 = DefaultsKey<Bool>(\"SomeBool1\")\n    static let someBool2 = DefaultsKey<Bool>(\"SomeBool2\", true)\n    static let someDate1 = DefaultsKey<NSDate>(\"SomeDate1\")\n    static let someDate2 = DefaultsKey<NSDate>(\"SomeDate2\", NSDate()) // default added\n}\nThe only thing we'd have to resolve is the suiteName situation since this is under the assumption that Defaults should always be NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults(). But this is another topic that is ongoing in another thread.\n. I had a break-thru in regards to this discussion that I'd like to document here. Apparently, the best place to register defaults is indeed in AppDelegate.init:\n```\n@UIApplicationMain\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n    var window: UIWindow?\noverride init() {\n    super.init()\n    Defaults.registerDefaults([\n        \"userName\": \"radex\",\n        \"launchCount\": 10\n    ])\n}\n\nfunc application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {\n      ...\n}\n\n}\n```\nNote that the native registerDefaults function will register the values to your UserDefaults for the entire lifecycle of your app; it will not persist to it. Once your app terminates and start up again in the future, those values will not be in your UserDefaults anymore unless you keep registering the defaults in the beginning of your app (or before you need them).\n. BTW I believe all these are related to the same topic and would be great if we can consolidate them somehow: #51, #59, #69, #81\n. I agree the set should be made public. In the readme you say that you can create custom types, but this is not possible unless you redefine the set function in the consuming side.\nFor testing this, in TestHelper you are already defining custom types that use that same set function which still work. The only way to really test this is to create a module outside of the workspace, consume SwiftyUserDefaults, then define custom types without having to explicitly recreate the set function.\nI just tried this in my app by consuming SwiftyUserDefaults via Carthage, adding the checkout to my workspace, and modify the source code to make the set public. I was able to define my own custom types without having to redefine the set function \ud83d\udc4d \n. Check this out: https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/855713943809032192\n\n. The long awaited generic subscript is here. This should reduce the code base tremendously.. Sorry, missed the many PR's regarding Swift 4 updates.. ",
