    "carlsednaoui": "Done!\n. Let's do it!\n. Fixed!\n. @joshuachestang I haven't had a chance to build the modals out. You can use the designs provided in the readme as inspiration to build your own though :)\n. Taking care of with callback option in #8 \n. Awesome, I'll be merging this soon.\n. Thanks for the pull request @nilsine :)\n. :shipit: \n. Full of #win\n. Done & merged into CDNJS :)\nhttps://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/2918#issuecomment-39287853\n. Thanks for the PR @ayanev! I'll check out the code (and merge) this weekend.\n. Thanks @jenius! Passing the cookie expiration date as an option def looks like the right move.\n@ayanev, let me know if you want to review/ update the PR.\n. Added this in commit 2685ba5. Thanks @ayanev!\n. Agreed. @filipekiss, wanna review the PR? I can also work on this in the next few days.\n. Thanks for the pulled request :smile:  I ended up using a slightly different approach in 5d894eea3483690612c80573230976a5794cf2fc\n. :+1: This looks great! :shipit: \n. Good point @mcgwebdesign.\n@jenius, do you think this should be the default behavior? (Site-wide cookie) I think it makes sense to do so.\nWe could change line 56 in the source to\ndocument.cookie = 'viewedOuibounceModal=true' + cookieExpire + ';path=/';\n. @mcgwebdesign agreed with @jenius, a PR to include the option for site-wide cookie would be great.\nAs a side note, this logic shouldn't be part of ouibounce:\n\n1) user clicks out, show again in 5 days\n2) user fills out form, never show again\n\nYou will still need to build some logic on your own :)\n. :+1: :smile: \n. @mcgwebdesign as a side note, there's already a cookie expiration option\njs\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { cookieExpire: 10 });\nI think what you want to add is page-specific cookie v.s. site-wide cookie (an on / off option basically). The default should be site-wide cookie unless page-specific is set to True (or whatever naming convention we choose).\n. @mcgwebdesign saw you opened then closed a PR. Let me know when you're ready to submit :)\n. Awesome, thanks @mcgwebdesign! I'll take a look either tonight or this weekend at the latest :)\n. /note: Relevant PR #20 \n. Closing issue since there's a PR for it (#20).\n. Thanks for the suggestions but the current behavior works as expected for the tests. This may get revised when I write more tests for it.\nClosing for now.\n. @jenius, tried to clarify that gnarly ternary logic. Thoughts? 2ff8c3dec94e5b41d97774d46c2bf68a2c1c6e5d\n. @mcgwebdesign, let us know if you'll be writing tests for this :smiley: \n. Thanks @schonfeld! This was rebased and merged.\n/reference 1f8896e073382771e30c8d34afe1f0cfb938ac2f, c3ddb78a05cb57bf91435ac0a84b2e42839c0ac0\n. Wow, what a long thread. Thanks for the great contribution @jenius!\nTo answer the sensitivity setting on mouseout\n\nThe mouseout event is fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved off the element that has the listener attached or off one of its children.\nsource\n\nThis means that anytime the mouse moves away from html (or leaves the window) an event is sent. We then check the position of the mouse like so: e.clientY > sensitivity. This prevents ouibounce to fire when your mouse exits on the side of the screen, etc. There might be a better way to do this but this seems to work fine for our purposes.\nTo better understand the mouseout event you can clone this project and change the build file to have the following code on line 43:\nconsole.log('moused out');\nYou can then open up the test file in your browser and look at the console \u2014 you'll see the mouseout events firing.\nHope this helps. I'm gonna close this issue for now.\n. @jenius good ol' git push -f :back:\n. IT'S ON THE LINE, EVERYBODY WILL SEE THIS!\nMy shot at becoming the first French-American president is now forever gone :(\n\nAt least I got chicken\n. literally lol'ed :+1: :+1: :+1: \n. @dtdw, the plugin behaves as expected. As you mentioned, if you slowly move your mouse inside the window then the event will fire. To get rid of this (or limit it), move your mouse like a regular user (at regular speed) or decrease the sensitivity.\n\nClosing this issue for now. Please re-open if there's anything actionable.\n. Good point @dtdw, have you tried playing with sensitivity? If you set it to ~5 (or maybe even less) the odds of this happening will decrease tremendously.\nYou can also try to implement an alternative fix and submit a pull request :)\n. /note: Maybe we can make use of this. The demo is really cool.\n. That was good feedback @dtdw, I actually opened up a new issue \u2014 #26 \u2014 to look into it :) \n. And no worries about contributing, we're all learning as we go :smiley: \n. Just looked into this.\nHere's what's happening: whenever there's padding around the body (or any element at the top of the page), Ouibouce is likely to fire \u2014 this is because a mouseout event is called and the default sensitivity is pretty high. The 2 examples provided in the README link to GitHub pages, which have 50px of padding on the body.\nThe solution is to decrease the sensitivity \u2014 I tested it with sensitivity: 1 and it worked like a charm.\n/edit: The GH-Pages example's sensitivity has been updated with 3e431af0cec72dc4f4a7e5cd2d867ece7f57335a\n. @dtdw decreasing the sensitivity should take care of that.\nClosing for now. Re-open if that doesn't solve your problem.\n. @jenius how about this?\n\nThinking we could add interactivity options later. Thoughts?\n. Ahh, forgot about the pattern. I did this in PS, Sketch wasn't opening up for me (it was crashing), decided to redo it lol.\nHere is it with pattern\n\nAnd here's the 'shop file: http://cl.ly/0X3e0u00111Q\n/edit: here's the latest file: http://cl.ly/0I3L3I2s0G12\n. @jenius we need to find a way to add a gif in here. No demo page is ever complete without a gif.\n\n. NOOOOO!!! LMAO\n. Just pushed a basic example page: http://carlsednaoui.github.io/ouibounce/\nWe can revise later with an awesome-er design :)\n. Hey travis, small world\u00a0\u2014 I'm a big fan of pineapple.io (I created http://coursebacon.com/ way back when I was learning rails!).\nI'm not sure I understand what you're trying to achieve \u2014 why would you call ouibouce on false? If you're trying to show a modal using ouibounce you def need to select an element (which ouibounce will then show).\nAll you're getting with ouibounce is the trigger \u2014 based on the mouseout event. You have full control over what happens on exit (which element you show, etc).\n. Ohh, I see. That's a neat use case!\nNot sure if there's an easy way to add that in right now but pull requests are always welcome :)\n@jenius: any ideas on this?\n. Thanks for the heads up \u2014\u00a0that's a problem. Just opened up a new issue for it :+1: \n. @9mm, just added this \u2014 let me know if it works for you. (I also updated the README :)\n. @9mm, does the code in https://github.com/carlsednaoui/ouibounce/compare/ie8 fix the ie8 bug? I'll find a way to test locally in the coming days.\n. Thanks for the review @9mm.\nGood call @jenius, I really don't want to deal with legacy stuff. Will add the es5-shims to the README.\n. Re-opening. @jenius wanna pair on this when I'm back Stateside? :hamburger: \n. Would this PR address this? https://github.com/carlsednaoui/ouibounce/pull/20\n@mcgwebdesign is trying to write tests for it.\nLet me know!\n. No worries at all :)\nClosing this issue for now \u2014 feel free to re-open if needed.\n. PR submitted with https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/3170\n. @Rendez the build is failing, likely due to the typo identified by @jenius: https://travis-ci.org/carlsednaoui/ouibounce/builds/25087625\nAlso, could you edit the README to document what you're adding?\n. Thanks @Rendez! Loved the detailed README addition :)\nQuick note, I committed af4938703f7e33fd359b5e8d678f90de8dff74c3 \u2014 I believe ';domain=' was missing.\nLet me know if you find any errors.\nThanks!\n. :+1: :)\n. @jenius for sure. This issue is can only happen after #29 is completed :)\n. :lollipop: \n. Just submitted to unheap \u2014\u00a0they'll tweet once it's live :)\n. :heart: \n. Thanks @s16h, we can look into mouseleave and update the code if makes sense. I think this issue addresses something similar to what you're mentioning: https://github.com/carlsednaoui/ouibounce/issues/26 but we didn't look into mouseleave at the time.\nHave you have a chance to run the script with mouseleave on your end? Does this solve the problem?\n/cc: @bergerjac \n. This is great @bergerjac! Here's another way to test:\nMouseout    \njs\n$('body').on('mouseout', function(e) {console.log('out')});\nMouseleave    \njs\n$('body').on('mouseleave', function(e) {console.log('leave')});\nWant to submit a PR?\n. Closed with #45 \n. Hi @simevidas by window breakpoint I mean \"the window edge\". That's where the website's content ends and the URL bar starts.\nThe modal is triggered whenever the user is trying to leave your website \u2014\u00a0when she/ he moves the mouse pass the window breakpoint (to close the tab, change the URL, etc).\nLet me know if that clarifies your question!\n. Thanks @simevidas, I just clarified the README: https://github.com/carlsednaoui/ouibounce#sensitivity\n. Interesting concept. Want to give this a shot @simevidas and submit a PR?\n. @simevidas thoughts on this: https://github.com/carlsednaoui/ouibounce/tree/reEnter?\n. @simevidas feel free to review when you have time. I'm closing this issue for now \u2014\u00a0happy to re-open when / if needed.\n. Bad idea. Closing.\n. Closed with #44 \n. I think that's because something is overriding jQuery's $.\n\nThese two should be the same:\n\nLike in here:\n\nOne way to fix this would be to change $('body').on('click', function() { to jQuery('body').on('click', function() { but you should probably get a developer to look at your code and understand where and why jQuery's $ is getting overridden.\nClosing this issue. Hopefully this helps.\n. Awesome, thank you @dz0ny. Will add package to registry.\n. Love it! Thanks @bergerjac :smiley: \n. https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/3894\n. Not sure how to make it work without interrupting the user flow. If they're not tapping they're likely reading or away (therefore defeating the purpose of a modal).\nUnfortunately, I don't there's an elegant solution for this :(\n. Closing this for now.\n. Example 2 in the README has the wrong ouibounce version, my bad \u2014\u00a0will open an issue to update it.\nTry the same thing here: http://carlsednaoui.github.io/ouibounce/ you shouldn't face this problem.\nClosing for now, please re-open if http://carlsednaoui.github.io/ouibounce/ has the issue you're describing.\n. Thanks @zaus! I just re-opened the issue. I'll try to replicate this bug on my end (maybe with different browsers?).\nWould you be able to submit a pull-request trying to fix this?\n. Ahhh, I'm trying to replicate this behavior @zaus and can't do it!\n@jenius are you able to replicate this issue on your machine?\n. :alien: \n. Could someone please share a live URL where this is happening?\n. Thanks so much for the demo, this is infuriating!\nLook what happens on my machine (it all works as expected):\n\nIf you implement this version/ release does this still happen? Wondering if there's something to the mouseout v.s. mouseleave that we recently implemented.\nLet me know and happy weekend! \n. Hmmm so weird, I'll try to play around by tracking the mouse movement and only trigger is the mouse is going up.\nMy schedule is booked for the next week or so \u2014 I'll take a look as soon as I can.\n@colinodell, if you have time, let me know if implementing mouse movement solves this \u2014 we can just add another conditional before firing the event.\n. Thanks @colinodell! Branch merged.\n@zaus, let me know if the problem persists.\nClosing this issue for now (and hopefully for ever :smile:)\n. Updated!\n. Hi @AmandaMT, the sitewide: true option should be doing this for you. Can you share the website this is implemented on?\n. @AmandaMT did you try turning aggressive off? You can simply remove that line.\nAlso, your code is throwing an error, you might want to have a dev look at it:\n\n. @AmandaMT glad I was able to help :)\n. Thanks @zaus!\nI just implemented the toUTCString change (good call on this, didn't know it was deprecated).\nPreventing the event trigger should have been solved in #55 \u2014\u00a0let me know if this doesn't work for you.\nClosing for now \u2014\u00a0thank you again for submitting the PR!!\n:smile: :fries: :hamburger: \n. Thanks for the suggestions @zaus.\nBy default, OuiBounce uses a session cookie, so we should be good. The overhead is a good point, but it's so small that I'd rather keep the code smaller / cleaner v.s. saving a few cycles of calculation.\nI'll close this issue for now.\n. Hmm, just took a look. It's probably a CSS issue.\nMake sure that .modal has display: block;.\n\n. You're welcome :)\n. @pjrvs the example page has this behavior. As @jenius said, this is something that would need to be implemented on your end.\nHere's how I implemented this:\n``` js\n     Example page JS        \n Used to fire the modal \n",

Just my 2 cents, although I'm sure @carlsednaoui will have good answers to this:\n1. UMD ensures support for a variety of different javascript module loaders such a requirejs and browserify, among others. Loading your javascript as modules rather than attaching everything directly to window offers a number of advantages for JS development. To find out more here, I'd suggest poking around for article on the advantages of requirejs and/or browserify to lead you in the right direction. Some examples here. In general, using javascript modules is something attractive to more advanced javascript developers, but the benefit of UMD is that it makes this script compatible with everything, whether you are using it as a module or just loading it as a script tag.\n2. Because we are measuring when the mouse has exited the window, not when it has moved in any way. It would be very obnoxious if a popup appeared whenever you moved your mouse.\n3. This is wonderful that you are interested in contributing! A couple quick notes here. First, you can find information on setting up the build in the contributing.md file. This is a standard on github, which is nice because you can often find this file in repos when you are interested in contributing. Second, I'm not sure having the event fire when you leave the window in any direction is something that we'd want to pull in to the library. The intent of ouibounce is to have the event fire before the user is about to leave the page by closing the window/tab. If you move your mouse out on the side or bottom of the window, it's unlikely that you are moving to close the tab, which is at the top of the window, and more likely that maybe you are going to check something else, but staying on the page, so it would be inappropriate to have the popup appear then.\nHope this helps!\n. For point 2, I'll defer to @carlsednaoui to explain this. However, I promise you that using mouseMove would not be the correct way to handle this, as that particular event would fire whenever the mouse moved anywhere on the page, rather than when it moves outside the page. Not only is this much heavier polling, it would also produce false positives when the user moved their mouse upwards anywhere on the page. Feel free to fork the project and experiment around with these things, but you will find that it does indeed work as intended in the current state.\n3) I may be mistaken, but I think our philosophy here was to edge on the side of being ok with occasional rare events when the event doesn't fire if the user leaves (by taking some weird route out the side of the browser then looping back up to the top without entering the window again), than to have it frequently fire when the user is not going to leave. I suppose in technical terms this would be preferring false negatives over false positives. Perhaps @carlsednaoui will disagree with me here, but my opinion on this issue would be that if you want to make that change you'd have to fork it, and that it would not be pulled in here. Although you are welcome to do so, that's what open source is all about!\n. I hope that people don't agree with a more aggressive option, for the good of your users!\n. :+1:\n. Woah what happened with all these commit refs!\n. hah, thats crazy. welp nobody will see it anyway right? :cookie: \n. > \"French Presidential Nominee Sednaoui Force Pushes Code On Github, Faces Public Shame\"\n. Also, if you find that you users frequently wait more than 1s after getting to a site to move their mouse into the window, you can always adjust the delay time to be higher:\nhttps://github.com/carlsednaoui/ouibounce#set-a-min-time-before-ouibounce-fires\n. That's a very good point, I hadn't thought of that. The primary use-case @dtdw is talking about here being, I assume, when a user clicks a link to open in a background tab (which I do all the time honestly), but by the time they get there the delay has run and the popup appears on entry.\nI'm sure there's a way we can fix this. For example, if that event fires once on entry and once on exit, we could always just record the first fire and only actually trigger the modal on the second, etc.\n. :+1: \n. 100% let's get it :boom: \n. :lipstick: \n. Oh noes what happened to the pattern! Add the sketch file somewhere and I'll pull down and contribute some cleanup? :grinning: \n. Shop? This is an outrage. Recreating in sketch.\n\n. Maybe something like this would help: https://github.com/WebReflection/ie8\n. Oh yeah IE8 doesnt support array.reduce haha. You probably just want to use an es5 shim with this library like this one: https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim\nUnless you want to worry about legacy js engines @carlsednaoui I might add a note that you'll need an es5 shim if you're running on ie8 or earlier to the readme?\n. Cool, looks like potentially adding the event shim to the caveats as well might help. As these shims continue rolling in, it might be worth it for us to add a new build file called shims or something that rolls them all into one place, but that the user can choose to include or not at their own discretion.\n. Sure, just let me know!\n. Hey @Rendez, could you add a description to your PR to explain what you did here and why?\n. you mean after the designz are done right?\n. Haha :+1: \njs\n{\n  \"dependencies\":\n    \"design\": \"git@github.com/carlsednaoui/ouibounce/issues/29\"\n}\n. Ah shoot, I feel like this needs a bit more polish before it's ready for unheap - hopefully they accept it anyway! Will submit a PR to make some small tweaks when I can :sparkling_heart: \n. :+1: \n. I'm good with this - I think this would mean moving the callback into an object so that there could be two, one for leave and one for re-enter. Since ouibounce doesn't decide what actually happens, and only fires these events, it would be up to the user to reverse the behavior on re-entry.\n. can't you do both?\n. Also, for npm this is just matter of changing main in package.json to point to build/ouibounce.js, that will be a good quick one. Might be a good pull request too :wink: \n. :+1: \n. lgtm :+1: \n. Oooh that's interesting. You might be able to stop this by messing around a little with the bubbling with something like e.stopPropagation\n. Can't replicate either\n. Perhaps it has to do with windows? I know both me and @carlsednaoui are on macs...\n. Ok so I guess I'm going to be the one to point out here that your cursor is a small wizard? :laughing: \n. Is there any use case for this other than a temporary workaround for #48?\n. Hi @pjrvs!\nOuibounce won't do this automatically, it's only responsible for detecting and firing the event when the user is about to leave. The modal logic is on you to code :grinning: \nThe good news is that you can actually make this happen yourself fairly easily, just attach a click event handler to the body element that fires the modal close event. If you want to prevent the event bubbling from also closing the modal when you click anywhere inside the modal, you can attach a second click handler to the modal that calls stopPropagation.\n. You're just talking about in the example, right? The plugin itself does not come with a form.\n. Yeah I've gotta side with @carlsednaoui here and say this isn't a feature I'd be comfortable including. But that's what open source is all about, you are welcome to fork it into your own version that does include this feature!\n. @neils1 that method seems like it would generate a lot of false positives. I think one of the goals of ouibounce is to generate very few or no false positives. Popups are annoying, especially if they come up seemingly randomly. I would go no on that idea, although I must admit it is very creative!\n. I feel like this opens up opportunities to turn this into crappy spam. Nobody wants to get a popup when they are in the middle of scrolling down a page, it's just annoying and makes for a poor experience.\nIt also is not in line with the purpose of this plugin, which is to trigger an event when someone is about to leave a page -- that turns it into trigger an event at a couple of arbitrary times that you might want to trigger popups. If we accept that as a feature, what justification would we have to say \"no\" to someone who asked for an option to trigger a popup when the user mouses over a specific element? Or after a specific amount of time on the page?\n. Ohh yeah I totally did not. In that case I agree haha sorry!\nBut the caveat here is that you have to bind to window.scroll which is kind of a slow thing to do so be careful, that can really choke the javascript up. Might want to add a warning about it in the docs that it could slow down your page, and definitely remove the listener after the scroll point was hit.\nCould also listen for mouse movement on the page.\n. I think it's fine as an option in this script, as long as it's off by default!\n. :+1: \n. This looks ready for merge, let's just squash those last 2 commits\n. Updated and ready to roll :camel: \n. :whale: \n. :tada: \n. This is an interesting prospect. I feel like maybe the default should actually be session unless days are specified?

Oh noes what happened to the pattern! Add the sketch file somewhere and I'll pull down and contribute some cleanup? :grinning: \n. Shop? This is an outrage. Recreating in sketch.\n\n. Maybe something like this would help: https://github.com/WebReflection/ie8\n. Oh yeah IE8 doesnt support array.reduce haha. You probably just want to use an es5 shim with this library like this one: https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim\nUnless you want to worry about legacy js engines @carlsednaoui I might add a note that you'll need an es5 shim if you're running on ie8 or earlier to the readme?\n. Cool, looks like potentially adding the event shim to the caveats as well might help. As these shims continue rolling in, it might be worth it for us to add a new build file called shims or something that rolls them all into one place, but that the user can choose to include or not at their own discretion.\n. Sure, just let me know!\n. Hey @Rendez, could you add a description to your PR to explain what you did here and why?\n. you mean after the designz are done right?\n. Haha :+1: \njs\n{\n  \"dependencies\":\n    \"design\": \"git@github.com/carlsednaoui/ouibounce/issues/29\"\n}\n. Ah shoot, I feel like this needs a bit more polish before it's ready for unheap - hopefully they accept it anyway! Will submit a PR to make some small tweaks when I can :sparkling_heart: \n. :+1: \n. I'm good with this - I think this would mean moving the callback into an object so that there could be two, one for leave and one for re-enter. Since ouibounce doesn't decide what actually happens, and only fires these events, it would be up to the user to reverse the behavior on re-entry.\n. can't you do both?\n. Also, for npm this is just matter of changing main in package.json to point to build/ouibounce.js, that will be a good quick one. Might be a good pull request too :wink: \n. :+1: \n. lgtm :+1: \n. Oooh that's interesting. You might be able to stop this by messing around a little with the bubbling with something like e.stopPropagation\n. Can't replicate either\n. Perhaps it has to do with windows? I know both me and @carlsednaoui are on macs...\n. Ok so I guess I'm going to be the one to point out here that your cursor is a small wizard? :laughing: \n. Is there any use case for this other than a temporary workaround for #48?\n. Hi @pjrvs!\nOuibounce won't do this automatically, it's only responsible for detecting and firing the event when the user is about to leave. The modal logic is on you to code :grinning: \nThe good news is that you can actually make this happen yourself fairly easily, just attach a click event handler to the body element that fires the modal close event. If you want to prevent the event bubbling from also closing the modal when you click anywhere inside the modal, you can attach a second click handler to the modal that calls stopPropagation.\n. You're just talking about in the example, right? The plugin itself does not come with a form.\n. Yeah I've gotta side with @carlsednaoui here and say this isn't a feature I'd be comfortable including. But that's what open source is all about, you are welcome to fork it into your own version that does include this feature!\n. @neils1 that method seems like it would generate a lot of false positives. I think one of the goals of ouibounce is to generate very few or no false positives. Popups are annoying, especially if they come up seemingly randomly. I would go no on that idea, although I must admit it is very creative!\n. I feel like this opens up opportunities to turn this into crappy spam. Nobody wants to get a popup when they are in the middle of scrolling down a page, it's just annoying and makes for a poor experience.\nIt also is not in line with the purpose of this plugin, which is to trigger an event when someone is about to leave a page -- that turns it into trigger an event at a couple of arbitrary times that you might want to trigger popups. If we accept that as a feature, what justification would we have to say \"no\" to someone who asked for an option to trigger a popup when the user mouses over a specific element? Or after a specific amount of time on the page?\n. Ohh yeah I totally did not. In that case I agree haha sorry!\nBut the caveat here is that you have to bind to window.scroll which is kind of a slow thing to do so be careful, that can really choke the javascript up. Might want to add a warning about it in the docs that it could slow down your page, and definitely remove the listener after the scroll point was hit.\nCould also listen for mouse movement on the page.\n. I think it's fine as an option in this script, as long as it's off by default!\n. ",

    "sebastien-fauvel": "Hi Carl,\nthanks for looking into it! I had already read about your concerns in the original issue, and I think I've addressed them, at least on clients with a mouse/trackpad, by aborting the delayed firing whenever the mouse moves on the page. If you scroll to reach the navigation bar and go to another section, you will probably move the mouse pointer before the end of the firing delay \u2013 at least if you have a sensible one, say, 500ms? On smartphones & tablets, though, you will only have a mousemove event whenever you click the navigation menu. With a firing delay of, say, 2 seconds, we could avoid firing too early, too. What do you think? Should we add a separate configuration variable delayScroll with a reasonable default (2000ms) to handle that, or some configuration flag trackScroll set to false by default? Would it make sense to you? I mean, your current solution (firing when the mouse leaves the page, aborting when it moves onto the page again) is not perfect either, it only works fine when the firing delay is adjusted properly \u2013 because you also cross the top of the page with the mouse from time to time when you want to use the navigation menu. Isn't this quite the same issue? Also I thought you wanted to implement an open-source replacement for BounceExchange, and they do track scrolling, too...\nAnyway, let me know what you think \u2013 I'll start a sister project if you want to drop this feature at all costs :)\n.
