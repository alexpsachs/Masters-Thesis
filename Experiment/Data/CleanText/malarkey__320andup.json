Hi @JairusKhan \u2014 That's awesome that you did this.\nWe actually already had an official Sass version in the works (which is now added to the official repository). Please feel free to check that out (and add contribute any feedback/edits if you have any) to those versions.\nThanks so much!\n. Hey Andy, were there any issues with this?\nAlso I noticed someone else submitted a SCSS + Compass version, but I already have that included here\u2026 in case you're confused if what he did is different. :)\n. Hrm. Do you mind giving me temporary access to the repository and then I can try to help you manually merge it in? I won't touch any of your less files or main files; I'll just be adding my new ones in.\n. :+1:\n. Oh, wow, great catch! All fixed now, thanks!\n. No, OCD is good! :)\n. - Agreed on the reordering (makes total sense).\n- As for the shorthand values, that depends. I think the intent of this mixin is created to allow you to pass anything in here (maybe you have something totally different in each corner\u2026), and this way seems to try to have better compatibility. But if we're not caring about certain browser versions (like Firefox 3.6), maybe that doesn't matter. @malarkey \u2014\u00a0thoughts?\n- Agreed that the commas are a bit weird.\n. I want to see what @malarkey thinks on this before I make any changes, just in case he had a particular reason for doing it this way. :)\n. Hey, I liked indenting even before I used Sass! :-D\nI have to admit, for nested classes, it's trickier in the LESS files to see where the nesting begins and ends due to the lack of indention \u2014 but it's nothing a reformat can't fix. :)\n. For LESS, .clearfix { @include clearfix; } is not necessary because the .clearfix mixin already exists, which behaves as a class as well.\nFor the Sass files, I added that line as a convenience in the Compass versions of the files because in Sass, mixins do not equal classes, and I noticed Andy's templates use a clearfix class in the markup. I figured it'd be helpful, but it was not really necessary.\nI can add those in the other Sass files, too, if it helps, but my preference would be to lose the class all together and rely on extended placeholder selectors. :)\n. Makes sense. I'll add them once I get a chance. Thanks! :-)\n. I believe you are looking in the Compass versions, in which +rounded is not necessary because +border-radius already exists in Compass. :)\n. Hrm, okay I will look into that. When I noticed Andy was calling out a particular corner rather than all corners, I opted for Compass'es mixins instead of Andy's so it'd be less repetitive code. Perhaps I accidentally ported some of that over to the non-Compass files. Will fix once I get a chance to look at it. Thanks!\n. Hi @chrisdl \u2014 is this change needed? The current ordering matches the ordering below, and the clockwise ordering that is commonly used in CSS, but I'm happy to hear your thoughts on why it should be changed. :)\n. Oh, whoops, I misread this. It's actually in the right order. Guess the ones below should be reordered. :) My bad.\n. ",

Perhaps index.html could have the protocol prefix, while example.html could be without?\nOR clearly indicate to the user that the pages are setup to be served by a web server (and may require tweaking otherwise).\nOR we could use http instead of https (which should get us around the \"secure/unsecure content\" browser warning - I did a quick check and that seems fine for Chrome, but would be worth checking in other browsers as well, of course.\nThoughts?

This is not a standard thing. Am I missing something here?\nApart from that I wonder if it's necessary to include the webkit- and moz-prefixed version of this property at all or if it could rater be dropped. border-radius in its unprefixed version is supported in every major browser on desktop and mobile. Only browser to slightly worry about should be Firefox 3.6.\nI guess the support for this is a whole other discussion.\nMy suggestion for this PR is to fix the mixin's output before merging.\n. I guess you're right with \"why not support them\". It's mostly two loc and that's totally acceptable.\nApart from that combining the webkit-prefixed properties feels better for me.\n. Well, this seems to be an issue in Safari 4. I wouldn't care too much about this version. I mean there are not that much users for Safari 4 anymore (4.0: 0.22%, 4.1: 0.16% according to StatsCounter) and border-radius degradates gracefully.\n.

And webkit it only really needed for about 5% of users (safari 4.0 and below).\nI reckon, why not support it? \n. I would combine for webkit but I got scared by this article on webkit for safari needing it specified in non shorthand: http://csswizardry.com/2010/03/a-quick-note-on-border-radius/\n... thoughts? \n. Thanks for all the input. I've learn't a lot about border-radius throughout this discussion.
