I appreciate the tip, but I'm trying to keep Toast as simple to use as possible, and adding a requirement for users to comment all whitespace between grid modules will be painful for them to keep up.\n. Hey there!\nI\u2019m glad you brought this up, because it is something I\u2019ve become aware of as a nagging issue in my mind. The short answer is: I have a new grid system in a CSS file somewhere on my computer. I like it, but I\u2019m scared current Toast users won\u2019t. There are a few issues I want to iron out, and an awful lot of other things going on in my world that are delaying progress. But yes; it\u2019s coming.\nPretty long short answer, right?\nThe long answer is that over the last year or so, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that almost all frameworks are just outright inappropriate and bloated for most if not all projects. Design isn\u2019t something to be rushed or shoehorned; if you can take the time to create a grid system for each project, then you should do. That said, I understand the need for CSS frameworks, and I also understand my responsibility as one of the people who popped up and said \"Hey, I made one of those too!\" to maintain a project like this.\nThe new grid system is highly simplified. We\u2019re talking one fifth, one third, one half grid systems as opposed to \"x-of-twelve\". Bigger columns in favour of smaller units. A brief explanation of the difference between those two is available here. Toast has always been a prototyping tool in my own mind; the next version will hopefully go a little beyond that because of it\u2019s fogginess in grid systems. A less precise grid means users will be more inclined to write their own grids (ideal scenario) or at least stop people from overthinking grids.\nTo summarise, I\u2019m sorry for the delay; the next version is coming. But it\u2019s a big change.\np.s. Here and now would be a good time for people to suggest things they want to see added, changed, or removed.\n. Update; the new version is here!\n. Hi there,\nThis looks like a Jekyll blog. Are you recompiling the files after changing the CSS file name and location?\n. Toast.css is designed to be a base from which to work towards a more customised design. It comes with its own classes and (very) simple styles, but it isn\u2019t a striaght-up replacement for a CSS file.\n. Well spotted. Thanks!\n. Normalize throws out the baseline because it comes with its own margins, line-heights, and other spacing factors. If I were you, I'd try including normalize before Toast, or removing the conflicting CSS from either normalize or Toast as required.\n. Solved in 82f2738d68bb700fb5aa187d715afcaf98fee83e\n. @iamvery Toast has changed a lot since this was opened! Now, the only thing in here is the grid. It's a bring-your-own-everything-except-layout framework :)\n. I'm not sure I follow. Would you mind making a gist to demonstrate the problem you're experiencing?\n. Gotcha. You can nest grids by putting the columns in a nested .grid:\nhttps://gist.github.com/daneden/8956845\n. Mostly for simplicity\u2019s sake.
