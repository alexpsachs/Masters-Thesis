Yes, it is possible :)\n. The problem with the validator is that we are only allowed 1 scan per second and the public scan could potentially have more.

The compatibility list is used in plugin-free because for reliability reasons. There is already a list of websites IE knows require plugins so we do the check against it. If it passes then we try to figure out if there is a plugin in the page. Plugins can be created dynamically via JS and we cannot detect that so we need to use that list.\n.

Unfortunately https://github.com/mikeal/request doesn't support that type of urls so we cannot fix this\n. We'll do the change in our side then\n. Fixed in Next\n. I don't know exactly how we should do this. For detection SPA in general I would go for the second options and look for # o #!. We could also add a check for know libraries for SPA like Angular.\n\nThe problem is how to flag this. Should the tests be aware if they are analyzing a SPA and not throw any error or should we just run an extra test saying if it is a SPA and then the UI will take care of that? Shouldn't we then give more information to the UI as to what test don't apply to SPA?\nI think I would go for:\n- Adding a test call SPA or something similar\n- Add an extra field to the test that do not apply for SPA. Maybe if we want to do it in a generic way this could be the name of the test they depend on so the UI knows if it should ignore this test or not. Maybe something like:\nappliesIf: ['spa:false']\nWhat do you think? Maybe I'm complicating things too much...\n. That is why we also check for # and #! in the links.\nI said Angular just as an example but there are many other libraries that are only meant for SPA. Also if you have any pattern that will help us recognize SPA please share it with us :)\n. After talking with @vlaine we figured out the problem was related to issue #26 \nTo solve this particular issue we need to support a proxy to access external resources. Closing this and opening issue #32 for better tracking\n. This has been fixed by @naokikimura :)\n. I think that a search for roletype or any of the aria attributes should be ok for this tests, at least for a first version and start the conversation.\nWhat do you think?\n. We are already checking for the most common libraries, maybe we can do\nsomething and assume if jQuery UI is present (or any other that supports\naria) then it is OK. I guess the order will be HTML search > JS libraries >\nwarning\nOn Fri, Jan 17, 2014 at 12:39 PM, Dave Methvin notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nWould a warning be given if we didn't find any aria attributes?

So the current version in vNext detects the Aria tags only, I've done a bit of research and I've found this post from 2009 about libraries that support Aria: http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2009/07/wai-aria-implementation-in-javascript-ui-libraries/\n\n@dmethvin  should we try the library detection even though they might not be using those controls? We should also try to update the list of libraries.\n. If it is something more or less stable then I would push to vNext, if it is testing then I would create another branch :)\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"Dave Methvin\" notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e1/\u200e22/\u200e2014 20:07\nTo: \"InternetExplorer/modern.IE-static-code-scan\" modern.IE-static-code-scan@noreply.github.com\nCc: \"Anton Molleda\" amolleda@gmail.com\nSubject: Re: [modern.IE-static-code-scan] Accessibility: Detect use of ARIAtags (#34)\nI'd be interested in seeing what this generates on a few sites.

Should I do updates in vNext?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. The problem with #22 is that we don't know if it is going to hit the main website. Also if you are in an intranet you don't want to send your HTML to an external webservice (and I haven't found any HTML validator in JS).\nI think we should implement this ourselves. Maybe we can assume that if the image is a gif (even a png?) then it doesn't need to have an alt?\nAnother alternative is to download all the images of the website, get their sizes and do another guess, but that is going to slow down the process a lot and I'm not sure it is worth it.\n. OK, looking at the tags is easy and I have it working locally.\nThe problem with Perl is making it work on Azure. The scanner uses azure\nwebsites but that most likely will not work so we will have to use a\ncloudapp. I tried to make the validator locally with IIS but couldn't\nfigure how to make it work, the only windows instructions are for Apache\nand there were several modules and dependencies to install manually :S\nOn Fri, Jan 17, 2014 at 12:35 PM, Dave Methvin notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nTechnically we should be able to run the validator locally, it looks to be\nwritten in Perl and the license is permissive.

Implemented in vNext\n. Actually #7 is already fixed in vNext. We have the parser used in CSSLint working now :)\nI think that most of the accessibility issues with hover are done via JS. We could:\n- Look for common menu libraries that we know have issues with hover and then highlight those automatically (we should be able to use some RegEx for that)\n- Try to identify the patterns for hover. Maybe we can start with some like $().hover() (and the mouse ones) and depending of the amount of code in the handlers do our best guess? Don't think we will be able to do something like this easily via regex so maybe we will need to add something like ESLint?\n. I added ESLint support in a local branch a while ago (in the 0.1.0 times).\nI don't think it will take too long to update it. The only problem is that\nit is not stable yet and they are doing quite a few changes every day...\nMaybe we can start with the regex and then migrate to ESLint once they lock\ntheir API and make it more robust?\n\nOn Fri, Jan 17, 2014 at 12:43 PM, Dave Methvin notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nHmm, this just might work.

I don't think I have an ETA for the next deployment :-/\nI don't think the format changed from the previous version so it shouldn't be breaking (unless having new tests is the root of the problem). Can you make a diff from the 2 versions? \n. This is the expected behavior. Updates because of patches are \"safer\" and do not include new features so the possibility of breaking changes is smaller.\n. This should be fixed now. Took a look with @dstorey and remove a bunch.

    "scheblein": "Any luck on integrating NTLM?\n. Yes, this is definitely something I'm looking for. I work for a large company with several thousands of internal websites. IE is the default browser and we limp by with compatibility view enabled for intranet zone. That doesn't seem to be working anymore with IE11. I want to run this tool on a known list of internal websites to check for IE11 compatibility. We then can focus resources on the ones which fail hardest, rather than having to functionally test thousands of websites. Most everything is authenticated via NTLM, if not Kerberos.\n. Still getting a timeout message after deleting those two .js files you referenced. I'm also behind a corporate firewall and can't send any internal data outside the firewall.\n. Looking at Wireshark, now it's looking for:\ncds171.sea9.msecn.net\n. With your note, I realized that check-pluginfree.js was the check that was still trying to go external. cds171.sea9.msecn.net must be a server for the IE compatibility list. It was interesting to see that check-pluginfree.js used the compatibility list.\nBecause i figure being plugin free is important, i went ahead and downloaded the two versions of compatibility lists, stored them locally on the node.js server, lo and behold, everything is working now except check-image-compression.js (which i don't need anyway). I wonder why check-pluginfree.js is using the IE compatibility list? \nIf a version of check-pluginfree.js could be forked that doesn't use the IE compatibility list, I'd be happy to test it. \n. ",
    "dmethvin": "Spent some time debugging this issue with Manish Kumar Sharma. It looks to me that the NTLM support could be just one of the hurdles we're facing. His IT-managed system seems to be blocking these requests, they are getting a 502 when we try to monitor via Fiddler. It might be helpful to create a testbed inside Microsoft that uses the company VPN setup to see exactly what needs to be configured. I also wonder if we could just use some sort of COM-driven proxy based on IE that could relay the requests, rather than trying to reimplement all the NTLM and honoring of proxy settings inside node.\n. Interesting idea.Would it be possible maybe to use the MHTML format that IE uses when you use \"File/Save as/Web Archive (single file)\" perhaps? That would automagically fix all the URL references inside the HTML and CSS files so we could just unpack and scan them. Not sure if there's an existing MHT file reader for node. \n. Given the amount of work required on the developer's part (either manual or via a build process) this is not something we should bug people about.\n. Do you mean we should look for script that is loaded by injecting <script> tags after the document is ready? Perhaps these could be detected with [mutation observers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn265032(v=vs.85).aspx) which are supported in IE11 but the static code scan does not run the scripts.\nOr do you mean, \"check that code follows the best practice of putting script tags at the end of the body\"? That is a good general practice, but there are exceptions so we'd need to determine whether giving this message would cause more confusion than help.\n. I think it would be hard to do this. The iecompat scan could do it easier\nsince it runs the code. But like you say we would need to identify all the\ntracking scripts which would be a big job.\nOn Nov 29, 2013 4:10 PM, \"Anton Molleda\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@dmethvin https://github.com/dmethvin what do you think? Should we add\nthis test? Should we flag script tags at the beginning that are for\ntracking purposes?

Looking at this, I am thinking we could warn about scripts that are included before the CSS in the head, or excessive numbers of scripts included in the head. I'll take a look at some possibilities. This will require some extra sections in the report.\n. Note to self, we should look for async attributes and not warn about those being ahead of CSS, see https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/20/script-injected-async-scripts-considered-harmful/ for examples of when it's useful.\n. Hmmm, okay, then it probably needs to be investigated further. The only way this should have happened is if the person was using local copies of the scripts, and I don't know if they were.\n. I'm not sure how our Azure server is configured, but could we host the validator on some other box and then call it privately? Or does that just push the problem somewhere else?\n. I've added a unit test here but haven't changed anything in the detection. The test \"passes\" but since not all of the features are detected you get a warning. I can think of at least two ways to handle this. \n- Have the front-end report not warn if any of the three are present, since there is at least some indication the author knows what they are doing. In this case there is already a DNS prefetch.\n- Detect if the page has links other than fragments, only warn if $(\"a\").not(\"[href^='#']\") has something. Add a new singlePageApp flag to the results so we can tweak this detection as needed without changes to the front-end.\n\n@molant what are your thoughts?\n. I think it depends on how fancy our detects get. For now the only one that I think we need to avoid a warning with is this one.\nI like the idea of some type of global flags, because we could either detect them once in the scanner or have these be passed in from the UI for other things if we wanted. So in the future we might want a \"I don't care about IE6/7/8 compatibility\" flag for example.\n. We have a way to run the code already, with the Sauce Labs scan that you can run. It injects Compat Inspector into the page and spins up a Sauce instance to run it. I'm on a plane and the SW toolbar injection is hosing modern.IE, but I think it's called something like \"Check for features no longer supported by Modern.IE\" in a tab once you've finished the regular scan. It could be better exposed.\nEven with that scan, however, we are just letting the app/page spin up and fire window.onload, then waiting a few more seconds and ajaxing back the results of our hooks on various behaviors. It's much more difficult to drive the app in a way that creates meaningful interactions.  Someone who really wanted to do that for a page/project should look into Browserswarm.com, since it's more like app-specific unit or functional tests. \nJust a warning about trying to build further advice based on these two scans. Developers (me included) tend to be somewhat OCD and don't want to see \"warnings\" or even \"notes\" that they think are misguided for their needs. That's what this ticket is about, but more opinionated tips  like \"you have 'too many' DOM elements in your page\" are probably going to anger and annoy someone who needs that many elements and has worked to reduce their impacts. \nI'd be glad to leave this as-is and say that SPAs are outside the scope of what we're trying to do, thus not all the advice may apply. I had just hoped we could find some simple proxy for many SPAs to reduce irrelevant advice for those situations.\n. As far as doing this for specific tips, I don't think it's practical. The color is orange meaning \"suggested enhancement\" and not an error. \nI think a better solution for this is to add more granularity about the advice and a way to opt out of particular advice, but that is a general feature and I'lve opened #29 for it.\n. Would a warning be given if we didn't find any aria attributes? That could give a lot of false positives. For example, most of the jQuery UI widgets support aria and will insert them when the markup is enhanced at runtime. But you wouldn't see that in a static scan.\n. I'd be interested in seeing what this generates on a few sites. I have a feeling we will see a lot of noise so we may want to reorganize the output somehow. \nWe should definitely take another look at the libraries. Should I do updates in vNext?\n. Reward for the work seems low. We would only be able to detect videos embedded in markup via HTML5 tag. Many if not most videos are embedded dynamically since they often want to only fallback to HTML5 if a more robust Flash player isn't available.\n. Technically we should be able to run the validator locally, it looks to be written in Perl and the license is permissive. :smiley_cat: We'd still have the issue of filtering and formatting the output though, and if we just want to look for ALT tags it's overkill.\nReally, according to the W3C all image tags should have an ALT. If it's just decoration and not content then it should be specified as a background in CSS. So we shouldn't need to download any of the images, just look at the tags.\n. Hmm, this just might work. I think we should explore a regex solution even though it might not catch everything, just because it could be done quickly and the ESLint one would be a much bigger step. If we're going ESLint, though, it does give us a huge amount of functionality.\nI'm thinking we could just look for something like /[\"'](hover|mouseenter|mouseover)[\"']/ and warn that whatever they're trying to do with mouse pointer actions won't be visible to touch users.\n. There are a lot of places where it would be perfectly valid to have :hover styles but the page could still be very touch friendly. A message about this runs the risk of being very noisy for no reason and annoying the people who use the scan.\n. Well I can say I've never seen a page like that, ever. It does seem to be in Edge mode. The page is being served with doctype \"image/svg+xml\". It's definitely not a case the scanner is designed to detect, it's mainly intended to find bad HTML practices in older versions of IE that might prevent good operation in IE11. I tried seeing what older versions of IE did with the site but they don't seem to like the URL there because of the non-ASCII characters, even in punycode. \n. Agreed on your proposed resolution. I think we should just let people know it's not the use case for which the tool was designed and leave it at that. \n. Landed a fix in vNext at 456e52d1e972688dca8c10c4487e53664dbf8408 , and decided to simply pass the test since its a pretty unusual edge case.\n. What site did you try to scan?\n. The scan seems to work for me, are you still seeing the problem?\n\n. Oh, the local scan. Most likely the local scan needs to be updated, I'll look into it. You should be able to scan your site fine from http://modern.ie in the meantime, and that scan will be more up to date.\n. @molant it looks like master has been synced with vNext, is that what is deployed to the modern.IE site now?\n. Looks like this has been fixed.\n. These types of micro-optimizations usually don't have much of an impact on performance. Did you have some profiler info showing them to be a perf bottleneck?\n. Looking at this jsperf it seems like the difference between for-loop-basic and for-loop-cached is just a little over 1 percent. That's using Chrome which is probably the closest to node's V8 engine.\n. I think you meant to link to this article? in that article, written in 2011, it also says \"These are micro-optimizations and will only be noticed in performance-critical operations.\" In the jsperf I referenced it says \"Interestingly, it would seem that current 2012 browsers have all optimized their Javascript engines for basic for and while loop syntax. This means we can probably abandon all the 'trick' loops (that used to run faster) and just go with whatever loop syntax we find the most readable.\" I find the current form of most of these loops to be more readable.\n. The syntax is correct either way, since both node.js and JSHint have checked it. It is a question of whether it makes the code better in some way. I think these changes make the code harder to read, and the jsperf above shows that they don't change performance in any useful way.\nPlease do create a different pull request with the hasOwnProperty change, since that is a bug and is not related to the rest of this pull request.\n. We've discussed trying to add some sort of accessibility tool. The Webaim.org site is an interesting scan, but it does generate a pretty scary display for most non-trivial pages. But would it be better to send people there, rather than trying to re-implement it in this scan?\n. See also #35 and #37 for proposed accessibility additions.\n. I think this goes beyond the scope of this particular scanner. Again I think all of these are good ideas and agree completely with your comments about semantic markup. We just want to avoid creating too many judgmental tests.\n. Great bug report! Although IE10 users technically still need the meta tags, they are a shrinking group and cluttering the HTML with meta tags is not such a good idea anyway. I'll take a look at this.\n. This is assigned to an internal tracker since it's not in the scanner code.\n. Is there a reason to use object rather than iframe for embedding HTML? TBH I haven't seen people use object for that so I wonder what you are gaining by  it.\n. Closed due to inactivity, please add feeback if you'd like us to take this further.\n. Are you seeing the same as #40 shows in a screen shot? I am not sure the local scan and server have been completely synced.\n. We can't reproduce here so I think it should be fixed. If you are still seeing a problem, can you click the link on the local scan page and send us the JSON that it is sending to the server?\n. Seems to be working now.\n. This is probably #26\n. This should be fixed in vNext when that lands, see 478ef80a53ffc1f215247b895ed9f1a4b5a938dd and #47. @molant can those be synced soon?\n. Did you npm install?\n. https://github.com/InternetExplorer/modern.IE-static-code-scan#installation-and-configuration\n. It should be fixed by #109, I meant to reference this ticket in the PR.\n.

    "marknoble": "Agreed.  I've updated my site to address the other issues in the test.\nThe failed \"touch\" test doesn't really offer much in the way of direction.\nI've tested my site with a variety of touch-screen devices and have added aria-haspopup=\"true\" where CSS hover is used for a few of the menus.  In my case, tapping on the menu item that has the hover menu just takes you to a page with a more static set of menu options (not relying on hover) so the \"touch\" failure isn't really a failure in my case.\nThe rest of the site seems to work as expected with the default handling of pinching to zoom and scrolling by touch.\n...so I feel that the \"touch\" failure is giving a bad result in my case, but I think this would be corrected if it offered more info about what elements are resulting in that false result so developers can assess impacts of addressing them on their site.\n. > Try to find an heuristic to see if there are hover menus or not.

We can scan for text patterns, evaluate the headers, but not execute the application.\nFor example I setup a test to determine if there were too many DOM elements. Several pages I know are bloated passed the test because they add elements via AJAX. The extra elements were not added in the scan tool because the scripts were not executed.\nI don\u2019t have a lot of nodejs experience, in fact this is just about it, but we need a way to actually execute the application, spa or not. I am looking at using phantomJS, but have more research to do. As I caution my clients, phantom is not an actual browser end users use, so it is not 100% accurate as far as what would actually happen in a real browser. AJAX applications are very dependent on real interactions.\nIf anyone has any ideas let me know. I am very interested in solving this issue.\nChris Love\nFrom: Anton Molleda [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: Wednesday, February 5, 2014 3:06 PM\nTo: InternetExplorer/modern.IE-static-code-scan\nCc: chris love\nSubject: Re: [modern.IE-static-code-scan] Avoid some tips for single-page apps (#29)\nThat is why we also check for # and #! in the links.\nI said Angular just as an example but there are many other libraries that are only meant for SPA. Also if you have any pattern that will help us recognize SPA please share it with us :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/InternetExplorer/modern.IE-static-code-scan/issues/29#issuecomment-34231775.\n. for SPA too many elements is a common issue, they bloat memory footprints and cause css to be sluggish. The test is actually from the YSlow rules, so I don't think too many would justifiably complain.\nBut the bigger point is you really can't provide much insight for modern applications without doing some form of execution. The SauceLabs info is ok, but not thorough enough for me. I tend to push it more than most others :) \n. ",
    "alexandre-works": "Hi guys,\nI am new here, hope I can help and not saying something stupid (I probably will heheh), so I am sorry in advance :)\nI do really have my doubts if Flip ahead browsing and Prerender + prefetch , should ever be more then an alert, independently of the type of the website. This techniques have lots of potencial, but giving an alert with the current copy gives the idea that is something that should be used, and i don't think so. There are so many situations that it doesn't apply (SPA for instance), or is not a good idea. I see now some frameworks using Flip ahead browsing that makes no sense whatsoever!  \nMaybe an alert with a good copy, telling that this technics exist and they can improve the sites in some situations would be enough.   \nI am just \"afraid\" that when we try to push these technics we may do more bad then good.\nPS: At my work i had to explain why i had these alerts on awwwards and why we were not using it! It's a good thing of corse, but sometimes the pressure over the developers, and not well informed develops may start using these without knowing what the hell they are doing.\ncheers\n. Hi,\nProbably  I didn't explain myself properly. I agree with you that for a proper accessibility scan, users should go for instance Webaim.org. Accessibility scan is quite complicated and it would be confuse to implement that here.\nMy point was an example of something that we could get some ideas. We would not be looking for specifics regarding accessibility. The idea was to show somehow how the html was writing, and if had any semantic meaning.\nEX:\n are a block element but no semantic meaning! to have a  instead of a  is diferente, and a screen reader (at least the old ones) would read it differently. and the way that may be translated to an image that somehow shows that if you are or aren't using semantic html.\n1- http://take.ms/XfVy9\nIn here i can have showing in the browser exactly the same design. No problem at all... but they are totally deferent in a semantic way. \n2- http://take.ms/flzzb\nthis is more or less what a screen reader would reed it. Just showing the non semantic way with no spaces, all in the same line, would show that this is not ok.\nI hope I did explain better this time. I am not suggesting at all accessible testing, but I used a specific thing to suggest this idea \nCheers\n. ",
