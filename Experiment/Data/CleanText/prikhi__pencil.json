From dgthanhan on July 03, 2008 00:58:24\nStatus: Accepted\n. From dgthanhan on July 10, 2008 23:34:09\nStatus: Fixed\n.

From phyo.arkarlwin on September 10, 2013 09:45:03\nSeems this project is dead, no update since 2012\n. I wasn't sure if scrollbar referred to an wireframe element or to the Pencil window's actual scrollbar, so I tested this with both.\nWith a vertical scrollbar for the window(caused by having a page height setting that is less than the window's working area height), I couldn't get the scrollbar to disappear by increasing(or decreasing) the Page's height. Same when putting a vertical scrollbar element on a Page.\n. From dgthanhan on July 09, 2008 08:41:23\nThe hyperlink function in richtext component is to make a portion of text to be\nrendered as a hyperlink. And that is all what it do, at least for now.\nI think that we should implement the functionalities you described here as some thing\ncalled 'Interaction behaviour' which defines an action to be invoked when a specific\nevent occurs on an element. This will be applicable on all elements like buttons...\nThe results of this should be that the exported HTML set is navigatible by users by\ninteraction with the elements.\nStatus: Accepted\nOwner: dgthanhan\nLabels: -Type-Defect Type-Enhancement\n. From weedfl...@gmail.com on August 22, 2008 08:47:00\nI concur. To summarize, some of the desired functionality would be:\n1. Insert functional hyperlinks on buttons and in text\n2.

The path in the .ep file for each image ends up being something like \n'../../../../C:/images/image.png'.  For the time being, it may be useful to know that \nyou can manually edit the .ep file xml and replace the image paths with the correct \nrelative path and everything will load fine.\n. From dcan...@gmail.com on October 27, 2009 04:30:17\nHere was my original error text.  The only way I've been able to make it work is to\ndelete all the relative paths and have them all at the same level.\nHello,\n   I'm using Pencil 1.0 build 4 on a WinXp box as a standalone installation.  I've\nbeen doing some mock ups that use a lot of external .png files.  It was working great\nfor awhile.  I had saved and reopened several times with no problems.  Now, all of a\nsudden, it can't seem to find/load the external images.  But there are no error\nmessages thrown.  Here is an example href from the .ep file.\nxlink:href=\"../../../../C:/Program Files/pencil/pictures/solarwhirlud6.jpg\"\nThe strange thing is that if I change the path in the .ep file, now error messages\nstart appearing, but I can't seem to get the external files to appear on the pages. \nHowever, there was one way I got things working again and that was to put the .ep\nfile and the external pics in the same directory and trim everything from the\nreference path:\nxlink:href=\"BLACKBKG.JPG\"\nAny thoughts?  It would be a big pain right now to localize all the references\ninto one directory?\n-Dan\n. From gavinbal...@gmail.com on August 25, 2010 19:11:19\nA quick fix - replace all paths beginning with \"../../../../C:/path/to/file.jpg\" to \"file://C:/path/to/file.jpg\".  That way you avoid having to localise all references to one directory.\n-Gavin\n.

This one will save and be okay when you open the file again. But do not change the name or background on the page after it's been created. If you do, then it will revert to white background again. I'm not sure if this work-around will work with the plug-in but why not try it?\n. From maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com on December 12, 2008 13:40:49\nLabels: Type-Enhancement\n.

Deleting the\nselectedIndex-property or manually changing its value results in proper displaying in\npencil.\nThe tag  has the selectedIndex-property as well with same value, although\nit didn't matter in my tests you might want to pay attention on that as well...\n.

From brownsp...@gmail.com on August 22, 2008 07:14:22\nOk, I have isolated the source of the problem: a bitmap image's path has been\nchanged. It took me a while to notice that an image wasn't displaying, and that I\nrenamed the folder to which that image belongs. The error message was a bit on the\ncryptic side for me to figure out what exactly was happening.\nA friendlier error message might be in order.

From dejong.a...@gmail.com on June 17, 2009 03:17:36\nTechnical details:\nThe problem lies in Pencil.boot() (Pensil.js).\nThis function invokes Pencil.postBoot() (MainWindow.js).\nPencil.postBoot() reads command line parameters and uses a timeout (100ms) to open\nthe specified document.\nHowever, after that Pencil.boot() uses a timeout to create a new empty document using\na timeout (500ms).\nAs a result the command line specified document is opened but a new document is\ncreated afterwards. Since it all happens very fast, the user won't notice.\nAnother problem is when opening a document from command line when a Pencil window is\nalready open. It seems Xulrunner now also passes \"-app\", \"application.ini\" and\n\"-console\" (no clue why), and this ends up in the file path being loaded. Of course\nthis won't load a document.\n.

From rolf.hem...@gmail.com on October 07, 2013 02:44:08\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Download one stencil, the Dojo one is fine.\n2. Try to install it in Pencil 2.05\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe stencil is not installed. It gives \"Error installing collection\". \nA similar error message is known if I try to install an already-installed Template by \"Tools / Manage Export Template\u2026\", button \"Install New Template\u2026\", where it is right. \nHere such error message is not right, as there is no name conflict, if a Stencil is not yet installed, or installed manually.\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nI'm using the standalone version of Pencil 2.05 on Win7 ( I got Firefox 22 installed, with which the Firefox plugin does no work )\nA workaround is to install the stencils manually:\n1. Extract the archives in \u201d/Pencil/Stencils\u201d directory.\n2. For the standolone (xulrunner) version:\nBy example, on win7 by default: \u201d%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Pencil\\Profiles{your-profile-name}\\Pencil\\Stencils\u201d\n3. For the Firefox extension version:\nBy example, on win7 by default: \u201d%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles{your-profile-name}\\Pencil\\Stencils\u201d\n4. Each Stencil has its own a directory in this directory, with a \u201cDefinition.xml\u201d file (and some other optional files).\nBy example:\n\u201d[\u2026]\\Pencil\\Stencils\\ExtJs.GUI_v11\\Definition.xml\u201d.\n\u201d[\u2026]\\Pencil\\Stencils\\ExtJs.GUI_v11\\Icons[\u2026]\u201d.\n.

From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 21:26:11\nThis is not how a Mac works.  Delete on a Mac issues a backspace.  To delete, us Fn+Delete.  This is common across all Mac applications.  Should be closed as not a bug.\n. From asart...@gmail.com on September 25, 2010 02:29:24\nI agree with @dahiensenff. I use a Mac at work and have grown accustomed to using the \"backspace\" (labeled as delete) key when trying to delete elements. This seems to be a fairly common behavior across different applications. When using pencil, I've often found myself hitting the \"backspace\" key for removing elements on the canvas.\n. From lukas.ry...@gmail.com on May 12, 2012 06:29:13\nHi, I've create a fork of Pencil and I've added backspace as shortcut for deleting shapes.

Standard Mac delete behaviour is NOT Fn+Delete (that sounds like Windows to me!). For the Mac it's both Backspace key and/or Del key. i see in v2.0.5 Del key finally works, but it'd be good for the Backspace to also work.\n. dupe of #191\n.

You can download build from Github https://github.com/LukasRychtecky/pencil\n. From sebastiangaul@gmail.com on May 12, 2012 08:56:15\nThis issue is about managing different layers, to be exact about shortcuts for sending an element backward or bringing it forward.\nFor me your added shortcuts aren't important. Quit is fine but rarely used and \"delete\" is more apropriate for \"deleting\" things than backspace, isn't it?\n. From lukas.ry...@gmail.com on May 12, 2012 09:17:48\nYes, I know. But many users don't know about shortcut for sending an element backward or bringing it forward. Because they can't see shortcuts in a context menu - I've added for better usage.\nYou're right. \"Delete\" is native, but on MacOSX there is no \"delete key\" and I must pres fn + backspace. For me (and I hope also for other Mac users) is more efficient use backspace than fn + backspace.\n. From sebastiangaul@gmail.com on May 12, 2012 09:25:58\nOkay, didn't know that. Macs do not have a native delete key? Another reason to avoid Apple machines ;)\n. From jacob...@gmail.com on January 29, 2013 15:05:52\nMacbooks have a delete key (which is actually \"backspace\"). I think they got this one right (delete forward is less frequently used ;). Anyway, ideological arguments it would be great if the keyboard mappings were either configurable or mapped to platform-specific idioms. Along these lines, I expect the command key to do much of what \"ctrl\" is used for (ctrl-c vs. command-c).\n. PageUp/Down will do this. Holding Shift will send it all the way to the front or back.\n. From przemysl...@gmail.com on July 25, 2010 06:51:47\nI confirm the same thing on Kubuntu 10.04 32-bit.

From ferdidep...@gmail.com on January 06, 2011 04:44:27\nHi, I'm experiencing the same problem. The biggest problem is moving pages from the far right to the far left (or either way). There is no short-cut and it involves multiple move operations. So without having to solve the performance of a move operation itself, it would also help to have a short-cut that would enable one to move a tab to an arbitrary position in one action.\nThanks for the effort!\nFerdi\n.

From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 08:39:22\nFor posterity, I'll attach my OS X build.  Like I said before, I'm not sure whether this will run standalone as-is or not.  If you try this package on OS X and it doesn't run, please let me know and I'll try building a package with a complete XUL.framework in the .app.\nAll you need to do is extract the .tar.gz.  (tar -zxf Pencil.app.tar.gz)\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 11:40:58\nSo...it seems that you do have to install the XULRunner OS X bundle for this to work.  There are two options:\n1) Provide an installer that installes XULRunner and Pencil.app\n2) Bundle XUL.framework with Pencil.app\nI've tested that #2 works but #1 would require more work to actually create the OS X PackageMaker project and automate it.\nUnfortunately, to test this you either need to install XULRunner, so that you have /Library/Frameworks/XUL.framework, or I need to upload a 19MB Pencil.app.tar.gz somewhere.\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 12:26:45\nHere is the standalone download link: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/479971/Pencil.app.tar.gz Of course, having to include the XUL.framework changes the build.xml and the content of the Build/MacOS contents.  I will hold off attaching a new Build_MacOS.tar.gz and osx_support_and_desktop_fixes.diff until we know that we have a working package and we can agree on how to package this.\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 13:37:32\nI'm not sure if you guys can tell but I've deleted the attachments.  The reason for this is I have created a discussion in the Pencil Users group to discuss my contributions and the packaging of such.  After finding that XUL.framework needed to be packaged into Pencil.app to run, my previous attachments were obsolete.  That and the fact that the discussion could seriously change the patch and files added, I have decided to just remove them.  The link to the standalone/complete Pencil.app is still valid.  Comments welcome.\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 13:37:44\nHere is the link to the discussion: http://groups.google.com/group/pencil-user/browse_thread/thread/46046f81a5bcefe4\n.

From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 21:12:10\nI have a handful of people test the Pencil.app in comment #3 and it worked great for them.  Based on the message, I'd assume that you have Firefox running and the Pencil extension installed/active when you got this but before I making any assumptions, I'll do more digging.  Can you give me anymore information?  (OS version, CPU type, was Firefox running, etc.)\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 21:23:08\nI've found a few instance on Google where people are reporting this with XULRunner applications but I can't seem to reproduce it.  Here are the scenarios I tried:\n1) Launched Firefox (without Pencil opened in Firefox) and opened Pencil.app\n2) Launched Firefox, opened Pencil in Firefox and opened Pencil.app\n3) Launched Pencil.app and tried to launch another Pencil.app\n4) Launched Pencil.app and then tried to open a .ep file from the Terminal\nI really will need more information before I can see what the problem is.\n.

From andrebac...@gmail.com on February 02, 2012 07:19:23\nYou will first have to extract the .xpi file (it is in reality just a .zip file).\nThen you edit BaseRasterizedExporter.js.\nAfter that, you zip the entire folder, change the file ending to .xpi and overwrite your original C:\\users\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles.default\\extensions\\pencil@evolus.vn.xpi (This is the path for Windows Vista/7, it is slightly different for XP).\n.

From dc.cebe...@gmail.com on October 19, 2010 08:25:20\nA workaround for this issue is described in issue #192 .\nIt seems there's a harcoded path somewhere in the Pencil application (or its XULRunner) that prevents it from running if it is not in the folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Evolus\".\nIf you have installed Pencil 1.2.0 somewhere else, and you don't mind the broken link in the \"Add/Remove Programs\", you can just move it to folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Evolus\\\", there is no need to uninstall and reinstall it.\nP.S.

From glen...@gmail.com on November 25, 2010 19:49:56\nIt would be a excellent feature to have\n. From ckwasnie...@gmail.com on January 13, 2011 01:05:55\nYes, this is really neccessary. The same problem occurs in Ubuntu. Moving a page makes the whole app dim for seconds, even on Core i5 2.66 GHz with 4GB RAM. Also, when I make a series of pages and then want to add a new one next to the first tab in the tab menu, I have to click \"Move left\" like 20 times which takes up to 5 minutes. \nThat is way too long.\n. From lindseyb...@gmail.com on March 13, 2012 14:52:14\nI completely agree! I am using Pencil to layout an application with many screens. It's becoming quite frustrating to have to keep moving each tab back/forth to get the right page placement.\n. From leozleoz01@gmail.com on October 10, 2012 02:49:32\nI agree as well. It might be easier to add an entry in the top left menu to move a tab before or after a particular tab. Indeed with 50 pages it becomes very long to move a tab\n. From leozleoz01@gmail.com on October 10, 2012 02:54:05\nI just thought, a layer windows for tabs (and for elements as well because managing the z-index of elements with only one menu is horrible) like photoshop or paint.net would be awesome!\n.

Ctrl+Enter is usually for submitting forms, Shift+Enter is usually for inserting linebreaks.\nIf anything changes, I think it would be to default Enter to inserting a linebreak & Ctrl+Enter to finish editing.\n.

The resulting file should work fine in Firefox (where the foreignObject tag of SVG is well supported), but libraries like batik (used in apache fop for example) will have trouble with the XHTML, XUL or XLink in it. I intend to extend the sheet to support at least a few of those elements I encounter, but I won't make promises I can't keep ;-)\nThe file attached can also be found as part of my collection of tools (used to generate DocBook and then PDF for my projects): https://github.com/Robert-Kosten/de.robertkosten.tools/blob/master/xsl/ep2svg.xsl It is currently under GPLv3, but I'd be willing to release it under GPLv2 so no-one has to invoke \"any later version\" should anyone wish to include it in their software ;-)\nAttachment: ep2svg.xsl\n.

I've added a few small fixes that I've reported in http://pencil-ff4.googlecode.com . I've used a different project so that all my changes can be tracked and merged to actual project if that will ever happen.\n.

From aleksi.y...@gmail.com on May 13, 2011 00:57:30\nThere are multiple issues regarding this. Both http://pencil-ff4.googlecode.com and https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/issues/detail?id=300 provide necessary fixes to make Pencil run in Firefox 4. I know that the first one contains all sorts of bugs but I don't know if the second one is less buggy. However, the main thing is that you can continue writing mockups on Firefox 4.\n.

From aleksi.y...@gmail.com on July 04, 2011 19:16:06\nPlease note that firefox 4 and 5 changes how xul is handled. Simply changing the supported version will cause some backgrounds to be missing from context menus (right click) and exporting images or using pages as background won't work if the stencil contains any XUL. Also sandbox evaluation has become more strict which breaks some stencil definitions. \nSee http://pencil-ff4.googlecode.com where some of these issues have been addressed. The whole thing is a work in progress though. \nAlso please update issue #291 , issue #292 , issue #298 , issue #300 , issue #306 etc if progress on this issue occurs.\n. while pasting huge images is currently slow, it does work properly.\n.

From psychol...@gmail.com on November 22, 2011 08:01:06\nNote: A temporary workaround is to manually add the collections inside the \\app\\content\\pencil\\definition\\collectionManager.js file after the system stencils (around line 100).\n(You need to extract the zip files first to a location, preferrably inside the pencil directory structure.)\n. From psychol...@gmail.com on November 22, 2011 08:07:33\nIn case anybody is not familiar with basic JavaScript do the following:\nCreate a new directory for the stencil inside the Pencil program directory, for me Windows 7 x64 this is:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\content\\pencil\\stencil\\\ne.g. Glyphish: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\content\\pencil\\stencil\\Glyphish\nNow extract the stencil zip file inside the directory.\nNext open \\app\\content\\pencil\\definition\\collectionManager.js with an editor (e.g. notepad) and go to line 100.\nThere you should see a line like like the following:\nCollectionManager.addShapeDefCollection(parser.parseURL(\"chrome://pencil/content/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\"));\nNow copy that line and paste it below. Change the path to the right so it points to your newly unzipped directory, like so:\nCollectionManager.addShapeDefCollection(parser.parseURL(\"chrome://pencil/content/stencil/Glyphish/Definition.xml\"));\nNext time Pencil starts the colleciton is loaded.\n. From psychol...@gmail.com on November 23, 2011 15:54:44\nAfter some more digging and experiencing a similar issue with the export templates, I found the best way is to change \"resource:app\" to \"CurProcD\".\nSo inside of exportTemplateManager.js, collectionManager.js and privateCollectionManager.js (inside /app/content/pencil/definition) replace \"resource:app\" with \"CurProcD\".\nAfter that it seems to work normally\n.

I had trouble using this solution simply because of the size of the file generated by Pencil (~15MB of XML!). Using gVim, I was able to access the files, but then found that large portions of the file had been lost at the point of failure (Windows XP blue screen of death).\nThis is a particularly annoying error / bug given that I saved constantly throughout the build process. At the point of failure, large portions of the file were corrupted and entire pages within the file lost.\nOverall, I've unfortunately found Pencil to be full of bugs and I am constantly having to allow for it's unusual behaviour and instability.\n. From david.j....@gmail.com on April 29, 2013 05:00:45\nI also had a similar problem when the program crashed in windows. I managed to change the file extension to xml, check the problem with XML copy editor ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml-copy-editor/?source=dlp ) and delete the corrupted parts and add the missing tags. Then changed the filename back to .ep and it was fine. Lost only one image. So thanks for the tip.\n. From AWJDThor...@gmail.com on May 20, 2013 17:07:24\nThanks. This worked for me as well.

Create backups / restore points. Be careful. Do this at your own risk. Etc.)\n1. Run regedit. Find and delete all keys that map .ep to xulrunner.exe / pencil.exe.\n2. Open a Command Prompt (cmd.exe) as an Administrator. Type the following commands:\nassoc .ep=epfile\nftype epfile=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\xulrunner\\xulrunner.exe\" \n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\application.ini\" \"%1\"\nregsvr32 /i shell32.dll\nGood luck. There may be some third party tool that makes this easier like \"Default Programs Editor\" or \"Creative Element Power Tool File Type Doctor\" but I had no luck with those.\n. From avrelian...@gmail.com on July 14, 2013 08:05:22\n@petsuter\nMaybe something has changed a little bit since your previous comment but I've solved the problem on Windows 8/64 simply by inserting string \n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\xulrunner\\xulrunner.exe\" \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\application.ini\" \"%1\"\ninto \"File name\" field of the \"Open with...\" dialog window\n1) Right click on .ep file\n2) \"Open with\" -> \"Choose default program...\"\n3) \"More options\"\n4) \"Look for another app on this PC\"\nThank you for the workaround\n. From james.g....@gmail.com on September 14, 2012 16:50:36\nThis is identical to issue #467 (or 467 is a duplicate of this one). \nIt appears the problem is related to the speed of the drag action. If acceleration of mouse movement is high then it appears that dragging is broken, slowing down the drag action allows the drag of a shape to work.\n. haha, thanks again :)\n.

From bpursley...@gmail.com on June 07, 2012 09:10:27\nI guess I should have explained a little more about this.  I was having problems getting tables with more than a couple of rows to display correctly.  The table grid was not drawn the same as the text, so it would be out of alignment.  It also was not shading the header correctly and the X-position of the columns was slightly off.  I think I was able to fix most of the display problems with the table.\nThe increase of column count maximum from 12 to 20 is unrelated to the display problems above, was just due to my need to be able to show more columns.\n. From bpursley...@gmail.com on June 08, 2012 08:59:02\nI just noticed that a similar fix for table layout issues has already been done in the 2.0 branch of the code.  So in that case, it probably does not make sense to include this patch at this point.  (Although I still would appreciate the maximum column limit to be increased to allow more than 12 column).\n.

From jpmdserv...@gmail.com on November 28, 2012 18:33:28\nHello,\nI was having the same issues but I have figured it out (at least it works for me)...after the copy/paste function would randomly disappear and my frustration grew I decided to test out a few ideas. I'm running the stand alone version Evolus 2.02 not the built in Firefox version. Basically, if the Firefox browser is not running then I'm unable to copy and paste. Every time I load up Firefox the copy/paste starts working. I should also mention that I didn't have this problem until I recently upgraded to the newest version of Evolus. My previous versions worked fine.\nAnyhow, hope this works for the rest of you....and Thanks to the Evolus team for a great application.\nGood luck and Peace,\nPaul\n.

From wutyeesh...@gmail.com on October 17, 2012 02:51:50\nI also faced that problem twice. All my files were gone. no back up at all..  is there any solution to get all the files back?\n. From rartdesi...@gmail.com on October 17, 2012 03:26:02\nActually there is. At the time it happened to me I was so frustrated I didn't think of this. Files aren't completly deleted from the hard disk even when you remove them from recycle bin; they are labeled as deleted so that the system is free to overwrite them when it needs it.\nThere are different softwares out there that scans your hard drives for deleted files\n(I used Recuva - http://www.piriform.com/recuva ). I don't know if there are other best software out there, this one was recommended by a friend too and it worked for me... eccept from a collection of large \"*.mpg\" practically the copy of one year of of recordings from my video-camera's memory. Precious moments, all gone...forever.\nBut is highly recommended that you use a recover software right after the deletion was made in order to increase your chances of success (or as soon as possible and trying not to make to many operations or reboot the system).\nThe irony is that by just searching and downloading the desired file recovery software you may overwrite important data.\nI wish you all the best.\nHope you recover all the files you need.\n. From rartdesi...@gmail.com on October 17, 2012 03:30:59\nPS: try not to download the software in the location your files were lost.\n(not that this will ensure you that they wont be rewrited but it can increase your chances).\n.

From james.g....@gmail.com on September 14, 2012 16:38:54\nI have this problem under Windows 7 64-bit standalone and under Ubuntu 12.04 running via Firefox (15.0.1). Problem appears to be specific to what is being dragged. Some objects refuse to drag at all. Some will work on a new page but then fail as soon as something else is added. There doesn't appear to be any clear reason why.\nSteps to reproduce running within firefox on Ubuntu 12.04.\n1. Create new page.\n2. Drag Rectangle on to page.\n3. Drag oval onto page.\nStep 3 fails. It cannot be dragged onto the page. Attempting to add a new rectangle also fails until a new page is open.\nEffectively the problem makes Pencil unusable both under Windows 7 (64-bit) as standalone and within Firefox under Ubutnu 12.04. \nI would suggest that the priority is increased from medium to a higher level as currently the tool is unusable in the environments I have tested.\n. From james.g....@gmail.com on September 14, 2012 16:46:44\nWhile doing further testing have determined that under the Ubuntu 12.04/Firefox environment that the drag failure is related to the speed of the drag operation. \nIf the drag is slow enough then the drag to add a shape to the page works 100% of the time.\nIf the drag action is above a certain speed then the drag fails.\nThis appears to be the reason why it's hard to recreate as speed of the drag operation is what affects the failure of the page to become a target. It appears that what happens is the page is made a target of the drag operation briefly, but then the page is removed as a drag target, thus stopping the drag operation to work. \nThe work around is to drag slowly. It is possible that this is a problem for people who have enabled fast acceleration of their mouse (which I have, on both environments). The reason for enabling fast acceleration is because on environment makes use of a 30 inch monitor and the other uses two large monitors.\n. See #802, #856 .

Evolus still has their stencil development guide up:\nhttp://pencil.evolus.vn/wiki/devguide/Introduction.html\n. That'd be awesome! \nMuch of my time has been spent reading, comprehending, fixing & cleaning all this code. So it'll probably be a while before I get ready to learn about & tackle issues for stencils - any help is appreciated :)\nDon't feel obligated to wait for #676 to update the docs - anything changed in the repo will get updated when I convert everything. But don't feel obligated to do it now either... Just don't feel obligated in general :P\nIf you like, we could merge your Android stencils so they're included in every Pencil install. Although I've wondered why the original authors decided to distribute zips of contributed stencils instead of just merging them into the repo. Maybe there is a good reason for it, maybe not...\n. Yeah, I figured it might be easier for stencil maintainers if they were in a different repository. I was first thinking I could simply add the submodules under the appropriate directory in the app folder, but that wouldn't work for collections like your Material Icons - which need to be built. Maybe I'll modify the build script to download, include(and build, if necessary) any 3rd party stencils when building the application.\nDo you know if it's possible for users to override a collection if the collection already exists within Pencil's code?\n. I've split those out into #677 and #678 \n. Closing, nathielw's stencil collection solves this :)\n.

Well my now main concern is that this fork has nothing to do with Evolus, so I think it would be best to change it to pencil or pencil-prototyping or something along those lines. \nI did some more digging & the original pencil animation project the OP was submitting died & was forked into this: http://www.pencil2d.org/\nI downloaded the package for the 0.5.4 release & it looks like the executable & the folder is named pencil2d now, so I think it is safe to switch back to using just pencil for the data - unless there is another linux app with the name pencil(I didn't find one on Arch or Nix).\n.

I had the same the issue after upgrading my archlinux system. \nFirst I was not able to open evolus-pencil because xulrunner-bin was not found. \nxulrunner-bin belongs to the version 14.*. So, I changed the execution of that file to the newest version of it wich is located in /usr/lib/xulrunner-devel-20.0/bin/xulrunner --app \"$APP_INI\", in /usr/lib/evolus-pencil-svn/evolus-pencil.sh.\nSecond issue arises after this fix, when Gecko attempts to load that version of xulrunner, so I changed to MaxVersion=20.* in /usr/lib/evolus-pencil-svn/app/application.ini.\nAt this point evolus-pencil is running fine.\nFinally when I attempted to export to any different format, evolus-pencil fails as this thread reports the issue.\nIt was fixed thank's to the suggestion #4.\nfind 264 line in svgRasterizer.js , change the following line\npersist.saveURI(uri, null, null, null, null, localFile); \nto \npersist.saveURI(uri, null, null, null, null, localFile , null );\nThank's :)\n.

From jay.ga...@DataMgmtSvcs.com on May 25, 2014 13:52:50\nThe size of the created SVG document appears to be coming directly from usr/share/pencil/content/pencil/exporter/Pencil2SVG.xslt, where it is hard coded as:\n<svg width=\"744.09448819\" height=\"1052.3622047\"\nSo, either there is no code which is modifying these defaults to the correct dimensions for the document, or it is not working correctly.\n. #718 is merged. \nI did some quick googling so I don't know if it's feasible for us but I saw that SVG has a pageSet element:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-SVG12-20041027/multipage.html\nDo you think we could use that?\n. @fabionaka that's concerning... the documentation shows your code should work fine:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIFilePicker#appendFilter()\nCan you try it without the * like in the original report?\nfp.appendFilter(\"Definition.xml\", \".xml\");\n.

I have the same issue with 2.0.3 using the default xulrunner. The fix I used for 2.0.3 (not sure it works for 2.0.5) is to point Pencil to a different xulrunner (something greater than xulrunner 1.9.8) , I chose xulrunner 2.0.0 from here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/ then modified the /usr/bin/pencil script to look like this:\n!/bin/sh\n/usr/bin/firefox --app \"/usr/share/pencil/application.ini\"\n/home/installed/xulrunner/2.0.0/xulrunner  --app \"/usr/share/pencil/application.ini\"\n.

Rolling back to 2.0.3 on MacOSX Mavericks did not solve the problem. Same thing happens when I open the files with the Firefox plugin. As a workaround, I installed Pencil 2.0.3 on Win XP virtual machine and I can see all widgets correctly.\nIt's funny, because if I resize a widget it becomes visible, but when I undo the resize operation, again it \"magically disappears\". \nThis indeed should have a high priority. I have some mockups with dozens of widgets and resizing them all separately is really impossible.\n.

Click any control within designer area (windows form, group box, text control)\n2. Press CTRL + A (select all)\n3. Right click and Go to properties\n4. You will get Multiple objects properties window\n5. Select check box colour above check box Advance mode is colour picker is disabled\n6. Select black colour and set opacity 100% (slider control is there)\nAll the texts will be visible\n(y)\n. Going through previous issues, it looks like this only affects the Native UI Stencil Collection & is fixed by reverting to 2.0.3. Maybe diffing HEAD against v2.0.3 will show the issue.\n. Backgrounds, shapes & labels are messed up in exports until the Page's tab is selected as well.\n. Many hours have been sunk into this - no resolution yet. \nI've been looking at how Pencil loads the initial document - but it might be a problem with the stencils themselves instead.\n. Poked at this some more... doesn't seem like a notable difference between the Stencil Definitions of the working Sketchy Labels & the broken Native Labels.\nI poked around at the Shape prototype for a little & will probably pick up my investigation there.\nOn the plus side, I'm learning tons about the codebase as I slowly comb through everything to figure this out...\n. @amarach78 You can grab the old source from the google code project page:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/downloads/list\nThe fact that I didn't find anything in the diff might mean that some change in the xulrunner/firefox framework caused this issue instead of some code in this repo. Or maybe I just missed something.\n. That's great, thanks. The next step is to figure out the version of xulrunner that broke the native stencils so we can look at the release notes for that version & figure out what changed and broke the stencils.\nI might be able to get to that in the next few days(unless you're interested in taking it on). \n. Thanks, I'll checkout the update notes for xul 17 and try poking around again.\n. Sorry all, been trying really hard to fix this... \nI can't find anything about using native GUI widgets in XUL. Can't even seem to find the release notes for XRE v17 to see what changed :( I think the last resort may have to be diffing the whole codebase from v16.0.2 -> v17 and pick through to see what might've broken this...\n. @mvdw It's a XUL button, not an HTML button:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/button\nHTML button would be marked up like <html:button>...</html:button>\n. I was able to get button text to load by removing the font-size:0px; from the surrounding html:div element in the stencil:\nxml\n<html:div xmlns:html=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"div\" style=\"-moz-box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; position: relative; line-height: 1px !important; font-size: 0px;\" xmlns=\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\">\n    <button id=\"xulControl\"\n            style=\"margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;\" />\n    <html:div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"/>\n</html:div>\nHowever, the loaded button's styling is different and changes when you edit it's text...\nMore digging to go...\n.

I made a thread to see if I could take over the existing extension instead of re-releasing:\nhttps://forums.mozilla.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=24109\n. Hooray! I appreciate any time spent on this :)\nFor setting up the initial structure, see: http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html\nMost of the docs will most likely be just plain RST: http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html\nAlthough additional Sphinx constructs may be useful: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/index.html\nYou can ignore all the autodoc, cross-referencing & javascript domain stuff for now(although if sphinx-quickstart asks please switch the default domain to javascript).\nThanks & let me know if you run into any problems!\n. Awesome!\nFor links to sections, I'd recommend adding a label before the section header & linking to that using ref, instead of using rst links.\nFrom: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html#ref-role\nUsing ref is advised over standard reStructuredText links to sections (like\n`Section title`_) because it works across files, when section headings are\nchanged, and for all builders that support cross-references.\n. Live at http://pencil-prototyping.rtfd.org\nGonna do a little cross-referencing & re-organization before closing this.\n. Welp that last commit makes it show tutorial pages in the sidebar when you build them locally - for some reason RTDs doesn't pick up the template override. I will investigate...\n. @nathanielw The online docs now have the sidebar nesting you requested: https://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/devguide/tutorial/index.html\nI've also reviewed & added cross-references to the Reference guide.\nI think that pretty much wraps up this ticket, but I haven't developed a Stencil yet so I don't know what would be super useful to include. Additional feedback welcome, otherwise I'll close this off in a couple of days.\n. At some point I'll move the less useful docs out of the readme & into sphinx(like maintainer-only info), but I'm going to go ahead & close this now.\n. If we were to use JSON I think it'd be best to have something like this:\njson\n[\n  { \"name\": \"Material Icons\",\n    \"repo\": \"http://github.com/nathanielw/Material-Icons-for-Pencil.git\",\n    \"buildCommand\": \"\",\n  },\n]\nThat way:\n- we can use name to determine the folder to create in the content/pencil/stencil/ folder(stripping spaces or replacing them with underscores)\n- the repo isn't tied to github\n- a buildCommand can be specified, or left blank to indicate no building is required\nWe would have to pick some cli utility to parse the JSON file for use in build.sh (jq or jshon come to mind - not sure which is more popular).\nAs an aside: I'd really love to use YAML instead of JSON for human-edited things like this, but the dearth of YAML CLI utilities makes this seem improbable.\nIf we go with submodules, we'd probably stick them somewhere like build/Stencils/ & copy the folders directly(so we wouldn't need a name).  We could check for a Definition.xml file to figure out whether the collection needs to be built or not. I think the build commands would have to be hardcoded into build.sh - unless we asked stencil devs to have a standardized build file for us to hook up to. Updating the submodules would have to become part of the release process(git submodule foreach git pull origin master).\nSo it seems like JSON would be more maintainable & expandable, although it would add a little more knowledge overhead for comprehending the build system(knowing JSON & whatever utility we use to parse it).\n. Sorry I didn't mean to make it seem like I was against using JSON, I just wanted to list out the pros & cons, so I could think on it. I think it's an OK trade off, but I imagined it would only be knowledge required for Pencil's developers/maintainers & stencil developers. So this little bit confuses me:\n\nusers wouldn't need the overhead of knowing a new markup language really\n\nAre you saying we should let end-users install collections by adding a username & repo in a config file, similar to antigen or vim-plug?\nI'm thinking of something like getting stencil devs to supply a manifest.json with their collection that contains a bunch of metadata, including the following attributes:\n- name\n- version \n- downloadUrl\n- requiresBuild\n- buildCommands\n- manifestUrl\nFor including collections with Pencil, we just add the repo to a file in build/. The build script can clone/update all repos listed in the file & check the manifest.json to see if a build is required.\n- If requiresBuild is true & buildCommands doesn't exist, the script will download the pre-built zip from downloadUrl(into some location dependent on the version in order to prevent redundant downloads). If buildCommands exists, the script will instead run them inside the cloned folder.\n- If requiresBuild is false, it'll just copy the files into Outputs/Pencil/.../stencil/${name} where ${name} comes from manifest.json.\nWe can also eventually expand this into something that allows users to easily install & auto-upgrade collections. Users could enter a file path or url to a manifest.json or the collection's .zip. Pencil would download & compare manifestUrl to see if a newer version is available & download that using the downloadUrl instead. Then it could be handled like regular zip imports. For automatic updates, Pencil could compare the manfiest at manifestUrl to the installed manifest.json, if the version differs, it would automatically download & replace the collection from downloadUrl.\nThen, way in the future, we can use the manifest.json to create a Pencil Stencil Repository or something similar, where stencil devs can upload their manifest.json, screenshots, the collection's .zip, etc to some server. We could add a window to Pencil that talks to the server and fetches the manifest.jsons and allows the user to browse, search & install all collections listed in the repository.\nThis heavily rips off of how firefox does addons, here's an example of what firefox stores(in your profile's addons.json): https://gist.github.com/prikhi/795a025c829b45769aa7\nComments? Suggestions? Feedback?\nI'd also love to hear from @nathanielw about all this, as he's the only active stencil developer I know of :P\n. I'm fine with ditching building collections, I only imagined building collections when building Pencil - not when users update or install a collection. The only benefit I saw(which seems small) was that whenever I build/release a new version of Pencil it would include the latest versions of the bundled collections instead of the last released ones.\n. On Sun, Apr 26, 2015 at 05:54:35AM -0700, Jay Looney wrote:\n\n@prikhi So, only add it if there is demand?\nYeah seems fine to me.\n. > talking about \"Bundled Collections\" are you referring to a collection that you install all at once as a group, or the collection that distributes with pencil itself\n\nBy Bundled Collections, I meant 3rd-party collections that would eventually be included by #677. \nIn general this ticket was meant for both(I believe Pencil treats them equally under the hood but I haven't completely immersed myself in the stencil collection code yet). But now that I think about it, the latter isn't as big a deal - I'm failing to come up with reasonable circumstances where someone might want to replace a built-in collection instead of just upgrading(maybe an incompatible version of FF/XR?).\n\nit wouldn't be too difficult to build a dependency management solution\n\nBy dependency management, do you mean version management? As far as I know there aren't dependencies between stencil collections(where one collection requires that another is installed).\nI was thinking stencil collections could have a version/last-updated/modified attribute or something similar, and Pencil could ensure you only replace a collection with a collection that has a higher version number. I don't see versioning as a necessary requirement for this ticket, we could just let users replace a collection with any version of that collection.\n. Sorry I misspoke as well, I meant to say this ticket was meant for all collections - built-in collections, bundled collections, and user-created/installed collections.\n\nIf we base it on github repositories it can easily check if there is an update to the repository and grab it automatically.\n...\nThen it would be as simple as running a git pull on each collection to update when the application is launching.\n\nWhile I'm not opposed to automatically updating stencil collections, I meant for this issue to be more about allowing end-users to manually replace them on their individual installation/profile instead of requiring the stencil to be uninstalled first. So it seems to me to be a bit out of scope for this issue(correct me if I'm misunderstanding), but feel free to create a new issue for it if you'd like(or I can when I have some more free time).\n. Actually you can scroll to switch pages, but if you scroll past all pages that are currently displayed, the tab bar does not scroll to follow you.\n. Beautiful, thanks :)\nI built it on rtfd.org, check it out: https://evolus-pencil.readthedocs.org/en/sphinx-docs/\nStay tuned for comments.\n. Yup, pencil is taken so I changed it to pencil-prototyping, rtd is just taking its time with it.\nSeems like the only other comments I have are small knitpicks that I can just edit as I go through the diff. Could you rebase all this into a single commit? You should be able to do:\nbash\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:prikhi/pencil.git\ngit fetch upstream develop\ngit rebase -i upstream/develop\nThen mark as commits except your first one as squash & edit the commit message. Lemme know if you need more info.\n. Thanks :)\n. Thanks\n. Whew, thank you both for your doc improving efforts :)\nI will start my pass through them soon\n. Thanks :)\n. I checked out the release docs and it doesn't look like there's any breaking changes(breaking changes aren't separated out, usually have to search the page for breaking or incompatible).\nSo I've bumped it & will put out a new release & upload new builds for 2.0.9.\nAs for PRs, I'd like to keep MaxVersion on a major version that has been tested(instead of just doing MaxVersion=*). The bare minimum tests I do are:\n- Can I load a file?\n- Can I save, quit then load without losing data?\n- Can I export to PNG?\nIf you attest to testing these things, I'll take a PR that bumps MaxVersion.\n. Tada: https://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.9\n. Beautiful thanks :)\n. Merged, thanks. Do you need a new release out for this?\nIf this makes Pencil install-able for all Gentoo users, feel free to add the relevant info to the readme\n. Thanks - I'm at the very end of my awake cycle, so I'll put a new release out once I've gotten some sleep.\n. I put out v2.0.10\n. Thanks again :)\n. Can you try v2.0.10\n. @donniezazen Related commit fixes this, caused by #!/bin/sh instead of #!/bin/bash in the pencil executable.\n. This is released as v2.0.11, let me know if everything is alright.\n. Fixed by #692 \n. There should be default templates. Pencil is looking in the wrong place when installed as an extension. Fix incoming.\n. Heya, I've been away for a while so I've got a backlog of stuff in all my projects, just quickly checking in so you know you're not being ignored. I will review & merge this soon-ish.\n. How should I package the folder for downloading? Is a zip OK? Or rar, tar?\nI'd like to add install directions to the readme. How does one go about installing the downloaded file(maybe this is obvious for Mac users)?\nOtherwise, looks good thanks :)\n. I merged this but rebased it so github doesn't want to acknowledge it :/\n. > I just realised this is already addressed in #667, sorry for the duplicate.\nIt's OK, the majority of the 500 or so issues on here were imported from Evolus' old bug tracker, so any confirmation that those issues are still occurring is helpful.\nThat said, I'm closing this as a duplicate, marking #667 as confirmed & assigning it to milestone v2.1.0, please subscribe to #667 if you want updates.\n. Not sure what you mean by painter. Do you mean the color selection tool? If not, can you please clarify or give instructions on how to reproduce this behavior.\nIf you mean the color selection tool, that can be exited by pressing your Escape key.\n. The escape key is commonly used throughout the app to \"escape\" from things like nav menus, text boxes, dropdowns, popups, etc. \nI'm gonna say this isn't really worth it right now because it'd be a button just to deselect the \"Copy Shape Format\" tool. It would be useful if we add more tools where the click action is replaced.\n. There are 2 ways to do this:\n1. In the line section to the right of the color toolbar section, set the number input to 0(this controls the border width).\n2. Right click the shape & choose Actions -> Remove Border.\nDoes this seem OK?\n. If you're on Linux, you could try removing your ~/.cache/pencil folder. There's profiles in ~/.pencil as well.\n. Thanks!\n. The latest release(v2.0.11) fixes this.\n. Thanks!\n. I was thinking of something simple: a short description, download links for the current version, doc & github links and a list of features with screenshots. This could all fit on a single page so I was thinking either just HTML & CSS or using some Javascript library as well.\nI actually already did this as a way to test out mercury.js but I thought my design was a little off. Maybe mercury.js  is too obscure of a library as well... I'll push it to the gh-pages branch soon so you can see what it actually looks like.\n\n. I pushed it to the gh-pages branch, let me know what you think:\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/tree/gh-pages\nhttp://prikhi.github.io/pencil/\n. I've got the majority of it rewritten in plain HTML & bootstrap, I've just been too busy w/ other work to finish it up...\nI was thinking a simple page would be a little more \"user-friendly\" than using the docs, although that'd keep everything in one place...\n. And yeah, I didn't think we'd use mercury - that was just me playing around & I wanted to share the design.\nStatic site generators seem a little overkill to me(that's essentially what I wrote w/ mercury). Maybe I'm missing something though?\n. ^ Referenced wrong issue\n. Descriptive names and small functions are great, I would accept PRs that made those kinds of changes(and pretty much anything else from Code Complete or Clean Code). \nBut I'm sure there are people that are way more comfortable with just commenting than actually changing any code and I'd probably accept those PRs as well(& probably just clean it up myself).\nPlus, any class/function comments will be parsed into API Docs:\nhttps://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html\nSo this is ideal(but not expected):\n` javascript\n/*\"\"\"\n.. function:: size_of_last_box(size_of_box)\n    Calculate the number of eggs in the last box, assuming all\n    of the boxes have a maximum size ofsize_of_box``.\n:param size_of_box: The maximum size of a box.\n   :type size_of_box: Number\n   :returns: The number of eggs in the last box.\n   :rtype: Number\n*/\nfunction size_of_last_box(size_of_box) {\n  number_of_eggs = add_numbers(b,c) \n  return get_remainder(number_of_eggs, size_of_box) \n}\n```\n. Thanks!\n. I fixed it before checking for PRs >.< \nBut thanks :)\n. Thanks. In the future it'd be nice if links were added to the bottom(but not a big deal).\n. #713 Added the gitter badge. Should I add anything else?\n. Death to trailing whitespace!\nThanks :)\n. Merci beaucoup!\n. Thanks\n. If you're interested you could write it using Sphinx markup:\nhttp://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/index.html#writing-documentation\nlike this:\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/blob/develop/app/content/pencil/common/pencil.js#L53-L67\nand it'll show up in the api docs:\nhttp://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html\nIf not, let me know & I'll merge it.\n. So this actually brings up a good question: what should the section nesting in the docs look like?\nIf you check out the current Pencil namespace API: https://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html#pencil\nit kinda looks like this:\n* Class or Namespace\n      * attributes \n  * functions\nWith your current indention it'll look like this:\n* Class or Namespace\n      * attributes \n  * other functions\n* Pencil.setPainterCommandChecked\nwhere the new function is below the Namespace instead of nested within it. I think a flat structure(where we un-nest the attributes & other functions like you did) might be better since everything is nested under a section header of the class or namespace already & you won't have to worry about the proper indentation when writing docs, you can just align it with the /*\"\"\"\nComments? Otherwise I'll probably merge this & fix the others\n. Heyo, I had actually meant that I would probably migrate the other indentations to match yours - sorry for the confusion.\n. Sorry for the delay, I thought github would email me when PRs were opened...\n. Thanks :)\n. I've kept the maxVersion to a version someone's tested Pencil on because I'm kinda paranoid of a backwards incompatible change destroying saved data... Maybe that's too paranoid?\nDo PNG exports work in v17? I believe this change in FF36 broke them:\n\nThe nsIWebBrowserPersist.saveURI() method now requires 8 arguments, in an order incompatible with previous releases.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/36\n. FF36 made us make a change that breaks the app for every previous version of FF. If you try exporting a document as a PNG with a version before FF36 it will just hang. I think all export methods might've been broken by this. I think it's a good idea to keep it at 36.\nI'm running FF's dev release now so I'll at least keep the maxversion at that version number(currently 41), maybe bump it up to 200 or something.\nWindows builds have xulrunner packaged with them already.\nIf openSUSE's xulrunner is that old, I'd run a sed command when packaging that removes xulrunner from the BINARIES array in /bin/pencil(assuming opensuse's packaging system allows this) & then make the package depend on Firefox instead of xulrunner. That'll make sure it uses FF to launch instead of xulrunner.\n. Thanks :)\n. I changed it because the pencil2d animation software was installing under /usr/share/pencil on debian. I think they now use pencil2d instead so it should be OK to switch it back. See #499 instead.\n. Should be fine to fix it. Need to make sure to update the Arch Linux PKGBUILD if the folder name in -linux-pkg.tar.gz is modified. Will this require switching to /usr/share/pencil?\n. Thanks for packaging this :)\n. Thanks a lot! I'm about to go out of town for 2 weeks & I might not have time to review this before then.\n. Thanks, will release a new version with a .deb soon.\nThe sudo chown -R root ... line isn't necessary is it? It causes an error for me & everything seems fine with it removed.\n.

So I'd prefer to keep the default to xulrunner.\n. Last time I tested I wasn't able to get this working. I will retest soon - I think I forgot to clear the cache or my profile.\n. This is in the readme already, under Builds -> Windows:\nYou'll need curl installed so you can pull the Windows XULRunner runtime and nsis to compile the installer.\nBut I went ahead & made nsis a link to the site.\n. Hey, this is in the Documentation section of the readme:\ncd docs/\nsudo pip install -r requirements.txt\nmake html\n. Thanks! New version soon.\n. Thanks!\n. Bout to release a new version, will try to get this in.\n. This exists & should be supported in the github & mozilla XPI files in the next version.\nShould I add anything in the Readme with respect to Palemoon before closing this?\n. OK did more reading, looks like exporting won't work because of breaking changes mozilla make to FFv38. People have asked for me to support a lower version of FF/XRE before, I will investigate.\n. Exporting now works in Palemoon as of v2.0.21. You should also be able to install it from the firefox addons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n. Also issue #802 does not occur when using with Palemoon.\n. Thanks, been holding out hoping the old author would get back to me about taking over the extension already on the AMO but I'll probably cave now.\n. Awaiting validation:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\nIf mozilla truly deprecates XUL, pencil will die unless it is re-written using the WebExtensions API - provided the API can actually provide equivalent functionality of XUL...\n. Thanks for bumping this and reminding me :)\n. Reopening this because at the rate that mozilla is approving plugins, it will take a year and a half for Pencil to be reviewed & signed... We are number 144 in the queue and haven't moved since I uploaded 3 days ago...\nI think the solution will be to keep that in the review queue and also upload an unlisted XPI that can be distributed via the github releases page. Unlisted addons get signed immediately so that would allow installation once FF hits v44(where I believe the ability to install unsigned plugins will be removed).\n. Unlisted XPIs are uploaded to AMO, just not shown in their addons directory, and thus are immediately signed instead of having to wait for approval.\nBut thanks to Noitidart, the listed Pencil addon has been approved early and can be installed without disabled the signature requirements:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n. Thanks :)\n. Can you try installing this package and let me know if it works OK:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jypxqi5hzv1alq5/pencil-2.0.14-ubuntu-all-debian-fix.deb?dl=0\n. Awesome, I'll go ahead an merge it.\nUnfortunately, using a version lower than 36 breaks all export methods:(\n. Looks better, thanks :)\n. Thanks, are the rightmost numbers expected/actual?\n. Only lintian error now is our lack of a manpage.\n. Thanks for this, I'm away from my home base at the moment, but I'll try to get this in soon.\n. I've been holding off on this - been thinking we should ask the mailing list or more users about which they prefer...\nIf one of you would like to make a post to the pencil-users google group, go ahead - otherwise I will at some point.\nAlso, feedback from contributers would be appreciated:\n@nathanielw @jdittrich @mvdw @just-paja @horacimacias @joemirizio @Zyzle @ovruni\n. These are great. \nMaybe it's a pen because we are manipulating stencils, and pen + stencil = pencil ??\n. Thanks :)\n. @bmarkovic Are you always behind a proxy? If not, does OpenClipart not work for you all the time?\n. Moving is easy, coming up with fair decision-making, & membership processes are the hard parts.\n. Thanks for catching that @igpremuo \n. Oops, actually that only applies for debian builds. I'll move all linux builds to either pencil or pencil-prototyping before the next release...\n. #499 \n. Fixed in develop, new version soon.\n. Awesome, thanks for contributing :)\n. Did you have any previous versions of Pencil installed?\nIf so, could you try running off of my develop branch with the -purgecaches option just to make sure this wasn't caused by an older version?\nLike this:\nbash\n./build.sh mac\nOutputs/Mac/XUL.framework/Versions/Current/xulrunner Outputs/Mac/Pencil.app/Contents/Resources/application.ini -purgecaches\nIf you've tried the develop branch with no caches already let me know and I'll merge this.\n. Tested on linux as well, works great - thanks!\n. Hi, changing the max version should be fine. It's been done on the develop branch already.\nI'm not at home and my laptop's distro(NixOS) doesn't have everything to make a new release on the master branch - so it'll have to wait til the 29th or so, or I'll have to write a package for nsis.\n. AMO will automatically reject the plugin if the MaxVersion is too high. Went ahead & tested on FF Developer so should be good til v46 now.\n. (new release on the way)\n. for now you can disable extension signing by toggling xpinstall.signatures.required in about:config\nfirst priority for installs will be getting the unlisted XPI signed while we wait for the listed one to be reviewed. then I'll poke around debian installs. Might be a little while, on the road so I can't spin up a ubuntu VM to play around w/ it.\n. Awesome, I've been wanting this feature.\nI'll be traveling home all day tomorrow, then I gotta rebuild my desktop, I'll review it when I get everything all setup again.\n. Does the other pencil application store stuff in /usr/share/pencil? Is the binary named pencil? If so those will have to change as well, I will update the debian/ubuntu build script to deal with that in a couple of days and make a new release.\n. Haven't heard of anyone working on them. You might want to ask on the mailing list as well:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pencil-user\nIf you find or start this project, feel free to submit a PR adding the collection to the Readme.\n. Should be possible by just changing architecture in builds/Ubuntu/control to any or all. The initial PR had it set to amd64 & I didn't catch it, sorry about that.\nGrabbing Ubuntu i386 right now so I can test it out first.\n. Maybe try removing the ~/.pencil folder XULRunner sets up? You could also see if firefox --app /path/to/pencil/application.ini works.\n. You could also try xulrunner /path/to/application.ini --purgecaches.\n. XPI is the application as a firefox addon, EXE is the application as a native Windows program. I don't use Firefox Cloud or know how it works so I can't comment on that, but both versions should let you save to the current computer.\nI merged the PR by @mikedlr and added a link to Mozilla's Addon Repository as well.\nAlso,  there is Google Group from the old Evolus Pencil that you can use:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pencil-user\n. Should be fixed now.\n. Interesting, thanks for the report. Were no breaking changes in FF45 according to mozilla... Will investigate.\n. I'm pretty sure it's a bug in Firefox. There's nothing relevant in the release notes for FFv45.\nI made a bug: https://bugzil.la/1259385\n. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1259385#c13\nGonna have to go through the nightlies & figure out which one breaks Pencil.\n. I don't really have the time to figure this out, sorry guys. If you're getting this bug, I suggest moving on to http://github.com/evolus/pencil.\nI'll keep bumping maxVersion hoping it'll be fixed in the future but if you want to continue using v2 either use an older firefox, or use xulrunner/palemoon. I'm using this repo, mostly with xulrunner but also with palemoon.\n. Wow, this is great, thanks a lot :)\n. Thanks!\n. Accidentally left a debug flag on when building the latest versions, 2.0.18 incoming soon.\n. Can you test 2.0.18? \nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.18\n. Sorry, internet died in the middle of my upload & I didn't notice. Should be up there now.\n. That looks like Norton 360 Total Security, not a Windows pop-up. The files under the xulrunner directory are distributed by Mozilla. If you trust Mozilla, you should allow the installer to create those target files.\nAnother option is to install firefox then create a .bat file that runs firefox.exe -app C:/path/to/pencil/folder/application.ini.  Installing somewhere other than C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ might also prevent this.\n. Wow, didn't even know about Pencil v3. That's great because I have nowhere near the amount of free time it would take to get Pencil from XUL to Webextensions. My last ditch \"keep Pencil alive\" plan was going to be switching to supporting Pale Moon.\nI did try to contact them via Twitter & Email when I forked Pencil, & never got a response. Then I got an email from them saying they were going to bring it back & incorporate some of my changes - but I never heard back from them after that.\n. Got an email about this as well. I was able to open my .ep files from Pencil v2 but couldn't add new stencils to my document :/\nI'm going to see if D\u01b0\u01a1ng is willing to put up a project roadmap along with some issues so we can have some easy ways to hook into the new development.\nI think the future of this repo will be patching it to work with Pale Moon(even if they re-fork they said it will still support XUL) & releasing a linux version with a bundled xulrunner(like the windows & os x versions), just to make it last for people who can't switch to v3 for whatever reason.\n. There's a link to the new project in the readme, I will be keeping this project minimally-maintained for use w/ xulrunner/palemoon.. Thanks, might take me a couple days before I can look over it & test it out.\n. Thanks!\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Thanks again :)\n. Should be fixed.\n. Bumped this to 52 in the lastest release. . See #802\n. See #802\n. See #802\n. Awesome, thanks. I added a link to the icons in this repo's README.\nYou may want to let Evolus know as well, if they are compatible w/ v3(I don't know of any stencil differences between v2 & v3).. I added a link to v3 in the readme. I'll keep maintaining this but probably won't do much more development. I get the \"can't drag & drop\" bug in v3, so I'm still using this with xulrunner/palemoon.\n. Fixed\n. Should be fixed. I tried to keep it to versions I've tested but haven't had time to work on pencil for a while, especially since v3 exists now. If I have trouble keeping the maxVersion up to date, I'll just bump it up to 999 or something.\n. Should be fixed. You might want to check out the http://github.com/evolus/pencil repo as well.\n. Thanks.\n. For version 3, please open an issue with Evolus' repository: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. See #802\n. Yup, 3.0 issues should be reported to https://github.com/evolus/pencil. For version 3, please open an issue with Evolus' repository: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. Yeah this is a bug in newer FF versions & neither me nor mozilla have the time to figure out whats going on. I'll keep bumping maxVersion hoping it'll be fixed in the future but either use an older firefox, or use xulrunner/palemoon.\n. Did v49 fix the drag-and-drop issue?\n. Does 2.0.21 not work?. @giancarloandroid First release of this repository was v2.0.6. You should checkout the standalone version on this repo's Releases page, or http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3.. See #802 \nFor ubuntu standalone, you can try installing xulrunner\nLet me know if you are experiencing a different issue & I'll re-open. Either use Pale Moon, Xulrunner, an older version of Firefox, or Pencil v3.\nSee #802. That is Evolus' home page, not this projects. Our downloads are on this github projects \"Releases\" page. Alternatively, checkout the Pencil v3 project: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. I think this is fixed by modifying our deb to include xulrunner instead of depending on firefox. This hasn't been fixed. Don't know when I will have the time to fix it.\nSomeone else could start by taking a look at the ubuntu function in builds/build.sh. The fix would include xulrunner in the package and modify the pencil script to call that xulrunner instead of firefox/iceweasel, then remove firefox/iceweasel from the ubuntu dependencies.. Pencil v3 is released, will only be doing minimal maintenance to this repo, I'd make an issue in the v3 repo: http://github.com/evolus/pencil . See #856 #802 and http://github.com/evolus/pencil. See #856 . Wrong repo, see http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3.. Wrong repo, see http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3..

I wasn't sure if scrollbar referred to an wireframe element or to the Pencil window's actual scrollbar, so I tested this with both.\nWith a vertical scrollbar for the window(caused by having a page height setting that is less than the window's working area height), I couldn't get the scrollbar to disappear by increasing(or decreasing) the Page's height.

From jpmorris...@gmail.com on August 19, 2011 10:57:37\nI have the stand-alone Evolus Pencil, and it also has the same problem. \nWorkaround: Create a 'New Page' and set the background on that. This one will save and be okay when you open the file again. But do not change the name or background on the page after it's been created. If you do, then it will revert to white background again. I'm not sure if this work-around will work with the plug-in but why not try it?\n. From maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com on December 12, 2008 13:40:49\nLabels: Type-Enhancement\n.

(TabBox in Native UI Widgets).\nTo help a little fixing this issue I can tell you which part of the xml-file causes\nthis behaviour: \nIt is the -tag and its property selectedIndex=\"n\"\nIt seems, that n isn't updatet on changing the # in pencil. Deleting the\nselectedIndex-property or manually changing its value results in proper displaying in\npencil.\nThe tag  has the selectedIndex-property as well with same value, although\nit didn't matter in my tests you might want to pay attention on that as well...\n.

From brownsp...@gmail.com on August 22, 2008 07:14:22\nOk, I have isolated the source of the problem: a bitmap image's path has been\nchanged. It took me a while to notice that an image wasn't displaying, and that I\nrenamed the folder to which that image belongs. The error message was a bit on the\ncryptic side for me to figure out what exactly was happening.\nA friendlier error message might be in order.

From kanng...@gmail.com on November 03, 2010 02:09:20\nMore options for export to PNG, like resolution, quality etc.\n. From tasin.r...@gmail.com on March 01, 2011 02:44:30\nI think a better exporting option is to be able to export the whole document where each page is treated as a separate HTML page rather than the all pages as a single HTML page. \nAs version 1.1 allows you to create links to other pages, it's a shame not to be able to export each page as an HTML document and view it like a normal website. (something like Generate Prototype functionality of Axure).\nThis functionality would help many UX designer who builds wireframes and prototypes to create and develop wireframes for websites very easily and quickly.\nThanks to the developers and associates who build and provided this cool wireframing tool for free.\n.

From maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com on December 15, 2008 00:06:49\nFor some exemple see in https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/source/browse/trunk/Source/Stencil/Common/Definition.xml#306 It's easy to add actions to shapes but quite impossible to add an action on shape\nthat interacts on another one. Mainly because you have no idea of the ID of the target.\n. From maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com on December 18, 2008 13:04:23\nfixed in next version\n. From dejong.a...@gmail.com on June 17, 2009 03:17:36\nTechnical details:\nThe problem lies in Pencil.boot() (Pensil.js).\nThis function invokes Pencil.postBoot() (MainWindow.js).\nPencil.postBoot() reads command line parameters and uses a timeout (100ms) to open\nthe specified document.\nHowever, after that Pencil.boot() uses a timeout to create a new empty document using\na timeout (500ms).\nAs a result the command line specified document is opened but a new document is\ncreated afterwards. Since it all happens very fast, the user won't notice.\nAnother problem is when opening a document from command line when a Pencil window is\nalready open. It seems Xulrunner now also passes \"-app\", \"application.ini\" and\n\"-console\" (no clue why), and this ends up in the file path being loaded. Of course\nthis won't load a document.\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 08:32:12\nI have fixed this in https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/issues/detail?id=215 .  I had the same issue on OS X and actually, I never saw any code to load a document based on command line arguments so I just created my own attempt and it works.\n. #215\n.

I logged out and logged back into\nmy PC using a different account (the local admin account) and everything worked fine. \nI then logged back in with my account and the issue still occurred. I then tried\nusing the 'Run as..' menu option (right click) and ran the standalone version and\nagain the issue went away.\nI seem to remember installing (and then uninstalling) an SVG image viewer a while\nago.

From ryanecr...@gmail.com on September 23, 2010 17:21:23\nI recently tried doing this again. I found the mozilla docs helpful in regards to running as an app with firefox (standalone, not plugin). Still couldn't figure out how to build a standalone app bundle though.\nTo replicate, I just grabbed the linux tarball, unzipped, and then pointed to the relevant application.ini file using the directions here - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XULRunner_tips#Using_Firefox_3_to_run_XULRunner_applications\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 08:30:42\nFor those of you monitoring this, check this out: https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/issues/detail?id=215 I have uploaded the necessary patches/files to build a standalone Pencil.app.  It includes icons for .ep/.epz files in Finder as well.  It even works in ways that the other standalone versions don't, like letting you double-click a file in Finder and have it opened/loaded in Pencil.app.  Let me know what you think.\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 08:59:54\nI went ahead and attached a pre-built Pencil.app that should work.  If it does not, you can install the XULRunner for OS X and it will work.  (If it doesn't work, update 215 and I'll fix it as I have a minor concern that I might have to include the whole XUL.framework in the .app.)\n.

From obliques...@gmail.com on April 14, 2012 14:06:25\nThe problem stencil is available but hidden. At some point you clicked the x in the top right corner, thus closing that collection. Right-click within the Collections window and select Show Hidden Collections. You will find them all there.\n. From rolf.hem...@gmail.com on October 07, 2013 02:44:08\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Download one stencil, the Dojo one is fine.\n2. Try to install it in Pencil 2.05\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe stencil is not installed. It gives \"Error installing collection\". \nA similar error message is known if I try to install an already-installed Template by \"Tools / Manage Export Template\u2026\", button \"Install New Template\u2026\", where it is right. \nHere such error message is not right, as there is no name conflict, if a Stencil is not yet installed, or installed manually.\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nI'm using the standalone version of Pencil 2.05 on Win7 ( I got Firefox 22 installed, with which the Firefox plugin does no work )\nA workaround is to install the stencils manually:\n1. Extract the archives in \u201d/Pencil/Stencils\u201d directory.\n2. For the standolone (xulrunner) version:\nBy example, on win7 by default: \u201d%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Pencil\\Profiles{your-profile-name}\\Pencil\\Stencils\u201d\n3. For the Firefox extension version:\nBy example, on win7 by default: \u201d%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles{your-profile-name}\\Pencil\\Stencils\u201d\n4. Each Stencil has its own a directory in this directory, with a \u201cDefinition.xml\u201d file (and some other optional files).\nBy example:\n\u201d[\u2026]\\Pencil\\Stencils\\ExtJs.GUI_v11\\Definition.xml\u201d.\n\u201d[\u2026]\\Pencil\\Stencils\\ExtJs.GUI_v11\\Icons[\u2026]\u201d.\n.

From eliasdor...@gmail.com on March 28, 2012 07:35:27\nI looked at the source code, and I think I figured out this problem: there are two functions that creates DOMElements: one in Common/Utils.js and other in Behaviour/CommonFunctions.js\nThe property _html (which is set in the Definition.xml for the Table Element) is used only by the method in Common/Utils.js, but the method used to draw the Table Element is the one in CommonFunctions.js.\nI just copied the same treatment for the property _html in the method in CommonFunctions.js to make it work (3 lines diff attached), but a nicer solution will probably require some refactoring.\nAttachment: use_spec_html.diff\n.

For example I can start a bullet list but can only put one item in the list, as soon as I try and hit return to start another bullet, it takes the rich text box out of edit mode. I was able to copy/paste text into the rich text box as a workaround so the rich text box does appear to work once you can get complex text into it.\n.

I use a Mac at work and have grown accustomed to using the \"backspace\" (labeled as delete) key when trying to delete elements.

From turk...@gmail.com on August 16, 2010 13:31:26\nA temporary workaround is actually possible.  It's possible to open Pencil as a plugin in Firefox and the desktop version at the same time.

From Jes.Carl...@gmail.com on July 11, 2011 03:58:31\nI didn't see this thread before I posted my own request for the feature.\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.

On what operating system?\nVersion 1.2 on Windows 7\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI propose introducing a flexible scrolling mode across canvas, like seen in most Adobe products (and in wireframing tools like Balsamiq Mockups, Cacoo, etc.).\nIn Cacoo, you can hold down the SPACE bar on the keyboard, enabling the user to drag (scrolling) the canvas by dragging w/ mouse. This is a very convenient way of quickly navigating a large canvas, instead of having to drag the scrollbars.\n.

However, they are not that visible in the GUI.\n. From sebastiangaul@gmail.com on February 27, 2012 03:16:28\nDo you mean keyboard shortcuts are added? Is this documented? Which is the shortcut for \"send backward\" and \"bring forward\"?\n. From lukas.ry...@gmail.com on May 12, 2012 06:32:49\nHi, I've create a fork of Pencil and I've added shortcuts into a context menu. You can download build from Github https://github.com/LukasRychtecky/pencil\n. From sebastiangaul@gmail.com on May 12, 2012 08:56:15\nThis issue is about managing different layers, to be exact about shortcuts for sending an element backward or bringing it forward.\nFor me your added shortcuts aren't important. Quit is fine but rarely used and \"delete\" is more apropriate for \"deleting\" things than backspace, isn't it?\n. From lukas.ry...@gmail.com on May 12, 2012 09:17:48\nYes, I know. But many users don't know about shortcut for sending an element backward or bringing it forward. Because they can't see shortcuts in a context menu - I've added for better usage.\nYou're right. \"Delete\" is native, but on MacOSX there is no \"delete key\" and I must pres fn + backspace. For me (and I hope also for other Mac users) is more efficient use backspace than fn + backspace.\n. From sebastiangaul@gmail.com on May 12, 2012 09:25:58\nOkay, didn't know that. Macs do not have a native delete key? Another reason to avoid Apple machines ;)\n. From jacob...@gmail.com on January 29, 2013 15:05:52\nMacbooks have a delete key (which is actually \"backspace\"). I think they got this one right (delete forward is less frequently used ;). Anyway, ideological arguments it would be great if the keyboard mappings were either configurable or mapped to platform-specific idioms. Along these lines, I expect the command key to do much of what \"ctrl\" is used for (ctrl-c vs. command-c).\n. PageUp/Down will do this. Holding Shift will send it all the way to the front or back.\n. From przemysl...@gmail.com on July 25, 2010 06:51:47\nI confirm the same thing on Kubuntu 10.04 32-bit.

(tar -zxf Pencil.app.tar.gz)\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 11:40:58\nSo...it seems that you do have to install the XULRunner OS X bundle for this to work.  There are two options:\n1) Provide an installer that installes XULRunner and Pencil.app\n2) Bundle XUL.framework with Pencil.app\nI've tested that #2 works but #1 would require more work to actually create the OS X PackageMaker project and automate it.\nUnfortunately, to test this you either need to install XULRunner, so that you have /Library/Frameworks/XUL.framework, or I need to upload a 19MB Pencil.app.tar.gz somewhere.\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 12:26:45\nHere is the standalone download link: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/479971/Pencil.app.tar.gz Of course, having to include the XUL.framework changes the build.xml and the content of the Build/MacOS contents.  I will hold off attaching a new Build_MacOS.tar.gz and osx_support_and_desktop_fixes.diff until we know that we have a working package and we can agree on how to package this.\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 13:37:32\nI'm not sure if you guys can tell but I've deleted the attachments.  The reason for this is I have created a discussion in the Pencil Users group to discuss my contributions and the packaging of such.  After finding that XUL.framework needed to be packaged into Pencil.app to run, my previous attachments were obsolete.  That and the fact that the discussion could seriously change the patch and files added, I have decided to just remove them.  The link to the standalone/complete Pencil.app is still valid.  Comments welcome.\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 13:37:44\nHere is the link to the discussion: http://groups.google.com/group/pencil-user/browse_thread/thread/46046f81a5bcefe4\n. From ryanecr...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 17:46:20\ni can't get your standalone app to run - it just tells me that there is already an instance running (which there isn't)\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 21:12:10\nI have a handful of people test the Pencil.app in comment #3 and it worked great for them.  Based on the message, I'd assume that you have Firefox running and the Pencil extension installed/active when you got this but before I making any assumptions, I'll do more digging.  Can you give me anymore information?  (OS version, CPU type, was Firefox running, etc.)\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 24, 2010 21:23:08\nI've found a few instance on Google where people are reporting this with XULRunner applications but I can't seem to reproduce it.  Here are the scenarios I tried:\n1) Launched Firefox (without Pencil opened in Firefox) and opened Pencil.app\n2) Launched Firefox, opened Pencil in Firefox and opened Pencil.app\n3) Launched Pencil.app and tried to launch another Pencil.app\n4) Launched Pencil.app and then tried to open a .ep file from the Terminal\nI really will need more information before I can see what the problem is.\n. From jak.spalding on October 06, 2010 12:18:21\nNo issues with your particular build. No Firefox or XULRunner installed here on Snow Leopard.\nThanks for making it public :-)\n.

From rafik.bo...@gmail.com on October 20, 2010 04:05:58\nI've tested app in Snow Leopard in French locale and first I had the message :\nXML Parsing Error: undefined entity\nLocation: chrome://pencil/content/UI/Window.xul\nLine Number 23, Column 1:<window\nI've changed in Pencil.app/Contents/Resources/defaults/preferences/prefs.js the line :\npref(\"intl.locale.matchOS\", true);\nto\npref(\"intl.locale.matchOS\", false);\nand it's works now !

From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 23, 2011 09:05:34\nI gave up on this a long time ago when the owner of the project wouldn't address this request.  That being said, the last sources I have for this are the ones attached to the issue.  Based on the feedback I see it's been working since I created the request so I've not put anymore time into it.  I wish this would become part of the project officially but it's never happened.  Sorry.\n. From jcscoob...@gmail.com on September 29, 2011 09:51:00\nLooks like someone deleted my attachments.  I've undeleted them and they include the actual source diff to apply and the binary/new files necessary to overlay into the Pencil sources.  Like I mentioned earlier, I've never received any feedback from the Pencil developer(s) so I gave up on this a while back.  I will be glad to help where I can and I'm happy to hear it's working.\nP.S. - You figure this would be good enough feedback to get this officially applied to the project...\n.

From ahdavid...@gmail.com on May 09, 2012 13:32:15\nAs a work around you can edit the epz directly to set the proper tab to selected=\"true\" and make sure that matches up with the  entry that has the # or *. Editing the object in the Pencil GUI again will mess up the selected tab again, i.e. changing the order the pages or moving the object, not sure what else\n.

From neil.mu...@catalyse.net on November 24, 2010 15:46:50\nThis corrects it for web export, but will probably screw ODT (probably should override it in WebPageExporter.js):\nBaseRasterizedExporter.js: line 27\nattr.nodeValue = path.replace(DirIO.sep,\"/\");\nThe basic problem is that the image path is \"pages\\image.png\" which gets converted to %5C.\n.

From guilla...@metayer.ca on February 02, 2012 07:04:27\nI guess my question is relatively stupid, but how do I apply this bug fix? I applied the change to the js, with no effect... but I get the feeling the whole Pencil/app directory is not being used when I'm exporting a document. A renamed a directory for fun and the export was still working. I'm on Windows and I tried with Pencil as a Firefox plugin and stand alone program, and I still have the problem. Any idea?\n. From andrebac...@gmail.com on February 02, 2012 07:19:23\nYou will first have to extract the .xpi file (it is in reality just a .zip file).\nThen you edit BaseRasterizedExporter.js.\nAfter that, you zip the entire folder, change the file ending to .xpi and overwrite your original C:\\users\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles.default\\extensions\\pencil@evolus.vn.xpi (This is the path for Windows Vista/7, it is slightly different for XP).\n.

From dc.cebe...@gmail.com on October 19, 2010 08:25:20\nA workaround for this issue is described in issue #192 .\nIt seems there's a harcoded path somewhere in the Pencil application (or its XULRunner) that prevents it from running if it is not in the folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Evolus\".\nIf you have installed Pencil 1.2.0 somewhere else, and you don't mind the broken link in the \"Add/Remove Programs\", you can just move it to folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Evolus\\\", there is no need to uninstall and reinstall it.\nP.S. It would be nice to also have pencil-application-only-zip for \"installing\" it along the existing XULRunner - I keep the Pencil with my other Portable Applications.\n. From dc.cebe...@gmail.com on October 19, 2010 08:42:18\nActually, the only requirement is that it's under \"C:\\Program Files\", so any of these will work:\n- \"C:\\Program Files\\Evolus\\Pencil\"\n- \"C:\\Program Files\\Pencil\"\n- \"C:\\Program Files\\My\\Scribler\"\n.

The same problem occurs in Ubuntu. Moving a page makes the whole app dim for seconds, even on Core i5 2.66 GHz with 4GB RAM. Also, when I make a series of pages and then want to add a new one next to the first tab in the tab menu, I have to click \"Move left\" like 20 times which takes up to 5 minutes. \nThat is way too long.\n. From lindseyb...@gmail.com on March 13, 2012 14:52:14\nI completely agree! I am using Pencil to layout an application with many screens. It's becoming quite frustrating to have to keep moving each tab back/forth to get the right page placement.\n. From leozleoz01@gmail.com on October 10, 2012 02:49:32\nI agree as well. It might be easier to add an entry in the top left menu to move a tab before or after a particular tab. Indeed with 50 pages it becomes very long to move a tab\n. From leozleoz01@gmail.com on October 10, 2012 02:54:05\nI just thought, a layer windows for tabs (and for elements as well because managing the z-index of elements with only one menu is horrible) like photoshop or paint.net would be awesome!\n.

From Robert.K...@gmail.com on January 24, 2011 01:36:53\nI would love to have this through the UI, but until then I've written a small XSLT-Sheet that basically only strips everything from the http://www.evolus.vn/Namespace/Pencil namespace (Mostly management data not needed in an export anyway). The resulting file should work fine in Firefox (where the foreignObject tag of SVG is well supported), but libraries like batik (used in apache fop for example) will have trouble with the XHTML, XUL or XLink in it. I intend to extend the sheet to support at least a few of those elements I encounter, but I won't make promises I can't keep ;-)\nThe file attached can also be found as part of my collection of tools (used to generate DocBook and then PDF for my projects): https://github.com/Robert-Kosten/de.robertkosten.tools/blob/master/xsl/ep2svg.xsl It is currently under GPLv3, but I'd be willing to release it under GPLv2 so no-one has to invoke \"any later version\" should anyone wish to include it in their software ;-)\nAttachment: ep2svg.xsl\n.

I think instead the arrangement of a new group should be flattened to the lowest arrangement of the group.

From psychol...@gmail.com on November 22, 2011 08:01:06\nNote: A temporary workaround is to manually add the collections inside the \\app\\content\\pencil\\definition\\collectionManager.js file after the system stencils (around line 100).\n(You need to extract the zip files first to a location, preferrably inside the pencil directory structure.)\n. From psychol...@gmail.com on November 22, 2011 08:07:33\nIn case anybody is not familiar with basic JavaScript do the following:\nCreate a new directory for the stencil inside the Pencil program directory, for me Windows 7 x64 this is:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\content\\pencil\\stencil\\\ne.g. Glyphish: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\content\\pencil\\stencil\\Glyphish\nNow extract the stencil zip file inside the directory.\nNext open \\app\\content\\pencil\\definition\\collectionManager.js with an editor (e.g. notepad) and go to line 100.\nThere you should see a line like like the following:\nCollectionManager.addShapeDefCollection(parser.parseURL(\"chrome://pencil/content/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\"));\nNow copy that line and paste it below. Change the path to the right so it points to your newly unzipped directory, like so:\nCollectionManager.addShapeDefCollection(parser.parseURL(\"chrome://pencil/content/stencil/Glyphish/Definition.xml\"));\nNext time Pencil starts the colleciton is loaded.\n.

I had trouble using this solution simply because of the size of the file generated by Pencil (~15MB of XML!). Using gVim, I was able to access the files, but then found that large portions of the file had been lost at the point of failure (Windows XP blue screen of death).\nThis is a particularly annoying error / bug given that I saved constantly throughout the build process. At the point of failure, large portions of the file were corrupted and entire pages within the file lost.\nOverall, I've unfortunately found Pencil to be full of bugs and I am constantly having to allow for it's unusual behaviour and instability.\n. From david.j....@gmail.com on April 29, 2013 05:00:45\nI also had a similar problem when the program crashed in windows. I managed to change the file extension to xml, check the problem with XML copy editor ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml-copy-editor/?source=dlp ) and delete the corrupted parts and add the missing tags. Then changed the filename back to .ep and it was fine. Lost only one image. So thanks for the tip.\n. From AWJDThor...@gmail.com on May 20, 2013 17:07:24\nThanks. This worked for me as well.

I'm using version 2.0.3 on Windows 8.\nAs a workaround, setting the text alignment to something else then setting it back to left aligned seems to fix it, though you may have to print twice before it picks up a change (that seems to be another bug, which I'll scan for and raise when I can).\n. @AntonyOJ Please use the issue tracker at https://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3 things..

From petsu...@gmail.com on June 06, 2013 12:29:45\nThe problem is xulrunner needs application.ini as a parameter, but recent Windows versions (at least Win7 and Win8) really don't make that easy.\nI used this rather convoluted way: (WARNING Don't do this if you are not sure what you are doing. Create backups / restore points. Be careful. Do this at your own risk. Etc.)\n1. Run regedit. Find and delete all keys that map .ep to xulrunner.exe / pencil.exe.\n2. Open a Command Prompt (cmd.exe) as an Administrator. Type the following commands:\nassoc .ep=epfile\nftype epfile=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\xulrunner\\xulrunner.exe\" \n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\application.ini\" \"%1\"\nregsvr32 /i shell32.dll\nGood luck.

From avrelian...@gmail.com on July 14, 2013 08:05:22\n@petsuter\nMaybe something has changed a little bit since your previous comment but I've solved the problem on Windows 8/64 simply by inserting string \n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\xulrunner\\xulrunner.exe\" \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\application.ini\" \"%1\"\ninto \"File name\" field of the \"Open with...\" dialog window\n1) Right click on .ep file\n2) \"Open with\" -> \"Choose default program...\"\n3) \"More options\"\n4) \"Look for another app on this PC\"\nThank you for the workaround\n. From james.g....@gmail.com on September 14, 2012 16:50:36\nThis is identical to issue #467 (or 467 is a duplicate of this one). \nIt appears the problem is related to the speed of the drag action.

From bpursley...@gmail.com on June 07, 2012 09:10:27\nI guess I should have explained a little more about this.  I was having problems getting tables with more than a couple of rows to display correctly.  The table grid was not drawn the same as the text, so it would be out of alignment.  It also was not shading the header correctly and the X-position of the columns was slightly off.  I think I was able to fix most of the display problems with the table.\nThe increase of column count maximum from 12 to 20 is unrelated to the display problems above, was just due to my need to be able to show more columns.\n. From bpursley...@gmail.com on June 08, 2012 08:59:02\nI just noticed that a similar fix for table layout issues has already been done in the 2.0 branch of the code.  So in that case, it probably does not make sense to include this patch at this point.  (Although I still would appreciate the maximum column limit to be increased to allow more than 12 column).\n.

From jpmdserv...@gmail.com on November 28, 2012 18:33:28\nHello,\nI was having the same issues but I have figured it out (at least it works for me)...after the copy/paste function would randomly disappear and my frustration grew I decided to test out a few ideas. I'm running the stand alone version Evolus 2.02 not the built in Firefox version. Basically, if the Firefox browser is not running then I'm unable to copy and paste. Every time I load up Firefox the copy/paste starts working. I should also mention that I didn't have this problem until I recently upgraded to the newest version of Evolus. My previous versions worked fine.\nAnyhow, hope this works for the rest of you....and Thanks to the Evolus team for a great application.\nGood luck and Peace,\nPaul\n.

From rartdesi...@gmail.com on October 17, 2012 03:26:02\nActually there is. At the time it happened to me I was so frustrated I didn't think of this. Files aren't completly deleted from the hard disk even when you remove them from recycle bin; they are labeled as deleted so that the system is free to overwrite them when it needs it.\nThere are different softwares out there that scans your hard drives for deleted files\n(I used Recuva - http://www.piriform.com/recuva ). I don't know if there are other best software out there, this one was recommended by a friend too and it worked for me... eccept from a collection of large \"*.mpg\" practically the copy of one year of of recordings from my video-camera's memory. Precious moments, all gone...forever.\nBut is highly recommended that you use a recover software right after the deletion was made in order to increase your chances of success (or as soon as possible and trying not to make to many operations or reboot the system).\nThe irony is that by just searching and downloading the desired file recovery software you may overwrite important data.\nI wish you all the best.\nHope you recover all the files you need.\n. From rartdesi...@gmail.com on October 17, 2012 03:30:59\nPS: try not to download the software in the location your files were lost.\n(not that this will ensure you that they wont be rewrited but it can increase your chances).\n.

From james.g....@gmail.com on September 14, 2012 16:38:54\nI have this problem under Windows 7 64-bit standalone and under Ubuntu 12.04 running via Firefox (15.0.1). Problem appears to be specific to what is being dragged. Some objects refuse to drag at all. Some will work on a new page but then fail as soon as something else is added. There doesn't appear to be any clear reason why.\nSteps to reproduce running within firefox on Ubuntu 12.04.\n1. Create new page.\n2. Drag Rectangle on to page.\n3. Drag oval onto page.\nStep 3 fails. It cannot be dragged onto the page. Attempting to add a new rectangle also fails until a new page is open.\nEffectively the problem makes Pencil unusable both under Windows 7 (64-bit) as standalone and within Firefox under Ubutnu 12.04. \nI would suggest that the priority is increased from medium to a higher level as currently the tool is unusable in the environments I have tested.\n. From james.g....@gmail.com on September 14, 2012 16:46:44\nWhile doing further testing have determined that under the Ubuntu 12.04/Firefox environment that the drag failure is related to the speed of the drag operation. \nIf the drag is slow enough then the drag to add a shape to the page works 100% of the time.\nIf the drag action is above a certain speed then the drag fails.\nThis appears to be the reason why it's hard to recreate as speed of the drag operation is what affects the failure of the page to become a target. It appears that what happens is the page is made a target of the drag operation briefly, but then the page is removed as a drag target, thus stopping the drag operation to work. \nThe work around is to drag slowly. It is possible that this is a problem for people who have enabled fast acceleration of their mouse (which I have, on both environments). The reason for enabling fast acceleration is because on environment makes use of a 30 inch monitor and the other uses two large monitors.\n. See #802, #856 .

Evolus still has their stencil development guide up:\nhttp://pencil.evolus.vn/wiki/devguide/Introduction.html\n. That'd be awesome! \nMuch of my time has been spent reading, comprehending, fixing & cleaning all this code. So it'll probably be a while before I get ready to learn about & tackle issues for stencils - any help is appreciated :)\nDon't feel obligated to wait for #676 to update the docs - anything changed in the repo will get updated when I convert everything. But don't feel obligated to do it now either... Just don't feel obligated in general :P\nIf you like, we could merge your Android stencils so they're included in every Pencil install. Although I've wondered why the original authors decided to distribute zips of contributed stencils instead of just merging them into the repo. Maybe there is a good reason for it, maybe not...\n. Yeah, I figured it might be easier for stencil maintainers if they were in a different repository. I was first thinking I could simply add the submodules under the appropriate directory in the app folder, but that wouldn't work for collections like your Material Icons - which need to be built. Maybe I'll modify the build script to download, include(and build, if necessary) any 3rd party stencils when building the application.\nDo you know if it's possible for users to override a collection if the collection already exists within Pencil's code?\n. I've split those out into #677 and #678 \n. Closing, nathielw's stencil collection solves this :)\n.

Although now I'm thinking maybe this wasn't necessary...\nIt seems like pencil-animation turned into pencil2d & started storing stuff in /opt/ instead of /usr/.\nDoes anyone still need this?\n. Well my now main concern is that this fork has nothing to do with Evolus, so I think it would be best to change it to pencil or pencil-prototyping or something along those lines. \nI did some more digging & the original pencil animation project the OP was submitting died & was forked into this: http://www.pencil2d.org/\nI downloaded the package for the 0.5.4 release & it looks like the executable & the folder is named pencil2d now, so I think it is safe to switch back to using just pencil for the data - unless there is another linux app with the name pencil(I didn't find one on Arch or Nix).\n.

It is probably related to the PDF fonts since this is able to be recreated by print to PDF for Acrobat.\nTo fix the print Acrobat with corrupted fonts, you need to uncheck the box in the print dialog for 'Rely on system fonts only; do not use document fonts'.\nI would wonder if this is only on Windows 7 and does anyone else have Acrobat Pro installed? Could be related. Is Pencil using system fonts and not embedding the font in the PDF? Sounds likely.\nFix works to print to PDF manually without using the export tool. Objects are vector and font is a real font that is editable in the PDF direction with Acrobat Pro.\nBug might not get fixed if this functionality works.\nSuggest removing the export to PDF functionality for now.\n.

When I click on it to launch Pencil it does so correctly, but it displays in the Windows taskbar as a new Pencil icon (see attached screenshot double-icon.bmp).\n- when Pencil is already running, and I pin Pencil to my taskbar (by right-clicking its taskbar icon and choosing \"Pin this program to taskbar\") I see what the original reporter saw (the icon changes to the blue globe icon for xulrunner.exe and when you click on it to launch Pencil it instead displays the standard xulrunner usage message box - see attached screenshot xulrunner.bmp).\nAttachment: double-icon.bmp xulrunner.bmp\n.

It's not as easy as using Stencils in Pencil, but it's close.\nInstall\n1) Download the latest zip-file form the Font Awesome page ( http://fontawesome.io/ )\n2) Extract the zip-file and install FontAwesome.otf font on your computer\n3) Save the Cheatsheet page as PDF ( http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/ )\nUse in Pencil\n1) Open Pencil and create a new text area (Simple or Rich)\n2) Choose Font Awesome as font\n3) Copy and past a icon from the Cheatsheet PDF (Not icon class or unicode)\nSit back and enjoy :-)\n.

My work around is to open pencil in a VM to get to my diagrams. \nProcess:         xulrunner [2043]\nPath:            /Applications/Pencil.app/Contents/Frameworks/XUL.framework/Versions/17.0/xulrunner\nIdentifier:      vn.evolus.pencil\nVersion:         2.0 (2.0.3)\nCode Type:       X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process:  sh [2035]\nResponsible:     sh [2035]\nUser ID:         501\nDate/Time:       2013-10-25 07:03:09.609 -0500\nOS Version:      Mac OS X 10.9 (13A603)\n.

From rfd...@gmail.com on February 06, 2014 12:01:09\nAfter inspecting the saved file I noticed some weird \"font-size: 0px\" styles. After removing these styles the project opened correctly. The problem seems to be in file https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/source/browse/branches/pencil-2.0/app/content/pencil/stencil/Native.GUI/Definition.xml where the elements are defined with \"font-size: 0px\". Removing the \"font-size: 0px\" from every element fixed the problem for me.\n. From jeanbapt...@gmail.com on November 04, 2013 08:15:29\nI reproduce the problem as well. Are there any debug step we should perform to help track down the issue ?\n. From jeanbapt...@gmail.com on November 04, 2013 08:20:30\nHum, there's a solution in #591 ; this one should be closed imho\n. From Martin.O...@gmail.com on November 11, 2013 01:11:54\nNo, #591 did not solve this yet; it offers as workaround \"to run the pencil Firefox extension\". The native OS X Pencil application still crashes under Mavericks.\n. From ngtdungnt@gmail.com on November 11, 2013 01:50:38\nStatus: Duplicate\nMergedinto: 591\n. From sampur...@gmail.com on November 12, 2013 14:37:44\nI have similar issue in my in Pencil installation. Description of the problem and the version of the software are exactly same as the issue reported by  rajwinde. Does any one have a solution for this.\nThanks and regards,\nSubbu\n. From murderye...@gmail.com on November 13, 2013 03:41:56\nWe have the same error, there is no button for \"redraw\" and it is very unpleasant. It would be convenient see a three of the components that are in the paint.\n. From dima...@gmail.com on December 05, 2013 11:24:23\nI have the same issue reported here, I am using Ubuntu and Pencil 2.0.5. What I have to do to make them appear is right click and toggle \"disabled\", it is easier than trying to click and edit some text for it to render again. It is really annoying because it happens with the radio buttons too, the text is simply gone and its every time I open an .ep file. This seems to be related to issue #548\nAttachment: Screenshot from 2013-12-05 11:11:32.png Screenshot from 2013-12-05 11:13:26.png\n. From omar.pi...@gmail.com on December 08, 2013 23:53:13\nWith Pencil 2.0.3 there is no problem\n. From dima...@gmail.com on December 14, 2013 13:32:42\nThanks for hte tip. I have the same issue with 2.0.3 using the default xulrunner. The fix I used for 2.0.3 (not sure it works for 2.0.5) is to point Pencil to a different xulrunner (something greater than xulrunner 1.9.8) , I chose xulrunner 2.0.0 from here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/ then modified the /usr/bin/pencil script to look like this:\n!/bin/sh\n/usr/bin/firefox --app \"/usr/share/pencil/application.ini\"\n/home/installed/xulrunner/2.0.0/xulrunner  --app \"/usr/share/pencil/application.ini\"\n. From calin.ci...@gmail.com on January 07, 2014 09:00:01\nWhen the \"Disable\" menu is unavailable another way to make the text visible again is to:\n1. Select All\n2. Right click and open Properties\n3. Select the Black color and make sure the Opacity is set to 100%.\n4. Apply\n. From joejcoll...@gmail.com on January 15, 2014 04:50:38\nRolling back to Pencil 2.0.3 from 2.0.5, resolved this issue for me on Windows 7.\n. From gomes.vi...@gmail.com on April 02, 2014 08:21:40\nBack to 2.0.3 ...\n. From camel.ai...@gmail.com on May 22, 2014 01:49:26\nBack to 2.0.3. I think it is a high issue not a medium.\n. From vetj...@gmail.com on June 25, 2014 02:52:17\nBack to 2.0.3. helped me as well (Windows 7)\n. From francisc...@gmail.com on June 27, 2014 02:23:12\nI did what was suggested here by calin.ci...@gmail.com, it makes the text visible at Pencil, but it prints everything blank, I rolled back to 2.0.3, the text is visible as described, but it still prints blank (I don't know if file formats have changed from 2.0.3 to 2.0.5 so I've created a new document at 2.0.3 added a few \"Desktop - Native UI Widgets\" these print blank and added \"Flowchart\" elements these print fine).\nFinally I had to \"Export page as PNG\", and printed from there.\n. From malvineous on July 15, 2014 21:46:42\nFYI this is a duplicate of issue #579\n. From Jacek.Ma...@gmail.com on August 08, 2014 00:56:47\nSame situation here. Rolling back to 2.0.3 on MacOSX Mavericks did not solve the problem. Same thing happens when I open the files with the Firefox plugin. As a workaround, I installed Pencil 2.0.3 on Win XP virtual machine and I can see all widgets correctly.\nIt's funny, because if I resize a widget it becomes visible, but when I undo the resize operation, again it \"magically disappears\". \nThis indeed should have a high priority. I have some mockups with dozens of widgets and resizing them all separately is really impossible.\n. From djati.sa...@gmail.com on September 19, 2014 22:13:00\nI Had the same issue too but to quick fix you may select all object by selecting CTRL + A then change the font for example arial. But you must change each page one by one.\n. From aamirhab...@gmail.com on November 27, 2014 23:32:13\nIssue resolved by following the technique specified by  #15 djati.sa...@gmail.com. Many Thanks to him. But its not permanent solution. Bug fixes are required in ver. 2.0.5\n. From gomes.vi...@gmail.com on November 28, 2014 00:33:25\nAnother solution : don't use the \"Label\" element from \"Desktop - Native UI Widgets\".\n. From vesselin...@gmail.com on December 13, 2014 22:02:00\nSame problem here with 2.0.5 and native desktop widgets. Going back to 2.0.3 did not fix the problem.\nAnother workaround - select all items on the page and then use \"Location & size\" to move them one pixel to the left and then one pixel to the right. After you unselect the items, they are redrawn and look OK.\n. From laura.wh...@gmail.com on January 15, 2015 19:07:31\nSame problem on osx 10.10.1 - Cant downgrade to 2.0.3 cause it crashes.\nIt also happens when i copy and paste a group of elements from one page to another.\n. From thakural...@gmail.com on March 09, 2015 06:46:21\nAs mentioned in one of the comments above as well follow the following steps \nwhen you will open a .ep file in Pencil\n1. Click any control within designer area (windows form, group box, text control)\n2. Press CTRL + A (select all)\n3. Right click and Go to properties\n4. You will get Multiple objects properties window\n5. Select check box colour above check box Advance mode is colour picker is disabled\n6. Select black colour and set opacity 100% (slider control is there)\nAll the texts will be visible\n(y)\n. Going through previous issues, it looks like this only affects the Native UI Stencil Collection & is fixed by reverting to 2.0.3. Maybe diffing HEAD against v2.0.3 will show the issue.\n. Backgrounds, shapes & labels are messed up in exports until the Page's tab is selected as well.\n. Many hours have been sunk into this - no resolution yet. \nI've been looking at how Pencil loads the initial document - but it might be a problem with the stencils themselves instead.\n. Poked at this some more... doesn't seem like a notable difference between the Stencil Definitions of the working Sketchy Labels & the broken Native Labels.\nI poked around at the Shape prototype for a little & will probably pick up my investigation there.\nOn the plus side, I'm learning tons about the codebase as I slowly comb through everything to figure this out...\n. @amarach78 You can grab the old source from the google code project page:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/downloads/list\nThe fact that I didn't find anything in the diff might mean that some change in the xulrunner/firefox framework caused this issue instead of some code in this repo. Or maybe I just missed something.\n. That's great, thanks. The next step is to figure out the version of xulrunner that broke the native stencils so we can look at the release notes for that version & figure out what changed and broke the stencils.\nI might be able to get to that in the next few days(unless you're interested in taking it on). \n. Thanks, I'll checkout the update notes for xul 17 and try poking around again.\n. Sorry all, been trying really hard to fix this... \nI can't find anything about using native GUI widgets in XUL. Can't even seem to find the release notes for XRE v17 to see what changed :( I think the last resort may have to be diffing the whole codebase from v16.0.2 -> v17 and pick through to see what might've broken this...\n. @mvdw It's a XUL button, not an HTML button:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/button\nHTML button would be marked up like <html:button>...</html:button>\n. I was able to get button text to load by removing the font-size:0px; from the surrounding html:div element in the stencil:\nxml\n<html:div xmlns:html=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"div\" style=\"-moz-box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; position: relative; line-height: 1px !important; font-size: 0px;\" xmlns=\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\">\n    <button id=\"xulControl\"\n            style=\"margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;\" />\n    <html:div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"/>\n</html:div>\nHowever, the loaded button's styling is different and changes when you edit it's text...\nMore digging to go...\n.

From MEL_Lang...@yahoo.co.uk on November 12, 2013 03:49:57\nThanks.\nI did try to use the FireFox plugin and also discovered that the only way I could re-load the document I had created was to use the \u201crecent\u201d documents list.\nUnfortunately there is a bigger problem with the Fire Fox plugin in that after creating a wireframe design, when I attempt to reload it all I get is a single vertical line, about 3\u201d long, in the middle of the layout area where my design should be.\nThe only workaround that I am left with is to spin up a VM on my mac and run evoluspencil from that.\n.

I appreciate any time spent on this :)\nFor setting up the initial structure, see: http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html\nMost of the docs will most likely be just plain RST: http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html\nAlthough additional Sphinx constructs may be useful: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/index.html\nYou can ignore all the autodoc, cross-referencing & javascript domain stuff for now(although if sphinx-quickstart asks please switch the default domain to javascript).\nThanks & let me know if you run into any problems!\n. Awesome!\nFor links to sections, I'd recommend adding a label before the section header & linking to that using ref, instead of using rst links.\nFrom: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html#ref-role\nUsing ref is advised over standard reStructuredText links to sections (like\n`Section title`_) because it works across files, when section headings are\nchanged, and for all builders that support cross-references.\n. Live at http://pencil-prototyping.rtfd.org\nGonna do a little cross-referencing & re-organization before closing this.\n. Welp that last commit makes it show tutorial pages in the sidebar when you build them locally - for some reason RTDs doesn't pick up the template override. I will investigate...\n. @nathanielw The online docs now have the sidebar nesting you requested: https://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/devguide/tutorial/index.html\nI've also reviewed & added cross-references to the Reference guide.\nI think that pretty much wraps up this ticket, but I haven't developed a Stencil yet so I don't know what would be super useful to include. Additional feedback welcome, otherwise I'll close this off in a couple of days.\n. At some point I'll move the less useful docs out of the readme & into sphinx(like maintainer-only info), but I'm going to go ahead & close this now.\n. If we were to use JSON I think it'd be best to have something like this:\njson\n[\n  { \"name\": \"Material Icons\",\n    \"repo\": \"http://github.com/nathanielw/Material-Icons-for-Pencil.git\",\n    \"buildCommand\": \"\",\n  },\n]\nThat way:\n- we can use name to determine the folder to create in the content/pencil/stencil/ folder(stripping spaces or replacing them with underscores)\n- the repo isn't tied to github\n- a buildCommand can be specified, or left blank to indicate no building is required\nWe would have to pick some cli utility to parse the JSON file for use in build.sh (jq or jshon come to mind - not sure which is more popular).\nAs an aside: I'd really love to use YAML instead of JSON for human-edited things like this, but the dearth of YAML CLI utilities makes this seem improbable.\nIf we go with submodules, we'd probably stick them somewhere like build/Stencils/ & copy the folders directly(so we wouldn't need a name).  We could check for a Definition.xml file to figure out whether the collection needs to be built or not. I think the build commands would have to be hardcoded into build.sh - unless we asked stencil devs to have a standardized build file for us to hook up to. Updating the submodules would have to become part of the release process(git submodule foreach git pull origin master).\nSo it seems like JSON would be more maintainable & expandable, although it would add a little more knowledge overhead for comprehending the build system(knowing JSON & whatever utility we use to parse it).\n. Sorry I didn't mean to make it seem like I was against using JSON, I just wanted to list out the pros & cons, so I could think on it. I think it's an OK trade off, but I imagined it would only be knowledge required for Pencil's developers/maintainers & stencil developers. So this little bit confuses me:\n\nusers wouldn't need the overhead of knowing a new markup language really\n\nAre you saying we should let end-users install collections by adding a username & repo in a config file, similar to antigen or vim-plug?\nI'm thinking of something like getting stencil devs to supply a manifest.json with their collection that contains a bunch of metadata, including the following attributes:\n- name\n- version \n- downloadUrl\n- requiresBuild\n- buildCommands\n- manifestUrl\nFor including collections with Pencil, we just add the repo to a file in build/. The build script can clone/update all repos listed in the file & check the manifest.json to see if a build is required.\n- If requiresBuild is true & buildCommands doesn't exist, the script will download the pre-built zip from downloadUrl(into some location dependent on the version in order to prevent redundant downloads). If buildCommands exists, the script will instead run them inside the cloned folder.\n- If requiresBuild is false, it'll just copy the files into Outputs/Pencil/.../stencil/${name} where ${name} comes from manifest.json.\nWe can also eventually expand this into something that allows users to easily install & auto-upgrade collections. Users could enter a file path or url to a manifest.json or the collection's .zip. Pencil would download & compare manifestUrl to see if a newer version is available & download that using the downloadUrl instead. Then it could be handled like regular zip imports. For automatic updates, Pencil could compare the manfiest at manifestUrl to the installed manifest.json, if the version differs, it would automatically download & replace the collection from downloadUrl.\nThen, way in the future, we can use the manifest.json to create a Pencil Stencil Repository or something similar, where stencil devs can upload their manifest.json, screenshots, the collection's .zip, etc to some server. We could add a window to Pencil that talks to the server and fetches the manifest.jsons and allows the user to browse, search & install all collections listed in the repository.\nThis heavily rips off of how firefox does addons, here's an example of what firefox stores(in your profile's addons.json): https://gist.github.com/prikhi/795a025c829b45769aa7\nComments? Suggestions? Feedback?\nI'd also love to hear from @nathanielw about all this, as he's the only active stencil developer I know of :P\n. I'm fine with ditching building collections, I only imagined building collections when building Pencil - not when users update or install a collection. The only benefit I saw(which seems small) was that whenever I build/release a new version of Pencil it would include the latest versions of the bundled collections instead of the last released ones.\n. On Sun, Apr 26, 2015 at 05:54:35AM -0700, Jay Looney wrote:\n\n@prikhi So, only add it if there is demand?\nYeah seems fine to me.\n. > talking about \"Bundled Collections\" are you referring to a collection that you install all at once as a group, or the collection that distributes with pencil itself\n\nBy Bundled Collections, I meant 3rd-party collections that would eventually be included by #677. \nIn general this ticket was meant for both(I believe Pencil treats them equally under the hood but I haven't completely immersed myself in the stencil collection code yet). But now that I think about it, the latter isn't as big a deal - I'm failing to come up with reasonable circumstances where someone might want to replace a built-in collection instead of just upgrading(maybe an incompatible version of FF/XR?).\n\nit wouldn't be too difficult to build a dependency management solution\n\nBy dependency management, do you mean version management? As far as I know there aren't dependencies between stencil collections(where one collection requires that another is installed).\nI was thinking stencil collections could have a version/last-updated/modified attribute or something similar, and Pencil could ensure you only replace a collection with a collection that has a higher version number. I don't see versioning as a necessary requirement for this ticket, we could just let users replace a collection with any version of that collection.\n. Sorry I misspoke as well, I meant to say this ticket was meant for all collections - built-in collections, bundled collections, and user-created/installed collections.\n\nIf we base it on github repositories it can easily check if there is an update to the repository and grab it automatically.\n...\nThen it would be as simple as running a git pull on each collection to update when the application is launching.\n\nWhile I'm not opposed to automatically updating stencil collections, I meant for this issue to be more about allowing end-users to manually replace them on their individual installation/profile instead of requiring the stencil to be uninstalled first. So it seems to me to be a bit out of scope for this issue(correct me if I'm misunderstanding), but feel free to create a new issue for it if you'd like(or I can when I have some more free time).\n. Actually you can scroll to switch pages, but if you scroll past all pages that are currently displayed, the tab bar does not scroll to follow you.\n. Beautiful, thanks :)\nI built it on rtfd.org, check it out: https://evolus-pencil.readthedocs.org/en/sphinx-docs/\nStay tuned for comments.\n. Yup, pencil is taken so I changed it to pencil-prototyping, rtd is just taking its time with it.\nSeems like the only other comments I have are small knitpicks that I can just edit as I go through the diff. Could you rebase all this into a single commit? You should be able to do:\nbash\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:prikhi/pencil.git\ngit fetch upstream develop\ngit rebase -i upstream/develop\nThen mark as commits except your first one as squash & edit the commit message. Lemme know if you need more info.\n. Thanks :)\n. Thanks\n. Whew, thank you both for your doc improving efforts :)\nI will start my pass through them soon\n. Thanks :)\n. I checked out the release docs and it doesn't look like there's any breaking changes(breaking changes aren't separated out, usually have to search the page for breaking or incompatible).\nSo I've bumped it & will put out a new release & upload new builds for 2.0.9.\nAs for PRs, I'd like to keep MaxVersion on a major version that has been tested(instead of just doing MaxVersion=*). The bare minimum tests I do are:\n- Can I load a file?\n- Can I save, quit then load without losing data?\n- Can I export to PNG?\nIf you attest to testing these things, I'll take a PR that bumps MaxVersion.\n. Tada: https://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.9\n. Beautiful thanks :)\n. Merged, thanks. Do you need a new release out for this?\nIf this makes Pencil install-able for all Gentoo users, feel free to add the relevant info to the readme\n. Thanks - I'm at the very end of my awake cycle, so I'll put a new release out once I've gotten some sleep.\n. I put out v2.0.10\n. Thanks again :)\n. Can you try v2.0.10\n. @donniezazen Related commit fixes this, caused by #!/bin/sh instead of #!/bin/bash in the pencil executable.\n. This is released as v2.0.11, let me know if everything is alright.\n. Fixed by #692 \n. There should be default templates. Pencil is looking in the wrong place when installed as an extension. Fix incoming.\n. Heya, I've been away for a while so I've got a backlog of stuff in all my projects, just quickly checking in so you know you're not being ignored. I will review & merge this soon-ish.\n. How should I package the folder for downloading? Is a zip OK? Or rar, tar?\nI'd like to add install directions to the readme. How does one go about installing the downloaded file(maybe this is obvious for Mac users)?\nOtherwise, looks good thanks :)\n. I merged this but rebased it so github doesn't want to acknowledge it :/\n. > I just realised this is already addressed in #667, sorry for the duplicate.\nIt's OK, the majority of the 500 or so issues on here were imported from Evolus' old bug tracker, so any confirmation that those issues are still occurring is helpful.\nThat said, I'm closing this as a duplicate, marking #667 as confirmed & assigning it to milestone v2.1.0, please subscribe to #667 if you want updates.\n. Not sure what you mean by painter. Do you mean the color selection tool? If not, can you please clarify or give instructions on how to reproduce this behavior.\nIf you mean the color selection tool, that can be exited by pressing your Escape key.\n. The escape key is commonly used throughout the app to \"escape\" from things like nav menus, text boxes, dropdowns, popups, etc. \nI'm gonna say this isn't really worth it right now because it'd be a button just to deselect the \"Copy Shape Format\" tool. It would be useful if we add more tools where the click action is replaced.\n. There are 2 ways to do this:\n1. In the line section to the right of the color toolbar section, set the number input to 0(this controls the border width).\n2. Right click the shape & choose Actions -> Remove Border.\nDoes this seem OK?\n. If you're on Linux, you could try removing your ~/.cache/pencil folder. There's profiles in ~/.pencil as well.\n. Thanks!\n. The latest release(v2.0.11) fixes this.\n. Thanks!\n. I was thinking of something simple: a short description, download links for the current version, doc & github links and a list of features with screenshots. This could all fit on a single page so I was thinking either just HTML & CSS or using some Javascript library as well.\nI actually already did this as a way to test out mercury.js but I thought my design was a little off. Maybe mercury.js  is too obscure of a library as well... I'll push it to the gh-pages branch soon so you can see what it actually looks like.\n\n. I pushed it to the gh-pages branch, let me know what you think:\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/tree/gh-pages\nhttp://prikhi.github.io/pencil/\n. I've got the majority of it rewritten in plain HTML & bootstrap, I've just been too busy w/ other work to finish it up...\nI was thinking a simple page would be a little more \"user-friendly\" than using the docs, although that'd keep everything in one place...\n. And yeah, I didn't think we'd use mercury - that was just me playing around & I wanted to share the design.\nStatic site generators seem a little overkill to me(that's essentially what I wrote w/ mercury). Maybe I'm missing something though?\n. ^ Referenced wrong issue\n. Descriptive names and small functions are great, I would accept PRs that made those kinds of changes(and pretty much anything else from Code Complete or Clean Code). \nBut I'm sure there are people that are way more comfortable with just commenting than actually changing any code and I'd probably accept those PRs as well(& probably just clean it up myself).\nPlus, any class/function comments will be parsed into API Docs:\nhttps://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html\nSo this is ideal(but not expected):\n` javascript\n/*\"\"\"\n.. function:: size_of_last_box(size_of_box)\n    Calculate the number of eggs in the last box, assuming all\n    of the boxes have a maximum size ofsize_of_box``.\n:param size_of_box: The maximum size of a box.\n   :type size_of_box: Number\n   :returns: The number of eggs in the last box.\n   :rtype: Number\n*/\nfunction size_of_last_box(size_of_box) {\n  number_of_eggs = add_numbers(b,c) \n  return get_remainder(number_of_eggs, size_of_box) \n}\n```\n. Thanks!\n. I fixed it before checking for PRs >.< \nBut thanks :)\n. Thanks. In the future it'd be nice if links were added to the bottom(but not a big deal).\n. #713 Added the gitter badge. Should I add anything else?\n. Death to trailing whitespace!\nThanks :)\n. Merci beaucoup!\n. Thanks\n. If you're interested you could write it using Sphinx markup:\nhttp://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/index.html#writing-documentation\nlike this:\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/blob/develop/app/content/pencil/common/pencil.js#L53-L67\nand it'll show up in the api docs:\nhttp://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html\nIf not, let me know & I'll merge it.\n. So this actually brings up a good question: what should the section nesting in the docs look like?\nIf you check out the current Pencil namespace API: https://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html#pencil\nit kinda looks like this:\n* Class or Namespace\n      * attributes \n  * functions\nWith your current indention it'll look like this:\n* Class or Namespace\n      * attributes \n  * other functions\n* Pencil.setPainterCommandChecked\nwhere the new function is below the Namespace instead of nested within it. I think a flat structure(where we un-nest the attributes & other functions like you did) might be better since everything is nested under a section header of the class or namespace already & you won't have to worry about the proper indentation when writing docs, you can just align it with the /*\"\"\"\nComments? Otherwise I'll probably merge this & fix the others\n. Heyo, I had actually meant that I would probably migrate the other indentations to match yours - sorry for the confusion.\n. Sorry for the delay, I thought github would email me when PRs were opened...\n. Thanks :)\n. I've kept the maxVersion to a version someone's tested Pencil on because I'm kinda paranoid of a backwards incompatible change destroying saved data... Maybe that's too paranoid?\nDo PNG exports work in v17? I believe this change in FF36 broke them:\n\nThe nsIWebBrowserPersist.saveURI() method now requires 8 arguments, in an order incompatible with previous releases.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/36\n. FF36 made us make a change that breaks the app for every previous version of FF. If you try exporting a document as a PNG with a version before FF36 it will just hang. I think all export methods might've been broken by this. I think it's a good idea to keep it at 36.\nI'm running FF's dev release now so I'll at least keep the maxversion at that version number(currently 41), maybe bump it up to 200 or something.\nWindows builds have xulrunner packaged with them already.\nIf openSUSE's xulrunner is that old, I'd run a sed command when packaging that removes xulrunner from the BINARIES array in /bin/pencil(assuming opensuse's packaging system allows this) & then make the package depend on Firefox instead of xulrunner. That'll make sure it uses FF to launch instead of xulrunner.\n. Thanks :)\n. I changed it because the pencil2d animation software was installing under /usr/share/pencil on debian. I think they now use pencil2d instead so it should be OK to switch it back. See #499 instead.\n. Should be fine to fix it. Need to make sure to update the Arch Linux PKGBUILD if the folder name in -linux-pkg.tar.gz is modified. Will this require switching to /usr/share/pencil?\n. Thanks for packaging this :)\n. Thanks a lot! I'm about to go out of town for 2 weeks & I might not have time to review this before then.\n. Thanks, will release a new version with a .deb soon.\nThe sudo chown -R root ... line isn't necessary is it? It causes an error for me & everything seems fine with it removed.\n.

Bout to release a new version, will try to get this in.\n. This exists & should be supported in the github & mozilla XPI files in the next version.\nShould I add anything in the Readme with respect to Palemoon before closing this?\n. OK did more reading, looks like exporting won't work because of breaking changes mozilla make to FFv38. People have asked for me to support a lower version of FF/XRE before, I will investigate.\n. Exporting now works in Palemoon as of v2.0.21. You should also be able to install it from the firefox addons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n. Also issue #802 does not occur when using with Palemoon.\n. Thanks, been holding out hoping the old author would get back to me about taking over the extension already on the AMO but I'll probably cave now.\n. Awaiting validation:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\nIf mozilla truly deprecates XUL, pencil will die unless it is re-written using the WebExtensions API - provided the API can actually provide equivalent functionality of XUL...\n. Thanks for bumping this and reminding me :)\n. Reopening this because at the rate that mozilla is approving plugins, it will take a year and a half for Pencil to be reviewed & signed... We are number 144 in the queue and haven't moved since I uploaded 3 days ago...\nI think the solution will be to keep that in the review queue and also upload an unlisted XPI that can be distributed via the github releases page. Unlisted addons get signed immediately so that would allow installation once FF hits v44(where I believe the ability to install unsigned plugins will be removed).\n. Unlisted XPIs are uploaded to AMO, just not shown in their addons directory, and thus are immediately signed instead of having to wait for approval.\nBut thanks to Noitidart, the listed Pencil addon has been approved early and can be installed without disabled the signature requirements:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n. Thanks :)\n. Can you try installing this package and let me know if it works OK:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jypxqi5hzv1alq5/pencil-2.0.14-ubuntu-all-debian-fix.deb?dl=0\n.

Only lintian error now is our lack of a manpage.\n. Thanks for this, I'm away from my home base at the moment, but I'll try to get this in soon.\n. I've been holding off on this - been thinking we should ask the mailing list or more users about which they prefer...\nIf one of you would like to make a post to the pencil-users google group, go ahead - otherwise I will at some point.\nAlso, feedback from contributers would be appreciated:\n@nathanielw @jdittrich @mvdw @just-paja @horacimacias @joemirizio @Zyzle @ovruni\n. These are great. \nMaybe it's a pen because we are manipulating stencils, and pen + stencil = pencil ??\n. Thanks :)\n. @bmarkovic Are you always behind a proxy? If not, does OpenClipart not work for you all the time?\n. Moving is easy, coming up with fair decision-making, & membership processes are the hard parts.\n. Thanks for catching that @igpremuo \n. Oops, actually that only applies for debian builds. I'll move all linux builds to either pencil or pencil-prototyping before the next release...\n. #499 \n. Fixed in develop, new version soon.\n. Awesome, thanks for contributing :)\n. Did you have any previous versions of Pencil installed?\nIf so, could you try running off of my develop branch with the -purgecaches option just to make sure this wasn't caused by an older version?\nLike this:\nbash\n./build.sh mac\nOutputs/Mac/XUL.framework/Versions/Current/xulrunner Outputs/Mac/Pencil.app/Contents/Resources/application.ini -purgecaches\nIf you've tried the develop branch with no caches already let me know and I'll merge this.\n. Tested on linux as well, works great - thanks!\n. Hi, changing the max version should be fine. It's been done on the develop branch already.\nI'm not at home and my laptop's distro(NixOS) doesn't have everything to make a new release on the master branch - so it'll have to wait til the 29th or so, or I'll have to write a package for nsis.\n. AMO will automatically reject the plugin if the MaxVersion is too high. Went ahead & tested on FF Developer so should be good til v46 now.\n. (new release on the way)\n. for now you can disable extension signing by toggling xpinstall.signatures.required in about:config\nfirst priority for installs will be getting the unlisted XPI signed while we wait for the listed one to be reviewed. then I'll poke around debian installs. Might be a little while, on the road so I can't spin up a ubuntu VM to play around w/ it.\n. Awesome, I've been wanting this feature.\nI'll be traveling home all day tomorrow, then I gotta rebuild my desktop, I'll review it when I get everything all setup again.\n. Does the other pencil application store stuff in /usr/share/pencil? Is the binary named pencil? If so those will have to change as well, I will update the debian/ubuntu build script to deal with that in a couple of days and make a new release.\n. Haven't heard of anyone working on them. You might want to ask on the mailing list as well:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pencil-user\nIf you find or start this project, feel free to submit a PR adding the collection to the Readme.\n. Should be possible by just changing architecture in builds/Ubuntu/control to any or all. The initial PR had it set to amd64 & I didn't catch it, sorry about that.\nGrabbing Ubuntu i386 right now so I can test it out first.\n. Maybe try removing the ~/.pencil folder XULRunner sets up? You could also see if firefox --app /path/to/pencil/application.ini works.\n. You could also try xulrunner /path/to/application.ini --purgecaches.\n. XPI is the application as a firefox addon, EXE is the application as a native Windows program. I don't use Firefox Cloud or know how it works so I can't comment on that, but both versions should let you save to the current computer.\nI merged the PR by @mikedlr and added a link to Mozilla's Addon Repository as well.\nAlso,  there is Google Group from the old Evolus Pencil that you can use:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pencil-user\n. Should be fixed now.\n. Interesting, thanks for the report. Were no breaking changes in FF45 according to mozilla... Will investigate.\n. I'm pretty sure it's a bug in Firefox. There's nothing relevant in the release notes for FFv45.\nI made a bug: https://bugzil.la/1259385\n. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1259385#c13\nGonna have to go through the nightlies & figure out which one breaks Pencil.\n. I don't really have the time to figure this out, sorry guys. If you're getting this bug, I suggest moving on to http://github.com/evolus/pencil.\nI'll keep bumping maxVersion hoping it'll be fixed in the future but if you want to continue using v2 either use an older firefox, or use xulrunner/palemoon. I'm using this repo, mostly with xulrunner but also with palemoon.\n. Wow, this is great, thanks a lot :)\n. Thanks!\n. Accidentally left a debug flag on when building the latest versions, 2.0.18 incoming soon.\n. Can you test 2.0.18? \nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.18\n. Sorry, internet died in the middle of my upload & I didn't notice. Should be up there now.\n. That looks like Norton 360 Total Security, not a Windows pop-up. The files under the xulrunner directory are distributed by Mozilla. If you trust Mozilla, you should allow the installer to create those target files.\nAnother option is to install firefox then create a .bat file that runs firefox.exe -app C:/path/to/pencil/folder/application.ini.  Installing somewhere other than C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ might also prevent this.\n. Wow, didn't even know about Pencil v3. That's great because I have nowhere near the amount of free time it would take to get Pencil from XUL to Webextensions. My last ditch \"keep Pencil alive\" plan was going to be switching to supporting Pale Moon.\nI did try to contact them via Twitter & Email when I forked Pencil, & never got a response. Then I got an email from them saying they were going to bring it back & incorporate some of my changes - but I never heard back from them after that.\n. Got an email about this as well. I was able to open my .ep files from Pencil v2 but couldn't add new stencils to my document :/\nI'm going to see if D\u01b0\u01a1ng is willing to put up a project roadmap along with some issues so we can have some easy ways to hook into the new development.\nI think the future of this repo will be patching it to work with Pale Moon(even if they re-fork they said it will still support XUL) & releasing a linux version with a bundled xulrunner(like the windows & os x versions), just to make it last for people who can't switch to v3 for whatever reason.\n. There's a link to the new project in the readme, I will be keeping this project minimally-maintained for use w/ xulrunner/palemoon.. Thanks, might take me a couple days before I can look over it & test it out.\n. Thanks!\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Thanks again :)\n. Should be fixed.\n. Bumped this to 52 in the lastest release. . See #802\n. See #802\n. See #802\n. Awesome, thanks. I added a link to the icons in this repo's README.\nYou may want to let Evolus know as well, if they are compatible w/ v3(I don't know of any stencil differences between v2 & v3).. I added a link to v3 in the readme. I'll keep maintaining this but probably won't do much more development. I get the \"can't drag & drop\" bug in v3, so I'm still using this with xulrunner/palemoon.\n. Fixed\n. Should be fixed. I tried to keep it to versions I've tested but haven't had time to work on pencil for a while, especially since v3 exists now. If I have trouble keeping the maxVersion up to date, I'll just bump it up to 999 or something.\n. Should be fixed. You might want to check out the http://github.com/evolus/pencil repo as well.\n. Thanks.\n. For version 3, please open an issue with Evolus' repository: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. See #802\n. Yup, 3.0 issues should be reported to https://github.com/evolus/pencil. For version 3, please open an issue with Evolus' repository: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. Yeah this is a bug in newer FF versions & neither me nor mozilla have the time to figure out whats going on. I'll keep bumping maxVersion hoping it'll be fixed in the future but either use an older firefox, or use xulrunner/palemoon.\n. Did v49 fix the drag-and-drop issue?\n. Does 2.0.21 not work?. @giancarloandroid First release of this repository was v2.0.6. You should checkout the standalone version on this repo's Releases page, or http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3.. See #802 \nFor ubuntu standalone, you can try installing xulrunner\nLet me know if you are experiencing a different issue & I'll re-open. Either use Pale Moon, Xulrunner, an older version of Firefox, or Pencil v3.\nSee #802. That is Evolus' home page, not this projects. Our downloads are on this github projects \"Releases\" page. Alternatively, checkout the Pencil v3 project: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. I think this is fixed by modifying our deb to include xulrunner instead of depending on firefox. This hasn't been fixed. Don't know when I will have the time to fix it.\nSomeone else could start by taking a look at the ubuntu function in builds/build.sh. The fix would include xulrunner in the package and modify the pencil script to call that xulrunner instead of firefox/iceweasel, then remove firefox/iceweasel from the ubuntu dependencies.. Pencil v3 is released, will only be doing minimal maintenance to this repo, I'd make an issue in the v3 repo: http://github.com/evolus/pencil . See #856 #802 and http://github.com/evolus/pencil. See #856 . Wrong repo, see http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3.. Wrong repo, see http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3.. ",

I tested the compatibility: no problem.\nRests the question:\nIs this a good solution?\n. I have been investigating, since I can reproduce this problem.\nUsing the button from the native GUI widgets with a text: \"my button\", Pencil creates an .ep file with:\n<foreignObject ...>\n            <html:div ...>\n              <button style=\"...\" p:name=\"xulControl\" id=\"...\" label=\"my button\" .../>\n              ...\n            </html:div>\n    </foreignObject>\nbut I would expect something like this:\n<foreignObject ...>\n            <html:div ...>\n              <button style=\"...\" p:name=\"xulControl\" id=\"...\"  ...>my button</button>\n              ...\n            </html:div>\n    </foreignObject>\nThe HTML tag  does not support a label attribute according http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp.\nChanging the ep file to the latter, causes the text to appear on load (but editing it does not work good), which proves my point.\nSo, IMHO there is something wrong with the stencil, or the way it is interpreted.\n. Maybe we should disable the Native UI Stencil Collection until this problem is fixed?\n. Indeed, LibreOffice 4.3 gives an error: \n\nThe file 'testPencil.odt' is corrupt and therefore cannot be opened. LibreOffice can try to repair the file.\n\nWhen clicking the \"Yes\" button, the document opens correctly.\nI tried fixing the problem by adding a Configuration2 folder in the ODT template folder, but that alone does not solve the problem.\nHow can we see an error report from LibreOffice for the import? Nothing appears on the commandline...\n. BTW, why is the minVersion increased to 36.0? \nIn the original evolus version is was much lower...\nI have a system here with version 17.0.10 and it works perfectly with Pencil (after adapting the minVersion). So, I propose to lower the minVersion to something like 17.0.\n. I believe the version 17.0.10 was the xulrunner version.\nOn my laptop I have (openSuse 13.2 and) now updated xulrunner to the latest version: 31.8.0.\nThat means, that when I install the latest Pencil 2.0.12, I get the error:\nPlatform version 31.8.0 is not compatible with:\nminVersion >= 36.0\nmaxVersion <= 39.*\nThe simplest solution IMHO would be to lower the minVersion (to 31 or 17, at your wish).\n. Hmm, on second thought: There are multiple problems here:\n- if xulrunner is installed, then the max/minVersions apply to the xulrunner versions, if xulrunner is not installed, then the versions apply to firefox.\n- the moment that firefox chooses to update my system to firefox 40, my pencil install will cease to start at all. Then I have to wait until the package creator updates the pencil package, and then I have to install that. This is an impossible situation - we can not do this to our users. \n- if firefox 36 was the only version that broke Pencil, then we should have only that version be excluded. Maybe just show a warning to the user - but I would not advise to attempt that - to complicated.\n- I am working on updating the openSuse package from 2.05 to 2.012. It already works, but this version problem makes Pencil unusable when also xulrunner is installed. That is unacceptable.\nConclusion: quick and dirty fix please: reduce the minVersion. Ofcourse, I can include a patch in the rpm build...\n. I have been reading the XUL Application Packaging instructions at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL_Application_Packaging. It says: \nThe [Gecko] section\nThe Gecko section specifies what version of XULRunner is required by the application.\nMinVersion\n    Specifies the minimum XULRunner version needed by this application. If there are binary components, MinVersion must equal the version of the libxul SDK which is used to build the application.\n    REQUIRED\n    Example: MinVersion=1.8\nMaxVersion\n    Specify the maximum XULRunner version needed by this application.\n    OPTIONAL - default value is any XULRunner less than XULRunner 2\n    Example: MaxVersion=1.8.0.*\nMy conclusion: This system is broken.\nApparently, when running an application, the given values are compared to the firefox or xulrunner versions, NOT the Gecko version.\nThe following link is a book:\nhttps://books.google.be/books?isbn=1304608700\nThis book advises on page 11 to set the max version on 200., or package the right xulrunner with the app.\nI advise to do the former for Linux, and the latter for Windows.\n. I did use the sed command as described above. There is no problem any more on OpenSUSE.\nThis request may be closed now.\n. For now, you can use the xslt at pencil/app/content/pencil/exporter/Pencil2SVG.xslt to convert the .ep file to a *.svg file.\nI do this on Linux with xsltproc.\nHowever, this only works well if the .ep file contains only one page - since all pages are mixed in one SVG file.\n. I need to add more file changes - sorry I made a mess of this ... hang on.\n. OK - now it is complete.\nI have to learn to use git better...\n. ok. Done.\nClose.\n. To clarify my point:\nBefore the change:\n\nAfter the change:\n\nThere is already an other issue  (#177) for adding more different arrow types, and a choice between them, but that is a far more complicated matter.\n. If you look at the code of the table under\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/blob/develop/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\nand then everything under\n<Shape id=\"table\" displayName=\"Table\" icon=\"Icons/table.png\">\nup to the next\n</Shape>\nthen you will indeed see this limit: \nThere is a Property name=\"h0\" to \"h11\" defined.\nIMHO, increasing this to a few more properties should be simple.\nHow many do we need?\n. I agree with dropping the shadows and light.\nSwitching to a pencil instead of a pen is a good idea, but showing the full length of a pencil is an over-used icon.\nCan we stick to showing just the head of the pencil, pointing up like the old logo - so that it still resembles the old logo?\n(Search on Google images for \"pencil head close up\" to get an idea.)\n. @nathanielw: Great! That is what I had in mind. I like this one very much, but the geometry is not yet correct: the blank wood part should be a cone (round), not a pyramid. And no shadow please.\nIMHO it is enough to just show the pencil or pen as a tool, while not trying to express the action of writing or drawing. Hence, the tip of the pen should not be pointing down on paper, and may point up - which is the way you inspect a pen/pencil.\n. I think the OpenClipart issue is fixed. See #189 and #265.\n.

I tested the compatibility: no problem.\nRests the question:\nIs this a good solution?\n. I have been investigating, since I can reproduce this problem.\nUsing the button from the native GUI widgets with a text: \"my button\", Pencil creates an .ep file with:\n<foreignObject ...>\n            <html:div ...>\n              <button style=\"...\" p:name=\"xulControl\" id=\"...\" label=\"my button\" .../>\n              ...\n            </html:div>\n    </foreignObject>\nbut I would expect something like this:\n<foreignObject ...>\n            <html:div ...>\n              <button style=\"...\" p:name=\"xulControl\" id=\"...\"  ...>my button</button>\n              ...\n            </html:div>\n    </foreignObject>\nThe HTML tag  does not support a label attribute according http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp.\nChanging the ep file to the latter, causes the text to appear on load (but editing it does not work good), which proves my point.\nSo, IMHO there is something wrong with the stencil, or the way it is interpreted.\n. Maybe we should disable the Native UI Stencil Collection until this problem is fixed?\n. Indeed, LibreOffice 4.3 gives an error: \n\nThe file 'testPencil.odt' is corrupt and therefore cannot be opened. LibreOffice can try to repair the file.\n\nWhen clicking the \"Yes\" button, the document opens correctly.\nI tried fixing the problem by adding a Configuration2 folder in the ODT template folder, but that alone does not solve the problem.\nHow can we see an error report from LibreOffice for the import? Nothing appears on the commandline...\n. BTW, why is the minVersion increased to 36.0? \nIn the original evolus version is was much lower...\nI have a system here with version 17.0.10 and it works perfectly with Pencil (after adapting the minVersion). So, I propose to lower the minVersion to something like 17.0.\n. I believe the version 17.0.10 was the xulrunner version.\nOn my laptop I have (openSuse 13.2 and) now updated xulrunner to the latest version: 31.8.0.\nThat means, that when I install the latest Pencil 2.0.12, I get the error:\nPlatform version 31.8.0 is not compatible with:\nminVersion >= 36.0\nmaxVersion <= 39.*\nThe simplest solution IMHO would be to lower the minVersion (to 31 or 17, at your wish).\n. Hmm, on second thought: There are multiple problems here:\n- if xulrunner is installed, then the max/minVersions apply to the xulrunner versions, if xulrunner is not installed, then the versions apply to firefox.\n- the moment that firefox chooses to update my system to firefox 40, my pencil install will cease to start at all. Then I have to wait until the package creator updates the pencil package, and then I have to install that. This is an impossible situation - we can not do this to our users. \n- if firefox 36 was the only version that broke Pencil, then we should have only that version be excluded. Maybe just show a warning to the user - but I would not advise to attempt that - to complicated.\n- I am working on updating the openSuse package from 2.05 to 2.012. It already works, but this version problem makes Pencil unusable when also xulrunner is installed. That is unacceptable.\nConclusion: quick and dirty fix please: reduce the minVersion. Ofcourse, I can include a patch in the rpm build...\n. I have been reading the XUL Application Packaging instructions at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL_Application_Packaging. It says: \nThe [Gecko] section\nThe Gecko section specifies what version of XULRunner is required by the application.\nMinVersion\n    Specifies the minimum XULRunner version needed by this application. If there are binary components, MinVersion must equal the version of the libxul SDK which is used to build the application.\n    REQUIRED\n    Example: MinVersion=1.8\nMaxVersion\n    Specify the maximum XULRunner version needed by this application.\n    OPTIONAL - default value is any XULRunner less than XULRunner 2\n    Example: MaxVersion=1.8.0.*\nMy conclusion: This system is broken.\nApparently, when running an application, the given values are compared to the firefox or xulrunner versions, NOT the Gecko version.\nThe following link is a book:\nhttps://books.google.be/books?isbn=1304608700\nThis book advises on page 11 to set the max version on 200., or package the right xulrunner with the app.\nI advise to do the former for Linux, and the latter for Windows.\n. I did use the sed command as described above. There is no problem any more on OpenSUSE.\nThis request may be closed now.\n. For now, you can use the xslt at pencil/app/content/pencil/exporter/Pencil2SVG.xslt to convert the .ep file to a *.svg file.\nI do this on Linux with xsltproc.\nHowever, this only works well if the .ep file contains only one page - since all pages are mixed in one SVG file.\n. I need to add more file changes - sorry I made a mess of this ... hang on.\n. OK - now it is complete.\nI have to learn to use git better...\n. ok. Done.\nClose.\n. To clarify my point:\nBefore the change:\n\nAfter the change:\n\nThere is already an other issue  (#177) for adding more different arrow types, and a choice between them, but that is a far more complicated matter.\n. If you look at the code of the table under\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/blob/develop/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\nand then everything under\n<Shape id=\"table\" displayName=\"Table\" icon=\"Icons/table.png\">\nup to the next\n</Shape>\nthen you will indeed see this limit: \nThere is a Property name=\"h0\" to \"h11\" defined.\nIMHO, increasing this to a few more properties should be simple.\nHow many do we need?\n. I agree with dropping the shadows and light.\nSwitching to a pencil instead of a pen is a good idea, but showing the full length of a pencil is an over-used icon.\nCan we stick to showing just the head of the pencil, pointing up like the old logo - so that it still resembles the old logo?\n(Search on Google images for \"pencil head close up\" to get an idea.)\n. @nathanielw: Great! That is what I had in mind. I like this one very much, but the geometry is not yet correct: the blank wood part should be a cone (round), not a pyramid. And no shadow please.\nIMHO it is enough to just show the pencil or pen as a tool, while not trying to express the action of writing or drawing. Hence, the tip of the pen should not be pointing down on paper, and may point up - which is the way you inspect a pen/pencil.\n. I think the OpenClipart issue is fixed. See #189 and #265.\n. The web page at http://pencil.evolus.vn/Features.html contains the following message:\nCopyright \u00a9 2008-2012 Evolus. All rights reserved.\nSo, I do not think we are allowed to copy this, isn't it?\n. The correct name is not evoluspencil...\nEvolus is the company that abandoned this project.\nThe name \"pencil-prototyping\" was chosen for the firefox plugin, so I guess that is applicable here too.\n. I presume this issue is a duplicate of #742.\n. ",

    "mikedlr": "An additional note to this.  There are many cases where the resizing works, but wrongly.  E.g. the SVG drawing imports but is much bigger than the box which is shown for sizing it.\n. @prikhi suggest to close this bug unless someone comes up with instructions to reproduce.  I assume it's been fixed now.\n. @zindy are you able to put that as a pull request and link it to this issue please?\n. Hi @jackfunkinstain123 ; you need to read a bit down in the main README file,  there you can find the link to a ready to go windows installer.    I don't know of another support forum than this.  If you have time it might be nice to start one.  \nI have put in a pull request to make the link more obvious.  This should request should now be closed.\n. @prikhi (n.b. this is the same mikedlr - the other account is for automation) \nI think that even with this news it's worth going ahead with setting up a community support system for a version of pencil.  A number of reasons\n1. D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u00e0nh An is clearly not able to respond much.  Having a community which can look after users will always be valuable\n2. The current Pencil works now.  It would be useful to allow those that use it for work to migrate off slowly and in a controlled way to any new version\n3. If something goes wrong with the new version (e.g. it never becomes available) then it would be really useful to have a head start in maintaining the old one.  \nDo you agree?  Would you set up (or like me to set up) a public project?  If you don't have time to or don't want to do it yourself I'll do it (for you) and can give you the right to the repos.\n. @Ed-Fernando \nThe major worry is that xulrunner has been depreciated.\n- There's no guarantee how much longer it will be working and/or supported (though I guess Ubuntu 16's recent release including a version gives it a reasonably long lifetime??).\n- There's also no guarantee when the next version of pencil will come out.  It's been two years, and whilst there seems to be some progress there's certainly no deadline given\n- Palemoon is likely not to be completely safe since the also have to update to match firefox\n- Any migration to another platform might take a very long time. \nSo my proposal would be to\n- concentrate on stability / bug fixing\n- maintain both backwards and forwards file format compatibility (e.g. keep the file format stable)\n- hope to maintain the current runner interfaces for a year or more\nBut even so we shouldn't assume the new software will come out and save us.  That means start gently trying to port to some other javascript / HTML5 engine.  The question is, which?  \nI think it might be worth investigating ionic  as a target?

There's already an issue tracker at\nhttps://gitlab.com/evolus/pencil/issues\nWhat could probably be valuable would be going through old, still open issues and:\n- if the issue doesn't exist any more, make the note that it's fixed in the new version;\n- close it with won't fix here if we don't think it's realistic to backport the fix\n- if the issue still exists create a new issue in gitlab \n- add links in both directions between the issues\nthen, of course, start trying to fix the bugs, but aim first for fixing the new version.\n. Hi @nazarhussain ;  It \"works for me\".  I'm using 2.0.18.\n- what operating system are you using?\n- what exactly do you do? (step by step from starting)\n- what version of firefox/xulrunner do you have installed? (try with a newer one?)\n- do you get the problem even if you start with a fresh empty file?\nIf you get the problem with only one file, could you make a copy and experiment with deleting things from it till you get an almost empty file that still causes the problem.  If you find out exactly what causes the problem please say so.  If you can, please attach an example file which causes the problem.\n. An additional note to this.  There are many cases where the resizing works, but wrongly.  E.g. the SVG drawing imports but is much bigger than the box which is shown for sizing it.\n. @prikhi suggest to close this bug unless someone comes up with instructions to reproduce.  I assume it's been fixed now.\n. @zindy are you able to put that as a pull request and link it to this issue please?\n. Hi @jackfunkinstain123 ; you need to read a bit down in the main README file,  there you can find the link to a ready to go windows installer.    I don't know of another support forum than this.  If you have time it might be nice to start one.  \nI have put in a pull request to make the link more obvious.  This should request should now be closed.\n. @prikhi (n.b. this is the same mikedlr - the other account is for automation) \nI think that even with this news it's worth going ahead with setting up a community support system for a version of pencil.  A number of reasons\n1. D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u00e0nh An is clearly not able to respond much.  Having a community which can look after users will always be valuable\n2. The current Pencil works now.  It would be useful to allow those that use it for work to migrate off slowly and in a controlled way to any new version\n3. If something goes wrong with the new version (e.g. it never becomes available) then it would be really useful to have a head start in maintaining the old one.  \nDo you agree?  Would you set up (or like me to set up) a public project?  If you don't have time to or don't want to do it yourself I'll do it (for you) and can give you the right to the repos.\n. @Ed-Fernando \nThe major worry is that xulrunner has been depreciated.\n- There's no guarantee how much longer it will be working and/or supported (though I guess Ubuntu 16's recent release including a version gives it a reasonably long lifetime??).\n- There's also no guarantee when the next version of pencil will come out.  It's been two years, and whilst there seems to be some progress there's certainly no deadline given\n- Palemoon is likely not to be completely safe since the also have to update to match firefox\n- Any migration to another platform might take a very long time. \nSo my proposal would be to\n- concentrate on stability / bug fixing\n- maintain both backwards and forwards file format compatibility (e.g. keep the file format stable)\n- hope to maintain the current runner interfaces for a year or more\nBut even so we shouldn't assume the new software will come out and save us.  That means start gently trying to port to some other javascript / HTML5 engine.  The question is, which?  \nI think it might be worth investigating ionic  as a target?  That would hopefully mean that some of the work done would still be useful even if the new version came out soon.\n. This is great news.
