    "mhartington": "Hello! So Ionic-native is the successor to ngCordova for Ionic2. It's still in progress and we're currently adding docs. Keep and eye out soon! \n. This has been done. \n. We can do that. It was my understanding that at some point down the road, we'd thrown an error telling the user if the plugin wasn't included and provide the necessary data on how to add it. \nIf thats some ways off, for sure, we can ditch the extra info and just hardcode stuff in dgeni comments\n. Hmm, it shouldn't be doing that. \njavascript\n/**\n * @private\n */\nstatic methodName(){}\nAll this does is tells dgeni, the docs parser to not generate documentation for this method. It shouldn't actually change the method.\n. Which IDE? Let me test it out.\n. Yes I saw the sample, but it just doesn't seem necessary. \nThe current implementation requires an extra class import, but you don't need it.\n. Yes, @keithdmoore you have made that clear already here.\nAs stated, it's one less step, and isn't required to make the plugin actually work. No need for code that doesn't actually do anything other than return strings. \n. Push support for ionic 2 is still a work in progress. \nhttp://blog.ionic.io/ionic-platform-update/\n. I personally don't see the benefit. While it may not be consistent, I think it does provide a clear separation between methods that return once and methods/events that get fired multiple times.\nPerfect example, the bluetooth plugin.scan is a perfect use case for an observable because it gets called multiple times and returns different values each time.\nBut something like the camera plugin doesn't fit this. You call getPicture, take a photo, and return the data from that single instance. You're not returning multiple photos, just a single one. In this case, getPicture().then seems more a better fit.\n. @ihadeed sounds like a plan! I'll keep a look out during the doc clean up. \n. Since this is for ionic-native, web-sql is not the intended use case.  Instead, using the ionic SqlStorage class instead is a better option\nhttp://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/platform/storage/SqlStorage/\nIt will auto check if you have the sqlite plugin installed and use that, and if not, it will use websql, so it will work in the environments you need. \n. > Then we can get it merged back to master on this repo.\nI doesn't seem that there's much consensus on what plugin is the \"working\" one. \nWill test out each on and confirm.\n. Hey there, can you provide a demo or some git repo that has the issue. A simple blank app starter page will do.\n. @bokgeek did you update the installed package of ionic-native? Check your package.json, please make sure you have the most recent version. \n. @lehrenberg it should be possible to just add the 2 additional method to the class. If you're up for sending a Pull Request to add them, I'd be more than happy to walk you through it and merge it!. thanks for letting us know. We'll be looking into.\nPlease refrain from adding \"same here\" \n. @dlemphers  is this an ionic 1 project or ionic 2? Also, what's your installed typescript version?\ntsc -v\n. Danke \n. This should be fixed in the most recent version of the plugin\nIt had an outdated promise polyfil.\nCan you test and let me know?. Hm, yeah sounds like it might need to be added as an alternative option. \nThen at 4.0.0, we could remove the older plugin. \n@ihadeed thoughts? . Closing.. Hmm, just tested this out and all is working fine on 4.4.\nOn 6x, it's a bit different, but still working.\nWas able to replicate the same results using ionic and ionic-native, as well as cordova and raw API. Chances are, there's probably an issue with the plugin and should be brought the plugin repos attention.. duplicate of https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/895. Was this running on a device or via ionic-serve?. Something to consider are plugins who's API is a 1:1 match for the web API.\nGeolocation being one of them, but things like the new media stream plugin\nhttps://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-media-stream\nThere's a big push in the plugins to make them follow the spec, I think we should first audit which core plugins follow the web standard and take them into consideration.. So the code you'd write would be a match for the web API.\nFor example the image capture plugin\nhttps://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-image-capture\nnavigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({\n            'audio': true,\n            'video': {\n                facingMode: 'user'\n            }\n        }).then(function(getmedia) {\n            var track = getmedia.getVideoTracks()[0];\n            var imageCapture = new ImageCapture(track);\n        });\nThis code matches the actual browser implementation.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream\nSo even without cordova, the API will still work, because it's just standard JS. Hi there! This doesn't appear to be an issue with the ionic-native it self, so I'm going to close it. Please post your question on the Ionic Forum instead.. Anyone able to provide a sample of this? Im not able to recreate this in my tests. @mqasem92 and @UvealSnow can you both confirm if you have the privacy note added? \nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera#ios-quirks.

    "tlancina": "Thanks for the PR!\n. Hey @ihadeed, thanks for reaching out! We are definitely accepting contributions, but will need to discuss how we evaluate new plugins to add to Ionic Native.  I think if you're looking to contribute, probably the easiest way to do so right now would be to take a look at adding interfaces for any of the core Cordova plugins that are missing.\nIonic Native should be going up on the v2 docs with the first batch of plugins this week, and after that we will continue to add more.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about the project or need help with anything.\n. Yep, the goal for the moment is to just be a wrapper, with no plugin specific logic. A simple example is BarcodeScanner.\nStatusBar has not been updated yet, but should be by the end of the week.  Plugins that still have work to be done are: File, Push, StatusBar, Toast and TouchID.  These are somewhat arbitrary and are just the plugins that were added when the project was started.  We will be fleshing things out to add the Cordova core plugins and many of the plugins from ngCordova over the coming weeks.\n. PR looks great, thanks! I left a few comments on the diff.  If you want to add the descriptions of the options that would be awesome, but I can also do it after merge.\nI'm actually pretty unfamiliar with commitizen still (I still type the commit messages out by hand) so I'm not sure.  What shell are you using?\n. Hey @ihadeed apologies that I haven't gotten your PRs merged in yet. They're looking good, but I'd like to test the plugins to make sure everything is working as expected.  If they haven't gotten in by next week please ping me. \nNot sure about the commitizen thing, maybe @jimthedev can chime in quickly on whether there are any windows related commitizen quirks.\n. Ah derp, didn't realize it was configured on our end. Thanks! \n@ihadeed try pulling latest and running npm install, and let me know if you still have issues.\nThere's no conventional changelog yet, but I'll add it before the next release.\n. Done in https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/5f73bde4023c9a31f8e97d9ea4c8fc37fa3ec9a5.\n. Yeah would definitely love a PR. Check out https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md and https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/tree/master/src/plugins for some examples, and let me know if you have any questions/issues/feedback, thanks!\n. Yeah I'm not sure about this, we have the same issue with the Contacts plugin to some extent as well.  We could add it and just expose the properties of the plugin: https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/blob/master/www/googlemaps-cdv-plugin.js#L2537-L2584, but I can't think of a good way for us to wrap the callbacks on the instantiated Map object.\n. Thanks for the PR! Going to close this, and soon the Ionic Framework docs will have more in depth instructions on using native.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. @beachygreg PR's welcome! Take a look at the developer guide and https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/tree/master/src/plugins for some examples, and let me know if you have any questions/issues/feedback!\n. Oop looks like there was a bad release, can you try 1.0.11?\n. Yeah thanks for the heads up! Going to close now, but let us know if you're having any more issues.\n. Yeah I like this approach, looks fine to me :+1: \n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Do we need repo URL? I'm not sure what it was originally for, I think it\ncould probably safely removed and just documented.\nOn Tue, Mar 8, 2016 at 10:59 AM Ibrahim Hadeed notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI'll update what's missing and submit a PR.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/33#issuecomment-193867481\n.\n. Ah yeah, for now it shows the plugin id and command to install it: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/c48a851d877f1ca6a8252e2af36e00f9717993f4.\n\nGoing to close, since I think for now it's good, but we can revisit this if there is a case where more info is needed for plugins.\n. Thanks for the issue, looks like it might be a bug. The @Cordova decorator should have callbackOrder: 'reverse'.\n. I think this a great idea, we can definitely export everything in plugin.ts.\nOn Wed, Mar 9, 2016 at 3:04 PM Tom Sundstrom notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI like your @Plugin https://github.com/Plugin and @Cordova\nhttps://github.com/Cordova decorators!\nWould it make sense to let them be importable into another project?\nUse-case: niche Cordova-plugins built with Cordova-style callbacks, where\nit wouldn\u2019t make sense to bundle the pluginwrapper in ionic-native due to\nthem being obscure, private, app-specific, not-generally-useful, whatever,\nbut where ionic-native\u2019s conventions would still make a lot of sense.\nThis was actually possible and quite seamless:\nimport {Plugin, Cordova} from 'ionic-native/src/plugins/plugin\u2019;\n...assuming:\nnpm install --save\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native.git#1334f60b681fa5440174ca984d5a3a8b2d2814e6\nNo longer works as of this commit from a few days ago though: 2330670\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/2330670661c06078d0fb941812628f05c3ec2b92\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/37.\n. Should be able to import things like Cordova and Plugin from 'ionic-native' in the next release.\n. Yeah I think if possible we should try and have the wrapper be as small as possible, and use interfaces for the option objects as well:\n\n```\n  /*\n   * Show the ActionSheet.\n   /\n@Cordova()\n  static show(options?: ActionSheetOptions) : Promise { return }\n/*\n   * Hide the ActionSheet.\n   /\n  @Cordova()\n  static hide() : Promise { return }\n```\nI also am not a huge fan of having the interfaces cluttering up the top of the files, it would be nice to have just the description of the wrapper, with the very concise method definitions.  I can't remember if there is a good way to move them into their own files, while still using declaration: true. I want to say we have to concatenate them manually as part of the build.\nRegarding the promises, I agree, if possible they should all have the correct type.\n. Looking good to me :+1:\nI wonder if there is a way to include the plugin scripts automatically from their npm package somehow, instead of needing to mock them.\n. Yes, this should be Cordova. Looks good to me :+1: \n. Sounds great! What if we add this information to the @Plugin and @Cordova decorators and then possibly do runtime platform checks, since I believe Dgeni can also pull doc information out of the decorators.\n. I think this is great, unsubscribing removes the event listener :+1: \n. Already done in https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/92936896498d400a39ff2e9a9907b788a1192068!\n. Updated, thanks! @ihadeed let me know if anything breaks :)\n. Nice! I'd maybe remove the console logs and have CordovaInstance call wrapInstance directly so you can get rid of options.instanceMethod, but other than that looks good.  We have nothing for this right now, so might as well get it in and test it out and see what the issues are.\n. Hey @panuganti sorry you're having problems.  The reason the code that is distributed is so different from the source code is because it's being transpiled from TypeScript to ES5.  You can read more about some of the technologies involved here: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/resources/what-is/#typescript, as well as on the Ionic Forums: https://forum.ionicframework.com/. I believe Mike also added an #ionic-native channel to the Ionic Worldwide Slack group today.\nGoing to close this as I don't think there's any more actionable feedback for us, but let us know if you're still having issues, thanks!\n. It looks like the plugin defines only the vibrate function on window.navigator, @ihadeed are there any other plugins like this? I can't think of an easy way to fix this off the top of my head other than setting the pluginRef to just navigator, which seems weird.\n. Hey thanks for the issue.  Unfortunately encode crashes on Android due to a bug, so I didn't add it, but I guess we could and just document that it doesn't work on Android.\nMore info:\nhttps://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner/issues/174\n. Just published a new release, let us know if you have issues, thanks!\n. We should document this and maybe also add a watch task.\n@kdenz after building ionic-native locally, run npm link from the ionic-native project root to create a global symlink to your local version, then from your app's directory run npm link ionic-native to replace the one in node_modules that you got from npm with the global symlink.\nSteps:\n- cd ionic-native && npm install\n- npm run build_bundle\n- npm link\n  \u00a0\n- cd myapp\n- npm link ionic-native \nThen any imports like import {Camera} from 'ionic-native' will use the symlinked version that points to your local ionic-native.\n. Addresses https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/135\n. LGTM \ud83d\udc4d  \ncc @ihadeed \n. Hey sorry gang, just saw this and I'm about to head out for the weekend. Talking to @ihadeed I think we can use the existing eventObservable option of the @Cordova decorator and then you would subscribe to those events instead.\n. I believe plugin is 'cordova-plugin-datepicker' and pluginRef is 'plugins.datePicker'\n. Needs the @Cordova() decorator\n. ",
    "ihadeed": "Thanks @tlancina for your response.\n1. So if I understood correctly you are looking to create the interfaces only for now without any functionality? \n   I will follow the way you have the files in this directory are written: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins\n2. I was looking at https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/statusbar.ts#L67 and I noticed that lines 67-70 are referring to properties of StatusBar that are not defined. I understand those properties exist in the actual plugin but wouldn't it throw TypeScript/JavaScript errors unless it's ran on a device/emulator? Shouldn't we define/declare an alias for those properties?\n. Ok thanks for clearing things up.\nJust submitted a PR .. let me know if I should tweak anything..\n\nOff-topic question: I instealled commitizen but when I run git cz it only shows me a text editor similar to vi instead of options to pick from like the screenshot here .

This is an interesting plugin ...\nI just checked it out, and I was looking at this: https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/wiki/Map\nSeems like the plugin doesn't rely on static functions, but relies on class functions instead. My understanding is that the Ionic Native is written to call the plugin's static functions only. \nAny thoughts @tlancina ?\n.

(Not tested yet)\nIt should be included in the next release.\n. @phavre new version is available on NPM now. The globalization plugin is included in that release.\n. Hey @Artfloriani ,\nAs of now, you have to add the plugins using the CLI manually in order to successfully call their Ionic Native methods. \nAssuming you've installed the ionic-native npm package, follow these three steps to use any plugin:\n1. Install the plugin using CLI\nEvery plugin has the install command at the top of their docs page. Some might not be available as of now in the docs since they haven't been updated yet, but you can find most recent changes on the staging site here: http://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com/docs/v2/native/Flashlight/\nSo for example we will be working with the Flashlight plugin. Run this commnd to install the plugin first:\nshell\ncordova plugin add cordova-plugin-flashlight\n2. Import the plugin from ionic-native\njs\nimport {Flashlight} from 'ionic-native'\n3. Call the method you need\njs\nFlashlight.toggle();\nHope that helped.\n. @Artfloriani from my experience the GeoLocation plugin doesn't work on all Android devices without installing the plugin. Works on the browser fine. Not sure about iOS.\nLocal notification and image picker haven't been tested yet.\nI'm glad you found solutions to your problems.\n. Thanks @EddyVerbruggen !\n. Added and will be available in next release.\n. Yes. This plugin will be added soon: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file-transfer\n. The plugin is added and is available in the current NPM package and Github release. Sorry I forgot to close this earlier!\n. The code you have looks right to me ..\nDo you have the plugin cordova-plugin-file installed?\n. Hey @Fenkiou ..\nI was looking at the plugin's source code. The function getFreeDiskSpace() is not exposed in the plugin's JavaScript file. It is a function defined in the Java and Objective-C files only. Which explains why you aren't able to access it through the ionic-native wrapper you wrote.\nRef: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=getFreeDiskSpace\nThe ionic-native wrappers route your call to the plugin's methods that are defined in their JavaScript files (which is usually the methods they have documented).\nYou probably saw the method implemented in ngCordova and thought it's one of the plugin's methods. If you look at their code, they are actually executing the method using cordova.exec() which speaks to the Java/Object-C files directly without passing by the JS file.\nRef: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/file.js#L27-L35\nWe might be looking to implement a similar approach to that method when we add the file plugin. \n. Adding the @Cordova() decorator overrides anything that's defined in your function.\n. This should work.\n``` js\nstatic checkDir(path: string, dir: string):Promise {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    var directory = path + dir;\nif ((/^\\//.test(dir))) {\n    reject('directory cannot start with \\/');\n  }\ntry {\n    var directory = path + dir;\nwindow.resolveLocalFileSystemURL(directory, function (fileSystem) {\n  if (fileSystem.isDirectory === true) {\n    resolve(fileSystem);\n  } else {\n    reject({code: 13, message: 'input is not a directory'});\n  }\n}, function (error) {\n  error.message = error.code;\n  reject(error);\n});\n\n} catch (err) {\n    err.message = err.code;\n    reject(err);\n  }\n});\n}\n```\n. @Fenkiou Thanks for feedback. Glad you got it working.\n. I don't see any minified JS in the package. I'm afraid you would have to minify it yourself for now.\n. @deepslux are you using Ionic 2?\nIf so, you do not need to import any JS files to your index.html. You also wouldn't need to minify anything.\nImporting the plugin you need in your TypeScript files (import {Camera} from 'ionic-native';) will result in the needed code to be compiled in your app bundle JS file.\n. @deepslux I haven't tested it personally. But looking at the code it looks like the Angular 1 usage would be by importing the ngCordova module in your main app module. Then calling methods like ngCordova.Camera.getPicture().then(....\nThe methods are also exposed in the variable window.IonicNative.\nI wrote a little article explaining the various way of using Ionic Native, but again I haven't really tested it. Hence, why I haven't officially published the article. But you can have a look here: http://jsdev.ca/ionic-native-cordova-plugins-simplified/\n. Thanks @dzonatan , just needed to test it first.\n. @dzonatan it works great! Thanks.\nI just noticed it crashes if I call the method .close() then .show() ... The rest works fine.\nIt could be an issue with the plugin/device.\n. Solved by https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/90\nWill be available in next release.\n. I will merge once I test it.\n. @Fenkiou I just looked at this. Great work. \nDid you manage to test the functionality? \n. Thanks @Fenkiou \n. https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/70\n. Thanks!\n. Hey @royipressburger ,\nI checked out the plugin just now, and it seems like there aren't any methods to wrap with Ionic Native.\nInstalling and using the plugin could be done through the command line without the need to write any code. Simply run the following command:\nshell\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-customurlscheme --variable URL_SCHEME=mycoolapp\nMake sure to replace mycoolapp with the URL Scheme you desire. \n. Not sure what you mean @mlynch \n. @mlynch  I did some modifications in the dgeni template to display the platforms parameter for methods only. The comments displayed in the image are for an interface.. they are not being parsed or displayed in docs, just there for reference.\n. I had no luck finding any dgeni tutorials/docs... \n. @mlynch do you guys already have code for this in the ionic framework repo? or should I write it from scratch?\n. Just had a look at https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/scripts/docs/typescript-package/processors/readTypeScriptModules.spec.js#L69-L132\nSeems like the processor can already read interfaces. It just needs to be rendered in the template. \n. @ramonornela seems like the typescript-package folder contains processors that can parse interfaces, but I don't see them being imported anywhere in the process of doc generation. \nI will look into it more tonight and see how this could be done.\n. @ramonornela yeah I saw that page in the framework's docs. They're typing the docs manually for the interfaces. But the interfaces are written in a different file, maybe that's why. \nIn our case it should be easier to automatically document them since everything is one page. \n. Yeah you're right they're registered in dgeni-config .. https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/scripts/docs/dgeni-config.js#L4\n\nI just looked into the code and figured out how (almost) everything works. Looks like dgeni opens up index.ts as a module and parses it's exports. It doesn't care if there are multiple classes/interfaces in a file, they still get separate files generated. \nI think this current method wouldn't work out for ionic-native since we have lots of classes that are linked together and it wouldn't make sense to have separate pages. For example, the Google Maps plugin has many classes and interfaces exported, ideally we need all of them to be documented in the same page. \nI suggest changing the doc generation process for ionic native and make it loop through all the .ts files and treating each file as a module instead. Alternatively, we could \"import\" the docs we need semi-manually. That can work by creating a function (macro) that fetches the doc we need by name (it can get it from doc.moduleDoc.exports[<NAME HERE>] ). The second option is probably easier to achieve. \n. Requested here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/65\n. Is the plugin still functional? or it doesn't work at all?\nI followed the GitHub docs while writing this plugin's wrapper, so it should work fine. I didn't notice that console warning before.\nAfter reading the source code of the plugin, it seems like the developer has written an updated \"API\". It would take some time for us to implement the new API's as they do not have the successCallback and errorCallback in the main functions parameters anymore. They are expected inside the options parameter object.\nWe probably will end up doing minor modifications to Ionic Native to be compatible with the plugin's latest API.\n. @petkoe could you provide the code you're using?\n. @petkoe I just did some quick debugging. The issue occurs when you don't supply the second optional parameter start. \nFor now, you can pass null as the second parameter. This issue will be resolved in the next release.\njs\n    LaunchNavigator.navigate( ziel , null );\n. Thanks Peter @petkoe \n. Since the plugin uses instance methods, it will be added once we solve this issue here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/86\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/74\n. Thanks for the PR @keithdmoore \n1. No need to import the Connection interface into index.ts\n2. The plugin hasn't been added yet. I'm working on it in the add-network-info branch here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/add-network-info/src/plugins/networkinformation.ts\n. Never mind my previous comment. Just saw your recent commit @keithdmoore \n. @keithdmoore \nShouldn't static get connection() be static get type() to match the original plugin?\n. @keithdmoore Yeah onOnline does sound weird. \nThe reason I said change it to type because AFAIK the @CordovaProperty overrides the return value you have there by using the property name. \nReference: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/plugin.ts#L240-L259\n. @keithdmoore Ahh. type could be a reserved word.\nIf the code you wrote works then I think that's fine. I just thought the @CordovaProperty would overwrite it. I guess it's just there to check if the plugin and Cordova exist.\n. @keithdmoore this one https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/ed14d877226f38ed0742d1ed36d9f81de6ab0e04 ?\n. @keithdmoore @mlynch your input is appreciated here https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/86 \n.

What I really meant by \"Ionic Native is still in Beta\" is that it's an incomplete project at the moment. Not all major plugins (which are available in ngCordova) have been fully added, documented and/or tested.\n\nYou most likely won't have any major issues while using the package downloaded from NPM.\n. @ddennis you can acquire those files by cloning the repo.\n. Hey there,\nWe (developers and contributors) are constantly adding more typings and they should be all available at some point. Thanks for your patience.\n. It's a good idea to wait for the deviceready event by default since many plugins rely on it.\n. Just pushed a new branch that addresses this feature request. \nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/compare/feat/ondeviceready?expand=1\nThe way it works is that if we are calling an async function (the ones that return Promise or Observable), we will wait for ondeviceready to fire before we go ahead and make the call.\nI haven't tested it but in theory it should work. \nIf the developer is trying to access a sync function or a property, they will have to wrap it with an event listener manually in order to get it to work.\nCC: @mlynch @tlancina @mhartington \n. @mlynch \nI just read this in the Cordova Docs: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/cordova/events/events.html#deviceready\n\nThe deviceready event behaves somewhat differently from others. Any event handler registered after the deviceready event fires has its callback function called immediately.\n. @mlynch I'll leave it up to you to add this feature (merge PR) or leave it out.\n. hey @vfdev-5 \n\nI see you added the interfaces for now. Next step would be to add wrappers for the functions, then add the plugin to index.ts.\nOnce you're done with that run npm run build_bundle to compile the library and have something that you can import in a Cordova project and test.\n. @vfdev-5 yes if the functionality works submit a PR and I'll review & merge.\n. Thanks for the PR @drachenbach \n. Hey @panuganti ,\nI'm sorry that you are having a hard time following up with the current version of the documentation. I understand the frustration you are going through. \nThe developers and contributors of Ionic Native are constantly working on improving the documentation. There will certainly be a more thorough documentation available in the near future.\nHere's a quick-fix, you are able to see the latest version of the docs by going to the Ionic Framework Staging site. Be aware, that some plugins that are documented there are still not available in the stable version provided via the NPM package. Double check that you have the plugin definition available before trying to use it.\nhttp://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com/docs/v2/native/\n. Can you please provide me with a way to reproduce this issue? as well as the setup you are using (Platform, Framework .. etc)\n. @Lindstrom1989 What version of Angular 2 are you using?\n. Upgrade to beta.7 or later and that should solve the problem. \n. @tlancina I see the problem now. The plugin ref is incorrect. I think this is the only plugin that works this way. \n. @Lindstrom1989 Could you try again now with the latest release?\n@zhouhao27 the styling has been added in the latest release.\n. @bairathirahul @liangminhua please open a new issue with steps to reproduce.. Hey sorry I missed this earlier.\nFeel free to do anything as long as it matches this repo's style. There is no need to stick to ngCordova's conventions!\n. Thanks @nickgal \n. @cmanou yeah this plugin seems a bit tricky. \nWe can wrap the whole function without the @Cordova wrapper, something like this:\njs\nstatic isAvailable (app? : string) : Promise<boolean> {\nreturn new Promise<boolean>((res, rej) => {\ncordova.plugins.email.isAvailable(app, (isAvailable : boolean) => { if(isAvailable) res(); else rej() });\n});\n}\n.

Thanks @hackfrag \n. ionic-native package is Ionic Native, which is a set of wrappers that makes it using Cordova plugins more convenient in any application (doesn't have to necessarily be based on Ionic or TypeScript)\nand AFAIK ionic-framework is the old package name for the Ionic Framework. The new package that includes Ionic 2 and Angular 2 is referred to as ionic-angular\n. Ensure that ionic-angular package is present in your node_modules directory. If it is not there, run the following command in your project root directory npm install\nIf that wasn't the issue, please provide me with the steps you took to create the Ionic 2 project. \nUsually you would need to update your ionic CLI To latest Beta version by running npm install -g ionic@beta, then run the following command to create a new project: ionic start MyAppName --v2 --ts\n. The function openPage() is defined in MyApp component. Meaning that only app.html can access that method. Your tabs must be located in that html template and they should be calling the openPage() function. \nIf you are still having trouble please provide me with a compressed version of the app folder so I can have a look at it.\n. @JosephMendez Sorry I can't seem to find any problem with the code. \nI would advice you to update your CLI and recreate the project with the command above.\nIf you experience any more issues please report it on the forums and you should be able to resolve your issue shortly. \nhttps://forum.ionicframework.com/\n. This https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/e10d744e7ba82b287ff25acd663b02bc6b796005 can possibly fix it?\n. Seems like the TypeScript compiler isn't throwing that error anymore. \n. Thanks for the PR @Rybbow !\n. Hey @ct14it @jgw96 \nLooking at the image provided, it looks like not the whole screen is blurred out, which makes me doubt that the issue can be caused by a native plugin. This is most likely an issue with Ionic Framework or Cordova.\nI will follow the steps to reproduce when I get a chance and see if I can verify my observation or figure out the cause of this issue.\nThank you for your patience.\n. Unable to reproduce this issue.\n. Hey @wli \nThe issue should be resolved in the next release (will be published soon). Please let us know of the results once you get to test it.\n. Not sure what npm test command you're talking about @srishiva89 \n. Anything that you see on ngCordova site/repo does not relate to Ionic Native. They are two separate packages.\nWe can still add this plugin to Ionic Native though :)\n. Interesting plugin!\nWill add soon.\n. @panuganti \nTo answer your questions:\n- You must fork the repository, then pull your fork into your local machine. Follow this guide for more information on forking repos: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\n- I haven't used the demo personally and I don't think it has been updated. You can create a blank Cordova/Ionic app and test ionic-native there.\n\nAs for the code you have written, it looks good to me and that should work. Just a few notes:\n- Why is there a default value for the quality params?\n- No need to import CordovaProperty since we aren't wrapping any properties\n- No need to declare var window; since we aren't calling window in this plugin\nOther than that it looks good! Send a PR once you've figured out the Github issues and I will merge it.\nI hope that helped and let me know if you have any other questions.\n. Installing via NPM would get you the NPM package, not what you see here on Github. The master branch here is more like a development branch (for now). \nTo build it yourself, clone the repo, run npm install to install any development dependencies and then run the command npm run build_bundle to compile the library. Then you will see the files in the dist directory.\nI hope that helped, let me know if you have any further questions.\n. Not sure what the most efficient way is. But this is what I do:\nI have a blank Ionic 2 app in another directory. Both the app and ionic-native are located in the same parent directory. The Ionic app imports ionic-native from ../ionic-native/dist/index. Then I follow these steps every time I want to test something out:\n1. Run npm run build_bundle to build my new library (I can really skip this an import ../ionic-native/src/ but I do this to catch any build errors)\n2. Install any needed plugins to the Ionic app\n3. Run the Ionic app on my Android device\n4. Use Chrome remote debugging (chrome://inspect) to control the app through the console\nWhen I'm in the console, I just call the apps using IonicNative global variable. Example: IonicNative.Camera.getPicture(...).then(...)\n\nDo let me know if you think of a more efficient way!\n. If you are on Ionic 1 you can import ngCordova as an Angular 1 module and use it in your app. Alternatively, you may also call the plugins through window.IonicNative. Example: IonicNative.Toast.show(...);\nI hope that helped.\n. If you import the ionic native bundle JS file into your index.html you will\nbe able to access the plugins via IonicNative variable or ngCordova module.\nI haven't tested the ngCordova module method personally, but from the look\nof the code in index.ts it should work!\nngCordova and ionic native are separate, you are right. But the angular 1\nmodule for Ionic native  is being exported as ngCordova.

(Example Media plugin)\nJust a few concerns from the top of my head:\n- What if I would like to create multiple instances of Media plugin?\n- What if I need to get the URL for the file first, then instantiate the media plugin? (constructor requires media URL)\n- GoogleMaps SDK plugin needs an HTML container to be rendered in the DOM before we go ahead and create an instance of the plugin.\nSo overall, I think it's a good approach for static plugins but it's going to have conflicts with instance based ones. \n. After upgrading my apps to latest version of Ionic Framework 2, I noticed the changes to the way we display: Alert, ActionSheet, Loading, and Modal. We do not call a static function anymore to create an instance of the object, instead we inject the appropriate controller into our component and we create the object we need from there.\nThat process reminded me of this issue and I think we can apply the same concept here (works for instance based plugins too). Not sure how that would work out for Ionic 1 and non-Ionic users though. It seems like we would have to create a secondary wrapper that is explicitly for use with Angular 2 applications. Perhaps, we can automate it like @mlynch did over here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/ng1.ts\nThis post here can be inspiring: http://blog.lacolaco.net/post/dynamic-component-creation-in-angular-2/\n. Maybe it should be number|string instead?\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but if you pass the second parameter to the function and set type: 'currency' you will get a string back, not a number. \n. thanks @rapropos \n. Hey @Artfloriani thanks for opening the issue.\nCan you provide the code you are using to add multiple notifications?\nI tested it recently using the code here and it worked fine...\n. No problem. Glad you got it to work @Artfloriani \n. Hey @Langstra \nThanks for pointing out these issues. I applied some changes and will go ahead and test them now.\nThe Email type can be imported by using the following line:\nimport {Email} from 'ionic-native/dist/plugins/emailcomposer';\nNote that after the recent changes are published, you have to import it from ionic-native/dist/plugins/types/email\n. @Langstra I just tested the plugin on my Android Lolipop device.\nThe wrappers are working correctly now. However, the plugin itself isn't functioning properly (at least on my device?)\n. @Langstra  I'm going to open an issue with the developer and see if they can alter the implementation and fix the issues there.\n. Thanks for pointing out the issue @Langstra \n. Would you say this is related to your previous issue #164 ? \n. Ok I will look into this in a bit once I'm done fixing EmailComposer plugin. Thinking to set rxjs as a peerDependency instead of a dependency. This way it will just use whatever you have there from ionic-angular dependencies\n. I got that map error while using other observables, even outside of ionic-native. I think it's happening after a recent Angular update. My apps seem to work fine even with that runtime error.\nAs for the email error, I just fixed it now. \n. The issue should be fixed in next release (or clone & build master)\n. Did you try to watch the position using the plugin API instead of ionic-native wrapper?\n. I asked just because I can't see how the ionic-native wrapper can cause this issue. Thought it might be a bug with the plugin itself.\n. Hey there\nI just did some tests and found out that this is caused by the Geolocation API itself, and not by Ionic-native.\nWatching position when GPS is off doesn't send anything (unless if there is a recent position stored in the phones memory).\nI wonder if there is a way to prompt the user to turn the GPS on if watchPosition is unable to get location.\n. I suggest you open an issue with Apache.\n. Thanks @origin1tech \n. Hey @kentr \nYou can use ionic-native with any Cordova application.\nTo use it in Ionic 1 follow these steps:\n- Copy ionic.native.min.js to your www directory (you can copy the non-minified version if you wish)\n- Add that bundle file to your index.html (See https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic1-ionic-native-example/blob/master/www/index.html#L21-L22)\n- Use the plugins and their functions through the global variable IonicNative (See https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic1-ionic-native-example/blob/master/www/js/app.js#L28-L34)\nBest of luck!\n. - Are you waiting for ondeviceready to fire?\n- Are you testing on a device/emulator?\n. Hey I just tested your code and didn't have any problems.\nUsing Ionic Native 1.2.4 with cordova-sqlite-storage plugin version 1.4.1\n. I will close this for now.\nPlease test again with the latest plugin + ionic-native versions.\nIf you still have issues reopen and provide steps to reproduce.\nThanks!\n. Hey there\nThanks for opening an issue.\nThe email plugin is currently not working, it's an issue from the plugin\ndeveloper.  Waiting on the developer to fix the plugin before fixing the\nionic native implementation (if there are any problems with it).\nThanks for your patience.\nOn May 24, 2016 2:31 PM, \"Pekes317\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nUsing the isAviable method produces a promise undefined error.

See https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-email-composer/issues/209\n. Thanks for the request. Will add this.\n. I just had a look at that link again, and just realized it's not katzer's plugin. Maybe we should wait until it's implemented there to ensure stability.\n. Wouldn't browserify (or alternatives) import only the Observable module out of that file?\nIt was done to resolve this issue here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/170\nI tried importing the map operator like how you demonstrated with combineLatest and that didn't work. \nI will try to use combineLatest and see if that works.\n. Yeah I think the ^ is good enough. I remember I saw a notice in the CLI that peerDependencies will not be installed automatically any more. Which wouldn't be a good thing for ionic-native in case someone is using it with a non-ionic project.\nI will revert it back when I get a chance.\n. @Bouzmine It looks like a large plugin.

Your scenario seems like it's a problem with the plugin. But to be sure, we have to test the original plugin directly without using the ionic native wrappers. \n. @mbakker96 The issue was from ionic-native. There's an extra s at the end of the function name. It should be hasReadWritePermission(). Will be fixed in next release!\n. Sorry for the trouble everyone.\n\nI fixed the issue and published a new update (v1.2.4).\n. Don't remember why I left it as a TODO and didn't handle them. I will definitely revisit that at some point and complete it.\nAfter a quick look:\nThe original plugin is instantiated by using the following code:\njavascript\nvar media = new Media(src, mediaSuccess, [mediaError], [mediaStatus]);\nIdeally we would want mediaSuccess and mediaError to be bundled into a promise, and mediaStatus to output via an observable.\nTheoretically, the following should work as a quick fix:\n``` typescript\n@Plugin(...)\nexport class Media {\n// add two new properties\n  status: Observable;\n  init: Promise;\nconstructor(src: string) {\n// edit constructor\n    let res, rej, next;\n    this.init = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { res= resolve; rej = reject;});\n    this.status = new Observable((observer) => { next = observer.next; });\n    this._objectInstance = new Media(src, res, rej, next);\n  }\n}\n```\nThen you can do the following in your project:\n``` typescript\nlet media = new Media('path/to/file.mp3');\nmedia.init.then(...);\nmedia.status.subscribe(...);\n```\nYou can apply the fix yourself or wait for an official fix. To apply the fix yourself:\nClone repo -> edit media.ts -> run npm run build_bundle -> use the new dist directory in your project (node_modules/ionic-native/dist)\n. thanks @ghenry22 \n. Great.

Let's stick with #190 \n. Will be available in next release.\n. Hey @wwallace \nI see two mistakes with that code:\n1. It's GoogleMap not GoogleMaps ... (sorry if you are following out dated docs, it will be updated soon)\n2. You must create a new instance like this: let map = new GoogleMaps(...);\nSo your code should look like this:\n``` typescript\nimport {GoogleMap, GoogleMapsEvent} from 'ionic-native';\n...\nlet map = new GoogleMap('map');\nmap.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MAP_READY).subscribe(() => console.log(\"Map is ready!\"));\n```\n. Thanks @Bouzmine will fix it soon.\n. Hey @ZiFFeL1992 \nThanks for the PR\nI think there is no need for the if statement. You can pass options either way to the getMap function. It should be fine because if you look at the original plugin, the developer uses the following line of code: params = params || {};\n. Hey\nI just looked at your code.\nYou need to change this line:\npluginRef: 'cordova.plugin.background-mode',\nto this:\npluginRef: 'cordova.plugins.backgroundMode',\nUsually if the pluginRef you define isn't accessible, ionic native will assume that you don't have the plugin installed in your project.\nthe pluginRef for that plugin is documented here: https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-background-mode#usage\n. Thanks @pniraula \n. Thanks!\n. Works like a charm!\nDid a quick test here: https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic1-ionic-native-example/blob/master/www/js/app.js#L26-L29\n.

This has been added, and is currently available in the npm package version 1.3.3\n\nFor reference: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/270\n. TL;DR: No extra parameters are needed, just replace the inner functionality with return;\n\nExplaination:\nThe @Cordova() decorator takes care of the whole process. The default behavior for the decorator is to return a promise. The resolve and reject will be added as arguments to your function, all the way at the end, after every argument you have there.\nSo for example, let's assume we have a plugin that has the following method:\njavascript\nplugins.myPlugin.myMethod = function(optionA, optionB, successCallback, errorCallback) {\n  // do stuff here\n  try {\n    successCallback('return useful info');\n  } catch (e) {\n    errorCallback('return error');\n  }\n};\nTo wrap this up with ionic-native, we would write the following, and ionic-native will do the magic:\n``` typescript\n@Plugin({\n  plugin: 'cordova-my-plugin',\n  pluginRef: 'plugins.myPlugin',\n  repo: 'https://my.github/myuser/myrepo'\n})\nexport class MyPlugin {\n/*\n  * Some useful docs here!\n  /\n  @Cordova()\n  static myMethod(nameForOptionA: string, nameForOptionB: boolean): Promise {return; }\n}\n```\nNow if we call that method from our app. It will do the following:\n1. Check that plugins.myPlugin exists, if it doesn't, that means the plugin isn't installed.\n2. Creates a Promise (since it's the default behavior and we didn't pass config)\n3. Adds the resolve and reject variables from the promise, to the original plugin's function\n4. It calls the original method, and then the resolve or the reject will be triggered and it will transmit the data back to your app\nYou can configure the decorator to behave differently in case the original plugin is written in a different format.\nSo basically, when writing a wrapper, you don't need to add any functionality. That is because the decorators we use overwrites your method functionality. There are special cases, like defining a wrapper for a property, or defining an instance based plugin.\nThank you for contributing :grin:\n. Looks good now. Thanks @zakton5 !\n. As @Bouzmine said, you need to use the Globalization object that you imported from ionic-native.\nWhile using ionic-native there is usually no need to try and access the plugin through it's original reference. You just need the plugin to be installed, so ionic-native does the talking for you. \n. Thanks @Bouzmine !\n. Thanks @Bouzmine !\n. Hey,\nThis looks like a problem with the plugin itself. Do you experience these issues on all platforms? or just on iOS? \n. This is fixed now, there was an issue with the declaration of the plugin.\n. Hey @Bouzmine \nThanks for reporting this issue.\nThe problem is with the wrapper I created for that method. It's actually not a method, it's a property. (See https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-3dtouch#onhomeiconpressed)\nSince you are using the plugin, can you tell me which of the following is a better option:\n- Wrap the property, then use it as intended by the original developer, so your markup would look something like this:\n``` typescript\nimport {ThreeDeeTouch} from 'ionic-native';\n...\nThreeDeeTouch.onHomeIconPressed = (payload: any) => {\n// do something with payload.type\n// do something with payload.title\n};\n```\n- Write a custom wrapper so we can still provide an observable. The usage would be like this:\ntypescript\n// import plugin\n...\nlet subscription = ThreeDeeTouch.onHomeIconPressed().subscribe(\n  (payload: any) => {\n    // do stuff with data\n  }\n);\n...\n// then eventually stop processing that data\nsubscription.unsubscribe();\nI'm not so sure if wrapping it with an observable would really work, but it should :grin:\n..\nLet me know what you think is a better option, as I personally haven't used this plugin.\n. @mlynch Yes that's exactly what I meant. \n.

You need to wrap it with platform.onReady(), and you might need to move your code to be inside the constructor as well.\n. Not sure, I haven't tested this on iOS yet.\n\nCan you try to see if there are any logs from the Google Maps plugin?\nAlso check that you provided the variable --variable API_KEY_FOR_IOS while installing the plugin, see package.json\n. thanks @ZiFFeL1992 \n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Hey there,\nThanks for contributing to ionic-native.\nYour implementation is invoking the isBluetoothEnabled() function this way:\ncordova.plugins.locationManager.isBluetoothEnabled(function(res){ ... }, function(err){ ... }); \nReason: that's what the @Cordova() decorator does (with the default options).\n\nI just had a look at the docs for that function here. \nThe iBeacon plugin is relatively odd. They return a Q promise with each function call (not sure about all functions, but this is the case for the one you're working with now). \nWe can do one of the following:\n- Return that promise as-is (use @Cordova({ sync: true }); and it will do that for you, keep return type as Promise). I'm not sure if this will work since we're dealing with different promise libraries here.\n- Add a new option to the @Cordova decorator that will convert any promise to the promise type we're using. (ionic-native returns back a promise that is compatible with your environment, ES-6 promise or Angular1 promise). \nI would give the first option a shot first, if that doesn't work well in all scenarios then we can look into modifying the @Cordova decorator to work with this plugin.\n. Hey @Ritzlgrmft \nPlease see this: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/270\n. Thanks @bvx89 \n. Hey there,\nI had a quick look at the plugin wrapper and the latest version of the plugin. I can't see a reason why the plugin would have this issue.\nCould you try and do the following, add this code at the top of your app's main file:\ntypescript\ndeclare var cordova: any;\nconsole.log(\"barcodeScanner exists: \" + !!cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner);\nThen compile & run on your device. and check your console output to see if that variable exists in memory.\nAlternatively, you may just interact with the console and try to see if cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner exists.\nThis will help narrow down the issue from being plugin related or ionic-native related. If that variable exists in memory then we know that ionic-native is having trouble communicating with the plugin.\n. You're right @keithdmoore .. Thanks for pointing it out!\n. @elluminatte please update to ionic-native@1.3.1 and let me know if you still have issues.\n. Hey there,\nThose interfaces are being exported here.\nPlease check that you are using the latest version of:\n- ionic-native (currently at 1.3.0). Run npm i --save ionic-native@latest\n- IDE and/or TypeScript plugin in IDE\nHere's a screenshot of my experiment: \n\n. See my reply to the issue #245 \n. Hey,\nThanks for pointing it out.\nWe will have to rewrite the Push plugin using the @CordovaInstance wrapper in order to achieve that functionality. I guess we can add that to the road map (no set date, though).\n. Sorry about that, tsconfig was miss configured. Just release 1.3.2, please update your project and let me know if you are still experiencing issues.\n. Hey there,\nGreat work, thanks for submitting the PR!\nIt just needs some simple fixes, see the comments I left on the code.\n. Perfect! Thanks @Inoverse \n. Hey there,\nI agree, we should have some sort of fallback or error handling so you can continue to develop your app using the serve feature.\nWe can easily let it process the function only if the plugin is defined (which is how other ionic-native plugins work). As for your suggestion (having a JS fallback), I'm not so sure if it will be compatible that way. We have to make sure that the method names match a 100% for it to be an easy process. Also, since the plugin uses native SDK, it will require the user to load the Google Maps JavaScript library in order for it to work. \n. I opened an issue with the plugin's developers and they said they want to keep their focus on native SDKs  and they're not interested in adding JavaScript fallback. \nThis sort of functionality isn't something that suits the purpose of ionic-native either. I think it has to be a separate wrapper with it's own NPM package that depends on ionic-native (or not).\nI think the idea is doable and I do think that it is useful, at least for development purposes.\n. File plugin is currently being rewritten. This issue should be resolved once the new plugin wrapper is released. I'll keep this open so you get notified when the plugin is published.\n. Just noticed a few mistakes with the wrapper.\nPlease update to ionic-native@1.3.5 and try again.\n. thanks for your feedback @F1ow \nI will close this for now. Let me know if you're still having issues @Bouzmine \n. Hey there,\nThis issue looks like a problem with the plugin itself, not the wrapper we created.\nI suggest you post your issue at the plugin's repository instead.\n. Should be fixed now.\nThe plugin not installed error happens when ionic-native fails to find the pluginRef provided in the wrapper definition. The pluginRef was set to plugins.backgroundGeoLocation instead of backgroundGeolocation\n. Hey @danbucholtz \nAFAIK the Angular change detection gets triggered when a promise resolves (or other events...). In the case of the keyboard plugin, the original plugin doesn't handle onSucess and onError, therefore we can't return a promise that resolves once the keyboard is shown/hidden (unless if we override the wrapper, but it won't be perfect since the promise may resolve too early).\nWhat I suggest is to modify the functionality for ionic-plugin-keyboard and add onSucess and onError parameters. See here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugin-keyboard/blob/master/www/android/keyboard.js#L11-L25\nI don't have experience writing Cordova plugins, but I can submit a PR for that if you want.\n. Sorry closed by accident.\n. FYI @danbucholtz : https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugin-keyboard/pull/215\n. @danbucholtz I can see that :grin:\n\n. Hey @danbucholtz ,\nSorry I just realized this now, but we already have event listeners implemented in the plugin definition.\nHave a look here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/keyboard.ts#L58-L76\nSo to rewrite your code, it would be something like this:\n```\nimport {Keyboard} from 'ionic-native';\nKeyboard.onKeyboardShow().subscribe(()=> { \n    console.log('KEYBOAD SHOW');\n    self.controlShowHide['cancelButton'] = true;\n    console.log(\"keyboardShowHandler Value is: \", self.controlShowHide['cancelButton']);\n})\n\n```\n. This already exists.\n. @andreafoorlan Just pushed a commit, it will be visible on the next docs update\n. I think the error here is caused by an unhandled promise rejection. \nFirst I thought it's because you're not handling the promise rejection on ActionSheet.hide().. Then I realized the wrapper for that function is missing the options optional parameter. See https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-actionsheet/blob/master/www/ActionSheet.js#L8\nThis causes ionic-native to pass resolve and reject to options and resolve ... meaning whenever this resolves, it causes ionic-native to reject. \n. Hey @Luchillo \nYou're using SqlStorage from ionic-angular package. That is part of Ionic Framework 2.0. (AFAIK)\nThis repo is for the Native section only. http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/\nThere is SQLite plugin that is a part of ionic-native, which you can use instead of SqlStorage if you would like ... Not sure which one is a better wrapper.\n. Well the code here is just a wrapper. The original plugin would have to\nprovide that fallback feature.\nOn Jul 2, 2016 3:17 AM, \"Carlos Esteban Lopez Jaramillo\" \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI do know this is the native repo, i was looking to see if i would be\nbetter transitioning from SqlStorage to ionic-native sqlite solution,\nhowever i have been digging in the code and i see nothing about handling\nboth sqlite and websql cases, specifically the open database function:\nsqlite.ts#L69-L80\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/sqlite.ts#L69-L80\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/263#issuecomment-230088428,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/ANJ8dAP5SU-MYCBqJVmTp_uTQRQahz5Wks5qRhCTgaJpZM4JDeo6\n.\n.

Hey there,\nAccording to your stack trace it looks like the ondeviceready fired 165ms after your code tried creating a latlng instance. \nMy best guess is that plugin wasn't defined yet and your app tried calling it. \nCan you find out where that method is called and wrap it with a platform.onReady().then(..) .. or just the usual ondeviceready event listener. \nLet me know if the issue is from the usage or from the way the wrapper is written.\nThanks\n. Can you recreate the issue using the plugin's original methods? \nIf the issues are still happening, then it could be a problem with Angular2/Ionic, we might need to place some code in the OnInit or AfterViewChecked ...\nIf the issues don't occur using the plugin's original API then I think we can be certain that it's an ionic-native issue.\n. Hey\nThanks for the PR.. great work.\nJust a question, I see you are using @Cordova({ sync: true }) with a return type of a promise. Does the original plugin's method return a promise?\n. Perfect, thanks!\n. Hey @justinschuldt \nI just looked at the code again and noticed a problem. \nI'm not sure how the Delegate object is supposed to work. From the look of it I think it's not working as you expect it to do so. The methods that return observables are not making sense to me. \nI think a better way to implement it is to create a whole new class just for Delegate. \nShould be something like this:\n``` typescript\nexport class Delegate {\n  private _objectInstance: any;\n  constructor(){\n    this._objectInstance = new cordova.plugins.locationManager.Delegate();\n  }\ndidChangeAuthorizationStatus(): Observable {\n    return new Observable((observer)=>{\n      // bind to observer on subscribe\n      this._objectInstance.didChangeAuthorizationStatus = observer.next.bind(observer);\n      // bind to noop on unsubscribe\n      return () => this._objectInstance.didChangeAuthorizationStatus = () => {};\n    });\n  }\n// add other events the same way\n}\n```\n. @Ritzlgrmft any thoughts on my comment above ^ ? \n. Thanks for the feedback Markus.\nI wasn't sure since I don't use this plugin and to be honest I never even\nworked with iBecons.\nJust wanted to point it out to make sure that the plugin is fully\nfunctional and is implemented the best way possible.\nThanks again!\nOn Jul 18, 2016 3:28 AM, \"Markus Wagner\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@ihadeed https://github.com/ihadeed At least one important statement is\nmissing in your proposal:\ncordova.plugins.locationManager.setDelegate(this._objectInstance);\nBut this should be called not before all needed events are subscribed.

If anyone has any results please post here.\n. We would need more data to work with here. Such as a more detailed stack trace and maybe steps to reproduce.\nI think it's worth mentioning that you need to wrap all method calls with ondeviceready event listener. Which is platform.onReady().then(()=> { ... }) in ionic 2\n. Here's the syntax:\n``` typescript\nimport {InAppBrowser, InAppBrowserRef} from 'ionic-native';\n...\nlet browser: InAppBrowserRef = InAppBrowser.open(url, target, options);\nbrowser.show();\nbrowser.close();\nbrowser.addEventListener(type, callback);\nbrowser.executeScript(script, callback);\nbrowser.insertCSS(css, callback);\n```\nThis plugin will be rewritten soon to provide better and more complete functionality. The new version of the wrapper will eliminate all callbacks and replace them with Promises instead. \n. It's not published yet. I'll publish a new release when I get a chance.\nIn the meanwhile you can clone the master branch, run npm install to\ninstall dependencies.. then run \"npm run build\" to generate a new dist\ndirectory.\nOn Jul 15, 2016 9:15 AM, \"Tamer\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@ihadeed https://github.com/ihadeed how to implement the last version\nof ionic-native with this modification ?

Hey\nI just used the plugin and it worked fine. The promise is resolving on success and rejecting on failure.\ntypescript\n                        let upload_url: string = data.data.upload_url;\n                        let image_url: string = data.data.public_url;\n                        let transfer = new Transfer();\n                        let options: FileUploadOptions = {\n                          httpMethod: 'PUT',\n                          chunkedMode: false,\n                          headers: {\n                            'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg'\n                          }\n                        };\n                        transfer.upload(pic, upload_url, options)\n                          .then(\n                            () => updateAvatar(image_url),\n                            (e)=>console.error(e)\n                          );\n. No my response didn't contain JSON data, but I don't think that has any effects. \nThe plugin decides to resolve/reject based on the HTTP status of the response, not based on the response body.\nI suggest you use a tool like Postman to upload an image to your API and see what the response looks like.\n. Hey there,\nThanks for the PR.\n1. The property Direction is not really needed, but it's not a big deal.\n2. All the functions should have the following decorator instead, since we aren't wrapping any callback function parameters: @Cordova({ sync: true })\n3. Add : void after each function to help IDE's know that they shouldn't expect anything back from invoking these functions\n4. Missing the following functions: setFlashMode, setColorEffect, disable ... See https://github.com/westonganger/cordova-plugin-camera-preview/blob/master/www/CameraPreview.js\nAlso two more functions are missing: setOnPictureTakenHandler and setOnLogHandler .. but I think these should be wrapped differently to return back an Observable instead. Perhaps something like:\ntypescript\n@Cordova({\n  observable: true\n})\nstatic setOnPictureTakenHandler(): Observable<any> { return; }\nIt can be used like this:\ntypescript\nCameraPreview.setOnPictureTakenHandler().subscribe((data) => console.log(data));\n. If they're not implemented yet then there is no need to add wrappers for them. \nThanks again @rbouleau \n. Perfect!\nThank you @rbouleau \n. this.cameraPreview ? Are you injecting it?\n. To use setOnPictureTakenHandler you need to use code that looks like this:\ntypescript\nCemraPreview.setOnPictureTakenHandler().subscribe((data) => {\n  // do something with data\n});\nThat method returns back an observable that you have to subscribe to and provide the callback there.\n. ``` typescript\nimport {CordovaPreview} from 'ionic-native';\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: 'build/pages/hello-ionic/hello-ionic.html'\n})\nexport class HelloIonicPage {\nconstructor() { }\nonCameraPreview(result: Array) {\n    this.originalPicture = result[0];\n    this.previewPicture = result[0];\n}\nstartCapturing(side) {\n    CameraPreview.setOnPictureTakenHandler().subscribe((result) => {\n      this.onCameraPreview(result);\n    });\n}\n}\n``\n. Ionic Native wrappers aren't Injectable at the moment. They are just static classes (some are instance based). \n. Yes you must be running on a device or an emulator to use any of the plugins.\n. I haven't used Ionic View in awhile, but AFAIK it doesn't support plugins. You need to useionic run androidorionic emulate android` to test this.\n.

You should wait for ondeviceready the first time you create the database, no need to call it every time you do a transaction afterwards.\n\nAs for the usage, follow the Native docs example:\n``` ts\nimport { SQLite } from 'ionic-native';\n// wrap this with ondeviceready or platform.ready()\nlet db = new SQLite();\ndb.openDatabse({\n  name: 'data.db',\n   location: 'default' // the location field is required\n }).then(() => {\n db.executeSql('create table danceMoves(name VARCHAR(32))', {}).then(() => {\n}, (err) => {\n     console.error('Unable to execute sql', err);\n   })\n }, (err) => {\n   console.error('Unable to open database', err);\n });\n```\nI personally wouldn't be able to help you beyond this point as I haven't used the plugin thoroughly yet.\nAFAIK the SqlStorage that's bundled with Ionic Framework 2 has browser fallback to WebSQL. This plugin lacks this feature, which means you will be stuck developing on a device/emulator whenever you need to use the database. \n. This plugin only has 1 callback, so it should resolve in all cases. (unless if I did a mistake while writing the wrapper)\nWhat does the promise rejection message say?\n. It's a problem with the plugin. I'm  m\nsurprised it doesn't have any similar issues at their repo. Probably\nbecause it's not a popular plugin.\nI tried it a year ago and I remember it was horrible.\nI suggest using ionic 2 alerts\nOn Jul 25, 2016 3:23 AM, \"Martijn Bakker\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIs this a bug in ionic native or in the plugin itselfs?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/339#issuecomment-234863602,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANJ8dPli-3CLdoChIa2E7pPNFS9n7SHfks5qZGRugaJpZM4JQxp1\n.\n. We're not keeping usage in the JSDoc for each function. All usage info should be in the @usage or @advanced sections at the top (in the docs for the @Plugin decorator. \n\nSee 3rd item here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/271\n. Yes I'm aware of that. You can actually import it from facebook.d.ts in the latest ionic-native version. \nThe next version will fix this issue. I'll keep this open for reference.\n. This would be an issue with the plugin, please open an issue at their repo.\n. We have a new file plugin in the PR section. https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/283\n. Sure, you're right.\n. Read the comments.\nAlso I think we should follow what Max did with the SQLite plugin here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/f1c8ce35e85d9ddebf7288e9c1abb5e70811d23d\nThis way we can keep the ionic-native modifications consistent.\nThe usage would be something like:\ntypescript\nlet secureStorage: SecureStorage = new SecureStorage();\nsecureStorage.create(<options>).then(<onSuccess>).catch(<onError>);\n. Looks good @begriffin \nThank you for the PR!\n. I'm thinking the create function should be refactored to something like openStorage. Since that function would open the database if the name exists. (similar to SQLite behaviour).\nWhat do you guys think?\n. For promises, you can just use them directly without having to modify anything. \nBefore wrapping any method call, Ionic Native attempts to find ES6 Promise support, if that's not found, it will attempt to find window.angular (if found, will use $q), and if that's not found either it will throw a console.warn to let you know that you need to add a polyfill for promise support.\nAs for observables, I haven't done any experiments with that yet but I guess that it should work out of the box since the files ionic.native.js and ionic.native.min.js are produced by a browserify command that should pull all the required code from rxjs package.\nI will close this for now, but do reopen or comment if you have further questions or difficulties. \n. Thanks @sameera207 \n. thanks!\n. Hey there,\nWhy did you change the Promise to a Callback?\nIs it because that callback gets triggered multiple times? If that's the case we can convert the return type to an Observable instead.\n. @Corova({\n  observable: true\n})\nstatic methodName(): Observable<any> {return; }\n. thanks\n. This is an issue with the plugin and not with it's Ionic Native wrapper.\n. Hey this looks great\nI just think the observables all need to have clearWithArgs: true since the plugin needs it, see https://github.com/evothings/phonegap-estimotebeacons/blob/master/plugin/src/js/EstimoteBeacons.js#L726\n. It would look like this:\ntypescript\n @Cordova({\n    observable: true,\n    clearFunction: 'stopSomeMethod',\n    clearWithArgs: true\n  })\n  static startSomeMethod(someArg): Observable<any> { return; }\nIt applies the same arguments that were supplied to the start function when cancelling the watch. \nSee: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/plugin.ts#L139-L144\nI'll try to add docs to the developer guide soon.\n. Hey I just had another look\n1. The default for TypeScript is public so there is no need to state that before the property names\n2. Saw some extra docs in the file, are they supposed to explain something? If so, it's better to move them somewhere more appropriate.\n. thanks @fabLouis \n. Hey there,\nThis plugin (and a few others) is instance based. You need to do something like the following:\njavascript\nvar transfer = new $cordovaTransfer();\ntransfer.upload(...);\n. @mlynch can you have a look at this when you get a chance?\n. @felipetoffolo1 can you try to use the plugin via the global variable IonicNative.. \nexample:\njavascript\nvar transfer = new IonicNative.Transfer();\ntransfer.upload(...)\n. Can you try this again using the latest version of ionic-native ? Seems to be working fine here\n. Hey Raymond,\nThanks for opening this issue.

You need to split the file URI into path and file name, then pass those to the readAsArrayBuffer method.\nHere is an example: (or here)\ntypescript\n        Camera.getPicture()\n          .then(imageData => {\n            const fileName = imageData.split('/').pop();\n            const path = imageData.replace(fileName, '');\n            return File.readAsArrayBuffer(path, fileName);\n          })\n          .then(response => {\n            console.log('File response is: ', response);\n          })\n          .catch(console.error.bind(console));. @dbpieter can you share the code so I can have a look?. @joewoodhouse it might be a good idea to ask your question here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base. @albe-rosado \nFile plugin doesn't work with ionic serve.\nTest your app on a device using latest version of Ionic Native and the plugin. If you are still experiencing any issues, please open a new issue.. This would be something to discuss over at the Ionic Framework repo since this would be a framework feature, not an Ionic Native feature.\n. I understand what you're asking for.\nIonic Native provides a wrapper for Cordova plugins. The wrapper emulates\nthe original plugins' APIs.\nIn order to make the Native Storage (or other type of storage) compatible\nwith the Ionic Framework's Storage Engine, we need to write another wrapper\nthat extends the StorageEngine class. This is something that can not be\npart of  Ionic Native, it should be part of the Ionic Framework.\nI'm not saying this idea is being rejected, I'm actually with you on it.\nI'm just saying this is not the right place to discuss it.\nI recommend that you open an issue at the Ionic repository (where the\nStorageEngine class is).\nOn Sep 1, 2016 12:54 AM, \"imgx64\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThis feature already exists in Ionic 2 (Storage, StorageEngine,\nIStorageEngine), and it's already implemented by SqlStorage and\nLocalStorage (see here\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic/tree/master/src/platform/storage).\nWhat I'm asking for is to simply implement it in NativeStorage, which is\npart of Ionic Native.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/507#issuecomment-243975782,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANJ8dAWmQ2ecywuUQRowjT1Zx_Ho98nSks5qllp1gaJpZM4JwNeQ\n.\n. thanks\n. thanks\n.

See my example here: https://gist.github.com/ihadeed/9e6cb11eb3ab3efc8ccf3a08ced90bf7\n. @ZiFFeL1992 I'm experiencing delays too, but they occur while using the original plugin API as well. It usually happens the first time the user tries to share something after launching the app.\n. thanks for the PR @ramonornela \n. Hey there,\nThe original plugin's API only has one callback for success that gets called if the CSS was inserted successfully. So the promise will never reject unless if an error occurred inside the Ionic Native code.\nIf you can give me more information related to the error that would be great.\n. Hey I just tried using insertCSS and it worked. Maybe the remote the URL you're using isn't white listed? or perhaps it could be some CORS issues?\n. @tomgallagher one solution could be to use the SafariView plugin for iOS to avoid these issues.\nThanks for the information btw!\n.

Thansk @mattlewis92 .. great work!\n. Hey there,\n\nYes you can add your custom plugin to Ionic 2.\nSince Ionic 2 uses TypeScript (by default) you might encounter some errors\nwhile using a custom plugin.\nWhat you need to do is add a line at the top of the page to declare the\nvariable that you are using. For example, if the plugin is called via\ncordova.plugins.camera .. You need to add this line the top of your .ts\npage to avoid errors:\ndeclare var cordova: any;\nThat line will tell the IDE and the compiler to ignore any calls made to\nthat variable (and its child properties/methods).\nIt's worth noting that when you use plugins this way, you need to wrap it\nwith a couple if statements to make sure it doesn't throw errors while\nrunning on a browser or an unsupported device. (Ionic Native handles that\nfor you)\nAlso, you can always submit an issue here to request a plugin to be added\nso you can use them through Ionic Native. We just need the plugin name and\nthe link to their repository.\nOn Sep 3, 2016 2:42 AM, \"DILEEP YADAV\" notifications@github.com wrote:\nHi!

Can you try with the latest version v2.2.2 and report back? Thanks.\n. I just had a look. Looks like the configure function doesn't return back a promise. Instead, it takes success and error callbacks like the original plugin does.\nI'm not sure why it's setup that way, it should have @Cordova({ callbackOrder: 'reverse' }) instead of @Cordova({sync: true}) and return back a promise instead. \n. Just had a look again. It's not a bug.\nThe wrapper is designed that way because these callbacks are not called when the .configure() function is executed, they're called when the plugin fetches a new location or throws an error. \n@danielgek you don't need to use typings when you're using ionic-native.\n. thanks\n.

Sorry I meant @CordovaFunctionOverride not CordovaOverride\n. @ramonornela sorry just had a look at the decorator again, it's not what we need here. But I was thinking we can create a decorator that will let us make sure that the plugin exists before running the function.\n. I think it's good enough to just have the check happen in the constructor of GoogleMap class and maybe the GeoCoder too. Running the check at every instance method doesn't make that much sense, it helps but not really necessary. The developer should notice the warning from the constructor. \n. Sure we can do something like if(!this._objectInstance) return;\n. Looks good. Let's revisit this later and add utility functions in plugin.ts that return back Promise.reject({ error: 'plugin_not_installed' }); and that observable that returns an error. So we don't have to rewrite the same thing many times.\n. I just tried this and it works.\nCan you run npm i --save ionic-native@latest to make sure it's the latest version? \n. Just pushed a commit (not merged yet) that makes resolveLocalFilesystemUrl and resolveDirectoryUrl methods public instead of private. They return a promise that resolves with Entry and DirectoryEntry respectively. \n. And I just made getFile and getDirectory public as well.\n. > Do I really have to use the low-level window.resolveLocalFilesystemUrl\nYou will still have to do something like that. Ionic Native exports a wrapper for that function as well. You will need to do something like:\n```\nFile.resolveDirectoryUrl('path/to/dir')\n  .then((directoryEntry: DirectoryEntry) => {\n    File.getFile(directoryEntry, 'myFile.txt', { create: false })\n      .then((fileEntry: FileEntry) => {\n        ....\n      });\n  });\n```\n. This could be caused by this edit here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/72a694a5e1a61d8743e742ebe7431bafd3f0ed4d#diff-7380fd903dab74ddcc7e9b47a00b3156R884\n.addMarker() is expecting an object with the properties lat and lng. We're passing an object with the property _objectInstance and two getter functions that will bring the values of lat and lng. Maybe the .addMarker() function does not work with getters and it needs static properties. \nIf it works with 2.0.3 but not the latest version, then this is most likely the issue.\nI will look into it soon.\n. Should be fixed now, please update to ionic-native@2.1.8\n. This would be an issue to address at the ionic-site repo. Old folders don't get deleted automatically by the doc generator.

According to this page https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#databases the\nonly difference seems to be the static  constructor (openDatabase).

This would be an issue with the plugin or with crosswalk.\n. @Tobiaswk what version of Ionic are you using? . You gotta wait for deviceready to fire. Wrap it with platform.ready().then(() => { ... })\n. @golear91 Yes you have to wait for deviceready before talking to any native API. \n\nWe might be implementing built-in event listener for all the async functions in v2.3.0 of Ionic Native.\nAlso, it is documented here that you have to wait for deviceready.\n. thanks @ramonornela !!\n. This should work:\n```\nBackgroundMode.onactivate().subscribe(() => {\n});\n```\nCan you share the code you're using?\n. thanks @ColinFrick \n. thanks\n. Will resubmit for v3 if needed. Will resubmit for v3. I don't understand your reason behind opening this issue @christocracy \n. We don't have any wrappers for your plugins. If you're talking about the background geolocation, we aren't providing any support for your plugin and we don't intend to do so. Our BackgroundGeolocation class wraps this fork here: https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation\n. We do not maintain anyone's plugins API at Ionic Native. We simply provide wrappers with few extra features for those who would like to use it. And anyways, we do not have a wrapper for any of your plugins.\nAs for your concern about the ionic plugin command behaviour; I suggest you talk to the maintainers of the ionic-cli repo. AFAIK, the Ionic CLI doesn't do much when it comes to installing plugins. They let the Cordova CLI handle that.\nRepo link: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli\nPlugin command code: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli/blob/master/lib/ionic/plugin.js\n. thanks\n. thanks @ascorbic !\n. Yes, thanks!. Yeah that's because we're using export declare class Ndef { ... I had similar issues with other plugins earlier. I think the new build process for Ionic Framework doesn't like these kind of exports.\nWe would have to do something else like here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/b95f88c#diff-a740ceecb06436e4f3c45e162549de31R111\n. No the Ndef class comes with the NFC plugin. It is the only thing that needs to be modified. It needs to be converted to a regular class instead of declare class, then add plugin and pluginRef private properties that match the NFC class. Then add @Cordova({ sync: true }) decorators to each function.\nJust like what I did there with the mixpanel plugin\n. How's this different than File.resolveFileSystemUri() ?\n. Thanks @ColinFrick \n. This plugin is more configurable and it works differently, some people might prefer it over ZBar. Also has browser platform support. \n. platforms/<platform name>/platform_www/cordova_plugins.js has an export metadata that we can read to identify the versions of the plugins. \nHere's what it looks like:\n```\nmodule.exports.metadata = \n{\n    \"cordova-clipboard\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"cordova-plugin-actionsheet\": \"2.3.1\",\n    \"cordova-plugin-app-version\": \"0.1.9\",\n    \"cordova-plugin-dialogs\": \"1.3.0\",\n    \"cordova-plugin-globalization\": \"1.0.4\",\n    \"cordova-plugin-apprate\": \"1.2\",\n    \"cordova-plugin-call-number\": \"1.0.1\",\n    \"cordova-plugin-compat\": \"1.0.0\",\n....\n};\n```\nWe can do something like cordova.require('cordova/plugin_list').metadata to get that object. \n. Just had a look. Our wrapper isn't designed for the repo you mentioned, it follows this plugin here: https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-imagePicker\nWhat is the issue what you're having with the plugin?\n. Seems like it is camel case over here too: http://definitelytyped.org/docs/cordova--cordova/interfaces/fileentry.html\n. thanks, added now and will be available in the next release\n.

I think we should wait till they release v2 stable then we can update our wrapper. . @jstoup111 that's an issue with the plugin.. @RafaelKr \nYou should build it based on the v3-injectable branch since that will be the next release. If you build it based on v3 or master we can port it later on to v3-injectable.\nYou should modify the existing definitions to match the updated API. There is no need to create a new one. \nPlease note that we're still not going to merge it until Google Maps plugin v2 is stable (they announced that it will be released very soon). .

See https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4/issues/149\n\nIf you are still having issues contact the plugin's maintainers  https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4\n. What version of Ionic Native?\n. Can you share your code\n. Are you waiting for deviceready to fire before you call any plugin functions? \n. Yes, but it's not merged yet.. Sounds like an issue with crosswalk and not with Ionic Native. Closing this. Please let me know if you only have this issue with Ionic Native then we can re-open this and investigate.. You still have to wait for deviceready to fire even if you are using Ionic Native wrapper. We still don't automatically wrap things with a deviceready listener. \n. Sorry for the late response. That was a typo. It should be geodesic not googledesic. Just fixed it.. thanks!\n. How is it not correct?\n. Thanks just fixed it. @zefrench could you provide steps to reproduce this issue?\nThis usually just happens when you're running on livereload or using your IP address to preview the app instead of localhost. Also make sure that you have the plugin cordova-plugin-geolocation installed as it will use native code to retrieve your location instead of using the web API.. @shaneparsons make sure you have the plugin installed. @shaneparsons you need to do both. Importing Geolocation from the ionic-native package will not install the plugin for you. You need to install cordova-plugin-geolocation and then use the API provided by ionic-native.. @shaneparsons ionic serve runs your app as a website on the browser. You can't test plugins that way.. @shaneparsons this is just something that has to do with the browser, not with with the plugin/ionic-native. You can't get the location on non-https hosts. On the browser the plugin uses Web API to get your location, Chrome & Firefox are ok with giving location to localhost because they know it's for development. Safari is not ok with that, they need https no matter where you are.. @zefrench I already replied to you. See my first comment on this issue.. @zefrench do you only get this issue with livereload?. You're getting the error here: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/b13cbdeb160badc153390bd11212334c964ebaa9/src/android/CameraLauncher.java#L806\nThis is not an issue caused by the Ionic Native wrapper. I suggest you contact them via their issue tracker to get more help: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera#how-to-contribute. Is there a specific plugin you are asking us to add?\nI found one here: https://github.com/macdonst/SpeechRecognitionPlugin\nLet me know if there are other plugins that you think are good.. This was added awhile ago. Sorry I forgot to update this issue.. I don't think this is necessary. This should be common JavaScript knowledge. There is no need to assign a variable name if you aren't planning on referring to the object later on.. Did you install the plugin cordova-plugin-secure-storage ? Also are you running on a device/emulator?. This seems to be an issue related to the plugin and not an issue with the wrapper. Please open check existing issues or open an issue here: https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation/issues. Do you have the plugin installed? Are you running on a device/simulator? Does the getPictures method work?. Sometimes we get the error Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined if our callCordovaPlugin (plugin.ts line 104) is unable to find the method we are referring to (for many reasons). . Oh yeah, sorry.\nThis is the correct repo for the wrapper we are using: https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/ImagePicker\nI updated it recently but forgot to change the repo url. . Updated it, should be fixed in the next docs update.. There was a recent patch that was not included in your fork so I think you didn't see it yet. The current code is as follows:\nconst getFileOpts: Flags = {\n      create: !('create' in options) || options.create,\n      exclusive: !!options.replace\n    };\nI'm not sure what is a better option to use, create or append. They both make sense in this situation. We can use them both and prioritize one of them. (create: ((create in options) && !!options.create) || !options.append)`)\nAs for the exclusive option, you're right. I can see here https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/master/src/android/LocalFilesystem.java#L140-L145 if the file exists and we have both create and exclusive set to true, the operation will fail. . Yeah that makes sense. Just pushed a commit to fix this.\n. This is an issue to discuss at the plugin's repo since it's not an issue with the Ionic Native wrapper. \nhttps://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-background-mode/issues. Thanks\nThe callback is actually optional. I just fixed the typing and updated the docs.. @trollwinner \nI can't see the new features you're talking about on the plugins repo: https://github.com/cordova-plugin-camera-preview/cordova-plugin-camera-preview\nCanvasCamera had issues and we decided to take remove it from Ionic Native.. Both repos are being updated recently. They have been confusing. Will stick with the original repo until there's solid evidence that the fork is better and more stable. . Sorry there is nothing we can do on our end. You will have to contact the developers to ask them to fix this or use an alternative plugin that supports front facing camera. Your app users will still be able to use their front camera but they have to select it manually when the camera app launches.. This is fixed here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/867400d1ac1471d0ab7c036ca471fcce557d7281#diff-9c468d792814968d6a9ecd58630290cbR682\nYour fork is outdated. Please try with the latest version of Ionic Native and report back if the issue still exists. @wwoods . Just had a look at the issue you submitted here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/789\nYou're right it does need to be fixed. Please check my comment there and maybe submit a new PR to fix the latest repo code. . The wrapper we have for GoogleMaps is for an older version. We haven't\nupdated it yet.\nUse their API directly for now, or downgrade to an older version. Not sure\nwhat the version number is, I'm on my phone right now.\nOn Nov 17, 2016 1:17 AM, \"Santu Koley\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI want to use following feature listed in cordova-plugin-googlemaps but\nalways getting this error.\nhttps://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/\nwiki/Marker#add-your-data-and-hold-them\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/798, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANJ8dOpDQJjBR6zSDKs31nTBBC9acY2Rks5q-_FygaJpZM4K05T3\n.\n.

Thanks.\nThe Cordova decorators need to have callbackOrder set to reverse. I will edit that before publishing.. @perrygovier @mlynch we already have a way to override install commands, just add install in the @Plugin() decorator meta.\nExample: \nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/deeplinks.ts#L67. We don't need to do anything to support that. The options take parameter takes type of any so you can pass any parameters. . @phattranky which Ionic Native version?. Hey there,\nUnfortunately, I wasn't able to reproduce this issue.\nI'm working with a fresh Ionic 2 project. I installed the plugin by running the command ionic plugin add https://github.com/card-io/card.io-Cordova-Plugin then I executed the following code:\n```ts\n    this.platform.ready().then(() => {\n      CardIO.canScan().then((canScan: boolean) => {\n    console.log('Can scan:', canScan);\n\n    if (canScan) {\n      CardIO.scan({})\n        .then(data => console.log('Scanned: ', data))\n        .catch(e => console.log('Error scanning: ', e));\n    }\n  })\n  .catch(e => console.log('Error checking if can scan: ', e));\n\n});\n\n``. @CHOMNANP Ionic View only has a few plugins that are bundled in the binary. You can't add custom plugins to it. You can try using--livereloadflag when running on device/simulator for faster debugging. I think for now it has an issue though with the plugins so you will have to wait for the nextionic-cliandionic-app-scripts` release.. @mhartington \nWe can definitely add the j3k0 IAP plugin. I'll try to implement it over the next couple of weeks. \nThey both seem to have tons of issues, I can't really decide which one is the ideal choice since I never used any of them. So I'm not sure if we should remove the old plugin in 4.x as of now. We can (1) do a community vote/survey to decide, or (2) keep both of them and document their pros/cons and leave it up to the developer to pick what they want.. Hey guys,\nI just implemented the plugin here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/179f87b606779c05cc6f565be1883009cd430808\nI didn't test it, and I'm not 100% sure if this is the most efficient implementation.. I might see more room for improvement once I review it again.\nIn the meanwhile, I would appreciate it if you can test it out and let me know if there are any bugs or suggestions.\n\nRun the following command to install the plugin npm i --save @ionic-native/in-app-purchase-2\nImport InAppPurchase2 class from @ionic-native/in-app-purchase-2 (to your service/component and your NgModule)\nUse the plugin as documented in their repo. The only difference is:\n.read() function returns a Promise instead of taking a callback. @thielCole I haven't tried the plugin personally. \n\nI think that .ready() fires as soon as the store is ready. Which occurs before the product is actually registered. \nDid you try listening to the registered event?\nts\nthis.store.when(productId, 'registered', product => console.log(product));. @thielCole I'm assuming your most recent PR fixes this issue.. @thielCole thanks for the feedback.\nI will publish this in the next release. Just need to figure out if this should be in-app-purchase2 or just in-app-purchase.. I personally would rather not rename the first plugin and cause a breaking change, unless if we are going to use the new plugin as the primary IAP plugin. \nI think for now I'll just keep it as in-app-purchase2 until we get more feedback from the community. If the old plugin starts causing issues, and the majority of the users like the new plugin, then we can switch the names. Maybe we should leave the renaming till the next major release(s) .. . @thielCole what's wrong with the docs?. @thielCole oh ok, that was fixed recently by https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/1791. It's just not available on the production site yet. See http://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com/docs/native/in-app-purchase-2/. ~~How about creating a base interface with optional methods/properties. Then make all plugins implement it.~~ Nevermind, this doesn't work.\n```typescript\nexport interface IPlugin {\n  /*\n   * Checks if plugin is installed\n   /\n  installed?(): boolean;\n  pluginName?: string;\n  plugin?: string;\n  pluginRef?: string;\n  repo?: string;\n  platforms?: string[];\n}\nexport class Camera implements IPlugin { ... }\n```. Figured it out...\n\n. These error messages come from the plugin. You need to request this feature at the plugin's issue tracker. . @barocsi do you have the plugin installed? Are you running on device or simulator?. Thanks for the feedback @dalezak I will look into this.. @mebibou plugins don't work in the browser you need to test on a device or a simulator.. @dalezak @barocsi I wasn't able to reproduce the results you are having.\nI created a fresh Ionic 2 project, installed the plugin using the command ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-nativestorage then used this code:\n```ts\n    this.platform.ready().then(() => {\n      NativeStorage.setItem('myitem', {property: 'value', anotherProperty: 'anotherValue'})\n        .then(\n          () => console.log('Stored item!'),\n          error => console.error('Error storing item', error)\n        );\n  NativeStorage.getItem('myitem')\n    .then(\n      data => console.log(data),\n      error => console.error(error)\n    );\n});\n\n``. @biesbjerg I was experiencing the same issue recently. I ran the commandionic run androidto get the results above. . @mebibou can you share with me some code that raises an exception while running inionic serve`? \nI only had this issue with functions that return Observables. Promises and sync functions seem to be working fine.. @mebibou thanks I was able to reproduce the error. I will look into it.. @mebibou Ok I found the problem here.\nSee https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/plugin.ts#L112\nWe check if the pluginRef exists before trying to call a function. Because in some cases, plugins have Web APIs ( I think only Geolocation does ... ). In this case, window.screen is the pluginRef for the ScreenOrientation plugin. The plugin adds properties to that global variables instead of creating it's own variable. So, Ionic Native thinks that the plugin has a Web API and attempts to call the function.\nI think a good solution here would be to wrap the get() function in Ionic Native with a try/catch block to catch these kind of errors.\n. @mebibou I'm unable to produce that same error with NativeStorage.getItem(). I get a warning telling me Native: tried calling NativeStorage.getItem, but Cordova is not available. Make sure to include cordova.js or run in a device/simulator..\nAlso, it's worth noting that ionic serve is not equivalent to browser platform. To run in browser platform you need to run the command ionic run browser.. @dalezak This is fixed in the master branch of ionic-cli and ionic-app-scripts. Not sure if it's published yet.. @Maziar-Fotouhi are you waiting for deviceready to fire before calling the plugin? \nIf you read my comment above, I tried using NativeStorage without any problems using latest Ionic and ionic-native versions.. Please share your code so I can test it on my end. If you can create a blank project, zip it, and send it over (without plugins and node_modules folders) that would be better.. Run npm i -g ionic@test and then run npm i --save-dev @ionic/app-scripts@nightly in your app root directory. Finally, rename main.dev.ts to main.ts (upcoming change with file structure). This should fix any livereload issues that you're having.. @mebibou sure yeah. So we can track the issue.. @farhaan008 \nMake sure to \n- use latest ionic-native version ( 2.2.16 as of this comment )\n- run on device\n- wait for deviceready event to fire. Thanks, this is added now.. Please check the plugin's issue tracker as this doesn't seem to be an issue related to Ionic Native.. I merged #888 instead since it's well documented.. @John-Luke changes look good, please see https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/821#discussion_r90491288. You can do something like import { Keyboard as Keyboard2 } from ionic-native;. @tkem \nThis issue can be fixed by upgrading your app to use Angular 4 instead of Angular 2.\nAt the moment, the official Ionic 2 app base still uses Angular 2. My guess is that they will upgrade it to Angular 4 once Ionic 3 is ready for production.\nI'm using ionic-angular@2.3.0 with Angular 4 in this demo app here and it works well: https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-playground . @tubaman could you share a code that we can use to reproduce the issue?. Are you setting the property name anywhere in your plugin wrapper?\nCan you share some code so I can have a look.. This line should be changed in your @Plugin decorator. \ntypescript\n name: 'Lyxpay',\nIt should be pluginName instead of name. Sorry that the template is outdated, will update it now.. thanks @perrygovier . Just merged it, will be available in the next release.. Our wrapper returns an Observable. That means the function will not be executed until you call .subscribe(). \nSee https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/395 for more info.. @sryze what part of the docs states that it works the same way as ngCordova?\nIonic Native is a different project and it's API doesn't follow ngCordova.. This should work:\njavascript\nvar contact = $cordovaContacts.create();\ncontact.displayName = 'John Smith';\ncontact.save().then(...);. @neojato I fixed a few things in the latest release so that might be why. Glad you got it working!. Thanks! I just pushed a commit to fix this.\nThe fix will be available in the next patch release.. It's a static class, not an Angular 2 provider. Not sure what you mean.. The method off is used to unsubscribe to a specific event that was initially listened to by using the on method. \nIn Ionic Native, we return an observable when you call the on method. To unsubscribe from the event (call the off method) you just have to unsubscribe from the observable returned.\nExample:\n```typescript\n// subscribe to event\nlet subscription = this.map.on('my event').subscribe((data) => console.log('Got data from my event', data));\n// unsubscribe from event\nsubscription.unsubscribe();\n``. Thanks! Added and will be available in next release.. What doesn't work? Can you share any errors you're getting along with steps to reproduce?. Are you wrapping your code withthis.platform.ready().then(() => { ... });?.DeviceAccounts` works fine.\nAll methods return a Promise, I just noticed your usage just console logs the returned value of the function instead of what the promise resolved.\nI can confirm that Device plugin doesn't work, I will close this issue since we have an issue open for the Device plugin #851 . This plugin doesn't have browser fallback. I suspect you might have this issue because of a current bug with livereload. Could you run it without livereload on a device or a simulator and let me know if you're still having the same issue?. @galhardi Ionicview doesn't support plugins. You need to run your app using the run command.. @skolsuper this seems like an issue with the plugin. I suggest you open an issue at their repo or check their existing issues.. Thanks, will fix this right now.. This is fixed now, please note that the static property device doesn't exist anymore on the class Device. \nFor example, Device.device.platform becomes Device.platform now.. Sorry @samarthagarwal for not updating the other issue as well. What @biesbjerg said should work.. @samarthagarwal did you update to latest version of ionic-native v2.2.11 ? . @samarthagarwal \n\n. @Math3v are you running on a device/simulator? are you using livereload?. thanks. @ksphp I'm unable to reproduce this issue.\nSeems like the encode() method isn't working at all with me (problem with the actual plugin). . Sorry I'm unable to reproduce this issue. The method trackMetric is defined.\nAre you trying to run this as soon as the app launches? If so, then it could be an issue with the Ionic Native's Angular 1 mechanism. Try waiting a few seconds before calling that function and see if it helps.. This has nothing to do with Ionic Native. This is the docs for Ionic Native Google Plus sign in: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/google-plus/. Include ionic.native.min.js in your index.html. Then you can use plugins using the global IonicNative variable. Here is a quick example:\njavascript\nIonicNative.Dialogs.alert('Hello world');. You also need to wrap your code with deviceready event listener.\n```\nfunction showDialog() {\n   IonicNative.Dialogs.alert('Hello world');\n}\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', showDialog, false);\n``. @barocsi This occurs when the options param is omitted. Just fixed it and it will be available in next patch release. For now you can just passnullor{}as a third param to work around this issue.. Are you waiting fordeviceready` event to fire? do you have the plugin installed?. @anaganisk this is an issue with the CLI/App-Scripts. It's resolved in the master branches but not released yet. You can downgrade to older version of app scripts, run the app in non-livereload. Or do the following:\nnpm i --save-dev @ionic/app-scripts@nightly \nnpm i -g ionic@test\nand rename main.dev.ts to main.ts.. @anaganisk Can you try @ionic/app-scripts@0.0.46-201612011929 .. This is the version I'm using and it works well. Not sure about the latest nightly that you got.. thanks. thanks. Fixed now, will be available in next docs update.. Thanks @cfjedimaster ... Those were the old docs (the messy ones without linebreaks). The new ones that you wanna look at are below the main docs: https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/contacts/#IContactFindOptions\nI removed the old ones and  I also updated the docs for the multiple option to note that the default value is true.. I fixed the issue in the JSDoc for now. The fixes will appear in the next docs update. \nThe docs don't get updated automatically when I push commits. But someone should update them manually soon. . @workfluo I suggest you open an issue at the plugins repo to get help with this. It doesn't look like an Ionic Native related problem to me.\nRepo url: https://github.com/akofman/cordova-plugin-dbmeter. @louisdoe not sure, I never experienced this before.\nBut that url is mentioned a few times on this page here: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-whitelist#content-security-policy. @naveedahmed1 not sure what is there to add. Looks like you just have to send additional data in the payload to display those action buttons.. Sure I can modify the interface to add the additional data. For now you can override the type by adding <any> before the variable name with the incorrect typings. \nAs for the callbacks, there's nothing I can do to help you here. The plugin can't access your Ionic 2 code externally. You need to port  your callback function to a global variable. For example:\ntypescript\nwindow['myCallback'] = () => console.log('User pressed the action button');\nthen you set the callback to myCallback. . @naveedahmed1 \nThe plugin expects something like this:\njs\n{ \"icon\": \"snooze\", \"title\": \"SNOOZE\", \"callback\": \"app.snooze\", \"foreground\": false}\nThe callback is just the name of the function and not the actual callback function. Meaning it should be something like window.app.snooze = () => console.log('snooze was clicked'). Providing the functionality you're asking for might be a little hacky and confusing for people who prefer to use the usage I mentioned in my last comment. Therefore I would rather leave it the way it is. \n. You need to use an arrow function instead of a regular function.. Looks like an issue with the plugin. Please contact them at their repo to get help.. @MELAS007 there are a few threads on the forums regarding this, did you have a look at them?\nhttps://forum.ionicframework.com/t/splashscreen-on-android-doesnt-work-only-showing-white-screen-for-2-seconds/15604/34. thanks. Yeah you're right. Thanks for pointing this out.. I removed the values from that property and added @CordovaProperty decorator, which will get the value of the constant in runtime (from the actual plugin).. I don't think it makes sense to add this documentation. If we do, then we have to add it for all the other plugins. It's a general rule that you have to wait for deviceready to fire before calling any plugins.\nWe have added some documentation to show that you have to wait for deviceready to fire. See the Examples Sections on this page: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/. @Gramatiik I would rather add a general notice on all the native docs pages to remind users that you have to wait for deviceready to fire before calling any of the plugins.. @Gramatiik waiting for deviceready should be basic knowledge for Cordova developers. \nThe usage part on each plugin is just a basic example showing how to use the plugin. It's not really meant to be Ionic 2 usage, just general usage. You have to remember that Ionic Native is not meant to be an Ionic 2 add on, it can be used with Ionic 1/2, any other framework, or just plain vanilla JS. Adding platform.ready().then(() => ...) to each doc page would be confusing for non Ionic 2 users.\nWe're working on improving the docs in a way that helps all users and explains everything, including the requirement to wait for deviceready event to fire.. thanks . @Gramatiik please see my reply here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/874#issuecomment-266920226. thanks. @fjms are you waiting for deviceready to fire before running that code?. @megharajdeepak are you using livereload? what is the error message that you're getting?. Please follow the update instructions here https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/releases/tag/v0.0.47 and then try again. This is most likely an issue with livereload (it's broken in the app-scripts version you're using).. @fjms are you using livereload? if so, read my previous comment.. @megharajdeepak \n\nAnybody knows where does ionic create this DB? Can't I give a specific location like src/app/DBs/mydb.sqlite ?\n\nIonic doesn't create the database for you, this plugin does: https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage. Can you run ionic info in your project folder.. @mebibou this would be the same issue here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/814#issuecomment-263903300\nScreenOrientation plugin uses window.screen which is defined in every browser, but the plugin specific properties are only available in Cordova environment. . @bnoeson Crosswalk fires the deviceready even before it's ready, wrap your code with setTimeout and give it ~100ms and it should work (increase the timeout if needed).. Just pushed a commit that should fix this. I wrapped the .apply call with try/catch so it can handle cases like this. The fix will be available in the next release.. @jonathan-chin I got rid of the try/catch block. I fixed this issue in another way in a different commit.\nThe issue here was caused on browser (plugin doesn't work on browser), or on the device because they were called before deviceready event fired.. I'll improve the docs soon.\nThe class you need to import is GoogleAnalytics. Methods are documented in that page.. Works fine with me, can you provide steps to reproduce.. Fresh Ionic 2 project. Latest version. (latest CLI version too). Sorry I thought you said Network is undefined, not Network.connection.\nI just pushed a commit to fix this. Please update to the latest version.\nNow you will need to use Network.type instead of Network.connection.. Yes. There are 2 static properties of the Network class that will return values right away. \nNetwork.type;\nNetwork.downlinkMax;. @nnixaa sorry I forgot to publish the release/changelog for that version, I just published it now.. Browser platform isn't ionic serve, it's ionic run browser. . What about the static property type ? You can fetch its value as soon as deviceready has fired.. It would be nice to prefix all the interfaces/enums with OS or OneSignal just to make sure that it doesn't conflict with anything in the future.\n. thanks. The following works for me:\nionic plugin add cordova-plugin-facebook4 --variable APP_ID=\"myid\" --variable APP_NAME=\"myappname\". @fredgalvao not sure, but I highly doubt that the install command is the reason.. MAP_TYPE_SATELLITE is correct, if the map type is still not changing then I'm guessing there is a problem with the plugin. . This would be an issue with Ionic Framework or the plugin itself, doesn't seem to be an Ionic Native issue.. thanks. The official docs get updated manually and they haven't been updated yet.\nThey are up to date on the staging site: http://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com/docs/v2/native/sim/. This would be an issue with the plugin and not with Ionic Native. I suggest you open an issue at their repo.. The docs are updated now.. Doesn't seem like an Ionic Native issue.. Google Maps v2 isn't going to work with our interface. We will update our wrapper once V2 is stable. If you wish to try out V2 now, you need to use their API directly.. Just pushed a commit that should fix it, will publish a release soon once I'm done reviewing other issues/PRs.. I agree the IntelliSense will look better, but overloading causes issues with the Ionic Native docs generator. Here is what the output of the docs looks like for that page:\n\nstore(dict,\u00a0key,\u00a0value,\u00a0key,\u00a0value)\n\nStores the provided value for the given key into the named dictionary.\n\n\n\nParam\nType\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\ndict\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nkey\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\nStores the provided value for the given key.\n\n\n\n\nkey\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch(dict,\u00a0key,\u00a0key)\n\nRetrieves the value for the given key from the named dictionary.\n\n\n\nParam\nType\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\ndict\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nkey\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\nRetrieves the value for the given key.\n\n\n\n\nkey\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n. thanks for pointing it out, just fixed it. The information you provided doesn't really help. Can you check the console log using Safari/Chrome? . Add a header to your request(s). The key should be Cookie and the value is the content of your cookie.. If you plan to use the cookie for all the future requests, you can call the function setHeader as follows:\nHttp.setHeader('Cookie', 'COOKIE CONTENT HERE');\nIf you only want to use it for specific requests, then you need to do the following:\nHTTP.get('https://path/to/whatever', {}, { 'Cookie': 'COOKIE_CONTENT_HERE' });. @yozman \nEvery response has 3 properties: status, data and headers. You can read the headers property and extract the sub-property Cookie from there to get the previous cookie.\nExample:\n```typescript\nHTTP.get('http://ionic.io', {}, {})\n  .then(data => {\nlet cookie = data.headers['Cookie']; // not sure if it's capitalized or not, try both\n})\n  .catch(error => {\nconsole.log(error.status);\nconsole.log(error.error); // error message as string\nconsole.log(error.headers);\n\n});\n``. You need to store it in a service in runtime, and if you wanna keep using it then you should store it in localstorage. . @yozman that's something to discuss with the plugin's developers at their repo. Also, in the future if you need support you should submit a post on the forums instead of here.. Works fine for me, make sure you're in the root directory of Ionic Native, not in the directory of your Ionic 2 app.. No, you need to clone this repository, then runnpm install` and then you can run that gulp command. You can't develop a new plugin using the compiled version of Ionic Native.. @vishuhanda001 No, I can't do that.\nTo create a custom plugin from scratch, this is the wrong place to look for instructions. Here are some instructions on how to develop a plugin: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/hybrid/plugins/\nIf you intend to create an Ionic 2 wrapper for a Cordova plugin, you need to do the following:\n```\n// Clone this repo\ngit clone https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native\n// Go to the directory\ncd ionic-native\n// install node modules\nnpm i\n```\nThen you can follow these instructions: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#creating-plugin-wrappers. Closing this issue since Ionic Native v5 includes all bug fixes/features and it supports Ionic 2.x apps.. @jepiqueau\nPerhaps there is an issue with the file paths you are using ... try console logging the values in different scenarios and find the difference. \nAnyways this is not an ionic-native issue. Looks more like a support request, I suggest you find help in the Ionic Worldwide Slack channel, or the official Ionic Forums.. This is an issue with the plugin and not with ionic native.. Thanks. @amargarido seems like an issue with the plugin. Can't see how Ionic Native could be causing trouble here.\nIs this.selectedItem.videoId outputting a valid string? Does the error message thrown by openVideo contain any additional information?\nError 400 seems like an HTTP error happening while the plugin communicates with YouTube.. Just pushed a commit to fix this, will be available in the next release.. Does it work if you call cordova.plugins.Keyboard.close(); instead ?. You need to add declare var cordova:any; at the top of the page.. I think this is an issue with Ionic Framework.\nUsing the console to show the keyboard works, but when I do it from within the app it doesn't work. I'm having the opposite issue though, close works but show doesn't work.. What platform are you testing on?\nAre you getting any errors?\nIs the promise resolving or rejecting? Or are you not getting any response at all?. @DILEEP-YADAV here is an example on how to find contacts:\nhttps://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-playground/blob/master/src/pages/contacts/contacts.ts#L35-L46. You need to run ionic run browser or ionic build browser to get the browser support. . I think the Base64 works for images only, not videos. Even if it did work for videos, it would be a bad idea to do that.. Converting data to a Base64 string is memory intensive.. Thanks I just fixed it, will be available in the next release.. thanks @KevinBeckers . To run the browser platform you need to run ionic run browser. The serve command opens your app as a website, not as a cordova platform.. @AmitMY I agree, the Cordova browser platform is poorly documented compared to the other platforms. It should be documented in the Cordova docs.. Thanks just pushed a commit to fix this. Will be available in the next docs update.. I just tried the plugin and it worked fine on Android 7.1.x.\nhttps://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-playground/blob/master/src/pages/market/market.ts#L18. Thanks @stormwin . Closing in favor of #921.. @ivanovvitaly \nCan you try to modify your index.html and make sure that cordova.js is included AFTER polyfills.js ?. @ivanovvitaly I just realized  the plugin returns back a promise, see https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-screen-orientation/blob/master/www/screenorientation.js#L71-L83\nI will do the necessary changes to the ionic-native code to work with that.. Are you using the latest version of Ionic native?. @AmitMY sometimes it doesn't update in real-time. Try sending a trackView request after the tracker is initialized, then go to your google analytics page and view the real-time data.... @AmitMY are you only having trouble with the browser platform? or is it happening with all platforms?. What are the errors that you're getting?\nCan you share the stack trace along with your code.. That's the error thrown by the plugin here: https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin/blob/13041422f6fd43c846677b87fcb722310ba7ab03/browser/UniversalAnalyticsProxy.js#L170\nAt least that narrows down the issue to be plugin related. Also it might be worth double checking that your browser isn't blocking any connections (any extensions that block trackers).. The error you are getting in the console is because your app isn't configured properly in the Facebook Developers page.\nThis behavior is caused by the plugin and not by Ionic Native. If you feel that the promise should be rejected (the error callback should be called) when that happens, I suggest you open an issue with the developers: https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4. I remember we had an issue with Observables that led us to do that. They stop emitting after a single error, which causes the watch functionality to break.. Thanks @mestremuten just updated it. thanks @tkem . thanks @uPaymeiFixit . thanks. The tslint is failing, there is an issue at line 84 of contacts.ts. Pull latest version of the repo, seems like it's building fine according to CircleCI.. @biesbjerg works fine with me. Running node 7.4.0 and Typescript 2.0.10.. @biesbjerg \n~~no, i'll try that in a bit.~~\nYeah if I do a clean clone I can reproduce the issue. I will modify package.json now to fix this.. thanks for pointing this out @biesbjerg, just fixed it!. @biesbjerg that's normal, Angular 2 lets you know if you didn't handle promise rejections. The promise does reject when you're running on serve. \nBtw, how is this plugin different than the App Rate plugin?. @biesbjerg ok sounds good. I will merge this for the next non-patch release.. @biesbjerg yeah I did a mistake a few days ago, it returns that console log when there is an uncaught exception. In v2.2.16 it's fully fixed and it should only show  that message when the plugin isn't installed/available.. I'm unable to reproduce this issue. Using Ionic Native v2.4.0 and Ionic Framework 2 RC5.. @LeVadim I need steps to reproduce this issue and/or more information about the error. The information provided isn't enough to qualify as a bug.. @mhhansen the plugin wont work on ionic serve. You have to run it on Android or iOS device/simulator.. @mhhansen does the element have a defined height CSS property? do you see Google's logo at all or just a blank screen?. Since ionic-native  v2.2.12 it's Network.type instead of Network.connection. See change log here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/releases/tag/v2.2.12. @NoNameProvided yes, you do need to wait for platform.ready() before doing anything. . Already have a PR for it here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/425. That's happening because you're running on ionic serve and the cordova platform isn't available there. Ionic Native returns {} when a property doesn't exist (when cordova isn't available), and it also throws a console warning to let the developer know. See https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/plugin.ts#L433.\nI should probably change that and make it return null.. This is fixed already, just not published on the production site yet. See here: http://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com/docs/v2/native/network/#advanced\nThanks though!. @YasirPanjsheri maybe your local cache is out of date. \nRun npm rm --save ionic native then npm install --save ionic-native@latest to make sure you have the latest version.. @jguix try wrapping your code with this.platform.ready().then(() => { ... });. The docs say to install cordova-plugin-videoplayer. That package on NPM does not match the plugin.\nPlease uninstall the plugin and then install it directly from the repo \nionic plugin rm cordova-plugin-videoplayer\nionic plugin add https://github.com/moust/cordova-plugin-videoplayer. @tycho01 we'll work on removing the () from properties.. Are you waiting for deviceready to fire by wrapping your code with this.platform.ready().then(() => { ... }) ?. What device are you testing on? I will try to reproduce the issue.. @HamzaLJ by browser you mean ionic run browser or ionic serve ? \nYour code should work fine on a real device, but it wouldn't work on ionic serve.. @HamzaLJ ionic serve doesn't include the Cordova platforms and plugins. Therefore, when Ionic Native tries to process Push.init it results in a null value since the plugin scripts aren't available. \nThis is the case for all plugins and not just the Push plugin. If you are trying to test out browser functionality of a plugin you need to run ionic run browser (make sure you have browser platform installed as well). . This is fixed in latest 3.x. @vahidvdn this issue has nothing to do with Ionic Cloud. Yes sure a PR would be nice. Thanks!. thanks @abennouna !. You're getting this error because for some reason window.angular is defined. That variable shouldn't be defined in Ionic 2 AFAIK. \nAre you using the ng-upgrade (not sure of the name) module? Can you reproduce this same issue with a fresh project?\nIf this is a real issue then I can modify plugin.ts to check that window.angular.element exists and not just window.angular.. Upgrade to 2.2.16. Just following what's here: https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/wiki/Map#create-a-map. Sorry about that. Just fixed it. \nWill be available in the next patch release.. @waynebloss can you try the fix mentioned here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/505#issuecomment-273504996\nMight be related...\n. Please read the breaking changes section here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/releases/tag/v2.2.12. Please read the breaking changes section here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/releases/tag/v2.2.12. Modify your index.html. Make sure cordova.js is loaded after polyfill.js\n. thanks. Sorry for the misleading message. I will get rid of it.\nTry this:\nvar ref = new $cordovaInAppBrowser('https://google.com');. It doesn't have to be 100%. It just needs any height value since the div default height is 0. . Sorry, I didn't notice that extra line of instructions. Looks good.. thanks. @wshaheer this might be because I changed the rxjs version in the latest release. Does it work perfectly in 2.2.14? In your app's package.json, what is the rxjs version defined there?. How come you have 5.0.3? both Ionic and Ionic Native use 5.0.0-beta.12. . @wshaheer you should stick to that the fresh project provides you with. @ankitjainOfficial the plugin is not injectable, it's a static object. Remove it from your constructor.\nThe correct usage is:\n```\nimport { HTTP } from 'ionic-native';\nHTTP.post(....);\n```. We have a PR here that should address some of these issues. I will try to enhance it further to cover all the points you mentioned.\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/425. This plugin was added awhile ago. Sorry I forgot to update this issue.. Will resubmit for v3 if needed. Thanks. I'll merge this for now for the sake of covering all the plugin's functionality. But in the future it would be nice to have a base class that all the other classes extend. I still need to do some experimenting to see how this would work with the decorators we have.. thanks. thanks. Thanks. Fixed in 2.4.0. Thanks for pointing it out.. Closing this issue since this is not a question for Ionic Native. This would be something to discuss in the forums.\nHere's what I think:\nI think this can work by creating a second app (doesn't have to be a full ionic 2 app, it can be a small single page that only takes care of the streaming). Place that app in a directory other than your app's root directory. Then start an Httpd server in that directory and open it using InAppBrowser plugin. You can then communicate with the page using events or by manipulating the URL (hash urls). \nThe second option is to modify the Cordova platform, use a native library to host your app over HTTP, then open it using WebView instead of the file:/// url. \n\nIf you need further help, please open a thread at the forums: https://forum.ionicframework.com/\nGood luck!. Try adding @latest when installing. Example:\nionic plugin add cordova-plugin-screen-orientation@latest. @TomDemulierChevret thanks for pointing that out.\nI will probably revert the change and make our wrapper work with the npm package since that's what everybody has installed. Then I will publish this as a breaking change in ionic-native@3.0.0.. @RafaelKr the old developer needs to give apache the permission to publish the plugin on npm.. @betollaque remove | FileTransferError from there and it will work.. Use https://github.com/Slidee/cordova-plugin-stepcounter instead.. I'm assuming this is resolved/answered. Closing.. That error message is thrown by the plugin here: https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller/blob/master/src/android/ChromeCustomTabPlugin.java#L100\nNot sure how this is related to Ionic Native. I suggest you open an issue with the plugin developer to get some help : https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller/issues. This is an issue with the plugin. See https://github.com/arnesson/cordova-plugin-firebase/issues/129. Sorry, please resubmit as two separate PRs.. Are you running on a simulator or a real device?. The on method returns back an Observable. So you are supposed to call .subscribe instead of passing a callback.\nHere's an example: (not a 100% sure since I don't use Ionic 1 anymore personally)\n```javascript\nvar browser = new $cordovaInAppBrowser('https://*/authorize?client_id=*&display=page&redirect_uri=https://*/blank.html&scope=friends,wall,offline,photos&response_type=token&v=5.52', '_self');\nbrowser.on('loadstop').subscribe(function(event){ \n// do stuff here\n});\n```. @joshstrange we're taking a little break from adding new plugins. I will merge this once we're done with finalizing the v3 release. . This issue is caused by the way the plugin is built. We have no control over it at Ionic Native. \nI suggest you open an issue with them: https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20status%20in%20%28Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened%29%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22Plugin%20InAppBrowser%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20summary%20ASC%2C%20updatedDate%20DESC. @dipolediamond please update to latest version of ionic-native.. Closing this issue in favor of #1500.. @monalisasaha79 I'm sorry, I don't understand what the issue is here. \nCould you please create a fresh project, adding only the necessary code to demonstrate this issue? and I will gladly have a look at it.. @monalisasaha79 in your code here:\npublic captureImageFromCamera(){\n    Camera.getPicture ({\n      sourceType: 1,\n      quality: 100,\n      correctOrientation: true,\n      mediaType: 0,\n      encodingType: 0\n    })\n    .then((data) =>{\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        console.log (data);\n        this.imageUpdate(data, 0);\n      }, 0);\n    }, (err) => {\n      console.log (\"Do nothing\");\n    });\n  }\nIs the promise resolving at all? is data defined and does it contain the expected values?\nIf the answer is yes to these questions, then both the plugin and ionic-native are functioning properly. It would be an issue with Ionic Framework or could just be a problem with your code.\nIt's hard to tell where the issue is with the code that you provided, I don't see a connection between the promises resolving and the popover being opened. I really recommend that you create a minimal project with only the code necessary to reproduce this issue, and then share this code on the forums to get some help with it.. @monalisasaha79 glad you got it working!. I recommend you look into https://github.com/ocombe/ng2-translate. You can see how it's used here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-super. Just had a look at the plugin. It looks like there aren't any methods that we need to wrap. Looks like everything is configured using the json  files.. @AmitMY \nThis isn't an Ionic Native issue.\nYou should see the available preferences here https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/#preferences\nI think you need to add AutoHideSplashScreen and set it to false.\n. This is not an Ionic Native issue. \nI suggest you open an issue with at the plugin's repo or the post it on the Ionic Framework forums.. Should be fixed in latest release. The localstorage fallback is for the Cordova Browser platform. When you run ionic serve it just launches your app code as a website, not as a Cordova platform. Therefore, cordova.js and any plugin javascript code isn't included in there.\nTo test out the functionality you're talking about, you need to run ionic run browser.. @anivaisu please see https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/releases/tag/v2.2.12\nYou should be calling Network.type instead of Network.connection. . @jsayol yeah you're right that plugin has everything. I don't think this is needed.. Will resubmit for v3. Are you wrapping you code with this.platform.ready() ?. @anivaisu what platform(s) are you getting this error message on? I will try to reproduce the issue on my end.. ionic serve runs your app as a website in the browser. It doesn't include any of the cordova platform files. The plugin isn't supposed to work there. You need to run your app on a device or a simulator.. Duplicate of #1034. @John-Luke have you tried Ionic Native v3?. In every case both successIndex and errorIndex are defined even if we don't need one of them. I think pinDialog is the only one that's missing errorIndex, we can set it to a number higher than the number of arguments so it's not used.\nUpdate: just pushed a commit and added errorIndex to pinDialog. \nUpdate 2: I'll keep this open, maybe we'll merge it later. But most likely we're getting rid of all decorators, see https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/1038.. Yes, you're right. \nThis is just a rare case, PinDialog and CodePush are the only plugins that have methods like this. See https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/6ba1d4908b36d644a1de2b3bd677842ab4cb6241/src/plugins/code-push.ts#L514\nI just fixed PinDialog and added errorIndex that's higher than the number of arguments so it's added all the way at the end. So the signature would look like:\nprompt(message, resultCallback, title, buttonLabels, errorHandler)\nNow it's just an extra argument that the plugin will not use. \nIt's a rare case (only 2 occurrences as of now). So, there's no need to add these lines of code to plugin.ts and process them for every method that has successIndex and errorIndex. . Thanks for reporting this. I will look into it. For now ionic-native@2.4.1 should be fine and it supports Network.type. . Both build and serve working fine with latest version of ionic-native. \nCould you please provide steps to reproduce this issue? or maybe an example project.. @Isigiel I managed to get the same error with your project and also by creating a fresh project. I will debug and find out the cause. \n~It's strange because I have an app here https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-image-loader-example that I recently upgraded to 2.0.0 and it works well. The repo is at ionic-native@2.4.1 but I tested with 2.5.0.~\n~Update: cloning my repo and installing/building from just the source code reproduces the issue as well.~. @Isigiel ok I figured it out. It was a mistake I did when building ionic-native before releasing 2.5.0. Not sure what it was but I fixed it and it works well now. Please update to ionic-native@2.5.1.\nI apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused you.. This is a bug with ionic-native. I will fix it as soon as I get a chance.\nFor now, you can do one of the following:\n\n\nUse onConnect() and onDisconnect() methods.\n\n\nBefore you call Network.onchange() execute the following code:\ntypescript\nnavigator.connection.onchange = 'any truthy value';\nYou will also need to put this at the top of your code to make solution # 2 work:\ntypescript\ndeclare var navigator: any;. Thanks for reporting this. I will fix it soon.\n\n\nThe create option doesn't even do anything. It should just have replace: true.\nThe only options that matter are append, replace and truncate. See https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/file.ts#L682-L683 and https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/file.ts#L710\n. @ghenry22 please update to ionic-native@2.7.0. This is fixed now. Please update to latest version 3.0.0. . Already have a PR here https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/1048\nWaiting on @mlynch to review, just in case he's planning to bump the framework's rxjs.. We'll look into it. \nFor now, if you need to use it with Ionic 2, you can do the following:\n\n\nAdd this line at the top of every page where you wish to use the plugin to get rid of IDE errors:\ndeclare var bluetoothle: any;\n\n\nUse the plugin as instructed by their documentation, you will have to use callback functions since that's how their plugin works. . Currently, the package names match the directory names here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/tree/v3/src/%40ionic-native/plugins\n\n\nSo the Barcode Scanner plugin's package name is @ionic-native/barcodescanner.. This is added now and available in latest version.. We plan on fixing this for the next release. . As far as I know, the InAppBrowser expects features/options to be a comma separated during. Passing an object might not work.. Here's a project using @ionic-native/geolocation with no issues. Feel free to fork the repo and reproduce any issues you're having, and I'll be happy to take a look.\nhttps://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-geolocation-test. @wundo \nTry using simple event listeners as follows:\n```typescript\ndocument.addEventListener(\"offline\", yourCallbackFunction, false);\ndocument.addEventListener(\"online\", yourCallbackFunction, false);\n```\n. I just tested this out using the latest version of plugin + ionic native, can't reproduce the issue.. You need to import from @ionic-native/*\nFor example:\n```typescript\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\n``. @mburger81 can you please share a minimal project demonstrating this issue? A Github repo link would be nice.. Docs are updated now.. @cambronjaycordova.file.dataDirectory` is a string, it's not an object.\nAll plugins need to be used after device is ready. You can inject Platform in any component/service and then call this.platform.ready().then(() => { // call plugin here }. @gfringeli you can use Globalization plugin to fetch the device's language. Then set the options for SocialSharing.shareWithOptions/SocialSharing.share accordingly. \nYou can also fetch strings defined in ng2-translate and use them there.. I just merged a PR to revert our API to support version 1.4.1 of the plugin.\nOnce v2.0.0 of cordova-plugin-screen-orientation is stable, I will update our API to support it.\nI will keep this issue open for tracking.. @matejamateusz \n~~the current latest version of ionic-native supports version 1.4.1 of the plugin. We will edit our wrapper to support 2.0.0 when it's stable.~~\nSorry just realized they published 2.0.0 two days ago. I will fix this soon.. Sorry I forgot to update this issue.\nThe latest version of Ionic Native 3.x supports the latest version of this plugin now.,. What version of Ionic Native are you using?. @wundo please update to 2.2.12 at least. \nThe latest stable version is 2.7.0.. @wundo \nThe property type is defined right here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/network.ts#L59\nIn run-time Ionic Native will call pluginRef + property name to get you the value. So it will be getting the value from navigator.connection.type. That matches what they have in their docs here: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-network-information#properties\nI don't see where the problem is, I tested this not too long ago. \nTry the following:\nnpm rm --save ionic-native\nnpm i --save ionic-native@latest. @chenlitchian https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/v2.x/src/plugins/network.ts#L59. Closing since this is a plugin issue.. @NoNameProvided sure\nDoes this describe the \"quirk\" well:\n\nYou must wait for getTags to resolve before calling it again, as the plugin will only process the last method call and discard any previous ones.. Thanks @NoNameProvided just pushed a commit for that. It will be live in the next doc update.. @viskin I personally prefer not using overloads.\n\nHaving overloads requires changing the doc generating process. We would need to ask @perrygovier to have a look and see if it's do-able.. Can you share your code here?\nAlso it's worth noting that you should use arrow functions for these callbacks, and not regular functions. The moment you write function() { } you're basically creating a new scope, and when you call this it will refer to the function and not the class that it's in.. If you've made major changes that will fix issues for everyone, you can share more details so we can review them. Then we could change our documentation to instruct developers to install the plugin from your repo/npm instead.. This issue was moved to driftyco/ionic#10612. @bionicbrad Upgrade to 2.8.0 and let me know if you're experiencing issues.. @Scuttman BackgroundGeolocation.configure now returns an observable and doesn't take callback parameters.. Fixed and will be available in the next release.. @FarhanSaleem copy ionic.native.min.js to your some folder inside www. For example: lib/ionic.native.min.js. \nWhen you serve you app from www directory, it is unable to access anything outside of there.. This was discussed in a previous issue. The solution they came up with is to place the cordova.js script AFTER polyfills.js. This will load Zone.js before the plugin and fix the issue.. This should've been two separate PRs.\nThanks though\nUpdate: also, the default comments from the template should be removed. @vegardlarsen the build was failing because lines like this one  https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/file.ts#L489 were returning Promie<FileError>. \nI ended up implementing the changes in #1086 again, but I changed Promise<FileError> to Promise<any> so that the TypeScript compiler doesn't throw any errors. So basically your fix is currently implemented.. You mean device model?\n```\nimport {Device} from 'ionic-native';\nconsole.log(Device.model);\n```. @jasdf2351 I don't see any API changes in that PR that we have to implement. \nYou can just update the installed version of Google Analytics to latest version and it should work fine with our wrapper.. Nothing is built into Ionic Native. You just need to uninstall the plugin you currently have and re-install it. Or just run the install command with @latest tag. ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-someplugin@latest. What version are you installing?. Since v3.1.0 all plugins are injectable, there are no more static methods.\nIf you want to use v3 and stay with static methods for now, please install 3.0.x.\nHere is how you use 3.1.0-alpha:\nFirst, make sure you have @ionic-native/core and the plugins you need installed at version 3.1.0-alpha.3. You can do that by running these commands:\nshell\nnpm i --save @ionic-native/core@alpha\nnpm i --save @ionic-native/google-analytics@alpha\nThen import the plugin in your app's module:\ntypescript\nimport { GoogleAnalytics } from '@ionic-native/google-analytics';\n@NgModule({\n...\n  providers: [ GoogleAnalytics ]\n...\n})\nFinally, inject it in any component or service to use it:\n```typescript\nconstructor(private ga: GoogleAnalytics) { }\ninitGA(){ \n  this.ga.startTrackerWithId(....);\n}\ntrackSomething() {\n  this.ga.trackView(...)\n}\n```. @Sh1d0w please read my comment here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/1134#issuecomment-283669578\nIf you don't wish to use the injectable plugins, stick with @ionic-native/*@3.0.0. Also, avoid 3.1.0.alpha.1 and 3.0.0.alpha.2 as they contained experimental changes. . The method returns back a promise that substitutes the callbacks. There was a mistake in the typings where it says it returns void but it actually returns a Promise. I just fixed that here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/27fdce7af2cdb7c0cc6b904a4cd832e8315c5ddd\nFix will be available in the next release.. I will try to reproduce this.. Please update to 2.8.0. ionic serve runs your app as a website, so any Cordova platform related stuff wont be available there.. This is not an Ionic Native question.  But I'll answer it:\nCordova CLI stores the plugin data in config.xml. Ionic stores them in package.json.\nI'm not quite sure how Ionic CLI works but I think when you run ionic state save, it will save your plugins to package.json. Then you can run ionic state reset or ionic state restore to restore the plugins defined in package.json. \nCordova CLI stores everything in config.xml. You can run cordova prepare to restore plugins and platforms. So basically cordova prepare is somewhat equivalent to ionic state restore. \nTo update your plugins, you can run a command like:\ncordova plugin install cordova-plugin-camera@latest --save\nYou can do the same with Ionic CLI:\nionic plugin install cordova-plugin-camera@latest --save\nRead http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/platform_plugin_versioning_ref/index.html for more information.\n. @sagivf yeah this matter would be an Ionic CLI issue. \nHere's a trick to lock down versions in package.json:\nInstead of:\n\"cordovaPlugins\": [\n  \"cordova-plugin-camera\"\n]\nYou can have:\n\"cordovaPlugins\": [\n  {\n    \"id\": \"cordova-plugin-camera\",\n    \"locator\": \"cordova-plugin-camera@1.3.0\"\n  }\n]. This doesn't seem like an issue with the Ionic Native wrapper.\nIonic Native is just a wrapper and it has no effect on how the plugin performs. Please seek help at the plugin's repo or at the Ionic Forums.. Just pushed a commit to fix this.\nEffects will show in the next v3 release.. @chrisbenseler the plugin doesn't have browser support: https://github.com/sarriaroman/photoviewer\nWith Ionic Native 3.1.x (3.1.0-rc.1 is the latest currently) you can override the PhotoViewer provider in your NgModule. In your custom provider you can use a JavaScript based library to open images. \nAlso, have a look at this directive here: https://github.com/Riron/ionic-img-viewer/. Please use NPM instead. Ionic Native 2.x releases are not going to be updated often anyways so it shouldn't be a big inconvenience to copy & paste the files.. This is an issue with the plugin. Please report it here: https://github.com/hypery2k/cordova-email-plugin. What platform are you testing this on?. We'll update the rxjs version here soon. ~It should be safe to ignore the ionic-native peer dependency warning and use rxjs@5.0.1~. Just published ionic-native@2.8.1 that solves this issue.. @peterpeterparker working on it, there's another issue that's open for that.\n. @peterpeterparker see https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/1156#issuecomment-285710175. ~It's safe to ignore these warnings and just install rxjs@5.0.1 that comes with the ionic framework.~. Just fixed this and published @ionic-native/*@3.1.0-rc.2.. @Sh1d0w ahh sorry, forgot to upgrade Angular.. @Sh1d0w just published 3.1.0-rc.3.. @rapropos I'll look into it. This would be a question to address at the plugin's repo. I don't think it's possible with this plugin though.. Just updated the PhotoViewer plugin along with many others.\nI'll make sure all plugins have the platforms documented when I get some time. \nFeel free to submit pull requests to improve any plugin's documentation!. Closing this issue in favor of https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/810. We will review this once v2 is stable. \nIf you could submit a PR for the v3-injectable branch that would be better.. @John-Luke waiting for v2.0 to be stable.. I think it's best to wait for v2 to be stable before updating the wrapper. \nOnce it's stable, we can review this PR and https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/1424 and update the most complete one to the plugins final API then merge it.. Seems like an issue with the plugin and not Ionic Native. I see a few related issues there.\nTry throwing a console log inside your .then block to see if the callback is being called at all or it's crashing before that.. This plugin already exists in the latest version of Ionic Native. Just not documented yet on the Ionic Framework's site.\nSee https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/health.ts. In addition to what @ehorodyski said:\nWhen you use the _system target, you have no control over what you want the browser window to look like. _system opens it in an app of the user's choice. You need to use _blank to open it in an InAppBrowser instance that you can customize.. @omgalbert \nNone of the In App Browser plugins we have will open a URL inside of your current WebView. \nTo achieve that kind of functionality, you will need to use an iframe.. Not sure why you're not getting the toolbar with the Done button. Can't see anything wrong with the Ionic Native wrapper.\nI will test this out when I get a chance.\nIn the meanwhile, may I suggest using the BrowserTab plugin: https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/browser-tab/. Sorry forgot to update this issue. The signature has been updated, just make sure to install the plugin from the repo.. This plugin was added in ionic-native@2.6.0. Please make sure you have that version or a later version installed.. thanks. Try using this fork: https://github.com/Switch168/cordova-HTTP. Works best for me.. Thanks for pointing this out.\nJust pushed a commit to fix this.\nPlease update to @ionic-native/*3.1.0-rc.5. Updating the core package should fix this, but you can update all the packages if you want.. The browserInit method is deprecated now and you don't need to call it anymore.\nThe plugin will automatically init the Facebook SDK when you launch the app in Cordova Browser platform. . Closing this issue since Ionic Native v5 includes all bug fixes/features and it supports Ionic 2.x apps.. You're probably testing with different version of the plugin.\ncordova-plugin-screen-orientation version 2.0.0 was release two days ago and they made major changes to their API. \nThe results you're getting on Android sound like 2.0.0 and iOS is 1.4.0.\nIonic Native currently supports 1.4.0. I'm going to update the API soon to support 2.0.0.. Sorry then I don't know what the problem is.\nI suggest you wait for the next Ionic Native update and use version 2.0.0 which should be consistent.. @Sh1d0w please use latest @ionic-native/* version 3.1.0-rc.6. Yes add it from git. What is the code that you used before?. Oh ok. It returns back a promise now.\nI should change that and return an observable instead, since the callback will be called multiple times.. Fixed by https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/961cff1 and published as 2.9.0. They are now @ionic-native/status-bar and @ionic-native/splash-screen. This method was added in 2.7.0 and should be available. Are you getting the error from the compiler or the IDE? \nIf it's the IDE, maybe its indexes aren't updated properly.. It's not supposed to work on browser platform. The Geocoder class is part of the google maps plugin, which only supports Android and iOS platforms.\nThe other plugin we have is NativeGeocoder, which also only supports iOS/Android.\nIf you use Ionic Native v3 you will be able to override the class provider and write your own browser functionality for it.. @jadsalhani it's mentioned here: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/#Add_Plugins_to_Your_App_Module. @jadsalhani See https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/issues/825. @Mystearica \nIn app.module.ts: \n```typescript\nimport { Transfer } from '@ionic-native/transfer'; // import Transfer class\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [ ... , Transfer ], // add Transfer to imports\n  ...\n})\n```\nIn your component or service:\n```typescript\nimport { Transfer } from '@ionic-native/transfer';\nconstructor(private transfer: Transfer) { }\nsomeMethod() { \nconst fileTransfer = this.transfer.create();\n  fileTransfer.download(...);\n}\n``. @Mystearica the methodthis.transfer.createreturns an instance ofTransferObject`. @HimanshuHD \nCan you share you code?\nAs of  Ionic Native 3.1+, all plugin providers need to be imported in order for them to work. . @HimanshuHD \nYou are following Ionic Native 3.x usage and using Ionic Native 2.x. Please follow the documentation here  and here to get started with 3.x. \nIf you want to keep using Ionic Native 2.x, you can find the documentation here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/v2.x/src/plugins/filetransfer.ts#L116-L183. Yes. Sorry, we haven't updated DEVELOPER.md for Ionic Native 3.x yet.. Just had a look at the commit you referenced. The new text is partially correct.\nAccording to the current process:\n- you need to copy /dist/packages-dist/@ionic-native/core/ to YOUR_APP/node_modules/@ionic-native/core/\n- then copy any plugins that you are using from /dist/packages-dist/@ionic-native/plugins/ to YOUR_APP/node_modules/@ionic-native/\nI think this need to be changed though. It would make more sense to get rid of both packages-dist and plugins folders, so the dist/@ionic-native/ directory will match the /node_modules/@ionic-native/ directory.. Thanks for submitting a PR. \nPlease review the changes requested.\nAlso, please run npm run lint or gulp lint to review and fix any code style issues.. Hey @lorkel ,\nI'm guessing you just created a new project. New projects now come with Ionic Native 3.x pre-installed. Looks like you have Ionic Native 3.1.1 pre-installed and you are trying to install Ionic Native 2.x.\nPlease read the updated documentation for instructions on using Ionic Native 3.x: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/\nIf you wish to use Ionic Native 2.x, then uninstall any packages that begin with @ionic-native/ and only keep ionic-native.. @lorkel \nFrom what I see, you have @ionic-native/core@3.1.0 installed and you're trying to install version 3.1.1 of the plugins. You need to make sure that you have the same version of core and the plugins to get rid of these warnings.\nThis will be fixed in the next release in a way that you don't have to update @ionic-native/core unless if you need to.. @lorkel Just published 3.2.0 that solves this issue. You will no longer get these error messages unless the core package needs to be updated.. What I meant is your plugins have to be at least 3.2.0 so you don't experience these errors again, unless  it's necessary.\nJust run:\nnpm i --save @ionic-native/core @ionic-native/camera@latest @ionic-native/splash-screen@latest @ionic-native/status-bar@latest\n. Thanks, will fix soon.\n. You can visit the plugin repositories to see examples, or you can check out this personal project here to see lots of plugins in action: https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-playground\n. These two plugins are not the same. We can't just simply change the repo and package ID. We will need to re-write the wrapper, or add a new one for the other plugin.\nWe have an issue for this here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/810. ionic-native package is 2.x. We no longer use it in Ionic Native 3.x.\nYou need to install @ionic-native/core and @ionic-native/device then import Device from @ionic-native/device.. Your class should look like this instead:\n```ts\nexport class DeviceExt extends Device {\nuuid: 'someUUID';\n// or\n   get uuid(): string { \n    return 'some-uuid';\n   }\n}\n```\nWhen you are doing this:\nts\nthis.uuid = 'some value';\nIt's basically calling the set function for the original property on the Device class. That set function is designed to set the real value that is outputted by the plugin itself. This means what you still need to be running on a Cordova platform for it to work.. The SQLite plugin maintainer has responded to you here: https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/651. This issue was moved to driftyco/ionic-plugin-keyboard#257. Minor issue with the plugin, has nothing to do with Ionic Native. Plugin\njust needs to run in a background thread.\nOn Jan 25, 2018 9:37 PM, \"Huxiaodan120808\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI have the same problem, how to solve it? thanks\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/issues/1225#issuecomment-360667535,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANJ8dFrH9uKZsKrs6uVgp8oqtZ4GP9uRks5tOTpkgaJpZM4Mlvoz\n.\n. Nope. If you read above, I moved the issue to another repo. Because it's not a problem with Ionic Native. You can ask your questions over there.\n\nAnyways, this isn't really an issue. It's just a console warning telling you that your app can be further optimized. . Please follow the instructions here: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/#Add_Plugins_to_Your_App_Module\nYou need to add the provider to your NgModule. The packages are re-named. They are now google-analytics, in-app-browser, splash-screen and status-bar.\nAlso worth noting that since Ionic Native 3.1.x, all packages export injectable providers instead of static classes. Please refer to the official Ionic Native docs for more information.. As @Screeze said, ionic-native package is 2.x and anything under the @ionic-native/* scope is 3.x. It's fixed now. Thanks for reporting the issue.. The constants are still instance members, they're not static.. The documentation is for Ionic Native 3.x. I'm guessing you're still using 2.x which uses the ionic-native package.. You need to inject ScreenOrientation and then call this.screenOrientation.lockOrientation(...).\nPlease refer to the latest Ionic Native documentation for instructions on how to use Ionic Native 3.x. This should work\n$ npm install --save @ionic-native/screen-orientation. This is fixed now. According to the docs here http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/in-app-browser/#executeScript it returns a Promise. \nThe promise replaces the callbacks.. ```ts\nconstructor(private iab: InAppBrowser) { }\nsomeMethod() { \nconst browser = this.iab.create('https://google.com');\nconst sub = browser.on('load').subscribe(() => {\n  browser.executeScript({ code: 'console.log(\"hello world\")' })\n  .then(() => console.log('Executed script!'))\n  .catch(e => console.log('error executing script'));\n  sub.unsubscribe();\n});\n}\n``. @daveshirman it does say that here https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/#Add_Plugins_to_Your_App_Module. @daveshirman that is also documented in the Usage section here: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/camera/. Thanks @daveshirman we'll work on improving the docs further. Any suggestions are  welcome.. @peterpeterparker when you build your app with--prodflag, is the output file size still bigger than it would've been with Ionic Native 2.x ?. @peterpeterparker that source map is showing you how big the source file is (node_modules/@ionic-native/....`). \nWhen you build your app with the --prod flag it will uglify and treeshake the code and it ends up being much smaller than that.. @peterpeterparker I'm not aware of any way to check that. \nNot sure what you mean by the second part of your comment. Could you please elaborate?. @peterpeterparker oh I see what you mean.\nAFAIK, tree shaking doesn't work so well with decorators. We use lots of decorators in Ionic Native and it causes the tree shaking processor to think that we actually need all the functions to be there. This is one of the reasons why we split the plugins into their own packages. \nWe will definitely look into more ways to reduce the bundle size in the future. Rollup might improve, or we might find more ways to make our code to work better with Rollup. . Could you please provide a link to the repo of this plugin?. Only the ionic-native package will provide that, which is 2.x. It will only be maintained to fix bugs and will not have any new plugins added to it.\nStarting from Ionic Native 3.x it's going to support Angular 2.x+ apps only.. I'm using the Camera Preview plugin here without any problems: https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-playground/blob/master/src/pages/camera-preview/camera-preview.ts\nMake sure you have the right plugin installed. I also recommend installing the plugin from the repo instead of NPM, as they haven't updated their NPM package yet.\nionic plugin rm --save cordova-plugin-camera-preview\nionic plugin add --save https://github.com/cordova-plugin-camera-preview/cordova-plugin-camera-preview. @SVANNER \nionic platform rm browser\nionic platform add browser. @Vito96 Geocoder class is exported by the @ionic-native/google-maps package. It's injectable and has one instance method geocode.. thanks @ZiFFeL1992 !. Did you add SplashScreen and other plugin providers to your @NgModule ?. This issue was moved to driftyco/ionic-starter-super#86. Thanks @tkem \nI also updated the templates for plugin:create command. Thanks for pointing that stuff out :) . @ehorodyski just pushed a commit to the master branch to fix this issue.. You have to inject Transfer as a provider. Then inject it in any service/component and call this.transfer.create() instead of new Transfer. . Its renamed to @ionic-native/splash-screen. Update your ionic-native package to the latest version. \nnpm I --save ionic-native@latest. Thanks @ratson, I think that's a good idea. Similar to what the ng-cordova repo has: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova#plugins-67. Is @ionic-native/core installed?\nWhat versions are you using?. Try updating @ionic/app-scripts.\nI can't reproduce this issue with the latest version of Ionic 2.. Can you also upgrade @ionic-native/core to 3.3.0 or downgrade to 3.2.3. Version 3.24 has a bug, not sure if it's causing this issue but it's worth a try.. What is the last thing you see in the command prompt before it freezes? . Not sure what the problem is here, but here are a few things to try to narrow the issue down:\n- npm run build --prod instead of ionic build\n- rm -rf node_modules && npm install to re-install your node modules in case something is messed up there\n. Fixed in 3.3.0.. @RafaelKr  Update @ionic-native/contacts to latest version as well.. @RafaelKr I can't tell what's wrong with it without seeing the source code.\nMake sure your @Plugin decorator is there and has at least the following properties in it's config: pluginName, plugin, and pluginRef.. @RafaelKr \n\nthe class needs @Injectable() decorator (imported from @angular/core) \nall methods should NOT be static\n\nIf you are planning to submit this wrapper as a PR, few more notes:\n- the QRScanner class will be imported from @ionic-native/qr-scanner. This needs to be fixed in the @usage section of the docs\n- the @name tag in the docs should read QR Scanner\n- the QRScannerStatus interface should be above the class declaration\n. Hey @narayansikarwar\nYou can use the get and set methods to add custom data.\nts\nconst map: GoogleMap = this.googleMaps.create(...);\nmap.addMarker({ position: GOOGLE })\n  .then((marker: Marker) => marker.set('myMsg', 'Hello'));. Sorry, the documentation is wrong/outdated. The plugin doesn't support the browser platform.. Just pushed a commit to fix that :)\n. From what I see in the stack trace, this doesn't look like an Ionic Native issue.. Please read the main page for the Ionic Native docs.. Are you using @ionic-native/core@3.2.4 ?\nIf so, please update that package, as that version has a bug.. Just checked, you're right the methods should be part of the SQLite class. I will fix this soon.. I think this is because the native map is handling all the click events, and the actual Alert component isn't receiving them. \nWhat I would do in this situation is use the Dialogs plugin to display a native Dialog instead of the Ionic Framework's Alert component.\nI'm closing this issue since it's not an Ionic Native issue. I suggest seeking help in the Ionic Forums to see if anyone else has found a solution for this. . Thanks, I'll fix this now.. You're calling the plugin before deviceready has fired. \nWrap your call with this.platform.ready().then(() => { ... });. You're not supposed to inject SQLiteObject in your module. Only SQLite. \nFor more information about the methods and what the difference is between them, please refer to the original plugin repo: https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage. @Ghayyas can you share your code here, and what is the issue that you are having. Fixed now. Update to 3.4.2.. Yes, you're right.. We only catch the errors that our decorators generate: cordova_not_found and plugin_not_installed.. I'm unable to reproduce this with latest version of @ionic-native/core and `@ionic-native/native-audio'.\nWhat version of Ionic Native are you using?. I don't think it makes a difference.. Is this still an issue in latest version?. Update to the latest version of the plugin and it should work fine.\nThis was an issue in 3.4.1 I think.\nSorry for not mentioning this in release notes. I'll update it when I get a chance.. Could you please provide the link to the actual plugin? . - do you have the plugin installed?\n- are you waiting for platform.ready() or deviceready event?\n- are you running on a Cordova platform?\n. @azakusilo just updated the push plugin.\nhasPermission should be part of the Push class and not PushObject.\nCorrect usage is:\nts\nthis.push.hasPermission()\n  .then(res => console.log('Has permission?', res.isEnabled);\nUpdate @ionic-native/push to 3.4.4.. .fetch() returns a promise now. . You only need to inject SecureStorage. You shouldn't inject SecureStorageObject.. I started something here https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-browser but I haven't figured out the best way to do it yet. . I think the developer should implement that in their app. Similar to what Joshua blogged about here: https://www.joshmorony.com/automating-mocks-in-ionic-native-3-x/. Well I think what this repo needs is something like https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/src/mocks\nThe repo I have up there should be more of an accessory that some people might prefer to have. It's more like \"Ionic Hybrid\" than \"Ionic Native\".. Just fixed it.. @gregavola sometimes this weekend, thanks for your patience . See https://github.com/apla/me.apla.cordova.app-preferences#preferences-interface-generator\nThe plugin creates app-settings.json for you in the root directory of your app, see here: https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-playground/blob/master/app-settings.json\nJust modify that file.. Do you have @ionic-native/core installed?. If it takes one callback, there's no need to set successIndex or errorIndex.. Looks like this is fixed.. I tested the regular Admob plugin on an iPad device recently and it worked fine. Not sure if it's supposed to work on a simulator or not.\nWhich plugin are you having issues with? Admob or Admob Free? I will try to test it when I get a chance.. Not sure what you mean. Please submit a new issue and fill out the issue template with more details.. @Barathwaja see this component: https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-playground/blob/master/src/components/google-map/google-map.ts. I'll try to reproduce this when I get a chance.\nIn the meanwhile, could you try something like this:\nts\nthis.deeplinks.routeWithNavController(this.navCtrl, {\n          '/': 'home',\n          '/event/:eventId': 'EventPage',\n          '/events': 'EventsPage',\n          '/place/:placeId': 'PlacePage',\n          '/places': 'places'\n        }).subscribe((match) => {\n            // console.log('Matched route', match)\n          }, (nomatch) => {\n            // console.log('Mismatch route', nomatch);\n          });. @AmitMY is this still an issue? I haven't had the chance yet to reproduce it... Deeplinking not working at all on my end (native and framework).. The error is saying that you haven't imported YoutubeVideoPlayer provider into your app's module. Please follow the Ionic Native docs for more information on installing plugins.\nAlso note that the plugin will not work on ionic serve, it will only work on real devices/simulators.. Ok I'll try to reproduce this when I get a chance.. Should be fixed in the next release.\n```ts\nconstructor(private media: MediaPlugin) {}\n...\nthis.media.create('file.mp3')\n  .then((file: MediaObject) => { ... })\n  .catch(e => console.log('Error opening file', e));\n```. @ghenry22 yes, you're right. I thought the success callback was called when the media object is successfully created. This needs to be fixed.\nThanks for pointing it out.. @ghenry22 sorry I forgot to update the documentation. The usage now is as follows:\nts\nconst file: MediaObject = this.media.create('file.mp3');\nfile.record();\n.create() method takes 3 optional callbacks, onProgress, onSuccess and onError. Full example would be:\n```ts\nconst onProgress = (...args) => console.log('media progress', args);\nconst onSuccess = (...args) => console.log('Media success', args);\nconst onError = (...args) => console.log('Media error', args);\nconst file: MediaObject = this.media.create('file.mp3', onProgress, onSuccess, onError);\nfile.record(); \n```. Is the error emitted by your IDE or the CLI?. I just had a look at the new definitions. It's possible that the callbacks you provided do not match the callbacks expected by function. They're not that flexible now.\nCan you share your code so I can have a look?. Is this issue with Ionic Native 2.x?. Make sure you have the latest version of cordova-plugin-network-information installed. There is nothing wrong with the Ionic Native definitions. (just checked the v2.x repo that has the code for ionic-native@2.9.0)\ncordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-network-information\ncordova-plugin add cordova-plugin-network-information@latest. Closing this issue in favor of #1500.. This doesn't seem like an issue with the Ionic Native wrapper.\nIonic Native is just a wrapper and it has no effect on how the plugin performs. Please seek help at the plugin's repo or at the Ionic Forums.. Please remove the Wikitude plugin files from this PR.. Fixed in 3.9.1, please upgrade @ionic-native/core to 3.9.1 and the issue should be fixed. . See https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/%40ionic-native/core/plugin.ts#L35. Ah I see what's wrong. I forgot to add typeof in this line: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/%40ionic-native/core/plugin.ts#L35\nIt should be:\nif (!pluginInstance || (!!methodName && typeof pluginInstance[methodName] === 'undefined')) {\nIdeally all checks should be in that method and not in the one you modified. Could you please edit your PR and modify the checkAvailability function instead?\n. @AmitMY \nThanks!\nYou're right, the message will be wrong. But I think it's good for most cases. Usually all the methods that we have in our wrappers exist on the original plugin. Which means that methodName should always exist.\n\nHere is why we check both methodName and pluginRef and in both cases we assume that the plugin is not installed/available:\nIf you look at the screen orientation plugin for example, it used to add lockOrientation property to the window.screen object. In this case if we check window.screen only, it will exist on all browsers, but lockOrientation will not exists. So in this case the right error message should say \"plugin not installed\" or \"cordova not available\". \n\nIf you see any plugins that might benefit from having different error messages for pluginRef and methodName, then let me know and we'll have a look at them. I don't mind having more detailed errors, but it's always good to minimize the code that we don't need. (specially run-time stuff like this)\n\nP.S: just fixed the pluginRef for the Rollbar plugin: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/f3969400442dc5d0e28e14a715f3476ac139c42b. @aggarwalankush to keep docs cleaner and less repetitive we don't include the platform.ready() part, but yes you should wait for deviceready to fire before doing anything.. @royipressburger see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39535386/how-to-check-if-angular-2-app-is-running-in-production-or-dev for inspiration. Make sure you wrap your code with platform.ready().then( .. ). If you are running this as soon as the app starts, I suggest waiting a second or so before executing the code. .

Closing this issue since Ionic Native v5 includes all bug fixes/features and it supports Ionic 2.x apps.. This doesn't seem like an issue with the Ionic Native wrapper.\n\n\nIonic Native is just a wrapper and it has no effect on how the plugin performs. Please seek help at the plugin's repo or at the Ionic Forums.. This doesn't seem like an issue with the Ionic Native wrapper.\nIonic Native is just a wrapper and it has no effect on how the plugin performs. Please seek help at the plugin's repo or at the Ionic Forums.. This should be fixed if you're using latest Ionic Native and Angular 4.x. Perhaps set('key', 'value') would make more sense?. Usually you would want your mocks to either return mock data similar to what you would expect on a real device, or provide functionality that can work in the browser.\nIf you have any further questions please visit the Ionic forums.. awesome! thanks @SVANNER . Looks like the Ionic Native implementation of the plugin is correct. This must be an issue with the plugin itself.\nPlease seek help at the plugin's repo or the Ionic forums.. The angular dependency doesn't have a version specified.\njson\n\"@angular/core\": \"*\",\nAre you sure that warning is caused by @ionic-native/app-rate? . @MTechDE you get these warnings every time you run an npm install command, even if it's caused by another package. \nI'm working on a fresh Ionic 3 project right now with Ionic Native dependencies, I'm not seeing these warnings. Maybe you have an old @ionic-native/* package installed that is causing this warning (older packages had a strict Angular dependency  version).. Not an Ionic Native issue. Please seek help at the forums or at the plugin's repo.. 1. Wait for platform.ready()\n2. Call the static method installed() on any plugin. Example: (<any>Camera).installed(). It will return true if the plugin is loaded.. @AmitMY if the pluginRef exists, installed() will return true. Geolocation exists on browsers, and Vibration uses navigator as it's main object so it returns true even though the plugin doesn't actually exist.. We had those @private flags for docs purposes. We can take them out in the next 2.x release.. Closing this issue since Ionic Native v5 includes all bug fixes/features and it supports Ionic 2.x apps.. @dwm-it is this still an issue with ionic native 3.7.0 ?. @Sampath-Lokuge \nI would go with what @danielsogl suggested. If you wish to have a native plugin added with that functionality, please provide a repository that we can have a look at.. @Sampath-Lokuge \nI meant that the current plugin doesn't support real-time database functionality. Unless if you find a plugin with that functionality, we wouldn't be able to add it here. Ionic native is just a wrapper for Cordova plugins.. @saniyusuf \nThe last version fixed the implementation by not returning back a promise. If you look at the plugin's source code here  you can see that the success callback is not used when creating a new instance. Therefore, we shouldn't wait for the promise to resolve to return back the media object. \nI thought this plugin worked fine after 3.6.1 .. but if there are still issues then I'll do some testing soon in my playground app.. Just pushed an update to Media plugin that will be available in the next Ionic Native release.\nthis.media.create(...) will always return an instance of MediaObject now. This instance will only function if the plugin actually exists. This way it will not break your code in the browser ... etc.\nIf you want to only run your code when the plugin is available, wrap it with if(MediaPlugin.installed()).\nI reviewed the implementation of the plugin and it seems like everything is implemented correctly, so if there are any issues I highly doubt that they are Ionic Native related. It is most likely issues with Apache's plugin.. Seems like an issue with the plugin and not with the Ionic Native implementation.. Looks like any Ionic Native issues related have been fixed, closing this issue. \nFeel free to submit a PR to clarify any quirks you find with the plugin.. You need to call the method .file() to get this data. Example:\nthis.file.resolveLocalFilesystemUrl(...)\n  .then((file: FileEntry) => {\n    file.file(meta => console.log(meta), error => console.log(error));\n  });. Does this fix your issue https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/7205#issuecomment-230977122 ?. The method was just updated in 3.7.0 as well to add the missing parameters.. AFAIK public is only needed when the variable is being used in the template or by another class. I never experienced any issues by using private. . I vote to add it as local-notifications-2 or phonegap-local-notifications. I don't think we should replace the existing plugin.\nI agree with @John-Luke, the plugin seem to have less functionality than the \"unofficial\" plugin. . We've had this PR for awhile: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/1166. @battika this is why I suggested in other comments to wait until v2 is stable before updating our wrapper. \nWe can't predict what their final API will look like, and it will be time consuming to try and keep up with them. . Thanks for the update @wf9a5m75 . Closing this in favour of #1759 . Sorry I forgot to change the core package dependency in the new release. Please update @ioniv-native/core to 3.6.0. @PedroDiniz you need to add the package name to the command. Not just npm install --save by itself. \nI believe they were suggesting that you run\nnpm i --save @ionic-native/network@latest @ionic-native/network@latest. The wrapper was written incorrectly. It is now fixed in 3.7.0.\nPlease update to latest @ionic-native/flurry-analytics and follow the documentation here (until the official docs are updated): http://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com/docs/native/flurry-analytics/. Please update @ionic-native/core to at least 3.6.0\nnpm i --save @ionic-native/core@latest. It's npm i --save @ionic-native/core@latest .. not just npm i --save @latest . @krvajalmiguelangel I think you're still using Ionic Native 2.x... In Ionic Native 3.x, all methods are NOT static. See Badge class definition here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/%40ionic-native/plugins/badge/index.ts. thanks @rapropos !. @obermoserkitz https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/7205#issuecomment-230977122. Fixed and will be available in the next release.. Thanks @MTechDE ! you're the best.. Looks like an issue with the plugin and not with the Ionic Native implementation. Please seek help in the forums or at the plugin's repo.\nFeel free to keep the conversation going here but I'm closing this.. This issue was moved to driftyco/ionic-plugin-deeplinks#106. usesUntilPrompt goes in the main preferences object, not in preferences.storeAppUrl. @MTechDE sorry one more change \ud83d\ude05 .. from my experience, things don't work as expected when overriding the preferences object. It's better to set the preferences.usesUntilPrompt and preferences.storeAppUrl properties separately. \nThe preferences property is just a regular property, it doesn't have a setter/getter to take care of merging with default config. See https://github.com/pushandplay/cordova-plugin-apprate/blob/master/www/AppRate.js#L168. Yeah I just looked through the source code again, it doesn't seem to matter if the properties exist or not (so the example your provided should work fine, no need to use mine). They're always being checked before being used. So it should be fine. But people need to know that overriding the whole preferences object will remove any default configuration (i.e usesUntilPrompt, promptAgainForEachNewVersion).. Maybe use both. quick example:\n```ts\n// set certain preferences\nthis.appRate.preferences.storeAppUrl = { ... }; // ( current docs would stay here )\n// or, override the whole preferences object\nthis.appRate.preferences = { ... } // ( your common config here, or the new example you provided )\n```. thanks @MTechDE . @dpa99c \nThanks for the PR!\nTLDR: It just needs one quick change, we need to specify successIndex and errorIndex in the @Cordova() decorator as follows:\nts\n@Cordova({\n  successIndex: 1,\n  errorIndex: 2\n})\nDetailed explanation:\nWhen there is an optional parameter, we need to add successIndex and errorIndex properties to the @Cordova() decorator. The decorator can't tell what the signature of the method is, it just takes the arguments passed to the function and passes them to the original method. \nFor example:\n```ts\n// if we call isCameraAvailable without explicitly providing value for externalStorage\nthis.diagnostics.isCameraAvailable();\n// it will result in the original method being invoked like this\ncordova.plugins.diagnostic.isCameraAvailable(onSuccess, onError);\n```\nSo we need to specify our success and error index in the decorator as follows to fix this issue:\nts\n@Cordova({\n  successIndex: 1,\n  errorIndex: 0\n})\nNow the original method will be invoked with the following arguments if we use the same example above:\njs\ncordova.plugins.diagnostic.isCameraAvailable(undefined, onSuccess, onError);. @akz92 can you provide sample code demonstrating what you're trying to do?. Nevermind, I figured out what you're looking for. I will create an interface named IFile that follows the Web API spec and extends Blob. . CC: @perrygovier . @piotrowski it's not published to production yet .. see http://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com/docs/native/onesignal/. Oh you picked a tricky plugin to be your first \ud83d\ude01 ... I personally think the plugin is poorly made (the actual plugin by phonegap).\nThe way this wrapper needs to work is:\n```ts\ndeclare var Notification: any;\n// can use a shorter name here, like PLNObject ?\nexport class PhonegapLocalNotificationObject {\nprivate _objectInstance: any;\n// instance properties can go here, see https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-local-notification/blob/master/www/notification.js#L23-L33\n  @CordovaProperty title: string;\n  @CordovaProperty dir: string;\n  @CordovaProperty lang: string;\nconstructor(title: string, options: any) {\n    if (checkCordovaAvailablity('Notification') === true) {\n      // if _objectInstance doesn't exist, nothing with the @CordovaInstance or @CordovaProperty decorator will work\n      this._objectInstance = new Notification(title, options);\n    }\n  }\n@CordovaInstance({ sync: true })\n  close(): void { }\n}\n@Plugin({\n  ...\n})\n@Injectable()\nexport class PhonegapLocalNotification {\ncreate(title: string, options: any) { return new PhonegapLocalNotificationObject(title, options); }\n@Cordova()\n  requestPermission(): Promise { return; }\n}\n```. @danielsogl \nSorry it's checkAvailability not checkCordovaAvailabilty ... and it's exported by @ionic-native/core\nHere's an example: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/%40ionic-native/plugins/google-maps/index.ts#L64\n. @danielsogl what build errors?. According to the author's comment here https://github.com/NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio/issues/16#issuecomment-291015106 the plugin seem to be ok. I guess we can remove the beta tag for this plugin.. I think this should stay as beta. The project is discontinued https://github.com/hypery2k/cordova-hotspot-plugin#cordova-hotspot-plugin. SuccessIndex and error index are not needed. Yes @danielsogl, the code before this change was correct.\n\n. Please refrain from importing FileReader into your project and just call it directly. The class FileReader that we have is just a declaration and it's not supposed to be defined in runtime. . Is this caused by --prod or by --release ? \nCan you still access cordova.file.externalRootDirectory ?. This is a duplicate of the recent PR you submitted right?. Just fixed it in https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/10d61c21c29252495b9a72a118795af400771a0b .. should be fixed in next patch release.. @pliablepixels what platform?. This issue was moved to driftyco/ionic-site#1096. What version of @ionic-native/file are you using?. Tested with 3.8.0 and it works well @xupea . This is not a plugin that we support at Ionic Native. I suggest seeking help at the plugin's repo.. @danielsogl we only update that if the core package has a breaking/required change. As of now it makes no difference if people use 3.6.0 or 3.7.0 for the core package. It makes things simpler.. Please provide a link to the repository or the NPM package of the plugin when making a plugin request.. This behavior is intentional for plugins that create an instance of another object. In this situation the promise should ideally reject but in other cases like Google Maps it's better to create an instance object that doesn't do anything. Here's an example of why this is ideal:\n```ts\nlet map: GoogleMap = this.googleMaps.create(...);\n// the browser will throw an error because map.on doesn't exist\nmap.on('MAP_READY')\n  .then(() => { ... });\n```\nI will review these plugins again and implement a universal fix. Maybe the plugins that return a promise (like this one) should reject, and the rest of them can return a dummy object.\n. @eboukamza thanks I fixed it and published a new release now. I didn't notice that until I tried building the plugin.. This isn't an issue with the Ionic Native wrapper. You should post this at the Ionic forums or the plugin's repo.. The repo url is posted our official docs page https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/google-maps/. https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/issues .... Not sure what you mean. Please follow the issue template and provide a proper description of the issue. \nThe YouTube Player plugin seem to be implemented correctly.. Sure @naveedahmed1 \nFor now you can do the following:\n```ts\nimport { LinkedIn } from '@ionic-native/linkedin'; \nLinkedIn.getPlugin().getActiveSession(onSuccess, onError);\n```. @kamok what version of rxjs and what version of Ionic native are you using?. Regarding the first issue, the PERMISSION object was defined incorrectly. I just fixed it and it should work well in the next release. \nAs for the second issue, the function requestPermissions takes an array of strings, not a single string. The typescript definition is incorrect. I fixed this as well and added requestPermission method to request a single permission.. Have a look at https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/ebf402864bda19fc1c937a71c3bcdd4d6c8bdff2\nI will publish a release soon once I review some more issues.. I think this would be an issue with the plugin and not Ionic Native. I suggest you review their documentation and issues at their repo https://github.com/VitaliiBlagodir/cordova-plugin-datepicker. marker.getPosition() is an async method that returns a promise that resolves with a GoogleMapLatLng object.. @hayuki I will try to reproduce this issue now and figure out what the problem is.. Ok, now I see what's wrong here.\nThis is wrong:\nts\nmarker.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MARKER_DRAG_END).subscribe((marker: Marker) => { ... })\nWhen the marker emits the event, it doesn't return back an object typeof Marker. It returns back the original Marker object from the actual plugin and not from Ionic Native. So instead of the above, you need to do this:\nts\nmarker.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MARKER_DRAG_END).subscribe(() => { ... })\nThis will make marker refer to the original marker variable that you had defined earlier (which was produced by Ionic Native. \nThe signature for marker.getPosition on the original object is getPosition(callback) and it doesn't return anything (it returns the LatLng object through the callback).\n\nFor reference, the code was tested here: https://github.com/ihadeed/ionic-native-playground/blob/ionic-native-1577/src/pages/google-maps/google-maps.ts#L17-L29. Just tested on Android 6.x, using latest versions of: Ionic Framework, Ionic CLI, Ionic Native and Camera plugin. I wasn't able to reproduce this issue. \nI doubt that this is an Ionic Native issue. Try this out and let me know if you get the same result, replace your code with this:\nts\nCamera.getPlugin().getPicture({\n      destinationType : this.camera.DestinationType.DATA_URL,\n      sourceType : this.camera.PictureSourceType.CAMERA,\n      encodingType: this.camera.EncodingType.JPEG,\n      quality : 75,\n      targetWidth: 1000,\n      targetHeight: 1000,\n      allowEdit : false,\n      saveToPhotoAlbum: false\n    }, imageData => {\n      this.base64Image = \"data:image/jpeg;base64,\" + imageData;\n    }, error => {\n      console.log(\"ERROR -> \" + JSON.stringify(error));\n    });. @georgechapman ok then this is not an Ionic Native issue.\nTry updating both your plugin and your android platform.\ncordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-camera\ncordova platform rm android\ncordova platform add android@latest\ncordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera@latest\nIf you're still experiencing issues then I suggest that you report this to Apache at their issue tracker. (you can find the link in the plugin's repo).. Duplicate of #1578. - Rule of thumb is that you have to wait for deviceready to fire before calling any plugin. We don't document this in every plugin's usage because it is documented in the Ionic Native's main docs page.\n- The Google Maps docs show that you have to wait for ngAfterViewInit because we need the DOM to be ready before we pass on the HTMLElement over to the Google Maps plugin to work with it\n- No need to implement AfterViewInit, it's optional. Refer to Angular's docs.\nThanks for the PR though.. @helderdiniz there wasn't an issue with your code, it was just mistake with the latest CI tests script I published. Everything is fine. Thanks for the PR :). @Hanfrey are you using the latest version of @ionic-native/health-kit ?. How is the code wrong?\nThe method takes an object as parameter. If you look at the object's interface you can see that it accepts readTypes and writeTypes  which are set to any.. meaning you can provide anything including an array.. Are you calling .then() on the promise?. From @popovicidinu on May 19, 2017 13:33\nI'm doing something like this:\nts\nthis.linkedIn.login(['r_basicprofile', 'r_emailaddress'], false)\n      .then( (success) => {\n         // trying to console log here\n      })\n      .catch( (error) => {\n        console.log(error);\n    });\nThe problem is that nothing is outputting, no errors, nothing. When my function is being called, I do see the LinkedIn loading splashscreen for a bit, but after that it disappears. . @popovicidinu Are you testing this in the browser or on a device?\n. @popovicidinu do you have the LinkedIn app installed? I see you're passing false as the second parameter, which means that if the app isn't installed it will not prompt the user to install it.\n. @popovicidinu just tested the plugin on Android 6.x and it works fine. Did you add your package ID and key hash to the LinkedIn Developer dashboard?. @popovicidinu \nNevermind, I can confirm that it doesn't resolve the promise (or call the callback method). Seems like an issue with the plugin.\nLet's move the convo back to https://github.com/zyra/cordova-plugin-linkedin/issues/14 .. Sorry about that.. To submit a feature request, you need to provide us with a link to a Github repository or an NPM package for a Cordova plugin. \nI'm closing this issue but feel free to keep the conversation going. If you manage to write a plugin for this feature then we can create an Ionic Native wrapper for it.. > This is happening because we're just passing the callback as-is to the plugin, we're not converting it to a promise/observable. It's possible to fix it, but I think it's better to have less Angular specific code in Ionic Native. I recommend wrapping it with ngZone.run(() => { ... }) manually.. My response from the forum:\n\nOn a second thought... \nWe can solve this issue without adding Angular specific code in Ionic Native (ngZone.run() ... etc). \nWe can change the definitions of the Media plugin to work as follows:\nts\nlet file: MediaObject = this.media.create('file.mp3');\nfile.onSuccess().subscribe(() => { ... }); // replaces onSuccessCallback\nfile.onError().subscribe(() => { ... }); // replaces the onErrorCallback\nfile.onStatusUpdate().subscribe(() => { ... }); // replaces onStatusUpdate\nThis means that the .create() function will no longer take the callbacks as parameters. Ionic Native will create those callbacks and converts them into Observables since they emit data more than once. I can probably do this in a way that doesn't break old apps... (the backwards compatibility will be removed in Ionic Native 4.x). According to this https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-media/#parameters\n\nThe success callback gets called when play, record or stop action has completed. I assume the  error callback is called whenever an error has occurred in any of these functions. It's kinda tricky. Not sure why don't they just have callbacks for each method instead of using a shared one.\nI haven't used the plugin enough to figure out how these callbacks work. I'm just working with what I understand from their docs. I'll have to dig into their source code or test the plugin more to understand how things are supposed to work.. Just looked at their source code.. Success and error callbacks are used multiple times. . @ghenry22 \nFrom what I see in the source code, they are calling it it every time the media stops: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media/blob/master/www/Media.js#L209\nI guess that's when .play() finishes, or when .stop() or .stopRecording() is called. Error callback is passed as the error callback for almost every method.. @ghenry22 \nPlease try @ionic-native/media@dev and let me know if it works well.\n```ts\nlet file = this.media.file('file.mp3');\nfile.onSuccess.subscribe(..);\nfile.onError.subscribe(...);\nfile.onStatusChange.subscribe(...);\n```. @ghenry22 did you get a chance to test it? I'm releasing 4.0 soon and I would like to include this.\nIf you haven't tested it that's fine, I'll run a test when I get a chance.. Please read the following doc page to understand how Ionic Native 3.x works: https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/\nAlso have a look at the usage section of this page https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/facebook/. Duplicate of #1547 ... not an Ionic Native issue... Doesn't seem like an issue with Ionic Native. I suggest you create an issue at the plugin's repo instead.. This is not an Ionic native issue. I suggest you open an issue at the plugins repo.\nAlso, try re installing the plugin/platform.. This is not an issue with Ionic Native.. Just how the plugin works.\nI'm not so sure how it to works to be honest. I noticed that if I just provide a file name it works well. But if I try to provide a full path like what you're trying to do, it doesn't work that well. \nWhen I provide only the file name, it saves it to the root storage directory of my Android device.\nI'll try to have a look at this when I get a chance. Let me know if you figure it out. We should probably update the docs so the usage is more clear.. Ok I just figured out how to get this working on Android...\nI tried using full file URLs and it didn't work, even with cdvfile:/// protocol. Here's what did work though:\n\ncreate new media file, enter file name only, not a full path. Example file.mp3\nrecord to the file\nstop recording\nwait a second or so (or wait for onStatusChange event to fire)\nnow the file should be available at /sdcard/file.mp3... meaning you can retrieve it by calling this.file.resolveLocalFilesystemUrl(this.file.externalRootDirectory + 'file.mp3')\nyou can now move the file elsewhere if you wish...\n\nSo my guess is that on Android, the path is relative to /sdcard/ (or externalRootDirectory).\nI haven't tested this on iOS yet but by reading their docs here, it looks like you can do something like this:\nts\nlet file = this.media.create(this.file.tempDirectory + 'file.mp3');\n\nHere's my code:\n```ts\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Platform } from 'ionic-angular';\nimport { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home';\nimport { MediaPlugin } from '@ionic-native/media';\nimport { File } from '@ionic-native/file';\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: 'app.html',\n  providers: [ MediaPlugin, File ]\n})\nexport class MyApp {\n  rootPage:any = HomePage;\nconstructor(platform: Platform, media: MediaPlugin, file: File) {\n    platform.ready()\n      .then(() => {\n    let stopCount = 0;\n\n    const fileName: string = 'myfile2.mp3';\n\n    let m = media.create(fileName, (status) => {\n      console.log('Status updated. ', status, (status === 4 && ++stopCount === 2 && m.getDuration()) || '');\n    }, x => console.log('Success: ',  x), e => console.log('Error: ',  e));\n\n    m.startRecord();\n    console.log('RECORDING');\n\n\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      m.stopRecord();\n      console.log('DONE RECORDING');\n\n      m.play();\n      console.log('PLAYING');\n\n      file.resolveLocalFilesystemUrl(file.externalRootDirectory + fileName)\n        .then(r => console.log(r))\n        .catch(e => console.log('Error #2: ',  e));\n\n    }, 3000);\n\n\n\n  });\n\n}\n}\n``\n. Next time try to combine similar PRs into one.. What are you asking for here exactly?. @danbucholtz do we have a way to serve from the cordova browser platform directory instead ofwww` ?. @piotrowski is there a way to enable livereload with that?\ndoes ionic cordova run browser -l work?. @jamesparkes did you try ionic cordova run browser -l ? . This issue was moved to ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts#1044. Please provide a link to the original docs that mention this.. Yeah, show should return an Observable instead of a Promise. I didn't notice that the callback is multi-purpose... . Not an Ionic Native issue.\nI suggest you do further debugging and figure out who is causing this problem (WKWebview, Media plugin, or Background mode) and open an issue at their repo.. Wouldn't it be misleading to have Electron listed as a supported platform? Since there is no Cordova Electron platform really.\nCorrect me if in wrong, but any browser supported plugin should work on Electron too.\nI think one day we will have an actual Electron platform, and plugins will have Electron specific code that taps into their APIs. That's when it would make sense to list Electron as a platform.. Could you please fix the lint issues. nice!. Thanks @danielsogl \nCan you submit them in separate PRs? so we can have them all show up in the Changelog automatically. Please submit a new issue and fill out the template provided. We need to know what is the expected behavior and what issues are you experiencing. . Install danielsogl-cordova-plugin-clipboard or cordova-clipboard and it should work fine.. Did you try the other package I mentioned? \nThe error you're getting from installing cordova-clipboard is most likely caused by a missing Android Build tools package. It's not even a problem caused by the plugin.. the plugin has no library requirements so it shouldn't throw any errors.\nI recommend you update all the Android libraries from the SDK manager, then remove the platforms/android directory and run cordova platform add android@latest . https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-imageResizer is not the same plugin. @Anilinfo2015 please open a new issue and make sure to fill out the issue template. The information you provided isn't enough for us to help you.. Just pushed a commit to fix this. Will be available in the next patch release.\nThanks for reporting this!. This has nothing to do with Ionic Native. \nI suggest that you look for help at the forums or elsewhere.. This doesn't seem like an issue with Ionic Native.\nIonic Native is just a wrapper and has no effect on how the plugin performs. I recommend asking for support at the plugin's repo or at the Ionic Forums.. This doesn't seem like an issue with Ionic Native.\nIonic Native is just a wrapper and has no effect on how the plugin performs. I recommend asking for support at the plugin's repo or at the Ionic Forums.. We have an issue open for this here: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/issues/751 .. subscribe to it to get updates on the progress.\nWe also have a couple of PRs open for this update. We will merge it soon with the next major release  4.x.. This should be closed now? since your recent PR fixed it?. @neoassyrian what do you mean by \"update the files locally\"? what are you trying to update?. Can you provide links to the fork(s) that you recommend?. I personally was using https://github.com/Switch168/cordova-HTTP for awhile. Worked well. I replaced it recently with a new HTTP plugin that I wrote (not publicly available yet).\nIf each repo has one good thing about it, we can create a new fork and combine them together, then publish to NPM.. I can take care of it.. what is the Switch168 fork missing?. Forgot to push my commit again. Just pushed it :)\nThanks @danielsogl . I sense an issue with change detection here.\nI've had this problem before with one of my apps. Can't remember if/how I fixed it. The issue occurred when opening an InAppBrowser instance, typing something in there, then closing the IAB window. Things just start to act weird afterwards. . The information you provided isn't enough to diagnose this issue. \nAlso, Ionic Native issues can only impact the process of compiling your Ionic app, and not your Cordova project (Android/iOS platforms.. etc). So, it looks like this isn't an issue with Ionic Native and it is possibly an issue with the plugin, or some other plugin that is conflicting with it.. @EdvardGilz please open a new issue and fill out the template. Looks like an issue with the plugin, and not with the Ionic Native wrapper. I'm going to close this issue but feel free to keep the conversation going.\nTo verify that it's not an Ionic Native issue, please run the following command and compare the behaviour with the one you experienced earlier:\n```ts\nimport { Geolocation } from '@ionic-native/geolocation';\n...\n// run this somewhere in your code\nGeolocation.getPlugin().getCurrentPosition(x => console.log('Success', x), e => console.log('Error', e));\n```. Thanks @thielCole . This doesn't seem like an issue with Ionic Native.\nIonic Native is just a wrapper and has no effect on how the plugin performs. I recommend asking for support at the plugin's repo or at the Ionic Forums.. thanks!. I haven't gotten enough feedback regarding this plugin. Not sure if people even want it. So for now it will stay as IAP2. I've had this issue too recently.. it's very frustrating when trying to deal with the file directly. (to upload, move.. etc)\nThis is an issue with the plugin and not with Ionic Native. I suggest you open an issue at the Apache tracker or in the Ionic Forums.. See http://ionicframework.com/docs/native/transfer/. The error message you provided doesn't contain any specific package name that I can use to reproduce this issue with. Therefore, I can't verify if this is an actual issue with Ionic Native.. Uninstall com.danielsogl.cordova.clipboard and install cordova-clipboard.. Doesn't seem like an Ionic Native issue. You are using browser printing functionality and not the Ionic Native plugin. \n@jgw96 perhaps this is a framework issue?. Ionic Native wraps Cordova plugins. Even though this plugin doesn't require any native code, it still runs on a native platform. You need to run your app on Cordova Browser platform if you wish to take advantage of the browser capabilities. Alternatively, you can copy their code and inject it in your app manually.. It would work fine if you define the whole this.appRate.preferences object. See the second example in here http://ionicframework.com/docs/native/app-rate/\nI will take out the first one. I thought I already removed it earlier.. Yes. You need to add a catch block to the promise. \n```ts\n// noop catch block\nfcm.subscribeToTopic('marketing').catch(() => {});\n// useful catch block\nfcm.subscribeToTopic('marketing').catch(e => console.log('Error subscribing to topic', e));\n. 1. are you waiting for `platform.ready()` or `deviceready` event?\n2. Does this work:js\ndocument.addEventListener('online', () => console.log('Online!'), false);\n```. You didn't answer my second question, does that code snippet work as expected? or are you having the same issues with it?\nAlso, if you are running this code on app startup, try adding a 1 second delay before executing it. Sometimes platform.ready() fires too early.. Doesn't the framework still use angular 4.1.3?. If you think this is an Ionic Native issue (which I doubt), please try the following versions of @ionic-native/media and let me know if your issue is fixed:\n- 3.9.0\n- 3.6.0\n- 3.5.0\nThe versions above contained changes to the media plugin. None of the changes could've caused this issue though. Seems like a problem caused by the plugin. . Looks like you're running on ionic serve. That doesn't count as a browser platform. To run on browser platform you need to run cordova run browser. \nIonic Native plugins don't work on ionic serve. I think the only plugin that works is Geolocation, because it follows the standard WebAPI that's supported by all browsers.. Not an Ionic Native issue. Please ask your question on the forums.\nI personally can use this plugin on Android 7+ without any issues. You just need to make sure that the location services are enabled before requesting the location. You can use the Diagnostic plugin for that.. Doesn't seem like an Ionic Native specific issue. I suggest you ask for help on the forums.. I just tried creating a similar object in WebStorm without issues.\nIt could be an issue with the IDE... use any as a type instead of ActionSheetOptions.. This isn't an Ionic Native issue. I suggest you report this at the plugin's repo.\nUpdate your Cordova CLI to 6.4.0 or higher, then do the following:\ncordova platform rm --save android\ncordova platform add --save android@latest. @Gurit-ONEBCG just tested it on a Nexus 5x device with Android 7.1.x. It works well. You just need to make sure that the location services are enabled before requesting location. You can use the Diagnositcs plugin to this.. Remove the Clipboard plugin you already have, and install this one:\ncordova plugin add cordova-clipboard\nIt's a package that I published (forked from original plugin) and I am currently using it in my Ionic Native Playground app without issues.\nIf it works well, let me know and I will change the docs.. Not sure what the issue is here, or if it's even related to Ionic Native. \nOnce you've have narrowed down the cause of the problem, or gathered more info. You can open a new issue at the appropriate repo. Also, make sure to fill out the issue template.. Attn. @mlynch @perrygovier . @emir-harbinja for now, you can visit the 2.x branch and go through the definitions to find the docs there.\nAlso, out of curiosity, may I ask what is the reason you are still using Ionic Native 2.x? . katzer's repo was not maintained for awhile, and the plugin wasn't functioning properly. That's why we switched.\nI guess we can switch back to katzer's repo now.. The better way is what max talked about here #1622 ... or alternatively, what Telerik is kinda doing. Fork plugins, make sure they're stable, and support them privately (rather than relying on the developer). This ensures that the framework's users are happy with functional plugins. . Isn't AngularJS the same as Angular 1.x ? Maybe we should just keep AngularJS there. Closing this since it's not an issue with an Ionic Native wrapper.\nPlease ask for support in the Ionic Forums instead.. The target property is the LatLngBounds.. ~You can do the same with Ionic Native..~\nts\nmap.getBounds();. ~Sorry I was wrong.~\n~You can do the following for now:~\nts\nmap._objectInstance.getBounds();\n~map._objectInstance returns the original map object.~. I don't see map.getBounds() in the plugin's docs https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps-doc/tree/master/v1.4.0/class/Map\nI'm not sure where you got that example from. The plugin doesn't follow the JavaScript SDK.. Ionic Native wraps the Cordova Plugin. It doesn't work with the JavaScript SDK provided by Google.. Can you provide me with link to the plugin's docs where they document the label property?. I don't see the Label property anywhere in the official docs: https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps-doc/tree/master/v2.0.0/class/Marker\nLet me know if you find it and we can take another look at this issue. Closing for now.. The error is straight forward, it says that there is an unused import. Remove it and the error will go away.. CordovaProperty is the unused import.. What are you trying to do? \nDevelop a new plugin for Ionic Native?\nClone the repo, run npm install, then follow the developer guide: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md. @kongdewen1994 what is the error youre getting?. Yeah then you're not using the import... this is not an issue with your dependencies. You are importing something in the file and not using it..

Please provide a link to the original plugin that supports this change.. thanks !. Thanks.. I edited the PR to reflect that change properly.. Ionic native modules do not depend on @ionic/app-scripts. That error is probably caused by another module. If there is an unmet dependency, the warning is displayed on every command. . Are you having issues because you're trying to install from a git repo? try installing from cordova-plugin-telerik-imagepicker instead of that git repo link. Already pushed a commit to update it. It will be published to the production site some time soon.. @JaneDawson your issue is different, see https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps-doc/tree/master/v2.0.0/migrate-from-v1#removed-the-xxxclicked-properties. @JaneDawson yes, that was mentioned in the 4.0.0 release notes. See https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/releases/tag/v4.0.0\n\nUsually major version changes means there are some breaking changes.. @wf9a5m75 do you think there's anything wrong with our wrapper that's causing this? or is this an issue with the plugin?. Thanks @wf9a5m75 \nI only tested map events in my Ionic Native Playground app, so I know that the BaseClass works well and it attaches the event listeners correctly. \n. Thanks @wf9a5m75 . @mebibou this is fixed now. I think the production site wasn't updated at the time you checked the docs.. can you replace readHR and startHrNotification methods with the following:\n```ts\n  readHR() {\n    console.log('Is readHR in NGZone?', NgZone.isInAngularZone());\n    this.startHrNotification()\n      .subscribe((response) => {\n    console.log('Is Observable Callback in NgZone?', NgZone.isInAngularZone());\n    var data = new Uint8Array(response);\n\n    // this is a WORKAROUND to resolve the issue\n    this.zone.run(() => this.heartRate = data[1]);  // this gets updated\n    console.log(this.heartRate);\n  })\n\n}\nstartHrNotification(): Observable {\n    console.log('Is startHrNotification in Angular Zone?', NgZone.isInAngularZone());\n    if (!this.connected) {\n      console.log('Not Connected');\n    } else {\n      return this.ble.startNotification(this.deviceId, \"180d\", \"2a37\")\n    }\n  }\n```\nLet me know what the results are.. @PurpleEdge2214 \nI looked at the wrapper and I couldn't find anything wrong with it, can't tell why you're experiencing this issue. I'll investigate it further when I get a chance. I can't give you a time estimate. This isn't going to be a top priority since it's not a major issue, and also because I don't have a BLE based application\nIt seems like you have a nice work around (NgZone.run()). So, I'm assuming that your app should be functioning well until there's a fix for this issue. . This means that the method now returns an promise.\nts\nthis.push.finish()\n  .then(successHandler)\n  .catch(errorHandler);\n. I'll fix this soon.\nYou can still do something like this at the moment:\nts\n(this.push as any).finish(id);. If they update the Rxjs version in the framework/app-base repo, then we can update it here. We're keeping the dependencies as consistent as possible. \nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/package.json#L29. That's v1 .. the new wrapper in ionic native 4.0 supports v2 which is still in beta. Should be released as stable soon.. Please provide a reference that supports this change. A link to the original plugin that documents this can work.. Ionic Native wraps Cordova plugins, not native SDKs. \nYour PR here: https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner/pull/467 needs to be merged before we can merge this.. Closing this\nLet me know when https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner/pull/467 gets merged, and we can revisit this.. Their docs don't mention the callbacks, but they are present in the source code: \nhttps://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin/blob/master/www/analytics.js#L3\nThe callbacks are also used on the native side. \n- Android: https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin/blob/master/android/UniversalAnalyticsPlugin.java#L158\n- iOS: https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin/blob/master/ios/UniversalAnalyticsPlugin.m#L34\nIt looks to me that the Ionic Native wrapper is written correctly, and it is passing the resolve/reject methods of the promise to the method as callbacks. I'm not sure why they're not being fired. \nI doubt that it has anything to do with the plugin not being ready, if that was the case, you would get Ionic Native error plugin_not_installed.\n. Ah yeah, if you're using the older version of the plugin things wouldn't work. The successCallback param will receive undefined, and errorCallback will receive the actual success callback. \nWe updated the API for v2.2.7 ... https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#227-2016-11-24 which was a long time ago.\nNo, we don't currently have a proper way to check what plugin versions do we support. There is an open discussion regarding this here: #717. Sorry about that, I made a mistake when updating this plugin. I will publish an update soon with a fix.. The plugins repo already has a note regarding app store compliance. \nThere only thing that should be done here is copying that note to our docs to make sure everybody sees it.\nIf you find another plugin that is compliant with the app store policy and achieves the same functionality, feel free to submit a new feature request.. This should be fixed by #1815 . The error is thrown by Cordova CLI. It's saying that the current directory isn't a Cordova project. This is probably because you didn't run npm run build to generate the www directory.. Sorry @Jhonnybmx, this problem is not linked to Ionic Native in any way. I suggest you post your issue on the forums or the appropriate Github repo. . @janpio \nI wrote some code awhile ago to have Ionic Native automatically install the required plugins when you install the @ionic-native/* NPM package. That's why some plugins have installVariables defined in the config.\n\nIt needs some improvements though. It runs through npm scripts, and that comes with some issues. I thought it would be better to have an Ionic CLI tool that takes care of this stuff. Something like:\n```bash\nthis will run the following two commands:\n- npm i --save @ionic-native/file\n- ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-file\nionic native add file\nupdate all ionic native packages\nionic native update\nupdate ionic native packages + cordova plugins\nionic native update -a \nupdate one plugin\nionic native update file\nupdate one plugin and it's cordova plugin\nionic native update file -a\n. Question, how to access the `Spherical` and `Encoding` objects? Is it something like this:ts\nnew plugin.google.maps.geometry.Spherical();\nnew plugin.google.maps.geometry.Encoding();\n``. Ok, in that case,pluginRefneeds to beplugin.google.maps.geometry.sphericaland instead of usingCordovaInstancedecorator, useCordova`. Apply same fix to the Encoder class.\n. By pluginRef I meant this line here: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/1815/files#diff-e65e72a6b528c5e19ecc3c9793cdfd7fR896\npluginRef is basically a reference to the object that contains the original methods. (in this case plugin.google.maps.geometry.spherical)\nThe @Cordova decorator calls the method plugin.google.maps.geometry.spherical.computeDistanceBetween with the arguments provided. It takes the pluginRef and adds the method name to it. Depending on the config passed to the decorator, it can convert callbacks to a promise/observable. . Ok, I made a few fixes. It good to go now, unless if you wanted to add something else to the PR.. Will publish a release some time tonight.. Sorry, forgot to update this thread.\nPublished 4.1.0 last night with this fix included.\nnpm i --save @ionic-native/google-maps@latest should do that job.. @wf9a5m75 this repo updates the staging site automatically, the production site is updated manually by the Ionic Team. . @K1N5L4Y3R just submitted a new review. Once you fix those issues, I will review it once more to make sure that the signatures match the original plugin.. Looks good now. . Should be released over the next few days (maybe today).\nThe beta tags marks it as a beta plugin I'm the docs. This is because it's a new plugin and it's hasn't proven relibility yet.. The usage documented in the repo is invalid.\nMy fork is just to fix a few issues with the plugin config.xml, I didn't really take a look at the docs. \nFollow the Ionic Native docs.. As of Ionic Native 4.x, it's @ionic-native/file-transfer. Please read the change logs, specially when there's a major release.. Thanks. @wf9a5m75 updated this in #1834 . @FCSz So you're asking that we should add a block on each doc page that shows how to add the provider to your app's NgModule?. @Sampath-Lokuge  @MJGz  I'll discuss this with the Ionic team and get back to you. . @nonamez Ionic Native 4.x supports Google Maps v2 only. If you're still using v1 of the plugin, please use @ionic-native/google-maps@3.14.0\nSee https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/releases/tag/v4.0.0 for more info. @wf9a5m75 \nI'll take a look and publish it soon.\nTo install locally, you can run npm run build google-maps in the root directory of ionic-native. Then copy dist/google-maps directory and use it instead of the old node_modules/@ionic-native/google-maps in your Ionic app.\nYou can also use npm link but I'm not quite sure how that works. . @wf9a5m75 \nSounds good.\nAlso, checkout a small demo that I made here:\nhttps://github.com/zyra/ionic-native-playground/blob/master/src/components/google-map/google-map.ts\nhttps://github.com/zyra/ionic-native-playground/tree/master/src/pages/google-maps\nI was hoping to create a modular google maps component that makes it super easy to use google maps anywhere, instead of setting everything up manually. \nI also thought about creating a hybrid Google Maps component/module that wraps your plugin and the JavaScript SDK. This way we would have a high performance Google Maps that works on both mobile apps and PWAs. I think I have some code on my laptop, can't remember how developed it is though.. @wf9a5m75 \nIt's a module, but not part of Ionic Native. It's not within the scope of this project.. @wf9a5m75 observables/promises can only pass 1 argument. You must convert them to an array/object.. @wf9a5m75 \nI tried addressing this problem a long time ago. I didn't merge it though. I wasn't sure if people needed this.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/701/files\nThis basically converts the arguments to an array in case there was only one argument passed.. @wf9a5m75 \nI have a fix for that too here: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/commit/7c13bae755076baa8cc50dc5f3d77156ba72a32b\n. @wf9a5m75 \nThat method is used by the Cordova decorator.\nIf we implement that code, you can do this:\nts\n@Cordova({\n  destruct: true\n})\nsomeMethod(): Promise<any> { return; }\nThen it will automatically pass arguments as an array instead of a single argument. \nWe can change it so that it automatically detects if more than 1 argument was passed, and returns an array. This way we don't have to pass destruct, and we can have functions that would pass 1 argument, or an array of arguments. I think this would be the way to go, since the on method can return 1 or more args.. Why did you create a FakeObservable class?\nWouldn't the following code work fine?\nts\n@Cordova({\n  observable: true,\n  destruct: true\n})\non(eventName: string): Observable<any> { return; }. @wf9a5m75 \nI understand. But the @Cordova decorator can convert callbacks to Promise or Observable. We just have to omit the sync: true option. \nIf you'd like, I can take this PR from here. It looks good to go as-is, I will try to make some optimizations and see what I can change. . @wf9a5m75 \nCordova and CordovaInstance work the same way. The only difference is:\n- Cordova applies method calls to the plugin's pluginRef\n- CordovaIntance applies method calls to this._objectInstance. @wf9a5m75 \nGreat!\nI'll clone the repos and check them out soon.. @perrygovier would have to approve this change since it's site related.. Just merged another PR that adds this. . Just pushed a commit to fix this... @CordovaFunctionOverride is cleaner, the name of the method was just wrong.. Doesn't seem like an issue with Ionic Native, please confirm by replacing this:\nts\nthis.webIntent.startActivity(options).then(onSuccess, onError);\nwith this:\nts\nWebIntent.getPlugin().startActivity(options).then(onSuccess, onError);. This PR is too messy to review/merge.. @Julieng50 I don't think Ionic View has the latest version of the plugin installed. Ionic Native uses google-maps v2.0. Please update the PR title and description. \"Update index.ts\" doesn't explain what this PR is supposed to change.. Please update the PR title and description. \"Update index.ts\" doesn't explain what this PR is supposed to change.. pluginRef is the reference to the plugin's object on window. Which is cordova.plugins.market in this case. . Please provide me with a link to verify these changes. PRs/commits/changelogs/docs would work.. The docs already explain this step.. The docs already explain this.. The docs already explain this.. The docs already explain this.. Thanks @rapropos . @flowli this PR was published in 4.2.0 https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/releases/tag/v4.2.0. Instead of this:\n```ts\n      this.deviceAccounts.getEmail()\n        .then(account => console.log('Account' + account)) // Guy, double your hustle, not working.\n        .catch(error => console.error(error)); // So, sorry for you. Not working.\n  this.deviceAccounts.get()\n    .then(accounts => console.dir(accounts)) // No output. DOA\n    .catch(error => console.error(error)); // No output\n\n```\nCan you try this:\n```ts\n      DeviceAccounts.getPlugin().getEmail(\n        account => console.log('Account' + account),\n        error => console.error(error));\n  DeviceAccounts.getPlugin().get(\n   accounts => console.dir(accounts),\n   error => console.error(error));\n\n```\nIf it doesn't work, then this is an issue with the plugin & not Ionic Native. . @flowli no, it will be published soon. Tonight, or tomorrow.. The warning you included doesn't explain much. Can't tell what's the unmet peer dependency. But my guess is that one of your angular packages is 4.2.1 while the rest are still 4.1.3. It shouldn't be an issue anyways, and it's most likely not related to Ionic Native.\nClosing this issue, but if you believe this is an Ionic Native issue and you have more details, let me know and I'll take a look.. This is the wrong place to ask this question as it's not related to Ionic Native. I suggest you seek help at the Ionic forums. \nYou should be able to use the same way you do anywhere else. \nMy personal advice: convert your plugin to an Angular component/directive and then use it in your Ionic app. jQuery doesn't perform that well on mobile based on my personal experience. . @felixbroehl you can use Ionic Native v5 .. it works with Ionic 2 :) \nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/tree/v5\nYou can test it out by using this plugin only:\nnpm i --save @ionic-native/core@beta @ionic-native/index-app-content@beta\nts\n// Replace this:\nimport { IndexAppContent } from 'ionic-native';\n// with this:\nimport { IndexAppContent } from '@ionic-native/index-app-content';. @felixbroehl \n\nIf you're still using Ionic 2.x, then you need to upgrade to Ionic Native v5 (under @beta tag).\nAre you waiting for platform.ready() before calling the plugin?. Could you please provide a use-case for this plugin?. May I suggest you use CloudFlare to proxy your server? This will allow you to keep your self-signed certificate, and cover it with a layer of a trusted SSL.. The ionic-native package is for Ionic Native 2.x only ... If you wish to use versions greater than 3.x, you need to start using the @ionic-native/ scope. \n\nPlease follow the latest docs for instructions.. You can use the @CordovaFunctionOverride decorator. See example: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/00c0707dad4fc98974ae2e8c3d720c7a7521e968/src/%40ionic-native/plugins/geofence/index.ts#L98\nSorry the decorator is not documented yet!. @NiklasMerz it should be working, yes. I will test it soon and apply any fixes if necessary.. @NiklasMerz Found the issue, just pushed a commit to fix it. Update to the latest @ionic-native/core and it should be resolved. (Publishing it now, should be live in a few minutes). They stopped development/maintenance only.. the plugin is still functional. The plugin wrapper can stay as-is, we can add a deprecation notice.. The callback indexes are needed because we have an optional parameter. They are correct and do not need to be removed.

You can edit the PR and only include the docs update, or close this.. Oh I see. Sorry I didn't notice that earlier. I will take another look soon.\nRegards,\nIbby Hadeed\nSent from my phone\nOn Dec 9, 2017 8:28 AM, \"Vlado Velichkovski\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nLast time i tried this without this patch, it gave me very strange results\nboth when i have and do not have a value for namespace...\nLook at the code in plugin... it says if you do not provide namespace then\nerror = success, success = namespace and that is index 1 and 2 and not 2\nand 3 anymore\nexports.setDefaults = function (defaults, namespace, success, error) {\n    var args = [defaults];\n    if (typeof namespace === 'string') {\n        args.push(namespace);\n    } else {\n        error = success;\n        success = namespace;\n    }\n    exec(success, error, \"FirebasePlugin\", \"setDefaults\", args);\n};\nI remember that in that case i got success response in error callback.\nP.S: i already use this patch in apps that is in production, and they are\nworking perfectly\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/2032#issuecomment-350466595,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANJ8dNqn0sZsiHEmPKeBtNCSan9aV8POks5s-osHgaJpZM4Py0PK\n.\n. A promise should work fine. The @Cordova decorator will pass the resolve callback of the promise to the plugin as a callback parameter. It should work as if you passed an actual function.\n\nCan you confirm that this works:\n```ts\nimport { InAppPurchase2 } from '@ionic-native/in-app-purchase2';\nInAppPurchase2.getPlugin().ready(() => console.log('Callback called'));\nand this doesn't:ts\nimport { InAppPurchase2 } from '@ionic-native/in-app-purchase2';\n...\nconstructor(private iap: InAppPurchase2) {}\n...\nthis.iap.ready()\n  .then(() => console.log('Ready resolved'));\n```. @bshafiee \nPlease note that I just edited the code samples. I misplaced one line of code.\nIf both of the code samples I provided don't work, then the issue is not from the wrapper.. Make sure you're waiting for deviceready to fire (via an event listener, or use Platform.ready) .. if you call the ready method of the plugin before the plugin is fully loaded, then the callback will not be registered.\nExample:\n```ts\nimport { InAppPurchase2 } from '@ionic-native/in-app-purchase2';\nimport { Platform } from 'ionic-framework';\nclass MyComponentOrService {\nconstructor(private iap: InAppPurchase2, private platform: Platform) {}\nasync someMethod() {\n    await this.platform.ready();\n    await this.iap.ready();\n    console.log('Ready resolved')\n  }\n}. - InAppPurchase2.getPlugin() gets the original plugin object without wrapping it with Ionic Native. \n- Did you try this.iap.ready() AFTER deviceready event has fired? (or this.platform.ready() resolved). @tobika passing extra parameters to a function doesn't hurt. If the original ready function is only expecting one param, then the second one will be omitted. . This PR has a mistake. The finish method is missing the decorator option: callbackOrder: 'reverse'. Just pushed a commit to fix it. \nPlease update @ionic-native/push to version 4.5.2. (Publishing now, will be live in ~3 minutes). Isn't this the same thing as the getLocaleName method in the Globalization plugin?. I think this plugin should be renamed to IOSDocumentPicker to reflect that it's an iOS specific plugin.. Sorry about that, I didn't realize that modules compiled with @angular/compiler-cli@5.0.0 are not compatible with @angular/*@4.x.x. Please downgrade your Ionic Native dependencies to version 4.3.3 for now, or upgrade your Angular version. Hopefully we'll have a better solution in the next release.. Please upgrade your Ionic Native dependencies to 4.4.2. Sorry about that, I didn't realize that modules compiled with @angular/compiler-cli@5.0.0 are not compatible with @angular/*@4.x.x. Please downgrade your Ionic Native dependencies to version 4.3.3 for now, or upgrade your Angular version. Hopefully we'll have a better solution in the next release.. Please upgrade your Ionic Native dependencies to 4.4.2. ```shell\nOption 1: update them via CLI, list all Ionic Native package names\nI think there's a shortcut if you're on mac/linux to upgrade the whole @ionic-native scope.\nnpm i --save @ionic-native/core@latest @ionic-native/camera@latest \nOption 2:\nEdit package.json and bump all Ionic Native versions to 4.4.2\nThen run this in terminal:\nnpm update\n``. Sorry about that, I didn't realize that modules compiled with@angular/compiler-cli@5.0.0are not compatible with@angular/*@4.x.x. Please downgrade your Ionic Native dependencies to version4.3.3for now, or upgrade your Angular version. Hopefully we'll have a better solution in the next release.. Please upgrade your Ionic Native dependencies to4.4.2. Please upgrade your Ionic Native dependencies to4.4.2. Use 4.4.2.. Version 4.4.1 was unpublished.. Are you importingFilefrom@ionic-native/file`? \nIf you don't import anything, it should use the dom library's File interface.. Sounds like an issue with webpack.. it's assuming that your other reference to File is from Ionic Native as well. \nYou can use window.File but I don't think that will work since the file plugin overrides the global File variable.\nOut of curiosity, why are you trying to use the native File class/interface while using the native plugin? . \n. Sorry I didn't see your PR earlier. I just made this change.. It doesn't make sense to include this type of documentation to each plugin manually. The current docs template already includes instructions similar to this. . What version of Angular do you have?. > Plugin doesn't support this project's cordova-android version. cordova-android: 6.2.0, failed version requirement: >=6.3.0\nMake sure you're using the correct platform version.. @vandres you can still use the plugin as-is. Cordova team is just not going to take care of any issues or updates from this point.\nAFAIK they maintain plugins until their API becomes part of the web. In this case, the contacts API will never have a web API because of privacy issues; therefore, they're discontinuing the project immeadieatly. \nAt this point I'd keep an eye out for a new maintained fork, or an alternative plugin. . If you get a warning saying that the plugin requires a higher version of @ionic-native/core, then you should update all your plugins (including the core package) to the same (or latest) version. We update the peer dependency of @ionic-native/core when there's a required update in that package. . @andrefa @bradleyDean the package has been renamed to @ionic-native/file-transfer . This is an issue with the plugin, please file an issue @ their repo.. You have two options for events:\nts\n@Cordova({\n  eventObservable: true,\n  event: 'chcp_updateIsReadyToInstall'\n})\nonUpdateIsReadyToInstall(): Observable<any> { return; }\nOr you can do a manual function on(eventName: string) that returns an observable & subscribes to the event. . Not sure if that's a good idea, that would basically allow anyone to publish anything they want under the @ionic-native scope.\nYou can test plugins by:\n1. Using npm link\n2. OR, copy & paste the generated directory under dist to node_modules/@ionic-native in your app. number | string can work when you have an interface defining a parameter (write-only usage) .. it causes issues when having a read/write or read-only interface. \nExample:\nIf you try to do value.toUpperCase() .. the IDE/Compiler will say that toUpperCase does not exist on type number. . Here's another example of what I mean,  hopefully it will make sense:\nts\ndownload()\n  .subscribe((value: ProgressMessage) => {\n    // TypeScript isn't sure whether `value` is a string or a number unless if we explicitly set the type\n    // if we explicitly set the type, I don't see a point of having a type in the first place. \n  });. I think you need to do (value as string).toUpperCase() or (value as number).toExponential() to avoid TS issues.. Seems like an issue with the plugin and not with Ionic Native.\nIonic Native problems might cause errors to be displayed in the console.. it won't crash your app.. Never mind, plugin doesn't work.. @thanapongp yes it's a security thing. \nWhen you run in livereload, you're loading a site on the http:// protocol. Chrome & Chrome WebView (and I think other browsers) block access to sensitive APIs (such as Geolocation) over insecure connections. When you run the app without livereload, you're accessing it via file:/// protocol, which is considered secure, since the data isn't being transmitted anywhere. . Is this plugin even popular? hard to find data since it's a paid plugin with no public code & low download count.. I don't have any trouble sending SMS without adding n at the beginning, but I've only tested this with local 10 digit numbers that do not begin with a 0.\nIf this is an issue with numbers that begin with a 0, then the docs should let people know that this is a quirk with those type of numbers. . Hey everyone ..\nTo upgrade from v4 to v5, you need to add /ngx at the end of each package name. For example:\n```ts\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\n// becomes this:\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera/ngx';\n```\nIf you import without ngx you will just get a static class that you can use right away without injecting:\n```ts\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\nCamera.getPicture()\n``. Good catch, thanks!. thanks. thanks. thanks!. Let me know when https://github.com/auctifera-josed/starprnt/pull/11 is merged and I'll take another look at this PR.. Good catch ... we were callingget(window, element)but not assigning the value toelement`. \nThanks. @AmitMY you need to import it from /ngx like this:\nts\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera/ngx';\nWithout /ngx you are importing an instance of the plugin. Which you can call methods on directly like Camera.getPicture(). You can't create custom plugins within your app the same way as before. You can do one of the following:\n\nClone the repo, write your plugin & compile it\nImport the underlying functions from @ionic-native/core and use them to proxy your calls. If you look at the compiled JavaScript code you will see how it works. Here are a few examples:\n\n```ts\n// Before\nimport { Cordova, Plugin } from '@ionic-native/core';\n@Plugin({\n  plugin: 'cordova-plugin-myplugin',\n  pluginRef: 'cordova.plugins.myplugin',\n  ... // rest of plugin opts\n})\nexport class MyPlugin {\n  @Cordova({ \n     ... // function proxy opts\n   })\n  someFunction(arg1, arg2) {};\n}\n// After\nimport { IonicNativePlugin, cordova } from '@ionic-native/core';\nexport class MyPlugin extends IonicNativePlugin {\n    static plugin = 'cordova-plugin-myplugin';\n    static pluginRef = 'cordova.plugins.myplugin';\n    ....     // rest of plugin opts\nsomeFunction(arg1, arg2) {\n   return cordova(this, 'someFunction', { ... /* function proxy opts */}, [arg1, arg2]);\n}\n\n}\n```. You cannot create Ionic Native plugin wrappers like that. See #2927 . @DRPC1996 two options:\n\nfork the repo, add a plugin, and compile it from there\nwrite plugin wrappers similar to the compiled Ionic Native code; example:\n```ts\nimport { cordova, IonicNativePlugin } from '@ionic-native/core';\n\nexport class MyPlugin extends IonicNativePlugin {\n  // @Plugin args go here as properties\n  pluginName = 'MyPlugin';\nsomeMethod(arg1, arg2) {\n    // @Cordova decorator args go to this cordova method (3rd arg)\n    return cordova(this, 'someMethod', {}, [arg1, arg2]);\n  }\n}\n``. this should bepluginRef: 'window.imagePicker'`\n. No problem :smile: \n. This will handle the plugin's main supported platforms\n. and this will take care of platform specific methods\n. Shouldn't it be something like this? \njs\n@Cordova({\nsuccessIndex: 1,\nerrorIndex: 3\n})\nstatic open(email: email, scope : any) : Promise<any> {return}\n. js\n@Cordova()\nstatic isAvailable() : Promise<boolean> {return}\n. Remove this line as it's not needed. export * takes care of this\n. No need to return a promise manually. Also the original plugin doesn't have Promise support.\nThe @Cordova decorator overrides your function anyways. So this will still work. But you should replace the return here and below with just return;. \nThe original plugin usage is: \nisAvailable(callback)\n. Replace the whole return statement with just return; . See comment above.\n. This line exports everything in inappbrowser.ts\nI highly doubt that replacing this with individual imports & exports would make a difference.\n. this function should be:\ntypescript\n@Cordova()\nstatic init(appId: string, options: { ... }): Promise<any> {return; }\nSo just take out object?: any and set the return type to a promise, and add a return; to avoid any TypeScript errors. \nThe @Cordova() decorator would generate that promise, and attach the resolve to the third paramter automatically. \n. Having @Cordova() decorator without any configuration assumes the function has successCallback and errorCallback as the last 2 parameters. This means that it will attempt to return a promise when this function is invoked.\nThis should be @Cordova({ sync: true }) which means that it will call the function and return back the result as-is. \n. Same here, should be @Cordova({ sync: true })\n(Read previous comment above)\n. Same here, should be @Cordova({ sync: true })\n(Read previous comment above)\n. Should be @Cordova({ sync: true })\n(Read previous comment above)\n. Should be @Cordova({ sync: true })\n(Read previous comment above)\n.

Should be @Cordova({ sync: true })\n(Read previous comment above)\n. Should be @Cordova({ sync: true })\n(Read previous comment above)\n. this can be only plugins.sim\nIonic native automatically adds window.\n. Shouldn't we do something like this:\ntypescript\nlet secureStorage = new secureStorage();\nsecureStorage.init().then(()=>{ // it's ready }).catch(()=>{ // something wrong });\n. this is unecessary now\n. @marcinwadon This is how I designed the CordovaInstance decorator to work. To change this we would have to modify the other plugins. We can keep this for now and maybe modify all the plugins later.\n. this probably needs : clearWithArgs: true as well. \n. This is the name that appears in the docs. We want to keep the spacing in between the words.\n. What are those extra docs for?\n. @danbucholtz Already fixed! \n. window. is not needed\n. Public is not needed as it is the default\n. import/export statements are arranged by alphabetical order, please move this and the rest of the import/export statement to the appropriate place\n. This can be rewritten to this:\ntypescript\n@Cordova({\n  observable: true,\n  successIndex: 0,\n  errorIndex: 3 // we don't need this, so we set it to a value higher than # of args, merge with latest master for this to work\n})\nstatic sync(syncOptions?: SyncOptions, downloadProgress?: Function): Observable<any> { return; }\nI think the syncCallback is the important callback so we are wrapping that, the progress callback can stay as an optional param.\n. Add some basic usage docs please \n. replace this with declare var window: any;\n. Missing description\n. thanks @Manduro I'll get that fixed\n. why the .tmpl extension \n. No need for successCallback and errorCallback here. \nUsing the @Cordova() decorator with no options will automatically add these callbacks at the end of the arguments list and link them to a promise. See developer guide for more details.\nSo the correct line here would be:\nstatic scan(options: ZBarOptions): Promise<any> { return; }\n. Remove this.\n. Remove this.\n. Document what each property represents here (use the information you have in the @advanced tag)\n. After fixing the method below (by returning a promise), edit the usage to something like:\nZBar.scan(zBarOptions).then(result => { ... }).catch(error => { ... });\n. Not sure why I haven't noticed it before. This was added by the IDE.\n. This should return a Promise.\nThe decorator should include the following options:\n@Cordova({\n  callbackStyle: 'object',\n  successName: 'success',\n  errorName: 'failure'\n})\nThen finally remove the callbacks parameter.. This should return a Promise.\nThe decorator should include the following options:\n@Cordova({\n  callbackStyle: 'object',\n  successName: 'success',\n  errorName: 'failure'\n})\nThen finally remove the callbacks parameter.. Can you add a return type : Promise<any> to this function. Also keep { return; } all in the same line.\nThanks.. Here is an example of how it should look like: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/camera.ts#L201\nThe docs are fine, just need to add a TypeScript return type of Promise<any>.. You also need to remove successCallback?: Function, errorCallback?: Function. The @Cordova() decorator will automatically apply resolve and reject of the promise to these arguments.\nSorry I didn't mention this earlier.. Should be:\nstatic setUp(autohide?: boolean = false): Promise<any> { return; }. Remove this line and add: \n@return {Promise<any>}. Need to add return; between the curly brackets to avoid TS Errors.. add @returns {Promise<any>}. this line is not needed since we do not have a custom install command for this plugin. Might be a good idea to return an observable here.\ntypescript\n@Cordova({\n  observable: true\n})\nstatic addEventListener(eventName: string): Observable<any> { return; }. just had a look\nIt should be plugins.headerColor . Yes you're right. This is missing: https://github.com/cranberrygame/cordova-plugin-navigationbar/blob/master/www/navigationbar.js#L12. you're right.. it is navigationbar . A promise resolves once, an observable can fire as many times as you want until you unsubscribe from it.\nIt should also have the following decorator instead of just observable: true, this will make sure we unsubscribe from the event when unsubscribing from the observable:\n@Cordova({\n  observable: true,\n  clearFunction: 'removeEventListener',\n  clearWithArgs: true\n}). No you don't need to add the removeEventListener. The @Cordova decorator will do the magic needed once you add the options I mentioned in my last comment.. Adding the clearFunction option will call that function when you unsubscribe from the observable. The clearWithArgs option will pass the same arguments passed to addEventListener (which are needed in this case).. The changes to this file should be removed from this PR.. remove the comments in the 3 lines above. Could you please add @beta tag above this line? The plugin seems very new and the performance might not be guaranteed.. Prefix this interface with Gyroscope. add docs for each property. remove empty lines between docs and method/interface name. instead of this:\nsuccessIndex: 0,\nerrorIndex: 1\nYou can have the following:\ncallbackOrder: 'reverse'. There shouldn't be any spaces here. pluginName should match the class name.. the plugin property should be https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase-Lite-PhoneGap-Plugin since they don't have an NPM package pubished. instead of manually writing the function, you can add the following decorator:\ntypescript\n@Cordova({\n  eventObservable: true,\n  event: 'onInterstitialLoaded'\n}). This is basically  the package to install. It should be https://github.com/appodeal/appodeal-cordova-plugin since they don't have an NPM package.. Do you think it's not working because the decorator listens to events on window instead of document?\n~I can modify the decorator to accept an additional property element that is set to window by default. That can be set to document in this case. I think other plugins can benefit from this change.~\n~I will also use Observable.fromEvent instead of hard coding it.~\n. Never mind, this is fine. The decorator doesn't do much here anyways. Just review the other comment I left and I think the rest is ok.. This decorator should be:\n@Cordova({\n  successIndex: 3,\n  errorIndex: 4\n}). Adding default values wont make a difference since the method will be overwritten by the decorator.. can you add platforms: ['iOS'] to both methods? just below sync: true. Overloads need a @private tag so they don't confuse the doc generator. Add the function docs above the @Cordova decorator.. Decorators should be placed in src/plugins/plugin.ts. Documentation for interfaces should look like this:\nexport interface QueryOptions { \n   ...\n   /**\n   * The data type to be queried\n   */\n   dataType: string;\n   ...\n}\nEach property needs to have its definition right above it, there is no need to have the type there as it's defined in the typings and the doc generator is able to read that. \n. install: '' should be removed. This should be:\n@return {Promise<any>}. Extra lines like this one should be removed. callbackStyle: 'node' is used incorrectly here. It's not needed.\ncallbackStyle: 'node' is used when the plugin expects a callback like this one:\nfunction(err, result) { }. Remove callbackStyle: 'node' from here too. See comment above.. This large block of documentation is not necessary. It won't be visible on the site anyways.\nWe can add a link in the main documentation block telling people to visit the plugin's repo to learn more about the valid data types. Or this table can be under @advanced tag. Example:\n/**\n* @name PluginName\n* @description ...\n* @usage ...\n* @advanced\n* Put the table here \n*/. All of this should be removed: \n{type: function()}, called if the function was called\n     * errorCallback: {type: function(err)}, called if something went wrong          * errorCallback: {type: function(err)}, called if something went wrong\nAll what it needs is @return {Promise<any>} \nYou can add additional description such as: \n@returns {Promise<any>} returns a promise that resolves when (something happens) and rejects if (something else happens).. .then(() => []) should be .then(() => {}). This should be:\ntypescript\n@Cordova({\n  callbackOrder: 'reverse'\n})\nstatic connect(name: string): Promise<any> { return; }\nMake sure to remove the documentation for the fnSuccess and fnError params.. Adding @Cordova() decorator will take care of success and error callbacks. You need to:\n\nremove all parameters\nremove all docs for the params\nset return type to Promise<any> instead of void.. Same as previous comment. Same as my first comment. Needs callbackOrder: reverse and  the other mentioned edits.. Same as my first comment. Needs callbackOrder: reverse and  the other mentioned edits.. Same as my first comment. Needs callbackOrder: reverse and  the other mentioned edits.. Same as my first comment. Needs callbackOrder: reverse and  the other mentioned edits.. Please resubmit PR without  any modifications to this file health.ts. You need to merge your branch correctly with master branch.\n\nAlternatively, you can copy your edits into a new branch based on master.. Please replace this usage block with actual usage example.\nAlso, I notice you're using the old template from Ionic Native 2.x.\nUsage should look like:\n```typescript\nimport { JinsMeme } from '@ionic-native/jins-meme';\nconstructor(private jinsMeme: JinsMeme) { }\n...\nthis.jinsMeme.functionName()\n  .then(...)\n  .catch(...);\n```\nSee how other plugins are documented.. Package name should be @ionic-native/jins-meme. Name should be Jins Meme with a space between the two words. Remove this line since there is no custom install command needed. Remove the documentation beside this line, and the following 3 lines.. Remove this comment. Add:\n* @returns {Observable<any>}. Remove white-space before this comment block, apply to other occurrences as well.. All methods should not be static. Please remove the static keyword from all methods below.. I prefer if this commit is removed from the PR. \nIdeally a PR should be to modify/add one thing.. Add the following decorator for this method:\ntypescript\n@CordovaCheck({\n  observable: true\n})\nThis will ensure that the plugin is installed and available before attempting to run your custom code. CordovaCheck should be imported from @ionic-native/core. Remove white-space between <any> and ((observer.... You can add another @Plugin() tag here with a different pluginRef and no repo property. You can also make it injectable if you think that's a better way to do it.\nIf you make it Injectable. Then the class above should be empty and only used for documentation purposes. \n\nApply this fix to the class below as well.. After making the changes I mentioned above, you can remove the if (!window.intel) ... check and add the regular @Cordova decorator.\nApply this fix to all methods below.. Missing @usage tag. could you please specify the return type for each method?\nExample:\n/**\n * Is this plugin supported?\n * @return {Promise<void>}\n */. Since now we have the Cordova decorator, there is no need to write any functionally. We can just have the keyword return in there.\nIf the real method takes an object as a parameter instead of a string, then we need to change the parameter type in the method definition/docs.. Move all the @usage documentation to the main @usage block in the class documentation. \nThe usage here will not be rendered in the docs page.\nPlease apply this fix to all methods below. Simply cut & paste them above.. Rename this to ZeroConfService. I liked the interface better than having the params listed below.. Remove these 5 lines as they are not needed.. remove the repo property completely.. Add the following\n* @classes\n* IntelSecurityData \n* IntelSecurityStorage. Replace all @Cordova() decorators with @Cordova({ otherPromise: true }).\nI just realized their plugin returns a promise instead of using callbacks. This decorator config will convert their Q promise to a regular ES6 Promise.. Sorry, forget about the changes regarding the capitalization of the name.\nI assumed ZeroConf is a brand name since the plugin repo has it written in that way. I traced this thing down to this page: http://www.zeroconf.org/ and realized it's called Zeroconf.\nI will delete the other comments below.. Yes this should be changed in the BLE plugin and any other similar occurrences. All usage should stay in the main @usage block in the class documentation.\nThanks!. Yes you're right.\nFYI, in cases where we have brand names that need to be capitalized. We capitalize the class name but keep the package name as one word. You can see this in OneSignal, PayPal, SQLite .. etc. Remove all functionality here, just leave return;.\nThe @Cordova decorator overrides any functionality you put here.\nApply to other occurrences below.. Add @returns {Promise<any>}.\nApply fix to all other occurrences below.. Since we have an optional parameter, we have to specify successIndex and errorIndex. You can do that by replacing the decorator with this:\nts\n@Cordova({\n  successIndex: 2,\n  errorIndex: 3\n})\nApply this fix to other occurrences below. Change the indices if needed.. @param params is optional\nshould be:\n@param [params] {Object} parameters\nAdding [ and ] around the name makes it optional. Also, the type is missing here. \nApply fix to other occurrences below.. Remove this * Optional parameters comment. The optional iOS only documentation should be stated above the parameter (preferably along with some description). Just like the way you have it in the interface above.. Remove the question mark here as this option is required.. This is not needed:\n{\n  successIndex: 0,\n  errorIndex: 1\n}\nThe @Cordova() decorator alone is sufficient. . Move this to the @usage block above, where ever you think makes sense. this line is not needed. Keep all usage examples in the main block above the @Plugin decorator. Do not add any usage documentation above the method declaration.. This method should not have callbackOrder: 'reverse'. See https://github.com/fechanique/cordova-plugin-fcm/blob/master/www/FCMPlugin.js#L8. This method should not have callbackOrder: 'reverse'. See https://github.com/fechanique/cordova-plugin-fcm/blob/master/www/FCMPlugin.js#L12. Would it work if we set the type to Contact? . You need to remove this decorator because it will override the functionality you wrote. Remove the close() method from here. It's an instance method, you already got it in PLNObject.\nSee https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-local-notification/blob/master/www/notification.js#L80. Got a typo here.. Loca -> Local. remove comment. Name needs to be Phonegap Local Notification ... also directory name should be phonegap-local-notification. According to the docs it only accepts string. https://github.com/apla/me.apla.cordova.app-preferences/blob/master/www/apppreferences.js#L138-L139. Ok looks like the value can be anything, since they run it through JSON.stringify(). But the key has to be a string.. There is no need for this\nts\n{\n +    successIndex: 2,\n +    errorIndex: 3\n +  }. I think instead of ionic info we can ask for a copy of the packages installed in package.json. This way we know what versions of @ionic-native/* are they using.. The docs above need to be updated as well to reflect this change. ~Replace this block of code with:~ Never mind this comment, read the next comment below\nts\nconst availabilityCheck: any = checkAvailability(SecureStorage.getPluginRef(), null, SecureStorage.getPluginName());\nif (availabilityCheck === true) {\n  const instance = new cordova.plugins.SecureStorage(...); // same code as above\n} else {\n  rej(availabilityCheck.error);\n}. Sorry forget about the comment above, here's a better way to do it:\nts\n@CordovaCheck()\ncreate(): Promise<SecureStorageObject> {\n  return new Promise<SecureStorageObject>((resolve: Function) => {\n    const instance = new cordova.plugins.SecureStorage(...);\n  });\n}\nThe @CordovaCheck() decorator will make it only run if the checkAvailability passes, and it will automatically reject with the error if it exists.. This should be User Agent without the dash in between. Was this automatically generated by the gulp plugin:create command?. Please add spaces between the import names and the brackets. A space after { and a space before }.. This should stay as cordova only. \ncordova.base64ToGallery is a function, not an object. Our wrapper wouldn't work unless if the pluginRef is set to cordova.. Any specific reason  for adding the .git prefix here (and other occurrences below) ?. This install line is not needed since the plugin doesn't require any variables.. no need to have window. here... plugins.Base64 is sufficient . This line should read:\n* @param {string} filePath Absolute file path. Remove blank JSDoc line here. All usage examples should stay at the top, in the @Plugin() decorator's doc section.. The params are documented as optional, but the method signature defines them as mandatory. Please remove the brackets.. Capitalize the word android.. Remove empty lines. Refrain from using @see and @link tags. They are not supported here. You can use  Markdown to link to external resources if you need to.. Since the plugin only supports Android platform, there is no need to define this here as well. . The config passed to @Plugin() indicates that Android is the only supported platform.. Remove the @CordovaIntance decorator from the getMap methods.\nCordova, CordovaInstance, CordovaProperty and InstanceProperty decorators override your custom definition. Since you are defining your own functionality here, you have to remove the decorators. . Perhaps we could use : T[] | any to indicate that we can pass an array of the same type, or any (BaseArrayClass instance).. This is not needed since we don't have variables anymore.. I see that you've removed some decorators. I suggest you replace them with CordovaCheck and InstanceCheck decorators. These two decorators check if the plugin/objectInstance exists before executing the functionality. This helps eliminate runtime errors when we're developing outside of a Cordova platform.\nTo use the decorators, you have to give them a configuration that specifies what to return in case Cordova is not available. You can return an empty promise, empty observable, or null. \nts\n@CordovaCheck() // returns promise\n@CordovaCheck({ observable: true }) // returns observable\n@CordovaCheck({ sync: true }) // returns `null`. This is not needed. declare const window: any;. Please remove the usage block from here. This will not be displayed in the actual docs. You should document the method in the JSDoc of the class.. Never mind, the whole file is not formatted properly. I will fix it later.. Should be called DeviceFeedbackStatus @danielsogl. Repo url should be https://github.com/hahahannes/cordova-plugin-google-nearby. This method is not needed. We need getPromise to make Ionic Native work on AngularJS . We should keep launch to maintain backwards compatibility. No need to introduce a breaking change yet.. ",
    "jimthedev": "@ihadeed As far as I can see ionic-native isn't configured to use commitizen. Whenever commitizen encounters a project that doesn't have a commitizen adapter configured (usually done with commitizen init), it falls back to the git default which is to ask you to manually enter a message (using the built in git editor). If you prefer not to use the editor, you can just provide a message to commitizen using git cz -m \"fix(blah): My message here\" and it will do a normal git commit.\n. ",
    "cmanou": "This can be closed since #110 was merged, and 1.2.0 can be released? \n. Hi All, \nThis is working for now though their is an issue with the isAvailable wrapper, since the root call in the cordova plugin the callback \"moves\" arguments depending on whether arguments are supplied, see here\nI don't see an immediate way to do this with the current @Cordova() helper, unless i'm mistaken. What are your opinions on the best way to approach this?\n. @ihadeed decided to go the no wrapper way though, kept it as resolving promise boolean as was the original plugin. Think this is now good to go?\n. Missed that when I looked at the ngCordova docs for the plugin will work on adding this. \nThoughts on whether as first pass we need to implement the overload with the urischeme passed in as well?\n. ",
    "dmackerman": "Personally, implementing the Google Maps JS SDK is super simple. Even more so with NG2 now that we don't have to worry about $digest. I've never understood why you'd want the \"native\" component over just implementing a much more flexible Component with the raw Google JS SDK.\n. ",
    "mlynch": "Would love to expose a native control here if possible!\n. Is the comment style you're using a standard, or are you doing your own thing?\n. @ihadeed basically, is the whole Platforms?: iOS, Android, Windows a standard syntax that a doc tool understands, or would we need to build a doc parser (in dgeni, for example) to handle that?\n. Cool, I'm trying to figure out how we might get those comments that document the actual object into a doc so people can see the params...\n. @keithdmoore done!\n. ah, thanks, should have searched :D\n. @ihadeed it's a good idea. Will that event fire multiple times even if it already happened? I'm getting conflicting info online, the docs say that the callback will happen immediately after the first time but not sure about that. If not, we'd want a global handler and a global ready flag, which might be more performant anyways than binding a listener on each call\n. I did notice the README had an incorrect example of calling unsubscribe. You call it on the return from subscribe not from watchPosition. Updating now...\n. @robwormald yours is definitely a better API approach. Mocking is really not easy with the current library, though Cordova handles browser fallbacks at a lower level so the current approach does gel with that (i.e. the browser platform target). Definitely worth revisiting how it's done currently, in the interest of simplicity the first go at it does nothing more than just statically wrap the cordova calls\n. Had another thought: this is angular 2 specific which is fine in general but the project was meant to be agnostic. Perhaps an ng2 wrapper?\n. It's something we're exploring but haven't started on nor is it on the immediate roadmap. However, we do eventually want to do it.\n. Yea I think wrappers for ng2 and ng1 can do this to expose it. That way we support it \"natively\" for the framework without depending on it?\n. How are you testing currently? Open to ideas on how to do this well, as this is something on the list post 2.0 final of Ionic Framework which we're focused on right now. Quick update: this is happening as we speak and going well. Will be part of the 3.x release. \n. :+1: Good call\n. I think this is what you mean by custom wrapper?\n@ihadeed something like:\nts\n    /**\n     * When a home icon is pressed, your app launches and this JS callback is invoked.\n     * @returns {Observable<any>} returns an observable that notifies you when he user presses on the home screen icon\n     */\n    static onHomeIconPressed(): Observable<any> {\n      return new Observable(observer => {\n        window.ThreeDeeTouch && window.ThreeDeeTouch.onHomeIconPressed = observer.next.bind(observer);\n      })\n    }\n. I know @ihadeed set up the tslint stuff so will let him chime in. However, we are starting to use those rules for all our TS projects so this looks good to me on paper.\n. @ZiFFeL1992 is this the result of running the tslint rules from PR #276?\n. Seems like a useful plugin, but I haven't tested it myself. You have my vote, and those testing and using this plugin can help inform us on whether it's something we should support officially (by fixing the plugin, for example).\n. I say let's merge and we can iterate\n. @saademou to help us, we're going to need to see what error returns, otherwise all I can guess is that you have an error in your SQL statement.\n. Good call, we should do this (surprised we didn't do that from the start...)\n. Looks like a nice improvement. Added a few comments on a few lines. Basically, it needs a simple usage comment and then I was confused by on() feeling like a generic thing that we might want to export as an abstraction for other plugins\n. Let's keep this open to review over time, I don't think we need to make any changes currently\n. Changing this to be a sync since it's a non-standard behavior\n. @pascalrijk can you try the code in master now? Just pushed a fix that changes the semantics to be this:\nBackgroundGeolocation.configure((pos) => {\n}, (err) => {\n}, { // options ))\nAlso updated the config to match the most recent version of the plugin\n. An easier way to install from master: \nnpm install git+https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native.git\n. I just updated the readme with a note about ng1 and observables for now\n. Correct, and with the merged $q fix the promises won't require the apply.\n. That's a weird one since the type is more of an any, and it's regrettable that plugin takes platform-specific arguments.\n. Ah, perhaps the instance based stuff isn't correctly abstracted for ng1...\n. The constructor isn't getting carried over, fixing now\n. Removed that bit since it didn't make sense anyways\n. Looks like the fix for this landed. Ionic docs will update on the next build.\n. We're doing npm only, as this is the way the world is heading.\n. @louisgv apologies, changed my mind. You're right, Ionic 1 relies on this so I went ahead and published it as ionic-native on bower.\n. Yep, Storage is part of Ionic Framework proper.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, will have ibrahim review for the next release\n. Many thanks\n. Thanks!\n. Looks like @ihadeed landed a commit for this\n. Right now you do have to subscribe for the operation to start, which I think is regrettable. Filing an issue now\n. Make sure your ionic.native.js file is included after cordova but before your code\n. @tkem yea I think you're right. Perhaps this is a case where observable is just the wrong return type for Toast\n. I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. If you call a plugin and device isn't ready, what should the response to the plugin be? Should it reject the promise? Should it wait for the result? What are the perf implications of that mechanism?\nThose are my concerns right now...\n. Just added the new methods to this plugin along with a new @CordovaFunctionOverride decorator that handles situations where the plugin author expects developers to override a function in the plugin, like BackgroundMode.onactivate = function() {}. Instead, the plugin wraps that in an observable and handles it for you.\n. Thanks will get on this \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd13\n. Just pushed the latest release to bower and will look into adding this to our release process\n. Cool, we now have npm run publish which will publish to npm and bower. cc @ihadeed\n. Hmm, I don't like adding a variable to IonicNative like that, it feels like the wrong solution to this issue.\nLet me dig in a bit and see if there's a different way to depend on $q...\n. Hey @mattlewis92, thanks for bringing this one up. I believe this is a more appropriate way to solve this as it grabs the injector from the running app properly: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/2dc68a4785b7d9218a0d5bb936efd35cbb554e1b\nLet me know what you think.\n. @tomgallagher the types come from ionic-native, so they will be available for any plugin that we support\n. Thanks @mattlewis92, glad we got to the bottom of this :smile: \n. Awesome. I definitely vote Tree Shaking, I think modularization is going to cause way more friction than it's worth.\nSo, can we target two module formats with tsconfig and output to separate directory? \n. I've got some initial changes in this branch: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/538\nI'm having trouble getting TS to find the rxjs/Observables. To test, run npm run build:esm\n. @dwieeb you dog! That did it \ud83d\udc4d Forgot that\n. Landed in 7f77b8f06944a887c4b6e33593fdf5ef7fcfb3f4. Can you give it a try?\n. Landed in 7f77b8f06944a887c4b6e33593fdf5ef7fcfb3f4\n. Hmm, I'm guessing this is due to the custom bootstrap you're running. It's not straightforward to get the angular1 injector() unless you stick to the standard ng-app. Let me see if I can add another way of grabbing it...\n. @RTK how are you bootstrapping your Angular app?\n. Hmm, I wonder if this is related to moving to a new rxjs import. Also the fact that this uses eventObservable might be where this issue is happening. \n. No worries, taking a look now. Was able to reproduce...\n. Actually, I wasn't able to reproduce this. This works fine for me in the most recent release:\njavascript\n    $cordovaNetwork.onDisconnect().subscribe(() => {console.log('onDisconnect'); alert('onDISCONNECT');});\n    $cordovaNetwork.onConnect().subscribe(() => {console.log('onConnect'); alert('onCONNECT');});\nAm I missing something?\n. Also the object that this returns is a real observable:\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/plugin.ts#L227\n. One thing...you're using ES6 arrow functions which aren't universally supported. Not sure if you're transpiling, but that would certainly keep this from working on, say, iOS \n. Is there a better plugin we can support instead?\n. Thanks! Landed in master\n. Thanks, I think it would be cool to have all calls Just Work, but in the meantime we can tweak the error message.\n. Going to let this one sit for a bit\n. Thanks!\n. I don't think this is true, it's easy to inspect a bundled APK or IPA file and find config.xml to read passwords. You should never store sensitive API keys or passwords on the client, except in the keychain if you must. There they are protected by device level encryption but even then you should keep secrets on the server.\n. Should be fixed, @aljibbs can you try the latest version in master?\n. Thanks @todamach, just added type as an optional param to the master branch\n. Hey @ikarus-balsero, I just pushed some changes to support ES2015 modules along with our commonjs modules. This change was partially to support the next release of Ionic 2 that is going out shortly.\nCan you share the issue you are seeing when you try to import from ionic-native?\nAlso, as for supporting the other BLE plugin, we'd love a PR that adds support for it, then we can let the community decide which one they like best and then pick one. In the meantime I'm happy to have support for both as long as the names keep them separate. \n. There may have been a separate issue that I fixed today, try the newest 1.3.x release (1.3.27) to see that. Going to close for now, looking forward to your PR!\n. I wonder if this is related to moving from typescript 1.8.10 to 2.0.2 https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/7f77b8f06944a887c4b6e33593fdf5ef7fcfb3f4\n. Hey all, please check your typescript version and update to 2.0.x if you haven't. We recently moved so the declaration files now require 2.0. In the meantime we'll check for a better backwards compat solution\n. Okay, I'm reverting my changes that used typescript 2.0, going to publish a fixed 1.3.25, then will publish a 2.0.0 with typescript 2.0. Stand by\n. Okay, fix landed. Can you all try 1.3.25?\n. @nachofregeiro are you seeing the exact issue or are you seeing what @FdezRomero sees? Also try nuking your ionic-native node modules dir first\n. Thanks. So a different issue :D \nAre you guys testing in an Ionic app? If so, what version?\n. thanks, I think I see the issue here, pushing a fix now\n. Okay, I think it's fixed now. can you try 1.3.27?\n. \n. Currently that script uses an old version of typescript. We're going to be rolling out beta.12 this week with some other changes and that supports TS 2.0\n. @PabloFNK is the API the same? i.e. if we just update the plugin we tell people to install, will it Just Work?\n. Thanks, I added the new plugin, mind trying?\n. You got it working? For others: if you're using typescript < 2.0, use 1.3.27, otherwise you can use the 2.0.x release of ionic-native\n. Thanks, duplicate of #551\n. Can you try the most recently release? I tested this and it worked fine on my end, couldn't repro\n. thx \ud83c\udf7e\n. Thanks, I had commented those out for a quick test and they're back in now so I'm going to close this. The export isDebug could be a separate PR if you're up for it, though please explain what it's doing.\n. Thanks will get on that and also need to make this part of the publish process\n. Done, thanks\n. thanks \ud83d\udc83 \n. Yea, I want to avoid people having to call the plugin directly on their own (to verify an issue, for example), and be able to still use the ionic-native class since we're not always 100% up to date w plugin changes\n. Yep, exactly. Will be a nice \"escape hatch\"\n. Pretty simple, figured adding the plugin check wouldn't be appropriate here as that could be annoying. Instead, they can call checkInstall() for a check w/ full error report.\n. Hey John, $cordovaSQLite is a constructor with our plugin, so you'll want to call new on it first. Sounds like we got this figured out and we could be more clear about how this works.\nI'm also going to review whether we need this to be a constructor. Will file a separate issue.\n. Why does it need to be instance based? \n. @vlados try creating a new project w rc0 using ionic CLI to see a plugin or two being used\n. I need specific plugins in order to assess this. I just tested a bunch and they work great. I suspect something else is going on here, perhaps an improperly configured build process with the move to RC.0's build?\nCan anyone share a sample project I can look through? Closing as not reproducible\n``` typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Platform } from 'ionic-angular';\nimport { StatusBar, Device, Splashscreen, GoogleAnalytics, Diagnostic } from 'ionic-native';\nimport { TabsPage } from '../pages/tabs/tabs';\n@Component({\n  template: <ion-nav [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n})\nexport class MyApp {\n  rootPage = TabsPage;\nconstructor(platform: Platform) {\n    platform.ready().then(() => {\n      // Okay, so the platform is ready and our plugins are available.\n      // Here you can do any higher level native things you might need.\n      StatusBar.styleDefault();\n  Splashscreen.hide();\n\n  let name = Device.device.uuid;\n\n  GoogleAnalytics.debugMode();\n  GoogleAnalytics.startTrackerWithId('UA-44023830-11');\n\n  console.log('Device name', name);\n\n\n  let successCallback = (isAvailable) => { console.log('Is available? ' + isAvailable); };\n  let errorCallback = (e) => console.error(e);\n\n  Diagnostic.isCameraAvailable().then(successCallback).catch(errorCallback);\n\n  Diagnostic.isBluetoothAvailable().then(successCallback, errorCallback);\n\n});\n\n}\n}\n``\n. Okay, I think I see what's going on here. We're running into a separate issue with using thename` field I believe.\nDoes it work if you do this:\n``` typescript\nplatform.ready(() => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    Splashscreen.hide()\n}, 1000);\n});\n```\nThe setTimeout is there to test whether htis is just a race condition\n. Can one of you send me your main.js file from www/build/main.js? I think this is a build related issue where the classname is getting renamed. max@ionic.io\n. Hey, in your package.json for your RC0 app, can you try replacing build with this?\n\"build\": \"ionic-app-scripts build --dev\",\nThen try again and let me know if that works? I'm feeling like the prod build is removing metadata we're relying on for this to work.\n. Can someone send me a project with this issue happening? The more I look at the code the more I'm thinking something else is going on, perhaps in your project or with the plugin (maybe it changed?). The console error might be broken but it shouldn't impact anything else because both the plugin window reference and the method name are still intact, and we don't use the name field for anything important.\n. @joubin-ca @baltazaroliveira I'm at a loss. Can either one of you zip up and email me/dropbox/etc. your whole project? max AT ionic DOT io. That would be immensely appreciated! \n. Also, can you try the suggestion here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/651#issuecomment-252485648\nNamely: ionic state reset and then rm -rf node_modules/ then npm install\n. Thanks @shikharls for the test case, we now see it on our end and are digging in. Stand by\n. Okay, I think I figured this one out! Can you all check your www/index.html file, and see if you have this line here:\n\nif you do, please remove it. @shikharls this fixed your app you sent me. Once I removed that line it all worked :D\n. Also @baltazaroliveira check to see if you have that line as per my comment above\n. Hey everyone. Follow up to this, please make sure that the plugin you installed is actually listed in the plugins/ directory. If it's not, please let me know by commenting on this issue, as it might actually be a separate CLI issue. \n. @baltazaroliveira just seeing now that you sent a link for the app bundle, thanks for doing that! I will take a look and see if I can figure out what might be up with GA\n. @baltazaroliveira I fixed the app you sent me. It seemed to be a case of plugins getting in an odd state, which can happen sometimes depending on whether there are build artifacts still in the platform build directories.\nTo fix it:\nrm -rf platforms/\ncordova platform add android\ncordova prepare android\nIf that doesn't work, then remove all the plugins from the plugin directory first, install them again, then follow the steps above.\nConfirmed this is not an issue with ionic-native nor RC\n. Hmm, this should work, did you install the plugin? https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage\n. None of the plugins are injectable so I don't think that's right, as they aren't using any Angular 2 features, it's just a vanilla TypeScript project.. You import from ionic-native. Happy to take a look at your code sample to see what's going on.\n. Interesting, looks like possibly an issue with the package service? Going to close since this doesn't appear related to ionic native itself.\n. Closing as a duplicate of #602 where I show that this plugin indeed works.\n. Hey, I just tested this and it's importing fine for me. Can you share more about your project? Perhaps something I can check out online. Or, how are you importing the project?\nCan you also try doing an npm install to fetch the newest ionic-native before doing the build again?\n. If you run npm show ionic-native version what do you see? You should see 2.1.1\n. Hey guys, what version of @ionic/app-scripts do you have? run npm view @ionic/app-scripts version to see. You should be on 0.0.28, if not do an update (npm install)\n. Can you share a snippet of code where you're using Geolocation and importing from ionic-native?\n. Okay, I can reproduce after referencing it in the code rather than just importing it. Going to revert the last few ionic-native releases to the one that was working with the build.\n. @Bubelbub yep, tests are great. In this case the new releases were not properly exporting symbols in a way that worked with es2015 modules that we use in Ionic 2 so it was a bit of a hard thing to test for.\nEveryone: I just unpublished the last two versions of ionic-native (well, really just one version since 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 were separated by a single commit). if you do an npm install you should get version 2.0.3 which should work. We are looking into publishing the new versions again with this working for the build tomorrow.\nCan someone confirm that 2.0.3 works fine for them? Thanks.\n. Master is broken. 2.0.3 is the only working version currently, and we're aware of the above and working on it, thanks.\n. Looks good at first glance, we can wait for the release after 2.1.2?\n. We're trying to narrow this down. If you wrap this in platform ready and add a setTimeout for a few ms or seconds, does it work?\n. I am guessing this is a duplicate of #602\n. Can you share a screenshot of the console output you see? I'm wondering if this is related to that Class name munging issue I'm trying to track down :(\n. Another data point for adding a version flag to plugins. \n. The docs are here: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/nativepagetransitions/\n. There's a lot more info here: http://plugins.telerik.com/cordova/plugin/native-page-transitions\nTo use that with this Ionic Native class, substitute window.plugins.nativepagetransitions with NativePageTransitions\nNote: this a plugin we don't really recommend at Ionic because ideally you'll just use our NavController for transitions.\n. Then don't use this plugin. Stick with Ionic's NavController: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/navigation/NavController/\nI can see how this would be confusing and I appreciate the feedback. We will look into how we can make this more clear.\n. hmmmmmm, damn. Either way, I think we need to figure out a way forward for people here on this. I'm curious why this hasn't come up before.\nAlso, are you all using the cordova-plugin-geolocation? It should \"skip\" crosswalk and use the native implementation. Let me know\n. Hey, does this work for you guys? seems like crosswalk has settings to work around this, so all is not lost\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/36895310\n. Ignore ionc ionic serve at the moment. If you deploy your app to an iOS device or android device, does it not work?\nIonic serve needs to support https, that's a separate issue\n. Do you have an example of how you're using it?\n. @mbakker96 can you zip up your project directory and email it to me? max@ionic.io\n. @mbakker96 did you see my comment above? Any chance you can share the project w/ me so I can help debug? It's a bit hard to do it remotely, and I haven't been able to reproduce, unfortunately.\n. Okay, I might have figured this out. Can you see my comment here about verifying you have the correct script includes in www/index.html?\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/602#issuecomment-254024940\n. We should talk about how hard work because by we're setting a precedent of a web fallback in ionic native and I want to make sure we go into that with some discussion\n. So, I just tested a project that @mbakker96 sent me with this issue. It worked once I did cordova plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage.\nI think this issue might actually be related to a mixture of #708 where we're bypassing our plugin check logic, and the fact that sqlite isn't going to be available in ionic serve.\nI'm closing for now as can't-reproduce but I think we can fix the other issues somehow.\n. Please remove your plugins and reinstall them. Also, sqlite is not available in ionic serve\n. @h2qutc are you waiting to app AppVersion.getVersionNumber after platform.ready?\n. Thanks for the info everyone. It seems suspect this would only be related to ionic. As a test, can you try going outside of Ionic and doing something like:\njavascript\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function() {\n  window.StatusBar.backgroundColorByHexString('#7c7472');\n}, false). @christocracy we appreciate the feedback but I don't really see what you're getting at here. If you have TypeScript bindings for your plugin, that's awesome...why would anything we're doing here get in the way of that?\nAnyways, if we had your plugins in ionic-native, perhaps we could add a feature whereby the plugin provides its own typings. I'm sure you know that you're in the minority of Cordova plugin authors that provide typings.\nPlus, typings are only one part of the value add for ionic-native, so we're not just trying to replicate @types.\nAnd yes, as @ihadeed mentioned, ionic plugin add is a proxy for cordova plugin add, so we shouldn't be deviating from how Cordova handles your plugins today.\n. Is this not just a limitation of cordova, since cordova plugin add doesn't add the plugin to npm? I'm not sure if we could do much here or on the CLI side to get around this. Perhaps we could add some bundle tweaks so that our app-scripts looks in the plugins directory? My fear is that's non standard.\nAre you able to make this work with a vanilla cordova project?\n. Any chance you could zip up your app and send it to me? max@ionic.io\nI'm having trouble reproducing \ud83d\ude1f\n. This one ended up being duplicate cordova.js includes in the index.html file.\n. This looks like a bug in the OneSignal plugin since ionic-native doesn't impact any config or anything.: https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Cordova-SDK/issues\n. Taking a look\n. Hmm, I just tested your example above and it works fine for me, in the sense that I ran it in the simulator and wired up a button to the testBLE() function which then returned the error in the promise (as expected). My info:\n``` bash\nmax@ionitron:~/apps/VC3$ ionic info\n\n\nYour system information:\nCordova CLI: 6.3.1\nIonic Framework Version: 2.0.0-rc.1\nIonic CLI Version: 2.1.1\nIonic App Lib Version: 2.1.1\nIonic App Scripts Version: 0.0.36\nios-deploy version: 1.7.0\nios-sim version: 4.1.1\nOS: Mac OS X El Capitan\nNode Version: v6.6.0\nXcode version: Xcode 8.0 Build version 8A218a\n\nmax@ionitron:~/apps/VC3$\n```\nTry doing this instead for the build:\nbash\n$ npm run build\n$ cordova prepare ios\nThen open the xcode project and run that from xcode.\n. Closing as a duplicate of #718 as this has nothing to do with Ionic Framework RC versions, but will continue to discussion here to see what's up\n. Sorry I meant #602.\nIt's not an RC issue because Ionic Framework doesn't interact with this module. They are separate, though we did make a lot of changes all the same time for RC0 so people are grouping them together which we're trying to get out of people's heads :D\nSo, in your examples, how are you calling testBLE()? I called mine from a button handler in the template, but if you're calling it before platform ready then it's going to fail\n. Any chance you could zip up the whole directory from your failing side menu example and email it to me? max@ionic.io\n. Thanks. The reason we closed that is we keep finding, in almost every instance, that something else is wrong. That doesn't make it not an issue, it just makes it invalid from a technical standpoint. I'm keeping a very open mind on this though.\n. Ah crap, must by my changes to have an explicit name field. Will change this\n. Merging per @ihadeed's approval, thanks!\n. Thanks! \ud83c\udf7b\n. sqlite is not available in the browser while testing. You'll need to test on a device as it's a native-only feature.\n. This isn't correct. Our implementation exposes configure directly. https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/background-geolocation.ts#L344\nThanks for the contribution, hope to see you around the repo!\n. What's the error message?\n. @frontweb, we already had the open function supported through our decorators. Was that not working? I'd rather use the decorator approach to reduce the code surface area we have to support on top of the plugin. Maybe we just had something misconfigured?\n. Thoughts on this @ihadeed? I'm not fresh on File plugin knowledge\n. Thanks! \ud83c\udf7b\n. Thanks! Will review new plugins for the next non-patch release.\n. Thanks! \ud83c\udf7b\n. This is a limitation with our doc system right now that we're not able to customize the plugin install line. @perrygovier any thoughts on how we could customize that first ionic plugin add [PLUGIN_NAME] to allow plugins to add params?\n. Thanks, lgtm\n. Hi, thanks for the issue. I'm going to close as I don't believe this is an issue with Ionic Native, however we will keep this around as a reference if we see this again...Cheers.\n. Thanks, this looks like an issue that should be filed over at that repo so it can get resolved.. \ud83c\udf89 \n. To be most compatible with URL parsers, we recommend the format pollsapp://app/polls? so \"app\" becomes the hostname. Any console output or anything to help?. Thanks! We are taking a short break for new plugins to ensure quality of existing ones but will revisit this one shortly.. Hi, unfortunately can't provide support on this repo, please post on the forum or stack overflow. Thanks!. Is this on device or simulator?\nOtherwise could be related to our ng1 support. . Thanks, this doesn't look like an actual issue, just a few warning messages not related to ionic-native. We made lots of progress and have separated out modules. More info for the next release. Blessings of the seasons! \ud83c\udf89. Merged this. \ud83d\ude80. For this package, yes, but it's going to be @ionic-native to give more context. . Awesome :D\nCan you remove the prompt text \"Enter value for variable:\", it'll make it cleaner.\n. Thanks, we need to get ngc/AoT in there, haven't gotten to that yet. Just a warning it's all good. It's been fixed anyways \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb. The issue is closed because it seems like the error is not with the plugin but with something else, like airplane mode being on, etc.\nHappy to open it up again if someone can provide more tangible reproduction of a bug in the actual plugin or Ionic Native's wrapper of it.. Leaving this link here in case it helps others test Geolocation on Android: https://blog.ionicframework.com/testing-geolocation-on-android/\n  . Hi all. This is a bug in Cordova. The Geolocation implementation for Android relies on the web view geolocation implementation, but that behavior with Android is broken. The only solution here is for Cordova to add back the native geolocation implementation. We have a discussion going internally about how we might do that, but it also seems that Cordova is not interested in bringing that code back. \nHowever, Capacitor, our new native bridge to replace Cordova, does use the native implementation. Once Capacitor is integrated into Ionic Native, this issue will be resolved.\nUntil then, this plugin will also have that bug. Closing until we have more information.. Thanks, this is soon to not be true so I'm going to close (all plugins will be testable/mockable in the browser after we merge the v3 stuff). Not sure what you're asking. Are you doing a prod build?\nTechnically, your bundle after v3 should be less because there's just less code. Are you sure you aren't still referencing the old ionic-native somewhere?. Thanks, will be fixed in a release shortly. Thanks for the heads up. Is there an announcement anywhere?\nAlso what issue are you seeing now in iOS? I agree this is an important component to have working.. Make sure to add Push to your providers in app.module.ts:\n```typescript\nimport { Push } from '@ionic-native/push';\n// ...\nproviders: [ Push ]\n```\nSee example at the bottom here: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/. Make sure to add the provider to your @NgModule per this example at the bottom: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/. Okay, I see the issue. Our app base is fixing the version, which could keep it from updating it in some cases. @jthoms1 @jgw96 any ideas on making it easy to update but still have this work?. Looks like you're on about the first example, but not the getPicture one. Looks like a bad auto replace on our end. @ehorodyski we still support that through ionic-native 2.x. We just want to focus 3.x and all new work on ionic native going forward for Ionic 2.x+ and Angular 2.x+\nWe will continue to fix and improve 2.x!. Thanks everyone, appreciate the feedback. @theaccordance are you using any ones right now I could take a look at?. @meltuhamy we can't build a business on that so we wouldn't be able to invest in doing this in the first place, so it has to have some level of monthly recurring revenue to make it worth it. I agree it's something badly needed but it's a major effort.. @dpa99c makes sense. Unsure how to do that but it'd certainly be unique. The only downside is that money coming to an author doesn't give them more time to work on it, so it might not actually solve the problem.. Hi all, I forgot to update this thread, but we are working on this right now, in tandem with our new Capacitor project. We are looking for a few larger teams (enterprises, etc.) that are interested in having premium, supported plugins to start. We plan on expanding those plugins for smaller teams and indie developers down the road. These plugins will work in Cordova and Capacitor (they are being built to run in both out of the box).\nInterested? Please send me an email at max@ionicframework.com.\nClosing for now. Cheers!. @selected-pixel-jameson yes, it's MIT licensed. PRs always welcome!. @selected-pixel-jameson here ya go: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native. We didn't refuse to merge it, we're trying to be careful about dependency changes that can break things. It's going to take longer than a week to merge PRs given all the moving parts. We appreciate the contribution and understanding . Unfortunately, even typescript updates can cause unforeseen issues and staying on the latest release of any dependency is not our number one priority (stability is more important in most cases). We prioritize staying in sync with Ionic 2 app base, which is at 2.3.4. We will adjust this soon, once we have the chance to test and confirm there aren't any issues.. @mhartington one question that leaves is how to \"activate\" those. I think we decided we didn't want to use the cordova browser target, so how else would we load these?. That seems like a nice side effect. What about ones that don't have web analogs? What is the calling convention? That's where I start to question this approach.. Leaving this link here in case it helps others test Geolocation on Android: https://blog.ionicframework.com/testing-geolocation-on-android/. Hi, this is not the appropriate place to file issues for Deploy. In the future the best path is to contact support: https://ionic.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\nIf you haven\u2019t contacted support already I\u2019ll ping the appropriate engineer to take a look at the above.. cc @danbucholtz any thoughts on the above? See #2089 for a PR to update deps. Hi @nolanmclark, this doesn't appear to be related to ionic-native. I'd suggest removing each one of those plugins and trying to boot the app. If you do find one causing the crash, we'd love to know which one!\nGoing to close as it pertains to ionic-native.. @DevlprArup we are doing our best, but I hope you understand that it's just not possible for a team of ~30 to provide one-on-one support on a free basis to millions of Ionic developers. Also, I cannot respond to every tweet nor have I ever set that expectation.\nWe can help best through community channels, and in a way that allows others to see the solution when they encounter it again in the future.\nThat's how we can best balance improving the software (which is an incredible challenge), and also help those using it.\n. Hi all, can you try version 4.5.3 of @ionic-native/pro? Both of these issues should be resolved.. Hi all, thanks for the tips here. Can you try version 4.5.3 of @ionic-native/pro? Both of these issues should be resolved.. The project isn't abandoned at all, it's used in every single default Ionic app. We're incredibly busy right now and we don't spend all of our time on ionic-native (though the last release was only 15 days ago). A PR being submitted is incredibly helpful for the community, and we very much appreciate it, but we never guarantee that we'll merge them. \nWe would love to find additional maintainers to focus on the project. If that interests you, please let me know and we can talk about getting you on the repo and our long term plans.. Thanks @darthdie and @joshbabb. I think I got an email from one of you but could you two email me again so we can chat privately about next steps? max@ionicframework.com . I'm not sure, but I will make sure this is easy with Capacitor soon. I see no reason why we can\u2019t put it in a separate repo and manage updates separately and add you as a maintainer @wf9a5m75. Okay I made a new, empty repo here and gave you write access @wf9a5m75: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native-google-maps/\nProbably just need to have @ionic-native/core as a dependency and copy over the tsconfig/typescript deps\nLet me know if I can help, let's continue to conversation here. @wf9a5m75 what's your npm username? Tried wf9a5m75 but it gave me an error. I'll add you as a maintainer of @ionic-native/google-maps, and as for versions, I think you should manage the versions separately, perhaps lock them to the version of your google maps plugin if you desire. . @wf9a5m75 thanks, I think npm has a bug and is throwing a 500. I contacted their support. k Should be resolved and you should have gotten an email notification about being added to the org. Sorry, missed this. Just pinged the team to see about adding Circle CI to that, as that's not something I know how to do. . Thanks, agreed and not sure how that got in there. . What's the purpose of this function? Is this generic and something we could abstract for other plugins?\n. Could you add a quick comment on very basic usage of this? The instance method stuff is a bit new for people and we haven't talked a ton about it.\n. ",

    "ghenry22": "https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/2aa25969f7390fa9a5a23b17dc3d08a00255fa6d\nDoes this commit effectively close this issue?  Just noticed that there was a commit for diagnostic plugin recently and the issue wasn't updated.\n. Any news on the file transfer plugin?\n. I assumed as much, thought it was worth having an issue open for tracking.  I am happy to help testing the media plugin when you get to it.\n. I'll test it out as you suggest and see how it goes.  Will submit a PR if I get it working and tested successfully\nThanks for the quick feedback\n. I have success and error working, returning a promise and have updated the docs in the header with examples on how to use.  Hopefully have status working and updated doc today as well then will put in a PR.\n. I have a fork here with the updates.\nhttps://github.com/ghenry22/ionic-native/tree/fix-%23186\nI get success and error results returned as promises just fine and I have added to the doc in the header comment for these.\nBut no matter what I do I never seem to get anything in the observable.\nI have this code in my app to subscribe to the observable but nothing ever gets logged to the console so I am not sure if I have screwed something up.  Have spent a day looking into it and have no clue at the moment.:\n      this.media.status.subscribe(data => {\n        console.log(data);\n      });\na simple console.log of this.media.status shows me that it is an observable so that seems right.  Just never seem to get any data into it.\n. Cool thanks, I'll try it out over the weekend and update.  I'm happy to write some examples for the docs on the ionic site as well, should I just include this where the current examples are in the comment block in this file or should I submit docs elsewhere?\n. Unfortunately still the same, subscriber never sees any data.  it should see an update when the media plugin moves between states, it's pretty easy to test because changing between paused and playing should trigger status updates between status=2 (playing) and status=3 (paused).\nI have limited time playing with observables unfortunately so it's hard to tell where things are going wrong.\n. I've been working on my app for the last few days and can confirm that the success and error handling is working well on both Android and iOS.\nA couple of quirks worth noting (these are quirks of the media plugin not ionic-native but probably worth noting for people who don't delve below the hood):\niOS\nYou can easily replace an existing media object with a new one and it releases the underlying resource from the old object.\nCreate a media object and start playing\nthis.media.create(src)\nthis.media.play\nThen create a new media object and it replaces the existing one and stops any playback in progress\nthis.media.create(src2) \nThere seems to be no need to call this.media.release()\niOS will trigger the success callback only on completion of playback of the file or stream.\nAndroid\nYou will need to manually release the underlying media resources.  If you follow the iOS example above you will end up with 2 sounds playing and you will only have an object referencing one of them.\nOn android make sure to run this.media.release() when you are done with a media object.\nAndroid will trigger the success callback on release() OR on completion of playback of the file or stream.\n. I'll put in a PR that handles success and error and the notes above, but status is still not getting any updates,  better something than nothing though!\n. PR submitted with updated doc.  Added more comprehensive usage examples.\nI'm not sure that getDuration() and getCurrentPosition() should be async.  I think these should probably sync functions.  They return instantly and it's not like they are doing any heavy lifting, it feels like wrapping them in promises just adds unnecessary complexity.\nI have documented the use of these as currently implemented.\n. @ihadeed - I remember we didn't have status events working with the first implementation with observables but I have no idea why status events weren't being sent/received.  Perhaps you could take a quick look at the code around the status events now that ionic-native has moved along so much it might be something really obvious.\n. best to read up on the media plugin docs for examples and info about where things are stored by default.  To use the ionic-native wrapper just follow the ionic-native docs.  The ionic forums are also a good place for questions.  Commenting on a long closed issue about something else entirely is probably not going to get much response.. That's something that would need to be changed in the cordova plugin itself.  It is not caused by or related to using ionic-native.  Unless there is a good reason for a request to be synchronous then background threading in the native code of the plugin is probably a good idea and you could raise an issue against the cordova statusbar plugin for it and see what they say.\n. Any chance of this getting merged in soon?  I'm waiting on this before implementing file based functionality in my app\n. Media plugin needs to be run on a real device\n. You can use html5 audio tag but it has some trade offs, like background audio in your app may not work on android.  You could write your code though to say if the platform is Cordova use the media plugin, else use html5.  That then depends on your writing create, play, pause etc methods to cater to the differences between the media plugin and the html5 audio API.  It's pretty straight forward but you'd have to consider if it's worth the effort depending on what your target platform is.\nThis ticket could probably be closed as its not an ionic-native issue.\n. just so you know ionic-native is a wrapper for various Cordova plugins so you need to have a supported Cordova platform and device and install the plugin as well as ionic-native.\n. I'll try and give it a test this week\n. The file plugin let's you access files directly within your app.  This lets you open files in the default system.app from.within your app.\nDisplay an image in your app vs\nOpen the image in the native image gallery\nCould be useful.in some scenarios to throw pdf files for example.out to a pdf reader rather than opening them in the app.\n. While I'd love to see this functionality in ionic native, connectSDK seems to be essentially abandoned at this point?\n. I just published a cordova plugin for chromecast on iOS\nhttps://github.com/ghenry22/cordova-plugin-chromecastios\nWorks well for me and I aim to maintain it and continue to implement more features / fixes as best I can.  It's published to npm as well\nI have a fork of the android chromecast plugin you mentioned here:\nhttps://github.com/ghenry22/cordova-chromecast\nI have made some updates and pulled together some updates from forked repos and it is also working well for me currently for the essentials.\nOnce I am happy with the iOS plugin I will look into updating the android one and then ideally merging them into a single plugin with a common javascript interface hiding most of the implementation differences.\n. Like I mentioned I would love to see connectsdk continuing to be supported but it really looks dead.\nI started looking at it when I wanted Chromecast support as well, I found the device detection to be flaky, iOS will detect Chromecast, android won't most of the time, some times it does some times it lists it as a dial device instead and then half the features don't work. I could also not get it to stream any media to the device at all, it always returned an obscure error on load media.\nI also found it to be quite heavy if you just want chrome cast support, it has multiple dependant repositories, downloads and frameworks and if it's not officially supported I didn't think I would be able to maintain it in any usable state over time.\nI agree a single plugin with a common interface would be ideal, but for now there is a solution that works for both android and iOS should you need it.\n. I have implemented full metadata support for different media types on my chromecast plugin for iOS.  It is now pretty much feature complete for using a chromecast from iOS.  I am going to start working on some updates for the android version and then an abstraction layer to try and provide a common interface.  This might be hard as the android and ios implementations are quite different, but let's see how it goes.\n. not yet haven't had time to even start looking at it.\nThere is an android plugin there, you would just have to write yourself a chromecast provider which will handle the 2 different platforms for each required function and you could use the 2 plugins as is.\n. regarding the android chromecast fork it builds fine for me with latest android platform.  Just ran a test project, I have only done minimal testing and merged in a few changes from other forks to the android plugin so I can't gaurantee anything about it.\nThe ios plugin for chromecast works well though.\nre: connectsdk - an ionic native wrapper for this would certainly make it easier to interact with and it already provides a common interface across platforms.  I think if someone could create an example project showing how to use the different connectSDK functions that could serve as a good reference for others and for the ionic-native team to look at putting together a wrapper.\nI may be doing something stupid with connectSDK but I found it very hard just to find chromecast/airplay devices and stream a song, I could be doing something completely wrong though as I know some large projects (plex) were listed as using connectSDK so it can't be completely broken.\n. if connectSDK 1.6 is working well then it would definitely make a great addition to ionic native.  An ionic native wrapper for this with some basic examples and docs would open up airplay and chromecast functionality with a much lower learning curve to cordova developers.  This functionality really isn't there at the moment.\nYou could seperately add my chromecast specific plugin for ios if you wish, it's already promise based so it would be really minimal work.  Unfortunately I am don't really have the time at the moment to refactor the android chromecast plugin and try to merge the 2 into a single plugin.  There is a solid base there for Android though and if anyone wanted to help out with some pull requests against my ios plugin I would gladly merge them in and help out, just don't have the time or android native familiarity to do it all myself.\n. @ihadeed connectSDK seems to be dead in the water, no commits for over a year.  It's also a large and monolithic plugin.  I would suggest closing this issue as I can't see it ever getting merged unless someone else takes over maintenance of the plugin and cleans it up and updates it.. If you are trying to restrict the orientation to portrait, as it looks from the snippet, have you tried just setting orientation in the config.xml?  Alternatively for iOS open up in Xcode and choose the allowed orientations, once done it will stick unless you remove/add platform.\nOr maybe you want it changeable when playing video and then locked when returning to the app? In that case disregard my comment :)\n. Actually getfreediskapace is implemented in the native code but has no JavaScript interface in the plugin itself, been this way forever, you can run a Cordova.exec command to access the native function, this could be implemented in the ionic native wrapper I guess\n. This is all that is required and it could be implemented in the ionic-native wrapper for the getFreeDiskSpace call.  The platform detection is to adjust the returned result to be in a consistent format on both android and ios.\n//file plugin has no js interface to getfreediskspace method\n//use cordova.exec directly to access it.\n  getFreeDiskSpace(): number {\n    var freeDiskSpace: number;\n    cordova.exec(function(result) {\n      //console.log(result);\n      if(isAndroid){\n        freeDiskSpace = (result*1024);\n      }\n      if(isIos){\n        freeDiskSpace = result;\n      }\n      return freeDiskSpace;\n    }, function(error) {\n      //console.log(error);\n    }, \"File\", \"getFreeDiskSpace\", []);\n  }\n. This would be an interesting one to allow ionic apps to find other instances of the app or other services on the network\n. file transfer will automatically install file plugin if it's not already there.\nI don't think that this will work in ionic serve.  Try it on a real device or an emulator and see if you have the same issue.\nI use the file transfer plugin in my app with no issues with ionic-native.\n. great I'll try this out!. I'm not writing function() etc...\nI am actually just passing in the name of an existing function (ie this.doUpdate) but I guess that is basically doing the same as the above. I will rewrite it with an arrow function and see if that fixes and update.\nThanks, probably should have thought of trying that!. The problem is in the then method you are returning the media object that is needed to control playback and this returns as soon as create is successful, but with the bare plugin the success callback is only called on completion of playback of the current file so it's quite a different behaviour.\nYou can use the status updates to track media status sure but it means that anyone who was relying on the success callback to indicated that playback has finished will have to adjust their app.. It's neither right nor wrong i guess, just changes the implementation.. @ihadeed I actually think that the way it is implemented here is a lot more sensible.  Maybe the output of that call back could be made available in a \"playback complete\" event attached to the mediaObject that users could subscribe to?\nThen all the original functionality of the plugin is available but the way that you use it makes a lot more sense in that create returns when create is successful rather than when playback has completed.\nThat would help to accommodate legacy apps with minimal changes and if you want more detailed playback status you use onStatus callback.. @ihadeed - I'm not sure what has happened but some changes have been made that have now resulting the media plugin being quite broken in 3.6.0.\nLooking at the docs on the ionic site for media, if I follow the documentation with version 3.4.4 of the plugin everything works as expected.\nIf I then just update to 3.6.0 in package.json I immediately get TS throwing errors and aborting builds.\nI would suggest that you revert the media plugin code to be as it was in v3.4.4 as this at least makes the media plugin work and the documentation consistent with the plugin.  More thought needs to be put into this before chopping and changing the way something essential like the create function works.. I saw that when I checked the current source code to see what was up.  Whenever trying to specify the extra callbacks for onSuccess and onError though I get a TS error that this doesn't match the signature of the create method, it seems to still be expecting only src and OnStatusUpdate as arguments.\nPerhaps typings need to be updated as well to resolve that?  If you can check I'll give updating another try.. that's in the IDE it's just VSCODE, all other ionic and ionic-native stuff works fine.  I'll give it another try tomorrow if you think it's just the IDE freaking out over nothing.. this is resolved in 3.8.0 plugin is back to working as normal with all expected call backs and the docs are updated to be accurate as well.\nTested and working on android and iOS with my apps.. ionic-native 3.8.0 resolves the callback issue.  All callbacks are now properly implemented and docs are up to date with correct examples that match the implementation.\nSeek and getcurrentposition work perfectly for me.  I don't use duration because I get that from the server side already.\nI do know that there are some quirks with duration, Android for example will almost always return duration 0 for sources from http but from local file it's fine. This effectively means that you often cannot seek while streaming an audio file on Android.  iOS does not have this issue.  Seems to be very dependant on the source as well, some files work, some don't for me, probably something to do with the encoding.. Hi please try and update to the latest ionic-native and follow the example in the docs.  There were a couple of versions that introduced some issues with media but the v3.8.0 is working fine and the docs are up to date for how to use media now as well.  I can confirm it works fine on both Android and iOS.. Yes I have to wrap code in the obstatusbupdate in zone.run otherwise no change detection as you say.  Same in the onSuccess callback (and I have not tested but presume on error will have the same issue). onSuccess and onError only trigger once and would be better suited as promises rather than observables.\nonStatus could be implemented as an observable.\nBut to be honest, the media plugin as it is now works just fine, it's simple to use just needs a note in the docs to wrap the return functions in ngzone.run() and everything is good.\nThis might be a better long term solution but the benefits are minimal.. Sure but I also think that stability is important here.  The media plugin has had several changes and some breakages in the last few versions and I feel that keeping things stable for a while would be a good think for users.  This change chould certainly be planned for the next major version and delivered with proper migration instructions and details on the breaking changes though.  This would give the short term stability as well as serving the long term goal and providing a clearly documented upgrade path.. Success is only used once, it is called on completion of playback or recording.\nError I know it is called if there are specific errors creating the media object or starting playback (ie network, unsupported file etc).  I can't see any scenario where error would be called more than once as it's generally pretty terminal, but I could be wrong.\nStatus is obviously called multiple times for any changes in playback or recording state.\nAnyway I am happy to test and give input on an updated implementation, I just feel that it's important to keep things stable and well documented.  People seem to struggle a lot with file and media operations already with Cordova and they are some of the more common plugins so stability is an important thing for a happy user base :). @ihadeed ah you're right, I was thinking of a one time use of a media file but if someone is going to play the same media file multiple times then onSuccess will be called each time that playback/recording completes and onError could potentially be called on any play request if something goes wrong.\nI guess in that case an observable may make more sense.. should be able to test it out tomorrow, will update you.. did you call this.audio.play() at the end?  You will need to call play before anything happens.\nAlso this would be better asked in the ionic forums, this github issue is already closed so you are not going to get much response here.. It already exists, check the ionic native docs . if it's working on one platform but not the other and it's a simple mp3 file the most likely culprit is actually the path to the file you want to play as Android and iOS have quite different path structures.  \nYou can use the file plugin to get the native path to the file or a cdvfile: url either of which will simply return the correct path for either platform and both work with the media plugin.\nPaths to access things across platforms is generally a bit of a headache in experience until you work it out.. I've just started looking at this as well.\nHad the same problem with 2.x versions.  I get metadata in control center but play/pause/next/prev are completely non-functional.  Scrubbing forwards with the progress bar works though.\nreverted to 1.4.1 and now I get play/pause/next/prev buttons again.  Play/pause works but next/previous send an action of null so now I can't skip forward or back.\nCordova -ios 4.5.3\nios11\nionic-native 4.3.3\nmusic controls 1.4.1. I submitted updates for the music controls plugin that have been merged\nPlease try installing the latest version of the music controls plugin from the github repo and it should work fine with latest ionic-native using the standard instructions.. @fdambrosio - on iOS or android?\nThe only change on iOS between those versions is the removal an debug log statement that was left in by mistake.  Looks like there was a change to allow custom icons for android though.. @ihadeed - would be great if you could merge this one, only small changes, all working in my own apps for the last few days of testing.\nFor change log:\nfix(music-controls) - optional parameters are OPTIONAL\nfix(music-controls documentation) - fix some errors in the usage examples\nnew(music-controls hasScrubbing option) - optional variable to enable lock screen seeking with progress bar on iOS.. actually I have just matched them to the plugin itself.  So if it is optional for the plugin then it should be optional for the wrapper.\nThe plugin will apply default values to meet the basic requirements if you provide no values.\nI agree that using the plugin with no options would be kind of pointless.. what code are you using to write to / read from the external storage?\nThe paths referred to as \"external\" by the file plugin do NOT reference removable media like SDCards so it's a bit misleading.\nIf you want to access files on an SDcard I would recommend grabbing the diagnostic plugin which has the required methods to find available removable storage, request permissions to it (which the base file plugin doesn't do either) and return you the path which you can then use with the file and file transfer plugins to read and write as required.\nTook me some time to figure out that little mess myself!.

I followed the steps of Brandy on this commit: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-conference-app/commit/1b81cf22b7a8ebf584857b5891a56e91efcb240a\n. Order imports alphabetically, use spaces in imports like angular and 2 spaces (tabs) as stated in the .editorconfig.\nI'm in vacation right now, if you will merge this when I finish I'll continue this when I come back.\n. @ihadeed you can change whatever you need, I'll fix and complete the PR when I come back.\n. Yes, we are planning to replace Google Analytics in favor of mixpanel.\n. https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#testing-your-changes\n. https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/7205\nWe should add this to ionic-native documentation or add the fix to scss file...\n. The first piece of code is working on my project, can you provide more info please?\n. WIP don't merge please.\n. This should be able to merge but I'm not sure if permissionGroups is okay.\n. I have review permissionGroups and looks fine, also fix a little typo, you can merge this @ihadeed .\n. You are right: https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/wiki/Map#move-the-camera\n. Hey! Thanks for this PR, have you been able to remove the delays while sharing? I'm actually using socialsharing without the wrapper...\n. You should ask for support on Google Maps repo, this is just a wrapper...\n. You can use geocoder but works in english and you can't change language (in my case this is a problem).\nBTW the perfect combination is to use both, Google Places and Geocoder, but from cordova-plugin-googlemaps you can only use geocoder.\n. Have you tried with branch master?\nAlso offtopic (sorry): How did you get those debug logs?\n. I was refering to branch master of Google Maps plugin.\nHow many markers are you adding? Does the code fails when you add the first marker?\n. Try this:\nthis.map.addMarker({\n   'position': ionic,\n   'title': 'ionic',\n   markerClick: (marker) => {\n     marker.showInfoWindow();\n   },\n   infoClick: (marker) => {\n     console.log('info clicked');\n   }\n});\n. You can close this as well @ihadeed :). I'm not 100% sure, but could be solved by: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/9726. Seems to be caused by 67adb23a145c8ec615e59e43d420ca7327905b75, tested master + cherry-pick of src/plugins/plugin.ts from 95410097428e939f4ee38c7d4817f696acdb18cc and the issue disappears..

    "Artfloriani": "Thank you @ihadeed.\nAs the Geolocation plugin works without installing it, I thought others would be just the same.\nI followed your steps for the ImagePicker plugin but I still get 'undefined' when trying to access the ImagePicker.

I guess both of these issues have nothing to do with ionic-native, I'll try to debug it further.\nThank you.\nEDIT:\nSo the ImagePicker issue is because I installed ionic-native yesterday and didn`t see the new version today. I did an npm install and this was fixed. I'm still looking into the issue on the LocalNotification but I believe that is an issue of that plugin\n. I found a fix for all the issues.

I'm not 100% sure why the script thought there were changes when there were none. I'm guessing it has something to do with how bash evaluates strings for equivalency. I removed the var, putting the git status --porcelain in the evaluation itself. It worked this time. Let me know if you see an error again.

Thanks! . !(testing)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo]. . Hey @wf9a5m75, the maintainer of that plugin decided to build their plugin in an entirely different repo, so our documentation scripts don't see it. It's on our todo list to add some special scripts to make sure it's included. For the beta launch we were more focused on the plugins in this repo. . Hey @wf9a5m75, I'm not ignoring you, it has been less than a day. I think the negative tone is unnecessary. Let's try this again. Your plugin is great and I have no opinion on whether it's good or bad that it's in a different repo. We were focused on plugins inside this repo while we were scrambling to get these beta docs out. That script you linked to is for the stable docs here. The new beta native docs are generated in this file. \nI'm currently working on a different project but can add a link to your separate repo when I work on the docs later this week. I was hoping I could write a script to inspect it and automatically generate a docs page like the others, but a link would work for now. . Hey @wf9a5m75, adding this should be very quick and easy, but the larger build script needs some updates to get it to take effect on the website. I can't do it today, but it should be soon. . Ah, the docs were refactored and the person who took it over didn't know about this special case. I've brought him up to speed. . ",

From @ghenry22 on July 25, 2016 7:40\nprobably better to log this against the inappbrowser cordova plugin, this doesn't look like an ionic issue.\n. From @devarg on August 28, 2016 20:48\nHi @endriazizi which version of ionic-native are you using on your package.json? Consider updating to version 1.3.20 that's the latest which includes SecureStorage, previous versions might not have the dependency you are trying to install.\n1.  Update ionic-native dependency on your package.json to \"ionic-native\": \"1.3.20\" and save it\n2.  Close VS Code\n3.  Open cmd/terminal with admin rights\n4.  Navigate to your project root\n5.  Run npm install and make sure no red messages pop it should respond something similar to this\n   testproj@ c:\\Users\\devarg\\Documents\\dev\\TestProj\\app-ui-- ionic-native@1.3.20\n   `\n6. Reopen VS Code and check that your import now should not be red-marked.\nLet me know if you have any other issues.\n. Thanks for using Ionic!\n.

From @ZiFFeL1992 on October 20, 2016 9:46\nI think you should post this here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues\n. Hello, thanks for using Ionic! This is actually an issue with the plugin and not with app-scripts. It looks as if the plugin is expecting you to add some icons. Because this is not an app-scripts issue I am going to close this one for now and move it to the ionic-native repo.\n. From @adirzoari on October 28, 2016 6:35\n@jthoms1 thank you. \nanyone has solution for that?\nI'm still stuck with that.\n. From @BAWES on October 28, 2016 20:40\nNot sure where the core of the issue is originating from, but found out that change detection wasn't functioning correctly and solved it by triggering the detection manually.\nMy workaround:\n- import { ApplicationRef } from '@angular/core';\n- constructor(private ref:ApplicationRef) {\nThen trigger the change detection as follows:\n```\nKeyboard.onKeyboardShow().subscribe(e => {\n      this.isKeyboardOpen = true;\n      this.keyboardHeight = e.keyboardHeight;\n  // Force Change Detection in Angular\n  this.ref.tick();\n});\n\n``\n. Hello, this is most likely an issue caused by the change from the keyboard plugin not running in azone.Zone.jsis the library that runs change detection in Angular 2. If an event is not async then it will not trigger a zone update. I am going to move this issue to theionic nativerepo since this is related to anionic native` plugin. Thanks!\n.

It might be better if you open this issue on the ionic-native repo instead: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native. From @AndreasGassmann on January 9, 2017 11:56\nThe plugin works fine for me with Ionic RC4.\nCan you try updating to the latest Ionic Native version? Maybe also update your ionic CLI.\nFYI: 3 weeks ago the API of the Network Plugin changed. It is now Network.type instead of Network.connection. https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/commit/ec5e27be4b1455ad5b0ee4ea2da5592e63be3dea . . From @dylanvdmerwe on January 26, 2017 7:4\nThis was changed a long time ago in the ionic native plugin. https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/releases/tag/v2.2.12. Hey, thanks for using Ionic! To be honest i've never seen this error before, would you mind posting a repo we can use to reproduce this issue? . From @BSWG on January 25, 2017 21:8\nHi, actually after doing some more research I found out that it has something to do with Ionic Native's SafariViewController. \nSafariViewController.isAvailable().then((available: boolean) => {\n      if(!available) return;\n      SafariViewController.warmUp();\n});\nIf I remove SafariViewController.warmUp(); the Exception disappears. Under the hood this warmUp() is supposed to warm up Chrome Tabs. But this fails even on an Android device it seems.\nAlthough I resolved the exception for now the warning remains:\n[21:14:50] console.warn: Native: deviceready did not fire within 2000ms. This can happen when plugins are in an\ninconsistent state. Try removing plugins from plugins/ and reinstalling them.\n[21:14:50] console.log: deviceready has not fired after 5 seconds.\n[21:14:50] error opening ws message: {\"category\":\"console\",\"type\":\"log\",\"data\":[\"DEVICE READY FIRED AFTER\",3938,\"ms\"]}. Thanks for the info @BSWG . Based off the info you provided I am going to close and move this issue to the ionic native repo.. Ahh awesome @ihadeed Ill go ahead and close this one then.. From @rapropos on March 24, 2017 0:0\nShould probably be reassigned to ionic-native, but I suspect the problem is failure to adjust to the new injectable syntax:\nOLD:\n```\nimport {Plugin} from \"ionic-native\";\nconstructor() {\n  Plugin.frobulate();\n}\n```\nNEW:\n```\nimport {Plugin} from \"@ionic-native/plugin\";\nconstructor(plugin: Plugin) {\n  plugin.frobulate();\n}\n```. From @Klerith on March 24, 2017 0:4\nI use the new syntax version using '@ionic-native/contacts'\nBut after running some test here, looks like it works on devices, but in the browsers crashes with that error.\n. Hello @AmitMY is this issue in reference to the lazy loading in the framework or the deeplinking cordova plugin?. From @AmitMY on May 1, 2017 18:34\n@jgw96 Yep I got confused. Can you please move this to ionic-native?. No problem! Can do.. From @MTechDE on May 3, 2017 17:50\nMaybe that is a problem with your npm cache.\nIf you run npm install --save @ionic-native/sqlite@latest you should get the latest release. Hello, thanks for opening an issue with us. Are you using ionic-native ?. From @brettdorrans on May 12, 2017 14:42\nHi, thanks for responding.\nI am using ionic-native/media@3.7.0 following the docs provided here: https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/media/\nI managed to get audio playing using Native Audio - I suspect the Media plugin isn't playing nice with paths on device targets?\nI think this might be better reported in the ionic-native repo - but I'm not sure!\nCheers\nBrett. Thanks for the info! Yeah, since this is an ionic-native issue I am going to move this issue over to that repo. Thanks for using Ionic!. From @AmitMY on May 30, 2017 10:15\nI think it will be better if you open this issue with ionic-native, as it is the camera plugin that is problematic.\nI just tested in my app, in which I have something like yours, on iOS, but only with sourceType, destinationType, and encodingType set (exactly the same values as yours), and it does show that image.\nSo I recommend to also try remove all of the other properties just for a test, perhaps one of your properties is causing it on iOS.. From @plul on June 9, 2017 13:45\nTry this: https://github.com/arnesson/cordova-plugin-firebase/issues/275#issuecomment-301818002. From @AmitMY on June 27, 2017 7:38\n\nPlease fill issue template.\nI would assume that the printer window that is opened is not waiting to ready event, and creates a temp PDF of an empty page. You have access to the opened window's window object, listen for the ready event and only when ready try to print, might work. From @AmitMY on July 2, 2017 21:22\n\nAs it says, it requires 6.4.0 or higher, no way around it. Try npm install -g cordova@latest or your preferred version if you have any. From @HamzaLJ on July 2, 2017 21:46\n@AmitMY of course I've tried that already, it seems to be installed; however, when running an ionic info it shows 6.3.0. From @AmitMY on July 2, 2017 21:47\ncordova -v output?. From @HamzaLJ on July 2, 2017 22:1\n@AmitMY as I told you before that was 7.0.1 on ionic info it's still 6.3.0. From @AmitMY on July 3, 2017 6:6\n\nPlease fill the issue template\n\nThis should be opened againstionic-native or that plugin's repo, as it is not a problem with the framework but with a native plugin. From @AmitMY on July 2, 2017 15:18\n\n\nPlease fill the issue template\n\nFirst thing I would check is remove platforms and plugins folders, and ionic cordova prepare, then make sure that the plugin is in the plugins folder, if it not, reinstall it.\nIf that doesn't work, please create an issue with ionic-native as clipboard is a native plugin and is not related to the ionic core. From @russcarver on July 7, 2017 4:50\n\nI've been dealing with this for a week as well.  Any update?. From @AmitMY on July 7, 2017 11:2\nTry removing your platforms & plugins folders, and ionic cordova prepare, and try again.. From @AmitMY on July 26, 2017 4:56\nThanks for opening an issue.\nYou will get better help by moving this issue to https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native, as this repo handles the ionic core, and that one handles the cordova plugins.

Sorry for not being more precise, i have installed ionic-native from npm and am now trying to just import the single Toast plugin.\nThe problem seems to be that i was missing the es6-shim definition file, \nas mentiond in this thread the es6-shim definition is included with angular 2, which could be why you havent had the problem.\nThanks \n. Ok - Thanks.\n. ",
    "Ritzlgrmft": ":+1: \n. I just tried @Cordova({ sync: true }). Generally, it works now, the promise gets now resolved. I think it's not too bad, that the promise has a different source, since at least then and catch seem to be quite similar.\nHowever, in my test page, I display the results of the cordova calls. This does not work immediately, since change detection in Angular 2 gets not triggered. So I would really appreciate, if you could add a new option to the @Cordova decorator converting Q.Promise into Promise.\n. I added a new option @Cordova({ otherPromise: true }). With this option, the plugin is called like with the sync option, and afterwards the promise is wrapped into the promise used by ionic-native.\nCould you check the implementation at https://github.com/Ritzlgrmft/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/plugin.ts#L99? If it is fine for you, I will merge it as soon as the plugin is working.\n. And another question: for startMonitoring (see https://github.com/petermetz/cordova-plugin-ibeacon#start-monitoring-a-single-ibeacon), I need a parameter of type BeaconRegion. In vanilla JavaScript this looks like:\nvar beaconRegion = new cordova.plugins.locationManager.BeaconRegion(identifier, uuid, major, minor);\ncordova.plugins.locationManager.startMonitoringForRegion(beaconRegion);\nUsing ionic-native, I would like to write\nvar beaconRegion = new IBeacon.BeaconRegion(identifier, uuid, major, minor);\nIBeacon.startMonitoringForRegion(beaconRegion);\nThe second line is working, but the first line not. For this, I assume I have to define the BeaconRegion also in some way. But I do not know, how?\n. @ihadeed At least one important statement is missing in your proposal:\ncordova.plugins.locationManager.setDelegate(this._objectInstance);\nBut this should be called not before all needed events are subscribed. So it would be a little bit ugly to add it to your approach.\nAn advantage of your approach is the un-subscription of the events. But to be honest, I only subscribe to the events once. I have no need to unsubscribe.\nAnd moreover: Justin's implementation just works.\n. I created a new Ionic project with ionic start ... --v2 --typescript, updated ionic-native to the newest version and added to platform.ready:\ntry {\n  IBeacon.enableDebugLogs()\n    .then(() => { \n      alert('success'); \n    }).catch(reason => { \n      alert('failed: ' + reason); \n    });\n} catch (e) { \n  alert('error: ' + e); \n}\nMaybe this happens because of the sync option?\n. Yes, it is working.\nAdditionally, I get a rejected promise, if the plugin is not available - as it should be.\n. ",

Hopefully this PR will address writeFile, but createFile doesn't seem to have a similar problem, so I'm not sure what's going on there.\n. Are all plugins supposed to release en masse? I am seeing core at 3.1.0-rc.3, but imagepicker is only showing [ '3.0.0-alpha.0', '3.0.0-alpha.1', '3.0.0' ]. I am trying to figure out if this is a temporary situation due to the recency of the release or if some plugins are intentionally not being bumped.. It is not a stub. If you look at the accompanying JavaScript, you will see that the @Cordova decorator is doing a lot of work behind the scenes. Please describe your actual problem including expected and observed behavior, not something as vague as \"not work\".. The documentation told you to declare it as a provider in your app module. Did you follow that part?. @rlightner that is a question better suited for the support forums. I think this issue can safely be closed.. In the future, please use the support forums for support requests like this. angular #11262 explains the issue.. It looks to me like you have two conflicting versions of ionic-native installed. I would get rid of the \"ionic-native\" one. Also, since ionic-native 3 has Angular 4 as a dev dependency, I would look at upgrading that as well.. This is not a good candidate for a GitHub issue. Please open a topic on the support forums instead.. Looks like it's already included to me.. > Media Plugin 3.5.0 doesn't fire promise.\nCan you see if this is still a problem with 3.6.0?. I totally disagree with this. Only properties accessed by templates need to be public, and ionic-native plugins are very rarely, if ever, interacted with by templates directly.. What impact does ionic-native's devDependencies have on end users?. Upgrade @ionic-native/core to at least 3.6.0.. This seems like a better fit for the support forums.. > just needs a note in the docs to wrap the return functions in ngzone.run()\nI will defer to the eventual decision here, but cannot disagree more strongly with this. I see ionic-native as a way to ensure that app code never needs to explicitly deal with Angular zones. Especially if the eventual goal is to allow replacing Angular with other frameworks, it makes it all the more crucial that we do not encourage app code to ever manually interact with zones.. This looks like a better fit for the support forums to me.. The plugin calls parseInt() on them. I believe they are strings.. ",

    "rob3c": "The rxjs dependency should probably be declared in peerDependencies instead of dependencies in package.json, since the idea is to interop with the rest of the ionic app rather than it being self-contained in the module. That would parallel angular2's peerDependencies rxjs declaration, which ionic itself transitively depends on via its peerDependencies declaration for angular2.\nAlso, since ionic-native only seems to use rxjs in a simple way for the Observable definition and the occasional subscribe call from my scan through the source - i.e. things that aren't likely to break in further beta releases - you could minimize the maintenance headache for this by setting a range just for the beta, like >5.0.0-beta <5.0.0 or similar.\n. .first().subscribe() or .take(1).subscribe() would work, but you can always do .toPromise() on the Observable to get a single value and not worry about unsubscribing, since it auto-unsubscribe afterwards.\nI agree the tapping feature doesn't seem useful except maybe to dismiss it early, although tapping an actual button on a toast can be handy.\nThe overloading of the show and click events in the same observable is a bit confusing since they're semantically different. The first next event is onShow,  the second next is onClick (tedious to track), and complete is essentially onClick too, since it won't complete otherwise (handy to avoid counting nexts, though.) A more common use of observables is as a stream of similar types of things. Using them with state machines is ok when you're passing the next state explicitly, but here it's implicit and a bit awkward.\nMore importantly, having the equivalent of a finally action when you don't care about clicks leads to unnecessary code duplication. Since you can't just .finally() on the observable, you have to duplicate finally actions across your next and error handlers. However, this could be remedied by completing the observable after it's no longer visible/clickable (at the expense of tracking next counts if you were using complete for onClick). Of course, you can .timeout() the observable yourself, but that triggers error for a timeout.\nOne argument for keeping it as an observable is similar to angular2's Http, which returns an observable for a single value where you might expect a promise: unsubscribe lets you cancel the request (hide the toast, in this case, though not sure if it really does this), whereas promises have no inherent cancellation mechanism.\n.

I'd take a swing at adding this to ionic-native but after looking at the method signatures I'm not sure how best to approach it. There are multiple things I don't see an easy way to do in the way ionic-native wraps plugins. For an example of the different types of function signatures:\n\ngetLibrary(successCallback, failureCallback, config, progressCallback)\nsaveImage(param1, param2, successCallback, failureCallback)\nrequestAuthorization(successCallback, failureCallback, config?)\ngetThumbnailURL(param1, successCallback, failureCallback, config?)\ngetPhotoURL(param1, successCallback, failureCallback)\n\n@ihadeed Am I understanding that I can use errorIndex and successIndex to solve the more challenging ones? I've never used them and I don't know if they will work like I want them to in this situation. For example is this (as a final product) possible:\n````\n//callbackOrder: 'reverse'\nPhotoLibrary.getLibrary(config, progressCallback).then(() => {}, () => {});\n//No special config\nPhotoLibrary.saveImage(param1, param2).then(() => {}, () => {});\n//callbackOrder: 'reverse'\nPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(config?).then(() => {}, () => {});\n//successIndex: 1, errorIndex: 2\nPhotoLibrary.getThumbnailURL(param1, config?).then(() => {}, () => {});\n//No special config\nPhotoLibrary.getPhotoURL(param1).then(() => {}, () => {});\n````\nIf it is I can take a shot at this.\n. @arberK While I have no use (ATM) of this plugin I was going to take a swing at writing up the code for it. However I've been extremely busy as of late and I'm not sure when I'll be able to get around to it. I'd encourage you to look at some of the other plugins to get a feel for how to write the required \"wiring up code\". It's really rather simple and the biggest hurdle (IMHO) is testing what you wrote works.\nAlso like I mentioned about this plugin does have TS definitions built into it and you can always use the plugin directly even without it being in Ionic Native. \nWhile I'm neither part of the ionic or ionic-native team and don't speak for them I'd say it isn't in ionic-native because there aren't enough people asking for it and/or no one has stepped up to write it. .

Unfortunately, the js and Android libs are a little different since the beginning, in terms of methods and namings. Some methods  AFAIK it would be a very manual work to get it done making sure everything is working alright, but it's possible like in this example:\n\n``` javascript\n// native plugin\nvar mapDiv = document.getElementById(\"map_canvas\");\nvar mapConfig = {\n  'backgroundColor': 'white',\n  'mapType': plugin.google.maps.MapTypeId.HYBRID\n};\nvar map = plugin.google.maps.Map.getMap(mapDiv, mapConfig);\n```\n``` javascript\n// js web library\nvar mapDiv = document.getElementById(\"map_canvas\");\nvar mapConfig = {\n  center: {lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644},\n  scrollwheel: false,\n  zoom: 8\n};\nvar map = new google.maps.Map(mapDiv, mapOptions);\n```\nIf you keep the work based on Promises and Observables, as it is being done in the current ionic-native module implementation, I think it can be abstracted without much effort.\nBut about the need to load the Google Maps js lib, I believe (not completely sure) the lib can be imported right from the module code dynamically, just like it's done for Facebook and Google Analytics libs, for example. In those cases, I've already had an experience involving importing a js lib right after instantiating a class. I'll test it soon to ensure my words and will attach a snippet with the example here if I succeeed.\n. Project's source code: https://github.com/RioBus/ionic\n. I think it may be a problem in the wrapper, because this is the flow of the app:\n1. Load the Search view, which has components which leads to the map view with data when clicked.\n2. When the map view is loaded (always with data) it displays a map component with the markers.\nThe error explodes when the app is opened after I close it with backbutton, which always happens when my displayed view is the Search view, which is always the stack root. This flow blows:\n1. Open the app. I'm in search view. Nothing about maps here.\n2. backbutton and close the app.\n3. Open the app without clean it from 'recents'. It should open the search view, but it explodes the mentioned error in the console while in the splashscreen.\n. I just did some more testing in my code to check your suggestions and make sure the problem is not my code. I did some logs in every place I was using the LatLng plugin through ionic-native to identify where were the code going through in my flow, to discover if it was being accessed before expected in my code and none of the places I placed console.logs were executed when the app was opened.\n.

    "danbucholtz": "@tlancina, what do you think about this?\n. Thanks @ihadeed, you are awesome!  Let's still see what Tim thinks as he is the resident keyboard expert.\n. Yes.  It should just work.  Let me know if you have any issues.\nThanks,\nDan\n. You rock @ihadeed !\n. @ihadeed, you rock! \ud83d\udcaf \n. @ihadeed, not presently, no. www dir vs platform dir.\nThanks,\nDan. I have been kicking around the idea of using stencil components for parts of Ionic Native. Since Stencil components are lazy loaded by default, we can get away with some pretty neat platform-specific things without introducing a lot of code maintenance/overhead.\nOne of my goals of Ionic Native has always been to support multiple platforms with one API. Namely, cordova, traditional web, and electron with one API. That way, I truly can write once and deploy anywhere.\nFor the sake of discussion, let's consider the writeFile API.\nIf we wanted to support multiple platforms and only load the code actually used for the platform, we could do something like this:\n```ts\n@Component({\n    tag: 'ion-file-api'\n})\nexport class IonFileAPI implements FileAPI {\n@Method writefile(filePath: string, fileContent) {\n    return writeFileImpl(getPlatform(), filePath, fileContent);\n}\n\n}\nwriteFileImpl(platform: string, filePath: string, fileContent: string) {\n    const tagName = ${platform}-file-api;\n    let element = document.querySelector(tagName);\n    if (!element) {\n        // it is doesn't exist, insert it\n        element = document.createElement(${platform}-file-api); // , , \n        document.body.appendChild(element);\n    }\n    // isReady is a utility function that ensures an element is fully hydrated and ready to go before resolving a promise\n    return isReady(element).then((fileApi) => {\n        return fileApi.writeFile(filePath, fileContent);\n    });\n}\n````\nThe ion-file-api is a component that could be added to the document.body behind the scenes or directly. This would open the door to using the file api, which is already async by nature.\nIn the writeFileImpl method, we append a node dynamically. This node would either be web-file-api, electron-file-api, or cordova-file-api for the sake of argument. When this node hits the DOM, it loads the platform specific code needed to execute and perform the API call.\nI could then have two stencil components that look like this:\n```ts\n@Component({\n    tag: 'web-file-api'\n})\nexport class WebFileApi implements FileAPI {\n@Method writeFile(filePath: string, fileContent: string) {\n    // write to local storage\n}\n\n}\n```\n```ts\n@Component({\n    tag: 'cordova-file-api'\n})\nexport class CordovaFileApi implements FileAPI {\n@Method writeFile(filePath: string, fileContent: string) {\n    // use cordova api\n}\n\n}\n```\nWhere one is used for web, and the other is used for Cordova.\nSo what is really happening here? Well, first of all, when the ion-file-api node hits the dom, it begins lazy loading it's own writeFile implementation. That writeFile implementation doesn't actually write a file, it just loads another DOM node, and delegate the writing of the file to it. Since everything is async already, the user gets one promise and they're none-the-wiser.\nFrom a developer experience perspective, developer's don't even need to know anything about the DOM or that Ionic native uses it at all.\nThey could write code like this:\n```ts\nimport { File } from '@ionic-native/file';\nexport class SomeAngularComponent {\nionViewDidEnter() {\n    File.writeFile('myFilePath.txt', 'someContent');\n}\n\n}\n```\nIn this example, when File.writeFile is called, it appends the ion-file-api to the DOM, which in turns appends the worker nodes to the DOM.\nI think this approach makes a ton of sense because the developer experience is great, and this would enable us to support multiple platforms with one code base, without adding unnecessary size and complexity to a user's app.\nThanks,\nDan. @ihadeed, looks like some git merge issues in this file.\nThanks,\nDan\n.

    "justinschuldt": "Hey,\nThis plugin's methods were written to return Q promises, which do not seem to return if the method is wrapped in the wrapPromise() function. \nInvoking a method with the synchronous option just returns the result of the plugin's method, which in this case is a promise, so I think that usage is alright?\nI'm not sure that setting @Cordova({ sync: true }) is the best way handle these methods. This plugin is written differently than others I have seen. Most of the class methods return promises that resolve when the native layer acknowledges the request. The promises' success does not return any data, it just signals that the request reached the native layer and was understood. The delegate methods are used as callbacks for native events (didEnterRegion, etc). \nUsing it looks something like this:\nthis.delegate = IBeacon.Delegate();\nthis.delegate.didDetermineStateForRegion()\n  .subscribe(\n    data => console.log('didDetermineStateForRegion: ', data)\n  );\nthis.beaconRegion = IBeacon.BeaconRegion('deskBeacon', 'F7826DA6-ASDF-ASDF-8024-BC5B71E0893E');\nIBeacon.startMonitoringForRegion(this.beaconRegion)\n  .then(\n    result => console.log('request to start monitoring accepted: ', result),\n    error => console.error('request to start monitoring failed: ', error)\n  );\nIBeacon.requestStateForRegion(this.beaconRegion)\n  .then(\n    result => console.log('request for region state accepted: ', result),\n    error => console.error('request for region state failed: ', error)\n  );\nThe code above would output this to the console:\nrequest to start monitoring accepted: OK\nrequest for region state accepted: OK\ndidDetermineStateForRegion: {\"eventType\":\"didDetermineStateForRegion\",\"region\":{\"identifier\":\"deskBeacon\",\"typeName\":\"BeaconRegion\",\"uuid\":\"F7826DA6-ASDF-ASDF-8024-BC5B71E0893E\"}}\nThe promises that the class methods return aren't really important, but that's how the author wrote it, so I just tried to match his api.

After looking at that repo I now understand. . Having issues debugging; will re-open when I can re-confirm on phone.. @ihadeed -- Yeah, my changes are to give the user an interface to work with using the acceptable features, and then maps the object into a comma-separated string in the constructor. I just messed something up somewhere when I'm debugging -- maybe I didn't build my version of ionic-native correctly. . @ihadeed - I've created a new Pull Request for this with a better description and more commits. . If you're opening up the Google Maps app, even if it's invoked from InAppBrowser, it won't open the app inside of a WebView. At least as far as I know.\nInAppBrowser will only control what's in an InAppBrowser instance.. How would you test a newly added plugin since each plugin is it's own dependency?. @joshbabb -- I did that as well. \nThe Ionic Native 3.x structure has each plugin as it's own node dependency, so this is what my package.json is looking like:\njson\n\"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/common\": \"2.4.8\",\n      ...\n    \"@ionic-native/core\": \"3.1.0\",\n    \"@ionic-native/splash-screen\": \"3.1.0\",\n    \"@ionic-native/status-bar\": \"3.1.0\",\n    \"@ionic-native/intel-security\": \"file:node_modules/ionic-native/dist/@ionic-native/intel-security\",\n     ...\n    \"zone.js\": \"0.7.2\"\n  },\nBut when I a) try npm install @ionic-native/intel-security or b) try to just reference it in the code, I get:\nshell\nnpm ERR! git C:\\Users\\ehorodys\\Desktop\\test\\node_modules\\ionic-native: Appears to be a git repo or submodule.\nI did copy the entire ionic-native project into node_modules/ionic-native however, maybe I need to remove anything that isn't dist?\nEdit: This fixed it. I know it's implicitly stated in the docs, but maybe it should be more explicit? . Hey @joshbabb -- Thanks for the response.\nI got it working, I moved over the entire ionic-native package, and it literally just needs to be dist. I should have listened to the docs, but I wasn't sure if it was accurate. I thought that since each plugin is it's own module that it would follow a folder structure in node_modules  where each plugin got it's own folder.\nVery happy it isn't, but that was my line of thinking.\nThanks again for the help!\n- Eric. Do you mind if I ask the reasoning behind this? \nIn all fairness, my team has no interest in building anything Cordova-based without Ionic 2 going forward, but we have Ionic 1 apps currently in development and \"global\" components that we are trying to keep framework agnostic (of course, with the only caveat being that it's Cordova-based). . @mlynch -- Thanks for the update. I understand the current prioritization of 3.x.\nWhen it's time to start back up on 2.x, I'd love to help contribute, time permitting (who knows, maybe my job will bank me hours to help considering we use Cordova so heavily).\nI think it's really important, as a Cordova and Ionic consumer, to try to align the efforts Cordova is currently committing to with Typescript typings with the work being done with Ionic Native. \nI'm an Ionic loyalist, but I'm a pragmatist first -- and if Ionic, for any reason I can't think of -- whether it's projects coming in from vendors (or in our case, even volunteers and members as a not-for-profit) or conflicting framework viewpoints or whatever, it's important to have the foundation Ionic Native provides at my disposal. \nAnyway, thanks for the response (and apologize for the outrage), and let me know how I can help efforts to decouple Ionic Native from the Ionic framework in the future. Would love to contribute more when available.\nBest,\nEric. Changes made, thank you!\nThe only thing I can't figure out is now the console is logging cordova_not_available from polyfills.js.. Thanks @ihadeed -- I'm working on the changes now.\nSome \"author notes\" from me: :-P\n * I didn't set IntelSecurityData or IntelSecurityStorage as Injectable classes because they really work in-tandem. It's my attempt at trying to keep the original intel.security.storage and intel.security.data namespacing in-tact for consumers. \n* The hesitation on adding Interfaces is based on the lack of examples and documentation from Intel on the additional (optional) properties. Some of the method documentations state that there are parameters that exist that aren't currently being used...also, some methods use object containers as a parameter, but there are a total of like 2 properties for it. Actually, I think if any method in this plugin has more than one parameter it's expected to be passed in as an object container.\nAnyway, changes coming soon once I can verify they work in a sample Ionic project. Thank you for the help and guidance through this!. @ihadeed -- I'm running into this issue now after changing the @Cordova() decorator:\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'constructor' of null\n    at checkAvailability (main.js:81923)\n    at callCordovaPlugin (main.js:82018)\n    at main.js:82046\n    at main.js:55921\n    at new t (polyfills.js:3)\n    at tryNativePromise (main.js:55920)\n    at getPromise (main.js:55928)\n    at wrapOtherPromise (main.js:82045)\n    at main.js:82139\n    at value (main.js:115414)\n    at t.invoke (polyfills.js:3)\n    at Object.onInvoke (main.js:35928)\n    at t.invoke (polyfills.js:3)\n    at e.run (polyfills.js:3)\n    at polyfills.js:3\n.

Any ETA on this one? Sorry to nag.\n. I'd vote for waiting since - in theory - it is a very short wait and always a one time thing. (To be clear, I only chimed in here cuz of the Contacts stuff, no idea about the rest. ;)\n. Been a month now - any way we can get this in? If not, can a fix for #737 be done in another PR?. A bit more info - basically the issue is that the TS file knows it is an array, but doesn't accept that it may be null too. \n. So I removed readonly on the photos prop from the TS file and was able to get stuff working. :)\n. Nope. You get an error. That goes away when readonly is removed. \n. Thanks. Any idea when this PR will get pulled in? \n. Ok, do you mind a dumb question? My code is doing this when a contact has no photos:\n```\n          var f = new ContactField('base64',s,true);\n      contact.photos = [];\n      contact.photos.push(f);\n\n```\nWill that work - specifically setting it to an empty array? I mean it works now with my hack (removing readonly), but your proper fix is a bit different.\n. Thanks!. I'm confused - you say this is fixed? I'm not seeing it fixed. You are definitely right that the lower docs are cleaner, but the one on top is still formatted poorly..

Hey there, \nI  just sidestepped it in the end by using the execute script to add the css. There's no real magic in the insertCSS routine so I don't feel like I'm missing much.\nAs a sidenote, I've been developing quite heavily with the InAppBrowser over the last three weeks. Some things I've found, which you may or may not know:\n1) Do not use the InAppBrowser with WKWebView on IOS, it's like jumping into a bag of snakes. Events get fired by the window rather than the URL loading, it's a total nightmare.\n2) on IOS, the executeScript with code seems to work much more reliably that the execute script with a file, this may also be a CORS issue, but it was intermittent and therefore hard to debug.\nIn general, the InAppBrowser behaves as you would expect in Android, all the time, and is a bit flaky with IOS.

A npm run build of the repo successfully includes camera preview in /dist. About a week ago the plugin was being included in Ionic Native correctly, but @cfjedimaster is correct, it is currently not getting into /plugins in the node module.\n. A new build should be run and published to npm so that the plugin is included\n. This happens because isCameraEnabled() should have been isCameraAvailable(). Same for isBluetoothEnabled(), isLocationEnabled(), and isWifiEnabled(). All are fixed in this PR: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/373\n. Fixes https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/365\n. Addresses https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/364\n. +1 on the first option. Observable seems to be in line with how other wrappers implement this type of thing.\n. No problem. I've prefixed the Size and Rect interfaces\n. Oops must have cut the branch wrong. New commit reverts Camera Preview plugin for this branch to what's in master.\n. @ihadeed I tried your suggestion for onTransitionReceived, but it returns a ZoneAwarePromise rather than an observer. Any advice?\n. Removed the Cordova decorator. Function now returns the Observable, but the observer is never called.\n. Here's the plugin code:\n```\nstatic onTransitionReceived(): Observable {\nreturn new Observable<any>((observer) => {\n  window.geofence.onTransitionReceived = observer.next.bind(observer);\n  return null;\n  // undefined can be replaced with ()=>{} .. whichever works better\n});\n\n}\n```\nAnd here's the code calling it, which should update a data binding in the view, but does not appear to:\nGeofence.onTransitionReceived().subscribe(()=>this.transited='TRANSITED');\n. Made some minor adjustments from what main Ionic repo uses, but general format being used here seems to be the same.\n. It would be better to use ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges(), since that will do change detection only on the component and it's children. \nApplicationRef.tick() will do change detection on the entire component tree, I believe.\nI've opened a separate issue to see about getting change detection triggered automatically when observables return: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/823. These are available as static members of BackgroundGeolocation, e.g.:\n```\nimport { BackgroundGeolocation } from  'ionic-native';\n...\nexport class HomePage {\nconstructor(public navCtrl: NavController) {\n    console.log(BackgroundGeolocation.LocationProvider.ANDROID_DISTANCE_FILTER_PROVIDER);\n    console.log(BackgroundGeolocation.LocationProvider.ANDROID_ACTIVITY_PROVIDER);\n    console.log(BackgroundGeolocation.Accuracy.HIGH);\n    console.log(BackgroundGeolocation.Accuracy.MEDIUM);\n    console.log(BackgroundGeolocation.Accuracy.LOW);\n    console.log(BackgroundGeolocation.Accuracy.PASSIVE);\n    console.log(BackgroundGeolocation.Mode.BACKGROUND);\n    console.log(BackgroundGeolocation.Mode.FOREGROUND);\n}\n}\n``. It looks like you may have a race condition happening. Since you are callingCameraPreview.setOnPictureTakenHandler()in the constructor, it's possible that Cordova hasn't been completely loaded by the Ionic. Try wrapping your try block in a call toPlatform.ready()` to ensure it isn't called until the full framework has loaded:\n```\nimport { Platform } from 'ionic-angular'\n...\n//instantiate Platform\nconstructor(public navCtrl: NavController, public platform: Platform) {\n    this.logs = [];\n    this.isCamOn = false;\n//do the try/catch after platform.ready() resolves\nthis.platform.ready().then(\n    () => { \n        try {\n          CameraPreview.setOnPictureTakenHandler().subscribe((result) => {\n            this.logs.push('setOnPictureTakenHandler');\n            this.onCameraPreview(result);\n          });\n        }\n        catch (e) { \n          // exception is thrown and e is equal to \"plugin_not_installed\"\n          this.logs.push('error: ' + e);\n        }\n      }\n)\n\n}. This is because the secure storage plugin is not currently supported in Ionic View. A full list of supported plugins is available here: https://docs.ionic.io/tools/view/#supported-plugins.\nYou can request it be added by opening an issue here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-view-issues. @ramonornela Gotcha.

    "MattHoneycutt": "Actually, it looks like this question would apply to promises as well.  Do I need to manually call $scope.$digest or $scope.$apply?  Should something else be calling them?  Or is there another elegant solution to this problem for Angular 1.x that I'm overlooking? \n. That doesn't seem to be the case.  I'm using ionic-native 1.3.9 with Angular 1.5.7.  Here's my code using the $cordovaGeolocation plugin:\njscript\n                $cordovaGeolocation.getCurrentPosition().then(data => {\n                    console.log('Initial get completed.', data);\n                    vm.latitude = data.coords.latitude.toFixed(4);\n                    vm.longitude = data.coords.longitude.toFixed(4);\n                });\nMy console.log is executed, but my view never updates, because a digest is never triggered.  \nIf I wrap the call in $scope.$apply, the view updates as expected:\njscript\n            $cordovaGeolocation.getCurrentPosition().then(data => {\n                $scope.$apply(() => {\n                    console.log('Initial get completed.', data);\n                    vm.latitude = data.coords.latitude.toFixed(4);\n                    vm.longitude = data.coords.longitude.toFixed(4);\n                });\n            });\nAm I doing something wrong? \n. So this should work for promises now, but observables will still need a $scope.$apply wrapper, correct? \n. ",

Please create a new Issue.. @ihadeed I think we can close it because they stopped the development.. I close this issue because they stoped the development. @Manduro I will take a look into this!. @Manduro looks like this plugin is not maintained anymore.

Hey @dylanvdmerwe,\nI will add this plugin later this week.

Update to 3.10.3 and try it again. Change the version in your package.json file and run npm install. @stenrdj you run the old ionic-native package.\nFollow this guide, to upgrade to Ionic Native 3.x: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/README.md\nAnd run npm uninstall --save ionic-native to delete the old package..

Fixed with commit 134eab2dcc43cbf00aa5b63c06516dfdbe5e4636\nCan you close it @nicobytes?. Fixed: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/commit/7c6b117643bf7a01cf62f29a1aa6075b00d3b2f4. Hey @vosecek,\nthis method is implemented as you can see here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/%40ionic-native/plugins/google-maps/index.ts\nts\n  @CordovaInstance({ sync: true })\n  panBy(): void { }. Hey @tedliang-asahi, the requested methods are implemented. Check the latest native release.\nBut I added the missing keys() method.. I will create a PR for this plugin.\nI think the name phonegap-local-notifications is okay. @mene078 can you close it?. @astec can you close it? \nThe devDependencies have nothing to do with the ionic-angular dependencies.. Hey @8BallBomBom,\nI will have a look into this plugin. Hey, \nthank you for opening this Issue. Can you tell me, if you only had problems with the marker or with the whole documentation of this plugin?. Okay fine.\nIs this part required for the plugin to work?\nthis.map = new GoogleMap('map', { ... });\nIf i find some time today, I will rework the plugin doc.. My bad. I fixed it to match a common configuration. Hm, I had problems in the past when I do it like you mentioned.\nMy common config looks like this\ntypescript\n    this.appRate.preferences = {\n      openStoreInApp: true,\n      displayAppName: 'Mercy',\n      usesUntilPrompt: 3,\n      promptAgainForEachNewVersion: true,\n      storeAppURL: {\n        ios: '1134880046',\n        android: 'market://details?id=com.mytech.OverwatchStats'\n      },\n      customLocale: {\n        title: \"Rate Mercy\",\n        message: \"Help us to improve your experience with Stats for Overwatch\",\n        cancelButtonLabel: \"Pass\",\n        laterButtonLabel: \"Ask Later\",\n        rateButtonLabel: \"Rate it!\"\n      }\n    };\n    this.appRate.promptForRating(false);\nSo in your opinion it should look like\n```typescript\n this.appRate.preferences.storeAppURL = {\n   ios: '',\n   android: 'market://details?id=',\n   windows: 'ms-windows-store://review/?ProductId='\n };\nthis.appRate.preferences.usesUntilPrompt = 3;\nthis.appRate.promptForRating(false);\n```. Should I just add a short note about that fact or should I use your code?. Okay great.\nI changed it now again.. @abusharaf can you close it? I updated the app-base repo to match the latest ionic-native release 3.6.1. @jgw96 can you close this issue?. Hey @mikewagz,\nI will take a look into this.. @mikewagz,\nthe functions are now added. Wait for the next release.. @perrygovier we should also add the new CLI 3.x ionic cordova plugin add ... command. I will have a look into this.. Thank you for your quick reply.\nCan you explain how I can call the checkCordovaAvailablity method?. Okay fine. I changed it.\nCan you check the build errors so I or you can check this plugin?. Thank you again.\nI talked about the build errors when I run npm run build.. Hey @SebastianSchirmer,\nI will take a look into this.. I added the missing options.\nThank you for creating that issue.\nAnd the toolbarColor is valid, I checked the plugin source.\nfinal String toolbarColor = options.optString(\"toolbarColor\");. First if all upgrade your native core package to 3.6.1\nAnd I can't see the geolocation package. Are you sure you installed it correctly?. Sorry I meand the other native plugins but I can't see your geolocation plugin in your package.json\nbash\nionic plugin add --save cordova-plugin-geolocation\nnpm install --save @ionic-native/geolocation\n. @ihadeed fixed. @ihadeed how should I change the return type? Change it to Cordova { sync: true }?. @ihadeed fixed. Hey @naveedahmed1,\nI will implement this plugin later this week.. @naveedahmed1 will be added in the next release: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/pull/1501. @bergben I will take a look at the plugin.. @bergben I added the changes and the new source. Wait for the next release. @MattDHill let me take a look :). Hey @naveedahmed1, I will check that problem later. Maybe I did something wrong.. Hey @YD1722, you should upgrade the native-core plugin by running npm install @ionic-native/core@latest\nThis will fix your error.. Hey @dylanvdmerwe,\nthe example is wrong. The right method is called viewDocument().\nI fixed it and your second question too (no array).. Hey @petrot,\nbecause ionic-native just wraps the Cordova plugins, we can't resolve this issue by our side.. Hey @robinbonnes,\nthis plugin is on my list! . @robinbonnes I will add this plugin today. They release version 1.0 last week. @ihadeed can be closed. @aidan2129 from the plugin page: \n\nDatePicker Plugin for Cordova/PhoneGap 4.0 (iOS and Android and Windows). Ah okay, now I understand the problem.\nWe should add this to the docs.. Im closing this issue because the requested plugin is no longer maintained.. Im closing this issue because tis plugin is not longer maintained.. Do you talk about the Cordova CLI or about the Ionic CLI? You have to run ionic cordova plugin add XYZ\n\nBut because there is no native wrapper you have to follow the official repo docs to use the plugin.. You installed the old ionic native package.\nRun npm uninstall --save ionic-native. And you also installed native 3.10.3 but the latest release is 3.10.2. You don't understand my answer. You installed now the old ionic native package again. Uninstall it as I told you and read the documentation for the new ionic native 3.x releases.\n. @ihadeed you can assign me if you want to add the plugins.\n@arsewizz but you can always use the firebase web ask to access all the firebase functions. But I will take a look into your suggested plugins.. @arsewizz I try to implement the plugins this week.. Can you update your native packages to 3.10.2 and test it again?. Hey @tgensol,\nas you can see from the plugin repo page, the function wants one parameter (options) and can return a success or error callback. \njavascript\n  show: function (options, onSuccess, onError) {\n    options = options || {};\n    if (!options.hasOwnProperty('animated')) {\n      options.animated = true;\n    }\n    exec(onSuccess, onError, \"SafariViewController\", \"show\", [options]);\n  },\nhttps://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller/blob/master/www/SafariViewController.js#L12. @surajrao I added the missing function. Wait for the next release. @ihadeed done!. @ihadeed sure. @AlGantori as you can read in the given error log the package.json file is missing in the source repo:\n\nIs now failing with Cordova 7.0.0 because the repo (VersoSolutions/CordovaClipboard) does not have a package.json\n\nYou should open a Issue there. @AlGantori You can install the plugin if you downgrade your cordova cli back to 6.5. Plugin added. @neoassyrian There are still CI errors (build).\nHave you run the commands npm run lintand npm run build to test the changes locally?. Update your dependencies to theirs latest releases and try it again.. Check out the latest ionic release notes for release 4.3.x.\nThen,run npm outdated to see the latest available releases.\nThe latest release for ionic native packages are 3.12.x. This plugin is out of date. Can you provide me an up-to-date fork? Then I will take a look into this plugin this week.. Im closing this issue because of duplicated feature request.. @niconaso You can use it already without a new ionic-native release if you want to use it ^^ You build the package so just copy the plugin to your node_modules folder. This has nothing tondo with Ionic native.. Report it here (the source repo): https://github.com/sebastianbaar/cordova-plugin-nativegeocoder. We don't have to document this because this step is the same for every ionic-native plugin and already documented here: https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/.

Hey @frizzkitten,\nI checked the official plugin docs and can't find an instruction to use this plugin like that.. Wait for the next V5 beta or v4 feature release this or next week.. Looks good, thank you \ud83d\udc4d . The Ionic View App does not support all Cordova plugins. You can find all supported plugins here: https://ionicframework.com/docs/pro/view.html#plugin-support. We removed the google-maps plugin from this repo. You can create a new PR here: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native-google-maps. We will release Ionic Native V5 together with Ionic V4. If you need rxjs 6 support you can use the latest v5 beta.. You can create your own intro screen with slides. A plugin is not required.. Our role is not to maintain the plugins by ourself but with the help of the community. Im doing this for low without self-interest. Fell free to open a PR for breaking wrappers.. Sorry but we can\u2019t maintain over 200 repository\u2019s. I can understand your problem but it is not possible.. It's completely different to maintain one project containing 200 plugins in one place or 200 repositories.. If you change the JSDO style to the corrct form, I will merge your PR\nts\n/**\n/**\n     * Create a dot.\n     * @param {number} x - The x value.\n     * @param {number} y - The y value.\n     * @param {number} width - The width of the dot, in pixels.\n     */\n    constructor(x, y, width) {\n        // ...\n    }. The change is not required but I want to follow the official JSDOC guidelines. You have to wait for the next release to install this plugin with npm. But I can not tell you when we publish a new release. Maybe this week. I will do the squash merge \ud83d\ude04 You can spam as many commits as you want \ud83d\ude00 . You have to upgrade to Angular 5. Please pay attention to your pronunciation.\nThis is not related to our native wrapper. Please open a new issue here: https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-cordova. Not related to this repository.. You have to set the NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key by yourself as Apple mentioned.\nRead more about it here: https://medium.com/collaborne-engineering/cordova-ios-10-nscamerausagedescription-missing-fbcbe5e41565. And please follow our pull request guidelines: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#commit-message-format. I\u2019m closing this issue. The sac app supports following  plugins: https://ionicframework.com/docs/pro/devapp/. I will keep that in mind. Thanks for your feedback.. I disagree to add this function to our native wrappers. We wrap native plugins functions and not helper/utility functions that you can write by your self.. I added the beta flag. If your plugin is ready for production (1.0.0 release) I will remove it.. Please fix the build errors. I try to release a new v4 release this week.. Ionic Native v4 supports nodes 8 not 10. V5 is fine with Node 10. Have you tried this on a native device or in your browser, because not all plugins support the browser platform.. Check out the supported plugins here: https://ionicframework.com/docs/pro/devapp/\nThe Diagnostic plugin is not supported.. You have to change your imports to \"import { Geolocation } from '@ionic-native/splashscreen/ngx'\" and so on (Read more here: https://blog.ionicframework.com/help-test-ionic-native-5/)\nIf you still have problems you can use ionic native v4 together with \"rxjs-compat\".. Sorry, I updated my comment with the correct import and the blog post.. Please update to beta 14. The contacts plugin is deprecated. Maybe thats the problem: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts#deprecation-notice\nBut also check out the iOS guide here: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts#ios-quirks. This has nothing to do with the ionic native wrapper. Please open an issue at the plugin source repository.. Have you tried the app on your native device?. Fixed. Are you sure you installed the latest @beta release? Also Import the Plugin in the app.module.ts. Why do you install the beta version? We released V5 last week.. Just run npm install @ionic-native/status-bar as described in the documentation.. Have you also updated the native/core dependency? Please post your package.json file so I can take a look.. Okay, looks like a \"legacy\" ionic 2 app.\nYou have to upgrade all ionic-native related dependencies to there latest releases. You also have to update rxjs to version 6. Because you are on Angular 2 you have to install the rxjs compat dependency.\nI would recommend you to upgrade to Ionic 4 or 3 if it's possible.  I wrote a guide here on how to do that.. Have you imported it like this: @ionic-native/google-plus/ngx?. Looks like because the file is definitely fixed. I will publish another beta release later this week.. I added the @beta tag to the docs. @perrygovier will fix the usage sections.. cc @mlynch can you take a look for me?. You installed the wrong version. You have to install the beta release:\nnpm install @ionic-native/geolocation@beta. Please fix the circle errors. Thanks for the update \ud83d\udc4d . You habe to Uwe ng v5 becaise ionic 3 dopendes on Angular 5.. Because you have not installed the @beta module.\nnpm install --save @ionic-native/screen-orientation@beta.. If you have to use rxjs6 you need to install the @beta native packages (ionic-native v5).. Please remove the package-lock.json file from the PR.. Should be fixed.. Both depending on Angular 5. I release a patch release every week and a feature release every two weeks. Your PR is fine.. Feel free to create a PR. Actually I don't have enough time to add new plugins by my self.. Follow the Developer Guide: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md. The documentation is clear. Follow other plugin wrappers as examples. Your linked article is about creating a native plugin with Cordova but you have to write an ionic wrapper, not the plugin itself.. Please upgrade to the latest beta. Why do you use beta 1 and not the latest?. Thanks!. You have to upgrade to angular 5. Thanks for the update.. You have to use the @beta npm-tag. For example:\nnpm install @ionic-native/camera@beta.. You have to use Angular 5. I have to rewrite the plugin wrapper. I will do this after my vacation next week.. I will merge your PR but I would appreciate if you could add the jsdoc in a separate PR.. Please remove the other plugin from this PR.. You have to update to Angular 5. You have to install the Plugin Beta Version: @ionic-native/printer@beta. Fixed. Feel free to create a PR. Currently I have no time to add plugins myself,. The v5 Beta is already stable. We just call it beta because of the ionic v4 beta.\nif you still want to use native v4 you have to use the rxjs-compat package for backward compatibility.. You have to upgrade to Angular 5. In your package.jaon you posted I can see your Angular version \ud83d\ude2c . Thanks for the hint.. You have to install the beta version of this plugin wrapper:\nnpm install --save @ionic-native/ms-adal@beta. You are targeting the master branch that uses rxjs 5 and Angular 5. On v5 everything is fine.. Have you installed the beta version of the push plugin wrapper?. Thanks for the update.. Yes I fixed is yesterday. I will release beta 21 today.. The Linter don't like this jsdoc style. Please change it to\n/**\n * Lorem ipsum\n */. You have to import the Plugin from this path: import { Keyboard } from '@ionic-native/keyboard/ngx';. Nope. I merge master into v5 after every new release.. The function have been changed. Please check out the docs or this commit: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/2743/files. You have to use the beta branch like the pre installed plugin wrappers.. No problem :). You have to use ionic native v5. Please read the beta docs carefully.. Loks like they remove this two functions.. Because you are the maintainer of the plugin you should be able to add typing information to the return types.. Use ionic native v5 to use rxjs 6 or install the rxjs-compat backward compatible package.. The Camera plugin is not supported in the browser.. No its fine. I will merge all open PR's tomorrow.. ping @mlynch . Done. Thanks for your fix. Did not see that.. Checkout the updated docs. You  have to import the plugin now from @ionic-native/app-version/ngx. Feel free to open a PR to add this feature :)\nThat's the sense of Open Source.. Thanks for the update. I reverted my changes for now.. Please add typescript to the markup ```typescript. The usage part is a bit to short. Can you describe the plugin a bit more? Orientate you by other plugins.\nDon't put the plugin method call in to the constructor.. I tried it but it didn't work. I also had some problems with the file plugin. Good point. I want to unify the plugins if they download the files from GitHub.\nIf you try to download the files without .git, GitHub redirects to the .git file.. I will fix that. And if you open an .git link, GitHub redirects to the repo page without .git. And the official Cordova docs also linking to the .git links.. Change this line to @param filePath {string} Absolute file path. remove this line. Add a space between the comment indicator and your comment\n// Comment. fixed. Remove the unneeded comments. Is the return type an object or an Date/string?. Yes :). add supported platforms (e.g platforms: ['Android', 'iOS']). Change JSDOC to @param {type} param description. Change JSDOC to @param {type} param description. Broken JSDOC. why is this necessary because an plain string is printed. Don't bump our dependencies. Missing jsdoc. Please remove the changes for the keyboard plugin from your PR. Remove. Remove all package-lock.json changes. Remove this file. Remove. Remove. Remoce unused lines of code. Please remove this change. rename services to uuids. That's true for Android but not for iOS.\nAn iOS version code can look like this \"1.2.3.4\". Change the name to LastCam.. Add typings. Please provide the correct typings as an interface.. Remove the placeholder comments. Add the correct interface as response type and remove any. Please provide a better description. I'm not that familiar with Chinese so I don't know the difference between this plugin and the Cordova geolocation plugin.. Add a description. Add an example. Describe the function and edit the jsdoc. Add a description. Add an example. Remove boilerplate comments. Remove boilerplate comments here and the other functions. Move interfaces to the top. Remove this change. Update the import path.\nimport { AdvanceFilePicker } from '@ionic-native/advance-file-picker/ngx';. ",

    "tkem": "Well, isn't this how observables are supposed to work? Like Angular 2 Http, for example? You can always turn this into a \"hot\" observable using publish/connect...\n. Probably, though I guess in this case an Observable was used because the Toast.show() success handler might be called multiple times if the toast is tapped: https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin#receiving-a-callback-when-a-toast-is-tapped\nWhether this is good interface design in the first place is debatable, of course.\n. I tried out native Toast myself for the first time right now, and besides having to subscribe for the Toast to be shown, I think (please correct me if I'm wrong) I also have to unsubscribe manually to prevent resource leaks.\nI would have assumed the observable to complete automatically when the Toast disappears, but this does not seem to be the case.\nHowever, as soon as I unsubscribe the toast gets hidden (clearFunction: 'hide'), so the best thing I could come up with quickly is something like\nToast.show(message, duration.toString(), position).timeout(duration).subscribe(\n  result => console.log('Toast shown or clicked', result),\n  error => console.log('Toast error or timeout', error),\n  () => console.log('Toast complete (never gets called)')\n);\nso the observable times out automatically after the same duration as set for the toast.\nI'd really like to hear that I'm completely wrong here...\n. Thanks a lot!\n. @wanjungao: What makes you think it would return a Promise<boolean>? It's declared as Promise<any>, and the docs make it quite clear there's no boolean state involved:\nhttps://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-ble-central#isenabled\n. Exactly. The failure callback of a Cordova plugin always results in an error, which you can catch. I agree this is not very intuitive in this case, but ionic-native is just a wrapper for plugins, and does not (and IMHO should not) change basic functionality. In this case, it might be better if the plugin passes a boolean to its success callback, and reserves failure for true errors. But that's beyond the scope of ionic-native. \n. Wasn't this fixed with ac748abf789d2732a9a335f8fb2ba7c64f661fc3?. I'm having similar issues with the BLE plugin. My current guess is that change detection is not triggered at all for methods returning Observables. See also https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/does-ionic-native-really-ensure-that-native-events-trigger-change-detection-in-angular-2/69993\n. @ihadeed: It's a viable workaround when using the Observable directly as a component input, though http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/02/22/angular-2-change-detection-explained.html#observables suggests that markForCheck() may still be needed. Using an async pipe will work around even this. too.\nStill, AFAICS ionic-native claims to ensure change detection is triggered \"automatically\" for Observables right on its front page: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native#promises-and-observables; to me, that suggests a behavior similar to DOM events, or Promises as provided by the zone.js wrappers.\n. Any news on this? I still see ionic-native making claims about \"easy to use plugins with Angular change detection\" on its front page.... Great news, @ihadeed, thank you!\n. Updated and rebased on master.. Thank you for maintaining this and making life a little easier for all of us ;-)\n. Sure, sorry. I see both @return and @returns in other plugins - does this make any difference?. Right.. Rationale, please?. I copied this style from the BLE plugin, and you're right, this isn't rendered in the docs page, too.\nDo I guess this should be changed for at least the BLE plugin also, and probably other plugins are affected, too.. Yes, it's complicated ;-)\nThanks, I really think it is easier for people who actually know/use zeroconf that way, even if \"ZeroConf\" looks more natural first!\nAnd I don't want to call this plugin @ionic-native/zero-conf (which would have to change, too, I guess) because that looks just funny...\n.

Is actually anyone able to get this one to work? \nhttps://github.com/ghenry22/cordova-chromecast\nCant get the PlayServices to be linked correctly.\nOr does someone know any other solution?\n. @ayyfish  did you may got an example project?\nIt compiles fine - but detects no devices.\n. @ayyfish \nYeah, actually porting one of my hobby projects from xamarin to ionic2. \nMy Xamarin App finds my Chromecast and Fire Stick without any issues.\nCould be that im doing something realy stupid within typescript. How do you actually access connectsdk? By just calling cordova.plugins.ConnectSDK.discoveryManager.startDiscovery();  etc?\n. @ghenry22  Could be that you also having old playservices installed? Folder structure changed thats why the forked one doesnt work.\nBut yeah, an example of connect sdk or the forked one would be realy great. To ensure im not doing something very stupid currently...\n. @ihadeed  actually got it working. Works fawlessly for me, using connectsdk 1.6.\nHeres an example code:\n```\n    testConnectSDK(){\n        navigator['ConnectSDK'].discoveryManager.pickDevice().success(function (device) {\n        function sendVideo () {\n            device.getMediaPlayer().playMedia(\"http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4\", \"video/mp4\");\n        }\n    if (device.isReady()) { // already connected\n        sendVideo();\n    } else {\n        device.on(\"ready\", sendVideo);\n        device.connect();\n    }\n})\n}\n\n```\nAs you can see, im just using the navigator way... would realy appreciate an ionic-native implementation :)\n. Same question here, is it even possible?\nSpecificly wanted to add chromecast and amazon fling sdk.\n. Yeah, ive actually just used 1.3.27, fixed it for me.

Hopefully as these are just warnings of a lower required version than the one installed things should actually be fine.  But this is still something that shouldn't happen.  There is clearly a conflict of rxjs dependency between ionic-native and the angular stuff.. documentation wasn't clear enough that you now need to inject all your providers as with any other dependency, this wasn't the case before.. @ihadeed Actually no that's not what I meant.

For local files cordova-file-plugin uses different strategy (https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/master/www/FileReader.js#L268) and maybe this is the root cause of integration issue between cordova-file-plugin and zone.js..

I am using zone.js v0.6.25 at the moment, with ionic-angular v2.0.0-rc.1 and ionic-native v2.2.3\nI tried the workaround and the events are now firing on ios, but then I recieve and have to workaround this error on android. \nUncaught TypeError: i.readAsArrayBuffer is not a function\nThis is still an open issue for ionic-native.\n. @ihadeed I'm definitely going to be testing both of these plugins so I can give you a heads up as to +/- of using each. The AlexDisler plugin is not supported, but so far it has worked for me except in one edge case where the user has to change his/her billing information on itunes while purchasing.\nAnything specific you need help with on implementation? Or just testing?. @ihadeed So I'm playing with the new plugin and I have run into a bit of an issue. Not sure what direction you were trying to take here.\nLooking at the documentation, this is how I would expect to register the IAPProductEvents, but the typings are not playing nice with this.\njs\n    this.store.when(productId).approved( (product: IAPProduct) => {\n      // Purchase was approved\n      alert('Approved');\n      product.finish();\n    });\nWhile you're implementation says that the function approved returns a function (product: IAPProduct) => void\nI'll look into editing it.. So editing them, the ts was,\njs\n    owned: (product: IAPProduct) => void;\nand now should be\njs\n    approved: (callback: IAPQueryCallback) => void;\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/1705. @ihadeed I could definitely use your help figuring this plugin out. Since there are so many bugs or related issues I'm not sure what is our problem and what is a problem with the plugin.\nFor example, I have I think configured everything correctly but when I do a \njs\n        this.store.register({\n          id: productId,\n          alias: productId,\n          type: this.store.NON_RENEWING_SUBSCRIPTION\n        });\nWhich seems legit, but I when i check there are no products registered.\njs\n      this.store.ready((status) => {\n        console.log(JSON.stringify(this.store.get(productId)));\n        console.log('Store is Ready: ' + JSON.stringify(status));\n        console.log('Products: ' + JSON.stringify(this.store.products));\n      });\n// Prints : Products: []\nEdit / Update: Figured it out. Made a pull request! It looks like the full process is working but lots of edge cases to test still.. Yup, it was just that the register function was not synched with the Cordova functionality.. @ihadeed Is there a plan for when this could be released as a \"supported\" plugin? I am using it currently in my live app if there is testing that needs to be done. . That's a good question... \nMaybe you should call it in-app-purchase-promise and in-app-purchase-events seeing as one is promise based and the other is event callback based... \nI don't know. To give you some of my experience with the whole thing, both of the plugins worked when everything went well, but I have found that this plugin helps me cover a few more edge cases that the other plugin. Plus my code definitely looks quite a bit more simple. Example: \nts\n\u00a0this.inAppPurchase.getProducts([productId])\n          .then( (products) => {\n            this.inAppPurchase.buy(productId).then( (data) => {\n              console.log('Data', data);\n              this.logger.logEvent('purchase', { programId: this.program._id });\n              return this.inAppPurchase.consume(data.productType, data.receipt, data.signature);\n            }).then( () => {\n              loader.dismiss();\n              console.log('Consumed Product!');\n              this.subscribe();\n            }).catch( (err) => {\n              // Validate Purchase through backend?\n              // Look for cases where the app paused\n              if (this.platform.is('ios')) {\n                this.platform.resume.first().subscribe( (event) => {\n                  console.log('App Coming Back from Pause');\n                  this.inAppPurchase.getReceipt().then( (purchases) => {\n                    console.log('Get Reciept Purchases');\n                    console.log(JSON.stringify(purchases));\n                    this.billing.getReceiptInfo(purchases).subscribe( (receipts) => {\n                      console.log('returned: ' , JSON.stringify(receipts) );\n                      // Find if a transaction has taken place in the last 10 minutes (1000 * 60 * 10)\n                      let found = false;\n                      let currentTransaction;\n                      _.forEach( receipts, (transaction) => {\n                        if (transaction.productId === this.program.appleProductId) {\n                           if (Math.abs( Date.now() - transaction.purchaseDateMs) < 600000) {\n                              found = true;\n                              currentTransaction = transaction;\n                           };\n                        }\n                      });\n                      if (found) {\n                        this.logger.logEvent('consumed_after_pause', {});\n                        loader.dismiss();\n                        console.log('Consumed Product!');\n                        this.subscribe();\n                      } else {\n                        this.toastCtrl.create({\n                          message: 'No current purchase found.

Hmm I'm using a pretty standard ionic2 app setup, and I have no zone.js script - is it not bundled up into the main.js?. I had a bit more success with this by wrapping everything in a this.platform.ready().then(()=>{}). It now seems to reliably call the onloadend callback.\nHowever I'm not really sure why I need to do this. My use of FileReader is not anywhere near to app startup time so there should be no issue with the platform being ready or not. Perhaps this.platform.ready actually does something more complicated than the documentation eludes to? From looking at the source NgZone does seem to be involved, so perhaps that is the issue/solution?. So, I've found a fix (I think) is to re-order the index.html of your app so that the polyfills.js (which includes zone.js and a few other things) is included before cordova.js. This seems to make it work reliably for me. Presumably this gives some clue as to what's going on, something to do with how zone.js patches things?. It would be good if someone from Ionic could tell us if this is a safe change to make. Presumably there was a reason why that order of script tags was chosen. I've done some very light testing but would be good to get the official word.. I don't really understand why this (and similar) issues have been closed.

Can you put this is in the documentation? I am seeing people use both Geolocation and BackgroundGeolocation to accomplish their goals. \n. So I wonder if it is still best practice to use Geolocation with BackgroundGeolocation? Will the next version of ionic native combine the two plugins? I think clarification should be made on Geolocation versus BackgroundGeolocation and how each are affected when app permissions change. Would make more sense to combine them and have one tracking plugin. I am constantly seeing people build ionic apps using both plugins, thus the need to update the documentation about calling BackgroundGeolocation before Geolocation. If you use both and don't do this then the app will never ask for background tracking permission. \n. @ihadeed I am talking hypothetically it would be a nice feature. Mainly this issue was about the problems that occurred when using both background geolocation and geolocation within the same application. The background geolocation plugin needs to be placed within app.ts before geolocation or it will not ask for the correct permissions. This is about just placing that note within the documentation. \n. You need to import the  ionic native plugin and use it instead.\nhttp://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/geolocation/\n. It would appear that typings are missing somewhere for the ionic native file plugin and cordova. I noticed that File.resolveDirectoryUrl does not actually exist as a function anywhere etc. Logging cordova.file will work, but using the ionic native plugin will not.. Update: I found that if i set a variable as let filepath = cordova.file.dataDirectory\nThen convert it to a string with let path = filepath.toString()\nThen pass it to on of the methods like create directory it works. The docs are wrong and confusing for this plugin as it's looking for a string, but is always being passed in object. However, this only works after the device is ready, so it can't be used on any other component except the app component. :(. ",

After that I removed the node_modules folder and did a new npm install\nSo there is no ionic-native installed, but as you can see in app.component.ts there is used StatusBar and Splashscreen from ioni-native which is not installed anymore.\n```\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Platform } from 'ionic-angular';\nimport { StatusBar, Splashscreen } from 'ionic-native';\nimport { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home';\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: 'app.html'\n})\nexport class MyApp {\n  rootPage = HomePage;\nconstructor(platform: Platform) {\n    platform.ready().then(() => {\n      // Okay, so the platform is ready and our plugins are available.\n      // Here you can do any higher level native things you might need.\n      StatusBar.styleDefault();\n      Splashscreen.hide();\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\non running now ionic serve from terminal I get no error! But I think the builder should give an error or not? The app.component.ts could not find import from ionic-native. but there is now error.\nOn loading app in browser finally I get the error\nRuntime Error\nCannot find module \"ionic-native\"\nThis should be more an error from ionic-cli than from ionic-native?

I was thrown as I found many different ways to do this on the net (including your docs). All differed. I recommend adding something to your docs for this\n1) use ionic to add the plugin\nionic plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage\n2) add ionic-native either through bower or npm (both are the same, right?)\n3) Add ionic-native as a module dependency \nangular.module('app', [\n  'ionic',\n  'ionic.native'\n])\n4) Inject the service\nfunction MyController($ionicPlatform, $cordovaSQLite) {\n5) use the new API after $ionicPlatform.ready\n```\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function () {\n  console.log('PLATFORM READY');\n// Just a test to make sure the plugin is there in case the wrapper is not working\n  // var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({ name: 'demo.db', location: 'default' });\nvar db = new $cordovaSQLite();\n  db.openDatabase({ name: \"my.db\", location: \"default\" })\n    .then(function (r, p) {\n      console.log('Opened database', r, p);\n    })\n    .catch(function (r, p) {\n      console.log('Unable to open database', err);\n    });\n});\n```\n.

After reading https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/pull/1442/commits/89b2725c4f19ea4ac4bdc5a63048af1475b740a1?diff=split, one of the steps to push XCode in the right direction is to include a SWIFT_VERSION = 2.3; line in the buildSettings block for each plugin in the project.pbxproj file. Once this is done, XCode stops complaining about the version.\nIn this example (with Geofence), adding this property is all that is needed to get the build to compile and emulate. I haven't tested the actual functionality, but I assume that the plugin would work.\nHere is what an upgraded project.pbxproj file looks like: (4 occurrences of SWIFT_VERSION)\n```\n// !$UTF8$!\n{\n

Interesting - on a more complex app (with 14 Cordova/IN plugins) there are still only 4 buildSettings directives in the project.pbxproj file. Adding the SWIFT_VERSION tag to these 4 spots will make the app compile, but one of the plugins (https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-zeroconf) fails due to Swift syntax errors.\n. Alright, project compiles properly after settings SWIFT_VERSION = 3.0 in the project.pbxproj file.\nNext step is figuring out how to get the SWIFT_VERSION line in that file by default.\n. @dlowrey https://github.com/becvert/cordova-plugin-zeroconf doesn't have a browser version ,and you are serving the browser platform with ionic serve and DevApp. Consider using a provider factory pattern to avoid loading non-browser plugins in browser environments.. @Jdrew001 (and everyone else) this is a very common problem with apps that are not installed properly, when package versions are incorrect, or where users are building for target platforms that are not supported by the desired plugin.\nEach commenters problem may be a bit different depending on the state of their local packages.\nThis might sound counterintuitive, but it would be a great help if folks could create new issues with a similar title as this but referencing the plugin they are having trouble with. In doing so, users are prompted to fill out vital information that makes it easier and faster for devs to identify potential problems and help users to find a resolution.\nFor example, @Jdrew001 I see that https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/native-page-transitions/ says that it only supports Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 8 platforms (specifically NOT desktop browsers), so my first question for you is  this: How are you building your app when you get this error? Are you running ionic serve, are you emulating the app in a virtual machine, or are you running the app directly on a mobile device?. @Jdrew001 Excellent, thank you for sharing! This ionic serve is the source of your problem.\nDevApp only makes the desktop (browser) version available on mobile devices - \"native\" Cordova plugins do not build in this arrangement. The other two plugins likely have browser compatibility or polyfills to prevent errors on this platform.\nOut of curiosity, what are the other two native plugins that you are successfully running?. @Jdrew001 glad to hear! Any chance you can share your solution here in case anyone else comes across this thread? Even if the solution is unrelated it might help other users while they search.. @charlesCaballero I created a working File Chooser demo for you: https://github.com/emcniece/ionic-filechooser-demo\nGive this a test - it works for me on Android 8.0. Please ensure that you are actually running the .apk app on Android and not with ionic serve, Ionic DevApp or Ionic View.\nIf you continue to have problems, please open a new issue - it will help devs troubleshoot your code faster and more accurately..

This will (very hopefully) be resolved by https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/2089. @AmitMY can you share the results of an npm ls rxjs from your app directory? I am curious if this problem is caused by having multiple rxjs versions in various packages.\nI see that ionic-native is already using rxjs 5.5.2, yet my repo shows the same errors. Here's my npm ls rxjs output:\n\u2717 npm ls rxjs\naurora-app@1.2.0-beta.3 /Users/emcniece/Code/ionic/aurora-app\n\u251c\u2500\u252c aurora-js@1.0.0 -> /Users/emcniece/Code/nodejs/aurorajs\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u252c rx-http-request@1.2.0\n\u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 rxjs@5.4.0  deduped\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 rxjs@5.4.0\n\u251c\u2500\u252c ionic-native@2.9.0\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 rxjs@5.0.1\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 rxjs@5.5.2. Aha... figured it out. We have a deprecated version of ionic-native installed!\nWe no longer need the ionic-native module - we just need @ionic-native/core.\nRunning npm uninstall ionic-native --save builds successfully.. @AmitMY your shared package.json doesn't explicitly list ionic-native as an included package, but the paths in your screenshot indicate that this module is present in your system.

All properties defined as GoogleMapsLatLng don't work for me.\nEven setting up GoogleMap with the camera property doesn't work.\nI created a new ionic2 project, and followed http://www.joshmorony.com/integrating-native-google-maps-into-an-ionic-2-application/ to reproduce it.\nThis throws an error:\n```\nlet location = new GoogleMapsLatLng(-34.9290,138.6010);\nthis.map = new GoogleMap('map', {\n  'backgroundColor': 'white',\n  'controls': {\n    'compass': true,\n    'myLocationButton': true,\n    'indoorPicker': true,\n    'zoom': true\n  },\n  'gestures': {\n    'scroll': true,\n    'tilt': true,\n    'rotate': true,\n    'zoom': true\n  },\n  'camera': {\n    'latLng': location,\n    'tilt': 30,\n    'zoom': 15,\n    'bearing': 50\n  }\n});\n```\nRemoving the 'camera' property fixes the problem.\n. Reverting ionic-native to the default version 2.0.3 fixes the problem (https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/package.json)\n. Thanks @ihadeed It works now.\n. Do you mean File.resolveLocalFilesystemUrl?\nThe FileChooser plugins doesn't return a file:// , but a content:// uri.\nI'm unable to use File.resolveLocalFilesystemUrl with that:\nTypeError\n    at file:///android_asset/www/build/main.js:24:17305\n    at new t (file:///android_asset/www/build/polyfills.js:3:15614)\n    at Function.t.resolveLocalFilesystemUrl (file:///android_asset/www/build/main.js:24:17268)\n    at file:///android_asset/www/build/main.js:27:16006\n    at t.invoke (file:///android_asset/www/build/polyfills.js:3:13400)\n    at Object.onInvoke (file:///android_asset/www/build/main.js:7:389)\n    at t.invoke (file:///android_asset/www/build/polyfills.js:3:13351)\n    at e.run (file:///android_asset/www/build/polyfills.js:3:10787)\n    at file:///android_asset/www/build/polyfills.js:3:8889\n    at t.invokeTask (file:///android_asset/www/build/polyfills.js:3:14029)\nWith the filepath plugin I can convert the content:// uri to it's native file:// uri:\nreturn FileChooser.open()\n  .then((uri) => {\n    console.log(uri); // content://com.android.providers.downloads.documents/document/15\n    window.FilePath.resolveNativePath(uri, (filePath) => {\n      console.log(filePath); // file:///storage/emulated/0/Download/demo.docx\n    }, () => {\n    });\n  });\nOr am I missing something?\n.

This wouldn't be an issue were the plugin installed from npm, since the .npmignore would prevent the some-plugin.ts file from being uploaded but it's a pain while developing.  But yea, once I did all that, sure...everything works great but not very pleasant for the plugin's consumer having to provide a relative-url.\nAnyway, this is an issue that should be taken up with ionic-cli.

My gosh, I think I found the root reason of my above problem regarding FileReader\nThe thing is, I was still referencing cordova.js in my index.html, therefore Cordova was included twice (https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/15143) because with Ionic v4 / Angular v6, Cordova will actually be added automatically at bundle time to index.html (if I understand correctly)\nRemoving this explicit call to cordova.js in my index.html file solve the issue.

Definition of a falsey value\nIf in doubt, look at the source code. I agree with @EddyVerbruggen: i.e. your proposal should seek to engage existing/potential 3rd party plugin developers to share in the burden and the profits. \nAs the author of several plugins currently wrapped by Ionic Native (Diagnostic, Launch Navigator, Location Accuracy, SQLite Porter), I've spent probably hundreds of hours over the past few years developing and maintaining these for the benefit of the community, as well as for my own needs.\nMyself, I have no interest in monetising my plugins via \"premium\" versions as some plugin authors have chosen to do, but at the same time I (and probably other plugin devs) would be a little miffed if you took my beloved plugins and starting selling them for a profit from which I didn't benefit. I think if you do go down this route, sharing any profits with plugin authors/contributors would be the fair thing to do, even if those authors are not being motivated by money.\nAnother way to look at this is that some plugins are quite specialised and their authors have an in-depth knowledge of a specific area which may be a lot for you to take on yourselves, if you are also dealing with many other plugins. In this instance, it would be better to engage that plugin author with his specific area of knowledge to continue maintaining/extending the plugin.\nOK, that's my 5 cents worth :). @mlynch I agree that simply paying money to the original plugin author regardless of whether they continue to maintain/develop the plugin is not a solution. There would need to be some motivation for them to make time to work on it, be that financial or reputational. In the case where a plugin is maintained by more than 1 author, the proceeds should be allocated to the contributor who added the feature or fixed the issue. Some kind of work-incentivized reward system (like feeding mice cheese when they make it to the end of the maze). \nI think if you can figure out how to cut an active plugin author in on your monthly proceeds, you can effectively have a whole bunch of plugin drones working for you on the premise they'll receive some nice cheese.\nNot sure how that could be implemented either though :) . > and building an apk, i got some error about style??\nPosting the error would be helpful.. Since you are using the Ionic Native Typescript wrapper for the plugin, you should be using the returned promise for the success/error callbacks:\nthis.sqlitePorter.importJsonToDb(this.database, json)\n  .then(() => console.log('Imported'))\n  .catch(e => console.error(e));. Duplicate of #2540 . This is the behaviour that Apple intends for iOS, in order to prevent users harassed by apps to allow a particular permission: if the user turns off location services twice and the app requests to turn it back on twice, iOS assumes the user meant to keep location services turned off and therefore prevents the app from showing the system settings dialog again. This is similar to the [iOS Cancel button caveat](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-request-location-accuracy#ios-cancel-button-caveat).\n\nTherefore, there's nothing that the plugin (or any native iOS code) can do to override this.\nI would also point out that, though the outlined steps to reproduce this are possible, a real user is very unlikely to follow them: i.e. intentionally manually disable Location Services twice then re-enable via the Settings dialog.. This was raised against the plugin as https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/324 and fixed in plugin v4.0.10. The LAUNCH_MODE constants are defined by the JS plugin API but not currently exposed in the Ionic Native Typescript wrapper. This is a documented caveat of using the location accuracy plugin on iOS - see iOS \"Cancel\" button caveat: \n\niOS assumes that if the user pressed \"Cancel\", they don't want your app to use their location, so iOS prevents you from asking them again to switch on Location Services.\n\nIf Location Services is switched off, then isLocationEnabled() will return false. Therefore if the user pressed Cancel, there's no way you can tell that; you can only tell that Location Services is still off.\nNote that in my experience, this is an extremely uncommon real-world situation: most iOS users don't even know where to find Location Services, let alone making the decision to turn it off. Those that do are probably informed enough to know of the consequences without your app trying to detect it and tell them.\n. Using cordova-diagnostic-plugin-example:\nLocation Services ON:\n\n\nLocation Services: OFF:\n\n. > I can confirm without ionic-webview it is not making any request for location permission in IOS.\nYour code above is wrong: you are calling getLocationAuthorizationStatus() and if the resulting status is denied or not_detemined, you are calling locationAccuracy.canRequest() and locationAccuracy.request() and expecting this to request \"location permission\", but this is not the purpose of the location accuracy plugin.\nThe location accuracy plugin on iOS requests the system dialog which provides the Settings button in order to manually re-enable Location Services - it does not request \"location permission\" (authorization) - this should be done using requestLocationAuthorization() from cordova-diagnostic-plugin.  \nPlease see this screen capture which demonstrates the plugin working fine on iOS 12 using the example project. As can be seen in the video clip, the system dialog is correctly shown and this works even if the app has not yet requested/been granted location authorization.\n. @indraraj26 \n\nThat means first i have to call requestLocationAuthorization then i should make a request for location accuracy popup.\n\nIf Location Services is OFF then you can't tell if your app has location authorization or not, so the best flow is:\n\ncheck if Location Services is ON or OFF using diagnostic.isLocationEnabled()\nif OFF, use the location accuracy plugin (locationAccuracy.canRequest() => locationAccuracy.request()) to request the system dialog which allows users to manually turn it ON via Settings \nsince the user pressing the \"Settings\" button in the dialog switches to the Settings app, your app is put into the background, so on your app resuming from background (resume event), you should re-check if Location Services  is ON or OFF using diagnostic.isLocationEnabled().\nonce you know Location Services is ON, you can then check if your app has location authorization (permission) using diagnostic.isLocationAuthorized().\nif it's not authorized, request it with diagnostic.requestLocationAuthorization().\n\n\nThank you for helping me i know it is very fraustrating for you that you have to explain each and everything.\n\nIt's OK, this is a complicated mechanism to implement and lots of devs find it tricky to understand. Sorry if I sounded rude.. ",

    "janpio": "Did it work? Can this be closed?. You will probably have more luck asking this question on the Ionic Forum: https://forum.ionicframework.com/. There is now a forum thread where we try to tackle this problem: https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/issue-inappbrowser-invalid-event-target/88548. As @ihadeed said this has been solved. Unfortunately there hasn't been a release since 21 days, so the change is not available via npm yet.. I am not 100% sure about the <style> block, any better way to fix the styling of the ol li?\nNext steps and possible future PRs include improvements on all the plugins' descriptions that are now more highlighted or improvements on the \"Add Plugins to Your App's Module\" paragraph of the Overview that will now get more readers. The whitespace of headlines could also be minimized, I am currently investigating if this is needed anywhere else.. Thanks. Removed them, so I think we are good to go.. Good point, I added this. I started this PR before CLI3 came out, so my thought back then was to wait. But now it makes sense to just include it. (Note: There are probably lots of descriptions etc that contain the cold command). @perrygovier Do you need anything else changed here or can this be merged now?. Hmmm:\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-site/blob/master/content/docs/native/camera/index.md looks good, but https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/onesignal/ is some other version that is missing the \"Installation\" bit and also has wrong order of repo vs. description.. D'oh me. Sorry.. (I think you should create a second issue for the question so both problems can be handled individually). Is it a specific plugin that makes everything slower or is every one adding a bit that just sums up to \"a lot\" in total?. @savanvadalia Ionic Native only helps to implement existing Cordova plugins in Ionic applications. So Ionic Native would require a Wifi Cordova plugin that already has all the functionality, and then would make sure it is nice and easy to be used inside Ionic apps. Do you know a Cordova plugin that has all the required functionality?. This is quite the opposite: No apps can use these APIs, not even native ones.. The YouTube video you linked to is doing it manually, isn't it?\nhttps://youtu.be/hYMGHIv5eIY?t=66\nAnd yes, there is no reason why this plugin shouldn't be added to Ionic Native.. @tryadelion Ionic Native can only implement Cordova plugins that are there - and it seems there is no widely used and supported Cordova spinner plugin that supports all platforms, correct? Which one would you suggest to be implemented?. Maybe the API of this plugin is similar enough to be used with the same Ionic Native wrapper:\nhttps://github.com/greybax/cordova-plugin-native-spinner is a fork of https://github.com/ravi013/cordova-plugin-spinnerdialog which is based on https://github.com/Paldom/SpinnerDialog which has an Ionic Native wrapper at https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/spinner-dialog/\n(What a mess...). @greybax Great that you jump in here! Ahh, now I se, you are 4 levels down from Paldom/SpinnerDialog. Can we somehow compare your repo to the great-great-grandmother Paldom/SpinnerDialog in Github UI? If there is nothing incompatible, I think it should be fine to maybe change the Ionic Native plugin to your repo.. Well, somebody make a PR for the plugin, add that link into the description and the people responsible will look into it!. By using that \"solution\" you are working around Ionic Native, you could just use the Cordova plugin directly then. This should probably be fixed in Ionic Native.. Plugins don't need to do anything to be \"compatible\" with Ionic Native, it is all on the site of Ionic Native. \nWhy this is breaking here then still has to be investigated though.... Github issues is not the right place for problems and questions. Post at https://forum.ionicframework.com/. https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/src/@ionic-native/plugins/web-intent/index.ts#L32 should probably say window.plugins.intentShim as defined in https://github.com/darryncampbell/darryncampbell-cordova-plugin-intent/blob/master/README.md#intentshim.\nPlease try that locally and report back if it works, then you can just create a PR for that file yourself.. This still mentions IntentShim.onIntent which should be window.plugins.intentShim.onIntent to work.\nI don't know enough about Ionic Native on how to change and fix this locally.\n@ihadeed?. ionic cordova run browser should do the job.. No idea, sorry. Should as it is the exact same command run in the background etc.. Please add the name of the plugin you are referring to in the issue title. Thanks.. Unfortunately this fix wasn't enough I think. I created a new issue at #1860. This sounds more like a support problem, not a real bug in the plugin that is used by dozens of people. Please open a topic at the Ionic Forum: https://forum.ionicframework.com. So no changes at your app at all?. Same as I posted a month ago:\nThis sounds more like a support problem. Please open a topic at the Ionic Forum: http://forum.ionicframework.com. I made the mistake of linking to master instead of to a commit - so I can't check what I was talking about back then. Shame.. Not only that @danielsogl, each plugin links to https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/#Add_Plugins_to_Your_App_Module as step 2 of its installation instructions.\nBut yeah, people still skip that unfortunately :(. How did you build or run the app?. Just a sidenote: v2 in the URL here once referred to version 2 of Ionic, not Ionic Native. Ionic Native documentation has never been archived on ionicframework.com unfortunately.. Ah, didn't look into the history.\n(Somehow this \"I have to look at forks manually to find an actively supported version\" situation is making me uncomfortable.... there has to be a better way.). It is, but I thought maybe saying \"Angular 1\" was a conscious decision here to make sure people find what they are looking for. Some still refer to AngularJS as Angular and maybe get the hint via \"v1\". . That sounds like a great idea.\nMy suggestion was more a runtime debugging thing, an easy way to help people debug things when they don't work. Cordova plugins are just so unreliable (especially those with parameters - or broken package names).. Strange commit history on that one: https://github.com/greybax/cordova-plugin-native-spinner/commits/master. (Please assign this to me, I will take care of it). I'll start collecting topics and posts about this here when I remember it:\nhttps://forum.ionicframework.com/t/admob-work-android-not-work-ios/94824/14. Do these plugins you linked to have the same API as the original one but only add new functionality or fix broken functionality?\nEdit: Investigated a bit myself:\nFrom https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-HTTP:\n\nThis plugin registers a cordovaHTTP global on window\n\nFrom https://github.com/silkimen/cordova-plugin-advanced-http:\n\nThis plugin registers a global object located at cordova.plugin.http.\n\nFrom https://github.com/LlamaloX/cordova-plugin-advanced-http-2:\n\nThis plugin registers a global object located at cordova.plugin.http.\n\nSo these both use a different global object to put there functionality in than the original plugin, so just replacing the repo will definitely not work.\n . If the previous functionality is not changed, I think it would make sense to create a PR for the current plugin to change the repo and plugin object and add the additional methods.. Blog post is out: https://cordova.apache.org/blog/2017/10/18/from-filetransfer-to-xhr2.html. @lehrenberg You misunderstood @stormwin, no need to delete package-lock.json. You only should not change it. Deleting it is as bad as modifying it.\nAwesome first PR though!. Yep, https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/2050/files now only lists your actual code changes.. This is a PR ready to be reviewed, merged and eventually released.. Hey @danielehrhardt, Github shows for this PR that a) this is adding a new wrapper and b) it is conflicting with a file. Could you take a look?. @sgadekar81 Could you please add the name of the plugin you are working on to the PR title?\nAlso, could you explain your changes a bit? Why did you add these? What exactly do they do?. Are you sure this is correct? The interface is actually in plural, ending with an s: https://github.com/saoron/ionic-native/blob/master/src/%40ionic-native/plugins/phonegap-local-notification/index.ts#L24\nTests are also failing because of this:\nsrc/@ionic-native/plugins/phonegap-local-notification/index.ts(13,39): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'LocalNotificationOption'.\nsrc/@ionic-native/plugins/phonegap-local-notification/index.ts(13,39): error TS4063: Parameter 'options' of constructor from exported class has or is using private name 'LocalNotificationOption'.\nI think you should close this PR.. From what I know (and have seen) there is not. Merges happen when they happen, sometimes a lot, sometimes not so much. Seems to be the latter right now.. After someone created a release and published it to npm, which did not happen yet since merging this in: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/releases. \ud83d\udc4d. As an onlooker (and pretty little knowledge of Ionic Native [and no commit rights to this repo!]):\n\nMake sure your PR and issues mention the plugin being worked on. (Most do, but some don't)\nMost PRs are unreviewed. Help the maintainers by checking the code and content of other PRs (of other users) and test the changes locally, comment if you successfully used it in your app.\nAdd links to the code/source of the plugin if you make changes to the Ionic Native wrapper where one can see that you are using/adding/modifying the correct methods/options etc - often one first has to find the actual plugin, read or search the docs, sometimes even the code to find out if the suggested changes actually match the plugin\nIf there is a list of PRs you are sure are good to merge, create an issue where you list them. Mention if code was reviewed, locally tested, if the changes are documented with link to the plugin source - this will make it much easier for a maintainer to go through all of them.\n\nUpdate: To put some money where my mouth is I just went through page 2 of the PRs and commented or reviewed most of them so a maintainer will have it a lot easier to go through those.. Looking at the closed PRs and issues it was ~3 weeks ago that a maintainer did a load of work. My guess is they are currently working on something else (different project, new stuff) and will come back to this repo later. No sign at all that this is actually abandoned or anything.. And page 1 is also reviewed/commented. Let's see what happens.. Does boolean match the functionality of the original plugin?\nhttps://github.com/cordova-plugin-camera-preview/cordova-plugin-camera-preview#taptofocusxpoint-ypoint-successcallback-errorcallback. will this work although the function is not defined in the wrapper?.

    "wwoods": "I actually did see that code, but it's broken, for a number of reasons.\nFirst, with the current code, options.replace is still inverted.  It should be the exact opposite (still) of what it is: exclusive = !options.replace.  \nSecond, I think {append: true}, the old option, is much clearer than {create: false}.  {create: false} is a passive statement saying not to create a file, but it doesn't make clear what should happen instead (append?  replace bytes as they're written?).  On the other hand, if I see File.writeFile(..., {append: true}), I know what's happening (a new file is not being created, instead I'm expecting to append.  If the file didn't exist, I'm creating an empty file and then appending to that).\nThird, and my pull request was guilty of this too (I didn't want to make unnecessary changes but rather fix what was there), I think that WriteOptions should have exclusive instead of replace.\nEvery other file IO library I've seen deals with this the same way: the default mode of operation when writing a file is to create a new file if there wasn't one, or if there was, replace it and overwrite.  Supporting append and exclusive as options makes more sense than create and replace, both of which are the default modes of operation.  Having boolean options whose names are the default behaviors, but are used to turn off those behaviors, is not intuitive.  Generally, optional boolean flags should default to false but can be set to true by the caller - more opt-in behavior, less opt-out.. Is this on iOS?

So i think the problem from there. But don't know why. Then i test the FileReader outside the plugin. I just read my blob file with FileReader, but it not callback to the onload like cordova-plugin-file.

And since it just uses window.localStorage on the browser, shouldn't it just work as expected when running ionic serve ?\u001c. @ihadeed what about this, should I open an issue re:\n\n@mebibou Ok I found the problem here.\nSee https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/plugin.ts#L112\nWe check if the pluginRef exists before trying to call a function. Because in some cases, plugins have Web APIs ( I think only Geolocation does ... ). In this case, window.screen is the pluginRef for the ScreenOrientation plugin. The plugin adds properties to that global variables instead of creating it's own variable. So, Ionic Native thinks that the plugin has a Web API and attempts to call the function.\nI think a good solution here would be to wrap the get() function in Ionic Native with a try/catch block to catch these kind of errors.. @tscislo platform browser and ionic serve are two different things. Nevermind, Sim plugin already gets the phone number. @ihadeed I think it's referring to this comment: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/src/plugins/push.ts#L47\n\nIf you use the NotificationEventAdditionalData interface as it is, there is no way to pass custom data, and in this case to pass in the actions. That's the use case we can see on the push plugin documentation https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/blob/master/docs/PAYLOAD.md#in-line-replies. @rebearteta remove the that thingy, using arrow function does that when compiled to js:\n(<any>Window).voteUpAction = (data) => {\n  let idea = data.additionalData.payload;\n  this.nav.push(ItemDetailsPage, { item: idea });\n};. Maybe you should import { CaptureImageOptions, MediaCapture } from 'ionic-native';?. @ihadeed updated the description. @ihadeed yes you told me to open an issue for it here. Maybe you should still put the code when the platform is ready, just in case:\n```typescript\nexport class Page1 {\n  title = \"old\";\nconstructor(public navCtrl: NavController, platform: Platform) {\n    platform.ready().then(() => {\n      NFC.addNdefListener(() => {\n        this.title = \"new\";\n      }, () => {});\n  NFC.addMimeTypeListener(() => {\n    this.title = \"new\";\n  }, () => {});\n});\n\n}\n}\n``. hum the documentation should be updated andonSuccess, onFailureshould be removed from the functions definitions. Which version of the plugin are you using?. The reference on the plugin points to https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-printer, which redirects to another one which has different definitions than the one in the @ionic-native. Could you try usingprint? I'm guessing it would be the only one that would work. The definition needs to be updated. On which platform are you trying this?. @ihadeed thanks, I've added the events. Shouldn't this bepluginRef: 'headerColor',?. Aren't you missinghideNavigationBardefinition?. I believe it should benavigationbarinstead. What would be the difference?. ah yes correct, will do. by the way, I should probably add theremoveEventListenerdefinition, but to work it needs the function passed in the observable or theaddEventListener` function, which seems a bit strange, doesn't it?.

It was fixed when I went back to app-scripts@0.0.41.\nAnother thing that I noticed is that, I was getting the same error when I was occasionally calling NativeStorage before this.platform.ready() was fired.

I'm not sure but updating ionic-cli might solve your issue. Just run npm install ionic@2.1.15 -g (you might need to sudo this).\nAlso, take a look at this thread. It seems to be known issue with app-scripts.\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts/issues/467\nMy understanding so far is that this issue is not related to ionic-native.\nPlease let us know of the outcome.\nUpdate:\nAlso, try updating to the nightly version of app-scripts:\nionic/app-scripts@nightly\nThere has been some changes that are not released yet.. @tscislo runionic cordova platform ls and you will see a list of cordova platforms that you can use including android and ios. You will see browser listed there as well.\nSo similar to iOS and Android, you can run ionic cordova run browser.\nThis will start a page/tab in your browser just like ionic serve. The main difference is that now you are running the app in the cordova environment just like a device.. @tscislo Yes that is right. When you runionic serve, you are not in a cordova environment so the ionic-native packages (which are actually cordova plugins) are not available. But when you run ionic cordova run browser the plugins should be available.\nAs far as the storage stuff is concerned, what you are looking for may be ionic storage:\nhttp://ionicframework.com/docs/storage/\nIf you do not want to use SQLite and prefer to use NativeStorage instead, you will have to implement that manually..

Unfortunately SecureStorage does not provide it. It simply resolves its promise with an error.. @Maziar-Fotouhi thanks! That makes a lot of sense. However still I'm wondering why other @ionic-native services while running using ionic serve do not throw errors they just throw warnings that things are not supported, which is fine.

Read docs from here http://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com/docs/v2/native/nfc/\naddMimeTypeListener have first parameter mimeType, it's required\nAll functions return Observable, so you should subscribe to.\nSo try something like this:\n```\nexport class Page1 {\n  title = \"old\";\nconstructor(public navCtrl: NavController, platform: Platform) {\n    platform.ready().then(() => {\n      NFC.addNdefListener().subscribe(() => {\n               // your code here\n      });\n      NFC.addMimeTypeListener(<-- mimeType here -->).subscribe(() => {\n        // your code here\n      });\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\nread about mimeType here: \nhttps://github.com/chariotsolutions/phonegap-nfc#nfcaddmimetypelistener. i will take a look. there is other link for that\nhttp://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com/docs/v2/native/. This plugin have a problem. It cannot detect whether gps or location service options are disabled. So, first of all, check if 'Access to my location' option is enabled in your phone. Then activate GPS option, and finally try with your app. https://github.com/blakgeek/cordova-plugin-firebase-database. I created my own plugin where i merged current firebase plugin and database plugin in one. Then i created my own ionic-native plugin for that..\nI can tell you that database plugin (https://github.com/blakgeek/cordova-plugin-firebase-database) works OK. There is one bug with some filters i think in js scripts. Plain SDK approach is the best. But you can anytime reuse code from firebase-ui-auth or any other firebase projects like messaging, crashreport, realtime-database if you need some examples or instructions.\nI am also looking for good firebase-auth plugin. I found one (https://github.com/blakgeek/cordova-plugin-firebase-auth-google) but it is not working. and all in one\nhttps://github.com/jsayol/cordova-plugin-firebase-sdk. @Zerokk \nit is known that some Xiaomi devices with specific ROMs (EU MIUI ROM i think) have a problem with geolocation service. It's software problem. You can find some discussions here (https://xiaomi.eu/community/)\nI tested my app on multiple Xiaomi devices (Redmi 3, Redmi Note 3 PRO, Mi5sPlus), all with MIUI 8 on global ROM and geolocation service works without problems. Last time i tried this without this patch, it gave me very strange results both when i have and do not have a value for namespace...\nLook at the code in plugin... it says if you do not provide namespace then error = success, success = namespace and that is index 1 and 2 and not 2 and 3 anymore\nexports.setDefaults = function (defaults, namespace, success, error) {\n    var args = [defaults];\n    if (typeof namespace === 'string') {\n        args.push(namespace);\n    } else {\n        error = success;\n        success = namespace;\n    }\n    exec(success, error, \"FirebasePlugin\", \"setDefaults\", args);\n};\nI remember that in that case i got success response in error callback.\nP.S: i already use this patch in apps that is in production, and they are working perfectly. @wf9a5m75 can you check this and confirm that extending from IonicNativePlugin class instead of BaseClass can cause this problem?. https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/blob/master/www/HtmlInfoWindow.js#L232\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/src/%40ionic-native/plugins/google-maps/index.ts#L1956.

    "sryze": "@ihadeed  This needs to be stated somewhere in documentation for ionic native. Docs claim that it works the same way with ionic v1 as ngCordova but with ngCordova you don't need to call subscribe.. OK, it wasn't documentation, sorry. I think I got that impression from this blog post: http://blog.ionic.io/ionic-native-native-powers-for-your-app/\n\nFor those in the community that have used our similar project for Angular 1, ngCordova, it\u2019s now time to say good bye to that project. As of Ionic Native 1.3.0, Angular 1 is now supported out of the box, with practically identical service and API names as ngCordova. Plugin support is now on par or better than ngCordova, and we\u2019re baking Ionic Native by default into all new Ionic 2 projects, so usage should be much higher than with ngCordova. Additionally, ngCordova was bound to Angular 1, and Ionic Native is framework agnostic.\nTo start using Ionic Native in Ionic 1 projects, include the bundle file in the latest release, and change your import from ngCordova to ionic.native. Many calls should Just Work, but take a look at the docs to see what needs to be changed. You\u2019ll need to prefix each Class name with $cordova before injecting and calling it. For example: $cordovaCamera.. I thought deprecated means \"it works but will be removed soon\". The message is misleading..

Please have a look at last few comments on this discussion on Ionic forum.\nhttps://forum.ionicframework.com/t/handling-push-notification-action-buttons-with-phonegap-plugin-push/44161/12. @ihadeed yes I know for actions we need to send additional data in the payload when sending notification from server, but I am referring to the click handlers for those action buttons.. @ihadeed can you please reopen and review it again, its seem its still not properly supported. It would be really great if we could register the callback function through push object. For example\n    this.push.on('onReply', (data) => {\n        this.nav.push(ReplyMessageComponent, { id: data['additionalData']['id'] });\n    });. What about this:\n\n{ \"icon\": \"emailGuests\", \"title\": \"EMAIL GUESTS\", \"callback\": \"emailGuests\", \"foreground\": true},\nOn clicking EMAIL GUEST button I want to take user to the EmailGuestPage\nthis.nav.push(\"EmailGuestPage\", { id: data['additionalData']['id']});\nBut if I add it to the callback like this\nwindow.emailGuests= function (data) {\n            this.nav.push(\"emailGuests\", { id: data['additionalData']['id'] });\n        };\nClicking EMAIL GUESTS button on notification throws error \"Cannot read property 'push' of undefined\" Probably this.nav.push is undefined..

I have given DB name as 'test'. But where do I find this DB (physical path)? location is 'default', shouldn't db be in 'www' folder? I couldn't find it there. Anybody knows where does ionic create this DB? Can't I give a specific location like src/app/DBs/mydb.sqlite ?. This is what I did and got it working (which solved our purpose):\n1. Installed 'File' (to use path in mobile to store a file) and 'Transfer'(to download a remote zip(sqlite) file) cordova plugins.\n2. Unzip the file by installing 'Zip' plugin.\n3.

I actually did not use sqlite-ext plugin, I have used sqlite-storage.\nThese are the plugins that I used which are mentioned in ionic 2 doc (https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/sqlite/):\n'File' = ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-file\n'Transfer' = ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-file-transfer\n'Zip' = ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-zip\n'SQLite' = ionic plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage\nI think your query isn't working as sqlite storage and sqlite-ext are different plugins. Try sqlite storage and see how it goes. \nCheers!\n. @cocowalla While opening the db, following code is used. If it's ios, 'iosDatabaseLocation' would be used as default, while for android, 'location' would be used as default. In both the cases, DB would point to the same location where it was downloaded and unzipped.\n`\n  if(this.platform.is('ios')){\n        dbObj = {name: \"appdata.db\", iosDatabaseLocation: 'default'};\n\n    }else if(this.platform.is('android')){\n        dbObj = {name: \"appdata.db\", location: 'default'};\n    }\n\n`. @arunpapena \nAs mentioned by @cocowalla  above, have you tried this?\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/issues/881#issuecomment-290431854.

Is applicationStorageDirectory + '/library/localdatabase/' the correct path for both Android and iOS?\nI'm working in an emulator right now - do you know if this should work in the Android emulator? When I try it, it always seems to create a new, empty database, rather than using the one that was downloaded.. @megharajdeepak I figured it out, the path does differ for Android, so you need something like:\nthis.platform.is('ios')\n    ? \"/library/localdatabase/\"\n    : \"/databases/\"\nThanks for the sample you gave, it was really helpful for downloading and using pre-populated SQLite databses \ud83d\udc4d . @iursevla cordova-sqlite-storage. @iursevla \nYes, cordova-sqlite-storage is working with pre-populated databases.\nThe openDatabase method has been renamed to create, which despite the misleading name only actually creates a new database if the specified file doesn't already exist.. > Woah as the primary author and maintainer I find that statement confusing! The cordova-sqlite-storage version does NOT implicitly support pre-populated databases (using the createFromLocation option).\n@brodybits I find that statement confusing! :)  I'm using this method successfully, and it sounds like @megharajdeepak is too.\nHere's what I'm doing:\n\nDecide where to download the database to (note this.file is a File object from cordova-plugin-file:\n\n```\n// Storage path differs on iOS and Android\nlet pathPart = this.platform.is(\"ios\")\n    ? \"library/localdatabase/\"\n    : \"databases/\";\nreturn this.file.applicationStorageDirectory + pathPart;\n```\n\n\nDownload the database from a remote endpoint\n\n\nOpen the database (note this.db is an SQLite object from your (rather good) cordova-sqlite-storage plugin:\n\n\n```\nlet dbConfig: SQLiteDatabaseConfig = this.platform.is(\"ios\")\n    ? { name: \"my_database.db\", iosDatabaseLocation: \"default\" }\n    : { name: \"my_database.db\", location: \"default\" };\nthis.session = await this.db.create(dbConfig);\n```\nAnd it works great, exactly as expected.\nA couple of points:\n\nThe reason for downloading populated databases (rather than downloading the data and inserting it into a new database created by the client), is that the databases I'm working with are rather large. It's far more efficient for my use case to download a ready-made database\nIs there some reason you would expect this not to work?\nBit of a tangent, but both openDatabase and create don't quite describe what is happening - how about openOrCreate?

As discussed in https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-help/issues/26 I will update the sqlite plugin documentation to reflect this capability.\n\n\nBit of a tangent, but both openDatabase and create don't quite describe what is happening - how about openOrCreate?

Fair enough. I didn't notice there is an open PR, my apologies.\nIs there an ETA for a merge & release?\n. Was merged in v3. Idiotic. missed the shake plugin. somehow, it fixed itself :). I am right - so is this expected to be catched, or I am right that you are catching most errors from most plugins?. So, letting you know:\nError: Uncaught (in promise): cordova_not_available\nWhen using native audio plugin on serve. Perhaps it is the way I am doing it..\nVersion:3.4.3\n\nI am using it outside of angular context, so I import the injector, and then:\nconst nativeAudio = injector.get(NativeAudio);\nnativeAudio.preloadSimple(\"ding\", \"assets/sounds/ding.mp3\").then(() => {\n    nativeAudio.setVolumeForComplexAsset(\"ding\", 0.3);\n});\n*The injector is the angular injector. @ihadeed Repro:\nhttps://github.com/AmitMY/ionic-native-audio-error\nHow:\n- ionic start a menu app\n- add @ionic-native/native-audio to package, module, and app\n- inject the injector\n- when platform ready, inject NativeAudio and load something\n. Here is an example of issues with the current mocking system: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/1350\nJust making it more clear that this kind of system (native/browser) should be implemented.. @ihadeed Well, I think you are on the right track.\nWhat do you think of conditional providers based on cordova being present or not?\nIf not, perhaps check the user's platform (desktop / mobile is what matters) and conditionally inject by that?\n```\nlet providers = [];\nif(window.cordova)\n  providers.push(Toast);\nelse\n  providers.push({ provide: Toast, useClass: ToastMock });\n@NgModule({\n  providers\n})\n```\nAnd of course, make both providers use the same interface.. @ihadeed Hmm ok, sounds completely fair.\nSo in general the idea is to supply mocks to all native plugins (via this repo), and then the dev can test in browser, and create whatever condition they want.\nAnd of course, mocks need to follow the same interface...\nAre we on the same page or am I off?. @ihadeed Yep, same idea, only for angular and ionic 3 (not angularjs and ionic 1). No, this one is solved.. forgot to close it\nFoolish me ran it in serve, not in browser platform. @jellebrouwer Correct.\nFor serve support for routing, use the segment on IonicPage.\nhttps://ionicframework.com/docs/api/navigation/IonicPage/\nIt does not function the same, but close enough. Thanks @ihadeed , I did not notice it.\nHowever, that undefined check you linked to worries me.. undefined is not triple equal to an undefined string (undefined !== 'undefined')\n\nSo I am guessing that check is not good enough.\nAlso, cordova_not_available and plugin_not_installed both are not correct responses for this situation. if the plugin has an instance, but does not have a method, it should say something like method_not_available and print an error for the correct plugin (in console).\nDo you agree?\n. @ihadeed I managed to figure out that the plugin is the Rollbar native plugin.\nThis check is mandatory... @ihadeed Done.\nThe error message will be wrong though.. It will say plugin_not_installed instead of method_not_available, and will not supply any info on what method is undefined. @ihadeed Thanks a lot!\nI guess that was the issue with the rollbar plugin.\nIts funny, I have rollbar.js also, which means I have around 200 errors, 20 unique, giving me an error, because rollbar native has a wrong reference :P\nI find it hilarious.. Any chance for a new release? this is quite a major fix (for my code at least). @ihadeed Thanks!. @ihadeed Are plugins being loaded for serve?\nI though plugin only work in a platform, not in serve, however, it shows me this list:\n\nThis is my source:\nplatform.ready().then(() =>\n    this.plugins.forEach(plugin =>\n        this.loadedPlugins.push({plugin, isInstalled: (<any>plugin).installed()})\n    ));. Update - issue happens on browser platform as well, and also deeplink is firing twice. It does work on device, not on simulator.. Reproduction repository:\nhttps://github.com/AmitMY/ionic-media-record-repro. Find out why!\nI used typescript: ~2.5.0 instead of ~2.3.4\nI'm leaving this open because this has to be fixed when ionic uses angular 5. Thanks.\nApparently, all my plugins were v5, except for the camera. (Obviously, installing rxjs-compat solves it but it shouldn't be required imo). Thanks. Didn't see that release in GitHub.

This is totally not the expected behaviour even if the underlying plugin causes this.. Yes, looks good!. I can confirm this issue as well.. Yeah, figured out. Docs should be updated right?. Thanks. You don't need to use the file-transfer plugin anymore, you can use browser API to achieve the same result. Check the deprecation notice for details. (One drawback is the ios10 min requirement).

    "waynebloss": "It's on my device, an iPhone 6s.. I don't think this is an issue with Ionic Native anymore because I'm now having the same issue when calling navigator.camera.getPicture directly.\nIf I don't pass any options, everything works fine. If, however, I pass the following options then the success path never returns. (Canceling the camera after it pops up causes the failure path to return in every case.)\njs\n  var options = {\n    // Size\n    quality: 80,\n    targetWidth: 1024,\n    targetHeight: 768,\n    // Actions\n    allowEdit: false,\n    correctOrientation: false,\n    saveToPhotoAlbum: false,\n    // iOS\n    popoverOptions: CameraPopoverOptions,\n    // Basic\n    encodingType: Camera.EncodingType.JPEG,\n    sourceType: Camera.PictureSourceType.CAMERA,\n    destinationType: Camera.DestinationType.NATIVE_URI\n  };\nSo, I need to narrow it down the exact option that is causing this.. It turns out, the problem happens whenever I use destinationType: Camera.DestinationType.NATIVE_URI regardless of whether saveToPhotoAlbum is true or false.\nAn iOS quirk regarding these options is mentioned in the docs, but in that case I'd expect an exception instead.. This is a duplicate of #975 . @almothafar In code that was working before the upgrade, \"I get an empty object error when I call $cordovaFile.readAsText. Also, $cordovaGeolocation.getCurrentPosition never returns.\" is what I mean.\nHere is my code to call $cordovaFile.readAsText:\njs\nfunction readTextFile(fileName) {\n  console.log('Reading text file ' + fileName);\n  return $cordovaFile\n    .readAsText(directory.base, fileName)\n    .catch(failedReadFile(fileName));\n}\nHere is my code to call $cordovaGeolocation.getCurrentPosition:\njs\nfunction getPosition() {\n  var options = {\n    enableHighAccuracy: true,\n    maximumAge: 60000,\n    timeout: 0\n  };\n  return $cordovaGeolocation.getCurrentPosition(options);\n}\nIt's pretty straightforward code and I don't think I'm calling anything incorrectly, but I could be wrong.. Thank you @almothafar . As I mentioned - .readAsText returns an empty object to my promise catch handler. There is no need to see any other code for that one.\nAlso, .getCurrentPosition returns a Promise, not an observable. This is evidenced by the code, the documentation and an example in the code for v2.9.0. When I call that function, it never returns to my then or catch handler. If I revert back to v2.2.16 (which I have done), the call to .getCurrentPosition works as expected.\nI am following the documentation of ionic-native as you can see from my link above.\nMy app is already using ionic-native v2.2.16 and everything works fine. When I looked for a list of breaking changes between v2.2.16 and v2.9.0 I don't see any. Can you point to one documented breaking change between those versions? If none are documented that is a problem.. ",

The CordovaProperty decorator is attempting to access target.pluginRef, which is not yet defined. It is the Plugin decorator which defines this property, but this is executed only after the CordovaProperty decorator, which in turn is executed only after the class in which the property is defined is called.\nI believe the solution is to move the calls to getPlugin back to where they were before; this will mean the CordovaProperty decorator will be executed before the getPlugin calls, and thus target.pluginRef will at that point be defined..

I can share more detailed results if requested. \nMy conclusion: WebView is not the issue, no problems with native SDK or airplane mode. Geolocation works fine in stand-alone Cordova, and it also works when using a specialized Cordova GPS plugin. \nNote: Using airplane mode does not disable Geolocation except when using a non-cellular enabled, WiFi-only tablets. Using airplane mode will actually force Geolocation to use GPS on all cellular-enabled devices.\nCross-reference: https://github.com/andygup/ionic2-esri-map/issues/8. @ihadeed Thanks for clarifying and providing the sample, yes the Ionic Geolocation plugin pattern in that repo does work for me. \nVerified on Ionic 3.18.0/Cordova 7.1.0 compiled with Android 6.3.0 running on an Nexus 6P at Android 8.0.0.\n\nHowever there was another issue we noted. We have customers initializing navigator.geolocation directly inside OnInit. \nProblem: This pattern broke at Angular 5:\n```javascript\nngOnInit(){\n    // This pattern is now broken! :-(\n    navigator.geolocation.watchPosition( . . . );\n}\n\n```\nResolution: We have been able to resolve this lifecycle issue by making sure to use Ionic's platform.ready(). This may also resolve similar issues that other people were seeing. \nHere's a psuedo-example:\n```javascript\n  async  startLocation(){\n    await this.platform.ready();\n    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(result){ . . . }\n  }\nngOnInit(){\n    . . .\n    this.startLocation();\n    . . . \n  }\n```\nSTATUS: Resolved\n.

Every now and then my build gets into broken state and it's very hard to tell who is the culprit and what is the best course of action. The versions of cordova and ios-sim and ios-deploy and IOS/Android versions also add confusion into the mix. It's very hard to lock things down and if things get corrupted it's impossible to revert without a manually backup.\nI think it would be better if ionic even deprecated some of it's CLI Api's since it cases confusion.\nI find the native integrations and build (especially IOS...) to be the hardest part in the my development.

At least before I updated ionic-native, I received the error \"no such method\", as posted in the other issue. After updating ionic-native to 2.8.0 I didn't receive this error anymore, so I assumed the fix is published. But nothing else happens, as well ;-)\nYour workaround is already in use - it's working fine with onConnect and onDisconnect - thank you for that..

You need to do something like the following:\nvar transfer = new $cordovaTransfer();\ntransfer.upload(...);\n\n(instead of the traditional syntax of $cordovaTransfer.upload())\nAnd based on this (https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/issues/86) I am working if Network is one of those instance based plugins? (Incidentally I can find no documentation about which Ionic Native plugins are instance based and so don't use the normal provider syntax reference pattern...)\nSo I haven't had a chance to try it (worked around this by not using the plugin) but I wonder if something along the lines of \nvar network = new $cordovaNetwork()\nor\nvar transfer = new IonicNative.Network();\nthen...\nnetwork.type ....\nmight work?\n. @polfernandez me too.

It seems Chrome and Chromium no longer allow creating files or directories.\nHere is one Stack Overflow report of this problem (but seen with cordova-plugin-file).\nHere is my code that causes the same error message, which is \nSecurityError: It was determined that certain files are unsafe for access within a Web application, or that too many calls are being made on file resources.\n\nThis error gets reported in the catch() block of this code:\nwindow.addEventListener('filePluginIsReady', function() {\n    file.createDir(file.dataDirectory, 'woohoo', true).then(\n        _ => console.log('We did it!!!')\n    ).catch(err => console.log(err));\n}, false);\n\nwhich I put at the beginning of app.component.ts.\nVersions, from package.json:\n\"@ionic-native/core\": \"3.13.1\",\n\"@ionic-native/file\": \"^4.1.0\",\n\"ionic-angular\": \"3.6.0\",\n\nNote 1: The browser did ask, with the typical alert, whether the app can get access to files stored locally on the device and of course I answered 'Yes' to give the app permissions. This security error seems to always show up.\nNote 2: This all happened after starting chrome with the '--allow-file-access-from-files' flag from the command line\nNote 3: The same problem shows up in Chromium\n. Could you please elaborate with code?  If not, could you please mention what worked for you?  Did you use the HTML5 File API?  Did you ever create a file or a directory successfully via JS in the browser? Did it work in the mobile version of the browser as well?  Thanks!. ",
    "DennisSmolek": "Thanks, glad it's not just me. \nI was able to use vanilla JS to save to the localFS for testing purposes so I'm pretty sure the issue is in however cordova/ionic is doing it... So, if you look at cordova-file-plugin you can see it says it is based on the Filesystem API spec that only chrome supports. So I just use the basic stuff here\nOn using the file system. When I request on my own I'm able to resolve a file system, and when I tear into the file-plugin I can see it using similar code. If I do a plain cordova example (non ionic) that uses the file-plugin I'm able to get it to work.. No specific examples at the moment, I might make a pen if it becomes more of a pain. IF you log out both options what is the path it provides? mine outputs differently... @iamkarlson I meant if you do console.log('external:', corodova.file.externalDataDirectory); console.log('dataDirectory:' cordova.file.dataDirectory)'\nI don't have the path in front of me right this second but we've been fighting some fileTransfer issues and it doesn't seem the same. . Ok I resolved this but leaving it open as I think there should be a note somewhere in the docs as this took 4 days of work to figure out WTF is going on.. \nFileTransfer is built on the BackgroundDownloader which is a cool class but has a few quirks, especially in debug/dev situations. \nFor whatever reason it is fairly common to knock the download queue out of sync and the backgroundDownloader will start to act all wonky. \nIt doesn't respond to ANY requests and doesn't throw errors. So you make a call to get all active downloads and nothing happens. You start a new download which says it worked, but you get no error or success for the file itself. You get stuck.. \nThe very bottom of this guide has the solution: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh700370\n\nWhen using Background Transfer during development, you may get into a situation where the internal caches of active and completed transfer operations can get out of sync. This may result in the inability to start new transfer operations or interact with existing operations and BackgroundTransferGroup objects. In some cases, attempting to interact with existing operations may trigger a crash. \nTo work around this issue, completely uninstall all versions of the app and re-deploy with the new language, architecture, culture, or capability. This can be done via the Start screen or using PowerShell and the Remove-AppxPackage cmdlet.\n\nSo, right click the app from the start bar, uninstall it, then relaunch the debugger. Boom, works like it should.... ",

Make sure the version number of @ionic-native/google-maps plugin you reinstalled is really 4.3.2.\nCheck the package.json file in the node_modules folder.\nEven if you can not solve the problem by yourself, please share your project files (not only your code) on github. I will check it.. I just built and run your project files, and works perfectly.\n(Since you don't specify the draggable: true, the marker is not able to drag)\nhttps://github.com/tsn731/ionic-native-maps/blob/e7736a0ae604e3c0451f4387540552f265ca58ac/src/pages/home/home.ts#L56-L61\n\n. I confirmed the APK file I built from your project files run on my Android 4.4.4 and Android 8.0.. The bindTo() method synchronizes the value between objectA and objectB.\nSorry I forgot to write this method explain at the document repo.\nhttps://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemapsdoc/blob/master/v2.0.0/class/BaseClass/bindTo/README.md. Actually that are static methods.\nThe class name of original version is all lower case plugin.google.maps.geometry.spherical, but ci/circleci did not accept lower case, so I changed to Spherical\njs\nvar radius = plugin.google.maps.geometry.spherical.computeDistanceBetween(center, newValue);\nhttps://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps-doc/tree/master/v2.0.0/class/utilities/geometry/spherical\nhttps://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps-doc/tree/master/v2.0.0/class/utilities/geometry/encoding. Um, the pluginRef is needed in the original plugin code, or the ionic wrapper code?\nI'm not familiar with ionic at all (as you may know).. Oh, I see. Thank you for the fixing.. Let me try one more thing.. I have a question.\njs\n  @InstanceCheck()\n  addMarker(options: MarkerOptions): Promise<Marker | any> {\n    return new Promise<Marker>((resolve, reject) => {\n      this._objectInstance.addMarker(options, (marker: any) => {\n        if (marker) {\n          resolve(new Marker(this, marker));   <--- Does the keyword `this` indicate the wrapper plugin itself at this line?\n        } else {\n          reject();\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  }\nThe reason of this is the getMap() methods return the instance of original plugin, but I guess the most ionic developers except the instance of the wrapper plugin.. The getMap() method is designed for OOP.\nFor instance, you can do like this:\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function() {\nvar map = plugin.google.maps.Map.getMap(mapDiv);\nmap.on(plugin.google.maps.event.MAP_READY, function() {\n     map.addMarker({\n        ...\n     }, onMarkerAdded);\n  });\n});\nfunction onMarkerAdded() {\n   var marker = this;\n   var map = marker.getMap();\n}\n```\nAs you can see, in the above code, I don't need to create a global instance for the map.. @ihadeed I did. If you have no problem, please merge this pull request. Thanks.. Since some people already affected by the current native wrapper plugin.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45137375/ionic-2-use-htmlinfowindow-in-native-cordova-plugin-googlemaps/45149922#45149922\nhttps://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/issues/1567\nhttps://forum.ionicframework.com/t/ionic-use-htmlinfowindow-in-native-cordova-plugin-googlemaps/98440\nI hope you accept this pull request soon.. @ihadeed Could you accept this pull request at once?\nMany people affect by the current wrapper plugin... :(. Thank you!. Thank you so much. Thank you for the update. And could you tell me when this document page is updated?\nhttps://ionicframework.com/docs/native/google-maps/. I see.\nSince the document of the production site has many wrong points, (such as no isAvailable method),I appreciate if the page is updated at once.\nThank you for considering.. https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/1834. @ihadeed Could you update the plugin?\nAnd how to install the @ionic-native/googlemaps plugin from local.\nSince I can not install the plugin from local, I can not test the code.. Ok, thank you. I will try it tomorrow. I tried npm run build google-maps , and it worked!\n(I could not wait tomorrow)\nI will test all methods in couple of days, so could you wait for a while?\n\nBy the way, I also tried npm link, but it caused @ionic-native/core module is not found, even it was installed. I just let you know.. I tested couple of methods, and I noticed there are some incorrect code. I will test all methods one by one. Please wait for a while. I will let you know when I check all methods.. By the way, the plugin contributers and I are creating a demo app that demonstrate all features with example code.\nYou can use this demo app for test when you need to update the wrapper plugin.\nhttps://github.com/wf9a5m75/ionic-googlemaps-demo. >I also thought about creating a hybrid Google Maps component/module that wraps your plugin and the JavaScript SDK. \nIs this going to be official component, or just playground?\nBecause many people come to the cordova-googlemaps-plugin repository.\nI don't want to receive the issues of not my plugin.. Okay, thank you for clarify. I'm relieved.\nI don't support the browser platform yet.\nBy the way, I think Observable.fromEvent(this._objectInstance, eventName); has a problem.\nIt seems this drops the second argument of callback.\nIn the js plugin, if I do marker.trigger(position, marker), the event listener has to receive both.\nBut the ionic-wrapper version drops the second argument marker.. I found the solution.\nhttps://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/2431#issuecomment-283364650. Yes, I tested so deeply. But this is hard choice.\nBecause the JS plugin already passes two arguments, but ionic accepts only one.\nConverting array/object both create different code from the JS version ... :(. What I wanted thing was:\n```js\nthis.map.addMarker({...}).then(onMarkerAdded);\nthis.map.addMarker({...}).then(onMarkerAdded);\nthis.map.addMarker({...}).then(onMarkerAdded);\nonMarkerAdded(marker) => {\n  marker.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MARKER_CLICK, this.onMarkerClick);\n}\nonMarkerClick(latLng: ILatLng, marker: Marker) {\n  this.map.animateCamera({\n    target: latLng,\n    zoom: 16\n  }).then(() => {\n    marker.showInfoWindow();\n  });\n}\n```\nUsing common event listener saves memory usage.\nBut ionic (typescript?) does not allow this.\nIf I pass the marker instance as the first argument, you can do this.\nBut unfortunately, all marker events passes their position.\nBecause the regular JS can get the marker instance from this.\nSo there was no reason to pass the marker instance to argument, and I also designed events are similar with the Google Maps JavaScript API v3.\nThat's why the plugin passes the marker position.\njs\nonMarkerClick(latLng) {\n  var marker = this;\n  marker.showInfoWindow();\n}\n\nIf this time were one year ago (or half year ago), I change the argument from position to marker instance.\nBut there are already lots of users.\nSo I don't want to change the definition anymore.\nI noticed this today(yesterday), and I spent almost 7 or 8 hours. Then I finally gave up this way.. Yes, I also archived the observable passes the multiple arguments. Almost the same as you did.\nThe problem is Promise.resolve().\nEven if I pass the multiple arguments to the promise.resolve(), it accepts only the first arguments.\n. @ihadeed Sorry, could you tell me how to use the wrap?\nI tried it though, I could not success.. Thank you for your lecture. I archived to pass the multiple values, passed from the JS side, to the event listener.\nBut I wonder one thing.\nSince I prefer pure JS (it means kind of old user?), I prefer to receive these values like this:\njs\nonMarkerClick(latLng: any, marker: any) {\n  marker.showInfoWindow();\n}\nBut it seems I saw this way:\njs\nonMarkerClick(...parameters: any[]) {\n  let latLng = parameters[0];\n  let marker = parameters[1];\n  marker.showInfoWindow();\n}\nCould you tell me which way is natural syntax for ionic users?\n\nThe current wrapper plugin works like this,\n```js\nmarker.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MARKER_CLICK).subscribe(this.onMarkerClick);\nonMarkerClick(latLng) => {\n}\n```\nI think onMarkerClick(latLng: any, marker: any) is better to support backward compatibility.\nBut if this way onMarkerClick(...parameters: any[]) {} is more natural for ionic users, I pass the values for this.. Okay, finally this code works\n```js\nexport class MoveCameraZoomInPage {\n  map: GoogleMap;\nconstructor(public navCtrl: NavController, public navParams: NavParams, private googleMaps: GoogleMaps) {\n  }\nionViewDidLoad() {\n    let self = this;\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      self.loadMap();\n    }, 1000);\n  }\nloadMap() {\n    this.map = this.googleMaps.create('map_canvas');\n    this.map.one(GoogleMapsEvent.MAP_READY).then(() => {\n      let self = this;\n  //self.map.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MAP_DRAG_START).subscribe(self.onMapDragStart);\n  //self.map.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MAP_DRAG).subscribe(self.onMapDrag);\n  //self.map.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MAP_DRAG_END).subscribe(self.onMapDragEnd);\n\n  self.map.addMarker({\n    position: {lat: 0, lng: 0},\n    title: \"hello world\"\n  }).then(self.onMarkerAdd.bind(self));\n\n});\n\nthis.map.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MAP_CLICK).subscribe((latLng) => {\n  let self = this;\n\n  self.map.addMarker({\n    position: latLng,\n    title: latLng.toUrlValue()\n  }).then(self.onMarkerAdd.bind(self));\n\n});\n\n}\nonMapDragStart() {\n    console.log('onMapDragStart');\n  }\n  onMapDrag() {\n    console.log('onMapDrag');\n  }\n  onMapDragEnd() {\n    console.log('onMapDragEnd');\n  }\nonMarkerAdd(marker:Marker) {\n    marker.one(GoogleMapsEvent.MARKER_CLICK).then(this.onMarkerClick);\n  }\n  onMarkerClick(parameters: any[]) {\n    let marker = parameters[1];\nmarker.on(GoogleMapsEvent.INFO_CLICK).subscribe(() => {\n  alert(\"info clicked\");\n});\n\n}\n}\n```\nIn order to archive this, I changed the event names of the wrapper plugin, \nhttps://github.com/wf9a5m75/ionic-native/blob/73a21b1403a821983a87370dbbfb0f3a950a7ee6/src/%40ionic-native/plugins/google-maps/index.ts#L332-L360\nand the JS plugin works with Promise and FakeObservable.\nhttps://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/blob/d128c1f4839ac316fcc1cac17560f6bf010ee66c/www/BaseClass.js. Because on and others methods are not able to convert the instance from JS to the ionic.\nThe JS version did not have the promise and the subscribe  methods.\nThe biggest problem was this.\nIf the JS does not have the FakeObservable, the code becomes like this\n```\nmarker1.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MARKER_CLICK, onMarkerClick);\nmarker2.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MARKER_CLICK, onMarkerClick);\nonMarkerClick(...params: any[]) => {\n  let latLng = params[0];\n  let marker = params[1];\n// This does not work, because marker is instance of JS, not ionic wrapper's one.\n  // marker.one(GoogleMapsEvent.INFO_CLICK).then(() => {\n  //   alert(\"info clicked\");\n  // });\n// This works, but this leads many people confuse a lot.\n  marker.one(GoogleMapsEvent.INFO_CLICK, () => {\n    alert(\"info clicked\");\n  });\n}\n``. https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/pull/1613#issuecomment-321100174. As far as I understand,@Cordovadecorator is for static class, isn't it?\nI think@CordovaInstance` because BaseClass is not static class.\nI think there probably some mistakes in the index.ts, especially property names, constructor parameters.\n. We haven't tested even 1/3 of all methods.\nI appreciate if you join to the working channel on us, and join to the forked repo. Then you can modify, and we can also test it before merging to the ionic-team repo.. Oh, I see.. Thank you for jumping on!\nYou don't need to work on the ionic-googlemaps-demo repo, but you can test it.. @ihadeed Well, we haven't checked all features yet, but at least lots of problems are fixed.\nI really appreciate if you merge the code at once.\nThanks.\n(Asking the problems of the current @ionic-native/googlemaps has been increasing...)\n. @ihadeed Could you update the npm at once?\nI haven't checked all features, but the merge reduces troubles currently reported (user code is correct, but the current plugin is bad).\n. This is already implemented.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/src/%40ionic-native/plugins/google-maps/index.ts#L489. The doc page was updated last week.. I think this is already fixed issue.. This is already fixed.\nhttps://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/issues/1669. The doc page is for pure JavaScript. Not for the ionic wrapper plugin. Because of the restriction of RxJs, the wrapper plugin can not pass multiple arguments to the callback.\nThat's why the wrapper plugin passes multiple values as array to the first argument.\nDid you confirm with console.log()?. Okay, I will check it later.\nAnd might need help @ihadeed . By the way, did you update @ionic-native/core also?. Opps, \\@ is disappeared ...\nI mean did you also update @ ionic-native/core plugin?. Oh, you did (you listed in the description).. I worked with this code.\n\n```TypeScript\nimport {Component} from \"@angular/core\";\nimport {IonicPage, NavController, NavParams} from \"ionic-angular\";\nimport {\n  GoogleMaps,\n  GoogleMap,\n  GoogleMapsEvent,\n  MarkerCluster,\n  LatLng,\n  GoogleMapsAnimation,\n  Marker\n} from \"@ionic-native/google-maps\";\n/\n * Generated class for the AddMarkerClusterPage page.\n \n * See http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#navigation for more info\n * on Ionic pages and navigation.\n /\n@IonicPage()\n@Component({\n  selector: 'page-add-marker-cluster',\n  templateUrl: 'add-marker-cluster.html',\n})\nexport class AddMarkerClusterPage {\n  map: GoogleMap;\nconstructor(public navCtrl: NavController, public navParams: NavParams, private googleMaps: GoogleMaps) {\n  }\nionViewDidLoad() {\n    setTimeout(this.loadMap.bind(this), 1000);\n  }\nloadMap() {\n    let self = this;\nthis.map = this.googleMaps.create('map_canvas', {\n  'camera': {\n    'target': {\n      \"lat\": 21.382314,\n      \"lng\": -157.933097\n    },\n    'zoom': 10\n  }\n});\n\nthis.map.one(GoogleMapsEvent.MAP_READY).then(() => {\n  self.addCluster(self.dummyData());\n});\n\n}\naddCluster(data) {\n    this.map.addMarkerCluster({\n      boundsDraw: false,\n      maxZoomLevel: 12,\n      markers: data,\n      icons: [\n        {\n          min: 3,\n          url: \"./assets/large.png\",\n          anchor: { x: 16, y: 16 },\n          size: {\n            width: 37,\n            height: 37\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }).then((markerCluster: MarkerCluster) => {\n  markerCluster.on(GoogleMapsEvent.MARKER_CLICK).subscribe((params) => {\n    let latLng: LatLng = params[0];\n    let marker: Marker = params[1];\n\n    marker.setAnimation(GoogleMapsAnimation.BOUNCE);\n  });\n\n});\n\n}\ndummyData() {\n    return [\n      {\n        \"position\": {\n          \"lat\": 21.382314,\n          \"lng\": -157.933097\n        },\n        \"name\": \"Starbucks -

I tested your project again.\nWhen I built your project, I got the same error as you.\nHowever, if I reinstall the @ ionic-native/core and @ ionic-native/google-maps, your code work perfectly.\nIt means the package modules you install are old.\nI noticed you specify version 3.12.1 for @ ionic-native/core.

In this case, the native/google-maps wrapper plugin ways to create the map until the element is fully ready.. Try this:\n```\n$> cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-googlemaps\n$> cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-googlemaps@2.2.4 --variable API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID=\"...\"\n```. Try this:\nhttps://github.com/battika/ionic-gmaps-test\n. Is the v5 finally ready to merge?. Got it. Thanks.. We have been waiting for the next updating the @ionic-native/google-maps so far.. The ionic team finally released new version to npm.\nYou need to reinstall @ionic-native/core@4.6.0 and @ionic-native/google-maps@4.6.0. You need to enable myLocation property also.\n{\n  controls: {\n     myLocation: true\n  }\n}\nhttps://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps-doc/blob/master/v2.0.0/ReleaseNotes/v2.2.0/README.md#the-mylocation-property-has-changed\n. Reinstall the cordova-plugin-googlemaps@2.2.8. This is already solved problem.. That's good choice, @mlynch . I can release the new version with the cordova-plugin-googlemaps at the same time. Thus, the users don't need to wait the @ionic-native/google-maps update.. @mlynch Thank you for releasing the new version at least.. Thank you for creating the repo. How about the releasing scheme? Should I still ask the plugin releasing?\nWell, to align the version number of all plugins helps understanding which version is the latest, but this kills the benefit that individual plugin can release their timing.\nIn order to align the version number with other plugins, or review the code to keep the quality as @ionic-native series  I can wait one week. I understand this.\nBut two week, or further, many users get stressful.. If you don't mind the version number that only the @ionic-native/google-maps separate different version number, please add me as collaborators to npm.\nI will release the new version when I am ready.\nIf you mind the version number, or if you want to check the code with the member ionic-native team,  please suggest better scheme.\n. ping. My npm user name is wf9a5m75. Did you try my e-mail address also?. Thanks, @mlynch \nI appreciate for your understanding and help. I will continue the supporting for the ionic-native/google-maps.. Hi, @mlynch \nCould you add CircleCI to https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native-google-maps?. Okay, thanks.. Since the ionic team does not manage the plugin in proper, I take over the management, but the repository is still under the ionic team control. Because the repository owner is ionic team.\nThus, you should not delete the google maps page.\nhttps://ionicframework.com/docs/native/google-maps/. I have an idea.\nUnder this url, there is one page, and link to another url.\nhttps://ionicframework.com/docs/native/google-maps/\nThen on the link, I will create a document site.\nHow about this?. I created documentation. Please link to here.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native-google-maps/blob/master/documents/README.md. ping @mlynch. ping @ihadeed. The issue has been fixed finally. I close this issue thread.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/2490#event-1601723379. Link: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/issues/2410#comment-380119542. Max, the CEO of ionic, says \n\nhttps://forum.ionicframework.com/t/what-about-google-maps/127437/15\nSounds nice. The ionic-native team solves the problem hopefully soon.. The issue has been fixed finally. I close this issue thread.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/pull/2490#event-1601723379. @dopry This is the maintainer of the @ionic-native/google-maps plugin, which is the first plugin moved out from the main repo to the new repo.\n\nI guess there are several reasons.\nFrom maintenance side, separate code on separating repo are kind of stressful.\nIf there are active maintainer on each plugins, there is one of choice.\nBut the ionic-native plugins are created and managed by ionic team mainly.\nThus, management under the one repo is good performance for them.\n\nAnother reason I guess is the mechanism of the official document.\nThe official document (https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/) is generated from the source code automatically. It is simple to generate the document site automatically.\nHowever if the repo is separated, the mechanism becomes more complex.\nThis is the reason there is no GoogleMaps in the document site.\n\nThe reason of the @ionic-native/google-maps moved out from the main repo to new repo are:\n\nThe Google Maps plugin is very complex than other plugins.\nToo much time to approve the pull request.\nI contributed one year before moving out. So I have enough knowledge to maintain the plugin by myself.\nAnd the cordova-plugin-googlemaps is one of the top active plugin.\n\nSo the @ionic-native/google-maps is kind of special case.\nHowever, there is no enough active maintainers for other plugins.\n\nI agree to your idea, but it is kind of difficult in real.\nThus, I think the current style is the best for @ionic-native plugins.. Right, but who will create the test code for all plugins?\nSo why don't you create all test code for all plugins? Then send them as a pull request.\nThat's the start line for considering to separate the repo to each ones, because that might be big benefits for separating.\nOtherwise, no benefits for the ionic team so far (I guess).. New repo of the ionic-native/google-maps is here.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native-google-maps\nNew doc is here.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native-google-maps/blob/master/documents/README.md\n. Sounds great!. Okay. It's fine. Thank you for working.. @dwieeb So, when this url https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/google-maps/ is available?. Great. Thank you for your work.. @mlynch ping. the maintainer of that plugin decided is me.\nThe reason of this is the ionic team does not maintenance the wrapper plugin well.\nIf I sent a new pull request, you left almost 2 months. That's why I got angry, then divided to different repo.\nIf you guarantee to manage well, I don't need to manage the wrapper plugin.\nI don't ask any difficult thing. I just ask please add a link to the google maps repo, like this page.\nhttps://ionicframework.com/docs/native/\nIs this super difficult?. https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/fe5b7ce0afce7aabf7b539890f6699ce8b89a4c6/scripts/docs/processors/jekyll.js#L13-L17. I guess you just modify this script.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/v5/scripts/docs/dgeni/processors/jekyll.js\nShould I send a pull request if difficult work?. @perrygovier Any comments?. Ok, if Ionic team does not help me, I won't help you. Starting from now until you work, I will decline any issues for the ionic-native/google-maps.. Thank you for your replying, I understand that.\nI didn't know the ionic-docs repo. That's why I ignored first two days.\n\nI was hoping I could write a script to inspect it and automatically generate a docs page like the others, but a link would work for now.\n\nCreating a doc page is difficult from different repo, and I think the general doc pages are less information.\nThere are already doc pages, and I will put latest information to here.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native-google-maps/blob/master/documents/README.md\nCould you add a link to this page when you are available?  I just want to ask you only this one.\nThanks.. Okay, effecting a link in next time update is fine. Thanks for your help.. Great! Thank you!. @perrygovier Could you add a link to Google Maps repo URL in the new list? https://ionicframework.com/docs/native. Then when will you (he) add Google Maps link to the list page? I waited 4 days, but no updated.. @ionic-native/google-maps : v5.0.0-beta.21. ionic-native v5?\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/v5/package.json#L53. I feel ionic 4 is almost stable, @capacitor is kind of unstable.\nWell, it's depends on your opinion, you can choose it.\nBut I think ionic team won't work for your request.. Only iOS .... Well, I only manage the google-maps wrapper.\nAccepting your PR is in charge of ionic team.\nI just surprise your plugin supports only iOS because your plugin subtitle is The last Cordova camera plugin you'll ever download.. Could you tell me how different each decorators Cordova, CordovaInstance, CordovaProperty and InstanceProperty?\nWhere should I read the document?. Ah, you are right.. I will change it later.. Did you revert to v5.0.0-beta.14, or you just copy & past by mistake?. ",

    "savanvadalia": "@piotrowski ,\nThank  you for your response. So far with my google search I have found very few Cordova Wifi plugins.\nThe one I have mentioned in my request WifiWizard  is quite popular and it has all functionalities for Android.\nWhen I mentioned about the limitations with plugin for ios, I am not sure if that will be the case for any Cordova Wifi plugin due to Apple not exposing it as Public API (See below Screenshot).\nIf it is Apple enforcing this limitation, I am happy with whatever this plugin provides. In that case I will change my app flow for ios mode and still use this plugin for Android application. \nI hate Apple for the same reasons, it seems they always try to prevent the web to take over native apps!!!\n\n. Oh ok!! thanks for that clarification. I am not sure then how the native apps that I have seen so far does those WiFi functionalities under the hood e.g. (Listing available WiFi access points and connecting to a particular WiFi access point)\nAn example of the functionality I am referring to is in this youtube video\nhttps://youtu.be/hYMGHIv5eIY\nCan we still have the WifiWizard plugin as part of ionic-native ?\n. You are partially correct there, connection is done manually in the 1st part of the video where the phone is connecting to WiFi plug's access-point. In the 2nd part you will see that it scans the home router and connects it by providing the router password from within the App.\nThanks for considering this request to make it as part of ionic-native.\nThis my first request with ionic-native, I am unaware about how these type of requests are prioritized in the development workflow. \nIs it milestone based like ionic-framework or is it based on number of requests for a particular feature?\n.

You can call getIntent() with my plugin to return a JSON representation of the calling intent; there is a 'data' extra in that returned intent which will be nearly the same as getUri() previously returned, https://github.com/darryncampbell/darryncampbell-cordova-plugin-intent/blob/master/src/android/IntentShim.java#L462.

Now my whole project is dead and ionic serve won't work. I'm trying to fix this up and then try to get back into upgrading the depedencies individually, but now, I'm in a dead point. Will update as soon as I get the project fixed.\nNPM should get its shit together with the dependencies management.... @danielsogl Updating the dependencies didn't work. Now my project is properly migrated to the latest version of each peer dependency, and everything works fine, except for the geolocation thingy.\nI tried many things, I'm even monitoring the device and could locate the problem: both cordova navigator geolocation plugin, and ionic-native/Geolocation, fail delivering a response. They just throw error 3 always: timeout, and after some time, they reply with the position. Is taking usually 3-4 mins for that reply.\nAt the moment, it only happens to my Xiaomi mi5s (MIUI 8, Android 6), but it may happen in other devices. Tried everything, even disabling the high precission, but I can't still get a good location, though other apps do it correctly (tried with JustEat and Google Maps). Do you know what may be happening?\nPD: It works perfectly in a Samsung S5 and the browser.\nThank you!\n. @ihadeed I don't get any response from that snippet. It's just as with the normal one: it just gets a lot of time to get a response from the GPS.\n@stormwin I can't find any thread that talks about it; I'm thinking in posting the bug by myself. Do you know if there's a discussion about this topic? They should release an update if it's a ROM problem. Anyways, geolocation works good for you? Don't you know if there can be any workaround to fix this? \nI'm beginning to think that Cordova is not suitable for proper GPS functioning, as many people say... I don't feel any comfortable knowing that my app doesn't work in 1 out of 2 devices I tried this far. . Actually not, it seems to be a widespread problem...\nEl 5 oct. 2017 12:45 p. m., \"Karan Sharma\" notifications@github.com\nescribi\u00f3:\n\nI am facing the same issue with my Redmi Note 4.

It was faster and offered google play services . But its heavy. I needed maps too so I decided to go with it.. @dmastag I am yet to  face any problem .

I'm experiencing exactly the same issue as @blueromans . I'm unsure how to implement the code fix.. Thanks @tobika . I implemented the changes, but am still experiencing the same issue. I ended bypassing ionic native and just using cordova. It seems to be working but one thing I noticed is that the store.ready() method isn't fired until store.refresh() is called, so this could be my underlying issue.. For those of you still having issues, just install the ionic plugin package and don't make the ionic-native package changes as making them is only a temporary fix and will be overwritten every time you rebuild your node_modules. Better off waiting for the fix to be implemented. While your waiting, use the following work around. Only ran basic testing on ios that worked fine. Works perfectly on Android (using in production).

Just call a store.refresh method followed by an updateProducts(). Android should restore purchases itself with the above code.\n. @aabdolla Still using the InAppPurchase2 module, just bypassing the problem ionic native code. You can use any cordova plugin directly, even if ionic doesn't provide it. You just need to implement it differently.\nI provided a full working example. You can use the whole lot, or just take what you need.. @aabdolla You're welcome. Apologies for the typo, I had to strip out most of my code to simplify for the example. RE: Products array: Yes, I just like storing the data in my own object to be accessed the same as the rest of my data.\n. @aabdolla I don't have any IOS apps, so I haven't got any working code I can share. I was playing around with IOS and had it working tho. I believe I just had a button click() event linked to a refresh() method. The button would only be show on IOS (not required on android). All the refresh method contained was store.refresh() from memory.\nYou won't need to do anything anything with store.get() etc, as this should occur at startup/initialization in the above code. \nMaybe double check you have done everything correctly via the cordova documentation\nhttps://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/wiki/HOWTO \n.

Here's an SO post on it.\n. @SellvakumarSS alert() and console.log() can't actually output the contents of the ArrayBuffer; just because the response is {} doesn't necessarily mean its empty.\nIf you specifically need the video in an ArrayBuffer, try creating an invisible <video> tag containing your video file and then grabbing the file/arraybuffer from there.

Adding the code above is breaking my app as soon as I run ionic serve. @chrisgriffith thank you for taking the time to look into this, and I agree with you that this plugin will NOT work in a browser. However, it should not break my app. \nCan try it yourself?\n\nCreate a brand new ionic app\nAdd the plugin and code as described in the official documentation\nRun ionic serve \nThe plugin won't work in the browser, I get that, but the app should run. Do I need to wrap it like this to evaluate for plarform? Maybe?\n\nif (platform.is('cordova')) {\n    ... [secure storage code here]\n}\n.

I do not think any of the plugins run properly in the browser-based testing. The native plugins are meant to access the native apis of the device and so you need the actual device for it to run in most (if not all I think) cases. Once you get the code right, try doing a build and loading it onto your test device. (I could totally be off with that, but it's been my experience).\nSo there are a couple reasons you're running into problems -- you're declaring cordova globally, but it looks like cordova isn't available to you from inside this file using the declare keyword -- that's mainly because this plugin isn't supposed to be accessed like that. To get access to it, and make sure you run the ionic cordova plugin add clipboard command on it so Ionic loads into the package.json, then see if the code below helps.\nin app.module.ts:\nimport { Clipboard } from '@ionic-native/clipboard';\nand add Clipboard to the providers: array\nI ended up using it by importing the plugin into the page controller class I was building in your case that would be ExtratoRevendedorPage\nimport { Clipboard } from '@ionic-native/clipboard';\nthen injecting it into the constructor of the class.\nconstructor( public clipboard: Clipboard, ...){}\nLater I would call it using:\nthis.clipboard.copy('whatever string you want')\nI never used this.clipboard.paste inside my app, but found that the device did copy the content I passed into .copy() into the device clipboard and I could paste into other apps. \nHope you get it working. \n.

They should match.\nNot sure where the difference/discrepancy happened but it did, and the fix is to change the node_modules/@ionic-native/user-agent/index.js of the ionic-native user-agent plugin's pluginRef to \"UserAgent\". (dont forget to remove, re-add the ios/android platform for the change to get picked up)\nAlternatively change the plugin's clobbers target to plugins.useragent, i found the former easier.\nI dont have the time/knowledge to submit a patch to Ionic's repo, but thats the fix you can do locally..

I'm sure it would solve your issue ;-). Ha ha, I knew it.. @tomNjerry, @erperejildo \nSolution:\n\n\nOpen your Project/platforms/ios/Project.xcworkspace. \n\n\nIn xCode, select your project and go to \"Info\" (like on the screenshot).\n\n\nCreate a new row (the little \"+\" on my screenshot, it appears when your mouse is over a row) then enter \"NSCameraUsageDescription\" for the key, and whatever you want for the value. When you're done, repeat this for the key \"NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription\".\n\n\n\nGood to know:\nIf you run your project using xCode directly, you can search the console for \"NS\" and you will quickly find all the privacy descriptions that are missing for your app with the logged errors.\nIf you remove your platform you will have to perform this change again.

But it would be better if someone replied so we can merge it and my fork can go the way of the dodo once more ;-). Hmm, that's not supposed to happen. My fork is essentially the same as the version from @ihadeed , but with the a more recent version of the native player. \nDid you try removing the plugin completely and the re-add it? \nSometimes it even is needed to remove / add your platform again .\nAlso, did you get it to work before? and is this only on IOS?. @sylwester- in this code you do not use my fork ;-)\nin step 2 do this: cordova plugin add https://github.com/Remco75/CordovaYoutubeVideoPlayer\nThen use it with ionic native (see their page)\nhttps://ionicframework.com/docs/native/.

If you find anything new: post back here. @danielsogl Thnx for looking into this. If I can be of any assistance, please let me know. I would be nice to have the dependencies of the plugin managed somehow. Any thoughts on this?. Is any one out there? it seems that the native repository is near dead when it comes to reacting to issues. . well, there's someone out there, but they do not react to issues until they decide to dom something I guess.. (see #2159  ). Tested: this is fixed with #2094 .thnx . I will close this one now. @danielsogl sorry for reaching out this way, but i'm glad I found a member active on this repo. There seems to be almost no activity when it comes to reacting to bugs / PRs / feature requests. I mean, I have issues opened more than 2 months without a reaction from contributors or members (there are reactions from the community)\nCould you tell me if this repo is still maintained? Should we fork it and find a more active userbase? Im sure lost of devvers would like to help out, but this is making it very hard!\nI hope to hear (from anyone ;-)) soon!. @janpio Cool thnx, wherever I can I help out. This is a very broad repo, so only a few now about a subject (the maintainers prob have the most knowledge!)\nProblem is not that the community is not reacting: They do, and they help each other out. \nOnce there is some more reaction from the maintainers I (and others) will be prepared to contribute / get involved even more. But for now it really seems a waste of my time. hehe, I think we will just have to agree to disagree here. I have issues open for months, created a fork for a dependency that many user now use, I have asked in my issues many times if there was a maintainer who would step in. Other issues are confirmed by other users, again with the same result. \nAnd just look at the comments in the issue que: it's pretty hard to even find a contributer reacting / helping out, let alone a member.\nIt is just not maintained. (btw: I really appreciate the effort you put in here!) At least someone is reacting :-) \n. I don't think this can or will be solved by posting an issue here-> If there is a repo for the view-app-> post it there.\nAs this isn't an issue for this repo, I would recommend closing it .

If you already re-created the issue over there, just close one of them.\nThank you for using Ionic. We do not suggest using Cordova's browser platform for anything other than perhaps testing. Our general advice is to use the Web APIs as much as possible, and only use plug-ins when either the webview on the mobile device does not support the action or the action is very mobile specific (integrating with iOS HealthKit, setting the Android status bar color, stuff like that).\nRefer to this site for data on what can be done via Web APIs: https://whatwebcando.today/\nFor PWAs, we suggest not using cordova.js at all.\nIf your app needs to support running as a native mobile app as well as a PWA / web-app, then we suggest detecting how the app is currently running and then using the plugin (if applicable) in mobile and some other appropriate method when on web as per the plugins section of this document: https://ionicframework.com/docs/developer-resources/desktop-support/.

A large component of any open source project is community support, and if you could contribute to that via needed clarifications to the documentation, that would be really great.

Locking this since it is a closed and resolved issue.\n@mas57es - for your issue, that is more of a support request than anything else, which belongs either in our forum or in StackOverflow, etc. and not in the issues list.\nThat said, based solely on the error you are getting, it looks like perhaps you are not following proper version discipline. Please check that the versions of your @ionic-native/* items are consistent, so if you are using @ioninc-native/core version 4.20.0 you are also using 4.20.0 for you other @ionic-native stuff and not a mix if v4.x and v5.x. Looking at the underlying plugin (https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-network-information), there is no downlinkMax property to expose. I don't see anything on the plugin that would provide similar information. It probably ought to be removed here.. Hello! Thank you for opening an issue with us!

It doesn't seem to matter if I wait 10 seconds or 20 seconds.  . A theory from testing for the last 2 hours.\n Just seems like the phone tries to get the location (however that is).  And it fails.  When the app asks for the location,  it doesn't have an answer which fails.  Until something is reset (maybe turning on and off wifi, sometimes turning on and off location).  That only seems to get it to try to look for a location again,  it could fail again.\nThe problem the phone hasn't gotten a location, it doesn't seem to matter what the app does its not going to get a good answer.  . I think the different is cordova is using HTML5 to get the location.  I'm guessing the others don't use that path.   All cordova can do is ask for it, if the webview process is unable to get it from the phone (however that happens) things will fail. \nThe other apps I assume are going straight to the source,  but I also assume that if its not getting a value it can somehow ask or request the data again.   I'm guessing HTML5 can't or doesn't do that, and thus cordova can't.  \nI did find using enableHighAccuracy: true helps more because on the phone I can actually see it requesting the location.  (something shows up in the status bar). . @manish29ify Thanks for this.  I didn't realize Ionic had some of these plugins. \nI had to clear out the android splash screen and images or it would fail to build.  \nIn the app.\nWith Permission does a popup that says: plugin not installed\nWith Navigator  does not have sufficient geolocation permissions. \nWith Navigator permissions nothing comes up. . Switched over to use just the HTML 5 version  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API\nWhich is all the plugin is doing anythings.  I guess it gets straight to the source?  In my case on the samsung S5 it still has the same problem finding location from the wifi.  \nThe location will time out, I turned wifi on and off, it finds the location right away.   Sometimes when I get signal, I'll close the app down all the way.  Get back in and it gets stuck again getting the location.  \nAnother thing I did was download this app\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.zyra.apps.ionicnativeplayground\nThis has a way to call the geoLocation library.    Not surprising I get the same result on the same phone. \nThe only solution I have found is changing  enableHighAccuracy: true  This seems to force it to use the gps chip and not worry about the wifi location.   (I don't know if it tries that first?)\nMy worry is that some phones gps might ended up being slower. . Sorry new theory.  Tested this all again with wifi off.  It should try to get location from the cell data. \nThis would all be with enableHighAccuracy: false. \nTurn phone on\nGo to app\nApp is able to pull location from web right away. \nLeave screen and go back to pull location again,  get a timeout.\nTurn airplane mode on and off. \nGo back to page, able to pull location again.  \nIt seems like that call to geolocation might not be closing down as soon as I think. \nIt feels like when I do the second call, it doesn't work because the first call is still running somehow.\nTurn off the network connections seems to force it to stop.   The same thing happens if I'm on wifi.\nNot sure how to prove this. . ",

    "tobika": "Nice, didn't know there was an PR already. Just to link to the ionic forum discussion.\nhttps://forum.ionicframework.com/t/in-app-purchase-android-ios/103346/9\nIf InAppPurchase2.getPlugin() works it should be at least documented somewhere. Will check also tomorrow.. Looking at the code I guess I found out why ready() doesn't work as a promise.\nUsually you add the @Cordova decorator in front of a function with callback so it's automatically turned into a promised version. @Cordova expects (succesCallback, errorCallback). But the original ready function of the plugin only accepts one callback function that returns a boolean with status true or false.\nSo promisifying the function doesn't work in this way. Any idea how to encapsulate it correctly?\n. @ihadeed thanks for this clarification.\nNonetheless it's a fact that the plugin doesn't work in the current state if you try to use a promise like explained in the documentation. For me everything works great once I change it to a callback style. Even without .getPlugin().\nWhen I try it with a promise I have the same error as @blueromans \nIt's a pitty that people who try to use this plugin but don't know that they can change the typing of the lib won't be able to use it. \nUnfortunately I don't know how to fix the promis problem so maybe for the time being it would be better to accept this PR and change the documentation?. @NodeKing as a workaround open the file node_modules/@ionic-native/in-app-purchase-2/index.d.ts\nand change Line 270 (should be) to:\nready(callback: Function): any;\nThen you can use the this.iap.ready(() => {}) function with a callback \nUpdate:\nHere is even a nicer writeup how to workaround the problem :)\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/issues/1869#issuecomment-332492741. @diegodem did you call this.iap.refresh();\nI think @NodeKing is right when he said that ready is not fired until this.iap.refresh(); is called.. @diegodem I think you should check in the repo of the plugin and create an issue there https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase\n@ihadeed any news on if this PR will get merged or not? If you don't have the time maybe ask someone else or give merge permissions to someone else? or if there is a problem with the PR itself I'm sure we can think of another solution but we need some feedback to do this..

Same behavior as before.\nUpdate: So I wait until the platform is ready, call the configuration to set the handlers and the store ready is still never called with the changes @tobika suggested. Is there something else I am missing?. Oh to me it seemed like you did this.iap.ready after the index.d.ts change or InAppPurchase2.getPlugin().ready.. Well for some reason nothing in here has worked for me. My store.ready never gets called and my handlers for the store just loop forever. I tired using the .getPlugin() and also modified the index.d.ts with the suggestions making it a callback instead of promise.\n@steve-allan If you switch to something that works or find a solution to this, please let me know if you remember :). @NodeKing Thanks for swinging by and providing help! What exactly is it you are doing? You are not using the InAppPurchase2 module? You are using your own store? Sorry for the noobish question.. @NodeKing Ah okay I see. Can my purchase code can still be the same using the store directly?\nasync purchase() {\n    if (!this.platform.is('cordova')) { return };\n\n    let productId;\n\n    if (this.platform.is('ios')) {\n      productId = this.product.appleProductId;\n    } else if (this.platform.is('android')) {\n      productId = this.product.googleProductId;\n    }\n\n    try {\n        console.log(productId);\n        let product = store.get(productId);\n\n        let order = await store.order(productId);\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.log('Error Ordering ' + JSON.stringify(err));\n    }\n}\n\nWith how it is currently I am getting this error:\nError Ordering {\"line\":441,\"column\":28,\"sourceURL\":\"http://localhost:8080/var/containers/Bundle/Application/A66850AB-2460-4B28-BB0A-D46E6752D5A7/MyApp.app/www/plugins/cc.fovea.cordova.purchase/www/store-ios.js\"}. @NodeKing You are amazing! I am on to my next round of issues with purchasing in app purchases but this is no longer a hang up. Thank you so much! That bug above was an easy fix. You had \"products.productId\" and I just had to change it to \"products[productId\".\nWhat is the benefit of updateProducts()? Like keeping our own version of the products array?. @NodeKing Oh okay cool. Yeah, it is working great for me. I just need to put the correct logic now in them. It's all new to me but at least I know the base of the purchasing is going to work.\nSo is there a point to ever switching back to the plugin now that you enabled us to do it ourselves?. My last hiccup now is my restore button. Using this code it looks like it never completes as the console log and alert at the end is never fired and I get this error:\nError Ordering {\"line\":699,\"column\":96,\"sourceURL\":\"http://localhost:8080/var/containers/Bundle/Application/49B5DA21-D504-46C3-90D4-DD550A1ACBFF/MyApp.app/www/build/main.js\"}\nasync restorePurchase() {\n    if (!this.platform.is('cordova')) { return };\n\n    this.restoreClicked = true;\n\n    let productId;\n\n    if (this.platform.is('ios')) {\n        productId = this.product.appleProductId;\n    } else if (this.platform.is('android')) {\n        productId = this.product.googleProductId;\n    }\n\n    console.log('Products: ' + JSON.stringify(store.products));\n\n    console.log('Refreshing Store: ' + productId);\n\n    try {\n        let product = store.get(productId);\n\n        console.log('Product Info: ' + JSON.stringify(product));\n\n        store.refresh();\n\n        console.log(\"refreshed\");\n        this.restoreClicked = false;\n\n        console.log(\"refresh \" + productId + \" owned: \" + store.products[productId].owned);\n\n        alert('Finished Restore');\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.log('Error Ordering ' + JSON.stringify(err));\n\n        this.removeAdsClicked = false;\n        this.restoreClicked = false;\n    }\n}\n\nAny thoughts @NodeKing? Sorry to ping you but you have been the man with the answers.. @NodeKing Oh okay, not necessary for Android, good to know. Thanks for checking it. I will double check the cordova documentation again. Thanks!. On iOS for some reason during the purchase and refresh I get prompted multiple times to authenticate. During purchase, I have to put in my details three times. Same for restore. I am using the handlers above that @NodeKing provided. My purchase function looks like this:\nasync purchase() {\n    if (!this.platform.is('cordova')) { return };\n\n    let productId;\n\n    if (this.platform.is('ios')) {\n      productId = this.product.appleProductId;\n    } else if (this.platform.is('android')) {\n      productId = this.product.googleProductId;\n    }\n\n    try {\n        console.log(\"purchase: \" + productId);\n\n        let order = await store.order(productId);\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.log('Error Ordering ' + JSON.stringify(err));\n    }\n}\n\n@steve-allan Did you get around to implementing the recommendation?.

    "DevlprArup": "Dear Support Providers,\nWe have finally sorted out this issue. The File Transfer plugin can now be accessed at the Provider where the actual download happens. \nWhat is missing is a CLEAR & DETAILED documentation of ionic native wrapper detailing how to instantiate and use the Native Plugins. I won't call it a bug - but blurry documentation is just a trap for developers. \nI am refraining from posting the solution here - because - a recent Tweet attracted my attention where it was mentioned if developers would wish to get more help in lieu of a subscription. The irony is - we had to invest 3 valuable weeks to make the app run successfully on iOS as the documentation is not adequate.\nThanks. . @kensodemann  Yes .. I do agree with you. And I trust that should be a developer's TRUE SPIRIT.\nI actually sent a direct Tweet to a Boss of the Ionic - seeking help on the issue -- I never received a single word as a response - instead saw a Tweet from the boss proposing subscription based help. \nIt hurts and I AM HURT.. @mlynch \nThanks for responding on my issue.\nWhen I sent a direct tweet to you - I was in extreme confusion with the code and the issue. I failed to meet the deadline - and was utterly clueless. I felt like clutching the last straw when the sea was closing on me. And the proposal of subscription based help just thawed me. \nLet's get back to the code : \nMy issue was that the FileTransfer object could be accessed from inside the platform ready function but not inside a provider - this too on iOS [ Android version is working correctly ]\nHere is what I did:\nAs I need an instance of the FileTransfer inside the provider - i created a variable - and an updater method - \n```\nprivate fileTransfer: any;\npublic setFileTransferRef( param ){\n      this.fileTransfer = param;\n  }\n```\nAnd as I could access the FileTransfer inside the platform.ready() - I instantiated the FileTransferObject right there and updated the provider as follows - \ninitializeApp() {\n    this.platform.ready().then(() => {\n        console.log('fileTransfer: ');   \n        console.log(JSON.stringify(this.fileTransfer));\n        //\n        let fileTransfer: FileTransferObject = this.fileTransfer.create();\n        //\n        this.mediaIOSProv.setFileTransferRef(fileTransfer);\n        .....\n        ....\nWhat I presume is -  [ I may be wrong.. please rectify if needed ]\n1: It would be best to create a Provider to store references of each Native Plugin instantiated within the platform ready - and use the references as and when needed\n2: There might be some information missing, specially regarding iOS, about the Ionic-Native Wrapper\n3: I also placed with the cordova.js inclusion after build/vendor.js in the index.html -  ( I came across some posts where developers reported that doing so solved their missing plugin issue ) - Though there is no such official documentation.\n```\n\n Ionic's root component and where the app will load \n\n The polyfills js is generated during the build process \n\n The vendor js is generated during the build process\n       It contains all of the dependencies in node_modules \n\n cordova.js required for cordova apps \n\n The main bundle js is generated during the build process \n\n\n``\nSince the app successfully ran on iOS - I did not dare to change the placement ofcordova.js` \nAny suggestion is welcome. \n.

When I supplied examples of where the doco was wrong or missing, answer came there none. I have to grit my teeth and allocate a day or so each time I try to use a new native feature - none has ever worked as documented.

Would be nice to get a release that contains that fix before v5. (Or just a v5 release soon\u2122\ufe0f). @ihadeed probably knows more about the v5 ETA. Looks like it's resolved, thanks! . But that's the point of type checking? If I try to use toUpperCase() on a number it would be good if the compiler complains so that I can fix my code? . Yes typescript isn't sure whether value is a string or a number, and usually we (programmers) are not sure either. Usually the code that runs download would have to check what the return value is.\nSee the following example for what I would think is a common use case:\n```typescript\nthis.pro.download().subscribe((value: ProgressMessage) => {\n  if (typeof value === 'string') {\n    // We are either done or it failed we probably would want to check for 'done' and\n    // if so move on with extracting, or else show an error message to the user\n// Here typescript will detect that value is a string within this block, so\n// `value.toUpperCase()` for example will work\nconsole.log(value.toUpperCase()); // This works!\n\n} else {\n    // This is a progress update, we probably want to update a progress bar or similar\n// Typescript will detect that value is a number within this block, so \n// `value.toExponential()` for example will work.\nconsole.log(value.toExponential()); // This works!\n\n}\n});\n```. Nope, TS is smart enough to infer the correct types even with union types.\n\nLuckily, you don\u2019t need to abstract typeof x === \"number\" into its own function because TypeScript will recognize it as a type guard on its own. \n\nSee this example%20%7B%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20We%20are%20either%20done%20or%20it%20failed%20we%20probably%20would%20want%20to%20check%20for%20'done'%20and%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20if%20so%20move%20on%20with%20extracting%2C%20or%20else%20show%20an%20error%20message%20to%20the%20user%0D%0A%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20Here%20typescript%20will%20detect%20that%20value%20is%20a%20string%20within%20this%20block%2C%20so%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20%60value.toUpperCase()%60%20for%20example%20will%20work%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20console.log(value.toUpperCase())%3B%20%2F%2F%20This%20works!%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%20else%20%7B%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20This%20is%20a%20progress%20update%2C%20we%20probably%20want%20to%20update%20a%20progress%20bar%20or%20similar%0D%0A%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20Typescript%20will%20detect%20that%20value%20is%20a%20number%20within%20this%20block%2C%20so%20%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20%60value.toExponential()%60%20for%20example%20will%20work.%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20console.log(value.toExponential())%3B%20%2F%2F%20This%20works!%0D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0D%0A%7D%3B%0D%0A) at the typescript playground.

The NFC plugin tried to deal with UIWebview when in actual fact your app is using WKWebview. A pull request & merge was submitted to the plugin github the other day (V0.7.2) which is fully compatible still with the ionic native wrapper, however the NPM link hasn't been updated yet, so you'll have to wait for the version to be updated or download the zip from the github page and manually add it to your plugins folder.\nFollowing this, your code and app should work fine again.. @jamesanglin Not to sure, assuming the repo creator has to do it. I can make a sub branch and a quick NPM link for the time being, but i'm hoping the creator will update it soon enough. If it's not done by the Wednesday this week i'll make a new one myself for temporary use. For now use my instructions above to get it working.\nA quick note to the moderators.

It has less options but i found it to be more stable regardless of the issue related to this post. The only downside for me is that it can only return FILE_URI not base64.. I was facing the same problem and I couldn't make it work, so I switched to this plugin https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-imagePicker and it works great. I also used ionic native file plugin to get a base64 representation of the file(image).. You use it the same way as you would with the other (telerik) image picker, as is described in ionic docs https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/image-picker/. The only thing that differs one another are the options.\n\n\nimport { ImagePicker } from '@ionic-native/image-picker'; to your 'app.module.ts' file and then add 'ImagePicker' to ngModule's providers array\nimport { ImagePicker } from '@ionic-native/image-picker'; to the component the component that uses the plugin and instantiate the plugin in your component's constructor 'constructor(private imagePicker: ImagePicker) { }'\n\n\njavascript\nthis.imagePicker.getPictures(options).then(photos => {\n    for (let photo in photos) {\n        console.log(photos[photo]);\n    }\n}, err => { \n    console.log(err);\n});\nMy code is slightly syntacticly different from the example in ionic docs, but it does the same thing\nI haven't used any options since i didn't need any but if your application requires just look at available options in the plugin's docs https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-imagePicker \n@XamarinD2k. typescript\nimport { ImagePicker } from \"@ionic-native/image-picker\";\nsorry dont know how i missed it\ngithub truncates it if its not in code tags\n@XamarinD2k . Np. Good luck! @XamarinD2k . I had the same problem. The issue is with android camera permissions. iOS does it inherently while for android you must do it manually. Also, I've ended up using different plugins for the two platforms.\nFor iOS i've used cordova-plugin-image-picker, and for android cordova-plugin-telerik-imagepicker.\nThis is what you must do for android:\nIn the component's constructor where you call the image picker you must request permission from the user\n```typescript\nimport { ImagePicker } from \"@ionic-native/image-picker\";\nimport { Platform } from 'ionic-angular';\nconstructor(private imgPicker:ImagePicker, private platform:Platform) {\n  if(this.platform.is('android')) {\n    this.imgPicker.hasReadPermission()\n      .then((granted:boolean) => {\n        if(!granted) {\n          this.imgPicker.requestReadPermission();\n        }\n      });\n  }\n\n}\n```.

I was hoping someone from Ionic would've chimed in with a fix by now, since the issue is definitely specific to Ionic given that @ffcc's solution works.\nAnyway, I just got a chance to look into this, and it seems like what's happening is that Ionic tries to wrap every plugin method in a promise without accounting for the possibility that the plugin already returns a promise. The apparent fix was just to add (undocumented) success and failure callbacks to my plugin, which should cause Ionic's promise to now work as intended.\nI don't have an Ionic app readily available for testing, so I'm not 100% sure that this fixed the problem, but just let me know if any of you guys still have issues with the latest cordova-plugin-chooser..

Yeah this issue is on the wrong repo it seems, as it looks like its an issue with DevApp. The author of the getting started guide on the official docs has acknowledged that the workaround at the moment is to install the app itself onto your device.. I think this might need wrapping inplatform.ready()`:\nhttps://beta.ionicframework.com/docs/native/#usage-with-angular-apps\n```\nimport { Camera, CameraOptions } from '@ionic-native/camera';\nimport { Platform } from '@ionic/angular';\nconstructor(public navCtrl: NavController,public camera: Camera, public platform: Platform) {}\ntakePicture(){\nplatform.ready().then(() => {\nconst options: CameraOptions = {\n  quality: 100,\n  destinationType: this.camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI,\n  encodingType: this.camera.EncodingType.JPEG,\n  mediaType: this.camera.MediaType.PICTURE\n}\n\nthis.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {\n\n}).then((imageData) => {\nthis.base64Image= \"data:image/png;base64,\" + dataImage;\n\n}, (err) => {\n    console.log(err);\n});\n\n}); // end platform.ready\n}\n```.

I know for example that when saving a new contact, the arrays are working perfectly but when updating, it wasn't overwriting the array. Problem occurred when I tried to overwrite existing information in the array. (validated on iOS) So it might work on Android but not on iOS.. @BatteryAcid What does not work on iOS is both adding and clearing. Well, it does work if I add a breakpoint somewhere so I assume it is some kind of race condition in the native code. Never checked Android and if I check iOS native source code what you mention is the correct behavior.

I've only tested with the simulator.\nThe changes alone in the pull request above are not enough, you have to set the Contact's _objectInstance.rawId field to something before save - will investigate further what the expected values are for rawId.\nMy current workaround is just to set the rawId to the id:\ncontactToUpdate._objectInstance.rawId = contactToUpdate.id;\n. @Bramzor I'm now seeing the following:\n\na clean save on phone numbers works.\nadding an additional number works\nclearing out all numbers works (empty phone number array)\nremoving (overwriting) doesn't work, you can't replace the the phone numbers with a different array of phone numbers and expect it to actually remove the one not included in the new list.   I believe this is what you are also seeing. \n\n\nex:\n- existing: ['555-555-5555'] \n- replace phone numbers array with ['111-222-3333'] will retain the existing 555 number after a save to end up with: ['555-555-5555', '111-222-3333']\n(removed object formatting for brevity)\n\nThis is not the expected behavior I had in mind.

Can anyone help me with this?. @jsfmrydvd  Thanks man. Even though I tried these yesterday, it was not working for me. I found what my issue was, I had cordova-sms-plugin installed inside my plugins folder. Because of that, even though I had installed the plugin by adding this in package.json (\"com.jsmobile.plugins.sms\": \"https://github.com/hazems/cordova-sms-plugin.git\"), it was taking the old plugin. I uninstalled it and now it works seamlessly. Thanks.. @LUNBOX If you have uninstalled the ionic sms plugin, then no need of this line:import { SMS } from '@ionic-native/sms/ngx';. Make sure that you have installed only one sms related plugin installed in your project. You can do so by this commandcordova plugins. This is the [plugin](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-sms) I am using in my project. I don't have any other plugins in my plugins directory for SMS other than that.\nWhile using the plugin I have mentioned, no need to add them in the providers list.
