This will be resolved by #25. Until then, we require that your run with GateKeeper disabled.\n. is dnsmasq running through launchd? If it wasn't start with launchctl, this won't be able to see it.\n. Ah. Good catch. I need to update support / documentation for this scenario. LaunchRocket can basically do that step for you and then it can manage it properly, but it won't currently detect that you've already done it. I think this is fixable without too much work, thanks for the bug report.\n. For your other services do they start properly with \"launchctl load /usr/local/opt/mysql/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist\"? (or sudo equivalent if you are running them with sudo)\n. DNSMasq and LaunchRocket play nicely together (I use it daily). What is currently incompatible (and thus the source of this bug), is the instructions that the formula gives you.\n\nIn the interim until this issue is resolved, all you need to do is either ignore, (or undo if you have already done it) the following part of the caveats:\nTo have launchd start dnsmasq at startup:\n    sudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons\nThen to load dnsmasq now:\n    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist\nThis means you should make sure dnsmasq's plist is NOT in /Library/LaunchDaemons, and that it is not currently running through the above commands, before you try to manage it with LaunchRocket\nLaunchrocket is not currently capable of detecting or managing services installed to /Library/LaunchDaemons (root-level services that start at system boot-up). This is tagged for v0.7.\nFinally, make sure dnsmasq is being run using the as root checkbox, as the nature of the software requires it.\n. Sounds doable, thanks for the suggestion\n. @Orangenhain I believe this solves your issue without having to issue a modal dialog\n. @Orangenhain that is a fair point. However, all of these commands are executed in /bin/sh (by definition of applescript \"do shell script\") and in OSX 10.3 and above, this is just a copy of the bash executable. So, the issue remains that if you never use bash, you possibly don't have homebrew's PATH in your bash profile. I believe there is still a way to make this approach work, but it may require a bit more cleverness. \n. @wilmoore I think this pull request addresses your concerns adequately \n. The binaries are targeted for 10.8. It's unlikely it will run on 10.7 without switching from garbage collection to ARC.

This will be improved (renamed at least, best case scenario I find a better way to automate that part of the build process) as a result of #3 and #4. That said, the binary download that you install also contains (obviously) a compiled binary. The binary is simply the applescript bootstrapper, the actual executed code is packaged inside sudo.app (resources/scripts/main.scpt) as readable text. The reason the .app file is in source control is mainly that I wasn't interested in figuring out how to automate exporting a .app from AppleScript (if you even can), and making xCode bundle it with the .prefpane.\nAs I read your initial comment again, It may be somewhat unclear trying to browse this in Github, as it does not support .scpt file extensions even though the file is plain text.\n. Sorry, accidentally closed that, didn't mean to, and I certainly don't want to dismiss any security concerns\n. @suppernmann yes the applet is created by the AppleScript editor when you export as a .app. The .scpt files are plain text (open fine in Applescript editor as well as textmate2 for me). \nIf you'd like to confirm, you can md5sum \"applet\" from inside the sudo.app package and open up sudo.scpt source file in applescript, export a \"stay open\" app package, and md5sum the applet it generates and compare them (they will match). Effectively, this is how you \"compile\" that code.\n. Given that OSX uses launchd to start it's built in Apache, this should be relatively easy. The biggest change would be dealing with the fact that the default location of this file is in /System and how to manage it safely without being destructive to it. \nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Feb 10, 2014, at 8:05 PM, Donnie La Curan notifications@github.com wrote:\nApache already comes on Mac OS X so I didn't install it with brew.

I don't see any reason why RethinkDB installed with homebrew shouldn't just work out of the box. I checked their formula and it includes a launchd plist that seems to be already compatible\n. I agree, that might be a cool thing to have around. There is a related issue already filed about using the Apple-provided apache (which happens to ship a plist, but it's in a place we don't currently look). You could, in the interim, create yourself a plist using the template that homebrew uses and just replace the ruby variables with the paths to where the Rethink installer put the files.  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/rethinkdb.rb\n. We now have a repo of plists available, with rethinkdb being the initial member. To install this repo, simply brew tap jimbojsb/launchrocket and brew install launchrocket-plists. This will drop the files in /usr/local/etc/launchrocket. As of v0.5.1, you'll still have to manually add the plist. In v0.5.2, LaunchRocket will scan /usr/local/etc/launchrocket automatically when you click \"scan home-brew\" \n. What version are you running? 0.5 from the releases page? or from source code?\n. Cool. Yeah I can add .profile easy enough. There are a few UI bugs with the master branch right now, I prematurely merged #6. \n.

I can easily reproduce this issue, and it's with the plist. The supplied plist uses apachectl to stop and start apache. Apachectl is a shell script, but what ends up happening is that it causes httpd daemonize itself. One of the prime directives of launchd is that launchd shall daemonize things how it sees fit, not the program that is being run. So, launchd \"loses control\" over httpd once it's started. I'm going to close this issue as it isn't specific to LaunchRocket, but I\"m going to open an issue and a pull request for homebrew to resolve this.\n. Mosquitto seems to work fine for me (just installed it fresh). Launchrocket can manage it and their plist looks good. \n\nRabbitMQ seems to leave a rogue \"epmd\" up and running after it stops which I don't think is the direct issue, but it doesn't help. Other than that, RabbitMQ seems to stop and start successfully for me as well.\nApollo is easier -- plist references a file that straight up doesn't exist after install: /usr/local/var/apollo/bin/apollo-broker. \nOne of the core design decisions for LaunchRocket was to trust Apple's launchd to do it's job and tell the truth. Unfortunately, a bad plist can result in launchd telling us a process is running even though it is not :frowning: \nCan you paste a snippet of the LaunchRocket console logs from attempting to start mosquito and rabbit? They are available in the Console app if you filter by \"System Preferences\"\n. One of the things I need to make clearer in the documentation, and or just fix in the code, is that in order for LaunchRocket to control the services, you should not follow any of the directions that home-brew gives you. LaunchRocket manages plist locations for you, and stopping / starting via the command line will only confuse it, as it has no direct visibility to what's actually running, only what launchctl tells it. \nI looked briefly at brew services; It didn't exist when I first started building LaunchRocket and I don't see ever moving to that as a backend as it's a bit naive and assumes you know quite a bit more about launchctl that I would like. Also, it would somewhat preclude users from being able to manage non-homebrew stuff as well. \nLooking at the mosquitto stuff above, the issue is with\n12/03/2014 10:53:33.616 System Preferences[66752]: Executing command: /bin/launchctl load /usr/local/opt/mosquitto/homebrew.mxcl.mosquitto.plist\n12/03/2014 10:53:33.665 System Preferences[66752]: Result of `/bin/launchctl load /usr/local/opt/mosquitto/homebrew.mxcl.mosquitto.plist` was \n12/03/2014 10:53:33.666 System Preferences[66752]: Executing command: /bin/launchctl list | grep homebrew.mxcl.mosquitto\n12/03/2014 10:53:33.697 System Preferences[66752]: Result of `/bin/launchctl list | grep homebrew.mxcl.mosquitto` was\nWe expect no output from launchctl load, but launchctl list should send us back a line of text, and it does not.

Looks right to me. LaunchRocket can only control packages that provide a service. \n. Agreed, this is expected behavior\n. This is not the case, just verified it from the releases page.\n. do you have app signing security turned on?\n. Sorry, I thought I had replied to this. LaunchRocket directly interacts with OSX Launchd. The step this is failing on is asking launchd  for the status of services (whether they are running or not). The error you have here has to do with your El Capitan upgrade, nothing to do with LaunchRocket. Most people report this issue if they had used an El Cap beta at some point and not done a clean install to the final version. The issue is related to some service being quarantined (com.uglyapps.HocusFocusHelper?). Google \"LaunchServices: received XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INTERRUPTED trying to map database\" and you'll see tons of information on the topic. Unfortunately, I have to close this issue as it is not LaunchRocket related at all :(\n. http://lifehacker.com/5743717/create-aliases-for-system-preference-panes-in-mac-os-x. No it cannot. It uses an insecure applescript hack to invoke scripts as root (read the readme). The alternative is significantly more complicated and requires full code signing. I'd love I if someone wanted to contribute that but I don't plan to. . Yes - confirmed that the comments here are correct. If someone wants to issue a PR, I'll happily merge it and tag a new release that fixes this issue. I just don't have the time to code it myself.. Honestly I would expect the order to follow the plist or be alphabetical because of the way it scans the filesystem. This project is mostly abandoned at this point because I don't personally have a need for it anymore. If you're interested in contributing a patch that makes it behave as you want, I'll be happy to merge it.. Can you please post the logs for LaunchRocket that will appear in the Console app?. That\u2019s really unfortunate. That probably means this prefpane is effectively dead. . If someone wants to create a PR that fixes this, I will build and distribute a new version that has the fix. .

The format string used to build the servicePlist string in line 93 needs to be fixed (it's currently generating strings like /opt/homebrew/optredis/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist ... notice the missing '/' in 'optredis')\nobjc\n        NSString *servicePlist = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@/%@/%@%@%@\", optPath, item, @\"homebrew.mxcl.\", item, @\".plist\"];\nApart from that, it's working great for me.

But to be honest I think you are nearing a point where the effort just isn't worth the time.\n\nIt's actually more common than one would think. Never having to change ownership on /usr/local or use sudo for homebrew installed stuff is actually REALLY nice.\nExactly why I wrote this:\nhttps://github.com/wilmoore/homebrew-home\n. > This would solve the problem for all the users using bash.\n\nBut not for people using other shells (e.g. zsh).\n\nSince every shell allows you to set environment variables, this could be as easy as:\nexport HOMEBREW_HOME=/Users/you/.homebrew\n. @jimbojsb: Sure, it should work OK. I think it's a bit of brute force for BASH users; however, it looks like it will always prompt for those using ZSH, so I guess that's fine.\n. ",

I'm on 10.9.2 btw. Weirdness. I'll have to try this again in my clean testing VM.\nI'll have a dig at Apollo, which I don't usually contribute to in homebrew, and see if we can work out what needs fixing there. I suspect that file only exists once another command has been run to create an Apollo broker, but ICBW.\n. Weird. I just ran launchctl load -F ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mosquitto.plist and mosquitto loaded, and I was able to use LaunchRocket to control it. Did the same with RabbitMQ, and it worked... but then both stopped working again.\nOne hint might be that both of these are messaging services which have the potential to listed on the same port (so in reality I only ever want one running at one time - thus LaunchRocket is a great solution). I wonder if the port collision causes OS X to disable one or the other. I didn't realise launchctl was that smart, if so.\n. Confirmed that Apollo works after you create the broker using /usr/local/Cellar/apollo/1.6/bin/apollo create /usr/local/var/apollo per the brew instructions - although again, it only lets you toggle on/off once then seems to cease to work inside LaunchRocket.\n. Wow - homebrew feature I wasn't aware of: brew services\nhttp://robots.thoughtbot.com/starting-and-stopping-background-services-with-homebrew\nI've now just force launchctl loaded all of the homebrew plist files from ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and brew services lists them all as running.\nI just <3 homebrew more and more.

If all here is well, then track down the UI elements in case they do some cutting off of anything before \"@\". @j0k3r sorry, that #76 is about updating stale names, not about handling the @ problem.. Launchrocket only works with plists. You should find a guide how to create a plist. Afterwards, you can add your .plist file to Launchrocket.\nPlease close this issue.

Looks like an incompatibility problem on Yosemite.\n. This morning, it happened again. But now I can manage to remove that file, and do another scan. Any chance from the author of launchrocket to address this problem?\n. I restarted my computer, trying to launch launchrocket again from system settings, it crashed. Then I opened the Console app, set the \"System Preferences\" filter, and then launch the launchrocket app again from the system settings, it crashed as expected, with the following log in the Console app:\n10/22/14 12:00:04.718 PM System Preferences[411]: Initialzing LaunchRocket\n10/22/14 12:00:04.718 PM System Preferences[411]: Initializing service mananger\n10/22/14 12:00:04.718 PM System Preferences[411]: Attempting to load services from plist\n10/22/14 12:00:04.719 PM System Preferences[411]: Initializing service homebrew.mxcl.mysql\n10/22/14 12:00:04.719 PM System Preferences[411]: Executing command: /bin/launchctl list | grep homebrew.mxcl.mysql$\n10/22/14 12:00:05.393 PM ReportCrash[420]: Saved crash report for System Preferences[411] version 14.0 (14.0) to /Users/elgs/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/System Preferences_2014-10-22-120005_Elgss-MacBook-Pro.crash\n.

I found more patterns of crash as follows:\nEach statement below assumes a removal of ~/Library/Preferences/com.joshbutts.launchrocket.plist. \n1, It's guaranteed launchrocket can start at least once, no matter mysql is on or off;\n2, If mysql is not scanned by launchrocket, launchrocket can start as many times as wanted;\n3, if mysql is scanned, launchrocket can only start once;\nIn other words, if mysql is off, the launchrocket works without any problem. However, once the status of mysql changes, no matter from on to off, or from off to on, launchrocket guarantees to crash the next time launchrocket attempts to start.\nI installed my launchrocket through brew cask install launchrocket, the version is 0.7.\n. When the content of ~/Library/Preferences/com.joshbutts.launchrocket.plist is as follows, it guarantees to crash:\nxml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>services</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>homebrew.mxcl.mysql</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>name</key>\n            <string>Mysql</string>\n            <key>plist</key>\n            <string>/usr/local/opt/mysql/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist</string>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n    <key>version</key>\n    <string>2</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n. It seems when this file ~/Library/Preferences/com.joshbutts.launchrocket.plist exists. launchrocket guarantees to crash. @jimbojsb, seen from the crash log and Console log, do you have any idea this problem is from the code in launchrocket itself, or is it from any underlying library code?\n. @jimbojsb any chance to take a look at this problem? I reinstalled both launchrocket and mysql, still doesn't work.\n. Problem seems to have been fixed in 0.7 release. I will do some more thorough tests and will come back here to close this issue if no further problem found.\n. ",

    "MrJoy": "Same thing with any versioned package.. Looking through the code, and how the plist files are named, I am guessing the issue is that the version numbers are dotted, which breaks assumptions in this code.\nConsider what happens with a normal plist name -- e.g. homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist -- here:\n```objective-c\nNSArray *pathComponents = [plistFile componentsSeparatedByString:@\"/\"];\n// [\"\", \"Users\", \"jon\", \"Library\", \"LaunchAgents\", \"homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist\"]\nNSArray *filenameComponents = [[pathComponents lastObject] componentsSeparatedByString:@\".\"];\n// [\"homebrew\", \"mxcl\", \"redis\", \"plist\"]\nNSString *serviceName = [[filenameComponents objectAtIndex:[filenameComponents count] - 2] capitalizedString];\n// \"redis\"\n```\nBut!  Consider what happens with a versioned plist name, like homebrew.mxcl.postgresql@9.6.plist:\n```objective-c\nNSArray *pathComponents = [plistFile componentsSeparatedByString:@\"/\"];\n// [\"\", \"Users\", \"jon\", \"Library\", \"LaunchAgents\", \"homebrew.mxcl.postgresql@9.6.plist\"]\nNSArray *filenameComponents = [[pathComponents lastObject] componentsSeparatedByString:@\".\"];\n// [\"homebrew\", \"mxcl\", \"postgresql@9\", \"6\", \"plist\"]\nNSString *serviceName = [[filenameComponents objectAtIndex:[filenameComponents count] - 2] capitalizedString];\n// \"6\"\n```\nI haven't touched Objective-C in ages so I'm roughing this out in a Playground using Swift so some translation back to Obj-C would be needed, but perhaps something like this would work:\nswift\nvar serviceName = filenameComponents[2..<(filenameComponents.count - 1)].joined(separator: \".\").capitalized\nMy playground, for those who want to validate this approach:\n```swift\nimport Cocoa\nvar str = \"/Users/jon/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql@9.6.plist\"\n//var str = \"/Users/jon/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist\"\nvar pathComponents = str.components(separatedBy: \"/\")\nvar filenameComponents = pathComponents.last!.components(separatedBy: \".\")\nvar serviceName = filenameComponents[2..<(filenameComponents.count - 1)].joined(separator: \".\").capitalized\n// \"Postgresql@9.6\"\n```\nOf course if you wanted to omit the version number, you just need to split on @ then get the first element:\nswift\nvar serviceName = filenameComponents[2..<(filenameComponents.count - 1)].joined(separator: \".\").capitalized.components(separatedBy: \"@\")[0]\n// \"Postgresql\"\nAttempting to blindly translate that back to Objective-C without a convenient way to test that it even compiles:\nobjective-c\nNSArray *serviceName = [[[[[filenameComponents subarrayWithRange:NSMakeRange(2, [filenameComponents count] - 1)] componentsJoinedByString:@\".\"] capitalizedString] componentsSeparatedByString:@\"@\"] objectAtIndex:0];.
