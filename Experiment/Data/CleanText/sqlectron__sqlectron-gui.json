    "krolow": "To answer as well, and give my insight, i'd say for use use:\nuse \"my-file.js\" and use suffix \"database-reducer.js\"...\nFor the usage of \"-\" i do not have one reason only because its the most common in use when we talk about unix style...\nFor the usage of suffix i'd say it would be good when we are in or editor/ide to filter the files that we want to open like in atom, sublime, we would be able to type \"controller\" in the file search and it would list all controller files that we have in the app...\nLike i said its more personal the choice, its just important to keep one standard...\n. for me no problem at all to not have the suffix too, it's just personal preference for usage in (rails, cakephp), but the main idea of issue is to question about keep only one standard, i think it was already answered and we come with a consensus. \n. looks good @maxcnunes you gonna need just to rebase master code once we have merged the files rename of PR #3 \n. looks good, the only thing its about stub that perhaps can follow the one proposed by @esnunes\n:+1: \n. looks good :+1: \n. :+1: \n. are commands of windows/linux cover in this commit or should take a issue a part of that to handle thoses?\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. it wouldn't be better if only update the list instead of have to handle visibility=true/false ?\ni mean return a new list without the things that does not fit the search... so we do not need to handle this loadAll and add the if statement to display block/none\n. yes, go for it :+1: \n. i've also worked in similar feature, i didn't PR over the weekend because i was not happy with the end result... maybe you can check it here: https://github.com/krolow/sqlectron/commit/17df4845bd6d9e98574cf50d758d1cd8e4299731\nand we can comeup with some merge btw both...\n\n. hey i give a look in the code, i don't know anything about the build process so it's hard to say something about that, but about the code seems good\n. @maxcnunes you can use this https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/ in future commits...\n. i'll give a test here in linux\n. yeah its not working in linux i'll attempt to fix it here\n. @darkwisperer nice catch PR are welcome :smile:\n. thx @darkwisperer ;)\n. @maxcnunes @BornaP what might happen in app if defaultDatabase does not exists any longer (example someone deleted the default db), does it handle this error properly?\n. have #106 solved this issue?\n. errrouuu, it is already fixed :laughing: at #90 \nso closing the issue\n. what is the db that you are using @mayconbeserra?\nI could not reproduce in pgsql at least I've got the results that I were expecting...\nYou mention that grid is converting, here it is not happening the change, can you provide as well what is the version of sqlectron in use?\n. alright @maxcnunes mention that might be related with timezone conversion i'll leave to him check\n. yes, +1 for the feature, i was also thinking in implement that, it would be nice to have it\n. I think it's good, i like the approach of open a modal with a full text view in case of double click what do you think? \n. leave to me I can work on that a long of this week for sure\n. I agree :+1: to have one click back and cursor pointer\n. yeah for sure @cperezabo, that's why we are welcome to PR and changes, it would be good to receive from you a PR to improve such behavior... just to get a context, we (when i say we, mainly @maxcnunes) we have built that because we haven't found a good App to query across platform in PgSQL, it was the begin of the idea of sqlectron...\nso for sure it have a lot to improve as we are developers building something to use in our daily bases, it has a lot of UX and features to improve...\nbased on that is why we encourage others to use it, as well improve it by creating PR...\nin the meanwhile it seems enough to only change it back to mouse \"pointer cursor\" and add one mouse click, what do you think?\n. @maxcnunes yeah, collapse sounds a good idea... it would give the felling that you need to click to open that, so for sure it might be as well one approach to go ahead!\n. @cperezabo excited dude, looking for to see your contributions, as said before we are trying to make this project as welcome as possible to accept PR\n. I think to begin a simple solution would be to add a refresh icon in the database, so we would enable refresh fetched data (tables/views/procedures/etc...).\nIt will not be automatic, but at least would give the support to refresh, and it might be a feature useful for other scenarios (like multiple users creating view/tables in same database) it would allow you to refresh and get the new things that others are generating...\nAnd it also would be simple, and it will avoid user to have to close connection and reopen to get the new table/view/etc... like it was described... \nSo I think it would be a good begin, afterwards we can check, some AST or another approach to handle those scenario where CREATE statements are generated through sqlectron...\nWhat do you think guys?\n. may i give a go for it to implement a refresh icon what do you think @maxcnunes @BornaP ?\n. Closes #138 \n. Alright i'll leave it like it is for now, I could found a wait to use \"scroll\" to increase font by a simple way, so I think it can be a new PR to add that\n. Closes #137 \n. it looks good this fixed data table\n. :+1: \n. It has exceed the size, perhaps if we resize the gif github will allow again\n.

I'm not sure if is the case for sqlectron the idea is to keep it as simple query builder.

So maybe someone can try to fix the issue\n\ud83d\udcaa. would you like to contribute for this improvement?. @a2nt would you like to contribute for those improvements?\n\nRun SELECT * FROM Table LIMIT 1000 on table click\n\nI think is not the best default as some tables might contain a lot of rows, and react is not good in render a lot of items\n\nShow/Hide SQL query field\n\nSounds good, we are glad to receive it as a PR\n\nInline table editor\n\nI'm not sure if I understand this\n\nSort tables on header click\n\nYou mean sort only the elements that are visible in the current query, or actually change the query when click in one row?. Can you give a bit more of details?\nI don't use private keys often, so maybe a bit more of description might help others to help solve this issue \ud83d\udc4d . probably is one issue from our sqlite connector\nI don't think is something easy to implement as it would involve another protocol to be implemented (maybe I'm wrong), maybe you can try to use some sync the samba file in your side?\nI will close the issue as it is not directly related to sqlectron. perhaps your stub can already follow the one proposed: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron/wiki/Database-connections-file-descriptor\n. why we have this pre in case of error?\n. about the name, \"session\" looks a bit strange for me... perhaps we can use getDBConnection or some other thing, it's more a database connection or connection instance than a session...\nwhat do you think?\n. It would't be better to place into the app the image, i can imagine the scenario where we are without internet connection and it might not load the logo image\n. perhaps here can be\n``` javascript\nif (!rows[position]) {\n  rows[position] = [];\n}\nrows[position].push(data);\n```\n. i thought about that... i have even added that... but imagine that you are editing one connection you have added mysql but actually it was pgsql... should we disallow default port?\nfor me it makes sense too to not change when have state but while i was testing i found it a bit weird... \ne.g\nYou choose PgSQL we change the defaultPort...\nYou choose now MySQL (state is already filled by pgsql default port) what should we do in this case?\nI can added some handle for that scenario, to check if user has changed port manually we leave the state of port untouched but if user has not interact with port input and database engine was changed we change the default port\n. @maxcnunes so i have change here so only if user has not choose any port we gonna apply default one...\nbut i need to add one handle to ignore that while save the file\n. I didn't think so as the rest of interface might not be affected by the change only the editor...\nIf we apply in menu, for me it might give the felling that whole app should increase the font, and it's not the case...\n. for sure, it would also impact, if you press the command without the focus in the ace editor, it would need some actions to change some store state through reducers to enable increase the font...\nif it worth the effort i can implement... but i'm not sure if it worth\n. does not need to use template string\n. does not need to use template string\n.

    "maxcnunes": "I have seen many open source projects nowadays with react using camel case for filenames. But I personally don't like it. I prefer using the unix style for any filename.\nRelated to suffix I think they are redundant since the folder name already has the suffix value. You can still use the fuzzy search from sublime and atom to find the file. Just have to include in the search the folder name and filename. But in case you prefer using the suffix I have no problems with that.\n. :+1: \n. Ok.. I will let these changes related to connections to who is going to implement the loading of connections from the configuration file.\n. Since I use CmdOrCtrl key it should work in any platform or keyboard. Could you find any command that wouldn't work in some platform?\n. Initially I implemented such as you said. But I realised once you have changed the state filtering the list you would not have the initial state with all items anymore. This was the only way I find out filtering the list without lose the whole list. Do you have any idea how better implement it?\n. Can I merge it?\n. I visually prefer mine because it is more compact and simpler. But in case you prefer your own solution I'm ok using yours. Also your solution looks like don't show the current connected database, then we would need show this information somewhere.\n. Merging it to master for now. We can change it later.\n. Since the idea is keep it simple. I guess we don't really need it :)\n. Already is possible to copy the values to the clipboard. And since nobody has asked this feature I will close it.\n. Already implemented in https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/1be65a4fe636422bf03869c5460756332e8819d9.\n. It has already been implemented in 78d1e50e32b575bc68019e24a1a141d0361b9c91\n. We could achieve this feature through RegExp. But this could be extremely fragile for more complex queries. The better option would be using a SQL parser like this one https://github.com/dsferruzza/simpleSqlParser. But any SQL parser for Node still missing a lot of development to be consider reliable. So, while we don't have a reliable SQL parser available this feature will not be implemented. \n. The idea of this client is keep it the most simple possible. So I guess we will not implement it.\n. I don't really care that much saving my DB passwords in plain text. If someone else is interested implementing it, please let me know.\n. Actually is with no password. At least the username is required.\n. Fixed on https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/c98c32b0d35cd70cd927b1d7527540ac4d3fb62b\n. awesome :+1: \n. Actually I changed to use CmdOrCtrl+Enter instead of keep the previous CmdOrCtrl+E.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/66004231ccfe5e240ee428a63c7c2539bc257d76\n.

Nobody has asked it. And the current solution seems is working fine. So I'm closing it for now.\n. Closed on https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/f0284a92ec484da1d8ec0dd37b3271c40493d8fd\n. We could use regex to identify the current selected query. But it could get a bit trick for some cases.\nActually the best solution would be using a SQL tokenizer. But seems there isn't any really good in node.\nSo I'm closing this issue, at least for now.\n. I tried to reproduce it again today and I couldn't. So I'm closing this issue.\n. Fixed for windows too f677b9d51244c2b4193889b11eed21f3570747c0\n. I have not seen it anymore. Closing it while does not happen again.\n. Fixed on commits: faa6f99a6140c992a145dc6c5d27adae8d7b6239 and f285a98ae6247cad5c023f94f5071e21865a77ed\n. Fixed on commit 7f76a71bb144f027dafe90619a42cb66ce01e92c\n. Fixed on commit 7f76a71bb144f027dafe90619a42cb66ce01e92c\n. When you say \"columns\" you mean \"tables\" right?\nWell, this is an expected behaviour. Since I usually work with micro services is pretty common I have to go over different databases to fetch the final data. If you don't want go get distracted by the other databases maybe you could just filter in the search box by the current selected database. Ok?\n. It is happening here too :(\nI can take a look on this later today.\n. Yeah, that is a good idea :+1: \n. I can take a look on this to see if is possible.\nBy the way I think your problem is in the address. Although is possible use this address format in SQL Server Management Studio, in Sqlectron you need to use IP+Port.\n\nTo connect through IP+Port I also had to follow these steps:\n- http://dba.stackexchange.com/a/62300\n- http://dba.stackexchange.com/a/62166\nIf you are connecting from a different machine you also will need to disable the firewall or create a rule allowing connections to the MSSQL port.\n. I have improved the error handling during the connection. So, I guess we can close it.\n. Does this problem occurs without the brackets? By the way, what is the reason of the brackets, I guess I have never seen brackets in a SQL query before :smile: .\n. Humm. We are not setting the ssl attribute (current configuration and example postgresql with ssl) to the db connection configuration.\nWe gonna need a new button in the interface to enable the SSL support and pass this configuration ahead until the sqlectron-core.\nI guess I can take a look on this today.\n. Yeah. That is really helpful. I will do it later today.\n. Hi @bwiggs. I think after a brew update you gonna be able to install the Sqlectron through the brew cask. Let me know if something goes wrong.\n. Somehow the app still open on clicking in the close button. Although using Command+Q it closes properly.\n. That is weird. The connection is working here.\nmysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.10, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper\nAlthough I really can't create a new server connection if I don't check the SSL option.\nThis way works:\n\n\nMy MySQL server is not running locally but it should not differs from yours.\n\nWhat is weirder is that after creating the server connection with SSL enabled I'm able to edit it to SSL disabled.\nI guess it is an workaround you can use for now. I'm going to take a look in this problem later, probably is just some misunderstanding in the validation.\n. I have just tested on Windows 8 and it is working. I can take a look on that using Windows 10 only after 01/04. When I get back to my place where there is a much better internet to download a VM with Windows 10. :sob: \nBy the way, have you tried running it with Windows 8 compatibility? It might work. :pray: \n. I guess was a problem during the build for windows. I have released a new version  https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/tag/v1.3.0 and its working on my VM with windows 10. Please @jasonCodesAway, could you check it out?\n. Closing it now. Let me know if you find any problem.\n. My mistake. It already works.\n. Fixed the first issue.\nI have fixed the second one for PG and MSSQL. But MySQL considers a commented query as a non select query. Since is not possible without hacks to figure it out, this problem will continue to happen for MySQL.\nThough to cause less confusion I will include a FAQ window listing the particularities of each client.\nRelated commit: 719f47096aaa32414dd4572f85396e05a83dce6b\n. I tried to implement it. But after the query result has started to rendering by react is not possible to cancel the rendering. So I will close it while I don't have a better idea an time to implement it.\n. It was initially a feature to prevent the user executing the same query repeatedly. To avoid unnecessary calls. But it was a bad idea. I will change it.\n. The lib we use to build the tabs (https://github.com/reactjs/react-tabs) does not support the event onMouseUp, required to handle \"custom\" mouse events. So would be required create a pull request to react-tabs including that event before implementing it here. I don't have much interest implementing it because I don't really use it that much. But I would gladly accept a pull request with this feature :smile: \n. Well, there are a few options for that:\n- Implement that on react-tabs and use the new branch (in case they don't accept the pull request).\n- Find out another actively maintained react tab component (even better if has that feature already).\n- Instead of use the cursor to close the tab. We could implement a shortcut for that (e.g. Ctrl/Cmd+W) ( I would like this one).\n. Thanks :smile: \n. This change is related with your other pull request. I will reject it here and include again after some changes I have to do in your other pull request.\n. It is a vendor file. We should avoid if possible changing it. I will include this change in another file.\n. Awesome contributing. Right now I am on vocations. So I will take a look on this when I get back to work. Mean while could you check if the sidebar still scrolling separately from the right? It was a feature some people asked me (https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/65).\nThanks!\n. Even with some problems in your pull request I will accept it and apply the fixing myself since I already know how to fix them.\n. Done. Let me know if it still working as you were expecting.\n. @darkwisperer Since the database name will be required only for PG. I suggest using the group configuration for the validation (example).\n. I'm ok with this solution. It is what I usually do manually when I don't know the database name in the PG.\n. If I implement that first option: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/103#issuecomment-204993640. The database parameter would be removed from the route.\nMaybe while while the user is not connected to a database. The query-box should be hidden e even show a message \"Select a database\".\n. If the idea is allow the user execute queries without be connected to a specific database. I prefer let the query-box visible already. But I am not sure how the app is gonna handle executing queries without database. I guess there are a lot of stuff related to database. But I can be wrong. Is something to try out and see how goes.\n. I guess you have a problem with PG because you resolve the database name during the connection here. And the interface by default will use the \"default\" database during the connection here.\nMy suggestion is:\n- Expose in the sqlectron-core a variable like defaultDatabase here\n- Include the defaultDatabase as a third argument here\n. Good catch!\nI don't have much time to fix it right now. If you could send a pull request I would gladly accept it :smile: \n. Sorry @darkwisperer. I was hoping release it earlier. But I have upgraded the build configuration. and I have not got it working properly yet. I hope finish it until this weekend.\n. Good idea @darkwisperer  and @BornaP :+1: \nI have thought bout it as well in the beginning of the project https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/24. Some time later I closed that issue to keep the app more \"minimalist\".\nBut since there are people interest in this feature I would gladly accept a pull request for it :dancers:  \nI prefer the mysql workbench approach. Seems more organized at least. Is important to also think in those DBs that have scheme such as PG (I guess oracle as well). Would be necessary keep all this structure for each scheme. Example:\n\n(Example from https://www.navicat.com/products/navicat-for-postgresql)\nI also like the idea of keeping the interface simple and hiding this \"advanced\" information by default and activating it through some button in the database. But I guess this could have its own issue.\n. Hi @BornaP. I think you are in the right path. All the solutions you presented sounds a good approach!\n. Closing this issue since it has already been merged to master.\n. It has already been fixed in v1.5.0. https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/b878fbd19e32a31636dd936c8aa4dba387d37d3a :dancers: \n. Awesome pull request!! I'm gonna test it locally before merging.\nRelated to the found bugs/improvements. I agree it is better create separated issues for them.\n. Thanks @BornaP :clap: \n. I spent some time trying to fix it. But it is a bit more complicated then I thought.\nNowadays every time a new DB connection is opened. We refresh the app.\nBecause of that I see 3 solutions:\n1. Do not use history.pushState anymore to connect into a new DB. (I guess would be some quite work).\n2. Use nested routes. This way we could associate each database item in the side bar with its own route. I think when you change a inner route the redux will keep the same state to the parent components. But I not sure about it. (I guess would be some quite work too).\n3. I think this the worst approach. But it is the easiest as well. Store any state that must be kept between connections. \n. @krolow any ideas?\n. In the last approach I was thinking in keep the state of toggled databases in the database store (reducer state). This way the state wouldn't be lost on changing the database connection (which changes the page). But I don't think this is a good approach. At least all examples I have seen in internet for filter states, it is stored inside the component instead of the store.\nBut I found something weird right now. If there is something in the database filter input on changing the database. That value is not lost as the toggled databases. Maybe we could do the same for the toggled databases. The difference in the filter databases is that the state is stored in the container (here) instead the element.\n. But I still prefer the first option.\n. I have started implementing the first option. @BornaP I suggest waiting for these changes before working in anything else. Otherwise, probably you gonna have a lot stuff to resolve conflict during the merge.\n. @BornaP I have not fixed it yet. But my last commit https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/811098cc18a2a6698ec0ad93bcd19e0dca90507d allow you keep going in the other stuff you are working on.\n. Fixed on commit 9967d66ef7c268d6e0bf8da4dccbbeb2ce5e8df4\n. Thanks @BornaP for catch it.\nI have tested with electron 0.37.4, which has a fix for a bug with IPC. But it still not working.\nI will keep trying the next new versions until it works. For now lets stay with the 0.36.12 version.\n. Your change may cause problem in another situation. For example: I am already connected to a database. And I try to connect into another database in the same server. If this new connection crashes, it will close all the other connections as well - https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/db/server.js#L36.\nMaybe a solution is checking if there is only one database \"connected\" before closing the server session.\n. The sessionServer handles all connections to a same saver. Since is not possible to connect into multiple servers at same time. Should exists only one sessionServer per time. So I don't think your suggestion would be the best approach.\nI think, if a session connection fails we should not keep it in memory. It should be discarded. So is better improve the error handling then keep failed sessions consuming memory unnecessarily. \n. Thanks @BornaP :clap: \n. You can execute the binary file directly from there. But usually on linux is recommended to move the application directory into the /opt directory.\n. Sure. I was not totally fine with this result. But it was already better than the previous one.\nWhat do you think about this attempt?\n\nIt uses the same font-size of the children and has a collapse icon.\n. Cool. I'm gonna try that later today then. I hope finish it today, to release a new version. It's been a while since the last release.\n. I have included a margin left for the menu. And also changed the color of the metadata titles to have a bit of less attention than the database title.\n\n. Thanks :clap: \n. That is weird. Let me know if you need help with it.\n. lol twich. Thanks :clap: \n. @BornaP before I merge, could you include the new version o sqlectron-core in the package.json?\n. Weird. I will try to remember testing this situation on upgrading the electron again. Thanks for the pull request @BornaP :clap: \n. I thought in 3 options:\nA. change the database search to include some filters. This way would have a global search. (Would be applied only in the loaded data. e.g. If a database is not connected, would not be possible to search for its tables).\nInitial state:\n_Search database..._ [search][+]\nAfter clicking in the [+]:\n_Search database..._ [search][+]\n_Search table..._\n_Search views..._\n_Search functions..._\n_Search procedures..._\n\nThe items with underscore are the fields and with brackets are the buttons :laughing: \n\nB. Include the search over Tables. Which would search for any matada in that database. (I like the simplicity of this one and is already enough for me).\nC. Include the search under all metadata headers. (I think this is not necessary)\n. That was a weird bug. I would not have thought that. Thanks @BornaP :clap: \n. Thanks @AndiDog. I will fix it later today.\n. I could not reproduce this bug. Maybe is something that have been fixed already by another change. Could you teste it in the new version (v1.6.0)?\n. @AndiDog and @darkwisperer could you confirm if it really still happening?\n. @darkwisperer sorry, I didn't quite understand. Did the windows installer of 1.6.2 work for you? What in the installer was glitched out and unreadable?\n. The best approach would be not parsing the data from the DB to nodejs. Which all the sql clients does by default.\nThe Mysql client has a configuration typeCast for that. But seems PG and MSSQL does not have that configuration available. I don't have much time for that right now. So any PR is well come \ud83d\ude04 \n. The code looks good for merge. Could you please provide a screenshot then I can evaluate the layout as well?\n. I think that is all right. Not sure if will be a bit annoying the filter box always visible for every database.\nBut we can think better about it let this possible change to another issue.\n. Thanks @BornaP :+1: \n. Yeah. That would be an awesome feature. I don't have much time to implement it right now. But if you are  interested in implementing it. Please do. Let me know if you need help in anything.\nBy the way. Looks like ace has support for auto complete - https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/How-to-enable-Autocomplete-in-the-Ace-editor.\n. The metadata is now loaded into the auto completion list. I guess is just missing apply the custom configurations to consider this task done. I can work on that tomorrow.\n. Completed with https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/a50497c79ba6bfed1e856f4aea1fe73c132e48d2\n. Thanks @insha. I am working on it.\n. Fixed in the version 1.6.1. Could you please check if it works for you?\n. Thanks @hardliner66. I am working on it.\n. This only occurs on windows. I will fix it later today.\n. Reason why the release for windows is not working - https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/336.\nBut I still trying to fix it.\n. @hardliner66 or @darkwisperer could someone test it with the version 1.6.2?\n. Using the version 1.6.2 - https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/download/v1.6.2/Sqlectron-1.6.2.dmg ?\nIt is working for me: OSX 10.11.4.\n. Thanks. That was a bug created on version 1.6.0 and fixed on version 1.6.1. Glad is working now for you.\n. Your approach fetching the columns look good.\nRelated to appearance, I guess is everything too similar. Some icons could help on that:\nBefore:\n\nAfter\n\n<i className=\"table icon\" style={{float: 'left', margin: '0 0.3em 0 0'}}></i>\n<i className=\"columns icon\" style={{float: 'left', margin: '0 0.3em 0 0'}}></i>\nI guess the current behaivour to show the columns is a hidden feature. As a user I don't know if I would know is possible to list the columns. Maybe a title in the table could help (e.g. \"Click once to... Click twice to...\"). Is a bit ugly but at least is more visible. What do you think?\n. Your suggestion of using collapse icon and submenus for columns and triggers looks good. Although I am not sure is really necessary move them to a separated component. Try out what looks better.\nI agree moving the standard select query to a context menu. Actually @krolow  was talking with me this week about using context menus to do execute some few standard queries over the table, such as: select, insert, delete. So if you move the standard select query to a context menu is already a good progress for that feature.\nI guess on MySQL workbench clicking over a column will just include the column name in the query box. Not sure what is best solution. I guess yours is more useful. But I gonna let you decide this one \ud83d\ude04 \n. That is awesome. The only thing I think could be improved is the typography for the columns. I think the columns looks a bit too small and thin. But I guess that is something we can release this way and see what the other users think about that.\nBy the way it is a great feature and your code style is pretty easy to read. Congrats!!\nAgain, thanks for the PR \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \n. Do you mean that image? That is a default gif visible during the installation. https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#buildwin\nIf the problem you are describing is really that I can ask to my brother (how created the Sqlectron logo) to  create a gif for Sqlectron installation.\n. @markcnunes this gif is visible during the installation of the app on Windows.\nBut since that is too much generic is a bit confusing what that represents.\nCould you prepare a gif for Sqlectron with a spinner and some describing message such as \"Installing... Please wait.\"?\n. Implemented in this commit https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/ee4c7b8a2cbb1d5991a44e20899cba6be7bea0fa\n. I have tested it and it is working pretty well. For some reason ace does not have support for all common SQL keywords such as LIKE. But seems have support for most of them.\nWe can take a look in the future on react-ace to check if that problem have been fixed. For while I think is not a problem use a fixed version for react-ace.\nLet me know if you need help including table names and columns in the autocomplete. I can take a  look on that as well. Maybe we will need follow the same approach of WagnonHQ extending the ace editor. But lets keep it simple if possible.\nAlso, I think maybe not everyone likes auto complete. Me for instance, I like them some times, but most of time I feel them a bit annoying. Could have an option to disable/enable the auto complete. Could be a configuration from the config file or a shortcut to toggle it. Also would be cool if was possible to disable the auto complete and only show the suggestion keyword on typing CTRL+SPACE or something like that. But these are changes we have to discuss more about. Lets keep for another issue/PR.\nThanks again for the PR \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \n. @BornaP I will have some free time only in the weekend. Since you have found the solution and looks like be pretty simple to implement. If you are free to work on this and is excited to work on that, please do. Otherwise let me know than I can work on that in the weekend.\n. @BornaP I have implemented the auto completion list with the database metadata (commit).\nBut I found out sometimes while I'm typing the query it is jumping the cursor to end of the query.\nI hope fix that tomorrow.\n. Hi @mayconbeserra,\nThis query is creating a very large buffer which is reaching the memory limit.\nI guess  the amount of memory you have available does not support loading that much data at once.\nThe only thing I think we can do is force paging any SELECT query when the user does not include an LIMIT. We already sort of do that, but it is only done in the front end (which already improves a lot the performance in the rendering). Although doing that in the backend can be pretty trick depending in the query (e.g. queries with comments). We would need have the AST of the query to ensure that is a SELECT query and does not have yet a LIMIT. Unfortunately nodejs does not have any really good SQL parser. Then we would need write a SQL parser for that. Or even better write a binding for nodejs from existing SQL parsers from C. That would be pretty awesome to do and would give us an incredible analyse over the query. But I don't really have that time available right now for that.\nSo sorry. I can not do anything about that than ask you to include LIMIT in your query. \ud83d\ude22 \n. Maybe is possible to avoid this problem by using a cursor or streaming the result which we could pause the stream between pages. Reopening to see what we can do about it. Although this problem could still happening if the user went over all pages (because would allocate all data into the memory). At least would not crash the app at first moment.\n. Debugging the problem. Seems like the memory leak happens on electron while it prepares the response  from the main process to the renderer process. I'm planing in replacing the remote IPC calls with HTTP requests over a HTTP server running in the main process. It would allow use streams to response the query results. Which I guess would fix this problem. I still testing this approach. Lets see if it works. But I guess it will. Because IPC calls are not recommended way to transfer large data.\n. I have spent some time trying to figure out the best way to replace the IPC call with data stream. These are the results of the tests with stream for each client:\n- mysql - Has support to stream single or multiple query statements.\n- pg - Has support to stream only single query statement.\n- mmsql - I have not tested. Not sure if has support to stream multiple query statements.\nSince only one client has support for streaming multiple query statements (based on what I have tested). I don't think is worth changing the process to execute queries with stream and Promise support. Also this problem only occur on selecting hundred thousand rows. Which should be avoid most of the time. Therefore, right now I will not work on this issue. But I will let this issue open, in case we find a better solution in the future.\n. Pretty handful feature. Thanks for the PR @rodrigowirth \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \nThere is only one problem. Your implementation does not work on executing the query through the short key. But no worries, I can fix that \ud83d\ude04 \n. @krolow do you mind implementing it? \ud83d\ude04 \n. Awesome. No rush \ud83d\udc83 \n. Hey @BornaP, are you working on this one? I could take it otherwise.. Implemented at https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/358. At the beginning we had a pointer cursor on passing the mouse over the database. But we changed that to default cursor because you have to double click to open the database. And the pointer cursor is a common style for one click. The database name has a tooltip saying you can click twice to open the database. But that only appears if you stop the mouse over the database name.\nBut you are right, we have to make it more clearer for new users. I going to try out some stuff and see which goes better.\nThanks for the feedback.\n. I disagree with these options:\n- pointer cursor + one click: as @BornaP said it will make users open a new connection by mistake.\n- pointer cursor + double click: is not the expected behavior for the pointer cursor. Pointer cursor must trigger an action in the first click.\nI propose to have the same behavior of MySQL Workbench.\n- All the databases have a collapse icon.\n- It always use default cursor over the database.\n- Clicking twice in the whole row of the database (not only the name) will open a new connection and change the collapse icon to open.\n- Clicking twice again collapse the database information and change the collapse button to closed.\n- Does not have any tooltip about this behavior.\n\n. @cperezabo if you are not interested in diving into the code to implement it just let me know. I don't mind implementing it for next release. Although since it is a simple change this would be a good opportunity to know the code.\n. I just realized it still working only on clicking in the name. I will try improve that again \ud83d\ude04 \n. Even the auto refresh looking a best solution. We can not implement that because there is not a properly way to detect the query type in nodejs. Regex is not a good option and the best solution would be using AST of the query (which there is not any good one available in nodejs - is the same problem described here).\nSo the current best and simple solution is including a refresh button.\n. Sorry. In this case there is no simple solution. Your suggestions would not work with many situations \ud83d\ude22 \nsql\nINSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('I have created something today');\nor\nsql\n-- query created at 11/09/2011\nSELECT * FROM mytable;\nor\nsql\nSELECT id, name, createdAt FROM people;\nor\nsql\nSELECT * FROM creations;\nThese are only the few simple cases I have just thought about right now. I'm sure there are others even more complex that a string \"search\" or even Regex would not work. Only a AST of the query would give us the full understanding of the query to be able to \"react\" over the content.\n. TLDR I guess will be possible to implement this auto reloading feature. I am working on it.\nSince having a AST would give us some good analyse power over the executed queries. I tried find out some good sql-parser in node. But every parser I found is not fully implemented. Then I decided trying to create a bind from some existing one from C. But that would require creating a bind for each database client and some of them would not be possible because are private source (mssql). So my next attempt was writing a sql parser my self in node. But after some hard working and fun I just realised would take some free time that I am not really interesting in investing right now. So my last attempt was writing a sql parser only for our main needs. Which is identify the query statement types (e.g. Insert, Select, CreateTable, and etc.). sql-query-identifier is the result of this idea.\nThe postgres client already returns the query identifier (I guess is because of that the Postico hava that feature to auto reload tables after creating them). So my main idea is add to sqlectron-core this new feature returning the query type for each executed statement. sql-query-identifier will be used as fallback for every database which does not return the statement type (I guess only postgres will not use it).\n. Closing this issue since have been implemented on #156 and #160.\n. Since all sqlscripts has the same behavior I guess is good reason to gather them all.\nBy the way awesome PR \ud83d\udc4d \n. Related to your 2 suggestions. Please do that \ud83d\udc4d \nFeel free to merge it into master after you have updated the sqlectron-core version.\n. Awesome. I have sent the PR including Sqlectron to the list of apps.\nLets upgrade!!! We just have to be careful and test well. Because we had some problems with the latest attempts to upgrade the electron.\n. Sure. Lets wait until that error has been resolved.\n. Hi @Grelek,\nThe build script requires the compile script have been ran before.\nCould you try to execute npm run dist instead? I have never tried on Arch Linux. I hope that works.\n. There are some required packages to build the app: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build#linux.\nWeird npm run compile && npm run build:linux should have the same behavior of npm run dist.\n. I'm gonna install a Ubuntu VM to see how it goes.\n. @Grelek \nI have installed a VM with Ubuntu 16.04. The build works following these steps:\nbash\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install nodejs git-core icnsutils graphicsmagick xz-utils\nnpm install\nnpm run dist\nThe executable is in dist/Sqlectron-linux-x64/ and dist/Sqlectron-linux-ia32/.\nI was using:\n- node 5.11.1\n- npm 3.8.6\n- git 2.7.4\nI have also download the ISO for Arch Linux. I will try later on that as well. But maybe take a bit more time because I have not used Arch linux before.\n. Sorry @Grelek, I could not get a Arch Linux running. The only VM I found with Arch Linux didn't work. But since it works on Ubuntu I guess this is probably a problem with some missing package or even using a different version of some package.\n. @Grelek  Could you try these steps below?\n1. Remove the node_modules from the root directory of the project\n2. Remove the node_modules from the app directory\n3. Install the deps with npm install (please provide the log)\n4. Build the app with npm run dist (please provide the log)\n5. Attach here the dist generated folder.\n. Could you try if this one built on Ubuntu works for you?\nhttp://expirebox.com/download/459f6420e2979a0385aaaffe49ebd3be.html\n. Seems is everything ok with the npm install. npm run dist should have generated an output similar to this one https://gist.github.com/maxcnunes/7e03203a76e89db258db2e93b02b8149#file-sqlectron-npm-run-dist-log (although this one is for mac).\nSince is possible to use the build from Ubuntu. Is there a reason to you not use them? We could include them in the release files.\n. @Grelek now sqlectron has installer support for more Linux distros. Does the pacman or any other works for you? https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/tag/v1.10.0\n. @Grelek I guess I have fixed that. Could you check again please? https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/tag/v1.11.2-beta.0\n. Awesome \ud83c\udf89 \n. The good think about the modal is that we could prettify the data there. So you could show in plain text and have options to show as JSON, XML or event HTML.\nBut as you said, your approach + FixedDataTable solves the main problem of #126. So I guess that modal is just a nice to have and we can move that idea for another issue.\n. Sure. I will let it enabled by default then.\n. Ok, so a wiki it will be \ud83d\ude04 \n. Exactly.\n. I guess this issue could be break down in 2 PR:\n1. allowing the user select the default schema during the connection (in the server management screen).\n2. listing the schemas in the database list as @BornaP said.\n. Done on https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/tag/v1.19.0. Neither do I. Although there are people that sure use that. Yeah the modal is the correct way \ud83d\udc4d \n. Is possible to get the current database with this.props.queries.queriesById[this.props.queries.currentQueryId].database even if the focus is not currently in the query box.\nI think F is not the better letter to use as bind for this. If one day we implement search in the query box content I guess F seem like the perfect key binding for that. I tried find out another letter available, but seems most of them already have some function inside the query box. The character . does not have any function with Ctrl. I guess replacing F with . could work.\nAbout the bug you described, I will try run your code locally to try find out a solution for that.\n. Trying to fix the bug you described I realized this approach does not really requires state changes.\nIs much easier achieve that exposing the focus function and executing it from outside of the component.\nMy changes: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/c986e8a771abb7658e66ddabfdf9558d76063f74\n. I guess is just missing choose what bind key we gonna use for that.\n. Close it since have been implemented here https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/162.\n. I guess there is two reasons for this button:\n1. Allow refresh the database for those types the auto refresh does not have support yet (e.g. views).\n2. Allow refresh the database in case someone else has created for instance a new table.\n. - Here it shows all the available rows until the bottom of the window. Only if it has less rows to reach the bottom of window then the table will adapt to the height of the available rows.\n- That error does not happen here. It used to happen on resizing the window. But that stopped when I added a debounce for the resizing.\n- Initially I tried to keep the ellipsis. But didn't work in the first attempt then I just gave up. Since is possible to resize the column. I will try again a bit more. About the width I though was 220 letters. My bad, will change the width for pixels.\n. I'm trying to resize in different times and speed and it really does not happen. Lets merge to master with the current debounce time. Then you can change to a value the does work for you. Deal?\nBy the way, what OS are you using?\n. This would be an awesome feature. Not sure which library is the best for ERD diagramas. Seems like JointJS has a better documentation/support. I have found this GoJS (erd example http://gojs.net/latest/samples/entityRelationship.html). But I am not sure it is free.\n. It is looking pretty cool. I agree with all your suggestions of implementation. They seem the right approach.\n. That is weird. Most of the connections I use are over SSH. Could please include this sqlectron server configuration ~/.sqlectron.json.\nImportant: replace the values that are secret such as host, database, user, password with secret.\nAlso what is the OS and the sqlectron version are you running?\n. Hi @plandevida,\nLooks like you have not configured the connection to use the SSH Tunnel.\nHere is an example:\n\nCould you test that and let me know if it works?\n. Ok. I have found the problem. The test connection with SSH Tunnel is not working without saving the configuration. Try to save it then connect. It should work.\n. Weird. In case it occurs again, please try to find on ~/.sqlectron.json the configuration for the problematic connection and include that in the issue (change secret values before that). That might help find what is the problem.\n. Wow. Maybe one day we gonna be able to update to electorn 1.x \ud83d\ude06 \n. I have upgraded my pg branch. Since pg is a dependency based in a branch I guess there is no need releasing a new version of sqlectron-core. Just installing sqlectron-core should a get new version of pg module.\n. Seems is not working properly. At least I cant connect over SSH. Could you check if it is working for you? Maybe we need revert again to 0.36.12 \ud83d\ude22 \n. The few minutes I tried investigating it I could not find the solution or even the exactly problem. Since I hope releasing a new version this week I guess is better revert it now. And later we try again upgrading it.\nBy the way I planning replacing the remote calls with HTTP requests. I hope after that change we will have less problems with electron.\n. I guess this is the problem https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/5736. I am reverting to the previous used version. But lets try to upgrade again once that PR is merged.\n. Hmm, I don't think we have changed anything to improve that. I will try to reproduce it again. Thanks for checking it out.. Hi @CommanderXL,\nMy Mac is 10.11.4. I have tested both Sqlectron-1.8.0-mac.zip and Sqlectron-1.8.0.dmg and they are working properly for me.\nHave you tried the Sqlectron-1.8.0.dmg as well?\nIs there any error message on opening the app?\n. I dont think that. There is a guy at my office that uses  Mavericks version and sqlectron works for him.\nMaybe is not running because you have not allowed apps from unidentified developer. Could you check that?\n. @CommanderXL Since I have not heard of you in almost a month I going to close this issue. I hope that has worked for you. Otherwise, please just re open this issue.\n. Looking in this error on stackoverflow seems you have to connect over HTTPS. Try to enable the SSL option on sqlectron server connection.\n. I just remembered there was a bug not setting the SSL attribute on PG connections. It was fixed here. But we have not released a new version after that. I'm planing in release it this week. Sorry for the trouble.\n. The new version with the fixing for this bug was released yesterday.\n. Do you need use the .pem file to connect into a server through SSH Tunnel? I guess including the .pem file as Private Key should work. Does that not work?\nWhat is the DB type your are trying to connect?\nEdited: Never mind. I just saw your second message.\n. I have replaced the vanila HTML table with fixed-data-table. I have not published yet because the build on CI is not working properly due http://stackoverflow.com/a/37559463/1050818. In the next release it should present a better performance.\n. Not sure about the performance issues with fixed-data-table. But that is really not actively maintained over the last months. But what I have looked in react-virtualized I could not find support for grid with a header rows. That is why at the end I have used fixed-data-table.\nCould wait until the next release to check if the performance has improved?\n. \ud83d\ude22  Sorry, but I have just replaced the vanilla HTML table with fixed-data-table. I'm not really in the mood right now to rewrite it again with another library. Although a PR would be gladly accepted \ud83d\ude04 \n. Closed on https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/678f7429f6d779cabbb6dcab3eb2f31a3bf90c04\n. @ghedwards that is a great PR \ud83d\udc4f . I just suggested a few changes. I will try it locally later today.\n. @ghedwards. I have tested it locally. Everything seems great but I have found 3 problems:\n1. The table does not fit full window width:\n   \n   At least I think a full width looks better. For instance here is how was looking with fixed-data-table:\n   \n2. There is no column resize and seems react-virtualized has no interesting implementing it into the library https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/issues/128. Well, now we have support to preview the full content of a column in a modal. But I'm not sure that is enough. A column resize would be really great.\n3. When the there is no result is not showing any information. Previously it would show an empty table with row count = 0. \n. I did a quick test. Seems the the table is resizing but is not quite good yet. As you can see the table get full width but with no background of the rows. Which gives the impression is not full width. \n\nBy the way, I hope your wife gets better. As @BornaP said, no rush, take your time.\n. I have tested locally. The resizing looks pretty good. One last thing, the table height does not fit the number of rows. For instance, in case there are few rows it let blank a large part of the table.\nHere is with your code:\n\nHere is as it is in the 1.9.0 version:\n\n. Thanks @ghedwards. I have tested locally and it is looking really good. I have made some suggestions about the code. But don't worry, if you are tired of changing the code I can do them myself on merging the code into the master. Also I'm thinking in tweak a little bit the layout of the table to be a bit more similar with the rest of the application.\n. @ghedwards I have started working in your PR. I'm applying the project code style which is making me to change almost all the code (most of because of spaces, indentations, using vars instead of const and lets, and etc.). So after finishing it will looks like I implemented the feature instead of you. Because git blame will point the last change for me. To not take this feature away from you I am pushing this to a new branch. Then I can squash the commits I made into the yours and keep this way the credit of this feature in your name.\nLet me just make clear. Your code looks really good. Most of the changes are just code style.\nI believe this happened because the linter is not working well on npm run test. I`m going to fix that soon. Also I would suggest you to use the eslint plugin in your text editor. This help a lot during the development.\nI wont be able to finish this today. Saturday I'm totally free for that. Then I can finish it and release a new version in the same day.\n. Cool. I have upgraded the eslint configuration. Now it is working properly. Although, seems there are almost 200 errors to fix. I'm going to fix everything on Saturday. After that running npm test will properly lint the whole project.\n. @ghedwards  Since would be a bit complicated to rebase it in a single commit and would lose a bit of the history. I have just squashed your PR with my changes into the master: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/678f7429f6d779cabbb6dcab3eb2f31a3bf90c04\nPlease take a look in the commits I had to do. I guess there are some suggestions you could take advantage of on developing in React.\nAnyway, thanks a lot!!! \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \n. Sure a channel would be great. I already use Slack daily at my job. Could be Slack? Not sure which one is better.\n. Done https://sqlectron.herokuapp.com\n. Hi @JediMindtrick,\nThanks for the proposed pull request. Although it has already been implemented by @BornaP. If you want to check it out before we release the next version you can run the app from the source.\n. Hi @agodlydeciple,\nThat is weird. Most of the connections I use are over SSH tunnel and that does not happen to me.\n. On typing in the query box the behaviour should be the same independently whether is a local connection or a remote connection through a SSH tunnel. Since it does not happen to me is hard for me trying to fix it. I guess you could avoid this problem by disabling the auto complete, just include \"enabledAutoComplete\": \"false\" on ~/.sqlectron.json.\nAbout to second problem, that does not happen to me either. Although I have include a context menu to refresh the database data. I guess that could sort of solve the problem for you. Is going to be available in the next release.\nSorry. I could not help much.\n. This way:\n\nBut seems it is not working anymore \ud83d\ude22 . I'm investigating that.\n. This feature would aggregate a lot to the app. Although it is something usually I don't really use in a SQL client. Because of that I'm not interesting im coding it my self. But I would gladly accept a PR \ud83d\ude04 \nAs I said I have not used so much this kind of feature in other SLQ clients. So I have some questions:\n1. Does the \"Info\" tab show the information about the columns such as: name, type, if is NULLABLE and etc? I'm asking that because that is what I have seen in other SQL clients. But looking your prototype looks like is listing the table data (all the rows).\n2. Could we have 3 tabs instead of only 2? I guess splitting the 2 boxes of the first tab in different tabs would give a better look. Although if the second box in the first tab is always small than makes sense keep them together.\n. Let me se if I have understood:\n- Tab 1 - Structure: Show the SQL script of the table structure.\n- Tab 2 - Content: Show the table data. With a WHERE filter?\n- Tab 3 - Info: Show information about the table. Such as the size, number of rows, and etc.\nIf the Tab 2 really shows the table data I think that is not gonna work for large tables. Otherwise we would need paginate the result to not causa a memory leak. But I prefer keep it simple and do not have this tab. Because is possible to use \"select rows (with limit)\" to achieve almost the same thing.\n. Well, that is a lot of stuff \ud83d\ude04  Maybe starting with a single tab (the one that is more useful for you) I guess would be better.\n. Good job @BornaP. The diagram looks really great \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f .\nI am just confused about the user be able to manipulate links between tables. Since it is a diagram that does not apply change to database. Does make sense the user be able to do that?\nBy the way, since I have got the build working. I was planning in release a new version tomorrow. Do you think it is something we can include in the next release or should we wait for the following one?\n. What OS are you using? I saw this problem occurring in a Linux today. But that have not happened to me at anytime during the tests on Mac. \n. @eMerzh I could reproduce following your steps. I will try take a look on this.\n. I have tested with this change and looks good.\n. Looks all good.\n. Is not related to this PR. But I think it would looks better if this modal had a header :)\n. I guess just \"Diagram\" is enough.\n. @sombriks @vikas-0 could you check this works for you? https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/tag/v1.10.0\nBut I guess the release for RPM is not quite \"stable\" yet https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/502.\n. Closing it since I have not received any response. Please reopen it in case that does not work.\n. @sombriks no worries. That problem should be fixed in the latest version. Could you try that out?\nThanks\n. Another indeed good feature. Thanks @BornaP \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \n. Seems it is a problem in the node DB clients. I have tested on mysql and postgres and the problem occurs in both.\nI am including here a screenshot of the problem then is easier to show the problem in the issues am going to open the in DB clients.\n\n. The solution for this problem is referenced in those issues. I have not really much time to implement that right now. So, anyone interested on that, please do.\n. I have heard few people complain about this problem. Which made them waste few hours because didn't realize the column was duplicated. They gave me an idea of a workaround solution for this problem. While we are not able to prevent the duplicated columns in the result. We could at least show a warning message when there are duplicated columns in the result. At least the user know right away he should use an alias to avoid this problem. I will try give some priority to add this warning.. @ghedwards thanks for the PR. Looks good \ud83d\ude04 \nI have just suggested some changes. But I will ask you to also check the linter. I have upgraded the linter configuration on the weekend. Maybe is missing run npm i for you. I have included the linter in the CI as well. So, now is possible to check through the CI (https://travis-ci.org/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/jobs/138833579#L482). Although I recommend using the linter in your text editor or at least running npm t before pushing a commit.\n. Hey @ghedwards, how is it going? Do you need any help to complete the linter changes?\n. Hi @ghedwards. I took a look in your PR today. I have noticed the alignment is a bit wrong as you can see in the screenshot.\n\nYou are passing the width of the sidebar to the inner elements. But since there are many elements with padding and margin in the tree, the sidebar width is larger then the inner element width. I tried calculating the whole margin and padding involved, but that didn't work quite well. Maybe a better solution is reading from the DOM the wrapper element width after the component did mount.\n. I will close this PR since it is very outdated.. We do not list the sequences. Although I would gladly accept a PR for that \ud83d\ude04 \n. Awesome. Exactly, would require changing the core and the gui projects.\n. I guess all that could be included in the sqlectron eventually. But I think is better include one item per time. Small tasks have more chance to be completed than larger tasks. Also I believe including the items as we need them somehow will keep the app simpler to use. Since there are only useful features.\n. I don't think other apps has this option. But if anyone is interested on implementing it I would gladly accept a pull request.\n. It is duplicated https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/168. Closing it in favor of the other issue.\nI don't have much time to implement it now. I hope do this in the future. But if anyone is interested in implementing it earlier I would gladly accept a pull request \ud83d\ude04 \n. Closing it, since this has been fixed by @plandevida on #205.\n. Hi @plandevida, thanks for the PR. I'm going to test it this weekend.\n. Thanks @kas :)\n. Could you give an example of that? For me the error messages are pretty helpful:\n\n. This works. Is just not possible to execute from inside the query box.\n. That is weird. Opening the link directly works. I could not find the reason that is occurring there. Well, is time to upgrade the demo gif. I will wait for that to fix the preview.\n. Could you provide the error message?\n. Ok, only that is enough. The app does not have any log file.\nThe library we use node-mmsql has a domain property in the connection for what you need. But we have no included that.\nSince I don't use mmsql this feature is low priority for me. Not sure when I will be able to implement it. If you are interested in implementing it I could show to you the places you have to change and I would gladly accept a PR for that.\n. @jaykilleen thanks. I appreciate the feedback :)\nEven changing the .sqlectron.json manually it would no work because sqlectron-core would not include this property in the connection configuration.\nAbout your issue, this is what node-mmsql describes about the domain:\n\ndomain - Once you set domain, driver will connect to SQL Server using domain login.\n\nIf it helps you, here is an example how probably the connection string would look like with the domain.\nhttps://github.com/patriksimek/node-mssql/blob/12255523f892d72d440f06d1ee86a2b214961db1/test/unit/unit.coffee#L39\nThis week I am working a bit in some features. So I don't mind including this domain property in the connection options. But I don't have any domain to test it. It would be a shot in the dark.\n. This would be really good. Actually it has been requested already https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/issues/26. @AngeloR was working on that. But I am not sure he had any progress on that.\nIf you are interested on implementing it I would gladly accept a PR. Otherwise I probably will implement it in the future. I just don't know when :smile: \n. Done on https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/tag/v1.19.0. You may have not noticed but there is link to the shortcut list in the app.\n\nAnyway, you are right. I have included that in the readme as well. Thanks.\n. That is weird. Lets try to understand what is going on: \n- Are you executing a select statement? \n- Are you executing a single statement or multiple statements?\n- Does executing it on another sql client gives a different result?\nIf you could provide the sql statement you are using or a modified version of that would help.\n. Sorry, I really don't know what is going on. It is working for me on Ubuntu 16.04; Sqlectron 1.12; Postgres;\nHere is a similar query:\n\n. That is really weird. I don't see how that could happen. Nowadays there is no easy way to debug the app in the release version. You probably would need to run the app from the source and include some logs manually to see what is going on. If you are interested on doing that and need help on how to do that, just let me know.\n. Are you sure it is not working? This feature is already included in the app.\n. I guess it should work, since the tab always uses the same connection. But since I have never tested it out, I will need check it better.\n. Is it occurring with which version? If it is occurring on 1.13.0, could you check if it works with the previous version 1.12.0?\n. I have tested today the latest version on windows 10 64bit. That is working. Are you using a 32bit OS? Currently we only have support on Windows for 64bit.\n. I have no Surface to test. I have opened an issue in the installer library to check if there is a way to fix that.\n. Sure, that is better.\n. When this issue was created I tried investigating what could be causing this problem on Windows.\nBy the this response on electron-builder (tool used to generate the installers). Seems it is not a problem. Actually it is the common behaviour for Windows installation using Squirrel.Windows.\nSo, apparently we would need to add the handling of squirrel events and create and delete the shortcuts based on those events. Here is an example.\nI am not a Windows user anymore. So it is a bit complicated to test it. If anyone is interested in fixing it I would gladly accept a pull request. Otherwise may take a while until I try to fix this.\n. Ouch \"pretty much unusable\" :cry: Even without that feature I think this app still quite useful. At least I have never needed to do that using this app or even with any other client. But I get your point, that would be a great feature.\nI have seen some people doing that manually, listing the queries running in the database and killing them. I guess that is something you can do in any database. Could you let me know which client you use has this feature?\nSince that is something I have never needed to use. I wont try to implement it right now. But if you are interested in sending a PR I would gladly accept that.\n. Fair enough. I have investigated the implementation for this feature and seems only mysql is gonna a bit more complicated.\n- postgres client has support already to cancel the query. reference\n- mysql does not have support, would require finding the current process id and killing it reference\n- mssql client has support already to cancel the query. reference\n- cassandra does not have support, and I think is not even possible to do that trick to kill the process (I am ok skipping this feature for this client)\nSince it is a important feature I don't mind implement it. But right now I'm not much available to implement that. @elhh82 if you are interested on implementing that, please do.\n. Sure. That looks good. Thanks @eMerzh \n. I guess we could achieve that by adding support to save the current window state to a folder. Each tab would become a different file. So adding support to open queries from a folder would kind of restore the window state.\n. Right click over a table in the sidebar shows a context menu with an option Create Statement. Is that what you need?\n. I guess that name was copied from MySQL Workbench. Any better suggestion?\nBy this definition of DDL for Create Table Statement looks like we have got all the requirements:\n\nCREATE TABLE statement\nA commonly used CREATE command is the CREATE TABLE command. The typical usage is:\nsql\nCREATE TABLE [table name] ( [column definitions] ) [table parameters]\nThe column definitions are:\n- A comma-separated list consisting of any of the following\n- Column definition: [column name] [data type] {NULL | NOT NULL} {column options}\n- Primary key definition: PRIMARY KEY ( [comma separated column list] )\n- Constraints: {CONSTRAINT} [constraint definition]\n- RDBMS specific functionality\n\nFor example, this is what I got from one of my tables on MySQL:\nsql\nCREATE TABLE `client` (\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  `realm_id` int(11) NOT NULL,\n  `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL,\n  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,\n  `secret` char(32) NOT NULL,\n  `createdAt` datetime NOT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),\n  KEY `fk_client_user1_idx` (`user_id`),\n  KEY `fk_client_realm1_idx` (`realm_id`),\n  CONSTRAINT `fk_client_realm1` FOREIGN KEY (`realm_id`) REFERENCES `realm` (`id`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION,\n  CONSTRAINT `fk_client_user1` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `user` (`id`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION\n) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=18 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n. Thanks @jmealo for the details. Anyone interested on improving that please do. Here is the code we use nowadays to build the \"Create Script\": https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/db/clients/postgresql.js#L273\n. Hi @bryantmakesprog,\nBefore running the project you have to install the dependencies.\nbash\nnpm install\n. Could you try to run the app to check if it may work without those skipped deps?\nIf still not working. Could you let me know what OS you are using. And also the NPM version your are using (npm --version).\n. Well should work with your environment configuration. Sometime NPM mess up the installation, if something goes wrong like network failure. Could you try removing the node_modules and installing again?\n. I have realized it before too. It occurs sometimes :cry: \n. https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/commit/70a4a6d9038abadace5bd1ce4d4b91b07259e15c close it.\n. I added support for this on https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/releases/tag/v7.1.0.\nBut still have to change the GUI to work properly. I'm a bit tired to implement it right now. So if anyone is interested in helping with that let me know and I can give some ideas of how to do it.\n. I remember we had that code before. But I removed in some refactoring I guess because looked like it was not really applying any change. I hope it was there because of this problem \ud83d\ude04 \n. Looks good with the power off icon. \ud83d\udc4f  Regarding the reconnect button. I have added that button because sometimes I lost the connection and the client didn't send any event about that. So it would get stuck and I would need to leave and connect again. Which would make lose the current tabs. That is way I have added that button. If we could detect better the lost connections that would be really better. But I am not sure is something so reliable. I guess MySQL has a button like that as well visible even if your connection is ok.\n. I usually work at same time in different databases. So, have the database type somewhere easy to see is really helpful.\nIn the beginning of the project I tried this approach (server name + db type icon) in the sidebar header. But I didn't like much how that looked. At the time we were not handling well long text in the sidebar. But nowadays looks good:\n\nAlthough another problem still present. The icon for MySQL is not transparent. So, looks pretty ugly in a non white background.\n\n\nPG and Cassandra the icon looks good. MSSQL I have not tested.\n\nI would gladly accept this PR once we have a better icon for MySQL. If is not possible to find a better icon. Maybe you could try a different approach such as moving the database type to the top header (Although maybe the icon will be too small and will look ugly as well :(, not sure).\n. Would be good to see how it looks in that background :)\nOn Sun, Sep 25, 2016, 10:29 AM eMerzh notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@maxcnunes https://github.com/maxcnunes , what do you think about this\none https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MySQL.svg\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/241#issuecomment-249421953,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAphpFaWK6wGX7GfSNcUeYBNj2bmzbe8ks5qtndEgaJpZM4KFvfK\n.\n. Sorry, I could not understand well what is going on. Could you include some schreenshots?\n. Ok. But that is weird because it is working for me. Clicking twice over a database name or once over the arrow should connect to that database (if it is not connected yet) and toggle its metadata information (tables, views and etc.). I'm testing it on Linux right now. Only if it is a problem on Windows. But we have not changed anything related to that in the last releases. So should still working on Windows.\n. I will download a vm with Windows and check it out.\n. @adifaidz I have tested on Windows 10 and it is working properly. I guess I have seen this problem before when the user didn't have permissions to the tables of the database. Could you check if that is not your case?\n. Is your connection localhost or is it running in other machine?\nIf it is in other server you should need something like this:\n\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION\nBut if you are able to connect with those grants I guess your DB is in the localhost.\nI'm running out of ideas. Could you check if the there is some message in the console tab on the Developer tools?\n. @adifaidz  Is weird that with the information_schema database you are able at least to toggle the database. But with the previous databases you weren't.\n. Pretty good. Thanks @eMerzh!!!\n. Without the nav buttons it looks good. But how does it look when the right button is visible?\n. yeah, looks a bit weird. Maybe if the were like a composed button (without the radius border between them) would look better.\n. I will accept the PR as it is and try to make it looks better. Thanks @eMerzh \n. The main idea for this project is to be a simple DB client. Although many new features I didn't initially think on adding to the project have being add gradually. I won't implement it by myself, because I don't really miss this kind of feature. But a PR is welcome \ud83d\ude04 \n. The only problem I see nowadays is that is not possible to cancel a on going query. So with a infinity timeout you could get stuck in a really long query. But since we have plans to add support at some point to cancel the query #221. I guess changing the timeout to infinity already is not a problem.\n. I guess this was discussed before in some old issue. My only concern using a single click is that the user open a new connection without really want to do that. By clicking by mistake over the database name. But if it is the way other sql client does that I'm ok to go with this solution.\n. Yeah. Is that issue I was talking about. Then was decided we were going to use the same way the Workbench does. https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/133#issuecomment-217306706 Which is the way is working nowadays \ud83d\ude04 \nBut if the way is nowadays is really complicated to use I agree to discuss a new approach. I just would like to avoid the user opening a new connection by mistake. With remote connections on a slow network it can be a bit frustrating. Maybe including the icon can work. We just have to be careful to not put too much stuff in the interface. Maybe the icon be visible only on hover the database could work as well (but could be not so intuitive).\n. Sorry, I could not imagine how the interface would look like with your description :laughing: \nI like the left sidebar with all dbs because it give fast access to all available dbs. Seems would be more complicated to work with different dbs at same time without that. But if you have a propose for a new interface that would improve the UX I'm open to discussion. Although, it looks a bit low priority based in other issues we have.\n. I have add the preload filter support on v1.19.0 and background database in some previous version:\n\ntransparent: not connected DBs\nblue: connected DBs\nyellow: current connected DB which the current query tab is related with\n\nWith those features. Does it issue still something we want to do? Or can I close it?. @krainboltgreene it is really nice to hear you are interested in contributing to the project. The idea of replacing the tabs with list seems a good approach. At least with small queries and table results it looks could work really well. Although with the opposite I'm not sure about that. Seems would be even worse because you could not see all the open \"tabs\" without scrolling the whole page.\nSo before writing a PR for this I guess we could discuss more about it. Sure we can find a good approach for this problem. At least once we add support to rename tabs the user will be able to set the best name for each one of them. So this could already improve a lot the problem with the tab names.\n. I have just tested on v1.15 a connection without password and it worked the test and connect buttons.\n\n\nIf either buttons were not working I would say was a configuration problem. But if it works the test but does not work the connect I have no idea what could be the problem. Does it show an error message?\n. I have never used FDWs before. So I have not interest on implementing it by myself. But if someone else is interested on that I am open to discuss about it.\n. @eMerzh has added schema support for good part of the app. But we have not released those changes yet. @eMerzh do you know if your changes solve this problem?\n. I got this month to close some issues. This one is in my todo list.. @eMerzh Thanks for the PR!! I have just merged it through another PR.. That is something we have not implemented yet. But seems it is an important feature for the app. If you are interested on implementing it please send a PR. Otherwise I can do that once I have more free time available.\n. A tip to implement this is follow the same approach of the one used by the ssh passphrase:\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=CONNECTION_REQUIRE_SSH_PASSPHRASE. @synle Since some databases don't have a password. Would be pretty annoying prompting for password for any empty passwords.\nI would suggest adding a checkbox \"Prompt for the password during the initial connection\" in the server info. If a user has that checkbox checked then the password in the server info would be disabled and he would be prompted during the initial connection (we would need to keep the password in memory to open connection with different databases in the same server connection).\nFollowing the tip I gave previously (CONNECTION_REQUIRE_SSH_PASSPHRASE) should guide you in the right implementation.. Probably it is showing the raw structure type. I guess the data field contains the bit value.\n. @enVolt I guess nobody is looking into that. Would you like to fix that? I'm almost sure the place to fix that is here https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/src/renderer/utils/convert.js#L19.. I'm glad you liked the app :)\nThis issue was discussed before here https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/133.\nThen everybody agreed we would follow this behaviour https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/133#issuecomment-217306706.\nBut some time ago @eMerzh sent a PR to change it https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/250. And again we decided to keep as it is nowadays.\nDoes that make sense or do you think we could improve that?\n. I have just remembered I am changing the way the connections work due https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/238 and https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/224. After those changes, opening the database actually will not keep a connection open but instead will create a pool of connections. Using a pool of connection is better because the pool kills the idle connections automatically. So open a database will be less harmful than it is nowadays which creates a new connection and keep that open while the server connection in the app is not closed.\nSo I guess after those changes we could apply your feature request.\n. Well the concept behind the sidebar is list all available dbs for the connected server. With the current app what you could do is filter by the db name. This should improve the performance and let you focus your current working database. At least I'm used to do that.\n. Sorry, I thought that would improve the performance. Actually there is a PR to improve the performance in the sidebar for large list of databases https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/200. But that PR had some UI problems and has never been merged.\nIn my case I work a lot with micro services. So in my daily job I usually have to access many DBs from the same server at same time. A list with all DBs available helps a lot. Because once I'm connected to the server I have easy access to all other DBs. But if that does not work for you. Maybe we could include a checkbox somewhere to allow show only the DB specified in the server connection.\n. @krainboltgreene  I have added support to configure a preload filter for database and schema in https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/tag/v1.19.0. You have to configure it manually for while in the .sqlectron.json. With that configuration you will be able to load only the database/schema which are useful for you and by that improve the usability on large servers like Heroku.. Nowadays when you connect to a server, you connect to a specific database. Once you are connected to that server then you are able to connect to the other databases in that server. The tables for each database are only fetched once you connect to that database. If the database your are connecting has a really large number of tables than it can really be a performance problem. Could you confirm how many tables it has? There is a PR https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/200 to improve the performance in the sidebar. But it has never been finished :(\n. Actually it logs to a single DB. It only shows the other databases available in the sidebar. But you are not connected to them. I have changed in the last version to use different database color background:\n- transparent: not connected DBs\n- blue: connected DBs\n- yellow: current connected DB which the current query tab is related with\nSeems this issue is a bit related to this one https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/262\n. Is this problem similar to this one? https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/242\n. @joshferrell I have added support to configure a preload filter for database and schema on https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/tag/v1.19.0. You have to configure it manually for while in the .sqlectron.json. That configuration should avoid this problem since you will be able to load only the database/schema that are useful for you.. @blakek, I don't believe that issue is related to this one. Could you open it a new issue? I have some comments about it. But would like to keep it organized in the new issue. Thanks.. Really? That should work just as fine as the other clients. Probably the error message shows IP instead of the domain because once the DNS server resolve the domain name it uses the IP to connect. Are the mysql and phpmyadmin clients running in the same machine of the sqlectron? Are you sure your mysql server is running in your host machine?\n. We pass ahead the hostname exactly as it was typed in the form to the mysql driver https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql. So it should accept any hostname. \nMaybe is not possible to connect to a Maria DB through the Mysql support. Then would require using the proper maria db driver for that https://github.com/mscdex/node-mariasql. \nI will try test it later.\nBut I am curious how you are able to connect with the hostname localhost and is not able to connect with the hostname 127.0.0.1. Since the localhost name will be resolved to 127.0.0.1 by the DNS server. Could you please check if your localhost is really resolving to 127.0.0.1 with:\nping localhost\n. @blackPantherOS are you using ssh tunnel? I just realized we use a fixed host for ssh tunnel https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/utils.js#L68. It may could be the reason for your problem.\n. Yeah that is weird. I will try to check it out once I have some free time. Thanks for reporting the issue.\n. I thought I would have time to investigate it. But I don't :( If someone else has interest in doing that. Please do.\n. Yes. That would be great. Please go for it. Let me know if you need any help.\n. Hi @bjhansen-ualr, thanks for report the problem. My fault, I will fix that once I get some free time.\n. Was included the application_name in the postgres connection. So it is easier to find out a process running on PG from sqlectron. I had not realized it was not available in previous versions. I will change the code to use that property only in the versions with support for that.\n. Ok. I will try fix that this weekend.. Fixed the problem with the application_name. New release available https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases/tag/v1.18.0.. Probably your public schema is empty. And you are trying to access a db/table from a different schema. Unfortunately we do not support different schemas yet. Although there is a PR open to solve part of this problem. What you can do for now to at least be able to execute the query I guess is change the current schema inside the query http://stackoverflow.com/a/25014153/1050818.. I just realized that will not work :( Because each statement is executed separated. So the second statement will be executed with the default schema.\nI will try this week to merge this PR, so is possible to define the default schema https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/257.. Thanks @vmitchell85 . Although I think it is a very interesting and useful feature.We will not be able to implement that. Because we would need to have an AST for SQL and this should work as well for every DB we have support. So we would know for sure where the current query start and finish. Nowadays there isn't a library that has support for that. And implementing that ourselves would take a long time.\nSo unfortunately executing the query of the current selector position is not possible. But at least you can execute the current selected query.. I was thinking about it and maybe this could be achievable if we improve https://github.com/maxcnunes/sql-query-identifier to also return the query related to the type. So we would know what is the query the current selector is over.. Anyone interested in this feature. Please tests your queries (simple and complex) here and let me know if there is any bug. If after sometime that is considered stable. Then we can use that to achieve this feature.. Nowadays is  only possible to increase the size of the fonts inside the query box. Any other kind of zoom is not available yet. But looking into the electron API seems it is simple to achieve https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-frame.md#webframe.\nI can't work on that. But I would glad help if you are interested in do a PR for that.. To use a different zoom factor. Include this configuration on your ~/.sqlectron.json:\njson\n\"zoomFactor\": 2,\nPS: Still have to wait a new release to use this setting.. The app already has initial support for that. Every executed query is stored in memory. I had implemented that thinking in finishing this in the future. But I never got the time to finish that.\nHere is the code where the query is stored after been executed: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/src/renderer/reducers/queries.js#L60\nI thought it could have like a select element that would allow select any previous query executed for that tab in the current session. Is that what you were thinking?. I think that button would be even better if the user could filter by past queries for only the current tab as well. So the user have access to all queries in that session. But if he want to see only the queries for that current tab he is able to filter that. Could be a different button or just a check show only queries of current tab.. I guess we could just remove the short key for the window reload. That is more used in development environment at least. I'm ok using that for run the query as well. A PR for that would be awesome :). @blakek Thanks for the PR. I will try to test that as soon I get a free time. @eMerzh If you have tested that already feel free to merge that.. But the problem is also here https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/validators/server.js#L63.\nWould need to change those two places. Maybe we should increase the size for the other fields as well. Or maybe even remove the limit.. Hi @btmurrell,\nFirst of all. I'm glad you like the app.\nIt is the first time someone issue a problem related to proxies.\nMy first solution would be the HTTP_PROXY env variable. But you have already tried that without success. Just checking, have you done some like this? \n(OSX)\nexport HTTP_PROXY=http://user:pass@server.url:port\ncd /Applications/Sqlectron.app\nopen .\nWhat makes this problem more confuse is that the connections does not use HTTP protocol for communications. So I am not even sure that HTTP_PROXY would really work at all.\nThe solutions (or not) I have found for each db:\n\nmysql - Seems is possible. But need to create a socket to the proxy.\npg - Someone tried the same solution from mysql. But seems that didn't worked for him.\nmssql - Seems is not possible. And has no support for linux socket.\n\nI unfortunately don't have a proxy to test that.. Do you mean debugger from the browser? You will not have access to that code through the browser. Because that is a nodejs code (backend). The code you have access through the browser is just the frontend. There are some ways to allow debug on nodejs. But I have never used that. My debug is console.log \ud83d\ude06 . Just to ensure. The code you probably gonna need to debug is:\n\nrunWithConnection - node_modules/sqlectron-core/lib/db/clients/postgresql.js\n\nIf you are using ssh. You may have to debug this one as well:\n node_modules/sqlectron-core/lib/db/tunnel.js. Fixed the problem on saving the passphrase checkbox.\nThe problem in the connection I need a bit more time to investigate that since I need to prepare a VM to test that.. Could you check if with the password saved is possible to connect?. I could reproduce the error. I will try get this fixed in the weekend.. These are the problem\nconfigure.js?1008:27  action @ 14:13:00.832 FETCH_TABLES_FAILURE\nconfigure.js?1008:27  action @ 14:13:00.840 FETCH_VIEWS_FAILURE\nconfigure.js?1008:27  action @ 14:13:00.846 FETCH_ROUTINES_FAILURE\nCould you send the ~/.sqlectron.log? Or at least open those _FAILURE messages:\n\n. Sorry, I said ~/.sqlectron.json but I meant ~/.sqlectron.log \ud83d\ude06 . You need to enable the logging to file in your ~/.sqlectron.json\njs\n  \"log\": {\n    \"console\": true,\n    \"file\": true,\n    \"level\": \"debug\"\n  },\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/app/logging.md. @tyx Releasing a fix for that. Let me know if that solves your problem.. Looks like it is related to https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/129. What is your OS? I don't see this happening on MacOS.. I thought maybe was because of the copy and past. But I still can't reproduce that. Maybe there is some especial character in that file that is causing it.\nDoes the problem occur if you past this query below?\nsql\nSELECT some_column\nFROM some_table\nWHERE some_table.other_column = 'some_value';. So that is probably the reason. There is an issue open for that already https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/286.\nI will close it since it looks is duplicated. Let me know if it still happening after that issue is solved.. @terrywh If you include a limit of 100 for that table, does it still freezing? If it still freezing than is not directly related to #129. But could be related to #174, although in this case is text/blob instead of JSON. The LEFT (for mssql, other clients use different keyword) command could definitely help. This looks a good and easy solution. But I would prefer to see this in a different menu item instead of including it in the \"Select rows (with limit)\". Could be \"Select rows (with limit and fixed column size)\". So would allow the users choose what works better for them.\nRight now I'm focusing in make the app more stable fixing the more critical bugs. Although this can cause the app to freeze. It still can be avoided by adding the LEFT keyword manually. So it is something I don't intend to implement myself so soon. If you have interest in sending a PR for that. Please do, I can help with any development question.. I have tested it and is working in my case. In your case although is not showing any error message I believe the load tables is failing. I will add an option to enable debug which will forward all the logs to file. With that we can understand why that is failing. . @blakek or @augustowebd could you download the laster version and send me the log file? https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/app/logging.md\nIMPORTANT: Replace any secret info may have in the logs (e.g. password).. Close due other implementation without requiring global shortcuts https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/289\nThanks @krolow!. @krolow could you check if it works for you? At least on mac it is working for me.. You need to pass a database. If you want to use a in memory database is required to set the database as :memory:. Maybe we could do that the default database.. But most of the time you would want to use a local database. Otherwise any change would be lost. For that you just need to pass the path to your database file in the database field.. Sorry. I have fixed that already here https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/282#issuecomment-273150382. I will release a new version with that fix later today.. Fixed on     698230f. Could be this problem maybe? https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2/issues/422. Could you please open a new issue for that and maybe include the log as well? https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/app/logging.md\nClosing it since the original problem has been solved.. @eqxDev I have solved the other bug you have found as well. (fixed with 8dbfac4)\nBtw, I also got the Encoding too long when I was using a wrong passphrase.. Probably is something I have changed lately. A workaround for that for now:\necho '{ \"servers\": [] }' > ~/.sqlectron.json. We already use https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized which should solve the rendering problem. Maybe upgrading to a new version could improve a bit the performance.\nI think this part of the code takes a long time to execute https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/49e21224445936625d1e4719a051f778cda541bc/src/renderer/actions/queries.js#L181.\nBut that is a workaround we need to do. Otherwise it cause a lot of problems managing the state with react. One way to avoid that would be moving away from IPC calls and use HTTP calls. Is a bit related with this other issue https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/129#issuecomment-221227411. But is something would require a lot of work. And I don't plan doing that (at least not so soon). Unfortunately I have to say the easiest thing to do now is use limit \ud83d\ude22 . It is working on Mac. Anyone interested on fixing that on Windows please send a PR :). This improvement has been requested before. Here is my answer for that :) https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/246#issuecomment-251527628\nAbout MariaDB. It should work already by using MySQL client.. Where is looking like that? Could you please include a screen shot?. Thanks. I will try fix that.. @dlion Has added support for saving the result into CSV and JSON files. It still missing the option to choose the CSV separator. If anyone is interested to work on that, it could be set in the settings modal. Wouldn't be so flexible, but would already be very helpful.. Hi. Is possible to disable the whole auto complete with enabledAutoComplete or just the live auto complete with enabledLiveAutoComplete. https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/app/configuration-file.md. Since in SQLite the database is the file itself. You have to set the file\npath in \"Database\" field.\nBut I agree the UI could be improved. Is the second time I see this\nconfusion.\nOn Wed, Mar 1, 2017, 6:30 AM Paul Ph\u00f6nixwei\u00df notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nsqlectron-gui\n1.20.2 (1.20.2.439)\nOS X 10.11.6 (15G1217)\nI can't find any possible way to select a local sqlite database stored as\nfile on the local machine.\n[image: db file]\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3630353/23453627/1ff06fba-fe7a-11e6-862a-3ade07c380fd.png\nThe only settings possible to define are: Name, Dtabase Type and\nDatabase/Keyspace field\n[image: settings window]\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3630353/23453677/53bcd680-fe7a-11e6-9380-cd64d2db4f8f.png\nMaybe it is not an issue in general but a lack of UI logic to handle such\ncommon user task.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/303, or mute the\nthread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAphpD2_s5oXrGerzPIJPbYqT5c3zg6bks5rhTrCgaJpZM4MPaTi\n.\n. Closing it since you cannot reproduce it anymore. Also, there is an issue related with the fourth tab that has just been fixed. Maybe it was related to this one.. What exactly do you mean by becomes unusable?\n The list of tables is too huge and take over the whole sidebar?\n The app become too slow to use?\n Only the scroll in the sidebar is too slow to use?. What is the OS you are using?. Could you attach the logging for that? https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/app/logging.md. @nirmaljpatel Could you remove the path from configuration path? By default should use that path. I believe the app is not been able to resolve ~/. Or set an absolute path.. Humm that is bad. I will try take a look on that soon. @tengis thanks for the investigation.. Thanks @s-kem for taking care of this issue!!. If someone is interested on implementing this. Here is the steps in a high level:\n1. Duplicate the postgres client - https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/db/clients/postgresql.js\n1. Include the new client in the list of supported dbs - https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/db/clients/index.js\n1. Ensure the tests are passing - https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/spec/db.spec.js\n1. Link sqlectron-core to sqlectron-gui and test it in the app - https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/development/test-core-changes.md\n1. Include a logo - server-db-client-<client_name>.png https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/tree/master/src/renderer/components. If schema is not supported by the database you can just ignore that value.. * To run the app from the source https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/development/run-from-source.md\n To rebuild the app automatically on changing the code from sqlectron-core https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/development/test-core-changes.md. Query does not have support for query().execute(). It should use executeQuery instead. I will fix it once I have a free time.. Looks like some css problem related to fonts. Should be simple to inspect that with devtools and change it to find a better appearance. I would appreciate if someone with Linux could check it out.. @hobarrera and @santaclauze The schema field in the server information window is only the schema used for the initial connection. But you still able to access the other available schemas. If you want to filter schemas or databases listed in the sidebar then you need to define that manually in the ~/.sqlectron.json configuration (I have not included that in the server information window yet) with the filter property https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/app/configuration-file.md.. We don't have plans for making the default schema the only available in the connection. But we could have like a checkbox in the server information window to make that possible. On selecting that checkbox it would automatically set that filter property.\n\nAbout the xdg standard there is a separated issue for that sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/327. The trick thing about the multiple database types support is that when we need to add a new feature or changing an app behavior, you have to take in consideration all the other database clients. Some times, we need to keep the UI or even internal implementation simpler so it can have a better consistency over all databases clients.\nThat said, I guess we didn't grouped by schemas because not all dbs have schema support. So keeping schemas in the same level with tables was the best approach to ensure UI and internal implementation consistency over all dbs.\nBut I'm not against this feature if grouping the tables or schemas would really improve the UX. I just don't want to spend time in this feature since the current implementation is working fine for me :) If anyone else is interested to work on that I could help with any development questions.. Closing it since now is possible to group schemas and the connection label for database and schemas is a bit more clear they are the initial one used in the connection. Thanks everybody for contributing!!. The CLI has not been maintained for a long time. So, I wouldn't care about that. At least, seems it is easier to use the existing configuration file instead of handling another one.\nBut at the same time, that kind of transient data could grow really fast. So for that reason would be better keep it in a separated file.\nYeah, that kind of postponing would be important to not cause performance issues.. I believe we can start with the simplest solution by saving into the sqlectron.json. If later we find out any performance issues related to that then we can improve it by splitting it up. . Does the autocomplete still appearing for you? It shouldn't.\nDo you need access all schemas or tables available? You could filter them with filter configuration (also described here).. For me on Mac it is working. Please could someone with Ubuntu check it out?. @clayzermk1 We just use a simple HTML file input. It should work normally in any OS. Try opening the devtools to see if there is some error in the console.. In the next version the secret values (passwords) in ~/.sqlectron.json will be encrypted. The SQLECTRON_SECRET is the secret used to encrypt and decrypt the passwords. But replace-secret.js is only executed in the build. You shouldn't have that problem with npm run dev.. Although that problem wasn't happening to me. I have simplified the code to not depend on SQLECTRON_SECRET anymore. Closing this issue. Please re open if it still happening to you.. We use node-mmsql client. If that supports it and someone is interested on implementing that a PR is welcome.. I have ran the core tests with PG 8.4.22 and many tests failed. That means sqlectron right now does not support PG < 9. I can't work on adding support for that. But I will accept a PR from anyone interested on doing that.. @eMerzh Good addition. I didn't remember checking out the supported versions. In that case would be only worth including support on sqlectron if it is a simple change. Otherwise would cause more bad than good.. Thanks @jleclanche for all the effort in this issue! I will publish later today a new version with your fixing. I'm just not sure this will be enough to consider the app supports PG 8.x. At least in the local test I had ran with 8.x seemed there was a lot of tests failing with PG 8.x such as generating scripts (select, create, and etc.) and canceling a running querying (I don't really remember which tests were). But if this small fixing already help you out in what you need that is awesome.. Thats @WFrsh. It is great now!. Please anyone with Windows take a look on this. No. Just that one.. Weird. This seems similar to this other issue https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/220. Could you confirm if it isn't the same problem? I don't think there are logs available during the installation process. We could try add other installation targets for windows to workaround this problem too https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#WinBuildOptions-target. Since we already have many users with their configuration at $HOME/.sqlectron.json. I believe it should follow this approach:\n1. Check if there is $HOME/.sqlectron.json\n1.1. Yes - Load config from there.\n1.2. No - Check if there is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sqlectron/config.json\n1.2.1. Yes - Load config from there.\n1.2.2. No - Create a config there and load config from there.. Does that happen for what DB client? Does that happen for the first window as well? Could you provide the logs for that error?. So lets close it for now. Please reopen it if you can reproduce again later.. Sorry, I didn't see this issue before. Nowadays it isn't possible. But shouldn't be too complicated to make it configurable. Although I'm fine with the current font so I won't spend time on this. But I could help you out guiding you on making those changes.. It used to work. I don't have much time to work on this. But if anyone needs help debugging and fixing this please let me know.. Hi @fire, these are the steps to add a new client https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-client.\nWe don't use jdbc yet. All the existing clients have their own client driver. But I guess should still be very similar to them.\nProbably this Snappydata will end up being very similar to the Cassandra client. Since that wasn't a SQL database (although supports SQL queries) it was required to disable some features: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/db/clients/index.js#L58. Please take a look in Cassandra example. It has the minimal implementation possible: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/db/clients/cassandra.js \nSearch for dbClient === 'cassandra' in https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/spec/db.spec.js to see how is handled the test for that client.\nOf course would be even better if the database support and you could provide more than the minimal \ud83d\ude04 . That is weird. A port is required for any connection. Are we using the wrong default port for Microsoft SQL DB?. You should need just enable the ssl option:\n\n. Custom ssl certificates are not supported right now. Would require change the app to include a new input file to select ssl files and pass that ahead to mysql client config https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/db/clients/mysql.js#L372.\nShouldn't be so complicated to implement but that is something I don't use and wouldn't be worth for me spending time on this. Although I would gladly accept a PR for that \ud83d\ude04 . I don't know, the one we are currently using seems to have a better support and more features. We could add though an option to export to nomnoml too if that is really useful.. Have you tried zoomFactorsetting?\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/app/configuration-file.md. Please what is the: OS, Sqlectron version and DB you are using?. But which database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, ...?\nOn Sun, Aug 27, 2017, 10:03 AM xkoenig notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nMac OS 10.12.6; sqlectron version 1.23.0.

Sorry, I can't reproduce this issue. Probably you will need to debug it in the source code or wait for someone else to do that.. Although this really is a simple JOIN, the amount of data retrieved there is huge. So, I don't think is a problem with the JOIN query itself but the amount of data returned there. To make it clear, could you try to run with a limit:\nsql\nselect i.i_id from item i,order_line o\nwhere o.ol_i_id=i.i_id\nlimit 100\nBtw, we already have an issue open for querying thousand of records: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/129. @msopko81 Does it still happening for you? I get this in the latest version:\ncsv\nFIRST,SECOND,LAST\n2017-09-18 00:00:00,2017-09-18 00:00:00,2017-09-18 00:00:00. Hmm, I didn't notice you were using MSSQL. I have tested with PostgreSQL only. Sorry, I don't have an MSSQL to test it out.. Hi @itaispector,\n\nWe appreciate the feedback :)\nThat feature has been requested a few times already.\nHere is the last open issue for that: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/297\nClosing this one since it is duplicated.. The main idea was to keep the app simple allowing a user with multiple database types to work over those different databases with simple tasks such as CRUD actions in the same application. \nBut the app has evolved a lot since the beginning and many features I didn't think at the time have been included until now.\nIf people are really interested in this feature and there are people willing to implement and help to maintain it later I wouldn't block the implementation from going forward. Otherwise, I would prefer keeping this feature out. Because it would add more complexity and we already don't have enough people to help with the existing issues.. @seesemichaelj What version are you using? We already have that, but it stays in the top right of the sidebar. Doesn't that work for you?. I tried to keep through the whole sidebar. But I couldn't get it working well. I would gladly accept a PR for that though :). Home screen\n\nshow list of servers and search server by name\nshow how to create a new server\nshow how to connect to a server\nshow how to connect to a server with passphrase\nshow how to connect to a server with SSH\nshow how to connect to a server with SSL\nshow how to test a connection\n\nConnection Screen\n\nshow the searching available in the sidebar\nshow the context menus available in the sidebar\nshow the query box with autocomplete\nshow query box and the result with a single query\nshow query box and the result with multiple queries\nshow is possible to execute only the selected query\nshow how an error from the query is printed\nshow how to export to CSV\nshow how to export to JSON\n\nPretty much any feature available could have its own gif. Then we could have a page listing all the features and the demo for each one. Would be better than a single long demo with all features.. I guess is easier start with the FEATURES.md and move later to the website (could be another task though). . Thanks @hugmanrique!!. @goepichero  Sorry, I don't have a RDS to test it. But by the comments from this other issue https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/167 the RDS connection/queries seems to be working for other people.\nCouldn't that be a permission issues for that table?. Thanks Sir :). Fair enough. We can handle the overflow-x mentioned by @BornaP in a separated PR.\n@s-kem Thanks again :). Those back slash commands are specific for that command line tool. They are not part of the SQL. \nOn Postgres you can list tables like this:\nsql\nSELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables;. Yeah feels good with that cursor. And it is much better to be able to resize through the whole sidebar. Thank you!!. Sqlectron is a desktop app. I don't think is possible to use it as a command line to see the version. But you can check the version in the initial loading screen or in the menu bar.. I have implemented this on the branch merged above. But there are some caveats:\n\nOSX: it doesn't work because is not possible to start an app like a binary (I have to use the tool open to start the app from the command line and open -a /Applications/Sqlectron.app --args --version seems not to work).\nWindows: It prints out the version. But looks like the command still running after that. I had to press Enter to finish it. You will understand when you have tested it. I would appreciate the help from someone with Windows environment to solve that.\nLinux: I have not tested it.. Thanks @mitchellcash!!. @SumantaBee The drag and drop have been disabled by #388. So, we shouldn't have the issue with the window getting stuck without a go back option.\n@synle He (@SumantaBee) want to be able to open sql files on Sqlectron by dragging and dropping a file from the filesystem into the app.. Hey @anas140, it only contains commits from other PRs.. Great work. Thanks @dlion \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f . Yeah, I think that could lead to performance issues pretty easy. I don't think is necessary to save the results. With the restored queries, the user should be able to execute it again with no problem.. @s-kem This week I'm quite busy. I will review/merge it up to Friday though.. Hey @s-kem, I took some time to review it today. The code looks good. But I have found few bugs \ud83d\ude22 \n\nRelated to queries stored state:\n  The \"Select rows\" from the sidebar context menu does not trigger the action to save the query. I have not tested the other context menu options. But believe they probably don't work too.\n The restoring state from a database connection that is not the initial one fails. \nRelated to the \"execute selected text\"\nSeems it is not working anymore. Looks like it is always executing the whole query box content. Here are GIFs showing the before and after:\nBefore your changes\n\nAfter your changes\n\n. No worries, you have been doing a great work so far :)\nBy this quote below, did you mean it will not include the context menu queries?\n\nIn hindsight I would've introduced some unwanted behaviour in saving the state had I not done that.  \n\nI believe on MySQL Workbench it restores all tabs, even the empty ones. I think that is a more expected behaviour at least.\nqueryHistory was supposed to be used for this feature https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/277. But that still has not been implemented yet. In that case, I believe you could just strip that out of the file system stored data.\nSorry, when I wrote down the description for this bug below. I knew it wasn't clear, but I was so lazy that I was hoping you could understand it \ud83d\ude06 \n\nThe restoring state from a database connection that is not the initial one fails\n\nLet's say I have a server with 2 databases: A and B; and have configured in the server connection to A be the initial database.\n\nI open the connection to that server which will automatically open a tab to database A.\nI select the database B in the sidebar and write down a query into the tab to database B.\nI close the whole server connection.\nI connect again to that server. It will start to fail the connection loading.\nI force to close the app.\nI open the app again and change that server connection setting to use database B as the initial one.\nI connect again to that server and now the app works.\n\nI guess you just need to open the database connection to all databases related to the restored tabs.Would be even better if we could restore the tabs in a lazy loading approach. Which would only open the database connection if the user selects a tab related to that database. But that makes the implementation more complicated. So, I'm ok with the first approach.. Related to the \"select\" issue. I agree the second approach seems a better option.\nOk, it is looking better. But I have found other 2 bugs \ud83d\ude22 \n1. Is not resetting the lastCreatedId prop from reducer/queries when there are no tabs to be restored\nMakes sense to keep the lastCreatedId when there are tabs to be restored. But it is weird to keep that value if there are no tabs to restore. \nTo reproduce the bug:\n1. connect to a server\n1. open 3 tabs and close them all\n1. disconnect from that server\n1. connect to that server again\nIt will start from query Id 4 instead of from 1.\n2. Is loading the same database info (tables, views, etc.) from the selected tab to all databases\nTo reproduce the bug:\n1. connect to a server:\n1. open a tab for database A and type down a query into it\n1. open a tab for database B and type down a query into it\n1. disconnect from that server\n1. connect to that server again\n1. take a look in the sidebar, both databases will have the same data. I wasn't able to test it again. I got very busy at work these last days. I will test it as soon as I get some free time.. Sorry @s-kem, I have been traveling and I will not have time to review it for the next month. Since you have been helping a lot in the project. I will make you a contributor \ud83c\udf89 \nLet's just wait like a week if someone else can review it. Otherwise, you can go ahead and merge it.. Hey @BornaP, would be awesome if you could take a look on this one too \ud83d\ude05 . Weird, the logs already appear for me without this change. But I guess there is no problem adding that handle as well.. @Trevormichael I tested it and looks like it is not working:\n\nhey @BornaP, did it work with you?. No problem, I do that sometimes (pretty often) too \ud83d\ude06 . Alright. That is working. Thanks!!. Would be awesome don't have this performance issues anymore. Last time I debugged that, the main problem was the process of converting data to plain objects from the lazy load objects coming from IPC call in the main process.\nUnfortunately, we need to do that because redux states depend on plain objects to handle changes in the app state. Without that hack, the app as getting some pretty messed up state problems.\nBut I have never seen other people describing this kind of issue in other projects. Probably there is a way to solve that.. Sorry, to avoid that message I would need to sign to \"The Apple Developer Program\". But I can't afford it since it is an open source software and that Apple Program has an annual fee of 99 USD.. Not sure is worth the work to configure that if it is already expiring. But that is up to you \ud83d\ude06 \nYeah, it is very sad Apple does not provide that for OSS.. Thanks for reporting that. I had fixed it already but didn't have time to release a new version.\nI will do that later today.\nbtw I'm Brazilian too. Don't be hard on yourself, your Ensligh is good :). That really sounds better. Could you please replace that with:\nIt is pronounced \"sequel-eck-tron\" - https://translate.google.com/?source=osdd#en/en/sequel-eck-tron. That commit is ok. Thanks!!. Sorry @haivp3010, I have been traveling and I have not been having free time to review it. I will try to find someone else who can do it.\nCould someone (@BornaP @s-kem) review it, please? . Looks like a good improvement. Although the scroll bar there may look a bit ugly on Linux and Windows.. That sounds as a useful feature. Do you know which algorithm is that? Also, which are the database and OS you are using?. You can change the logging settings in the Settings modal:\n\n. Nowadays is not possible to change the background color. I mean, if you really want that, you could do that by opening the inspector mode and changing the CSS background color. Would be nice though to support different themes.. Looks like a timeout issue. Is this a remote server? Could you try to change the \nconnectTimeout and acquireTimeout properties in the mysql connection settings https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/db/clients/mysql.js#L353?\n Docs of how to use those properties https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql.. Thanks for the CR @s-kem. Did you check it is working? I will merge it if you approve that.. Yeah, looks like the old Reconnect button on the top right already does that. @synle does that new Refresh button works differently than the Reconnect button? If it has the same behavior I rather keep a single button for it.. Thanks @tgrecojs \ud83d\ude04 . There is an issue there that I can't reproduce it locally. It was supposed to the result table get the full height available and you should be able to scroll through the next rows with the mouse scroll wheel:\n\n. Thanks!!. @alexmylonas thanks for this PR. But there is an issue need to be fixed before I can accept it. After changing the theme it is not loading properly the main window:\n\n. Sorry, I just noticed this was occurring in master and your PR #400 has fixed it. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d . That theme is not looking so good. But it is a good start. I will merge it and see if I can make a bit prettier. Thanks again!!. I can't see that issue on 1.28. #395 should have fixed that already and it has been included in that version. Could you please provide a gif showing that issue?. Do you have any idea how many schemas and tables there are in that database? If there is a huge amount of schemas could you try to limit the loading by filtering schemas with include/ignore filter:\n\nIt could an exception occurring during the database loading as well. In that case, you would need to open the DevTools window on View/Toggle DevTools to see the error properly.\n. Hi @AceVik, thanks for your feedback. But I'm not sure we will get to a point where we have such feature. And here is why: Sqlectron was initially designed to be a simple SQL tool with cross-platform and database support. I imagine supporting a user management for: mysql, mssql, postgres, and etc. would be quite a work and we don't have developers enough contributing to the code base in order to develop and maintaining that feature. So I rather keep it simple than adding such complexity which could easily lead to bugs without a good support. Sorry \ud83d\ude1e . Is that column really a boolean data type or bit/tinyint (any other one similar to that)?\nIf that really is a boolean column and it is not showing as true/false then we should get it fixed. Although we have a handler for that and it should be working already: https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/src/renderer/utils/convert.js#L26\nBut if it is another data type such as bit. I am not sure is a good idea convert its value to true/false since the range could be higher than only 0 and 1.. That is an issue in Ace editor SQL syntax highlight. Take a look at this online demo: https://ace.c9.io/build/kitchen-sink.html\nIf you are interested in getting it solved, please open an issue for that here https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace. I don't have interest going through that work myself \ud83d\ude06 \nBut if that editor supports all features we use nowadays with the current editor and anyone is willing in doing that switch, I wouldn't block that PR if it is working/looking good.. Overall it is looking good. Although, still there are some colors I'm not so glad. But we can improve it over the time or even have different themes in the future. Thanks for all work @synle !!!. Good catch @synle. Thanks again \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f . Looks good, I would just follow the same implementation we already have for getQuerySelectTop\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/blob/master/src/db/clients/postgresql.js#L340\nBecause it can easily have differences between connectors such as the wrapper identifier.. @synle There is this repository with most databases supported by Sqlectron https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-databases. Looking good. Thanks :). Good call. Thanks @synle !!!. It is looking good @synle. It is for sure a good feature. Thanks!!!. So, you are able to connect to a server. But is not able to execute any command in that? Even select and insert commands or just create table is not working?. If select and insert queries are working. But create table and create database are not. It seems a permission issue.. This should give all the privileges available\nsql\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'YOUR_DB_USERNAME_HERE'@'localhost';\nSource: https://askubuntu.com/questions/461064/unable-to-create-database-due-access-denied\nClosing it since it is not a Sqlectron issue.. I like the tagging for servers. We could allow the search per tag such as environment:production.\nThe ability to pin also look useful, it definitly could be done for any object (server, database, tables, and etc.). Just to get it working with queries we would first need to finish https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/371.. @m4sk1n Thanks for this PR. I'm downloading a VM with Linux to test it out. Could you please check why the build is failing on Travis?. @m4sk1n Although you have not changed any specific Windows building code. You have upgraded the electron-builder which by the semver pattern it has some breaking changes. But, by looking elecron-builder docs I can't find if it really has anything that should impact our current configuration.\nI saw electron-builder is working to fix that: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/2458\nYou could downgrade that to 19.52.1 which seems to not have that issue.. If you want to disable the splash screen it should be possible to do it by adding \"disabledOpenAnimation\": true to your configuration file https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/app/configuration-file.md . I was contacted by mahongquan weeks ago. But I didn't agree with the way the changes were driven on his fork (mostly commit messages and the way changes were done). I spent a long time building this app and I hope to pass the ownership to someone who shares few common guides:\n keep the commit history clean, so it makes easier for contributors to maintain the project (a great article about that: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\n keep the master branch clean, do not commit debugging stuff that should live a separated development branch\nI don't want to be picky. I'm just thinking about the future of the project to keep it easy for other contributors to join and understand the project history and codebase.. @dsofeir I'm still waiting for someone to take it over :) If you prefer to discuss it in private just DM me on Twitter @maxcnunes.. Hey @barneydmedia, or anyone who comes after you, feel free to close this issue and remove the unmaintained labels from the project if you think you are ready to take over the project. \ud83d\ude4f \ud83c\udf89 \nFor others interested in taking over, I just answered an email to @dsofeir with details of how to do it, and it is the same for anyone else:\n\nI'm looking for people who can improve this project or at least keep the existing quality. In my opinion, the best way to analyze it is through a PR so I can check those details. For example, @barneydmedia sent a PR https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/436 and I added him as a contributor. Then he merged and released a new version himself.. Hey @barneydmedia, you sent two good PRs. I'm adding you as a contributor, feel free to merge these changes and releasing a new version if you feel like doing that. Thanks!. hey @barneydmedia, neither do I. We distribute the app without sign in it. Here are the steps if you want to release it https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/blob/master/docs/development/release.md. There is a re-build commit at button\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxcnunes/sqlectron-gui/build/1.0.673. I\njust triggered a new build.\nLet me know if you can't see that button, I may need to change your role in\nthe project.\n\nOn Wed, Sep 5, 2018 at 2:59 PM Barney Davis notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@maxcnunes https://github.com/maxcnunes I ran through the guide, but\nthe build failed. From what I can tell in the log, it looks like the build\njust got hung up on downloading one of the assets or maybe binaries from\nAWS. Is there a way to restart the build and try again?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/436#issuecomment-418823712,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAphpOjM7gQZ8u3xNb1rDtq5HHB2x_Z9ks5uYBDtgaJpZM4SppDP\n.\n. Thanks. The current error object that is coming from Knex is not giving much useful information. While we don't improve this error message I though in just display the whole raw error object and using pre we keep a better indentation for the output object. But this is just temporary, in the future we should display a label with useful error messages.\n. I didn't like the name either. I had thought in name it getDBConnection as well but actually it is more than only a database connection. It is the sqlectron-db that is a wrap over knex.js. In the end I chose Session inspired on nhinbernate.\n\n@esnunes what do you think?\n. So is it gonna be getServerSession?\n. Merging it to master. We can pick up a better name later.\n. Yes. I am keeping it outside of the app just before the first release. To not increase the size of the git repository in case we change the images.\n. Sure.\n. box-sizing is not a valid react style attribute https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html\n. max-widht and paddign-right are not valid react style attributes\n. padding-left is not a valid react style attribute\n. ResizableBox does not support style property. Actually it is crashing the ResizableBox.\n. Could replace all this code with: \njs\nthis.state({ [toggledList]: !this.state[toggledList] });\n. There is no need for else statement if the previous if is already leaving the function.\n. Sorry. I mean: this.setState({ [toggledList]: !this.state[toggledList] }); then there is no need for if/else.\n. Shouldn't it check if the port field has a value already?\n. We don't use this standard of underscore for private functions. Could you please change it?\n. Running the app I realized the title \"Click twice to select...\" is showing even when I am with the mouse over the columns name. Should be good change the title now to appear only over the table name.\n. Please do not use underscore for private variables.\n. No need for return in this case. Could do:\njs\n.map(column => ({\n  ...\n}))\n. I hope we find a icon for views as well in the future. This will keep the same pattern for both types.\n. Do you think these commands should be included in the menu as well?\n. Could have a separate menu for that. Which would not cause this misunderstanding. But I guess is better keep it simple for now.\n. Could you avoid nested if and else statements. For instance this first if could be changed to leave the function. And the next if leave the function after appending the menu item.\n. Seems is missing remove the  fixed-data-table from the dependencies.\n. Seems this fixing is not related to this issue. Do you mind moving them to a separated PR?\n. This line is to large. Could move the component content to before the return or at least break the component content in multiple lines?\n. Can the refs be null or undefined at some time? Well, seems it is not related to this issue. If you could move it with the other one I suggested before would give us a better tracking in the repository history.\n. Do we really need JQuery to set values for the checkbox? Why not use only react for that?\n. Usually is better place the external styles before the internal customized styles. So they have \"higher\" rules.\n. There is no need for template string here.\n. There is no need for template string here.\n. In case a error occurs. Shouldn't it be displayed to the user? But if the console.log is really required. An approach that I would suggest is using a suffix in the log, such as console.log('Error rendering diagram', err);. Because in case an error comes as undefined because of some internal problem. At least we know is passing through this catch.\n. I guess there is too much stuff going on in the componentDidMount. If you could break down in smaller functions would be really great. Maybe everything that you have included a comment can become a function.\n. This line is too long. Could you break down each property in a new line?\n. Break down this line :)\n. This could be rewritten into this:\njs\nconst selectedTables = $(':checkbox:checked', 'div.ui.list')\n  .map((index, checkbox) => checkbox.id);\n. Also, is there a reason is using JQuery here instead of only react?\n. Is there a reason for self invoking function here? If it really has reason for that I guess including some comment would help understanding it in the future.\n. Feels quite weird accessing the DOM inside the redux actions. Isn't this something you could do from where you are calling this function and just pass the result as argument to exportDatabaseDiagram? Maybe I'm wrong, but I have never seen this approach before.\n. Could we remove this empty function?\n. And this one too.\n. Is not recommend setting the state like this. Should use this.setState({ autoColumnWidths }). Also would give a better code readability if we could move the loop above to a function.\n. I guess there is no need using self there since looks like you are only using arrow functions. So the context is always the one from the root function.\n. We usually keep the CSS styles in files related to the component.\n. Could you remove this commented code line?\n. Please break down the curly in a new line.\n. Please break down the closing \"tag\" in a new line.\n. No need for === true.\n. Should not change the this.state directly. It can drive into problems to react managing the state changes. Use this.setState instead of that.\n. Please break down the closing \"tag\" in a new line.\n. These all are changing the this.state directly (even trough a new variable). With ES2015 you could do something like this:\njs\nthis.setState({\n  tableheights: {\n    ...this.state.tableheights,\n    [table]: height,   \n  },\n});\n. We do not use flow. Could you please remove this comment?\n. We do not use flow. Could you please remove this comment?\n. Please break down the closing \"tag\" in a new line.\n. Please break down the closing \"tag\" in a new line.\n. Please remove this empty function.\n. Please break down the closing \"tag\" in a new line.\nAlso there is no need using quotes for these properties.\n. There is no need to bind it here. You could bind it directly where your are passing this function ahead =::this._onScroll\n. If is not required anymore then it could be removed.\n. Would be good if it had been included in a different commit and pull request.\nBut I will not make you rebase the PR just because of it. Just keep in mind next time to break down the pull request.\n. Could you remove the space between the ! and itemsByTable?\n. Could you remove the space between the ! and items?\n. Since you gonna fix that. Could you also replace itemsByTable[table].length === 0 with !itemsByTable[table].length? Is the way you usually use it in the project.\n. Could you make the input file button only be visible for sqlite? I believe this button could be confuse for most users using the other database clients that does work with local files.. I believe it is used to allow executing a selected query through the shortcut. That function is going to update the \"current query\". Without that the shortcut to execute the selected query probably won't work.. wow this trick is new to me \ud83d\ude04 . ",
    "esnunes": "I like option B my-file.jsx using lowercase only. I agree with Max regarding the usage of folder name to identify a section. However, as Max mentioned, in case you prefer using the suffix I have no problems with that.\n. Can you check for null values before converting to string? Another option would be using JSON.stringify(value) in this case it would be possible to see if the value is true or \"true\"\n. I think the concept of a Server Session fits to the requirements due to the fact that the back-end of the application must handle tunnels and connections issues like a drop of a connection.\n. ",

    "BornaP": "Seems like react-tabs repository is inactive recently (at least admins are), even if someone makes PR it's very unlikely it will be accepted anytime soon.\n. I agree with third option that you mentioned. We could implement shortcut for that. Tab can be closed on mouse click anyways (by clicking the x button). Secondly, I see that there are some request for implementing support for custom mouse events on react-tabs, so I think it will be implemented eventually and then we can add that to our app easily.\n. Regarding PostgreSQL: Why don't we just connect user to default maintenance db postgres if no DB is provided, it seems that's the way pgAdmin III works?\n. But I think bigger problem is decoupling database param in GUI. If it won't be required, database parameter in the route should be either optional (?database) or there should be container component with route /server which would render database list (so that user can select DB) and contain current query-browser.jsx. Correct me if I'm wrong :smile: \n(this is for mysql and mssql where no DB has to be provided to establish connection)\n. Yeah, that sounds great (removing database parameter from the route).\nRegarding second point I agree, maybe query-box should be hidden, but on the other hand user should be enabled to create/drop databases. Maybe it should be enabled through some menu or a button if there won't be any query-box until database is selected.\n. I compiled sqlectron-core with this commit and surprisingly, everything runs smoothly without having to change anything in GUI. \nBoth test connection and connect works fine. When user writes query without previously selecting database, it runs as expected. \nSELECT * FROM database_name.table_name;\nworks fine, while:\nSELECT * FROM table_name;\nreturns error that database is not selected.\n\nSince this works fine, I would leave query box enabled, so that user can normally execute queries (like create/drop databases, running select with properly addressed database before table name etc.).\nOnly problem is one related to PostgreSQL, where if no database selected it connects to postgres. Problem is that it does not collapse postgres database list initially like it does when you manually select database. So that can confuse user at first. But I guess this can be put in another issue. Anyways, I'll try to fix it later today.\nI guess it works for MSSQL as well since build is passing.\n. You were right, changed it and now it works smoothly. :clap: \nPR request is updated, and new one on sqlectron-gui is made. I tested it locally for MySQL and PostgreSQL and it works.\nPS. Seems there is a problem with building it on AppVeyor, but it seems there is a problem in the beginning with installing modules (sqlite3), not code itself (previous build was fine and new commit shouldn't have affected it much).\n. This is what pgAdmin III returns when you try to delete it:\n\nMaintenance database can't be dropped.\n\nSo I guess we don't have to worry about that.\n. @krolow @maxcnunes My bad, now I see if you change maintenance database you can (through console with arbitrary query). \nIn that case sqlectron won't establish connection and will return:\n\nConnection Error\ndatabase \"postgres\" does not exist\n\nUser will still be able to update server connection and reconnect. Since, as far as I now, postgres is default maintenance database, if someone deletes it, it means he had to changed it to some other database so he will know the name of database he needs to connect to. \nUpdate: Same way pgAdmin works, postgres is used as default maintenance database. If you have changed maintenance db on server, connection will fail with similar error, unless you have entered it manually while defining connection.\n. @darkwisperer You're welcome! :)\n. I'm glad you opened ticket for this issue, because I wanted to do the same :+1: \nI think structure similar to one in mysql workbench is optimal here. I would keep triggers (and I would add columns) collapsed under each table and views, SP and functions should be in their own collection to separate them from the tables. Something like this:\n\nI'll try to contribute on this in a next couple of days/weeks. Also, @maxcnunes ,could you put 'Enhancement' label to the issue.\n. Hey @maxcnunes ! I took a look at gui part today and here are my thoughts. I was thinking about adding actions and reducers for both views and routines separately, similarly like its done now for tables. Furthermore, maybe it's good idea to extract rendering tables, views and routines in separate component (or components), instead of keeping it all in database-list.jsx . Speaking of UI, here's how I imagined it - under each database we would have submenu consisting of three items - tables, views, routines (SP and functions for mysql/sqlserver, and only functions for postgresql). Tables would, by default, be expanded and shown, while views and routines would be loaded on click. All three would be collapsible. \nWhat do you think? I'd like to hear your opinion before I start with implementation :)\n. Thanks!\nI agree completely with comments regarding the code. I'll make changes and push new commit! \n. Changed! :)\n. You're welcome @maxcnunes ! \n. Regarding the last approach, you were thinking that we should store state object between connections on same server(client) regarding info about toggled menus and than on each database select (app refresh), render database list accordingly?\n. @maxcnunes  Okay cool, thanks for the heads up :)\n. @maxcnunes I see, my bad, haven't thought about that scenario. I'll try to figure it out later today or tommorow when I catch some time. \nMaybe another soultion could be additional checking if sessionServer fits serverConfig in current scope and create a new one if it doesn't.\n. Updated. Session is now discarded if it fails to connect. At first I thought about using error.code to check if server connection fails, but than I realized there are several more use cases with severe bugs like when you try to connect to nonexistent DB (in mysql) and then try to connect to postgresql which is shut down, but has database with same name like one in mysql, it would connect to mysql server and entitle database list like it is PostgreSQL server. \nSo I returned to first thing @maxcnunes proposed and on error checked if current connection is connected to any database. It works just fine.\n. Yeah this one looks much better. Collapse icon should definitely stay.\nMaybe children items should have indention, so it feels more like they are children of item above them. I think its a best practice when it comes to this tree structures. Probably adding left padding would do the trick, so that children items are aligned with first/second letter of parent node.\n. Great, this looks much better now :+1: \n. I'll try to fix it.\n. Seems that bug only occurs when table has more than 15 columns.\n. Sure, no problem!\n. @maxcnunes Again, new version of electron does not handle all errors properly. This time it does not return error on running query without addressing database or connecting to PostgreSQL without existing default db. Instead of error being rendered it gets stuck in infinite loop. I'll degrade it back again since with 0.36.12 everything works fine.\n. Good idea! Search filter should probably be placed somewhere under the 'Tables' header.\nIf this will be implemented, and having in mind we might fetch & list table columns/triggers (on a click on single table) in future, maybe it's good idea to make side menu bit wider after implementing this.\nI can jump on this after resolving #111 \n. Although A is quite interesting solution, I also fancy option B. It's simple, has one step less than A (which is better) and get's the job done :)\n. I'll probably make PR for this tommorow.\n. Yeah it was, took me a while to figure it out. You're welcome! :)\n. Sure thing!\n\nBasically, it's styled the same as the filter for databases (well it is the same component at the end haha).\nEDIT: Query panel looks squeezed because I had dev tools opened on the right. \n. Yeah, I agree with you. \nAgain, you're welcome, glad I can contribute! \\o/\n. Although issue was resolved with this commit, I'll leave this issue open for further discussion on autocomplete enhancement. \nAs mentioned in  #128 , both basic and live autocompletion should be optional (hence user should be able to enable and disable it). Furthermore, there's way to include tables and columns in autocompletion by writing custom completer, explained here.\n. I like the idea with icons! Made both syntactic code changes (column actions now follows structure of similar action files) you proposed and added the icons. It looks much better now!\nRegarding showing user if it is clickable or not. I thought about adding collapse icon next to tables and on collapse, sub menu with two headers would show up. On clicking those headers, columns/triggers should show. That's what I asked about, whether to resolve this by making new component or reusing old one.\nSo something like this:\n ....\nv Table_1\n   v Columns \n         id\n         col1\n         ...\n    > Triggers\nAlso, I'm aware that there is a bug that when you double click a table it performs a standard query and fetches columns. That's why I thought maybe standard query should be moved in right click menu (as I searched it is something doable in electron) or some other solution. Furthermore, maybe double clicking column should perform standard query only on that attribute?\nWell that's just my 2 cents, what do you think about this? :)\n. Sounds good :) Regarding MySQL Workbench, I've version 6.2 and there clicking over a column does nothing, while in context menu there is option to execute standard query. Since at the moment we don't (or even won't) have any more actions over specific column, I guess executing standard query with only that column included would be fine. Maybe later there could be included some kind of query builder where user could select more columns..but later on that, that would be a feature of its own :smile: \nPS. We've got 300th star on sqlectron-gui repo! :smile: \n. Updated, each table now has its own submenus. At the moment there's only submenu for columns, next thing is doing the same thing for triggers. Also, hovering over tables changes mouse pointer so users will know its clickable. However, it would be nice to make each table collapseable too.\nRemoved unnecessary table icons next to views, functions and prodecures.\nI moved table submenu in separate component because of easier handling collapsibles. Secondly, whole rendering is specific to table so I think it's cleaner this way.\n. @maxcnunes I added table triggers and made whole menu collapsible. Now tables can be collapsed as well. Here's how it looks:\n\nAs far as I tested it, clicking again on table won't make new request for fetching columns/triggers (if they are already fetched), it will just collapse/expand it, which is good.\nI guess this is it for this PR. I suggest moving context menu in separate issue/PR, to keep it cleaner because that's feature of its own. \nI'll leave it to you to review and test it locally and , if it is good enough, merge it. :)\n. Thanks Max, you're very welcome! I agree on typography thou, but as you said when we get feedback we can change that :)\n. You mean like getting SQL definition of table/procedure/view? If so, I had something like that in mind. Definitely something we will implement in foreseeable future I guess!\n. Resolved with #141 \n. I thought about just selecting the whole text (so user can copy it), but I think modal would be fine :) That way user would be able to see whole string on double click.\n. @maxcnunes Great! Regarding including table names and columns in the autocomplete, we will probably just have to write our own completer which would contain tables/columns by database. If you want you can take a look, why not :)\nAnd as regards to keeping options in configuration, that's easly doable as what you have describe fits enableBasicAutocompletionoption, while automatic autocomplete fits enableLiveAutocompletion. So I guess we could keep those bool vals in config.\nThanks for the merge! :tada: \n. Sure thing, I'll try to get this done until the weekend\n. @maxcnunes I caught some little time for this and couldn't get it working today. I'll be off over the weekend so I'll get back to this later (if you won't resolve it in meantime). \nI tried to write custom completer following link earlier mentioned (which would include tables related to current database connection). I sent database name (connections.databases[0]) and tables.itemsByDatabase object as props to Query component, but problem was that database name is set to undefined at first moment for some reason.\n. @maxcnunes Ah sorry, I self-assigned it, but something else kicked in later. Forgot about it. If you have time to work on this one, feel free to reassign it. :). Awesome, thanks for help on that! :+1: \n. I'm not sure if it is a good practice to require only a single click for opening new database connection, because user can click it by mistake and open new connection redundantly.\n. I agree with solution Max proposed :+1: \n. I think there is no database gui client (i.e. MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin) which shows newly created database/table without manually clicking on reloading data, but I agree we can try to implement this. Or at least put 'refresh button' which would reload databases and tables (like other clients do)\n. Sure, give it a go! :)\n. Wow, that's some great news! The whole idea that you went on writing your own SQL parser is just impressive itself, and now that you have working solution that's just brilliant :) Bem feito @maxcnunes ! (hope I got it right haha)\n. Closed with 33548c93aa445639bb010f362c58396257554d67\n. Closed with 6a08e01a23ff023fa73d913ba72665393e58db73\n. Oh and by the way, execute default query is moved to context menu. This is because a single table click fetches columns/triggers, so double clicking on it was not a good UX.\n. Alright then, I'll try to finish this tommorow :)\n. Refactored code, added fetching functions/procedures SQL definitions and fixed behavior so it updates SQL editor when user selects script he selected earlier (so it's already fetched on front-end). \nThere are two thing that should be changed in future, but I think they should be separate PR's: \n- Handling function/procedure SQL definition: This should have an API call on sqlectron-core, instead of current logic. Current logic is kind of a hack, we just read current store object and dispatch updateQueryIfNeeded action in query-browser container. I think it's better to make changes on back-end, so this has it's own API call, like fetching table/view scripts. Beside having a cleaner code on front-end, we could enhance SQL definition of routines for MySQL/PostgreSQL that way (put CREATE statement around it etc.). I was thinking about implementing this next, but will do that on another PR since it needs changes on back-end too.\n- Append script to current query in editor - Queries actions should be extended with appendQueryIfNeeded. I think it's better to handle previewing scripts that way than updating whole query (like it's now) or opening new tab. Reason - in most use cases when you use default scripts you already have some kind of query or you want to use more scripts at the same time. Simple use-case, mostly when I use create/update/delete scripts I use select script to see changes made. Anyways, it's not a big issue, so I guess this too can go into a another PR if we agree on implementing this.\nWell, I guess this is it for this PR. @maxcnunes @krolow any thoughts? :)\n. With last commit upgraded to newest sqlectron-core and changed the way of fetching routines SQL (create statement) definition. Also, removed those unnecessary template strings as @krolow  suggested.\nRegarding second suggestion. Since adding appendQueryIfNeeded to queries actions is self-contained change, I'll implement that in separate PR.\n. Since Travis CI build failure is related to another change and not this PR, I'll merge it into master.\n. I've spent some time trying to get this working but I think we will have to wait a bit with this. There's definitely problem with newer electron version handling Promise.reject from remote. Error gets swallowed and cannot be caught (for example here ). It might be correlated to newer Chromium versions since on v0.37.0 it was upgraded to Chrome 49, and last working version for our case is still 0.36.12. There's issue opened for this in April and marked as bug. Check it out. \nThat being said, and having in mind a lot of our calls on back-end API depend on Promise resolve/reject, I'd stick to 0.36.12 and wait for updates on this bug. However, I'll open PR with changes for easier upgrade (since old way of requiring electron modules is deprecated and not supported in v1.x).\n. Issue has been resolved, so I'll wait for new release (that includes this changes) to check it out if it works :)\n. Closed via #169 \n. @Grelek I see you're using latest Node version, have you tried with v4.4.4 LTS (latest recommended for most linux users)?\n. Thank you @denysvitali !\n. I like the idea, big thumbs up for this! It looks much more 'native' for this kind of app. I'll try to implement #126 as soon as possible!\n. I'm for leaving it enabled by default until we get normal settings window. Else, new user maybe won't be familiar it even exists.\n. I agree on adding this! Link to the markdown file sounds good enough, but if you were thinking about creating a wiki page anyway, then that would be a better solution! :)\n. You mean like focus search field on keyboard shortcut?\n. Yeah you're right, sqlectron does not support them, it currently reads only public schema of certain database (if DB engine supports schemas). Since only PostgreSQL of all database that we support has schemas, I guess it would require writing some code specific only for postgres case, since the app is hybrid.\n. I agree with you on that. We'll see whether to implement schemas in database list so that user can browse between schemas (if they exists) or as you said, enable user to select schema when connecting to database.\nI guess first option might be doable with making component that would be hidden when not using postgres (hence when method in back-end, let's call it getDatabaseSchemas , would not return anything).\n. I'm not really using this much, but I think ssh key pass phrase should not be stored as a plain text in configuration, because what's the essence of using secure tunneling then. So prompting user on connection for pass phrase would be better approach I guess.\n. Haha I know, it's really useful feature :smile: I meant in a way that I might be wrong as I'm not using it regularly. But I'm glad you too agree on modal :smile: \n. Really glad to see it was that easy to implement it on GUI! As you said, it's indicator of good architecture design \\o/\n@maxcnunes :clap: :clap: :clap: Great feature, I know it took you some time writing sql-query-identifier but it was worth it. At least, it can be said now that we have one single feature some other SQL gui clients don't haha.\n. Yeah I agree with you, approach you proposed is much neater.\n. @maxcnunes I'll be off till Monday, so feel free to finish this if you want to :smile: I see you have implemented better approach so probably my commits for this PR are not needed.\nCheers!\n. Ctrl+. is fine if you ask me. Any other alternative I can think of is F3 (I think it's used for search in some programs). Or perhaps / instead of F if it is not used for other shortcuts in editor. All three sound alright, so it's your call! :smile: \n. Forgot to do npm install afterwards. Ignore this, my bad. It's working perfectly! :)\n. Is this necessary if databases and tables are refreshed automatically on create/drop? \n. Good job @maxcnunes ! :)\n. I pulled this locally and it does not work as neatly as expected:\n- At first I get only one row showed up in the table view and have to scroll for each following row. Later for some reason (probably because of resizing developers tools) it resized to 4 rows displayed at once. I'd change this to always have fixed number of N rows displayed in a view.\n- There's an error I'm getting constantly:\n  \n- I'd return ellipsis to the end of too long texts (it's css property).  And probably set max width of the cell to lower number of characters to reduce horizontal scrolling (I'd follow approach of Workbench and MS Studio here - I think both are limited to 220 px cell width).\n. Cool cool cool. Just regarding 2nd point, are you sure you can't reproduce that error? Because sometimes I can't, but sometime it happens on resize. I guess this might be related to debounce time, maybe we should increase it a bit?\n. I'm okay with that, let's merge this then! :)\nPS. I'm using Ubuntu 15.04\n. @maxcnunes @krolow @esnunes : All suggestions and opinions are welcome!\n. GoJS is $1350 per developer :smile:  But no worries, I think JointJS has everything necessary to customly build simple ERD diagram. Will give it a try!\n. UPDATE: \nAfter including latest changes in sqlectron-core, this is what I got so far:\n\nIt's working on live data! (on picture it's some sample database I had locally)\nMost time I 'wasted' debugging JointJS in modal window, but it works smooth now. Diagram is generated on clicking 'Show Database Diagram' option in database context menu. Since every diagram needs columns and links, I call fetchColumnsIfNeeded for every table included. Since it takes some time for more tables, here's what I was thinking in implementing next:\n- Upon clicking the option, before generating diagram, modal would be shown up asking user to select which tables he wants to include on diagram (with 'Select All' option available). This is because it might not work proper on much bigger databases with > 100 tables. Furthermore, sometimes because of pure simplicity one only wants some of the objects included on diagram.\n- After user selects tables and views he wants to include on diagram, loading spinner would show up until all needed data is fetched. Then diagram would be rendered in the same modal window.\nAlso changes I've in mind:\n- Further enhancements on diagram looks.\n- Storing and opening previously generated diagrams. \n- Exporting graph to SVG. Check out if there is possibility to export graph to PNG or some other picture format.\n. Hey @joeblew99 ,thanks for the feedback. The 'other way' you have mentioned is actually currently implemented (the SQL Server way) in the master. New tables are added in front of the others, so devs can move them as they like and SAVE the layout (positions are saved). This is fully resolved with #192 .\nI'm don't think first approach you mentioned would be good in our case as it might make use of 'paper' badly, because there might be lots of scroll vertically and lot of empty space horizontally. That's why I think its the best to let developers move tables and joints (arrow might be moved around the table and links can be pulled on any point you like). Just makes user move flexible and a lot of them are used to this because SQL Server studio does the similar thing :)\nCurrently I'm still working on this, next thing is marking PK and FKs on the table, enabling export to SVG and 'add related tables' feature which would enable user to add tables that current table has references to. This would provide easy way to check referential integrity constraints. I plan on finishing this withing the week, I'll keep you update on this issue.\n. I'm not sure I quite understand you. We're already saving the whole diagram into a JSON as a file, so that user can load it from file. All tables, links (their 'view') and their positions are saved, actually whole SVG is saved and you can manipulate the diagram when you open it as you want.\nI don't think there is a need to save a diagram into a actual database, as this application uses none. This is primary SQL editor. If someone wants to save JSON into DB he can do it manually after save :)\n. Since the feature was implemented with #189 and further enhanced with #192 , #194 ,#195 and #198 , I'll close the issue. Further enhancements or possible bugs should be discussed in their own issues. \n. I think changing font color to some faded black or grey should do the job.\n. Agree, definitely something that should be implemented.\n. Update: It seems there's Node v6 incompatibility with pg module we use. There's a problem with authentication, in short error saying that password is wrong keeps showing up, while password is actually alright. There's an open issue. Since electron ~1.1 uses Node v6, I guess we hit another wall on updating to a major release.\n. Haha, somewhere in 2030 maybe. Well, I'll leave this open, because that issue might be solved soon so you can pull that changes to your fork we are pulling pg package from.\n. @maxcnunes There is actually already existing commit that solves this issue, so you call pull it on your fork. Check it out.\n. It's working :tada: :raised_hands: \n. Ah, seems I've overlooked that :/ Could you please try debug it, and if it is not something that can be easily solved, we should revert this commit to 0.36.12 again.\n. Sounds good. Feel free to revert it :+1: \n. Nice :clap: \n. @CommanderXL Have you tried what Max suggested, allowing apps from unidentified sources? Or running version 1.9.0?\n. Thanks for the feedback @ghedwards ! We are aware of the first point you made. Regarding the second one, could you explain a bit more, how much tables do you have? Do you find it laggy because of live auto complete? Because I did not find it to be laggy on databases with around 130 tables. (without using auto complete feature).\n. @ghedwards Good job, nice PR :clap: \nI'll leave it on Max to test it locally and merge it.\n. @ghedwards  First off, sorry to hear the bad news about your wife, hope she'll be okay. \nSecondly, no need to rush this PR. Feel free to take your time on resolving all issues.\n. :+1: for slack!\n. @eMerzh Thanks for PR and fixing the bug! :clap:  Will merge it after you make proposed changes.\n. @JediMindtrick First off, it's great to hear you use it often at work :) Secondly, this feature has been implemented with f02161f76eb0d696ea5219ab6e7a0cd1960b382c and 9073f2512cc2751049b11889c890b65f21875870. As Max mentioned earlier, you have to pull latest changes from master to have this option available since no new release has been published since implementing that. \nOption is available on right clicking procedure name. \n. @JediMindtrick This feature is now available in new release v1.9.0 :)\n. If we are ever going to have DB statistics (like allocation on disk, pages and stuff) I think better feature would be to make it visualized. Pure data in text form can be retrieved through SQL anyways (and is available in every SQL editor). On the other hand, for example, showing disk allocation per table as tree map graph would make much more sense for the end user :)\nBut as someone said earlier... this is currently low priority I guess.\n. @eMerzh As Max said, one thing at the time. Start with a single feature you find most useful :)\n. Thanks @maxcnunes ! \nYeah you are right. User should not be able to disconnect links from elements. I'll (actually already have) changed that, but will leave option to user to bend connections on joints and move the place where link is positioned on the element - called port in JointJs (this two combine for very useful feature: if you have a lot of tables and don't want links to overlap). Something like this (links can only be bent and moved around the same element, not disconnected):\n\nI know you were planning on 1.9.0 for quite some time and I think it's better to make this release without this feature and then include it in the one after that so that users have more options on choosing which version to use :) Also, as mentioned before, I plan on adding some additional features to this diagram like saving so I guess when all that is complete we can publish it in its own release. TL; DR feel free to make a new release tomorrow without this :smile: \nI'll make changes you proposed in code! \n. This also happens on Ubuntu (15.04), but only when I try to resize column width.\n. You can switch databases by simple double clicking database name on the side menu. It will open new query tab which will be related to that database connection. \nAlso you don't have to specify your database when connecting on database server, it's optional :)\n. You're welcome. Thanks for the feedback, probably indicator we should improve UX on that.\n. Okay, could do that. Don't know what to display in a header though, ${database_name} diagram  or just 'Diagram' since user can select only some of the tables to display?\n. I know this is not strictly related to this PR, but since it's a small change I pushed it here.\n. Good catch! Thanks @fdaciuk :+1: :clap: \n. You're welcome @maxcnunes . I made suggested code change, so If you are okay with npm warning, I'll merge changes into master.\n. I suggest naming tabs after database connection, instead of selected tables as several queries on different tables may be chosen in the same SQL tab.\nIf more then one tab is opened on the same database connection, it could be suffixed with integer. Ex. 'information_schema', 'information_schema 2' and so on.\nThis would give user quite useful info to distinguish tabs.\n. Nice \ud83d\udc4d \n. @commondream I think it might be problem related to electron framework and Windows platform. I found out the same problem with Atom editor and 32-bit WIndows 7 some time ago. Application is 'installed' but cannot be seen under 'Programs and Features'. One solution is to make shortcut on desktop/menu-bar right after application starts for the first time. That way you should always be able to start application.\n. @marvinrichter You're right about that, but Max and abourget were talking about saving whole state of lastly opened window, which is another feature.\nI'll try to implement opening query from file option (with a shortcut too) as soon as I catch some time. Hopefully this weekend.. Hey @thoma87 unfortunately no progress on this. Paid job kicked in heavy. I'll try and implement this as soon as possible. If you have time meanwhile, you are more than welcome to make a PR.. Hey @acotillard ,\nFinally caught some time for this. I'll notify you here when PR is merged and new release has been published :)\nCheers!\n. @acotillard new release with this feature is up! :). Hey @acotillard, glad you find it helpful.\nAbout proposal, well it's bit more complicated than that, because every tab is related to a certain database. I guess we could do that so that all queries selected are spawned as tabs in a current database connection. I will try to work that out soon.\nCheers!. \ud83d\udc4d  PR is welcome on this.\n. Sure, go ahead, all PR are very welcome! :)\nI too agree on tabs naming convention you proposed.\n. That's even nicer to hear ;)\n. I believe this was enabled in earlier versions. @MarioBlazek tried connecting to MySQL with v1.15 without entering the password. Connection testing went fine, but clicking Connect button failed, which is weird.\n. Will take a look.. There is already something similar, when you click on a table you get a context menu with automatically generated scripts for altering the table. I considered enhancing it with additional features you mentioned, but was never really high priority. Since there are examples in a code how to make context menu, and how to generate custom SQL scripts in sqlectron-core, I highly encourage you to try implement it yourself and possible make a pull request ;) Shouldn't be too complicated.. @erikvido Thanks for a feedback. I strongly encourage you to make a fix, run the test and make PR on sqlectron-core repo if it fixes a problem.. Duplicate of #296 . I'm generally, but have lately been postponing it weekend by weekend. So if you really want to dig into it, go for it. :)\nHave in mind you'll have to support all listed databases, hence make PR for sqlectron-core and sqlectron-gui.. Hi guys. Most of previous maintainers, including me, don't use Sqlectron in day to day jobs, which is why I personally lost bit of interest in adding new features. However, this is open source, and all contributions are welcome. As stated above, to add feature like this, you have to implement the feature in sqlectron-core repository, and than use it in gui.. Duplicate of #330 , so I'll close the issue.. Since the issue is answered and we have an issue for querying thousands of records, I'll close this one.. Hi Itai,\nI'm not sure if you mean on creating a DB as 'create statement with DB name' or an editor where you could automatically build database with certain tables. If it's the latter I don't think we will ever support it. However, if you meant just on a generating create statement I encourage you to implement it and create a PR as it's should be fairly ease feature to start with.\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core is there repo where all the database client logic is implemented.\nAfter that, you can add 'Create database' option on the context menu of a connection name (you'll get somewhat familiar with Electron framework here).\nCheers!. I'd add \"show how to generate DB diagram\" to connection screen features as well :). Thanks, that's indeed a typo. . @rodrigowirth have you tested if searching tables without schemas (for DB engines like MySQL) still works with this change?. In order to avoid column primitive type to wrap in a new row, I propose setting overflow-x to auto on whole tree list, so those inner child elements that don't fit container size, can be scrolled without native scrollbar initially showing. This way if user doesn't size sidebar to fit all the content, he can still scroll it through. Currently wrapping primitive type under a column name feels very messy.. Hehe, this one has a looong history :) I'll take a look as soon as possible.\nCongrats @s-kem for joining contributors crew ;). Can you explain the PR bit more. What toggling the checkbox should do?\nAlso, for performance issues, you should probably make handler methods and use ::this.[methodName] syntax like the rest of the code does. Your current code makes two new functions in memory on each render cycle.. Seems fine to me. I'll merge it. Thank you @Trevormichael \ud83d\udc4f . Argh, seemed so simplistic, I didn't bothered to test manually. Sorry, my bad \ud83d\ude32 . @maxcnunes I think I've active Apple Program, so I can try and sign it. However, it's expiring pretty soon and I won't extend it most probably, so I think we will have same issue with further releases \ud83e\udd14 . Would be nice if Apple would give option to sign open source software for free though.\n. I think the same, not worth a trouble :)\nShall we close it?. I'll take a look. Hey @haivp3010 thanks for Pull requests. There's an issue though. When you execute some query and collapse menu afterwards, part of the table is whitened out:\n\nCould you please take a look :). Cool. I'll check it today or tomorrow afternoon (European time ;) ). Since @s-kem has resolved re-rendering issue, I'll merge this PR. Thank you @haivp3010 \ud83d\udc4f . There's support for refresh of every database (context menu on database name). However for refresh of a current connection you're supposed to reload the app for now. I don't think it's a big issue, but if you find it so, PR is welcome :). Fixed. Will be released with next version.. Great, thanks @s-kem ! I agree, no need for throttle/debounce.. I'll take a freedom to sound like Microsoft support and just say: \"You can't, it's not an option\". \ud83d\ude03  . Fix on master. Thank you @mfgabriel92 for pointing it out :). Max, thanks again for all the help and advices you gave to us, contributors. I completely understand you've lost interest maintaining something that you don't use. I can relate to that \ud83d\ude05 \nI'd just like to point out to future maintainer, that UI code may use some good refactoring. Max is world class engineer, but I think lot of contributions to GUI repo were from people (including myself) that were getting started with React couple of years ago. I think the same was with Max, it was learn-new-technology-make-something-useful kind of project, if I'm not wrong :) Backend part should be good, Max got that covered well.\nAll in all, what was supposed to be learn&fun project turned into something really useful and that's true beauty of open source. I know people will mostly see the value in the app they use (Sqlectron), but there's additional value to that. Max helped me, and many others, to get started with Open Source, and technologies there were new to us. Speaking on my behalf, he was very patient teacher and OSS maintainer. I've never felt a bit of annoyance in his replies, no matter how dull my question was. That guy is true Open Source Hero if you ask me. @Github you hear me? :D \nPs. For future maintainer(s): Maybe you could use Open Collective platform for covering part of your expenses?. Are you sure about this one though? Seems better to keep it this way and use native setState method than mutating this.state directly.\nOr were you speaking just of this unnecessary if/else part?\n. @krolow I thinks it's the best to leave it as it is. :+1: for PR :)\n. Sure, will do!\n. Will change that, good catch!\n. There's no need to keep it under dependencies just in case someone wants to switch back. It's better to remove it from package.json and who really wants to use fixed-data-table can easly install it manually.\n. There is no need for this check if you also check it in nested IF statement. Could you please remove upper if and modify line 70 by adding if ( server.ssh && ...). Like Gareth did in his PR before he removed it :)\n. I believe it's all the same in this case. You can leave it as you prefer. :)\n. Hmm, so you wanted to suggest moving JointJS external styles to app.jsx or just above requiring jointjs-diagram elements?\n. This is actually not the same. Your code would contain objects that jQuery returns. I'm using jQuery here because of easier reading checked checkboxes. I guess reading refs of the refs (react way) would be more complicated for only reading which checkbox is selected? Though I agree jQuery way might be replaced for react way of handling checkboxes in database-diagram-modal.jsx\n. After some thinking I think I'll left it as it is (using jQuery). Handling it the react way would require changing states which would trigger on change state component life cycle often, which is unnecessary in this case. Or am I missing something?\n. I'll move styles specific to database diagram to separate .css file and load them after external styles.\n. You're absolutely right! I was bit tired when writing this fix, so I forgot to move it. Good catch :)\n. Pretty long in the standard https://caniuse.com/#search=calc ;). @s-kem I think you'll need to do the same fix for views, procedures etc.. Have you tested it on production databases yet? :)\nI'll test it out on my local dev instance.. Looks alright to me. Please confirm if you have tested on production databases :). ",

    "darkwisperer": "@krolow I will work on it.\n. According to stackoverflow PostgreSQL must have a \"maintenance database\" defined for connection. so this change will only affect MySQL and MS-SQL at this time. \nIt was easy to turn off the error  about missing DB and be able to successfully test a connection by editing 'src/renderer/components/server-modal-form.jsx'. However in the core the SERVER_SCHEMA (src/validators/server.js) has the Database field as required. With this required it prevents adding the connection.  I will be submitting a PR to Core to resolve this in the next few days.\n. @BornaP Thanks for jumping on this! \n. If it is still open after I work on the other tickets I have agreed to I will :)\n. Sounds like it should. I was waiting for a new gui release to confirm this.\n. @maxcnunes no rush :)\nJust happy to help out when/were I can.\n. Issue still persists in v1.6.2\n. Can confirm still an issue in v1.29.0. I like the Mysql Workbench approach of putting the triggers under the tables. Perhaps table related synonyms should also be under the table group or in a description page?\n@maxcnunes  I too like the idea of being able to keep it minimalist, or at least have an option/setting to control what is visible by default. Or on install it asks your preference of either all or minimal then the user can customize from there. Your right this sidebar should be its own issue after a PR has been accepted.\n. in regards to @maxcnunes's example, there is a related issue open for when the connection fails it closes all connections #97. \n. @AndiDog Good catch!\nI can confirm this issue also affects mssql\n. @maxcnunes  This issue is resolved in 1.6.2\nI noticed while installing 1.6.2 that the installer was glitched out and unreadable. Installed fine just noting it.\n. Autocomplete would be amazing!\n. I can confirm this issue on windows 7\n. Can some one else verify?\n. Oh. Yes it is the spinner gif. That gif is a little confusing as to its purpose in the install.\n. Random thought, on sql execute IF SQL string contains keyword \"Create\" then run the refresh menu function. I might be oversimplifying the issue.\ni.e\nif ( string.indexOf('create') > -1 ||  string.indexOf('Create') > -1)\n      refreshLeftMenu();\n. Your right. My idea would have unnecessarily done a refresh. I noticed there are a few AST related npm packages that we might be able to leverage. This is a little over my head, so I'm just going to follow along :)\n. Good idea. node-keytar looks to be a solid choice.\n. Should this issue still be open if we are encrypting the passwords to file per sqlectron/sqlectron-core#43 ?\nor is this feature still wanted?. ",

    "joeblew99": "@BornaP \nThis is awesome. I was thinking about doing type of functionality last week.\nI was wondering if you have thought about how the ERD auto layout works ? Not many people have heard of the concept of \"Crows feet up\" in ERDS, but i have found it to work wel with every DB schema i have worked on. Essentially it means that the things you are referencing are located on the page above the other tables.\nSo any lookup / enum style table like \"Countries\" would be above \"User\" tables, because Users has a FK to Countries.\nThe layout logic needs to counts the FK for each table and the interdependencies, and then it can work out whats above others.\nHorizontal layout i am not sure about. \nThe othr way to do this is totally disregard the auto layout feature, and let devs do it how they like, but to allow saving of the layout.\nIf a new table is added, then it just slapped in the center in front of others. This is what SQL Server does or example ( many moons ago).\n. Sounds good . All of it.\nWhat about saving the view, ? Json format is fine.\nYou could save the view in the a tual dB.\nOn Sun, 12 Jun 2016, 09:56 Borna Perak, notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHey @joeblew99 https://github.com/joeblew99 ,thanks for the feedback.\nThe 'other way' you have mentioned is actually currently implemented (the\nSQL Server way) in the master.

This is fully\nresolved with #192 https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/192 .\nI'm don't think first approach you mentioned would be good in our case as\nit might make use of 'paper' badly, because there might be lots of scroll\nvertically and lot of empty space horizontally. That's why I think its the\nbest to let developers move tables and joints (arrow might be moved around\nthe table and links can be pulled on any point you like).

While a SELECT * takes ~ 3 seconds to execute and render, that seems acceptable enough to me.. I'm taking a stab at fixing this one right now.\nIt appears that the Tab components in use is causing each query component to be entirely unmounted on tab switch, so when you switch back it's re-mounting from scratch and building a default state, which is a scroll position at 0 and a window height at 200.\nI think the simple fix here is to add the forceRenderTabPanel flag to the Tabs component (outlined here: https://github.com/reactjs/react-tabs#forcerendertabpanel-boolean )\nThe drawback there is all the tabs are rendered at all times... which could degrade performance for users with several tabs open, however I'd personally take this trade off (and I frequently use the app with 4+ tabs open and resize them constantly)\nIt was a small change (after a lot of reading docs) to get this working. \nJust added the forceRenderTabPanel flag and then added a unique name for each AceEditor component.\nAn alternative solution (and the first I thought of) is persisting the window height by storing it in the parent query-browser component's state and passing it (and a callback to update) down to the child query\nI don't really like this solution, though. :\\\nI'm went down a rabbit hole right  of trying to persist the scroll position but throwing an onScroll callback on the AceEditor component inside query is never getting called, so I'm not sure it's possible to go down that route and save scroll position.. For the sake of it being mentioned within the sqlectron repository, the problem is in the getTabCount function of the Tabs component in the forked version of react-tabs that sqlectron relies on.\nIt's counting how many children the 0th child of the Tabs component has -- the way query-browser.jsx was written the 0th child is not the list of tabs, but a div with 4 children.\nDue to that, getTabCount was always returning 4, and when we clicked on the 5th tab or beyond, it failed a check in setSelected at if (index < 0 || index >= this.getTabsCount()) return;\n. I'm putting some thought into how to add this.\nMy first thought would be to just store it in the configuration file where the databases are stored, but that looks to be handled by core so my gut feeling is that's shared w/ the cli version.\nMaybe save a new config file where it's just a JSON blob split up by server connection IDs?\nSomething like an array of objects, with [{ serverId: selectedServerId, queries: { ...state.queries} ]]\nThat'll probably get expensive writing every change to disk and state, so would probably want to debounce it, only save to disk on either tab change or query execute or sever disconnect.\nStoring state.queries lets us just load up saved state though for whatever server was selected.. @maxcnunes \nWould you rather I add on to sqlectron.json file or create a separate file to store this data?\nIf the first, then I don't need to submit any changes to sqlectron-core because I can just leverage the config.save function already exposed.\nIf not then I'd need to submit a PR to core to expose the utils file for import into the ui.. How many rows are you getting back when you make this query and what's the number of characters in a typical row?\nMy guess here is that the query is too large and required too much memory so it couldn't be properly parsed.. Good call.\nI changed it to indent by 0.5 em instead of 15px and that seems to cause indentation to just cascade.\n\n. @BornaP While I agree with what you're saying, the app as-is already wraps like that. Nothing in this PR is causing that.\nScreen shot from the live app connecting to the same DB\n\nI'd be happy to look into it in an additional issue/PR but I gave it a quick glance and nothing stood out as immediately obvious to me on a solution.. Fixed that bug I was seeing w/ the tabs -- connection success spawns a new tab, but then it was being overridden right after by setting the cached state and a re-render just wasn't happening -- so I just tied in to the CONNECTION_SUCCESS action for setting the initial state -- it's either a call to addNewQuery or it's the result of spreading initial state w/ the stored values.. How do you feel about storing the result of the queries to disk?\nI just added a commit that removed it.\nMy thought was that would cause the JSON to get potentially way too massive and for someone who uses a lot of tabs would cause pretty long load times when starting the app, especially if they had a couple SELECT * queries open on large databases.. @maxcnunes No problem! Thanks for letting me know.. I did break it but it wasn't that this.refs.queryBoxTextArea.editor.on() function that did it. As far as I can tell it didn't serve a purpose other than to cause UPDATE_QUERY to get double dispatched.\nI was confused as to what selectedQuery was supposed to be within each queryById object, I thought it was supposed to be the currently selected query tab, and didn't notice it's inside each query object.\nI thought it was just not being used to in all cases to pass back the current tab ID, so I made changes to make sure it did. The cmd+enter keyboard shortcut was relying on a different value that was now the query ID.\nI should have undid those changes to start with because they weren't even necessary for the implementation I ended up going with, so I reverted.\nI also caught that I wasn't correctly clearing errors/previous results, so I brought in mapValues from lodash in order to map over each queriesById object and set the result to an empty array and error to null.. Ooohhh, man, I feel so dumb for that. I get why that dispatch was happening now. Also, I didn't even know that was a feature of this app, so that's awesome!\nIn hindsight I would've introduced some unwanted behaviour in saving the state had I not done that. I'm also clearing selectedQuery from each query prior to writing to disk.\nIve reverted removing that code... It wasn't causing an error anymore in my implementation...\nin fact I just squashed all the commits down into one so the history doesn't get messy. Should be fine since nothing else was based on this work yet.\nThanks for your patience in helping me get through it.\nIs there any other data you can think of we shouldn't be saving to disk? I was considering clearing queryHistory so it doesn't balloon up over time... or at least pruning it to say the last 10.\n\nThe restoring state from a database connection that is not the initial one fails.\n\nCan you clarify what you mean by that?\n. > By this quote below, did you mean it will not include the context menu queries?\n\n\nIn hindsight I would've introduced some unwanted behaviour in saving the state had I not done that.\nI believe on MySQL Workbench it restores all tabs, even the empty ones. I think that is a more expected behaviour at least.\n\n\nI should've been clearer there, sorry.\nNow that I actually know what selectedQuery is (the hilighted text), I noticed if I hilighted a statement, hit cmd+enter to execute it, quit the app and re-opened, selectedQuery was still the statement I had previously hilighted, but I wasn't restoring the hilighting.\nSo if I had two statements:\nSELECT * FROM roles;\nSELECT * FROM users;\nand I hilighted the first and ran it, then I only execute the first. When re-opening the app, nothing is hilighted but when I execute it would only be executing the first.\nSo I need to do one of two things:\n\nFigure out how to restore the hilighting in the UI\nClear selectedQuery so executing will just execute the whole block and let the user hilight a specific query again\n\nI opted for 2 since it felt easier.\nOn the other bug,  I fully understand it now, it's outside my normal workflow in the app so I forgot all about testing that.\nFixing that was a big challenge.\nI re-set ConnActions.connect back to what it was before... I initially tied into it since itw as the first action that runs.\nInstead I added a new action, ConnActions.restoreStoredQueries which takes a server id as a param.\nI updated QueryBrowser to dispatch that on componentWillMount instead of the connect action. This new action grabs the stored state and loops through each database tabs were open for and dispatches connect for each of them.\nIn the event that there's no stored state it just dispatches connect for the passed in id, which will then connect to the default database.\nTo get around the componentWillReceiveProps in QueryBrowser navigating me back to / when I restored query, I had to have the reducer for connection set connecting to true when dispatching SET_STORED_QUERIES -- this seemed the simplest way to ensure it knew connections were pending, because SET_STORED_QUERIES would dispatch before any CONNECTION_REQUEST actions due to the async calls in the connect function.\n~~I appear to have introduced a bug where now the database list on the left is empty when restoring, and I'm seeing some databases listing tables that don't actually exist on them. I'm investigating it now.~~\nFixed that bug -- I wasn't ever dispatching with isServerConnection which is what all those initial fetches are based on.\nTo fix that I just have the connect function take a final param that is isServerConnection and make it true for the first connection I make.\nI also wasn't correctly opening a new tab when connecting to a new table which was causing the app to fetch tables and schemas for the wrong database. Fixed that by checking if I have any open tabs for a database when the CONNECTION_SUCCESS action goes through the reducer and spawning a new tab if needed.. I added a commit fixing the first -- Any reason you think that change might break something else?\nI seem to be calling back the correct tables when opening a brand new connection (as the app currently does) as well as calling back the correct tables on all databases I'm opening when restoring previous state.\nI think the rational for the original line was the currentQueryId when that function would fire was always the newly spawned tab, but when restoring I'd need the tables for both.\nOn the first issue...\nUltimately I need to just know that I deleted the last tab and write back to the disk that the lastCreatedId is now 0 again...\nI think this is a symptom of the app just incrementing the counter even after deleting the last tab.\nFor example if I just hit the \"x\" over and over on the live app, the counter in the tab increases with each newly spawned tab.\nChanging it to default back to 0 when deleting the last tab would fix that... I'll push a commit on that and see how you feel about it.. Hey @BornaP , sorry, been a crazy week.\nI did test it out on my work databases and it appears to be loading the data as needed, but most of them didn't have anything to fill out all the categories anyway.\nLet me know if you can think of anything else this needs.. I wonder if it's an electron thing. I'm running on OSX High Sierra but I can check the previous code on my Windows machine.\nCurious why it wasn't working, but since I started contributing I've never been able to get actions to drop down so I could see the prev/next state or the action object.. @haivp3010 I'm seeing a couple things here...\nquery-result-table ends up inheriting props.widthOffset from query-browser's state.sideBarWidth. Even when the sidebar is collapsed, the state is still the actual width of the sidebar, so it's still offsetting by that value.\nA ternary around line 514 on the widthOffset prop sent to Query fixes it -- widthOffset={this.state.sidebarCollapsed ? 0 : this.state.sideBarWidth}\nSimply setting sideBarWidth to 0 on onCollapseClick seems to disable your collapsing, I assume due to your use of negative margin.\nHowever this only works when you collapse the sidebar first and then execute the query. It appears there's also an overall re-rendering issue in query-result-table not re-rendering when props.widthOffset changes. I'm noticing the table not resizing when I drag resize the sidebar.. I made a PR, #395 that solves the re-render issue. As long as you're passing a 0 offset down when collapsing the sidebar it should cause either a re-render or a recompute of the grid size to happen.. Good catch on being safe and removing the listeners on unmount.\nIMO there's no need for two functions that do the same thing, nor is there a reason for that function to live within the React class. There's no reason to use this.someFunction() if someFunction doesn't actually need to know about this -- That is to say, the functions never actually refer to this.\nconst preventDefault = e => e.preventDefault(); at the top of the file, outside the scope of the class and\n``` jsx\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.props.dispatch(ConfigActions.loadConfig());\n    document.addEventListener('dragover', preventDefault, false);\n    document.addEventListener('drop', preventDefault, false);\n  }\n// will receieve props goes here...\ncomponentWillUnmount() {\n    document.removeEventListener('dragover', preventDefault, false);\n    document.removeEventListener('drop', preventDefault, false);\n  }\n```\nis cleaner imo. I've experimented w/ lodash throttle with onResize to only setState every 150 ms or so but it's still not resizing as smoothly as it does with just using onResizeStop. I'm not sure what the purpose of this was, but by removing it I removed a duplicate dispatch of the UPDATE_QUERY action on every key press, and solved an issue where I wasn't loading the correct query.query into the AceEditor pane per tab.. You're probably right. I added a commit for that. I'll test it tomorrow on my production databases which have some views and triggers across different databases. My personal dev machine just has the docker instances. I should probably add some views and functions to those so I can catch things like this.. ",

After some works, I got some good successes, but we might need to adjust more custom components.\nThis is the commit I have: https://github.com/synle/sqlectron-gui/commit/2ffea8a618c52860eab2eafccaf13075924a7a1e\nI'll go deeper into the individual component and make them dark theme complied.\n\n\n\n\n. Guys, I took a stab at it and here is my first PR for dark theme improvements.\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/408\n@maxcnunes @alexmylonas . Look like he is talking about the TRAILING SPACE in the result table after we collapse the sidebar. I can re-pro the issue as well, this should be a fairly straight forward bug to fix.\nI am out of town, but can look into this issue when I am back home.\n\n. I also found a few UI defects when you resize the app window.\nLook like the headers row is resized, but the result item rows does not get resized at all.\n\n. This could be a great bug for me to get started. \n1. How do we treat these merges since we have a few values that might attribute to empty string?\n\nNULL value\nReal Empty String or '' value\nAn string filled with empty spaces\n\nShould we merge them all as one?\n2. I think this feature should be added as a feature flag in the setting page.. Look like it could be a logic issue in the duplicate code.\nAfter duplicate, the number of server is still showing up as 3 (instead of 4) like in this example...\n\nLook like things is correct up until this save operation in the server reducer...\n\nI saw we used .push, but that doesn't change the object itself. Should we use concat instead of at least add custom logics for shouldComponentUpdate\nshouldComponentUpdate: function(nextProps, nextState){\n    // return a boolean value\n    return true;\n}. After some diggings, I found that the routine we use to find the servers is not correct.\nWe looked at at config (for some reasons it's out of sync)\nconst server = getState().config.data.servers.find(srv => srv.id === id);\nWhereas we should use this value instead...\nconst server = getState().servers.items.find(srv => srv.id === id);. Created a PR for this, PR link is here https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/410. Look like this issue also appears in RECENTLY CREATED CONNECTIONS.. The fix should be pushed already in #410 .\nWhat I did is to reload the config after save and after duplication. PR merged, closing out. Hold up, looks like there are some encryptions / decryptions not being set properly in servers.items compared with config.data.servers\n\n. Nvm, I think data within servers.items might have been decrypted already. This should work.. Don't merge this yet. I think I found a bigger issue with our encryption and decryption logics when DUPLICATING, and UPDATING servers.\nThey don't work. Try to duplicate ABC, to ABC1, then ABC1 to ABC2, the encrypted passwords are not properly copied over, the same thing is true for Trying to edit / update the same connections multiple times.. Look like the logic to encrypt passwords is encapsulated in the core library sqlectron-core and not exported.\nSo we might not be able to use servers.items directly.\nThere are some logics deep inside sqlectron-core that makes it a little harder to do this.\nI am looking into an option to completely reload the config after save and duplications. Okay guys, I finally ended up with the RELOAD after SAVING and after DUPLICATING path.\nI think it's a safer path and solution to this problem and won't cause any interference with the core library in encryption and decryption.\nLet me know if you guys have any issue here.. Thanks for pointing to the code. Will send PR when I have a functional code.. @maxcnunes I wonder if you guys have pre-defined sets of docker images you guys used for testing out different database engines / clients?\nIf not, I can setting them up myself.. It might be hard for the implementation since Azure Table doesn't have a plain text SQL Query.. After some research, Microsoft does have a plain SQL query support for CosmoDB.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sql-query\nAzure CosmoDB can be set up locally, instructions can be found here.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator\nReopened.. Pushed the PR for this, it can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/pull/414\n. Fixed the lint error and pushed...\n. This should work now. Let me know if you guys find any issue with this.. I thought about it, maybe we can extend bookmarking to databases and even tables.\nAlso we can also save favorite queries. So this way, we can quickly get to connections, databases and querties. This is the main style for dark theme. Due to some issues with contrast in the Toggle Checkbox, I need to add some outlines here.. Also I upgraded Semantic UI css to the latest . ",

    "jleclanche": "Dupe of #296. @maxcnunes Well like I was saying in #329 this affects Amazon Redshift as well (the amazon version of bigquery). Redshift was forked from Postgres 8.0, so speaks postgres 8.x. Having it available even as a separate driver or some such would be really nice.. @maxcnunes I figured out the issue.\nThe results array is being filled with fields and rows, but the rowCount is null. So in executeQuery, if you do something like this:\n```js\n  // Remove any \"reference\" to the remote IPC object\n  const results = cloneDeep(remoteResult);\n  results[0].rowCount = results[0].rows.length;\n\n```\nThen that works fine. Of course it's not the correct fix, the rowCount shouldn't be null in the first place, that happens in -core. Looking at postgresql.js:\n```js\nfunction parseRowQueryResult(data, command) {\n  const isSelect = data.command === 'SELECT';\n  return {\n    command: command || data.command,\n    rows: data.rows,\n    fields: data.fields,\n    rowCount: isSelect ? data.rowCount : undefined,\n    affectedRows: !isSelect && !isNaN(data.rowCount) ? data.rowCount : undefined,\n  };\n}\n```\ndata.rowCount comes from the pg lib. I suspect the best fix would be to ensure it's set correctly in pg, but I don't know what exactly is going on for it not to work properly and I'm not familiar enough with the postgres protocol to dig into it further. However, in the mean time, changing the `rowCount above to the following will probably fix it:\njs\nrowCount: isSelect ? (data.rowCount || data.rows.length) : undefined. > Or maybe \ud83e\udd1e one day amazon will update redshift to use the postgres@9.x binary protocol and then we'll all be better.\nTell me about it!! I'm not getting my hopes up though.\nGlad you like sqlectron; I just found it yesterday as well and I'm pretty psyched about it, it looks like it could definitely use some contributions :). https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core/pull/45 should fix this issue.. I'll keep reporting issues if I come across more. For the time being I mostly need read access to redshift.\nI suspect tests might be more sensitive to changes to the protocol from 8->9 than clients are; most clients seem to support 8.0 (as in redshift) just fine, including psql 9.6.\nThe only issue I know of, that showed up in pgadmin4 and that seems to have shown up in a few other clients (but not sqlectron) is a spurious error on startup: ERROR: permission denied to set parameter \"client_min_messages\" to \"notice\".. For what it's worth it looks like Electron does use xdg by default:\n```\n[23:52:43] adys@azura ~ % tree .config/Sqlectron         \n.config/Sqlectron\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 GPUCache\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 data_0\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 data_1\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 data_2\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 data_3\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Local Storage\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Preferences\n2 directories, 6 files\n[23:52:48] adys@azura ~ % cat .config/Sqlectron/Preferences\n{\"brightray\":{\"media\":{\"device_id_salt\":\"2Hlo3B4A93z19AYKToAdzg==\"}}}\n```\nI'm guessing there's probably an API you can use .... https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/app/#appgetpathname. It happened the very first few times I used sqlectron, before I even added a db. However I can't get it to reproduce anymore but that might be because I upgraded to the latest version... I was one version behind before.. Sorry, that's #323.. There's nothing that prevents desktop apps from having a --version flag :) It's good practice.\n[14:13:00] adys@azura ~ % pcmanfm --version\npcmanfm 0.11.3\n[14:13:07] adys@azura ~ % keepassxc --version\nkeepassxc 2.2.0\n[14:13:10] adys@azura ~ % chromium --version\nChromium 61.0.3163.100 \n[14:13:17] adys@azura ~ % discord --version\nDiscord 0.0.2\n. BTW this is super useful for maintainers.. It's a boolean, although a redshift one so I don't know the implication there (Postgres 8.0). @maxcnunes Interesting, thanks.\nOn that note, have you thought about switching to the vscode syntax highlight / language library? Here are some resources:\n\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/language-support\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-language-server\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers\n\nIt'd be a pretty big project, but it could be interesting. The vscode language infrastructure supports syntax highlighting, validation, snippets and autocompletion, all of it over a well defined generic protocol. I wonder what the tooling is for SQL there.... \n;). It's interesting to see that all postgres-specific syntax highlight definitions resolve to this old file:\nhttps://github.com/mulander/postgres.tmbundle/blob/master/Syntaxes/PL%20pgSQL%20(Postgres).tmLanguage\nEdit: Or for the ones that don't use textmate, this one.

There's literally no way to get it out of the protocol w/o counting rows returned AFAIK w/ postgres@8.x (including redshift).  \nI think @jleclanche's suggestion to check data.rows.length on the result is a safe way to go. You could even do rowCount: (data.rowCount || (data.rows || 0).length) which should always work and be future-proof if node-postgres ever decided to not allocate arrays of rows automatically on results of queries which return no rows.\nOr maybe :crossed_fingers: one day amazon will update redshift to use the postgres@9.x binary protocol and then we'll all be better.\nI'm glad I found this lib though - definitely going to install it & use it when I'm developing apps. psql is nice, but it is 2017 after all. :smile: .

    "barneydmedia": "There is a new build out, and I plan on taking a look at some of the other issues. I would like to see the project continue, personally. . I think it would be cool, and I think it would be a good thing. I also think it would be a lot of work and could potentially split the codebase in consequential ways. \nI'm not able to do it, but I also wouldn't be against someone else making an effort on a separate fork to later add/merge. I would also love to see more users and contributors here.. I don't think I have access to do that. Sorry if I'm missing something obvious.. @maxcnunes Thanks for adding me, I'll work on getting a new build up sometime this week.. @maxcnunes I don't have an Apple dev account, so I can't sign the binary. I may get one in the future, but for now I'm just going to keep fixing bugs. Let me know if I can do anything else to help.. @maxcnunes I ran through the guide, but the build failed. From what I can tell in the log, it looks like the build just got hung up on downloading one of the assets or maybe binaries from AWS. Is there a way to restart the build and try again? . @maxcnunes I wasn't able to see the button, but the rebuild you triggered completed successfully. I published the build and sent the PR to update the homebrew version.. @krolow Could you assign a reviewer for this one too?. I agree that this should be a feature. I would also like to see something similar for adding/editing columns in a table. Hopefully we can make this happen in the future.. I'm not able to reproduce this on the latest docker mysql image, but I've seen this issue before. \nThe more recent versions of MySQL use different auth plugins by default, and unfortunately it looks like the mysqljs and mysql2 don't support it yet. This isn't something this project can address directly, so we have to wait for fixes to one of those packages.\nThe good news that I can give is that there are workarounds, mostly configuring MySQL to use the older auth systems by default. I'll leave this issue open until we can bring in a fix but I'll close duplicates.. Minor update on this, there is a PR for the mysql adapter that fixes this problem by adding in new auth compatibility. Once it's completed and merged in we can we can update the package dependency here and release a new build.\nhttps://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/pull/1962. I think you're confusing SQL with query builder behaviors. When you're executing the query directly (like with SQLectron), you just plugin in whatever the value is.\nselect name from person where id = 1;\nselect name from person where id in (1,2,3,4). I believe this is a duplicate of #442 which I plan to look into soon.. Unfortunately SQLectron doesn't currently support other languages. If you're able to add that feature and send a PR, that would great and probably appreciated by a lot of users. . Pretty sure they're the locale files included with Electron. Electron supports locale lookups and you can add translation files so that the app can use different languages. Unfortunately, no one has done any of the work to take advantage of those features.. I don't think it's a bug, it's just an advanced feature that SQLectron doesn't currently support. \nFrom what I understand, a delimiter can't be set when being passed in as a query (like SQLectron does) and we would need to set up something different to handle it. You can learn more from this SO question: https://stackoverflow.com/a/10259528/3200999. I started looking into this but have had a really busy month, I hope to get back to it soon.. I think this would be pretty cool. What steps are needed for updating the package once it's listed there?. This is actually a bug with this projects mysql driver. We're waiting on the package to be updated and unfortunately can't do much about it until it is, although it is being worked on. See #442 for more info.. ",

Which as discussed on their blog, is outdated, insecure and slow. Real solution would be to update drivers which use latest sha2 password plugin to connect to the server.. "
