Thanks for your contribution.\nI would have preferred to keep the existing code for 2.3+ and use the compatible code for < 2.3\nWhat I mean is to test the SDK version in order choose the right code. \n. There is no point in supporting < 2.1 (look at the repartition http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html)\n. It's a good idea to have themes.

MariuszGSL is right. There is a specific layout in landscape mode. Works like a charm on my gnex so your issue must be specific on your device.\n. @ericcarboni can you please post a screenshot ?\n. Do you still have an issue on this?\n. @DineshAnandan please take a look on the example. There is a good way to do it.\n@marcusforsberg I'm sorry but I can't reproduce your problem... what's the app?\n@MariuszGSL can you try with the latest version?\n. @marcusforsberg it looks like you have the landscape layout in portrait mode and the portrait layout in landscape mode ...\n@MariuszGSL can you please try with the latest version?\n. @MariuszGSL \n- support v4 library is needed because we want to backport the picker on 2.1+\n- date_picker_selected_date.xml is the same as https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/datetimepicker/+/master/res/layout/date_picker_selected_date.xml\nWhat are the compilation issues?\n. Unfortunatly, no time to work on ... I hope starting in a couple of days. \n. Good idea. I'm going to focus on this asap\n. Try this https://github.com/flavienlaurent/datetimepicker/raw/master/datetimepicker-library.aar\n. Do you know TimePicker is open source? \n. I didn't start anything on TimePicker. It may be interesting to backport to 2.1+ and to make it more customizable\n. Be more explicit\n. yes go-ahead\n. Thanks ! I check your pull request this day.\n. If others ask for it, I will think again about it.\n. If you have some stacktrace. That d be great\n. Do you have some custom testing situation?\n. Rooted device, ROM custom? Language?\n. What's red toggles details?\n. Not Resource Found on what? It must be on a specific attribute.\nFor your second issue, you have more details in Eclipse logs.\n. great, thanks!\n. great thanks!\n. @edisonw is right.

Thanks\n. What is the problem ?\n. I don't understand well what you want to do.\nAnyway, the TimePicker must be a time picker not a duration picker if it is what you want to do.\n.

    "MariuszGSL": "My phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 2) was already set to the correct locale (English New Zealand). I have also tried English (Australia) with the same effect: the calendar week still starts on Sunday.\nI then downloaded the app \"Locale Select\" and changed it to English (Belgium) and got it working !\nI wonder why the English NZ and Australia locales do not work ?  We certainly use our calendars here with Monday as the first day of the week (unlike in the US).\nIs there another way to force this calendar date picker to permanently show the weeks starting on Monday ?\nFor example, the Samsung S Planner app has an internal setup switch to change the First day of the week setting for its calendar. Most likely all local (NZ/Australia) users will have the same problem with the default locale.\nP.S. Thank you Gabriel for this reply. I was inspired by your beautiful and clean Timetable app and chose this particular date picker for my application.\nBy the way: Your Timetable application date picker has the same locale problem.  \n. Thank you. The new feature/switch works perfectly well.\n. Thanks. I have actually done exactly that, before I sent my original query.\nBut I thought there might be another more \"elegant\" way to disable Vibrate.\nNo doubt, you have done the same in your Timetable app ?\nBy the way: how did you mange to get the colours for the selected month+date to always show in blue in your application DUE-DATE selector ?\n. Thank you. The new switch works very well.\n. Thank you. The fix works very well.\n. On my phone, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, the date picker adjusts itself perfectly in landscape mode, with the two sections placed correctly side by side. The Done button is visible, no problems.\nHowever, I have not tested it on any other devices or different screen sizes.\nYou need to be specific about the device you are using, when reporting these types of issues. \n. I also use Sony Xperia Z tablet with Android 4.2.2 and cannot replicate the problems with switching the DateTimePicker from landscape to portrait and vice versa. Works perfectly in my application and in other applications that use this component.  \nKeep in mind that I have not updated to the latest DateTimePicker code since 7 July 2013, when some critical code changes have been made.\n. @flavienlaurent  I have tried to replace my old datepicker library (from July 2013) in Eclipse with the new one without success. I am getting compilation errors and cannot get it working. \nI had to reverse back to the earlier library from July after several hours of struggle. \nI needed to do the following changes in the original (July) datepicker library code before compiling:\n1. in DatePickerDialog.java   replaced import android.support.v4.app.DialogFragment with\nimport android.app.DialogFragment\n\n2. in layout date_picker_selected_date.xml  changed the order of day and month (swapped them around to have the date appear above the month).\nAlso made the same (#1) change in the new module TimePickerDialog.java\nPlease suggest the best, simplest, full proof method to replace the library code with the new one, in order to test it for you.\n. @raymondlam  Yes, I have copied both libraries from the old Datetimepicker project and tried to compile it without success.\nI don't actually need the support v4 library, as I do not want to use it in my main project. I need to have the \nimport android.support.v4.app.DialogFragment removed from the DatePickerDialog.java code and replaced with android.app.DialogFragment.\nI will explore the gradle and see if this will make a difference.\nThe July version of datetimepicker works perfectly well in my main project on all devices I have tested it and I have no need for the timepicker module.  I also don't want to waste several more hours trying to fight the compilation of the updated library code.\n. ",

That is likely why you didn't have a reference to the support Dialog Fragment. The libraries used to be included in the github but now they have been removed. If you aren't using gradle, you'll need to add them back manually.\n. I've created a pull request #30 with the ability to set the date range.\n. @flavienlaurent I've never had problems with having no constructors. The android docs do not include the constructor, http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DialogFragment.html.\nI thought that the empty constructor used in the example was just a reminder to people incase they overload the constructor. By default, if there are no constructors, the default constructor should provide the same effect as an empty constructor. If there is an overloaded constructor, no default constructor will be created so they need to explicitly include a no-parameter constructor so that it can be re-created by the system.\nI was just curious if there were any specific cases where having no constructors would cause an error.\nBut that point aside, we can leave the constructors as in as there is no harm.\n.

    "kmlkrk": "I implemented this great picker yesterday without issues. I used that for date range:\ndatePickerDialog.setYearRange(1985, 2028);\nIn my case I only wanted current year and the next 15 years so I did something like:\ndatePickerDialog.setYearRange(calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR), calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR) + 15);\nBeware that when I tried setting date range to 30 years in the future it crashed. 20 years was fine. I settled for 15.\n. Vibrate works for me on HTC One M7 but it is very short, almost unnoticeable vibration, which I actually like. Thank you so very much for putting this all together!\n. According to documentation:\npublic static com.sleepbot.datetimepicker.time.TimePickerDialog newInstance(com.sleepbot.datetimepicker.time.TimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener callback, int hourOfDay, int minute, boolean is24HourMode, boolean vibrate) { /* compiled code */ }\nFor AM/PM use:\nfinal TimePickerDialog timePickerDialog = TimePickerDialog.newInstance(this, calendar.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) ,calendar.get(Calendar.MINUTE), false, false); \nFor 24 hour clock:\nfinal TimePickerDialog timePickerDialog = TimePickerDialog.newInstance(this, calendar.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) ,calendar.get(Calendar.MINUTE), true, false);\nThis worked for me!\n. If timeIs24h && hourInt > 12 then hourInt -= 12\nI can  elaborate when I'm back at my computer. I'm writing from phone \n. Here is a function that I wrote about year and a half ago when I had very little Android development experience. Notice that it relies on some variables that are set in my class such as this.hourInt, this.isTime24Hours etc. But it should give you an idea how to format a string manually. Another option is utilizing class SimpleDateFormat but to make it work you may need to use timestamp.\nHere is manual conversion:\n```\n    public String getTimeString() {\n    String timeString, ampm;\n    int tempHourInt = this.hourInt; //create a copy so that I don't change the original hour stored in object\n\n    //create time\n    if (this.isTime24Hours) {\n        timeString = (tempHourInt < 10 ? \"0\" + tempHourInt : tempHourInt) + \":\" + (this.minuteInt < 10 ? \"0\" + this.minuteInt : this.minuteInt);\n    }\n    else {\n        //check if 12 or greater\n        if (tempHourInt >= 12) {\n            //if greater than 12 then subtract 12 (will not subtract of hour is something like 12:34 PM)\n            if (tempHourInt > 12) {\n                tempHourInt -= 12;\n            }\n            ampm = \"PM\";\n        }\n        else {\n            if (tempHourInt == 0) {\n                tempHourInt = 12;\n            }\n            ampm = \"AM\";\n        }\n\n        timeString = (tempHourInt < 10 ? \"0\" + tempHourInt : tempHourInt) + \":\" + (this.minuteInt < 10 ? \"0\" + this.minuteInt : this.minuteInt) + \" \" + ampm;\n    }\n\n    return timeString;\n}\n\n```\nHERE IS BETTER CONVERSION that uses timestamp\n```\n    public String getTimeString() {\n        Date d = new Date();\n        SimpleDateFormat timeFormatter;\n        Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();\n        c.setTimeInMillis(timestamp);\n    if (this.isTime24Hours) {\n        timeFormatter = new SimpleDateFormat(\"HH:mm\", Locale.getDefault());     //23:24\n    }\n    else {\n        timeFormatter = new SimpleDateFormat(\"h:mm a\", Locale.getDefault());    //11:23 AM\n    }\n\n    c.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, this.hourInt);\n    c.set(Calendar.MINUTE, this.minuteInt);\n\n    long newTimestamp = c.getTimeInMillis();\n\n    d.setTime(newTimestamp);\n\n    String timeString = timeFormatter.format(d);\n    return timeString;\n}\n\n```\nPS. I just gave away something that took me weeks to figure out and optimize. All I am asking for in return is that you help someone else once you learn more about programming!\n. @chrisonline is right. I am currently using this library in a project that is backwards compatible to Android 2.3 without any issues. Pickers work and look beautiful even in Gingerbread.\n. I searched for the same thing few months ago and it didn't look easy or\npossible. I switched to android studio and love it. Give it a shot. It is\npretty easy to convert your project.
