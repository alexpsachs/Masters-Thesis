Hello All,\nWhen this issue raised in the first place, I didn't want to respond quickly, I was surprised and I waited for your comments and ideas...  First of all, i just started this project as a contribution to Meteorjs community and I am still thinking on that way...\nI knew that the first version of project name \"Metrello\" sounds problematic but I never thought it would be problem for Trello, their mission and millions of users on that time. \nLet me summarize the timeline:\nWhen I deploy metrello.meteor.com, I received an email from Trello, on that email they asked us to change the name and the logo and put a disclaimer that tells people \"We are not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by or in any way officially connected to Trello, Inc. (www.trello.com).\"  \nAfter that, we have changed the name to \"Libreboard\", changed the logo and put the disclaimer on our page.\nNow the CSS issue is really bugging us,  If they told us in the first place we could respond quickly and do the necessary development.\nAnd also I am really sad to see developers are talking against us just for bunch of CSS files, ignoring many kinds of effort on that project, instead of contributing us to change the UI and making it the best open source kanban board.\nSincerely yours,\nYasar\n. @MichaelBanks :+1: \n. @mquandalle I agree with you.\n. @BatuhanK @xsuperbug bildirimleriniz i\u00e7in te\u015fekk\u00fcr ederiz. \n@xsuperbug yetki olay\u0131 public olan board larda full olmas\u0131 gerekiyor zaten .

    "mquandalle": "@wuxianliang, we now have even cleaner stylesheets #56!\n. I am personally fine with gravatar support, and would be happy to merge your code @alireza-ahmadi. Maybe we can use https://github.com/bengott/meteor-avatar which implement gravatar along with other features. \n. Implemented.\n. Closing in favor of #216.\n. Even if it need some improvements, this is implemented in production so let's close this issue.\n@lqtox We use GridFS, which is supported in all environments where we have a mongo database. If you really want S3 (why?!) please open a new thread and we may consider giving the option to the end-user.\n. @JamborJan I plan to release v0.8 release-candidate on Saturday, and the final release early next week, and I'll generate a new sandstorm package for each of them.\n. @JamborJan The sandstorm app has been upgraded ;-)\n. This is fixed in v0.9 (at least on IE11, haven't tried lower versions).\n. @yasaricli, Why did you re-open this? It seems fixed.\n. Also, on the when the focus is on the \u201cadd a comment\u201d textarea, Maj+Enter should post the comment.\n. Seems identical to #2\n. It seems that we are rendering the all board again every time we open a card. This is bad because:\n- it's not efficient at all\n- we loose some state information on the board, like columns scrolling position\nI think iron-router regions can provide a working solution for this problem.\n. Here is a hacky fix.\n. Fixed in 5d43a5f61d777542eddcfdbca1765048268981fa\n. Yes, but a commit (8d2f687464660b35103b14856a8e33db2273b55d) broke this feature again.\nAnyway I plan to refactor this welcome board with the following goals in mind:\n1. Have a board that explains the project\n2. Have it available in the user language\n3. Displayed in the home page (if the user is not connected)\n4. Copied into the user board list when a user create a new account\n. The home page definitely need a lot of work (which in a way is not too bad, because it slow down adoption while we're implementing new features like crazy!). Yes, you can open a new issue about it :-)\n. Yes, we would like to support this feature.\n. Not sure what was the problem, but it seems to be fixed on master.\n@iraycd I'll ping you when this is deployed so you can verify if the issue is effectively fixed.\n. I'm seeing this bug again in production.\n. Related: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1253\n. Yes, the popup system needs to be improved. I plan to make a general object that we can use more easily (there is a lot of duplicate code related to click management for instance). And there is also #54.\nAbout the implementation we can simply add an event listener on the body that will close the popup. Then we add a click event on the popup and stop its propagation so that the event does not bubble up to the body tag.\n. Yes, I've seen the issue. Travis is configured with @yasaricli personal account, so I guess I can't do anything for the moment.\n. I believe there are some copyright issues \u2014 http://designshack.net/design/pigeon\n. I wanted to make this announcement in due form at the v0.9 release time, but I will share my idea now (2am here in France :)) in favour of saving everyone's time. Here is the thing, I would like to re-brand the project from \u201cLibreBoard\u201d to \u201cWekan\u201d.\nYasar the originally author of this application originally named it Metrello because it was a Trello clone made in Meteor. Trello wasn't happy with that and asked us to rename the project. I first thought of \"OpenBoard\" (because well, it's an open-source board) but because the dot com domain name was already taken, I replaced the word \u201cOpen\u201d by \u201cLibre\u201d which is free as in freedom in some Latin derived languages (including French). The whole naming process took something like 10 minutes.\nIt turns out this name is pretty difficult to remember (when I talk to some people about this project, they always forget how it was called), pretty long to type on a keyboard, and I've seen quite a few people on reddit/twitter (and also #sandstorm IRC if I recall correctly) that says we should stop naming our project \"LibreSomething\".\nI think that my proposition, Wekan, is shorter to type and more memorable (of course if you are used to the name LibreBoard you may dislike it :)). This name includes both the idea of collaboration \"We\" on a \"Kan\"ban software. I also bought this logo:\n\nThe slogan/catchphrase could be something like \u201cWekan \u2014 organize anything\u201d\nAny feedback about this re-branding idea? If people don't like it, I can very well change my mind. Also about the logo I'm open to alternatives, especially since I currently don't have a good \u201csquare icon\u201d.\nOf course the project will stay open-source, just because Firefox isn't called LibreBrowser doesn't mean it is not free as in freedom :)\n. Also @neynah, I really like all your work :-) The re-branding is not a blocker, I could publish at least a beta under current LibreBoard name using either option 1 or 2.\nAnd yes the current pigeon logo is an obvious copyright infringement \u2014 I removed it from the repository before going back to GitHub.\n. That's super kind to you N\u00e9na, I sent you the AI source on a sandstorm grain. And if you have a genius idea, please share :-)\n. This is indeed very cool @neynah :-) Would that concept work with the Wekan name?\n. Awesome N\u00e9na, I'll merge the wekan logo as part of the upcoming re-branding (by the way I'm dubious we had the right to use the Libreboard font).\nI'm also in a rush to fix remaining bugs, but that will be ready for the Sandstorm app market launch.\nThank you very much :)\n. Yes. I'll probably re-brand tomorrow.\n. Done.\n. This is fixed in the new-ui branch.\n. This issue is about implementing the per board background color, @yasaricli plan to work on this on Sunday. Personally I'm also interested in a new palette to visually distinguish from Trello. Maybe http://flatuicolors.com?\n. Probably a bug with https://github.com/yasaricli/meteor-slugify\n. This is fixed on master and on http://libreboard.com. Thank you for the bug report and for your article :-)\nWould you be interested in translating the application in Japanese ?\n. Oh, if you want to participate in the translatin please use https://www.transifex.com/organization/libreboard/dashboard/libreboard. That would be easier for us to manage than individual PRs.\n. Thank you for the suggestion, good idea!\n. I'm in favor of \u201cone-click\u201d - or more generally \u201csimple\u201d - installation for all platforms where some users will want to run LibreBoard on. That's why we added Sandstorm support (one click installation on your own machine), and we plan to add docker signed images. I never used Heroku (or docker based open alternatives like Dokku or Deis) but IIRC we need to write a \u201cbuildpack\u201d, is that correct? I imagine we could take advantage of using meteor here, since we really don't do anything fancy a buildpack for a standard meteor application should work for LibreBoard.\nAs tagged, PR encouraged!\n. Now it is!\n. I don't have deploy privilege on metrello.meteor.com, @yasaricli could you please deploy a new meteor application containing a single with file the following code:\njs\nif (Meteor.isServer) {\n  WebApp.connectHandlers.use(function(req, res) {\n    res.writeHead(301, { 'Location': 'http://libreboard.com' });\n    res.end();\n  });\n}\n. Thank you very much @yasaricli \n. Sorry for that, we are moving fast and breaking things... This is fixed now (and deployed).\n. I'm not sure what would be the expected user experience here? If you filter on the blue label, and add a new card without this blue label, do you expect it do be visible in the filtered view? Or maybe we can just disable the \u201cadd a new card\u201d link?\n. I agree with you, but in another way the user will also be confused if he tries to add a card and the \u201cadd a card\u2026\u201d link has disappeared. So we need to write something like \u201cDisable filtering to add new cards\u201d.\nOr we can just follow what Trello does and not filter newly created cards.\n. Hum this is strange. When you published this issue 4 hours ago I directly tried on my local instance and there was no bug, then I tried on the deployed instance and the bug was here. So I thought it was a problem of latency, or something like that.\nBut I just re-deployed the same commit again, and now it works in production. So maybe it was a mistake on my side (I deployed the wrong branch), but I don't think so because the deployed instance included the last commit I did, or maybe someone else (@yasaricli?) did deploy during the interval...\nAnyway, it is \"fixed\" in both local and remote environments, so I'm closing this issue. Thank you for your will to help.\n. This time it is different, I effectively introduced a bug. It's fixed now.\n. I cannot reproduce this issue, maybe it is a similar story as #81?\n. Oh ok, I tested the wrong functionality (removing a member by the action button on the detailled view). Tagging this as a bug.\n. I think I have found the issue: https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/blob/13dc98266535a1b4fa339dcbc55ecbf486395f22/client/views/cards/events.js#L65  ^^\n. I cannot reproduce this bug. Could you provide more details?\n. I imagine we can improve the user experience here.\n. Fixed in 6db01bb3c7bbcf3e5451dd828d3d0932eb5efec3.\n. I will implement this along with the new UI. But it's certainly not a \u201c15 minutes fix\u201d ;-)\n. I don't think this is a behavior we want to encourage. If you want to delete a card you have to explicitly click on a \u201cdelete\u201d button somewhere in the UI. Do you think it would be a good idea if file systems implemented a \u201crename this file to blank to delete its content\u201d. How do you retrieve the original name if you have done this by mistake?\nWhat I plan to implement is a \u201cdrag here to archive\u201d when you are dragging a card. I think that would solve this issue in a better way.\n. This is implemented in the current master branch and will be shipped in v0.9 release.\n. @blessenm LibreBoard is a web application using the classical client-server architecture. What do you want to do? Install the LibreBoard server on a windows machine? Wrap the client application into a exe file? Or something else?\nThis project is very young (version number 0.7), and we are totally aware of lack of good documentation (and lack of tests, and lack of certain features, and performances...), we'll improve that over time.\n. @neandrake Thank you very much for this great tutorial! Even for a completely manual installation like the one who did there are some things we could improve, for instance you shouldn't need to download meteor because we provide the builded nodejs application (for the last version). I imagine we should also update the build script.\nIt would be very cool if you mind copy your post in a new wiki page.\nPS: I've seen all the issues you posted, thank you the very detailed explanations. As you can see on the commit I already fixed some of them :-)\n. Thanks to @ePirat efforts you know have a wiki documenting Wekan installation. I plan to improve the state of documentation (probably using a read the docs instance at docs.wekan.io) at a later release. You can also discuss these issues in the forum.\n. Thank you for opening this discussion, the project sees (unexpected early) momentum and I believe this is an issue a lot of people will raise. As one of the project co-author, let me share what I think of it, and more generally what I think of this project.\nSince I haven't express my views anywhere already it's probably valuable to share a timeline overview of the project (all of it being verifiable in the git history). @yasaricli started this project at the end of January 2014 as a simple fun project, building a clone of Trello using the meteor framework. At the time it was even-more a clone than today, and the project even included the Trello logo (!). He worked on it during about 10 days until \u201cabandoning\u201d it for the following 10 months. He resumed the work on December of last year, few days later I heard of it, was excited by the potential of an open-source kanban board, and I decided to port the project to the Sandstorm platform (which is a tool that let you install web applications on your own server easily). I didn't received much feedback about this port, probably because sandstorm is still a niche ecosystem, but because I believed in the project I continued to play with it, implementing a big list of new features (cf. v0.7 and v0.8 of our roadmap) basically working full time on it for the last three weeks. And since yesterday, the project is getting popular on github.\nSo, copyright infringement. To be honest I think we are on the red line; but I believe we haven't crossed it. It's important to note that we write all our code, and this code is completely different from the closed source Trello code that we never have access to. Nevertheless I agree with you, I want us to have our own identity, and that's why I've been arguing in favor of a project rename (the project was called Metrello), I asked the community for new UI ideas, and I'll continue to work on that direction, for instance by replacing Trellicons by a free alternative as soon as possible (BTW the issue @MichaelBanks raised is already fixed).\nBut actually your critic was not only legal, but also moral. You stated that you \u201clove Trello\u201d, and that we \u201ccan't just steal their work\u201d because we need \u201cto honor Trello's hard work\u201d, and @miguelcobain added \u201cIs it ethical?\u201d. The problem with moral and ethics is that they are context-based evaluation functions \u2014 and certainly not universal. Radical Islamist morale is maybe not the same as mine, and what a hacker think is ethical may be different of what his government thinks of it. I stand in the hackers camp. I'm the kind of person concerned by privacy violations, I never used facebook (and probably lost some friends because of that) and every time people keep asking why, I tell them how bad it is to give all you personal data to a unique private company, I also try to escape google services, and I have a PGP key. You see the kind of profile, privacy aware we could say. Or at least I thought I was.\nWith the recent interest for LibreBoard, people started registering and using the online instance we deployed on libreboard.com (both Ya\u015far and I have access to it). With that access and a single line of bash I can connect a slightly modified version of LibreBoard (just add the autopublish package of meteor) to the production database; and boom, I can see what everyone is doing on any board in real time. This is just terrifying, and even if I was perfectly aware of this privacy issue, I didn't fully digest it until I experienced what it means concretely. Most people are just testing the software, but some of you seems to actually put private data in it. Ya\u015far even received a mail from a company asking him if they can trust him with their data (!). It's even more terrifying when you realize Trello has 5 millions clients and a lot of them are putting private stuff in it (including me). Please, don't trust us with your private data, you don't need to, and it would be bad for both you and us. Feel free to use as much public boards as you want, but if you want to use a private board, keep it private (we'll help you doing that).\nWe are in this moment of the human history where every photo we take with our iPhone is sent to Apple, operating systems send our GPS position to Google, TVs (telescreen?) have webcam always connected to the internet, and I could continue this list as much as I want putting all the \u201ccloud\u201d stuff that we use a little more every days. We developers, designers, software makers, need to fight against power centralization; otherwise we'll end up in the Orwell's world \u2014 only a few decades after the roman prediction. There is a lot of work to decentralize photos, videos, messages, etc. With LibreBoard we are only doing that work for \u201ckanban data\u201d like projects management or personal list of people to call. A tiny piece in the grand scheme of things, but still something valuable in my opinion.\nData privacy is not the only reason I decided to spend some time and efforts on an open-source kanban board, I also believe software developed in the open ends up being better that their closed alternatives. We plan to implement features Trello doesn't have, and in fact already have sandstrom support (as I explained above), and localization (which is very valuable for the +90% of users that are more fluent in their native language than in English). We are going to implement more of it, and I expect the open-source community to work on plugins such as github issues synchronization (it should be easy), or LDAP integration (it should be even easier since there is already a LDAP package for the meteor user account system), or \u201csend bitcoin to vote on a card\u201d, and many more crazy plugin ideas I can't even think of.\nSo given that (1) we give you your data back, and (2) we can do better than spying alternatives, I have zero ethical problems working on this project. As we work on it, the UI similarities with Trello will decrease over time (that have begun), and this won't be an issue anymore in a month or two.\n. As of a0e1faab6802478af9f0e221fbb01234962417d3 we don't use Trellicons anymore.\n. We received a DMCA takedown notice from github; it should appear here in the coming hours.\n. I did not create this application, @yasaricli did. I've been working on removing Trello assets (logo, Trellicons...) from the repository because I believe this application has a lot of potential on its own. The next release will include a new UI (if you would like to help, please join #94), and in the meantime this github repository is emptied to complain with the DMCA (which basically solves this issue).\n. @danielytics, @wpietri, and @syrnick, I understand your point. You are asking the authors to apologize for having stolen Trello assets. And by \u201cthe authors\u201d you mean Yasar and me.\nI just want to emphasize that I haven't done what you are accusing me; namely ripping of Trello. The Metrello project was published by Yasar in January 2014 and included some Trello copyrighted assets (logo, trellicons, and CSS). Yasar already explained why he did that (to play with Meteor) and that he had no bad intentions.\nI discovered the project 11 months later; I liked the idea of an open-source kanban board made with Meteor (I have some expertise in the framework) and I started improving it. Yasar gave me write access to his repository and put my name on the home page but I asked neither of that.\nI implemented some features Trello have (label management, board stars) and some Trello doesn't have (sandstorm, internationalization). I've also been removing Trello assets from the repository (not from the git history tough) and I'm currently working on a new UI. A lot of people are suggesting that we should just change a bit the visual aspect and return to github (which was my original plan before the DMCA). I'm now getting more serious about it by working on some significant UI/UX modifications from scratch (BTW not only CSS, but also the templates). I sincerely hope all this work will be appreciated.\n. @ocdtrekkie Absolutly\n. @ojosdegris This bug was fixed in 0.8; thanks (next time, please open a separate github issue, it makes things easier to manage)\n@Bersam I reproduced this bug and will work on a fix along with the new UI for the next release\n. Fixed on the new-ui branch\n. Inviting @stugreenham in the conversation;\n. We released v0.8 yesterday (with a lot of new great features in it!), and it's now the time to fully focus on our new UI. Due to the DCMA notice, we won't push any code on github, but we'll keep working in the open on a self-hosted gitlab instance. I've also set a separate instance of the online application on http://newui.librebroad.com so we can share our experiments and break things.\nI'm not certain @yasaricli agree with me on that (please share what you think!), but for my part I don't want this re-design to be \u201cjust change the CSS so we can get back on github\u201d. I'm willing to work on much more deeper modifications to the way the application work (how we assign members and label to a card in the board view, how the multi-selection feature will work, how we select a board, how we integrate pomodoro timers, etc.). So if you're thinking about how we can improve things, don't feel limited by the amount of code re-write you're idea will require.\nThere is also the mobile. We're not going to develop native LibreBoard applications on Android and iOS, instead we will wrap the web client in Cordova (which is easy to do with meteor by the way). I don't want to abuse marketing words, but \u201cmobile first\u201d could be a good approach for our new user interface.\n@ocdtrekkie Multi-design would be a very cool feature indeed. Unfortunately, due to the way meteor works (take all the CSS files it can find and merge them in one big file) this is not something we can implement easily. So let's keep this idea for a later release.\n@ryngonzalez I would love to tell you that we have a vision about the way we want to spatially organize information. But as far as I know our only fundamental difference is to be a free and open-source software; I'm not sure we can emphasize data privacy in the UI (I don't think so), but maybe one point to consider here would be plugin extensibility.\nAlso, if someone has some ideas to improve the kanban paradigm, feel free to share them (@JamborJan proposed #98). Maybe the multi-selection idea could have some ramifications? For instance we could make the labels click-able to open a menu like \u201cRemove this label\u201d + \u201cFilter cards on this label\u201d, and have a similar menu on the member icon.\nIt seems that there is a consensus to use the mockup of @stugreenham as a basis, and iterate on that (side note commenters, keep in mind Stu didn't originally made this mockup for our use case). Stu, could you authorize others to iterate on your design? For me, this mockup raises a number of issues we need to figure out:\n- Do we need a sidebar (similar to the Trello sidebar)?. I tend to think it would be possible to move all board actions to the top board bar. Maybe this top board content could also change depending on the context, for instance become a \u201cdrop here to archive\u201d when we are dragging a card (like on the android version of Trello), or became a filter selection if we are in the filtered view. Non-frequent actions could be moved to a menu accessible by cliquing on the gears icon on the right. However we definitely need a sidebar on the mobile UI.\n- How do we keep a level of board user customization? Should the user be able to select a header color? Do we want to support background images for the header (a bit like chrome themes) while we keep the content on a white background?\n- How do we select a board? It seems that the top left hamburger icon could open a left pane with a board list?\n- How about white cards on a grey background, like Google Now?\nThere are also potential discussions about square vs round avatars, or about the way we display labels on the board view (anyone like the way Fabrice Liut [1] solves this?), but I don't have a strong opinion on these.\nAnd we also need a new logo #64.\n. Also in most mockups the logo is tacking a significant area. I don't think we care enough about our brand to take all that place, and I believe we don't even need to put the logo in the board interface (just keep the application name in the window title).\n. @andreioprisan if you want to help you can send a merge request on http://git.libreboard.com/libreboard/libreboard\n. I started working on a new design today. What I have below is an actual implementation (not an image). A lot of features are bugged due to some code reorganization, so I'll try to fix that before I release the code.\n\nOne of the idea here, is to have quick access to starred boards on the small top bar, this is a feature inspired by the sub-reddits bar. I also removed the sidebar and put all the board information in the top bar. This top bar will change depending on the context, for instance if I'm on a filtered view the bar will display the filters, if I'm dragging a card the bar will display a \u201cdrop here to archive\u201d button, and on the home page, the bar will just display a LibreBoard logo.\nAlso I moved the menu that was on the sidebar into a popup that is accessible by clicking on the board title. For instance to change the board color:\n\nAs I said, this is a very early prototype (not even 24 hours!), so I haven't worked on typography, space rhythm, clean animations, color adjustment, etc. I just wanted to share what I have done today :-)\n. So my current ideas around activities:\n- On the home page have a feed of activities for all starred board, and all followed members (like github)\n- On the board page click on the board menu then \u201cActivities\u201d and that will open an overlay window containing all the activities for this board.\n- We also need to redesign activities UI, personally I love how github/githab draw their feed with a vertical time line with messages and events. Since the gitlab design is released under the MIT license I might just use that for our activities feeds\n. @Coppolaemilio Cool! What kind of things would you like to do? Implement new features? Help with the design?\n. Hey @stugreenham, happy to read you here again. Did you see my last two comments in the flow? https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/94#issuecomment-71327633 and https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/94#issuecomment-71393038 (\u2190I started an actual implementation cc  @denisinla).\n. Give me a few days to implement a design proposition and release the code; then we will be able to collectively iterate on that.\n. For the curious, here is where I am currently (again it's an implementation not a mockup):\n\nThere is even more bugged features than last time because I've been touching code everywhere. But nothing to worry here, I just need some time.\n. Thank you very much @bmathews, this is a great feedback; I've updated the stylesheet to follow your recommendations. You had to be motivated to create a complete jsfiddle!\nThis is going to be great\n. I'm still not sure about the \u201cshould we have a sidebar\u201d question. My initial idea was to differentiate from trello and simplify the layout by merging the sidebar into the header bar. If you take a look at alternative kanban boards on my first post you'll see than none of them have a sidebar. \nOn the other hand a retractable sidebar like the one @Squ34k3rZ did seems useful, and difficult to improve. It gives informations (board members, labels, and activities) that other kanban software doesn't provide as easily.\nAny thought on this topic?\n. Thank you @fnky, your mockups are inspiring. I decided to give a try to the no \u201cboard sidebar\u201d approach. That does not mean we won't have a sidebar at all, quite the contrary. We could use a sidebar on large screen to display card detailed view (you can discuss this idea in #127) and for the board activity feed \u2014 but not for labels and members that will be in the header.\nAlso we don't need a filter selector like the one you drawn, we will be able to filter cards by clicking on a member avatar and selecting \u201cFilter cards with this member\u201d. The top bar will then change to display a big \"X Filter view\" title and displaying all the active filters. Clicking on \"X\" will reset the filter. I will implement this in the coming days so you can share what you think of it.\nHere is the current state of my implementation:\n\nI imagine a lot of graphical details could be discussed from it. Round avatars? Border-less covers? Improving \"Add a card/list\" buttons? Card labels? Also I don't really like the Starred/Labels/Search top toolbar; I will probably try with some bigger icons and no text, a bit like in @fnky's mockup.\nI moved the publicity setting (public vs private board) into the board menu since this is probably not something you'll change often. I think we still want to display an icon (a globe for public, a lock for private) in the header.\nAny feedback?\n. Also since there is already more than 100 messages here, I propose to split the new design discussion in multiple thematics threads:\nRe-design discussions:\n- #126 For the home page and the activity feed\n- [current] For the board general view\n- #127 For the card detailed view\nThe landing page will also be redesigned, but later.\n. @catmanjan More than a week, less than a month \u2014 which is a more elegant way to answer 2 weeks\u2122.\n@Squ34k3rZ LibreBoard will be used by both individuals users, and teams (since it synchronize the view in real time) \u2014 like Trello. And LibreBoard is not only available in English but also in French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish, and Portuguese (more are coming).\n. Invite by email was implemented in #422 and will be released in the upcoming v0.10.\n. Done.\n. Let's move this conversation into #94.\n. Hello, have you already tried the filtered view? \n. Oh yes, this was implemented recently (last week) and I haven't already published a new release. You can test this feature on http://libreboard.com or wait until early next week for the sandstorm release :-)\n. Yes, the attachment feature will land in v0.8 early next week.\n. Thank you very much for reporting this security issue. I don't know how fluent you all are in English, but it will be really better if we can all speak a common language in our github bug tracker.\nAbout the security issue itself, @yasaricli who did implement this feature is not currently available to work on a fix, so I'll take it. If I understand the issue correctly html files (and maybe js also) are interpreted in the application instead of being downloaded leading to XSS injections. Would changing the MIME header to application/octet-stream to force the browser to download the file be sufficient in this case?\n. Please review the security fix I released and deployed to http://libreboard.com.\nPreviously uploaded attachments have been migrated \u2014 please refresh your browser cache to test the migration.\n. The close [X] icon is fixed.\n. Fixed in the master branch. The fix will be in the next release (v0.9).\n. See also #58.\n. Are you talking about server-side logs? Normally meteor handle timestamping for us, so we can just use JavaScript default console.log, console.warn, etc. Currently we don't have such call (apart for the migrations), so we need to figure out the kind of events we want to log (DDP connections, database operations, other indicators?).\n. What do you mean by \u201cgitlab integration\u201d?\n. So issues synchronization with gitlab similar to https://huboard.com or https://waffle.io, correct? I don't think this will be a core feature \u201cin the near future\u201d, but that would be a great plugin!\n. (I'm using firefox as my main browser and on android) I cannot reproduce your issue.\n. If you use the instance we provide at http://libreboard.com, you are not only leaking the metadata, but also the data themselves (to me, Yasar, meteor, and amazon... at least). So don't put private stuff in it.\n. The instance deployed on https://wekan.io/sign-in is now self-hosted and isn\u2019t calling the meteor.com servers anymore, which basically solve this issue.\n. Implemented in master, and testable in http://newui.libreboard.com.\n. Hi @xavierpriour, this is the right place to discuss the feature UI/UX and implementation. As far as a know (I being the lead dev) no one has started working on it. I would be happy to help you to get this merged in core if you decide to work on it :-)\n. Here are some quick answers to some of the points you raised:\n- I think it\u2019s best to map board members using their email address. If the email is unknown, we need to call something like inviteUserByEmail('aa@bb.cc'). This function isn\u2019t currently implemented but we need it anyway and could probably re-use some of the code written for another Meteor application (I think Rocket.chat has this feature);\n- :+1: for the UI to import a card\n- For the UI to import a board I would add a link below the \u201cCreate\u201d button of the \u201cCreate a board\u201d popup, something like (\u201cor import a board from Trello\u201d)\n- I think the JSON text copy/pasting will more used than downloading a file from Trello and upgrade it to a Wekan instance, so I think the UI should put the textarea field first.\n. - I for one don\u2019t think uploading a JSON file is required, I believe copy pasting the JSON code should be enough. If someone has a strong need for it we could implement it later on.\n- We manage attachments using meteor/collectionFS which is pretty complete and has a great documentation. I haven\u2019t verified but I think the wiki page insert one file from a remote URL is what we want here.\n- Are you saying that you would like to have an actual \u201cuser mapping\u201d screen? What I had in mind was automatic mapping based on the user email address. If we are concerned about sending Wekan invites unexpectedly we could have a second screen saying\n\nUsers A, B, and C were not found in this server database. Do you want to invite them?\n\nAnd I guess have a checkbox next to each user name and a Submit and Dismiss buttons. (BTW I don\u2019t consider this as a requirement to merge #362.)\nI edited the roadmap, thanks for the reminder. Do you have an account on http://try.wekan.io so I could add you on the appropriate card?\n. I\u2019m not aware of any but I\u2019ll search for a solution. By \u201cupload manager\u201d do you mean a way to schedule jobs, restart them if they fail, report progress and errors? Should it have any other specific feature?\n. Oh yes I remember that I already played with https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-power-queue \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t seem maintained anymore unfortunately.\n. Let's open another thread for CSV import and keep this one about Trello JSON (which is now implemented thanks to Xavier) \n. I\u2019m considering a slight change of the import from Trello UI. Basically clicking \u201cImport from Trello\u201d would open a full page importer instead of staying in the constrained space inside the popup. The motivations are:\n- Being able to provide more instructions/help since we would have more space\n- Being able to show some more options (for instance format data {JSON from Trello, Json from Wekan, CSV, Other}) and some more visual element (for instance an import progress bar with step 1 - step 2 - step 3)\n- Avoid closing the Popup unexpectedly and losing the state of the import in process (eg, during the member mapping)\n- Sandstorm. The \u201cimport from Trello\u201d feature isn\u2019t currently available on the Sandstorm and I would like to implement it. Since a Sandstorm grain contains only one board, we don\u2019t have the \u201cplus\u201d sign to create a new board and thus we can\u2019t really display the \u201cimport\u201d popup in it. After discussion with @kentonv I figured out that a reasonable implementation would be to create a second action (ie, a second way to instantiate a grain from the Sandstorm shell) that would start with the import wizard in full screen mode, instead of creating a blank board.\nWe don\u2019t really have a lot of full pages yet (the only one would be https://wekan.io/shortcuts which is not the most polished) so we probably need a little bit of generic layout styling as well. @xavierpriour what do you think of this idea? Would you change some things (add some infos...) if you had a full page screen instead of just a 300px popup? BTW Xavier, I\u2019m just asking for feedback but I\u2019m not asking you to work on this, I\u2019ll probably do it myself if you agree with the above points :-)\n. Cool, thank you for the input! For reference, I started working on it in #430. \n. I guess the \u201cimport card from Trello\u201d feature would stay in a popup tough.\n. Well if there isn\u2019t, it\u2019s probably better to remove the feature from the UI. And if someone really need it and can\u2019t wait for the plugin system, one way to emulate it would be to import the Trello board containing the desired card and then move the card from the imported board to the desired board \u2014 which doesn\u2019t sound super complex (assuming #388 is implemented at some point).\n. Ok perfect, I will do it in #430. That will actually simplify the implementation because I won\u2019t have to manage two different UI targets (full page and popup) for the same components.\n. This page has been removed in the master branch.\n. It seems to be a bug with the easy-search feature (https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-easy-search/issues/126), I have disabled this functionality while this get resolved. Thank you for the bug report.\nhttp://git.libreboard.com/libreboard/libreboard/commit/6ccf5d730ad060cad8a41619ef3e0ec7b92be34a\ncc @yasaricli who implemented this feature.\n. I fixed the bug and re-enabled the search feature in http://git.libreboard.com/libreboard/libreboard/commit/b7daaafec6a81b7e512991e757b6438b32ed6187\nThank you very much for this security hole report.\n. Since the release of Wekan v0.9, I try to keep the GitHub issues tracker exclusively for bug reports and specified feature requests \u2014 the goal for me being to close the issue as soon as possible. For more general discussions about Wekan (that will stay open) I encourage you to post on our new forum.\n. Unfortunately I can't reproduce this bug. Could you give more details? \n. Like how to reproduce this bug.\n. Is this just an idea, or a feature you plan to use when it gets ready?\n. Fixed in f4c80d1315c181300bd37ef5de98c365325bc130\n. Hi Florent, \nThe idea was more to wrap the application in Cordova. Could you share the name of some applications you created?\n. We already have a de facto public API. Meteor enforce you to separate the source code of your application (written in javascript and served over HTTP) and the data (using the DDP protocol). The DDP protocol has a publish/subscribe feature and a RPC model that are better than a REST API to develop a mobile application. So the easier way for a native mobile application to communicate to a LibreBoard server would be to use a DDP client.\nOf course, this API is not stabilized and not document at all. In fact I even have some significant change ideas in mind. But when it gets more mature no doubt that this will used as a public API.\n. Yes that's the plan \u2014 DDP for mobile apps, REST for third party integration.\n. Translations happen in Transifex. We already have a chinese team that have translated the application. I just pulled their work on deployed it on libreboard.com\nFeel free to join them if you would like https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/libreboard/ :-)\n. This is because descriptions and comments are handled by a markdown viewer; and in the markdown \"spec\" you have to insert two new lines to start a new paragraph, inserting only one new line just add a space (like in HTML).\nI guess we'll want to use something like github flavored markdown that handled this in a more natural way for most users.\n. The lastest work on the master solves a lot of performance issues. They will be released in v0.9.\n. @pwmvx1289 If you have some specific ideas about UI, feel free to share any mockup of it.\n. So first of all, Wekan doesn\u2019t implement any specific logic to serve the application to a given URL, this is all handled by the Meteor framework and the routing package (flow-router). As you noticed @StreakyCobra the ROOT_URL_PATH_PREFIX environment variable doesn\u2019t have any effect (not sure where it came from) but the path is supposed to be deduced from the ROOT_URL variable (see https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/2067)\nI think this is a problem with Flow-router, will investigate.\n. Hopefully, https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/pull/329 should fix the issue.\n. Here it is! I don\u2019t plan to release a new version in the following days so if you need this feature sooner @StreakyCobra I encourage you to create the container directly from the source. It should be as simple as:\nbash\n$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wekan/wekan.git\n$ cd wekan\n$ docker build -t StreakyCobra/wekan .\n. Let me take a look\n. You\u2019re welcome :)\n. This feature is planned :-)\n. @ocdtrekkie is right, I just pushed the current state of things (http://git.libreboard.com/libreboard/libreboard/commit/7ab66641210831a7c8da28d1d24c993653ff6df0).\n. This is done on the newui branch that you can see on http://git.libreboard.com/libreboard/libreboard\n. I can\u2019t reproduce this, could you confirm that this is fixed on master (or http://newui.libreboard.com)?\n. I'm pretty sure the long uploading time is due to the fact that newui.libreboard.com uses the meteor free hosting solution. I'll investigate if meteor commercial hosting (Galaxy) is worth it for this project.. But motivation for working on this project is still that people will be able to host it on their own machine.\n. Closing in favour of #95 .\n. I didn't write a lot of lines of code the last few weeks \u2014 or at least, not as much as I wanted. But I have been thinking about this project a lot. I'm considering building a company to develop the project full time, inspired by gitlab for instance. I've been thinking about a strategy, talking with a few platforms that could integrate LibreBoard in their ecosystem, and a lot of various things.\nThe short-term goal is still to finish the new ui, and get back to business on github.\n. The code is back on GitHub. I have done some significant re-write of the internals, fixing quite a few bugs and performances issues. The UI is not \u201cfinished\u201d, there are a lot of glitches and some missing features (eg, card attachments), but I'll continue to develop it here on GitHub.\n. Some performances issues have been fixed in the newui branch.\n. Let's keep this issue open until we have a proper fix (infinite scrolling/subscription paging).\n. I separated the activities subscription from the main board subscription, and implemented an infinite scrolling system to download the activities page per page (20 activities per page). The commit is visible here and will be in the next release.\n. This is fixed in the Renaissance era :-)\n. Hello Jeremy,\nI'm sorry you are in a messy state, the bug you are referring to should be fixed with the following change:\n``` diff\n@@ client/views/main/routers.js  @@\n        Router.configure({\n             redirectLoggedInUsers = options['redirectLoggedInUsers'];\n     // redirect logged in users to Boards view when they try to open Login or Signup views\n\n\nif (Meteor.user() && redirectLoggedInUsers) {\n\nif (Meteor.userId() && redirectLoggedInUsers) {\n            // redirect\n            this.redirect('Boards');\n            return;\n         }\n // authenticated\n\n\nif (!Meteor.user() && authenticate) {\nif (!Meteor.userId() && authenticate) {// redirect\nthis.redirect(authenticate);\n\n// options authenticate not next().\nreturn;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nif (!Meteor.user()) this.layout('layout');\n\nif (!Meteor.userId()) this.layout('layout');     // user found then AuthLayout render\n     else this.layout('AuthLayout');\n\n```\n\n\nI hope you'll be able to switch back to mainstream release when we'll release v0.9 (including official docker image). Feel free to email me if you need some help for that. Out of curiosity, what modifications did you made to adapt LibreBoard to your company needs?\n. I can't reproduce this bug with the current master version (or on http://newui.libreboard.com).\n. Closing because this was fixed a while back, thanks for the report!\n. I can't reproduce this bug with the latest master (deployed on http://newui.libreboard.com).\n. I just realized that I forgot to say thank you for the bug report @nata-goddanti :)\n. The above commit fixes the issue but v0.9 still needs some work before I can release a updated spk :)\n. I can\u2019t reproduce this bug, docker build is working for me.\nIt seems the error is causing by the fact you don\u2019t have git in your PATH. I\u2019m not sure how we should handle this case.\n. The last released version is v0.8. The next version is a work in progress and developed in the open on the master branch. Since it\u2019s a major rewrite some features are missing from v0.8, and I need to re-implement them before the release.\nCurrently there are no forums, but I plan to set a discourse instance after the v0.9 release.\n. In Wekan 0.9 it\u2019s now possible to archive and restore a card or a board. And by the way the forum was deployed at http://dicuss.wekan.io, would be happy to see you there :-)\n. > Is there a partially complete rewrite in progress that does things better but has yet to reinstate all functionality?\nYes. The next release (v0.9) is a ~70% re-write. It\u2019s probably better to wait a bit for things to stabilize before diving into LibreBoard.\n. So it\u2019s seems that you know JavaScript programming. One thing you could work on (because it is mostly not affected by the current UI changes) is the REST API. There is an important community demand for this API (#128).\nIf that something you are also interested in you can clone the project and create a  restApi.js file on the server directory, then take a look at the collections schemas and interface them with a REST API (it\u2019s probably good to follow https://trello.com/docs/api/ so that so people could inter-operate plugins written for the two applications). You may want to use a meteor package to help writing this interface such as restivus.\nIf you don\u2019t like this idea, what else would you like to do?\n. No you don\u2019t really need to start with authorization. We currently don\u2019t have a oAuth infrastructure and as you have seen I don\u2019t know any package to provide a simple solution for this. So we\u2019ll probably need to design mosts part of the oAuth system ourselves including the UI to generate and revoke access keys.\nI believe mapping a REST API with collections methods is a much simpler task. Even without the authorization system it will be useful for public boards and in environments that handle access control themselves (such as sandstorm). Once this API work, we will be able to add the authorization extra step.\n. Sounds good! Don\u2019t forget to share your work in progress for the restivus server so that others in the community could follow the development.\nAlso I should mention that I didn\u2019t take a close look at restivus yet, so if you encounter any limitation with its API it may be worth to take a look at the alternatives.\n. Also,\n\nHowever, clearly, not all Libreboard projects will run on Sandstorm\n\nYes, absolutely. We support multiple targets (sandstorm, docker) and I plan to add more in the future (AMI, deb, etc.). I was just evoking sandstorm because it\u2019s a case where we don\u2019t need to manage authorizations even for \u201cprivate\u201d boards. \n. @martinhbramwell I apologize for not having reviewed you work, it's definitely not a \u201cdeliberate insult\u201d. I've been working pretty much alone on this project, which mean that when I don't work, nothing gets done (at least on the code base, it's not true for the documentation and translations). Some people have been asking me (by e-mail) about a REST API, and I've always redirected them to your work, if you needed a proof that it was not my intention to ignore you.\nLately I've also been thinking a lot about the subscription and mutation model, I was very inspired by the Facebook and Netflix talks about Relay and Falcor and I think this is the kind of API we will want going forward. At the same time we currently have a DDP API (and there is no clear consensus in the meteor community about how we should mutate collections, whether directly with minimongo on the client, or systematically using DDP methods), and thirdly some people ask for a REST API as discussed in this issue. Handling this set of three significantly different APIs will be something non-trivial, and I've been maintaining the status quo (ie, DDP only) waiting for the ecosystem to mature.\nI did also hope that other people interested in a REST API could help you, but since it seems to not be the case, I'll review your work and help when I finish fixing the little bugs blocking the 0.9 release.\n. Wekan v0.9 is released so I started working on the REST API. I really don't have a lot of experience building these kind APIs. I looked at your Swagger specification (didn't know Swagger) and it looks great! I guess that will be useful to test the API and to generate client-side library if needed.\nOn the server part, I started to centralize all mutations at the model level (in 45b662a1ddb46a0f17fab7b2383c82aa1e1620ef) to avoid logic duplication between the DDP and the REST API. I then tried to implement a few REST methods but it turns out the Trello API (that I never used by the way) is more complex than I expected, and I need to understand it better (how does actions work for instance)\nAbout Relay and Falcor, I looked at a lot of material about it, I started with https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1439&v=9sc8Pyc51uU and it was a great introduction.\nTo me, the goal of the REST API isn't to be the primary interface to interact with a Wekan server, but mostly to be compatible with Trello ecosystem, to facilitate the switch. The primary interface will stay DDP for now (that means that the web client will continue to use that, and not the REST API), and will probably evolve to Relay once they figure out a few missing required pieces (eg, how to handle real time values).\n. As sharing was actually implemented in Wekan v0.9, this issue is now fixed.\n. Yes the original author did include some Trello copyrighted files since the very beginning. So I had to restart the repository from scratch to remove them from the git history.\nThe active repository is here, on GitHub. The self-hosted gitlab instance was a temporary solution to keep the development in the open while I was removing the latest Trello files. The Gitlab instance will be disabled by the end of June.\n. Thanks @ePirat :)\n. You can know contribute by discussing on the forum or sending a Pull Request here on GitHub :)\n. v0.9 is a work in progress. The version requires major re-factoring of the internals (about 70% of the code is re-written). You can follow the developement here on GitHub, see the open issues with the milestone filter, or test it live on http://newui.libreboard.com.\nI'm working on it every day, and making significant progress. There will be at least two or three release candidates before the final v0.9. \n. This seems to be a problem with https://github.com/mquandalle/meteor-bower, but I'm not sure what is causing it. Maybe you have any additional indication to help me reproduce it?\n. BTW, I guess there isn't anything specific to LibreBoard with this bug, but it is instead a problem with https://github.com/mquandalle/meteor-bower (and maybe some inherent limitations with the meteor build-system).\n. So we are talking about meteor build here, right?\n. I'm sorry you had an hard time installing Libreboard. Note that you are dealing with in flux software, once v0.9 is released, docker images will be a reasonably easy way to install Libreboard on your own server.\n. Private boards are already implemented, they will only be accessible to boards members. Organizations doesn't exists yet, so that's the first thing to create to have \u201corganizations visible boards\u201d.\n. LibreBoard puts its whole state and users data in the linked MongoDB (doesn't write the file system, or do anything else). So to backup your entire state you have to mongodump this database.\nTo upgrade to a new version, you'll have to stop the old version and start the new one. The new version will detect that some data have an old format and will automatically migrate them on start.\n. Here is the current state of these things:\n| Action | in v0.8 | in master | in v0.9 (prevision) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Archive a card | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Restore a card |  | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Delete a card | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Archive a list | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Restore a list |  |  | \u2714 |\n| Delete a list |  |  | \u2714 |\n| Archive a board | \u2714 |  | \u2714 |\n| Restore a board |  |  | \u2714 |\n| Delete a board |  |  | \u2714 |\n. Here is the current state of these things:\n| Action | in v0.8 | in master | in v0.9 (prevision) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Archive a card | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Restore a card |  | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Delete a card | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Archive a list | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Restore a list |  |  | \u2714 |\n| Delete a list |  |  | \u2714 |\n| Archive a board | \u2714 |  | \u2714 |\n| Restore a board |  |  | \u2714 |\n| Delete a board |  |  | \u2714 |\n. Here is an update on the current state of things. In the interest of ever releasing v0.9 I will probably postpone the remaining delete operations to a later release (BTW Trello doesn't have them as well).\n| Action | in v0.8 | in master |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Archive a card | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Restore a card |  | \u2714 |\n| Delete a card | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Archive a list | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Restore a list |  | \u2714 |\n| Delete a list |  |  |\n| Archive a board | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Restore a board |  | \u2714 |\n| Delete a board |  |  |\n. Closing as the possibility to archive solve the problem for most users, feel free to re-open a specific issue if you would like to have any specific non-implemented feature (like \u201cdelete a list\u201d).\n. I tried on Safari v8.0.8 and wasn\u2019t able to reproduce this bug. But since the line you pointed contained a mistake (document instead of document.body) I corrected it in the above commit. Does that solve this issue?\n. Cool! Thank you for the precise report!\n. Does commit bc9fcc7 fix the problem?\n. Closing because this was fixed a while back, thanks for the report :)\n. The GitHub repository is the one that is currently active.\n. I\u2019m not familiar with OpenShift. Now that v0.9 is released with official Heroku deploy, could you send a Pull Request implementing one-click deploy for Openshift?\n. Actually you don't need to meteor on your server production. Once v0.9 is released we will provide a npm install npm start source, along with the docker and sandstorm packages.\n. I'm closing this issue because the OP question has been answered. If you want to continue the discussion on raw hosting, please use #90.\n. This was implemented, thanks for the inspiration!\n. I understand the error, will fix it.\n. That's because there is a (somehow arbitrary) 32Kio limit on avatar size (see https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/blob/80a4bdd417f6d11b828ca9a2f09c0d87ae7efe48/collections/avatars.js#L6).\nThis limitation is here because we don't have any server-side image compression infrastructure for now (and it is not easy to set up, as we need to handle every supported platforms), so avatars are sent in there full size to the clients. Should I set a higher limit?\nAnd yes we need better error reporting, but that whole avatar thing is pretty boring to implement. I hope will be able to extract this feature in a community maintained package reasonably soon.\n.

I hope will be able to extract this feature in a community maintained package reasonably soon.\n. Yes this would be reasonable, but the problem is that I want LibreBoard to be easily self-hostable, which mean that I have to make sure the imagemagick binary is installed in every supported targets (ie, docker images, sandstorm package, heroku image, and manual installation). This is too much work for me to be implemented for the next release.\n. Yes the first step is to implement card ids understandable by humans (ie, incremental ids) as Trello of GitHub issue numbers do. Then we can implement a user interface in the markdown editor to support card reference.\n. Ok, I'll merge this. But anyway the whole set of translation string will be re-organized before v0.9 because of the UI changes \u2014 and also we should take advantage of advanced i18n features such as plural strings.\n. Merged in 95dcd8a146d5fa8ef0957019faf59fbfdcf98788, thanks :)\nIt's really easier for me to manage these things on Transifex. Currently the project is a bit frozen until I update the new keys, but may I add you to the German team?\nAs for Travis CI failure, I think it's just that the test has been executed when you submitted the PR, and it was not updated again when a changed Travis CI configuration (ie, when I disabled it)\n. The current DockerFile works for me, I'm not sure how the change you propose improve things?\n. I'm rejecting this PR because I believe the meteord base image is perfectly adapted to this application. If you want to see how the image was built you can read the corresponding dockerfiles. This image also gets update with the correct versions of some of our dependencies (eg, in Wekan v0.9 we need nodejs v0.10.40, and meteord provide this exact version).\nAlso about your particular Dockerfile, we probably don't want to chip the meteor utility in production images (this is only the build tool), and we don't want to run the server with meteor because it is intended for development, not production (for instance the files doesn't get gzipped, no forever or equivalent to restart the process in case it dies).\n. The whole routing scheme needs some work, giant random strings aren't easy to share (and aren't necessary). I guess Trello model is more reasonable.\n. This meteor package could help: https://atmospherejs.com/todda00/friendly-slugs\nBut you are right @ePirat, we need to implement (server-side) redirections (which the above package does not).\n. The minimum length is defined here. I don't have a strong opinion on whether or not it should be lowered.\n. It should be fixed in 8cf9ec266055f065c428216d53018c83b63675c6\n. This is a good idea!\nHowever since the release of Wekan v0.9, I try to keep the GitHub issues tracker exclusively for bug reports and specified feature requests \u2014 the goal for me being to close the issue as soon as possible. For more general discussions about Wekan (that will stay open), I recommend using our new forum. May I ask you @hsduk to copy/paste your post on the forum?\n. Closing in favour of #190.\n. I'm also unable to reproduce this,.\n. Is it related to #226?\n. Did you close this on purpose?\n. The installation wiki page now cover the points answered by @mko-x, so I\u2019m now closing this issue. Documentation still need some work though.\n. Closing in favour of #190.\n. This is probably a bug with tmeasday:presence the meteor package that we use to implement this feature. I'm not super happy with the way the package implement this feature (it sends a lot of avoidable DDP messages) and sometimes doesn't work that well. Without any reproduction or at least further details, it's difficult to see what is the problem in this particular case.\nI'm considering using another package for this feature \u2014 which means that I'll probably ends up writing my own.\n. Closing as a duplicate of #133.\n. Re-opening until this is fixed in master.\n. Thanks for the report! It's amazing that you\u2019ve come up with the solution in the above snippet, you should have to be very motivated! Hope this will be better now :)\nAnd don\u2019t hesitate to report any other IE problem, as a linux user I tend to forget this browser...\n. Does that solve the issue @schattennarr?\n. @ePirat in the manual install guide you said to install the latest version of node, does that work for you? Should we update the guide to recommend node v0.10 \u2014 which is the version meteor uses and is tested on?\n. From what I've seen in meteor-core development, meteor will probably stick with node v0.10 until the merge of iojs and node (node 5 or whatever it is called), so that's at least 6 months.\n. This is fixed in the upcoming v0.9 \u2014 closing so I can keep track of the remaining tasks.\n. Is that still the case (you can try on http://newui.libreboard.com)? If yes on which browser are you?\n. I'm closing this because it\u2019s probably not a bug with Wekan. Feel free to open a thread on the new forum if you encounter any issue during Wekan installation.\n. That seems weird to me, and I'm certainly unable to reproduce me. Labels change are implemented like any other change by using a mongo query that is persisted on the server. This is exactly the same macanism used to handle every other updates (the entire app mutable state lives in MongoDB).\nWhat may happen is that you make the modification in your browser and you see it reflected in the UI immediately, but if you have some connectivity issue between the client and the server, and you close your browser before the client is able to publish its changes to the server then you will encounter data loses.\nWe should have some warning indicator in the UI in case the browser is disconnected.\n. Closing in favour of #130.\n. Yep, I agree with the above message. Also to answer your first question we currently don't have any REST API. This is something other people are interested in as well, and there is an ongoing discussion about making one in #166.\n. You need to use node v0.10.40\n. Does that help?\n. These menu weren't implemented in the previous version, this is now fixed with v0.9.\n. If anyone is interested in implementing this feature I can provide some guidance. This should be fairly easy.\n. @synthesisGoogle come to chat on gitter if you have some questions, https://gitter.im/wekan/wekan\n. A first set of keyboard shortcuts will be added in release v0.9 (currently in master).\nDuplicate of #88.\n. This is implemented in the upcoming v0.9 :-)\n. This is implemented in the upcoming v0.9 :-)\n. Thanks for the report :) I'll fix this at the user interface level. The ability to edit other members messages (is that only for board admins?) is not implement.\nI will keep this issue for the UI bug, could you open another issue for the feature request (with description and motivation)?\n. This is fixed in the upcoming v0.10.\n. Got it.\n. I can't reproduce this:\n\nAny more infos? Which {Wekan,browser} version are you using? \n. I was able to see the bug in the deployed version. For some reason this version have a number a JS I have not seen at any stage of the development (things like Error: There are multiple templates named 'boardList'. Each template needs a unique name.). It seems that some files are included twice (but with different hashes). Is it possible that the app directorty contains additional files not present in the git history?\n. You\u2019re welcome :-)\n. I don't understand the issue, could you elaborate?\n. Fixed! @jadeqwang, I hope that didn't penalize you too much on Factorio :)\n. Thanks for the report!\n. Wekan dev here. As a non-native English speaker, I\u2019m curious of what people think of this.\n. Now that we have a forum, I believe this kind of discussion should happen there and not on the bug tracker (where I try to close issues as soon as possible). Sorry for the disagreement, but let's continue this discussion at http://discuss.wekan.io/t/how-to-pronunce-wekan/13 \n. The second release candidate is out and it fixes a fair amount of bugs that have been reported. A special thank you note to @nata-g who have been testing the application quite extensively :-)\nI plan to publish Wekan v0.9 final release on Thursday. We are still missing a lot of translations, please join us on Transifex if you would like to help.\n. Released!\n. I also have the following weird log\n``\ntoEnd: wrong arguments-i18n-compiler fr...  \\\nto: wrong arguments\n```\nsince I upgraded meteor to v1.2-rc.*. I imagine this is due to the changes in the meteor plugin API, but I didn't found the exact issue.\nAnyway, @michaelwemoto feel free to improve the install guide if some of things have confused you.\n. This was fixed in 91cfcf7b12b5e7c137c2e765b2c378dde6b82966.\n. I believe this was fixed in 9180a8d92a0dee969bba20239c253a6ecb186b2b. I've update newui.libreboard.com in case this is what you are using for testing. Could you confirm this bug is fixed?\n. This was fixed in 549f8fee3aee3675ae2c04fa14b88f4a783df2c6 but yet deployed for Sandstorm. I will publish a new spk with more bug fixes soon.\n. This is fixed in v0.9-rc2 and released on the Sandstorm market. \n. I think this one was also fixed. Could you check with the latest version on master?\n. I think they will have their place in the discourse forum I plan to open for the final v0.9 version (hopefully next week) and for easier questions in the new gitter chat https://gitter.im/wekan/wekan.\nThank for your documentation initiative by the way! I guess now that I have released a release candidate, the recommended raw install should download the built app from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases instead of downloading meteor and source code and building the app yourself. What do you think @ePirat?\n. Yep, I'm also an IRC user, but gitter is definitely more user friendly and with the IRC bridge, it provides the best of both worlds.\n. Distribution of server software is a hard problem with the current infrastructure, and adding the additional restriction of not relying on an internet connexion is making the problem even harder.\n@xiaohelong Do you have any technical solution to propose? Whatever method we use, we should not only support installation, but also easy upgrades.\n. This was fixed in 82b322777852b0f7b3f93295a0dbcc0c238bd20d.\n. Fixed in 82b322777852b0f7b3f93295a0dbcc0c238bd20d\n. I can\u2019t reproduce this one.\n. I'm not sure about this one. One of the idea of this panel is that you can still interact with the board mini-cards while viewing the opened cards. It works for things like drag and drop for instance, and in the future you may be able to have more interaction between the opened card and the rest of the board (eg, transform a subtask into a card by drag&drop, define some dependencies betweens cards, etc). Clicking on the board background is considered an explicit demand to close the current card.\nI may re-consider this as part of a much larger navigation re-factoring in a future release.\n. Hum I can't reproduce this bug. It seems to me that the board permissions are in a weird state (maybe due to some bugs in a previous version?).\nCould you try to open your browser JavaScript console and give me the output of the following command:\njs\nJSON.stringify(Boards.findOne(Session.get('currentBoard')).members)\n. Yes, the current behavior is expected in the current state of things. Allowing members to assign themselves and others to cards is also the default on Trello and something people will expect. This is one other feature request that will get solved by an admin board setting page (like #287).\n. Cf. #146.\n. Yes, I just need to put the appropriate CSS here.\ncf. #185\n. Allowing visitors to read archived cards and lists is is the expected behaviour. Trello also works this way, and I believe Wekan users expect the same feature. In the future we will probably have an administrator setting page where we could configure different kind of permission rules.\n. Cf. #146.\n. Closing, as a duplicate of #270.\n. I've re-enabled access to newui.libreboard.com. This instance was only deployed for testing purpose, not for production use. Since you have some data in it, I will keep it active until we have a way to export and re-import some board data (hopefully in v0.10). The data of libreboard.com was transferred to wekan.io. \n. Hum, are you using http://try.wekan.io? This bug was supposed to be fixed in e65c79edfadb67f3859e02ae55ad75369b7ebc17 but I forgot to publish this fix on this test instance, now it's done.\n. Yes, I plan to implement these for the next release (see also #129).\n. @nata-g Actually we don\u2019t use a lot of packages that are tightly coupled with Blaze, and for those who are (eg templates:tabs) there exists better alternatives in the React ecosystem.\n@AdamBrodzinski you seem to have a lot of experience with React integration in Meteor, I don\u2019t know if you are familiar with Wekan but I'm curious if you have some thoughts to share about migrating this kind of application to React (all the current blaze code is here, .jade and .js files weight about 4K LOC).\n. Yay! Facebook just launched React Native for Android. As a linux user I was frustrated because I couldn't play with React Native for iOS, now it become possible. Let\u2019s try to build a native Wekan app!\n. Hi @bastianwegge, sorry I missed your message. No there is no specific planning for the migration. I feel like Meteor integration with React isn\u2019t mature enough unless we also switch the build system (for instance with https://forums.meteor.com/t/webpack-compiler-inside-meteor-es6-modules-hot-reload-and-code-splitting/11264). I also don\u2019t like the Meteor mixin too much and would prefer to use React stateless functional components (new in React 0.14) and have some sort of wrapper (Higher-order component) that exposes the Meteor data similarly to what Relay does.\nUntil this eco-system matures a bit I don\u2019t feel super comfortable to engage this transition, but I'm confident the Meteor community will find great solutions in the following weeks. Bastian, do you have some experience with these topics?\n. @floatinghotpot Your level of enthusiasm is contagious! I would be delighted if you get to contribute to a native Wekan application. I played with React Native back when Facebook released the Android support, it was a bit difficult to set up on my Linux computer but after I got it up and running the developing experience was exceptional! I really think this is the best way for us to write a native application in 2016.\nTo keep things organized let\u2019s talk about React Native apps in #480 (which would probably start on a separate repository based on one of the react native starting kit), and keep this thread about the transition to React for the web client.\n. I also want to share that I\u2019m super excited about @arunoda\u2019s Mantra (early example here) and as we migrate to React I\u2019ll try to stick with as much Mantra principles as possible.\n. Just want to add yet another important argument in favor of the soon to come migration to React, and that is the possibility to compose UI components. That will be very valuable for our desired plugin system. I wrote about that on the forum.\n. One of the non-trivial part of the Blaze-to-React transition is the card drag and drop feature. From looking at their respective code and documentation, React Dnd has a better design and API than Jquery UI sortable. However I\u2019ve yet to see a Wekan-like kanban written with it and there always were some quirks in the demos I\u2019ve seen.\nDoes anyone know a good demo of card + column ordering using React Dnd?\n. @nata-g Yes, that's actually the idea. I plan to write on the stack I plan to use for the Wekan rewrite. \n. The underlined data model will be the one described in the above topic. However with the default set of modules installed the UX will be similar to what we currently have.\n. @nata-g This looks very cool, I will take a careful look as this application seems to implement a lot of the architecture principles I\u2019m planning for Wekan next. Thank you for the share!\n. And BTW, yes draft-js is also a very good library (though a bit young, not sure if we can use it for google-docs like realtime editing by multiple users with multiple cursors). But the underlined data model makes a lot of sense and is way better than the ad-hoc transformations that we currently do for users mentions and tag assignment. So yes, I want to use draft.js in Wekan next.\n. We should follow Rocket.chat implementation here.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\nFor the record, this bug was introduced in 45b662a.\n. Hi David,\nThe database is already configurable, at least with the raw-installation. It works by setting the MONGO_URL environment variable to a MongoDB URI. You can see one usage example of that in the wiki:\njs\nexport MONGO_URL='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wekan'\nIn this example the mongo server IP is 127.0.0.1 (ie localhost), the port is 27017 (default for MongoDB) and the database name is wekan.\nDoes that help?\n. It's all fine, I need to work on the documentation :)\n. As it is an important design change, I encourage you to open a thread on the forum to better define the need in an open discussion. Thank you.\n. I'm been thinking about this template feature. As a always try to keep things simple especially in the code base, I feel that being able to clone a board (as requested in #134) would basically solve this issue \u2014 calling a particular board a \u201ctemplate\u201d then became nothing more than a calling convention.\nThoughts?\n. Hum, unless I misses something the card description already support text emphasize using *italic* or **bold**. Not sure if we want to support that in card titles as well.\n. Hey @liuliming2008, thank you for this big pull request! You changed a lot of unrelated things (2 fixes and 5 new features if I understand it correctly). Could you put these is separate commits and rebase on top of master (currently there is some conflicts with master)? \n. Yes, sorry I meant devel, new features are implemented in devel first. Also this PR currently don't match my standards to be merged as is because:\n- There is commented code in at least 3 different places\n- 5 different features and 2 bug fixes implemented (I need to review one by one)\n- Doesn't pass eslint ./\n- Misses some comments about the modified code\n- Some copy/pasting of existing code, instead of generalization\nSo unless you can improve the quality of this submission, it will take a lot of re-work for me to get it merged.\n. For instance could you extract the code that is related to fix ie dispay bug and open a PR with it?\n. I've pulled your PR locally and tested it, and I definitely can\u2019t merge it as in because it changes too much things (including the UI) and introduces some bugs and non-consistent schemes. You also implement some features that weren\u2019t discussed before and I\u2019m not sure we want them \u2014 such as the card sorting option. I strongly recommend taking a step-by-step approach here in order to get anything merged, and I will help.\nAt least could you try to isolate the lines related to the bugs fixing and cherry-pick them in a separate PR based on devel?\n. I\u2019m really sorry but I have to close this pull request. A pull request literally mean that you ask me, the project maintainer, to pull your branch into the main one. Unfortunately as I explained above this branch changes too many things to have a chance to get merged (along with the dirty commit history, changes in the UI, etc.)\nWe will have a plugin system soon enough, I hope we will be able to re-implement most of these feature on top of it.\n. Sorry I made a mistake in my previous message, PR are effectively merged in devel.\nClosing in favor of #310.\n. Hi @rpiza, thank you for the translations! As indicated in the contributing guide I don't use GiHub Pull Request process for translations, but use Transifex \u2014 it is far more convenient for contributors and for me. I strongly encourage you to join the team on Transifex and open the catala language \u2014 your work isn\u2019t lost, you'll be able to upload the i18n JSON files.\nFeel free to ask any question here if something isn\u2019t clear :-)\n. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about building a framework for extensions/plugins developed by the community, this is definitely something I would love to do \u2014 but there are some non-trivial design decisions involved that I haven't made yet. About the \u201cvoting on card\u201d feature I received PR #310 that seems to implement it, but I can\u2019t merge it for now for the reason indicated in the PR.\n. Thank you!\n. Looks good! Before I merge this could you fix the weird space on line 18 (and git commit --amend, git push -f), and sign the CLA?\n. Related to #310.\n. Why did you close this?\n. Thanks!\n. It sounds like a bug,\n. Actually I do like that idea. I\u2019m not sure about the exact URL scheme to use (certainly we want to use /base-url/#something but the parenthesis feel a bit weird. I guess there are existing conventions for this kind of things.\n. My intuition would be more like:\n/base/url#user=mquandalle,johndoe&label=todo\nI need to verify how flow-router encode hash parameters by default.\n. You need to manually update the ROOT_URL variable to give it the URL your are will be served from (for instance https://<App Name>.herokuapp.com).\n. I've just re-tested Heroku deploy and it works for me. @vandretti are you sure that (1) you given a name to your application and (2) set ROOT_URL to https://<App Name>.herokuapp.com?\n. So it is actually a different issue than the OP\u2019s one. The cordova part is weird, we don\u2019t have any support for it and I don\u2019t see why it tries to search for things like ANDROID_HOME...\nHave you tried on the master branch?\n. Theoretically it uses the last version of the node v0.10.x branch ie Node v0.10.40 which is exactly the version we require for Wekan.\n. Is this resolved?\n. hi @maikeldus, thank you for the bug report. This issue is fixed on devel. I don\u2019t know when I will release Wekan v0.10 but if you don\u2019t want to wait you can follow https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/133#issuecomment-146691959.\n. Actually the URL parsing already takes place before the emojies one, but it then get overwritten by it \u2014 the code is here.\nThis probably need a larger refactoring about how we handled enhanced inputs.\n. Agreed\n. What version of Safari is that? (I don't have Mac to test this bug, I will need to ask someone)\n. Thank you!\n. Hi @dialogik,\nWekan will automatically migrate your data on first launch. The way to upgrade depends on the installation method you have initially chosen:\n- if you use docker, you'll have one docker container for the database and one container for the application. You'll need to stop the old application container, replace it by the new one and start it again;\n- if you used \u201craw-installation\u201d, you need to stop the nodejs server, download the wekan application and start again the nodejs server\n@PrestonL explanations work in the case you used the meteor tool to launch the application, ie (git pull https://github.com/wekan/wekan.git && meteor). In this case the database is located in the wekan/.meteor/local/db subdirectory and as Preston said you'll need to copy it to your new application folder. This installation way is not recommended for production use because you won\u2019t get some of the production optimization you normally get with the other methods (code minification, gzip compression, etc.)\nThe entire state of the application is persisted in the mongo database (we don't touch any file for instance).\nWhat installation method did you use @dialogik?\n. So Sandstorm upgrades work automatically. You need to go the the sandstom app market and click on the install button of Wekan. Then Sandstorm will tell you that this application is already installed on your server and ask you if you want to upgrade it. I imagine Sandstorm team plan to improve the UX here, so feel free to talk to them if you find this upgrade process confusing (cc @kentonv).\n. The docker container only contains the Wekan application but not its associated Mongo database. You need to provide a URL to a Mongo database using the MONGO_URL environment variable, as the error tells you. As you already use docker, one easy way to run this database is to use the official mongodb docker image:\ndocker run -d --name wekan-db mongo\ndocker run -d --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e ROOT_URL=http://example.com\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan\nYou can also use docker-compose to run these two containers at once.\n. This was actually fixed as a side effect of 98d7278d and will be released in the upcoming v0.10.\n. Here are my current ideas about the plugin system. Plugins will be distributed as packages that could execute any code on the server or the client. The meteor format (\u201cisopackages\u201d) would probably fit the requirements here but I need to find a way to download them from a market-store like repository, start them and execute them at application runtime, and restrict the execution to certain boards \u2014 because most plugins will be enabled at the board level. Whether I end up using the Meteor format or something else, I will definitely rely on some third party package system here as I don\u2019t want to re-implement the abstract logic of a package manager (eg, versions resolutions). So that\u2019s for the \u201cload some third party code in the app\u201d.\nAbout the UI API I would like to take inspiration from the Atom Service API, http://blog.atom.io/2015/03/25/new-services-API.html. Since switching to React is in the plan (see #299) it will probably be better to rely on React render logic to implement the UI extensions mechanisms. It seems that high order components are the recommended way in React, but I\u2019m surprised that no one did implement a UI extend-able by third parties plugins using React (yet).\n. I published a general overview of the desired plugin system: https://discuss.wekan.io/t/rfc-the-plugin-system/132/1. Super curious of what people think of this proposal and I will be happy to discuss it in more details on the forum.\nThis desired system will be built incrementally, at first we won\u2019t have any distribution mechanism but will just start refactoring existing features into internal proto-plugins. That will help set a working API. I will try to have a first proto-plugin by the end of this week.\n. Hi @jimmiebtlr,\nThank you very much for this PR. My intuition is that we should be able to customize the set of plugins we use at the board level.\nI will probably merge this in a separate branch so I can continue to experiment with this architecture. The CLA is pretty common is open-source project, it says that you keep the copyright of your work but you give me a license to give me the right use it.\n. We are not going to use Meteor packages as the basis of our plugin system, but instead will rely on NPM. I published an overview of the desired plugin system here: https://discuss.wekan.io/t/rfc-the-plugin-system/132/1\nAs you worked on such a system for Wekan, I would be curious to read your thoughts on my proposal.\n. I can\u2019t reproduce this in v0.10-rc4 (you can try at https://wekan.io/sign-in). I plan to refactor the whole allow and deny and mutation thing soon so this sort of bug would be less likely to happen.\n. Not yet\n. Yes, but I don\u2019t have any ETA. Will close this in favor of #146.\n. Hi Nolan,\nSorry for the late response. As I have no experience building applications for blind users, you\u2019re feedback and recommendations are greatly appreciated. The points you have listed are reasonably easy to fix and well explained so I should be able to tackle them. You are right when you say that a reusable template/component would be the good approach instead to keep things DRY and avoid forgetting aria-label and such on future UI modifications. \nGoing forward I wonder how far we can go to make \u201cvisual task management\u201d for blind users, that\u2019s sound a quite interesting challenge :) If I remember correctly it is possible to provide further semantics using aria to indicate \u201cthis is a menu\u201d, \u201cthis is a menu item\u201d, etc. I guess we should also have a action button to move card without using drag and drop (as does Trello in the card actions).\nThank you for your help to figure out these issues :-)\n. The implementation looks good @FuzzyWuzzie, thank you! I would like to improve the following points before merging this feature:\n- Pressing Escape when the autocomplete menu is open should close the autocomplete menu, not the entire card\n- Pressing Enter when the card only contains some meta-data (eg @username) and no title should not close the card and lose its content but instead should keep the card open it does when I press Enter on an empty card.\nKenton please tell me if you don\u2019t have the time or if you don\u2019t want to handle these modifications, in this case I will work on them :-)\n. Good idea @FuzzyWuzzie, it looks good. Putting the styles in forms.styl isn\u2019t particularly wrong (CSS in fundamentally a mess anyway :p, I'm seriously considering inline style with React components but that\u2019s a bit of topic). After a second thought I think they are additional things to consider:\n- I think we should display color names in a lighter grey (like it is done in the filter view \u2014 in the sidebar) to visually indicate that these are names we chosen by default because the actual label doesn\u2019t have a name;\n- Colors should be translated in the user language, but since it\u2019s currently not done in the filter view, I can merge without it.\n- See also my inline comment about color auto-completion on named labels\n. I think that the autocomplete action doesn\u2019t behave as expected, and believe the way #351 did implement it (which is also how Trello behaves) is better. The thing is that when I press tab to add @Kenton I would prefer to add the Kenton member object to the card, which is materialized as an avatar on the bottom right, rather than the string @Kenton in the textarea. This approach also solves some edge cases with the current approach (for instance which label should we choose if I insert #blue and there are multiple blue labels? Answer: the one that was selected on the autocomplete menu which mean that we need to remove the serialization and parsing step).\n@FuzzyWuzzie Do you want me to work on that?\n. Hum you are right. We could have a dedicated Popover to customize the set of members (or labels) by clicking on one of them (as we do in the card pane) which would require the mouse. We can also remove using the keyboard only by \u201cadding it again\u201d, which mean that selecting an item in the autocomplete menu actually toggle it \u2014 which is what Trello does. I guess in this case we need to have a visual indication on the autocomplete menu that the item is already added and that its selection will remove it, such as a \u2714 postfix.\n. Kenton do you need help to finish this feature?\n. Yay! Finally got this merged, and this will be available in the next release of Wekan. Thank you @FuzzyWuzzie! \n. Hi Kenton,\nSorry I didn\u2019t answer before. I fully support having some keyboard shortcuts to fill the card meta-data. Your implementation in #342 seems to be on the perfect track. I\u2019ll review the code later today. Thanks :-)\n. I\u2019m closing this assuming #342 solved the issue.\n. Thank you :)\n. Updating packages in easy enough, I think I can do it myself, thanks :-)\n. @radomici You are right, this was reported in #349, let\u2019s keep the issues separate.\n. @kentonv I was able to share a Wekan grain upgraded from LibreBoard using the share link (without edit mode as you realized). Do you have any further indication to help me reproduce this bug?\nBy the way there isn\u2019t really a \u201cusername/password mode\u201d, the page is still there we just don\u2019t display it. I guess it\u2019s possible to see this form if the grain URL is changed to home /, but I don\u2019t know how this would happen.\n. The redirection is done on the server side (here). This HTTP redirection isn\u2019t enforced if the client modifies the URL to / (which shouldn\u2019t be possible from the UI).\n. You can upload it here, or send me an e-mail if you prefer something else.\n. Thanks, I was able to reproduce the issue with it.\n. The iframe URL is of the form https://alpha-xxx.sandstorm.io/_sandstorm-init?sessionid=xxx&path=/. That URL seems to come from the Sandstom shell, do you know if that is supposed to redirect @kentonv?\n. Well actually that seems to be expected.\n. Ok, I got it, it was an easy one.\nLibreBoard v0.8 didn\u2019t implement the Sandstorm sharing model (which didn\u2019t exist at the release time) and instead kept the visibility setting (\u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d) in the UI as does the main Meteor application. On Wekan v0.9 access is now handled by Sandstorm itself so the board is created \u201cpublic\u201d and the button to change that visibility setting has been removed from the UI. It turns out that if you changed the visibility to \u201cprivate\u201d on LibreBoard v0.8, it will stay private in Wekan v0.9 because I forgot to include a migration to change it. I\u2019ll include such a migration in the next release of Wekan. Meanwhile @radomici, if you need to share by link a \u201cprivate\u201d Wekan board, you can:\n1. open the Wekan grain with the owner account that has access to it\n2. open the console in the debuggers tool and select the appropriate grain frame (something like https://domain.com/b/sansdstorm/libreboard)\n3. run\njs\n   Boards.update('sandstorm', {$set: {permission: 'public'}})\n4. You should now be able to share this grain with the Sandstorm sharing link\n. I think I just copied this code from a pre-blaze-components era.\n. Hum, I didn\u2019t realize that I forgot to implement the sharing permissions in case the sandstorm user isn\u2019t identified. \nWekan currently assumes that a board member at least has a name (to be displayed in the activity feed). I\u2019m not sure what to display for unlogged users (something like \u201cUnamed user 1\u201d?). Also if the user edits the board in unlogged mode, and then logs in, how would I be able to reconcile the two identities? Do you have any clue @kentonv?\n. Reading a HTTP header is easy enough, don\u2019t worry :) The difficult part is that I really rely on board members (people that can edit it) being present in the user collection. So I guess I may create a new user everytime someone fetch the grain using a share link, but that will create a lot of dead users in the collection and in the UI (members shown on the sidebar).\nMaybe one other possibility would be to create one single member for all the people accessing the grain from a given link. This user would have a name (${linkName} user?) and permissions (the link permissions) and would be displayed accordingly in the sidebar and the activity feeds. Does that sound reasonable to you Kenton?\n. Yes that\u2019s another solution, but I\u2019m afraid it is currently not possible to have an actionable sign-in link/button to display the appropriate Sandstorm popover.\n. I think only the grain owner has to pay for it.\n. (cf.  #352)\n. I haven\u2019t read the whole conversation again, but in the case of Wekan-like apps that want to track what each user is doing, the app could restrict unregistered users to read-only access as proposed above https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/349#issuecomment-146574181. Any problem with that?\n. @zertrin What I was just saying is that for certain applications like Wekan, the user will need to be registered and logged in to make some edit\u2014and that\u2019s because we need to accurately associate actions to their author identity. So far that\u2019s no different from having to create a Trello account to edit a Trello board.\nOn Sandstrom the authentication layer is handled by the platform, not the app, which among other advantages is good because it dispenses you from creating new accounts for every single app you want to use. This also means that the user you want to invite on a board will have to be registered and logged into the Sandstorm host.\nFor this to work in term of user experience, you would have either to share by identity (in which case the relative is already registered in the host and everything works fluently), or share by link. In this latter case the UI would have to display something like \u201csign in/log in to edit this board\u201d which isn\u2019t currently implemented (@kentonv does Sandstorm now allows an app to open the Sandstorm login form?).\n. Thank you @hsduk for this PR. I\u2019m not sure if I want to support that in core because that sounds like a specific use case that would make the base product more complex. Instead I would like to create a public API that would allow this kind of features via a plugin system. What do you think?\n. Hey @mariusbuescher, thank you for this PR. There is an on-going work to implement this feature in #342, could you take a look at it?\n. Related: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/1027\n. Hi Xavier,\nOur coding style is already handled by ESLint which has a lot more rules that the .editorconfig you propose here. I don\u2019t see the point of supporting it given that\n- you have to configure (or at least test) ESLint to contribute (otherwise your PR will get rejected by our CI);\n- as far as I know, ESLint has far more traction than Editor Config \u2014 at least in the JS/ES community\n- I don\u2019t want to maintain two separate set of rules.\nI believe it is better for the project to be opinionated on this kind of non-fundamental issues. Unless you have a strong objection I will close this.\n. Ok that makes sense. Thanks for the PR and argumentation, let\u2019s try editorconfig!\n. I use Sublime Text on Ubuntu \u2014 which I wouldn\u2019t qualify as an IDE by the way.\n. I tried Webstorm at least 2 times but got back to Sublime :-)\n. Interestingly our friends at Rocket.chat (also an open-source Meteor application) encounter the same issue at https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/1111\n. Hi Xavier,\nThank you for the PR! The code looks good to me. Apart from my tiny inline comments there is one bigger change I would like to consider with you before merging this PR. I don\u2019t know how much you are familiar with Meteor, but basically there are two paths to mutate the database, one is using Meteor.methods that are basically RPC (but with potential optimistic update on the client) and the other is using minimongo operations (like we everywhere in Wekan). The thing is that with minimongo .insert we enforce some constants, for instance we ensure that the createdAt date is correct (here) but in the case of the card import it is probably better to trust the data we are importing (or at least ensure a set of different rules that we would normally do). So I propose to do the import in a Meteor Method, because it makes it easy to chose which validation rule we want to enforce.\nDoes that makes sense?\n. I guess models/cards.js \u2014 but we\u2019ll probably want to split this file later on.\n. Ok, but name if import.js because at some point we\u2019ll be able to import data exported from Wekan as well :-)\n. (Or even #152 :-))\n. I think only \u201cimportCard\u201d will be less confusing.\n. Tested and it works well! Thank you Xavier, I\u2019m ready to merge. Maybe could you just git rebase -i  21dcd16 and squashes some of the commits (for instance \u201cfix eslint style\u201d) and git push -f so we get a cleaner git history?\n. Yep something went wrong, I'll fix and merge.\n. Merged in b670a1ab36fcf514751e4b356487a96088dbbd24, thanks!\n. This bug is fixed on devel.\n. I don\u2019t think this is a desirable feature for now. Closing this feature, as it could be very easily re-implemented once we have the plugin system.\n. At a first glance the code (and its commit history) looks very good, I\u2019m super happy to review that and get it merged in core, thank you :-)\n. On a side note do you think something like https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr would be useful (for instance to import all the members at once)?\n. Ok, makes sense.\n. I have a bug when importing old boards (in my case 2013). From my investigations the cause seems to be that Trello didn\u2019t have a createList action back at the time \u2014 which raise an error because the createdAt date of the list is then undefined.\n. I fixed this issue by providing a default date.\nThis is now merged in devel. Thank you very much once again!\n. Hi Jonathan,\nIt\u2019s great that you are willing to try it :-) I think you will have to:\n- Add a li tag for \u201cno member\u201d on the sidebar in https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/client/components/sidebar/sidebarFilters.jade#L7 (same thing for \u201cno label\u201d);\n- Add the corresponding event handler when the user click on the link you just added above, https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/client/components/sidebar/sidebarFilters.js#L6.\n- Implement the filtering logic in the filter.js library https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/client/lib/filter.js \u2014 the goal of this lib is to generate a query selector from a set of filters;\nIf something isn\u2019t clear feel free to ask (here or on the gitter chat) :-)\n. Did you get a chance to start something @jseadragon?\n. That\u2019s a good idea! Yes, having a variable in the HTML <head> is not that easy on Meteor (but I\u2019m pretty sure there are good packages to do set the page reactively). I\u2019ll take a look.\n. https://github.com/tomwasd/flow-router-seo/ looks reasonable.\n. Hum, or maybe https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-dochead\n. Closing in favor of #443.\n. Thanks!\n. Yes, you should add it to the list of authorized globals, https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/31b60d82fcae64a844805a2a76a0af25fb9c16c2/.eslintrc#L83\n. I\u2019ve put some inline comments about stylistic issues but anyway I won\u2019t merge this issue as is. The feature is completely bugged (at least on Firefox), and even if it worked I\u2019m not sure about the UX.\n. @dferber90 could you confirm that I should revert these changes given that you abandoned meteor-eslint?\n. Hey don\u2019t be sorry for \u201cthe noise\u201d, Meteor-specific static analysis using ESLint was a great initiative even if the ever moving JS ecosystem and the lack of MDG broke your work and has discouraged you. I just wanted to confirm that I should remove it in Wekan to prevent contributors experiencing known bugs.\n. This bug is due to the way Meteor bundle CSS files, I proposed a fix in https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/5841.\n. I was slightly wrong on the problem description, I reported the bug to CollectionFs with a corrected explanation at https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS/issues/884.\n. Hi @floatinghotpot,\nThank you for this PR, it looks great and I\u2019ll be happy to merge it. I\u2019ve written some relatively easy to fix (or answer) inline comments, and I\u2019ll appreciate if you could take a look at them.\nI also think that the preview should be on a separate popup displayed after the click on \u201cClipboard\u201d (Popup.open(\"clipboardPreview\")) and have a small text that explain what it does \u2014 \u201cThe following image is available in you clipboard, do you whish to attach it to this card\u201d (or any better wording really).\n. And we should also handle the case when there is no image the clipboard correctly \u2014 currently it only displays a broken image.\n. Thanks for improving your PR, I\u2019ll do a second review pass. However I\u2019m not managing non-English translations via GitHub PRs (that would be difficult) but instead we use Transifex. So I encourage you to upload your Chinese file to Transifex (they may be some updates there since the last time I pulled the translations, I do that before each release), and could you please remove them from these PR (you can git --amend, git push -f).\n. Thanks for improving your PR!\nI\u2019m very confused by the broken image by default:\n\nCould you remove it if there is no valid image to display? Also I would to instructions on first line (before the image) and add some vertical margin. The button should also have the class name .primary.\n. It\u2019s all good, I expect to merge your PR this week-end :)\n. Yes, my family and friends are safe. I\u2019m not currently in France (I\u2019m in San Francisco) but I spent a lot of time watching the news and calling my relatives this week-end and I haven\u2019t worked at all.\n. Thank you for the bug report. I\u2019m considering removing that option in favor of the more-flexible multisection workflow: you can click \u201cSelect all cards in this list\u201d on the list menu and then on the sidebar \u201cArchive selection\u201d. That\u2019s one more click but I feel that archiving all cards of a list isn\u2019t a very common task so doing it in two clicks is reasonable, and I also want to encourage the usage of MultiSelection for this kind of operation.\nWhat do you think?\n. You can click right on the attachment and \u201cCopy link\u201d.\n. Didn\u2019t know simple:json-routes, but from a quick look at it and given that is developed by MDG core members that seems like a pretty good choice. I also agree that redirect to the JSON document itself is a good idea for an export.\n. This was also my impressions on the matter, I agree with Xavier about the need for our own format. This will become even more required once we implement the plugin ecosystem that will probably differ significantly from what Trello currently have (and Trello format hasn\u2019t be designed to be re-used by third party software anyway). \nXavier feel free to share some of the design considerations about the export format once you had the time to figure them out.\n. Though the downside of having our own format is that people won\u2019t be able to import a Wekan board into Trello... But I guess if it is a highly requested feature someone could write a JSON from Wekan to JSON of Trello transpiler at some point.\n. Oh woah I forgot that! Maybe with the Entreprise edition? (or maybe if you contact the support by e-mail?). Anyway you are right, so Wekan to Trello imports are even less a concern than what I initially thought.\n. I wonder if we should denormalize the data as Trello does (with the re-normalization task at import time) or if could generate something more like clasical database exports where we can refer to previous document using their identifier. For that we could even use a format like Netflix JsonGraph (or similar) which would potentially provide some integration with some third party tools and libraries.\n. I searched for JsonGraph alternatives but wasn\u2019t able to find any popular project (but people complaining that the JSON spec should have references... it\u2019s right :-)).\nJsonGraph is indeed a little bit verbose (I guess using a {$ref: 'refId'} would be enough for references) but that\u2019s not really a problem. I think that having a clear document like the one I linked above to explain the reference format is an advantage for potential third parties implementors. In a further future we may also use GraphQL here for now I would say that it would be over-engineering.\n. JsonAPI seems explicitly designed in the context of a request-response architecture. It looks good for designing an actual API but isn\u2019t that a bit overkill for a simple reference convention in our exports? (BTW seeing Steve Klabnik as an author is reassuring, and they seems to be a fair number of implementations).\n. (on my phone in a bar right now, so sorry for the somehow short response) Maybe option 2, but replacing FlowRouter by Picker? Not sure if the Auth will be automatic but I'm pretty sure there is a reasonable way to make it work. \n. Yes it is logical since generally speaking HTTP is only used as an client-agnostic distribution protocol in Meteor, and the actual authenticated communications between the server and the client happen on DDP. However, I know that @arunoda\u2019s FastRender was able to serve authenticated HTTP using a classical HTTP cookie (meteor_login_token). I\u2019m pretty sure that we could re-use that token to authenticated a specific HTTP route.\nIf I understand correctly Filesaver works iff the client has all the required data (all activities, comments, etc.)? If yes, I guess it\u2019s still worth to investigate server-side generation for the export.\n. I think we don\u2019t send the activity feed in the general board view publication as of today.\nAt some point we will also have better efficiency (\u00e0 la Facebook/Relay) about the amount of data we send to the client \u2014 for instance there is no point in sending all the cards comments just to being able to compute the number of comments on a card client side; we already feeling the lag because of that on large boards like the Meteor Roadmap.\n. Thank you for that, I\u2019m super happy that people like you can hack Wekan for their needs and get some changes merged back. I\u2019ll have to do a careful review of each feature to see how they fit in my plans for Wekan (especially I\u2019d like to design a plugin system, so I need to think about what should be in core and what to expose to plugins to make the kind of features developers and users want possible). Expect to read a more specific review from me soon.\n. Let\u2019s move to #119.\n. Hum, I suspect something is wrong on the server side, could you share the Sandstorm grain logs (if any)?\n. Hey Xavier, thank you very much for yet another great contribution :-) I\u2019ll review it this week-end.\n. Hey Xavier,\nSorry for the long delay, I\u2019m currently traveling and I\u2019m not as productive as I would like (as you can see in my GitHub profile calendar). This is now merged, thank you again :-)\n. Postponed the focus issue since there is a high chance that we move away from Blaze to React (see #299) sooner than latter which would change the rendering engine runtime, let's keep the XXX comment as you did for now.\n. Hey @mnutt, I didn\u2019t know about this Sandstorm feature. I will look at the exact rooting scheme we need for Sandstorm.\n. Hi, this is now implemented in devel, thank you for the help!\nI tried to change the routing scheme for the Sandstorm version, especially by removing the board name from it since the grain contain a single board, but that introduces some ambiguity with other routes (for instance we need to be sure that the /shortcuts route doesn\u2019t match a /:cardId route, which it does not currently because the card route is /b/:boardId/:cardId. I still would like to clean the path a little bit but I first need to set some redirection mechanism for old URLs.\n. It is better to wait for the new release (or at least the release canditate). I don\u2019t have any definite plan since I\u2019m traveling and working at the same time, but devel has enough new features to publish a new release so I\u2019ll work on that very soon.\n. Hi @abdennour,\nThank you for translating Wekan into Arabic. I manage Wekan translations using Transifex which is easier for both contributors and me for a lot of common translations related tasks. There is an arabic language in Transifex but he currently doesn\u2019t have any translation in it. Would you mind joining the Arabic team and uploading your translations (you don\u2019t need to write them again, you can just upload the JSON file you created).\n. I uploaded your translation file in Transifex (which has a syntax error L84 BTW) and merged it as part of d4581afd9b520dd034ea75f6e1ed0ab06bd67b5f, thank you very much :-)\n. Hi Xavier, I actually answered in #331, feel free to continue the discussion there.\n. Hi @SirCmpwn, thank you for this contribution. I agree with the rationale and I'll be happy to merge it once I'll be back on my computer. \nSigning the CLA doesn't \u201csign away yours rights\u201d, you always keep the authorship of the code you write. By signing the CLA you basically:\n- Declare that you are the owner of the PR code (or that the actual owner gives you the right to do so) \n- Give the project owner (me) a perpetual license to use your code in the project (so that you cannot purse me for doing so) \nOnce again, you keep the ownership of the code you write, and the CLA is a way to give me the right to use your code. Does that seems reasonable to you @SirCmpwn? If yes I should maybe write an introduction to better explain the purpose of the CLA, I understand that a user making an effort to implement a new feature to Wekan can be reluctant to blindly sign some bunch of esoteric juridical paragraphs. Maybe we could discuss this issue on the forum (I would also like to read what other contributors that have signed the CLA did think of it)? \n. Hi @SirCmpwn, I merged your contribution, thank you for it.\n\nOn the license discussion I think the problem is here:\n\nthe MIT license which I've made my code available\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly true that if you release your code under the MIT license there is no issue to re-use it in Wekan or elsewhere. The issue is that contributors usually don\u2019t attach a license to their contributions \u2014 even if Wekan is distributed under the MIT license, if you modify one file somewhere there is no reason to assume a priori that your changes are MIT licensed. That\u2019s why the CLA is here (and if you want I can provide a list of popular open-source project requiring contributors to sign this exact same kind of document \u2014 starting with meteor-core itself). I understand that it can be inconvenient, but I believe using https://cla-assistant.io simplify the process a lot, you can sign the CLA with your GitHub account in one single click (compare it with Odoo CLAs for instance).\n. The CLA is a protection for the project maintainer against someone pursing him for re-using its work without permission. If you have no intention to do that, that\u2019s good for you and me and you can deduce that the CLA is useless for you. But a malicious contributor might also argue that its contribution isn\u2019t covered by the Wekan MIT license and in this case the project maintainer is in a better position if he forced this contributor to sign an explicit consent to the usage of its code via the CLA.\n. The Wekan code is published under the MIT license, not necessary third-party contributions. I didn\u2019t invent the CLA system, I\u2019m just following others here.\n. No for sure, but for this kind of issue, I don\u2019t think it is completely non-sense to follow the big open-source players. Convince them that the CLA is useless and I will follow in the other way (I for one persist in thinking that the third-party contributors should explicitly authorize the main project to use their code)\n. I would be happy to merge your future contributions :-)\n. Hi Nolan,\nThank you for contributing! Actually this issue was already resolved in 3f7df34 but the fix isn\u2019t released yet.\n. Yes 3f7df34 is in devel, so I guess there is an issue remaining. Sorry for closing this issue without a proper investigation. I guess the PR you are referring to is #338. By the way, devel is indeed the current state of things, and master is the last released version (currently v0.9).\n. I\u2019m all for adding href=\"#\" to links if that improve the situation on screen readers, I just don\u2019t think that adding them manually to every link in every template is the correct solution because we will likely forget to add some (whether now or in the future) and in case we want to do something else in the future in make evolution harder.\nCommit 3f7df34 was supposed to fix that problem by automating the insertion of a href=\"#\" to links that doesn\u2019t have a href already, and I verified that it worked by opening the Developers Tools and looking for this href attributes in the DOM. I don\u2019t know how to reproduce the exact problem that we are facing, what screen reader are you using?\n. Well 3f7df340e1dea4a48bd17c189ccf61e53c47330a is also supposed to automatically add aria-label on both <a> links and <i> icons...\n. > Automation is nice but it isn't working here.\nSo 3f7df34 is doing two things:\n- Add a href=\"#\" attribute to links that doesn\u2019t have it already\n- Add a aria-label to icons and links that have a title set\nI think these two features are working as expected. The problem is that we need to set some title/aria-label from every relevant element (but this PR only add href=\"#\" to links). Did you say that you have a PR ready to do just that @ndarilek?\n. For icons aria-labels we could use https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-accessible-fa, considering that I plan to switch to React soon after v0.10, cf. #299.\n. I\u2019m closing this PR as there the proposed modifications are already implemented. I\u2019ll report the rest of my accessibility work in #408.\n. Thanks!\n. This is fixed in the upcoming v0.10.\n. As @xavierpriour discussed in #406 I believe that this kind of import feature should be distributed as Wekan plugin rather than being a core feature (maybe CSV import could still be a core feature, but people have also been requesting less standard imports like in #152).\nHowever since this plugin infrastructure currently doesn\u2019t exist, I will be happy to merge this PR. Then when we get plugins, we might refactor some Wekan core features to put them in plugins. \nThanks for this!\n. I actually plan to remove the \u201cmove all cards in this list\u201d and \u201carchive all cards in this list\u201d action from the list menu if favor of the multi-selection feature. I think it would make sense to do the same for the CSV export feature. Basically we would have a link in the sidebar below \u201cArchive selection\u201d, like \u201cExport to CSV\u201d. It would add a single click to achieve the effect that is currently implemented (ie, exporting a single list by clicking \u201cSelect all cards in this list\u201d and then \u201cExport to CSV\u201d) but provide much more flexibility to customize the exact set of cards that the users want to export. Thoughts?\n. Again, sorry for not having merge that already @floatinghotpot. I would also like to merge this feature as a build in plugin, but I need to have a minimal version of the plugin system first. I will work on that as soon as Meteor release a working version of the ES6 import/export and will help you in the adaptation process.\nI think this is actually having actual feature not yet in core but already implemented will actually help designing the requirements and APIs of the module system.\n. Should be fixed by e551d06 which will be released in the upcoming v0.10.\n. Should be fixed in the upcoming v0.10.\n. Thank you very much for your reactivity Xavier, I\u2019ll be able demo this feature tomorrow :-)\n. Thank you very much for your reactivity Xavier, I\u2019ll be able demo this feature tomorrow :-)\n. :+1: This is an excellent idea, thank you :)\n. Hi Raymond,\nThis is a feature I planned to implement for a long time, so I\u2019m super happy with this PR :-) I haven\u2019t pulled the code locally yet, but just from reading the source I think this feature misses a notion of \u201cverified user\u201d which would be required to show a special notice on invited members details popover like \u201cThis member has been invited but haven\u2019t joined yet\u201d. What do you think?\n. Hum I didn\u2019t get that you had implemented this pre-member list from my too short look at the code. It sounds good to me, I\u2019ll pull locally and provide a complete review.\n. Ok I see the problem. Meteor always has this non-clear story about how we should update the data, I created my own layer (the Collection.mutations thing) on top of minimongo calls, but I plan to refactor that once the new Meteor guide gives its recommendations. For now I would say that we should use simples Meteor method for the two use cases that you outlined. You can define them in the model/board.js and be sure to enforce security checks because allow and deny rules aren\u2019t enforced for Meteor methods.\n. Tested locally, and the invitation process was totally smooth, this is very good :) Please just consider my inline comments and I\u2019ll merge as is.\n. Thank you very much for your fast responses! This is now merged (and I plan to release v0.10-RC tomorrow with it).\n. It might be an issue with the Websocket proxy ngnix configuration. Could you share the relevant configuration block? \n. Well, writing a title is not enough. You should explain what you mean exactly, why you want this feature, and how you plan to use it.\n. Thanks @mfaure, fixed.\n. I thought I pulled zh-CN translations, but I may have done something wrong. No, there isn\u2019t any review process required for now. Anyway don\u2019t worry @floatinghotpot there is still work to be done for v0.10 (including merging your PR!) so I\u2019ll release more release candidates in the coming days (I\u2019ll pull translations from Transifex before every RC).\n. You can now test the next RC using the deployed instance at https://wekan.io/sign-in (it may be a little slow as the server is located in France, I will configure a CDN).\n. Released v0.10-rc2.\n. Released v0.10-rc4 which includes some bug fixes, an adapted UI for mobile, and the possibility to export a board to JSON. It\u2019s deployed at https://wekan.io/sign-in.\nI plan to release the final 0.10 on December the 22th.\n. Released\n. Hum I didn\u2019t realize I merged the 'x' index because I was doubtful about it. I\u2019m glad you improved the implementation in this PR. Any reason you re-used the isActive flag instead of creating a isInvited? How do we distinguish between invited members (that are not yet board members) and former members (that are no longer board members)?\n. Ok thank you for the clarification.\n. Yes, this feature would be interesting but it is already tracked in #55. Closing in favor of the original topic.\n. @xavierpriour, I plan to change the import flow to make it linear:\nstep 1: chose the import format\nstep 2: upload the data\nstep 3: member mapping\nthen loading bar, or spinner\nI\u2019ve just realized that this changes the flow currently implemented when you go back and forth between step 2 and 3, but I think this is a pretty reasonable model.\nI imagine the UI should have a horizontal component showing the process progress. Clicking on a previous step should bring the user back to it. On the implementation side, all the import data would be saved under the import root component and not in the individual step components, which is a easier model to reason about. I imagine in the future, third-parties importers will be able to customize the steps, and add more if needed.\nI\u2019ve also been blindly refactoring the client-side import code, but I\u2019m not sure if I do things correctly :-/\nAlso, as the actual import \u201cbusiness logic\u201d is located in the models/ directory, so it is distributed in both the client and the server, which means that the importTrelloBoard method runs on both the environments. Is that on purpose? It seems unnecessary heavy to me to run the latency compensation method on the client, especially since we are waiting for server completion with a spinner anyway.\n. I need to look closer at the client side method performance for latency compensation, but I was under the impression that it freezes the client for a few seconds if you import large boards. Otherwise, yes, why not.\n. @xavierpriour this should be completed as a basic UI change from popup to full screen, it also fixes #504. Could you take a quick look?\n. Ok thank you for the hint. Are you aware of any convenient way to log the DDP messages, like added or ready, on the server side, to verify if these are generated correctly?\n. Hi @reywood, did you already used FastRender on a PublishComposite publication? Any idea why it wouldn\u2019t work?\n. I didn\u2019t figured out the exact method name yet :-) BTW, the publishComposite function is pretty simple: https://github.com/englue/meteor-publish-composite/blob/5bf1e1e741a6dbf544be148e6288a99971df75aa/lib/publish_composite.js#L1-L22\n. Hum, and there is a Meteor.publishComposite.enableDebugLogging(), let\u2019s try that.\n. The version deployed on https://wekan.io is 0.10-RC1 which doesn\u2019t contain your #426 fix. If you look at the board data using Boards.findOne(Session.get('currentBoard')) you\u2019ll see that there is indeed a member with userId \"x\".\nI assume that upgrading to RC2 won\u2019t solve this issue automatically, what function should I run to clean the data?\n. Fixed in RC2.\n. I\u2019m curious why you consider the second activity description as correct but not the first one. Anyway I think a better description would be:\n1. (at the card level) ${user} joined this card\n2. (at the board level) ${user} joined ${cardName}\n. Got it!\n. Well, it\u2019s not yet possible to import the JSON export just yet. It should be fairly easy to implement though, we\u2019ll have it for Wekan 0.11 due on February 4.\n. I wasn\u2019t able to make some progress in #430 this week-end as I wanted to, but I still this is the branch in which this development should take place. Basically we will have a full screen multi-step import, the first step being to select the import format, and then a various number of additional steps depending on the data format.\n. I think that it would be more efficient to avoid a \u201cwrite UI as a popup\u201d \u2192 \u201crefactor into a different UI\u201d path (especially given the Meteor 10-15s iteration time with UI components). What about just writing the server-side import method (that you can test simply by calling Meteor.call('importWekanBoard', {...}) from the browser console)?\n. I just find strange to qualify as \u201clazy\u201d the fact of writing an UI instead of using the browser console :-p If you write a command in the console, like Meteor.call('something' somethingElse);, and then modify the something method to fix some bug, you can simply press the \u2191 key to replay the last console command. I believe this is as efficient as you can get, or do I miss something?\n. Anyway, I\u2019m just arguing on the principle, but go with the UI if you feel that it is a better way :)\n. (a bit off topic; but I think the real issue here is the Meteor iteration time, if we had React hot replacement writing UI would be a breeze. Switching to a stack that support this 1s iteration (React + Webpack on top of Meteor) will probably be the first thing I will experiment with just after the 0.10 release.)\n. Woah, I didn\u2019t expect that to go that fast! It looks great from the screenshots. I\u2019m super excited to review and merge that :)\n. Hi @hikoseuro,\nThank you for improving the Russian translation. I manage Wekan translations using Transifex which is more appropriate than GitHub Pull Requests for a lot of common translations related tasks (for both contributors and me). There is already a Russian team on Transifex, would you mind joining it and uploading your translations (you don\u2019t need to write them again, you can just upload the JSON file you created).\n. I uploaded your translation file in Transifex and merged it as part of 94e57dc, thank you very much :-)\n. Hi @Zyko0,\nI will be happy to merge one click deploy to Scalingo. I just tried it but encountered the following error:\n\nSomething bad happened! Back-end is offline :( \n\nI guess this is just temporary.\n. I couldn\u2019t reproduce the error as of today. @Soulou, I\u2019m on Linux/Ubuntu + Firefox 43 \u2014 but I doubt this is related.\nAnyway, this is ready to merge.\n. @alayek is actually working on improving this flow, I don\u2019t have all the details but it\u2019s probably better to keep this issue open for now.\n. This is very cool, thank you so much for working on that @floatinghotpot. Please consider my inline comments.\n. Perfect! Thank you very much for the feature and for implementing my recommendations :-) \n. Hum, I didn\u2019t see that you changed the board header bar layout on desktop. I would prefer to keep it unchanged on desktop (it\u2019s perfect on mobile), cf.\n\n. This is actually a duplicate of #365, but I\u2019ll keep it open due to a clearer description of the issue.\n. Thank you!\n. Oh woah, let\u2019s use maxime[dot]quandalle[at]gmail[dot]com.\n. See #320\n. Does that help?\n. Generally speaking I would remove the notion of a \u201cboard template\u201d from the code base in favor of simpler \u201cclone\u201d feature, I exposed this idea in https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/308#issuecomment-141135503.\nI\u2019m also experimenting (for the first time with this PR) with a new code review application. It has happen a few times that I put a comment on a GitHub PR, and then the code change so GitHub hide the comment whereas it\u2019s still not addressed. So we will see if Reviewable.io improve things or not, feel free to comment if you have an opinion on this :-)\n\nReviewed 4 of 4 files at r1.\nReview status: all files reviewed at latest revision, 6 unresolved discussions.\n\nclient/components/boards/boardHeader.jade, line 85 [r1] (raw file):\nNot saying this is fundamentally better but you can avoid the creation of a custom helper here by using `($.Session.equals 'currentBoard' _id) which is provided by raix:handlebar-helpers.\nAnyway this whole class of issues will disappear with the soon to come migration to React.\n\nclient/components/boards/boardHeader.js, line 218 [r1] (raw file):\nHum, why do you have to use that?

So first of all I have to apologize to @floatinghotpot because I did the code review before actually running the code on my machine as I was excited to test Reviewable (I\u2019m happy with it BTW, it allows me to keep track of sub issues in a better way and it supports git rebasing). So I actually misunderstood this feature as being a \u201cfull clone\u201d feature whereas it is actually a way to re-use a board template (similar to what is discussed in #308). This doesn\u2019t change much in my review, just the fact that not copying archived lists as you originally did @floatinghotpot, was actually making sense.\nAlso I feel like the UX is not intuitive, because you first have to create a board and then go in the board menu to \u201cImport template\u201d (and if you already have some data in the board the UI will alert you that the board structure will be overwritten, \u201cThis action will overwrite current members, labels and lists.\u201d). I think this feature makes much more sense as an option in the creation form:\n\nI\u2019m not sure about the actual UI, I just modified the HTML in the browser tool to share the idea that the template should be defined on the board instantiation, not by overwriting any structure at a latter time.\nAlso I would really like this feature to be implemented as a plugin, maybe installed and activated by default, but the plugin work will rely on Meteor 1.3 that is currently not working with Wekan. Hopefully MDG will release a new beta this week so I can start writing a 0.1 version of the module system and API. If I can\u2019t get that minimal version implemented in any reasonable delay, then I will merge this feature without the ideal modularity and that will come later.\n. Which auto-install script did you use (there isn\u2019t any \u201cofficial\u201d script yet)?\nJust from reading the error, the following should work\n$ cd /root/bundle/programs/server/\n$ npm install\n[and restart the application]\n. What version of node and npm do you have installed node --version and npm --version?\n. Any idea @anselal?\n. That\u2019s a good idea, I will do that.\n. That\u2019s strange, I never experienced such a problem.\nTechnically speaking we don\u2019t use Ajax requests to communicate between the client and the server, but instead we rely on a stateful websocket connection. If this connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect regularly using an authentication token kept in the browser local storage (so there is no need to login again). And by the way, this isn\u2019t a protocol I designed, this is all standard from the Meteor platform.\nOne thing we definitely need to solve is reporting disconnection in the UI,  probably with a notification on top of the screen saying \u201cDisconnected, will try to reconnect in 8 seconds\u201d. That\u2019s should be pretty easy to implement, and would prevent users to lose changes.\nBut for the actual disconnection issue, I don\u2019t know what the problem is. It may be related to your deployment environment (for example, maybe websocket are not enabled, in which case the application fall back into HTTP long polling). Also, feel free to talk with me by email, I always like to know who is using Wekan in production :)\n. Let's talk about the disconnect indicator in #451, so I can close it when it gets resolved and keep this issue open until we figure out the connection problem.\nThe fact that the application works offline is by design, it's useful when you have latency between the client and the server and you don't want to wait 2 seconds after pressing Enter to see your card appear on the board.\nYou can contact me at mquandalle [at] wekan [dot] io.\n. Yes I would also like to support offline mode, in which case it is still relevant to have an indicator in the UI saying \u201cYou are in offline mode\u201d.\nI played with GroudDB and I\u2019m confident this is a good solution for us. However appcache is deprecated, and the replacing technology is the service worker. I would love to see someone developing an offline package for Meteor using service worker (and I\u2019m not the only one) and if no one is doing it, I may try.\nLet\u2019s open a separate thread about offline support and keep this one about the indicator. \n. Created #466 for offline mode discussions\n. @floatinghotpot is right, it\u2019s better to keep one issue per thread. Let\u2019s keep this one about \u201ctap twice to activate a click\u201d and use #448 for the issue with the login pages.\n. It sounds like a critical problem but I haven\u2019t reproduced it yet. @iwazaru are you using Sandstorm as well?\nTo help figuring out what is happening could you also share the browser version and take took in the browser console to see if there are some errors there?\n. @nhducit The above log is actually related to a \u00e0 priori benign edge case in Sandstorm, see https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/1318.\n. Doing the code review right now :)\n. This is a very important feature and I\u2019m glad you decided to tackle it. Aside from the usual small little improvements and bug fixes, I\u2019d like to rethink some of the internal APIs (including some of build-in) to make them more modular in preparation for the upcoming third party plugins. As this is a rather big topic I propose that we use Reviewable inline comments to define \u201csub-topic\u201d that I can then mark as \u201csolved\u201d even if the actual topic isn\u2019t attached to a particular line of code.\nAlso I will probably merge this feature even if all the APIs aren\u2019t perfectly modular since some discussions will involve more general refactoring that will be deffered. But the inline comments are still worth to address :)\n\nReviewed 21 of 21 files at r1.\nReview status: all files reviewed at latest revision, 17 unresolved discussions.\n\nclient/components/boards/boardHeader.jade, line 63 [r1] (raw file):\nI think a non board member should be able to get notifications as well (eg. on a public board).

I spend a fair amount of time playing with this UI on my mobile and I\u2019m impress that it works that well. So yes, that\u2019s some very good work here, and I want to get it merged.\nHowever there are also some design decisions involved in this new UI that requires some coordination, and probably some modifications in this PR. The biggest one is that I planned to remove the notion of list as a first class abstraction leaving only \u201cboards\u201d (or \u201cprojects\u201d) and cards (or \u201ctasks\u201d). I wanted to write a full rationale for that change but a big part of the motivation is explained in #211. This change would have some repercussions on the mobile and desktop, but I obviously can\u2019t blame you for not having anticipating this since I didn\u2019t really talk about it.\nAlso at this point I think we need to think of the UI globally which may also involves changing the desktop UI. For instance you putted the favorites boards header bar on the bottom of the screen on the mobile version, which makes sense if you consider only mobile but is inconsistent with the desktop version. So maybe one solution to this problem would be to create a left swapping menu on mobile that would display as a left sidebar on desktop and which would contain the user informations and the list of boards in a similar way with what Rocket.Chat is doing. Another example is the \u201cmaterial\u201d floating button to open the sidebar, I think it would make sense to have the same one on the desktop version.\nI will try to come with a proposition and some mockups here, and I propose that we agree on some UI design decisions that would work on both desktop and mobile so that we don\u2019t loose too much time changing the implementations details multiple time. Also if we end up changing a lot of UI elements (as you already have done in this PR), I would say that it is time to use React for new components as discussed in #299 (and now that the app build time has considerably decreased, yay!)\n. So I said that I needed to write done my thoughts about abstracting the notion of a list, here they are: https://discuss.wekan.io/t/abtract-lists-into-a-generalized-task-meta-data/121. I\u2019m curious of what you think about it @floatinghotpot.\n. I don\u2019t know if you had time to read the above @floatinghotpot, but I shared it because with this new potential model in mind having a list-selection page and then display only the cards of this list wouldn\u2019t make much sense. Being able to see cards instantly after clicking on a board (or \u201cproject\u201d) is actually the desired flow. Sure the navigation need to be improved on mobile, I actually like the \u201ctab system\u201d that you created in this PR, and I think it would makes sense to just arrive on the board view with this tab bar just below the board header.\n. @floatinghotpot and @nata-g I have copy pasted your comments on the list abstraction proposal back in the forum thread: https://discuss.wekan.io/t/abtract-lists-into-a-generalized-task-meta-data/121/6. \n. I think one solution is to provide an alternative way of moving cards/tasks that doesn\u2019t involve drag and drop. Trello has an option in their card menu to \u201cMove a card\u201d which provide a form where you can select a board, a list in this board, and a position in this list and press \u201cMove\u201d. Drag dropping cards is fun, but this more classical form would be useful for screen reader.\n. You don\u2019t really need to memorize the actual position since it is the default value of the <select> field. Basically once your browser focus on this field you can press \u2191 twice and press Enter to move the card up above the two previous ones.\nI haven\u2019t see Wordpress 4.4 DnD neither.\n. Yes with this solution all board selection, list selection, and position selection would be implemented using <select> fields (or maybe enhanced select-like HTML components, in which case we need to be careful about accessibility support).\n. As indicated in c69f9930137fc6f530ab92468041f06c2df69c63 commit message I decided to switch the stylus package for build performance reasons (on my computer along with the 2 others changes reloading the client now takes 3s instead of 15). I hope you alos experienced some better reload time while developing! I also indicated that the generated output is slightly different because we miss some of the generated prefixed properties (diff).\nI mostly use Firefox and Chrome and Android for browsing, and in these browser the reported issue doesn\u2019t appear. It seems that you are using Safari on iOs (my mother has an iPhone, I\u2019ll test the mobile view on it). So basically there are 2 different solutions:\n- Find a way to enable autoprefixing issues on the official stylus package (https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/5219) rather than switching back to mquandalle:stylus\n- Implement performant caching compiler on mquandalle:stylus and witch back to it\nI\u2019ll decide shortly on one of these, thanks for raising the issue :-)\n. Hum, so maybe I should check again on Android/Chrome because I may have confused the branches (while testing your mobile improvements that were relying on mquandalle:stylus) \n. Is this a duplicate of #457?\n. This changes some of the following behavior:\n- If the title contains only one line, the textarea is too big (should have the same size as the former input);\n- Pressing Enter should submit the form and edit the card, not create a new line.\n. Thank you very much @alayek, this will be in Wekan 0.11 :-)\n. What installation recipe did you follow?\n. Yes, that makes sense. When we will migrate to React, we\u2019ll probably want to refactor this duplicated code into a single small component, but it isn\u2019t worth the effort to do that on Blaze. Thank you for this!\n. Translations happen on Transifex, Italian translators can join the team here: https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/\n. Well, do what you want :)\n. What installation process did you follow? I suspect you are not running on the latest stable release.\n. Did you set the ROOT_URL environment variable when launching the Wekan Docker container?\n. You need to set the ROOT_URL to the publicly accessible url, the one that you are going to type in your browser.\n. It\u2019s weird, because at least on devel I\u2019m able to customize this absolute card URL by using the ROOT_URL env variable.\n. The link to MongoDB is done using the MONGO_URL environment variable. Did you set it?\n. Thank you for the detailed bug report. We should be able to figure out with that.\n. This was indeed fixed by #616, thank you again @AlexanderS.\n. This should be fixed.\n. Yes, you have to use node v0.10.40. You can use nvm to manage multiple version of node on the same machine.\n. To be clear, Wekan is a standard Meteor application, so the (sad) restriction of compatibility with the recent NodeJS is imputable to the platform. Currently Meteor support v0.10.40 and IIRC they plan to support v0.10.41 as it contains a security fix. As far as I know Wekan should run just fine on Node v0.10.41.\n(By the way the support of the Node 4.x.y will probably come when Meteor won\u2019t rely anymore on the native fibers module for running asynchronous code.)\n. Yes it\u2019s only a Meteor limitation, I wasn\u2019t able to find a clear ETA on Node update https://forums.meteor.com/t/nodejs-lts-support/14467\nMeanwhile nvm works perfectly fine.\n. Yes, this is the vertical counterpart of the horizontal #443.\n. Ah ok, thank you very much for clarifying. I\u2019ll see how I can debug that (generally speaking DOM mutating \u201csortable\u201d or \u201cdnd\u201d libraries are very difficult to tweak correctly).\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. You set the port to 6000 but I don\u2019t read it on the URL examples you provide. Is that on purpose? Shouldn\u2019t the ROOT_URL be http://example.com:6000/wekan? Otherwise if you want to use port 80 you don\u2019t have to set the PORT env variable.\n. We miss a \u201csign-in\u201d link on this page.\n. I guess you are speaking about moving boards in the home page grid? Could you explain more about what you are trying to achieve?\n. What do you mean by \u201cedit boards\u201d? It\u2019s already possible to change to board title (by clicking on it on the board view).\n. Where would you put the background? At the board level? On the home page?\n. @cenjoy Did you figure out. From your log output, the issue doesn\u2019t seem related to Wekan. Maybe it was just a connectivity issue?\n. This kind of question are better suited for the forum.\nMeteor doesn\u2019t really enforces a folder structure. The installation is documented in the wiki.\n. This kind of question are better suited for the forum.\nMeteor doesn\u2019t really enforces a folder structure. The installation is documented in the wiki.\n. This will be fixed by https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/pull/510\n. Yes, adding that interaction would makes sense.\n. How did you install Libreboard v0.6? Upgrade should be as simple as stopping the old version and starting the new version, data migration to the new format will happen automatically on the new version start.\n. Did you use the meteor command to start Wekan?\n. In this case the database is located under a local directory (.meteor/local) and so if you clone the new version in a separate directory you will start from a blank database. You should either copy paste the data from the old directory to the new one, or another solution is to git pull the new version directly from your original directory.\n. CLAassistant relies on GitHub identification, so the problem is actually that GitHub doesn\u2019t recognize your commit, and that\u2019s because for some reason (probably git misconfiguration) your commit doesn't include the author email address as you can see using git show 58f428.\n. Closing, as a different fix was merged in #430.\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you, I will review shortly and address your three questions\n. Wekan is dependent on node v0.10.40 due to Meteor limitations, let\u2019s use #634 to track the removal of that limitation.\n. Hi @ForNeVeR, sorry for the long delay before feedback. This looks good to me! Could you take a look at my inline comments and squash your commits into one so that I can merge?

I\u2019ve left some inline comments on specifics code issues that could easily be fixed and that would polish the feature behavior and its integration in the Wekan code base.\nAs a broader open question I wonder if we really need/want to introduce a checklistItem entity in the model, as its schema looks very similar to the card schema with small semantics changes (a card is \u201carchived\u201d whereas a checklistItem is \u201cfinished\u201d).

Thanks!\n. @xet7, as @ocdtrekkie pointed out, the CLA is by no way here to restrict user rights on the code, including the right to modify it. Wekan is released under the very liberal MIT license, which allows forks and even re-licensing.\nI wouldn\u2019t mind if there were a strong push for a community-governed fork, as the code could still go back and forth between the two \u201cbranches\u201d. However that would be a suboptimal model consuming both developers and confused users time, it would be better if people could be satisfied with the governance of this original Wekan repository.\nOne of the reason I failed to merge recent contributions, is because I focused on making a modular Wekan (basically what I have described here). A lot of different users want to write specific features and integrations, and a model where they can build and maintain these as plugins on top of a small core is appealing. I spent a lot of time trying to build that model, but I think I got lost in my will to rewrite everything. Especially when I tried to use cutting-edge tools (like GraphQL). Writing an open-source platform with a market store where people can publish and install plugins is much harder that I had hoped. And @ocdtrekkie is also right that I got burned doing solo development on Wekan for 18+ months, and at one point I stopped reading the notifications that came all days.\nMy long-term vision remains pretty clear: make Wekan an open platform for project management. I failed at my rewrite-everything solo plan. So I\u2019m going back to my code-review homework, and I\u2019ll try to associate other developers in the long-run.\n. Hi, it seams that you have made some progress in the fork. @xet7 would you be interested to get admin access on this wekan/wekan repository? Or should I delegate that role to someone else?. So @xet7 is now a Wekan admin, and he has already merged back the wefork/wekan repository and started to tackle issue triage. It's so great to have an active maintainer again, warm thank you @xet7.\nI wonder @xet7, are you using the Sandstorm integration or are you only self-hosting Wekan?\n@kentonv If I want to authorize a trusted third-party to release new versions of the Wekan spk, is the only way to transmit my app private key or is there now an option to have multiple authorized private keys?. @xet7 Sure, I've just done it. Sorry for not having thought of this before.. Yes, trusted builds are generated automatically, but there are some generals settings that might be changed at a latter point, so I'm sharing the access to DockerHub too. (Is your username xet7 on DockerHub?). @shuchuang, I will re-open if you could provide a description of the issue.\n. Yes, see also #323.\n. The eslint file was already modified and no longer includes Filter twice.\n. Thank you, that actually looks reasonable to me. The deffer-ed display has less to do with the actual animation than with Blaze slowdown on large list rendering, so having a timeout to say that the feed should be displayed after 100ms whatever happened isn\u2019t that bad.\n. Thanks for the hint to use Microsoft VMs, I was able to find the root cause of the bug, which is now fixed.\n. #650 is pretty critical as it prevent using Wekan from a blank database. I would recommend waiting for RC2 fix before testing. \n. Released RC2 with a few fixes.\n. Oh yes sorry, I encountered a weird bug while trying to publish RC{1,2} on DockerHub and didn\u2019t get back on it. I will try again now.\n. (Though I\u2019m not sure were these error messages comes from...)\n. So far I\u2019ve always moved the latest tag to the latest release, including release candidates. IIRC a similar pattern is followed by other open-source apps like Discourse, and maybe even recommended in the Docker documentation. It would makes sense to have an additional stable tag for people that want to stay on the stable release\u2014however there isn\u2019t any sort of automated updating or even notification when the tag you are following isn\u2019t up to date anymore, so the large majority of latest users won\u2019t notice the release candidate.\n. I haven\u2019t reseted my database before doing my pre-publish tests, and since we don\u2019t have automated tests I didn\u2019t catch this critical bug. Thank you for the report.\n. I\u2019ve just tested it and Heroku deployment is working. I think you started your deployment just before I released rc2.\n. @Abioy this is now fixed, see #650.\n. I had a hard time with implicit docker dependency and unexpectedly pushed a broken image as part of my deploy script. I\u2019m closing this issue as the image is now fixed on DockerHub.\n. The bug you encountered isn\u2019t actually related to docker, but to the lack of data migration to handle the language code renames. I\u2019ll write that before releasing the final v0.11. Thank you for the bug report. \n. Thank you!\n. Absolute URLs such as the above card URL are generated from the ROOT_URL environment variable. Adding the following parameter to the docker CLI launcher: -e ROOT_URL=http://<ipaddress>:8080\" should fix your issue.\n. Good catch @AlexanderS!\n. I think you should explicitly handle the case when currentUserId is null, and verifying that the user is a board member (Meteor.user().isBoardMember()) before executing the action\n. BTW in Trello this shortcut works when hovering a card in the board view. Since we currently don\u2019t have a good abstraction to implement that I won't ask you to do so, but could you please add a // XXX comment about it?\n. I generally use evt here. Could you change it just to be consistent with the rest of the code base? (and git commit --amend)\n. You don\u2019t need to fetch the entire board document here since only its _id is used \u2014 and Session.get('currentBoard') contains the current board identifier.\n. We should keep all the package version number in sync with the main app, ie 0.9.0.\n. Let's remove lines 4 to 10.\n. Maybe there could be a race condition here if the title is modified between the index capture and the substring (unlikely I admit). Any reason to not use\njs\ntitle = title.replace(`@${username}`, '');\nThat seems clearer to me.\n. I generally put a space after if\n. I believe that even if a blue label has a name we should still display it in the autocomplete list. If there are both an unnamed blue label, and a few blue labels with names with should display the unnamed label first and named label after that (in no particular order).\n. Could you add a // XXX comment to say that this code is duplicated from editor.js and that we should abstract this pattern to keep things DRY?\n. I\u2019m curious, why did add this file?\n. By the way I agree that this ESlint rule isn\u2019t right, I will probably remove it. Actually the following is perfectly valid in ES6:\nes6\nconst list = [];\nlist.push('abc');\nThe only thing that is prevented by the const usage is re-assigning the value of list, which would raise an error. But actual mutation is still possible... that\u2019s confusing to say the least.\nDon\u2019t modify this line, I just wanted to share my thoughts on it ;-) \n. Since 8bbc69616f91e9d09302d8a00f845b74e37d535f you can now rename textcomplete into escapeableTextComplete and remove all the duplicated code (ie the dropdownMenuIsOpened declaration, the EscapeActions registration and these $textarea.on hooks)\n. to remove?\n. I think it\u2019s worth implementing error handling here before merging the feature. Maybe we could use something like this?\n. currentLabel?\n. Sorry for that, I had disabled ESLint on my side :-(\n. Don\u2019t be sorry :-)\n. here\n. :+1: \n. I think the convention with Meteor is to throw a Meteor.Error\n. That\u2019s fine, I close my eyes :-)\n. Not important, but our eslint convention is submit(evt) {\n. What does \u201ccheck versus list\u201d means?\n. Hum I think Trello has one extra visibility option at the organization level.\n. They recently renamed the \u201corganization\u201d into \u201ctersonal team\u201d. This feature is in the free plan, you can create an organization with only one user in it (you) with the + icon on the header bar, and then select \u201cTeam visible\u201d in the visibility setting.\nI just tried and the permissionLevel is \"org\".\n. :zap: \n. Please remove trailing spaces (you should configure our editor to do so).\n. Is that an unrelated feature?\n. You should move http and ejson to the Utilities and epic to the UI components. Packages are sorted alphabetically \u2014 with official packages first.\n. We now use title.value.trim() instead of jquery utility function.\n. I think this doesn\u2019t work as intented because even if some tests fails the unix return code will be 0 instead of a greater number as it does with eslint ./ or even npm run lint. Could you verify @dferber90?\n. Commit dd10154 fixed it for me\n. Hum, I am pretty sure when I tested yesterday npm test; echo $? always gave me 0 even if there was some errors, but as I tested it again today I can\u2019t reproduce it, so I suppose I was doing something wrong... Anyway I prefer the output with the --silent option because I don\u2019t see the point of having 20 lines of npm ERR! to explain that is probably a problem with Wekan and not with NPM.\nAbout Meteor integration, IIRC one argument if favor of it is that it print lint warning in development server started by meteor run, so that\u2019s would definitely improve the contributor experience that won\u2019t have to write a lot of LOC before realizing they using different code styling conventions.\nAlso ESLint recently introduced a --fix option to automatically fix trivial formating issues. How could we use that tool if the command line eslint refer to the global version that misses some plugins instead of using the local one?\n. You should add the corresponding key in the i18n/en.i18n.json file (sorted by alphabetical order).\n. Same here, add the i18n key.\n. This should use ES6:\nes6\n  'click .js-add-attachment'(...args) {\n    Popup.open('cardAttachments').call(this, ...args);\n. I\u2019m a bit confused about this Popup.pasted, could you add a comment on it?\n. You should move this code in a dedicated file, also I would recommend to keep it unmodified. Adding\njs\n/*eslint-disable */\nat the beginning of the file should disabling Eslint for it.\nAlso, add a link to the source. \n. Please define a single variable per line (repeat const).\n. Could you explain the reason for this delay \u2014 and is there any chance we could remove it at some point?\n. We put a space after if, I\u2019ll see how to add that in the linting rules.\n. IIRC CollectionFS has a method to extract a file extension name.\n. Style: no space inside the parents\n. Could you add a comment about what this does \u2014 I guess, reset?\n. Style: don\u2019t align =\n. Could you try removing the setTimeout and executing Tracker.flush() before measuring the image to see if it works in the edge case you are mentioning?\n. I think $(document.body) is a more accepted convention, right?\n. Please remove the extra line\n. same\n. Style: no space between parents\n. Style: a space after if\n. You should use a local variable and not pollute the Popup object (which is too fragile and will cause bugs). Just create something let droppedImage; on top of this file, and use it here.\n. to remove\n. Hum, could you explain that? Should I merge it?\n. Since Session is a global store I totally like your namespacing convention, I will use it in the future \u2014 until eventually we have better build-in solution. :+1: \n. POJO? I\u2019m not familiar with this acronym, I would rather use \u201cJavaScript Object\u201d (or \u201cDictionary\u201d as in Python, but the \u201cJavaScript Object\u201d is clearer).\n. This submit function looks a bit complex to me, could you move the mapping logic in a separate method?\n. I will look at it, but I had some similar issues in the past. It\u2019s probably an issue with reactivity (ie the input is redrawn after the focus() call, or something like that).\n. Style note: I would write it either:\nes6\nif (!boardToCreate.members.find((wekanMember) => {\n  return (wekanMember.userId === wekanId);\n})) {\nor\nes6\nif (!boardToCreate.members.find((wekanMember) => wekanMember.userId === wekanId)) {\n. Could you just add a XXX comment saying that we should find a way to avoid this crazy DOM reading gymnastic at some point? (This is currently the easiest way to retreive the index so keep the code untouched, I would just like a reminder when we refactor client side state stores).\n. The security checks aren\u2019t actually implemented in these mutations methods but using the allow/deny rules (because it is possible to overpass mutations checks by simply executing the minimongo query on the browser console). I know that this is a bit confusing and I\u2019m considering an evolution of the whole mutation model (see also https://forums.meteor.com/t/new-package-mdg-method-meteor-methods-with-better-scoping-argument-checking-and-good-defaults/13833)\n. Could you write an abstract comment about how this importer work generally speaking?\n. Why do you concat? \n. I think using ES6 splash would be easier to understand:\nes6\nconst headers = ['title', 'description', 'status', 'owner', ...hMembers,\n                 ...hLabels, 'manHour', 'dueDate', 'startDate', 'finishDate', \n                 'createdAt', 'updatedAt'];\n. es6\n_.times(maxMembers - usernames.length, () => usernames.push(''));\n. es6\nreturn trelloMemberType === 'admin';\n. :+1: \n. Could hide the implementation details of the retrieval by creating the getLanguage() and getName() method on the user object (ie to the helper list defined in models/users)?\n. Doesn\u2019t this require the language code conversion that you implemented in #411?\n. Perfect!\n. I think it better to read it from Meteor.absoluteUrl.defaultOptions.rootUrl than from the process.env\n. I would use SimpleSchema.RegEx.Email (see https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema#regex)\n. Hey that\u2019s another feature! I won\u2019t ask you to put it in a separate commit because I understand it would be painful, but could you just mention it in the commit message in case (just in case we have some issue with it latter and we want to explore the history).\n. Since https://github.com/softwarerero/meteor-accounts-t9n/pull/129 was released, we can now remove this.\n. I would rather place this <select> in the registration form, no? (I can do it if you are ok with that)\n. No just the registration form.\n. Actually the reason why I would like the user to explicitly check the language before registration is because I plan to revive the \u201cWelcome Board\u201d feature. Basically it\u2019s a board filled with some data (like Wekan explanations) so that that the first page that the user see after registration is not a completely empty one and he can start playing with some data.\nThis board will need to be created (or rather copied from a template) just after the user has registered, and it will not be possible to change the language of the content (card titles, descriptions, comments) after its instantiation.\nAnd so yes, if we go on that path we should also add this field in the enroll by email form.\n. Actually I didn\u2019t try your implementation locally. I think the way you made it is elegant, so let\u2019s keep it like that. We may reconsider based on the rationale above when implementing #51.\n. I think it is better to rely on the device size than the user agent indeed. So you should remove the comment above.\nAlso we should use Meteor reactivity here! The window width may change (eg if a browser user change resize the window, or with the multi-app mode of new iOs devices). The way to support that is to register a tracker dependency like the one I created here and used here.\nActually since the dependency is actually the same as in the Popup example, you could move its declaration in the Utils and use it like Utils.windowWidthDep.depend();.\nFeel free to ask any question if something isn\u2019t clear :)\n. Instead of imperative addClass and removeClass I would expose the isMobile variable to Blaze templates (using Blaze.registerHelper) and use something like:\njade\n.pop-over(class=\"{{#if isMobile}}full{{/if}}\")\n. Same here: imperative vs declarative.\n. I never dared using calc because of browser support but that seem reasonable indeed http://caniuse.com/#search=calc. Cool!\n. Maybe we could have a mode with 3 items per row, between the 2 on mobile and 4 on desktop?\n. Why did you enlarge the quick-access bar even on desktop (with adding 20px of vertical padding)? I would recommend to keep it unchanged on desktop.\nAnyway I have some plan to transform this top bar into a left sidebar as does Rocket.chat for instance.\n. Always add a new line at the end of files.\n. same, new line.\n. As discussed in https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/396#issuecomment-164301574 I would favor a server-side export generation over a client one.\n. Soon we will have ES6 modules, yay!\n. I think the export format miss a formatVersion number that we can increment whenever we change the format.\n. Oh btw, I generally use the shorten form if margin-top == margin-bottom and margin-left == margin-right, ie:\nstyl\n  margin: 0 ($spaceBetweenTiles/2)\n. Where is this function actually used?\nAnyway, even if we need to rely on the user-agent somewhere (which is usually a bad idea) we should use a ismobile package instead of using a custom (and in this case, a bit simple) regular expression to test it.\n. I think you unexpectedly removed this title on the home page (or is there any reason?)\n. I don\u2019t really understand what you mean by this comment?\n. s/WeKan/Wekan/\n. :+1: \n. I would say, keep it on desktop and hide it on mobile if you want. This is the visual position where we put a title on all pages.\n. ah, ok.\n. Is there a need to repeat these 3 lines since there are already implied above by max-width: 800px\n. You could use the new Utils.windowResizeDep.changed() here and remove the windowResizeDep declaration.\n. Yes, sorry I didn\u2019t refresh the diff view (when I said that you didn\u2019t address my comment, I removed the message 1min after that when I realized that I was wrong)\n. Oh, you have actually done the change after my comment, that\u2019s why :-) \n. It\u2019s reasonable for now :)\n. :+1: \n. Maybe add the link to the https://blog.kayla.com.au/server-side-route-authentication-in-meteor/ article to explain to future readers what is happening here\n. IIRC, it\u2019s just historical chronology, we defined these methods before using collection-helpers.\n. Since you explicitly designed the export as the beginning point of a REST-like API, which is a good idea, I think it is worth considering the following point about the URI scheme:\n- I don\u2019t see the point of having to transmit both the loginToken and the userId, the former should be enough. This is how HTTP authentication usually work (either with a cookie on a web page, or with an explicit GET parameter on APIs) and I feel we should stick with this convention;\n- If we look at the Trello API only the \u201cmandatory method parameters\u201d are defined in the first part of URI, the rest is defined using GET parameters. This also assumes that we have a method name.\nWith these elements the URL would be:\njs\n`api/b/${boardId}/export?token=${loginToken}`\nWe might also want to follow Trello and use the explicit boards namespace instead of its b shortcut:\njs\n`api/boards/${boardId}/export?token=${loginToken}`\nI wonder if we should also explicit the return format in the URI using something like:\njs\n`api/boards/${boardId}/export.json?token=${loginToken}`\nI guess that would be useful if someone wants to implement some other serialization format at some point (XML lol). But this information could also fit elsewhere like in a GET parameter (&format=json) and since Trello doesn\u2019t use it we may as well follow them to facilitate plugin interpolation between Trello and Wekan.\nWhat do you think Xavier?\n. Another XXX TODO would be to share the route definition between the client and the server so that we could use something like ApiRoutes.path('boards/export', boardId) on the client instead of copy/pasting the route path manually from the server.\n. Ok with the 3 points :+1: \n. It seems to me that some complexity related to this component, and this function in particular, are due to the Popup environment restrictions. Aside from the from all the helpers to read and write the state, what is the simple data structure we need to use here?\n. We don't need this.\n. Use this.$ as it is more efficient\n. Point 2 is fixed. I think I should also tackle point 3 as we only need to reference the user id, not the whole document.\n. Point 3 is also fixed now\n. There is no https://indie.host/signup.png\n. Yes\n. For the record, I fixed this small syntax error before pushing this json file to Transifex.\n. ",

    "kadishmal": "Some ideas are using ElasticSearch as a backend, or embedded Lucene index, or just use MongoDB's MapReduce.\n. I would suggest designing a system that allows to write custom connectors. Think of it as a database connector for a CMS. They got very popular because they supported various backends. The idea is pretty much the same.\nI have learnt about Libreboard today from one of my colleagues who has recently installed Libreboard and in fact already forked and committed some new changes he wish Libreboard had. I hope he will contribute his changes here. The problem is that our have been using Asana for quite some time now, but the company policy prohibited to store internal data in the cloud. So, my colleague has found Libreboard.\nOne way we want to use Libreboard is by integrating it with our in-house repo manager like Github. Libreboard seems interesting for us as it's written in Node and we are Node developers. We can contribute and get started quickly.\nSo, I suppose there are many such cases when users would want to integrate Libreboard with some existing services like Github, Gitlab, etc.\nThe suggestion is to provide a foundation to write a plugin that will allow to perform simple operations like:\n- Linking issues to the external service for #number syntax.\n- Syncing comments, attachments and other activities to the external service.\n- Performing some post-actions like sending group or private message via a messenger app. For instance, we send alerts and other notifications to mobile users via our LINE messenger.\n- Importing new issues from external service back to Libreboard. This may resolve #113 as well.\nBasically, all these tasks can be accomplished as a post-action, i.e. by consuming a message queue. Imagine if Libreboard publishes a message for every action, there can be different consumers who would do some actions on interested events.\nThis would allow Libreboard users to write and connect external service at will.\nI can help to design #109, #128, #94, and overall architecture.\nI seem to have read most issues here, but haven't found a clear statement about the vision of the product. My vision for Libreboard would be to provide the most convenient UX to do Kanban standalone or on top of a number of existing services.\nSo considering this point of view I would disagree with @mquandalle and suggest that this functionality should go to the core of Libreboard and be the differentiating feature. Neither Trello nor Asana provide such integrations with popular VCS services.\n. @ocdtrekkie I don't think Libreboard should lock in in any vendor like Sandstorm. After all this is an open source project, not a project by Sandstorm and/or for Sandstorm. Users should be able to use it standalone.\nMoreover, many, if not all, enterprises would prefer not to add yet another software manager into their stack. For my company, we have enough expertise to figure out how to install most software. When enterprise chooses a specific tool, there is a precise reason why. In our case, the sole purpose is to provide a Kanban board with a relatively good UX (we believe in open source so we bet much that Libreboard will improve, so we can leave with what we have today) on top of our in-house git repo manager. So, we have already tested Libreboard and would love to contribute a generic connector/consumer that can be used to sync an external service with Libreboard. Did I tell you we are Node geeks?\nNevertheless, I don't mind if other tools like Sandstorm would exist and ease the installation of software like Libreboard. For many beginner users this would help a lot.\n. I may find some time to design the REST API. I have an extensive experience in designing and documenting an API.\nAs a start, since Libreboard is an open source tool, I would suggest maintaining the docs at https://apiary.io. Free for an open source project. At our company we can't use any external cloud services, so we use the API Blueprint syntax (a Markdown superset) and host it locally which is what Apiary.io is based on. They simply provide a hosted service for the docs with a test server.\n. DDP in my country means Digital Design Plaza. Did you it?\nRegarding swagger, I haven't seen it. If it's better, better to use swagger. Will check later and comment back. Apiary also generates code snippets for various languages and also provides a dummy API server to test you spec.\n\nOn Aug 5, 2015, at 7:57 AM, Jose notifications@github.com wrote:\n@kadishmal Do you think that would be better option than say swagger 2.0? From a swagger spec you can generate client/server boilerplates for many languages/frameworks... I think it'd be a better option. Check out the swagger editor, the examples and specially the export options.\nAs for DDP, it'd be better to have it just in the mobile clients. With Uri's angular-meteor and meteor-ionic, it's quite easy to get some code up & running in no time.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Have a look at how Asana can assign a single task to multiple projects and multiple sections.\n\n\nThe idea and requirements are these:\n- There are different people in the organization with different needs and views.\n- Some people need to know the overview of the things going on in the company, some need to know the details.\n- Say the CTO doesn't need to know which tasks go into your next release, however he needs to see your task/card that tells the story of you next release (you will have some just for him).\n- There are marketing guys who also don't care about implementation details, however they are interested in the parent/bigger tasks that their team and their next big launch depend on.\n- So different people may want to choose to organize the same set of tasks/cards in different ways.\nThe implementation that Asana team has provided is quite neat from the UX perspective and doesn't clutter the UI. In Asana terms, users can choose 0 or more projects/sections that a task can belong to. Inside those projects, the same task can be under completely different section in completely different order. For the marketing team your Feature X is the top priority, for security team this task is medium. Each team can rearrange the same task in their preferred way.\nImplementation wise it is relatively simple, too. In fact, the simpler you think, the easier will be to move on and make additional changes in the future. Here is how Asana team has implemented this feature.\nEach project (in Kanban terms this is a board) is a completely independent list. For now think of it as a linear array. Asana has visualized this list as a vertical list. Trelly and libreboard visualizes this same list horizontally. This doesn't matter.\nNow each such list (board) can contain 0 or more items (in Asana terms this is a section, in Libreboard terms this is a .... what? stage?) So, now we have an array of items each of which can be just a task/card or a card that can also contain a list of other items. This way, depending on the board, the same item can be placed at index [3, 2], meaning the 4th column/stage from the right and the second row from the top in this column.\nSince each item can be a card and also have a sub tasks/cards, this allow to create and link more granular tasks. These two features were one of the most frequently requested features in Asana when they had just opened.\nAnother advantage of such implementation is the speed of retrieval. When the client loads, the server can serve the top X items all of which are already ordered and prioritized. If a user wants to see more items or scrolls left to see left-hand columns, they get loaded in one go as they are already sorted.\nI suppose this implementation would satisfy #207 as well.\nAnother nice feature Asana provides is to duplicate a task and/or entire project with all their sections, tasks, and subtasks. This is what #134 wants. When implemented as a list of lists as described above, cloning is as simple as making a copy of the entire list. Order and priority will be preserved. The copy operation is essentially one database operation on a range.\n. :+1: I have the same issue when clicking on the \"Permissions\" menu item.\n. The suggestion is to group the trailing items into the last \"More\" menu. Would be also nice to have this list sorted based on frequency of usage or allow users to customize the order according to their wish.\n. ",

    "JamborJan": "Sorry to poke this half dead issue again, only a short question: when will the sandstorm app be updated?\n. Thanks :-)\n. If you want to use it on your own server try the sandstorm.io package of Libreboard. I'm using it only that way on my own server (along with other apps like draw.io). @mquandalle is maintaining the package so you can be sure to have the best version available.\nSee: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm\n. I'm not a designer thats why I posted my proposal not here. But I would suggest to focus also on tags, how they can be organized and nested. For me tags work best when I have a huge pile of information pieces in front of me and I need to organize it.\nhttps://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/98\n. From my point of view it would make sense for easy selecting tags to navigate through big amounts of cards (see: https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/98).\n. I'm running the sandstorm app. Is it possible that this view is not yet available there?\n. Cool cool, is the attachment feature also available then in the sandstorm app?\nThx.\n. I have thought a bit more about it and I think the following would be pretty cool. Again I'm not a designer so I did a quick mockup which should only show the function not a final UI design.\n- Of course there should be the sidebar where the tags could be the listed\n- The tags could be nested in multiple levels (2 levels only shown in examples below)\n- Multi selecting tags would filter the current view of cards accordingly\n- There should be e.g. tabs to create new views\n- A view is basically an amount of lanes where every lane can be assigned to one tag and only cards with that tag are shown\n- Moving one card from one lane to another would remove the tag where it was before and add the tag where it is dropped\n- All views can always be additionally filtered by selecting on or more tags in the side bar\nIssue: as this is very dynamically a manual ordering of cards in the lanes is not possible as far as I see. So there could be a sorting only by creation date, last update desc or asc.\nExamples\n\nHere you see the tag list on the left side, nothing is selected. On top you see 3 views which can be renamed. The lanes have each one tag, in the example the time tags.\n\nHere you see that one project tag is clicked in the left sidebar. The view is filtered and shows only cards with that project tag. \n\nThis example shows a view where name tags are building the lanes. Additionally the today tag on the sidebar is clicked so I see all tasks from all persons today. When I move one card from one lane to another the name tag  where it has been taken will be removed and the tag where it has been dropped will be added.\n\nThis example shows a view where project tags build the lanes. Furthermore there are two tags selected in the left sidebar. The view is filtered accordingly.\nI think this would be an awesome productivity feature and would make it easy to stay on top of a huge pile of tasks / cards. It would be also very flexible. You are working in development, no matter make a view with the upcoming sprints and move easy tasks from one to another. You are planning to build a new house? Make a view with the different companies involved. And so.\nFurthermore all other commercial products no matter what they are named can go f***k themselves.\n. Done, thanks for mentioning @ocdtrekkie.. Hey guys,\nThanks for the info and the great work. As far as I can plan I'll not be able to do any tests in the upcoming 2 months. Sorry.\nJJ. ",

Kanban is general process development tool made by Toyota, using physical table at wall with post-it notes. There are many different software that can be used for kanban.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)\nWekan does not have any UI or graphics from Trello because of original theme redesign at 2015:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#why-does-wekan-look-so-different-now-compared-to--v09\nWekan is original work. You can see git history with gui like gitk. Here is summary of Wekan 2 year history:\nhttps://blog.wekan.team/2017/12/2-years-of-wekan-what-we-archieved/index.html\nTrello is propietary code, it's not available anywhere publicly, only developers of Trello at Atlassian have access to Trello code. There was some Trello board where they listed what Open Source packages they use in Trello, but you can not clone Trello code repo, it's not public. Trello is only available as cloud service, you can not download Trello server, like you can download Wekan server in Docker, Ubuntu snap etc.. Wekan currently has:\n- Swimlanes\nAnd upcoming is:\n- Children/Nested tasks https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1723\n- Linked Boards and Linked Cards https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1592. Use markdown on card description.. Fixed already.. See logging features at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features. @DanielRuf \nI'm waiting reply from potential customer could they sponsor this feature.. There is no sponsors or bounties for this feature, I did not get any reply from customer.\nThere is GitLab interview at FLOSS Weekly, and from that I got info that not all features are in Open Source version. For example, when I tried to enable syncing latest Wekan changes from GitHub to GitLab.com, there was text that it is paid only / Enterprise feature. There seems to be some translation support in GitLab, but no Finnish translation yet.\nThere is already Wekan-Gogs integration:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs\nI have translated Gogs to Finnish previously, and Gogs is available for Standalone and Sandstorm, where it's getting final fixes, then newest Gogs changes will be available at Sandstorm.\nSo currently it looks like I'm concentrating to Gogs.. @mouradghafiri \nI can't use patreon, because it works like donations. Receiving donations is not allowed by law in Finland, it would require a lot of paperwork. There is no need to add patreon.\nIt is already possible to add bounties to this issue, info about how it works at BountySource is at https://wekan.team . This is a working way that is allowed by law at Finland. Many backers can participate to funding this feature. Direct link to bounty page of this GitLab feature.\nBenefit of using bounties is also that when amount of bounty rises to over $300, usually then there appears some interested developer that starts to implement it. This has happened many times, and that way also I don't need to implement everything, there are many developers and companies that are already implementing features for Wekan, as can be seen from Roadmap.. Today there has been these news:\n- GitLab 10.6 released with CI/CD for GitHub and deeper Kubernetes integration\n- related Hacker News article\nSo, I tried at GitLab.com, and I was able to add automatic syncing repos from GitHub to GitLab.com . I don't know are those features included in Open Source version of GitLab, but at least having mirroring working changes status from impossible to possible.. Hmm, I'm not sure do I understand these all correctly:\n- External CI/CD configuration in Starter and Bronze \"Note that as part of our commitment to open source, public projects on Free GitLab.com have features equivalent to a Gold level subscription. So those public projects will continue to have this feature.\" so if I setup CI/CD at GitLab.com for Wekan Open Source project, I presume it stays working, and I can look at all features at Gold level that should work now at GitLab.com\n- Navigate to external issue tracker, could this be used to replace GitLab issues/board with Wekan board\n- SAST security report on pipelines view This would be nice, previously I have already security reports from quay.io. @gramakri \nThanks, pull request very welcome wehen you find more time! :)\nPull requests are much easier for me to test than to figure out what has changed in outside repos.. @gramakri \nPull request can be done to Wekan devel branch.. I did some cleanup on this issue, to make it easier to implement in future.. @bbenoist \nWhy are you spamming issues? Why the downvotes? Wekan team is doing it's best to add new features. If we get a lot of spam, it really slows down development.. @bbenoist \nYou can contribute by adding any relevant information needed to implement this, if something is missing. That will make this feature implemented sooner.\nWekan has frequently new releases and new features added.\nIn cleanup, I did keep all comments that had newest information and links that make implementation work possible. That will make it easier when I or somebody else starts implementing this.. Thanks @soohwa :). @bbenoist \nI do make mistakes, understand wrong, don't always get answers right at first time, make typos etc. That's typical to humans. At some point I \"get it\" and make corrections accordingly. :). @klinger \nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ. # Specs for developing LDAP feature for Standalone Wekan\nOther LDAP integrations with source code available\n\nStandalone Wekan at Cloudron https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/119#issuecomment-287597821\nSandstorm https://sandstorm.io\nMeteor.js https://guide.meteor.com/accounts.html and https://atmospherejs.com/?q=LDAP\n(Owncloud also had LDAP, maybe look some inspiration there for example look and feel, although not required).\n\nRequirements\n\n\nAll LDAP settings done with environment variables like at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml . Wekan does not use plugins, all is in same codebase and features turned on and of with environment variables. No passwords should be visible as plain text in Standalone Wekan Admin Panel, so in near future email settings password will be removed from Admin Panel, so they are not visible to other admins. In general, all settings need to be able to be set using environment variables.\n\n\nIn added LDAP code, check that Standalone LDAP is not enabled when running at Sandstorm. You can check it using for example with code if isSandstorm... as can be seen at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/sandstorm.js\n\n\nIn LDAP environment variable settings, have setting what LDAP field(s) to use for authentication, what human readable name to show in Admin Panel, and have those in some format like for example: \"Employee Number:LDAP_employeeid\", \"Email address:LDAP_email\", etc, so it can be defined what fields are visible and editable at Admin Panel / People, for example these: Employee Number, First Name, Last Name, Email, date of creation, date of last connection. Those dates of creation and last connection need to saved.\n\n\nIn Standalone Wekan Admin Panel / People, Administrators of Wekan application should be able to create also local accounts, that are not using LDAP. Local accounts fields also should be defined in environment variables, like at previous requirement 3.\n\n\nImporting and exporting LDAP and local accounts users from csv file.\n\n\nIn Wekan Admin Panel, Administrators should be able to manage users : search, disable or enable users, edit user details.\n\n\nImmediate syncronization between Wekan and LDAP, in a way that causes least amount of required data transfer and delays, when there is thousands of users. For example, keeps most LDAP data at LDAP, and only have user ID saved and used in Wekan MongoDB. Look at previous LDAP implementations about what would be more most efficient way.\n\n\nFor MongoDB database schema changes, add migrations to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/migrations.js\n\n\nRequirements for Wekan scalabilitity to thousands of users\n\n\nAdd Redis Oplog support, see https://github.com/cult-of-coders/redis-oplog and https://forums.meteor.com/t/meteor-scaling-redis-oplog-status-prod-ready/30855/479\n\n\nIf there is other ideas to improve scalability, add info to existing issue https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/issues/2 , there is also mentioned that smart-disconnect is already in Wekan.\n\n\nAbout Wekan Development in General\n\n\nDeveloper Documentations about code style, linting etc https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Developer-Documentation and https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Directory-Structure\n\n\nMention URL to your fork of Wekan repo so xet7 can fetch from that upstream, test your changes and add them directly to Wekan. Also do merge changes in Wekan devel branch often to your fork this way:\n\n\n1) Fork Wekan repo\n2) Clone your fork\n3) Get Wekan changes\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/wekan/wekan.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/devel\ngit push\n4) Alternatively:\na) Get latest VirtualBox image from https://wekan.xet7.org and compile there\nb) Use Ubuntu 14.04 64bit or newer for example 17.10, or on Windows platform Ubuntu for Windows, and compile from source with below build script.\n5) Newest source build scripts are at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/tree/master/virtualbox , so there rebuild-wekan-meteor-1.6.sh when run with first time with \"1) install\" and then second time \"3) rebuild wekan only\" will build Wekan. After that you can use node-allow-port-80.sh to allow node to use port 80 and start-wekan.sh and stop-wekan.sh for start and stop.\n6) Another way to build Wekan from source is with Docker, because newest Dockerfile contains all current versions that Wekan uses to build Docker image. Install Docker and Docker Compose from www.docker.com . Docker Compose is separate install on Linux, but is included in Docker for Mac and Windows.\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan.git\ncd wekan\n```\nMaybe make source code changes here and changes to docker-compose.yml like ROOT_URL=http://your-ip-address:port like documented at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml\nBuild Wekan on Debian 10 container from source, and use existing MongoDB Docker image:\ndocker-compose up -d --build\n7) As you can see from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile Wekan currently uses Meteor 1.6.0.1 and it's related versions of Node.js 8.9.3 and NPM 5.5.1. For those Meteor documentation is at https://docs.meteor.com/v1.6/ . Currently Meteor bugs are preventing upgrading Meteor to v1.6.1 https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9609 but when those are solved, I can  upgrade. \n8) For looking at how various previous Wekan features have been implemented, you can look at Wekan git repo history with viewer like gitk, or search from closed pull requests at https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed. If someone has suggestions, improvements etc to above specs, please add comment to this issue.. @corecache \nPlease try to add RocketChat LDAP to Wekan, it would be awesome \ud83d\udc4d . Please, anyone working on this feature, please add info of your progress. For example:\n- @corecache seems to be working on this\n- @RafaelSilva maybe too at https://discourse.wekan.io/t/working-in-the-ldap-feature/661\n- some company asked me to develop LDAP feature, I have not started this\n- one company already has LDAP, SAML and Teams/Groups feature that they are looking is it possible to contribute those somehow, it's not known yet\nSo it seems that at least 2 companies (Cloudron and above) already have LDAP in Standalone Wekan, but it's not yet at this Wekan upstream. I don't know how many other features are implemented in custom forks of Wekan.. Also needs to work with https://www.openldap.org. Some UCS OpenLDAP documentation here:\nhttp://docs.software-univention.de/domain-4.2.html#ext-dom-ubuntu. @nebulade has not reported any progress yet.\nGenerally it varies how much time each contributor has available. I do anyway plan to fix all bugs and implement all features in long term, so if there is no progress on some issue, I start working on it sometime.. @nebulade \nThanks for reply !\nYes, currently also oauth2 login pull request is done with replacing accounts-password package. I have heard similar from someone that used SAML.\nI will look about these various login options and see what would be best way to make them work at the same time, in integrated way.. @corecache \nThanks!\nFor LDAP settings, preferred way would be to use environment variables as described on requirements comment above.\nRecommended next steps:\n1) One Auth method enabled\n\nThere is also oauth2 pull request\nLike there is isSandstorm variable currently, there could be for example isLDAP, isPASSWORD, isOAUTH2 as boolean\nAll settings as environment variables preferred\nOnly one authentication method enabled, no Admin Panel UI managing users of that authentication method\n\n2) Multiple Auth methods enabled\n\nuser management for each authentication method in Standalone Wekan Admin Panel\n\n3) Additional management features in Admin Panel\n\nOther features.. @corecache \n\nCan you provide example values to above and info what is optional?. Also anyone else that is following this issue, and is familiar with LDAP, could provide info.\nPreviously I did maintain LDAP some years ago, and I did not do much configuring, so when I'm testing this, I'll need to setup LDAP server etc, and read more about usage.. My current plan is to just expose those settings as environment variables that can be set, like these previous:\nSnap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nDocker:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml\nSource:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/start-wekan.sh. I have not yet looked how RocketChat makes all those authentication methods configurable. It would be useful to bring all those to Wekan somehow.. Another way would be to use Rocket.Chat for all authentication, and also login to Wekan with the same auth. If that is possible.. Currently I'm looking here:\nhttps://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/iframe-integration/authentication/\nhttps://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/iframe-integration/\nSome related unanswered question is at forum:\nhttps://forums.rocket.chat/t/user-logged-out-of-server-rest-api-iframe-commands/1631\nMaybe some authentication token could be used to also login to Wekan at the same time.\nWekan API currently is for admin permissions only:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API\nIf someone has more info about this, it would be helpful.. @maximest-pierre \nHow does it work, step by step? Did you test it? Where are settings configured?\nI think that to get this all working, following are required:\n- LDAP code from corecache\nFor configuring with environment variables:\n- Changes to latest Dockerfile\n- Changes to snap settings using and examples by Akuket\n- Changes to source install settings\nOr for configuring in Admin Panel:\n- Adding to Admin Panel Settings and Settings MongoDB model\nAnd these would need to be combined to pull request, that would make it possible, that if LDAP is enabled and settings set, LDAP would work.. @maximest-pierre \nWould it be possible that your meteor package be hosted at Wekan GitHub org? Because that way I would be able to make fixes directly to it. I would create new repo to https://github.com/wekan/ldap (or any other repo name) and invite you with commit access.. @maximest-pierre \nI sent you invite to https://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap. @Saruspete \nReport to wekan-ldap .. @Saruspete  \nI added newest Wekan release to latest tag.\nI will try adding LDAP to Wekan according to your script at your comment above.. It seems that I do not yet have time to make changes.\nI added https://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap/issues/3 about what is required before integrating LDAP to Wekan.. @Akuket has been doing additions to LDAP code of @maximest-pierre .\nFrom @Akuket \nNow, i must manage some use cases. Tell me what you think about them :\nTo manage the connection, I connected to the event 'submit form' of the Template userFormsLayout in the file layouts.js. Inside it :\n1 I must check the authentication method allowed for the user :\n-> case 1 : The user is in database and can/must login with the LDAP\n-> case 2 : The user is in database and can't login with the LDAP\n-> case 3 : The user isn't in database (The ldap must be enabled to create and then to connect the user)\n2 I must select the authentication method :\nIF LDAP :\n-> case 1 : The LDAP is enabled\n-> case 2 : Not\nELIF DEFAULT :\npass\nELSE (for future authentication methods as needed)\npass\nIn callback after try to connect by the LDAP :\nCan connect -> perfect\nException caught :\n-> case 1 : The user isn't in the LDAP\n-> case 2 : The user is in the LDAP but the param ldap in database isn't true (normaly impossible thanks to the verification above)\n-> case 3 : The user is in the LDAP but has provided bad credentials\nIF EXCEPTION AND LOGIN_FALLBACK (env var) IS TRUE\nWhat cases above I allow to try to connect by the default method ?\nFrom @xet7 \nIf password login is disabled, and LDAP is enabled, requirement for logging in with LDAP is that LDAP user must belong to specific LDAP group that is allowed to use Wekan. In that case, Wekan should get details from LDAP, and create new Wekan user, and log user in.\nIf login to Wekan is allowed to all LDAP users, and not limited to specific LDAP group, then all LDAP users can login, and Wekan user will be created for them, when they login. \nFrom @Akuket \nI have modificated the user model to add a boolean param named ldap. The person who made the code, use it in this code. Instead of that, one could imagine a connection variable that would contain the default authentication method of the user and that would be configurable from the admin panel \nIn that way, we can seperate local accounts and ldap accounts or others.\nFrom @xet7 to all:\nThere is currently in progress adding multiple auth methods. There is existing password auth, LDAP (this issue), OAuth2, Auth0 and CAS. Friend auth is not started yet.\nFor identity providers, there are alternatives like:\n- https://www.keycloak.org that is Open Source, made with Java, has Docker image\n- https://auth0.com\n- Rocket.Chat, that can be OAuth2 provider for Wekan\nLogin experience?\nHow should the login experience be?\nSingle Login\nIn single login, it would be best to get id provider logging to all apps at once. Currently there is 2 login steps:\n- id provider login => wekan/rocket.chat/etc login button => now logged in to one app.\nIt should be:\n- id provider login => logged in to all apps.\nMultiple auth enabled\nIf there are multiple authentication methods enabled in wekan, like for example password / OAuth2 / LDAP, then maybe there would be\n- username and password field\n- selection options what login method to use, for example:\n```\nUsername or Email Address: [_ ]\nPassword: [_]\n(X) Password\n() LDAP\n() OAuth2\n(_) CAS\n[Login]\n```\nWhen new user would be created?\nWhen self-registration is turned off:\n- LDAP/OAuth2/CAS: If there is existing user with that username and password in LDAP/OAuth2/CAS\n- Password: If there is existing user in Wekan that has been created with Wekan REST API (or at Wekan Admin Panel, maybe at future)\nAnd also limiting OAuth2 and others to one domain https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1904\nOriginal Requirements\nI added some comments.\n\n\nAll LDAP settings done with environment variables like at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml . Wekan does not use plugins, all is in same codebase and features turned on and of with environment variables. No passwords should be visible as plain text in Standalone Wekan Admin Panel, so in near future email settings password will be removed from Admin Panel, so they are not visible to other admins. In general, all settings need to be able to be set using environment variables.\n\n\nIn added LDAP code, check that Standalone LDAP is not enabled when running at Sandstorm. You can check it using for example with code if isSandstorm... as can be seen at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/sandstorm.js\n\n\nIn LDAP environment variable settings, have setting what LDAP field(s) to use for authentication, what human readable name to show in Admin Panel, and have those in some format like for example: \"Employee Number:LDAP_employeeid\", \"Email address:LDAP_email\", etc, so it can be defined what fields are visible and editable at Admin Panel / People, for example these: Employee Number, First Name, Last Name, Email, date of creation, date of last connection. Those dates of creation and last connection need to saved. There is limiting Wekan users to one LDAP group, is it enough? Not all these fields exists yet in Wekan.\n\n\nIn Standalone Wekan Admin Panel / People, Administrators of Wekan application should be able to create also local accounts, that are not using LDAP. Local accounts fields also should be defined in environment variables, like at previous requirement 3. It needs checking is defining local accounts fields implemented yet.\n\n\nImporting and exporting LDAP and local accounts users from csv file. Not started yet I think.\n\n\nIn Wekan Admin Panel, Administrators should be able to manage users : search, disable or enable users, edit user details. Only edit user details is currently available. Does LDAP has some field who is admin?\n\n\nImmediate syncronization between Wekan and LDAP, in a way that causes least amount of required data transfer and delays, when there is thousands of users. For example, keeps most LDAP data at LDAP, and only have user ID saved and used in Wekan MongoDB. Look at previous LDAP implementations about what would be more most efficient way. There is idea that all user data would be in LDAP, like username/password/avatar/permissions admin,normal,no comments,comment only. Is this possible, or does data need to be saved in Wekan? Also in other auth methods, does that data need to be stored in Wekan MongoDB at all?\n\n\nFor MongoDB database schema changes, add migrations to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/migrations.js\n\n\nComments please\nEveryone, please add comments if there is some use case I did not include yet. You can also help with current issues implementing this with helpful comments, pull requests etc.. Wekan v1.53.2 snap+docker included latest IFTTT+LDAP, please test what works, but make sure you have backups. This is very experimental, brand new, and can contain bugs, or not work at all.\nPackage\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap\nDocker\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/Dockerfile\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/docker-compose.yml\nSnap\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/snap-src/bin/config\nOops LDAP help missing from snap, should be added later.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/snap-src/bin/wekan-help. Someone, please:\n1) Add comment to this issue that you are helping with LDAP with these a) or b) or both\na) Add Wekan snap help LDAP options as pull request to this file, you see file format at this file:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/snap-src/bin/wekan-help\nAll LDAP options can be seen from links in above comment.\nb) Add LDAP options to this snap wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nThanks!. Thanks @Akuket , added to Wekan.\nSomeone could add this remaining one:\nb) Add LDAP options to this snap wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys. @maximest-pierre \nLDAP is at Wekan Edge Docker:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/docker-compose.yml\nSnap is still broken, because I could not get MongoDB working correctly. I will add info to Edge ChangeLog when it works.. LDAP login works now by using this docker-compose.yml file:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/wekan/wekan/edge/docker-compose.yml\n- adding ROOT_URL, LDAP settings etc to that file.\nUsing this docker-compose:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/compose/install/\nWith this command:\ndocker-compose up -d --no-build\nBounty participants: Please check your email and accept bounty payment.. Wiki page for LDAP: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/LDAP. @Vnimos \nscope is now fixed in newest Wekan.. moved to #109 . @m0nhawk \nThis issue is already closed, please continue at open issues, that are:\n- Switch to React #299 \n- Creating React native mobile apps #480\nSomebody at Wekan chat channel said about looking at switching to React. More developers and pull requests welcome.. Moved to #166. Wekan already has checklists.\nClosing issue.. Moved to #796. Pull request https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/446 will be merged later.\nClosing issue.. I will add S3, Google Drive support etc. I'll add this to my todo list.. Planning to use this package https://atmospherejs.com/malibun23/files\n. @wongalvis @jLouzado \nThere is already:\n- labels for cards\n- starring for boards\nThis should be enough. If not, add new issue with more details.. Moved to #790. PR https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/446 will be merged later.. Installation documentation has already been added.\nClosing issue.. @martinhbramwell @mquandalle \nHow about using DreamFactory platform for APIs ?\nhttps://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/391\nhttps://www.dreamfactory.com\n. @AlexanderS \nProbably adding DreamFactory platform support would be similar to adding Sandstorm support. All authentication, database handling or moving to other database, etc is handled by DreamFactory, that creates REST API's that Wekan would call. There is no need to touch DreamFactory code etc, just use it's admin UI, and have Wekan as frontend calling REST APIs.\nDoes this differ how current plans is with REST API ?\nIs there difference is REST API backend provided by NodeJS or PHP ?\n. @martinhbramwell @Xaptor @ForNeVeR \nPlease see:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/FAQ\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md\nAnd create new issue about REST API to discuss more:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues. @tugal\nPlease continue discussion about API at Wefork:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/43\nOriginal Wekan has not received updates for 4 months.. Wefork has been merged to Wekan and is under active development.\nDiscussion moved back to here.\nSummary\nAsked on original Wekan Gitter by @RaviRokkam_twitter\nRaviRokkam wanted to integrate website with Wekan, so if task is added to website, it should be added as a card to Wekan.\nThis would require API to access Wekan data.\nThere is related Python-based project, but it seems to have read-only access, so adding a card is not included:\nhttps://github.com/LINKIWI/wekan-api. @huneau \nPlease work on pull requests on wekan meteor-1.4 branch where it's easier to test.. Already merged. For additional features to API, moved to #1037. Moved to #802. Moved to here from #1721 \nMaybe Docker would work for OpenShift?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nOr some other platform?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nOpenShift is part of not tested platforms. If you get it running, please add new wiki page, and link to it:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms#not-tested-yet. Deployment yml to OpenShift here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/openshift. Wekan already has Link to this card feature.. Moved from #886 \nFrom @simonsmiley \nSlug in board url isn't used\nThe slug in the board url b/:id/:slug isn't actually used anywhere. As far as I can tell it's just saved in the database and never used, so why is it there in the first place. It's mildly confusing that the slug in the url can be changed and you still get to the right board. However removing the slug from the url does result in an error.... @brooksbecton \nYes swipebox would be very nice, please go ahead \ud83d\udc4d \nI will add this to Roadmap,. Ok I updated Roadmap. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. Don't add comment with +1, use thumbsup reaction.. Moved to #552 . @sonicviz @ePirat \n@entrptaher today added new Windows instructions, you can try does it work for you:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-from-source-on-Windows. LDAP moved to #119. OAuth2 at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1578\n. Moved to #797. Please use Docker version or precompiled tar.gz version.\nClosing issue.. @yipcma \nAre there some in existing stats features that already contains same as analytics of atmospherejs ?. @rjevnikar \nThere could be buttons at top bar for:\n- My Boards\n- Public Boards\n- Subtask Boards. @TiibCD \nWell, maybe it could be like:\nBoards: Starred [_] | My [X] |  Subtask Master [_] / Child [_] | Public [_]\nThere is also related Top Level Boards issue for other way to categorize.\nAdmin Panel could also have options like:\n- [] Disable Public Boards\n- [] Disable Subtasks\n- [] Disable Custom Fields\n- [] Show list of Public Boards to all users. (Default is show only to Admin)\nWhat do you all think?. @GavinLilly\nI presume you have a lot of boards. What kind of categorization would work best for you?. @DrGraypFroot \nWhat kind of categorization would work best for you? Having Subtask Master / Child boards on separate views would help already I think.. @GavinLilly \nThat many boards makes me think of pagination, maybe with selectable amount of boards per page.. @andresmanelli has Gogs integration is in progress, part 1 is already merged.. @andresmanelli some ideas for Wekan with Gogs:\nhttps://blog.bitbucket.org/2017/09/13/say-trello-to-boards-in-bitbucket/. @andresmanelli \nDoes the integration CLI NodeJS app do anything other than call Wekan and Gogs APIs ?\nCould the same be done with Huginn #1160 that has Web UI for adding workflows with API integrations? It that issue the plan currently is to have Docker compose script similar to these, just include Huginn Docker container:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-postgresql\nSame idea is in Rocket.Chat integration https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/672#issuecomment-328469079. @andresmanelli \nIf integration is done with Huginn, it would be easier to customize list names etc at Huginn web interface. There would be no need to touch CLI NodeJS app code that would be running in some container.. This needs testing, please add issues, pull requests etc to this separate project:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs\nThanks to @andresmanelli  !. Moved to #802. This is already fixed. Now we have a message in the details page saying the card is archived.. It does not seem to be so good idea to switch to react anymore because of this:\nhttps://react-etc.net/entry/apache-foundation-bans-use-of-facebook-bsd-patents-licensed-libraries-like-react-js. Moved to #953. Reopening, will see later if there is progress on this.. @jcrben\nNo. That would just add more bloat.\nI would prefer pull request to to Wekan that would change used libraries to ones that have smaller amount of javascript used. Also, preferedded license to used libraries is MIT.. @jcrben \nReact is bloated. Something like RE:DOM or Mithril would be much better.. Anyway, for first time contributor, first task is to get to know Meteor, and do some contributions to Wekan. Not to change Wekan to other framework.. @danieldownes \nHuh, really, where you got idea that thumbs down is encouragement to implement feature?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#etiquette. Hehe :) Wekan is friendly positive community, not Linux kernel mailing list.. Actually we do have some priorities, I updated Etiquette.\nWekan has quite small codebase of about 7000 lines only when not conting node modules, so contributing is easier than to some other huge projects.. I found that here on old PR: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/397\ncould be these upload drag-and-drop and clipboard paste code: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/397/commits/955fabf4ba381d47c0096018ba7df5e29a29cc5f and  https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/397/commits/4a3525ba0d2f3f9a039cd6485cbc8dfafbf0d10f\nActually paste from clipboard should already be at Wekan: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/387\nIt needs testing that does it work, and creating a new pull request.. Drag and drop attachment already exists in Wekan.\n. Moved to #802. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/446 will be merged later.. Moved to #926. There is related feature of comment-only permissions on boards, but that is only for logged in users.\nVote on cards is separate issue at #796. Moved to #1124. Moved to #641. We are not going to do NPM-based plugin system because of issues mentioned at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/781. Try newest Wekan.\nClosing issue.. 1. Yes, that's how it works currently.\n2. Themes #781 will make all layout customizable at some point.\n3. See 2. above\n4. Viewing attachement seems to work now.. @ndarilek \nDoes https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1042 fix this issue for you? Or is there still something to fix?. Moved to #794. This is already implemented in Admin Panel settings to set Wekan invite-only.. Moved to #109. Use Docker version or VirtualBox appliance, see this repo readme and wiki.\nInstalling from source does not work on Windows.. Moved to #973. Moved to #797. Wekan already has this.. Please try with newest version. If this happens again, reopen this issue.. This pull request has been made a long time ago, it would need some work to add all the new tables, columns etc from MongoDB database, so that this would Import/Export would  correctly. Contributions welcome.. Also see wiki page: Excel and VBA. @anikasingh201611 \nThis is not available, because nobody has cleaned up this or added latest database fields to export/import or submitted fixed PR. Issue for this is #395 . This is already merged to Wekan.. Try Nginx examples at wiki.. Moved to #808. @AlexanderZobkov \nThis issue is open, as you see at top of this webpage in green. Above closed issue 1168 mentions this issue.. Card color, todo:\n\n. @Bertrandcoic \nThis issue is still open, so this feature is not in Wekan yet. Also, in previous comment I said \"todo\" and there is mockup. It is not in Wekan yet.. Moved to #781. @savolai \nIt's not yet on Sandstorm, see #799. @GhassenRjab\nDo you have time to look at this Wekan board import?\nThere is related already merged pull request about Trello import\nAnd some existing CSV/TSV import/export pull request.. @GhassenRjab \nYes continue with this approach. Thanks!. @victort \nThis is old issue. Add new issue.. Invitations do work already.. Related #979 and #797. @GregBusch1995 \nThis old PR is not related to current Template issue #2165 that is not merged yet. Template issue will be added to stable release when it works.. @GregBusch1995 \nWekan v2.29 is now released, it includes current Templates feature that is in progress. If you find some new bugs, please add comment to #2165. Use newest version, install instructions at repo readme and wiki.. @sinasalek \n1) Don't comment on closed issues. If you don't find existing open issue, create new issue.\n2) Nobody has had success with compiling from source on Windows. If you get it working, please add your instructions to existing wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-from-source-on-Windows\n3) If you want to use Wekan on Windows, you could ty it with Docker.. @sinasalek \n@entrptaher today added new Windows instructions, you can try does it work for you:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-from-source-on-Windows. @abdulquadir202 \nThis issue is closed, please continue discussion at #883. Reconnecting works with refresh at least, and logout seems to work currently.. Moved to #953. @tobleron \nIt's labels.styl:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/client/components/cards/labels.styl\nIn Wekan installations, built javascript could have different directory structure.. Latest Wekan v1.03 has more label colors.. @smerschjohann\nImproving mobile web is at Roadmap.. Merged after conflict resolution at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1365 . Thanks a lot @floatinghotpot !. @lichtamberg \nYour issue moved to #953. There is already checking for if user already exists.. Related bug of loss of entered text #558 , moved to here.. @miherlosev \nThere is .travis.yml file and build passing badge already at:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan\nIf it's missing something, send a pull request or add issue to wefork what I should add there.\n. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1592. @vrms \nYou need to setup correct root url also in snap, and use your computer's IP address or URL, not localhost:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys. This issue is very old. AFAIK wekan export of board etc works currently when ROOT_URL is setup correctly.\nFor Wekan snap related issues, please add new issues to here instead:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues\nClosing issue.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. @AlexanderZobkov \nNo, don't create new issue. I did change issue name to have both rows and columns mentioned.. @dpoznyak \nIf you find good fix, please add pull request to Wekan devel branch. Thanks!. @c25\nWhat is the problem? Example Apache config is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Apache\nAnd sub urls work with Nginx and Caddy already. This is very old issue.\nGenerally you proxy from https://example.com/wekan to localhost port like 3000, and setup Wekan ROOT_URL to htts://example.com/wekan and PORT=3000 .\nI have not cleaned up all old issues yet.. @c25 \nI'll check this on CentOS 7, I did not know this is still a problem.. @c25 \nI did not have time to look at Apache yet.\nI added CentOS 7 example with Snap and Caddy webserver automatic Let's Encrypt example to:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. @aravindhsampath \n```\nsudo snap set wekan root-url='https://aravindh.net/wekan'\nsudo snap set wekan port='3000'\n```\nAlso allow websockets in Nginx:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config. @aravindhsampath \nYou have this missing from Nginx config:\n```\nthis section is needed to proxy web-socket connections\nmap $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {\n    default upgrade;\n    ''      close;\n}\n```. More info at point 6\nhttps://www.nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/. You have so many other denying rules that they are most likely the reason.\nI tried to help somebody to combine Nginx config of Drupal website and Wekan sub-url and failed. I mostly use Caddy.. Usually I setup Wekan in separate Nginx config file in subdomain, that works better than sub-url.. I presume subdomain did work for you.. It does not seem to be so good idea to switch to react anymore because of this:\nhttps://react-etc.net/entry/apache-foundation-bans-use-of-facebook-bsd-patents-licensed-libraries-like-react-js. Moved to #953. Reopening, will see later if there is progress on this.. @Yachikh told me that there is tutorial how to build meteor apps like Wekan to mobile:\nhttps://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/running-on-mobile\nOn Android there is bug that when apk is installed, clicking cards does not work to get card details.. @eauw \nReact Native still is evil:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/PATENTS\nWell, let's make some master plan, if someone is interested in supporting this on Commercial Support or Bountysource. Warning: This is overly simplified high level plan that misses a lot of details, device testing, fighting with appstores, fighting with always changing mobile platform libraries, updates, etc etc with a lot of effort. A lot.\n1) Create backend client, CLI-only at first. Create Haxe code to export Wekan JSON using Wekan API, using Base64 to extract attachments and store them to SQLite database. Have export from SQLite to CSV, files etc. With Haxe have versions of that code to all programming languages Haxe supports. Add more functionality to Wekan REST API if needed.\n2) Create GUI by using StablexUI example or HaxeUI. Have native apps for desktops and mobile phones. Because HaxeUI can be run also in webbrowser, at this point it could be also possible to replace Meteor.js based Wekan with Haxe based Wekan, having serverside also compiled to fast native binary in all plaforms.\n3) Add support for all other databases when using Haxe version of Wekan.. If somebody has some free time to try to do some steps of the above plan, that would also make this go forward :). @mcmenkes \nWhat content is not yet possible to add to Wekan with mobile webbrowser? I just tried adding PDF file with Android Chrome, it did work.. With upcoming Friend platform it will be possible to use Wekan in Friend mobile app:\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16240639\nFriendUPApp source will be added here: https://github.com/wekan/FriendUPApp. THERE IS FAKE APP \"SMI TEAMWORK\", IT DOES NOT WORK, AT APP STORE https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/smi-teamwork/id1232167123?mt=8 AND GOOGLE PLAY STORE https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siliconmotion.teamwork . xet7 has notified them to remove it.. @D347HxD \nBounty\nIt's possible to add bounty to:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/29708770-mobile-apps\nFor dollars euro etc FIAT money, BountySource takes a cut. For crypto money there is no cut.\nI have not yet looked how Gitcoin etc work.\nFriend\nThere is a kind of a long way to use Wekan on Android app already. It requires:\n\nInstalling Friend from git repo to some server Friend is mostly C+LAMP stack.\nThen installing Wekan app to Friend, link above\nInstalling Wekan Snap and configuring trusted url to allow Friend to iframe Wekan, or setting browser policy disabled\nUsing Friend Android app to connect to your Friend server URL.\n\nThere is also Friend iOS app, but I think it's not yet officially released. If someone is interested, invite to iOS Testflight can be had from Friend chat.\nBut, there could be problem that if Android screen is small, it could go to to Wekan mobile mode, I have not tested it yet.\nCustom Wekan Android app\nThis would require a lot of work, there is no bounty etc resources for it yet..

Today's tar.gz prebuilt release v0.19 has been built on Ubuntu 14.04 and shoud work ok after installing meteor.. What processor Synology has?. It would be easier to use latest Docker image on Mac.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. @ocdtrekkie \nIE 11 issue can be continued at existing Wefork issue:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/60\nI don't know does Microsoft Edge behave the same way, so is it the same issue.\nGenerally all still existing issues need to be reopened against wefork and all relevant info added there, if there is no existing wefork issue yet, because there it's possible to rename/combine/close issues.. @ocdtrekkie \nOk, create separate wefork issue for Edge.. Use latest Docker version.\nClosing issue.. https://wekan.github.io => Download page has installation info.. Use markdown, see screenshot at https://wekan.github.io. @AndyatFocallocal \nWould this be something different than just copying card to other list?. Copying checklist template to multiple cards already exists https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1470. Copying checklist template to multiple cards already exists https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1470. Use Snap, it has automatic updates:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. Moved to #1053. You get 100% CPU usage errors with Wekan on Node v6.\nWekan only supports Node v4.8.4 etc versions mentioned in wekan/wekan repo Dockerfile.. As you can see from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile Wekan currently uses Meteor 1.6.0.1 and it's related versions of Node.js 8.9.3 and NPM 5.5.1. Currently Meteor bugs are preventing upgrading Meteor to v1.6.1 meteor/meteor#9609 but when those are solved, I can upgrade.\nNewer version of Node, NPM etc does not work yet.. @aryeharmon \nThis is old issue. Currently build with fibers 2.0.0 works for me.\nBuild from source instructions at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases. It's possible to delete labels already..

Invitations use language that is used by admin that makes invitations in Admin Panel. This seems to be fixed already.. Moved to #825. I think this is already fixed, also see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. @yjfdl123 @jeanabraham @markwooff \nWhere is OpenID used? On what platform?. @markwooff \nDo does OpenID Connect mean possibility to use Google and Facebook login? Or how does it work?. Having feature in Wekan would require some interested new developer or having some bounty.\na) Developer\nIt would be most useful if some new developer would look at adding this to Wekan as pull request to devel branch. Current members of Wekan Team have their hands full in existing development.\nInfo about authentication options in Meteor:\nhttps://guide.meteor.com/accounts.html\nb) Bounty\nThere does not seem to be bounties for this feature:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/31666859-how-can-i-use-openid-to-login-instead-of-the-accountstemplate\nMore info about how bounties work:\nhttps://wekan.team. There is also this OpenID connect package:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/switch/accounts-oidc. @Hobbit71 \nYes you are welcome to add OpenId Connect.\nCurrently standalone Wekan has password auth for users and admin using REST API.\nThere is pull request for oauth2.\nGeneral requirements are same as in LDAP requirements, so there should be possibility to have some users belonging to LDAP and other users beloging to password auth, this would go similarly to having OpenId Connect users.\nSome related requirements are at Teams/Organizations issue.\nThose password/LDAP/OpenId Connect settings should be configured in environment variables of Docker/Snap/Source etc installs. Current environment variables are listed at Docker-Compose file, Snap Wiki and Source start-wekan.sh script. If Wekan is running at Sandstorm, so isSandstorm=true, then you should have all those new auth options not visible and disabled, because Sandstorm includes it's own SSO for all Sandstorm apps.\nYou can add related documentation to Wekan Wiki.\nIf you have any questions, please add those to this issue. Thanks!. @ToferC \nYes your team can try to do it and submit pull request.. Note: SAML is different issue #708. Moved to #466. Link does not work, and I'm unable to reproduce this. If this still happens, reopen issue and add step by step instructions how to reproduce this.. @CKoewing \nSandstorm has old version is old. I will test later is this already fixed on unreleased working newest version of Wekan for Sandstorm at #799 . This is fixed on newest Wekan that is available at Sandstorm App Market.. Moved to #794. Uploading in Firefox seems to work now.. Somebody at chat said recently that emails work OK.. @fmonthel @killua-eu \nDo you mean Linked Cards feature Wekan already has?. Moved to #799. @quants-ch\nFirst we need ideas how searching for all info on large Wekan database with lots ot cards does not slow down usage of Wekan for everyone.\nOne option would be to use mirroring to ToroDB and/or PostgreSQL so searching is much faster than in MongoDB:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-postgresql\nMirroring still needs to be fixed to work with newest Wekan https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/787#issuecomment-312125720\n. ToroDB and ToroDB + PostgreSQL does not require any changes to Wekan.\nI don't yet have info can that same be done with MariaDB etc.\nIf there needs to be changes, I'd like to know what is required.\nI'm looking to add support for more databases, not forget any database.. ToroDB now has MySQL read-only mirroring, I will add it to Platforms for Docker and Ubuntu snap when scripts are ready.. I think it's better to have search working with just MongoDB at first. There should be some delays while searching so other users of Wekan would not have such big slowdown. It's not easy to add other database like PostgreSQL to work with Sandstorm version of Wekan. There could also be view of running search queries and a way to stop them, or limit number of them.. @GhassenRjab is working on this.\n@GhassenRjab , please accept invitiation to Wekan GitHub Organization so I can assign you to this issue.. @GhassenRjab \nUsing index when searching is preferred. I would really recommend that everyone who has this as critical feature adds to this bounty, because it's really low at $5:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/32132712-feature-request-search-items\nMore details how to add to that bounty at:\nhttp://www.xet7.org/wekan. Snap has newest Wekan:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\nThat tar.gz is old.. @haperu\nDoes Wekan really write log to /run/Wekan.log still ? I did think that Wekan log location on Wekan source install is defined like this:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/start-wekan.sh\nAnd docker logs can be viewed with:\ndocker ps\ndocker logs CONTAINER-ID-HERE. @haperu \nNo problem :)  Wekan has gained more more features like move cards to other board etc meanwhile, there has been lot's of progress since months ago.. Moved to #552. Moved to #801. Moved to #466. Moved to #466. @dwrensha \nIs this Sandstorm or Wekan bug?. This is fixed on newest Wekan for Sandstorm.. @tautek \nWhere is your proof of concept? Is it on GitHub?. Moved to #457. Latest Wekan release includes feature to disable self-registration.. @ocdtrekkie \nDoes this bug still exists?. @alvaropinot \nOn card there is labels + button where you can add and edit labels. Backgroud is dimmed because you should operate on opened card.. @ocdtrekkie\nDoes this need fixing on Sandstorm?. @Nocan456 \nUse snap\nDocker destroys your data, it does not work. @Nocan456 \nCopy changes you made in your fork to VM repos/wekan directory. cd wekan , meteor - you can see live changes. or recompile all binary extensions too with rebuild-weka-meteor-1.6.sh option 3. Make new fork and submit pull request too devel branch if you want it included to all wekan platforms. See wekan github wiki developer documentation for more info about making linting fixes, etc.. Yes. Install Wekan from source.. sudo update-rc.d docker defaults. Sidebar is now by default closed.. This issues has gone offtopic. Some actual issue is continued at #828 \nIf you don't find some actual feature request already open here, open new issue.\nClosing this issue.. Moved to #802. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. @Heliotherm has not provided example file. Closing issue.. @88fingerslukee \nUse some Awesome JSON tools\nOr filtering and deleting:\n1) In Trello, use filter or search to find cards that you want to delete\n2) Export Trello board\n3) Import into Wekan\nOr using API to find and delete info:\na) Use Trello API\nb) Use Wekan REST API\n. AFAIK import JSON from Trello works currently. \nYou can also copy exported JSON file to clipboard so it's easier to paste.\n. @GhassenRjab \nPreviously when importing boards problem has been that some labels don't have names. Could it be related to this? Or do you have other ideas how to debug this?. Moved to #1174. It's now possible to delete list. Also Delete option is on menu \"More\" and there's some additional warning text, so it's not so easy to delete accidentally.. Please try with newest version. If it still happens, reopen issue.. #656 has already been fixed.. @lkisme \nOk thanks.\nClosing issue.. @msbt \nHmm, no backups before messing with database?\nMoved to #802\n. @msbt \nYou could contribute to cleanup scripts that also access MongoDB directly:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-cleanup. Moved to #783. @Jeansen \nv0.10 was released 2015-12-22, does not include Checlists etc.\nv0.13 was released yesterday.\nMoved to #785. @dirk-olmes \nDo you mean Docker or Ubuntu snap?. @dirk-olmes @valqk \nI updated Docker image of wekanteam:latest. It should be fixed now, please test.. Fixed at 4fdcc144d5342b6571b9e53e9a18640871e0c18b. @deftscorpio\nI'm currently fixing those platforms that I have access to.\nBasically fix is similar like at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-and-build-wekan\nBefore building Wekan, clone additional repos of flow-router and meteor-useraccounts to directory wekan/packages, not ~/.meteor/packages:\n```\nDownload Wekan\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan\ncd wekan\nmkdir packages\ncd packages\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/flow-router.git kadira-flow-router\ngit clone https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core.git meteor-useraccounts-core\nsed -i 's/api.versionsFrom/\\/\\/api.versionsFrom/' ~/.meteor/packages/meteor-useraccounts-core/package.js\ncd ..\n```. This already exists in Wekan:\nChange Settings/Hide system messages. @MaStrOD \nI think feature is not enabled on Sandstorm yet. You could try to install latest available .spk file to Sandstorm from Wekan releases page. It will later disable new install from source and docker version Admin Panel on Sandstorm and enable features that make sense there. Sandstorm platform is very important for me, please be patient :). Use REST API:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API#example-of-all-steps-of-create-user. See link to latest v0.21 tag etc at Wekan GitHub releases page.. Meteor does not support Node v6 yet.. @mquandalle 's latest comment on GitHub is just 5 hours ago:\nhttps://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/pull/247\nAnd  contributing to Wekan seems to require CLA like this:\nhttps://cla-assistant.io/wekan/wekan?pullRequest=639\nSo while license is MIT:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/LICENSE\nI don't know how CLA affects license, I'm not license expert.\nThen it seems that because wekan has 916 forks, lots of customization and feature additions are made all around, but they are not combined to main repo.\nThere's a roadmap here:\nhttps://wekan.io/b/MeSsFJaSqeuo9M6bs/wekan-roadmap\nBut I don't know is that roadmap up-to-date, and what core developers priorities are right now.\n. @mquandalle \nYes, you can add me as admin, I will then merge all changes back. Thanks!. I got access to Wekan 2 days ago, and now I'll start merging.. @mquandalle \nThanks! I do have both Sandstorm server and self-hosted local Wekan installed. In contributions I have tested more at self-hosted side, mostly VirtualBox appliance at https://wekan.xet7.org .\n@dwrensha has made Sandstorm fixes, releases, etc.\nI have not yet looked how to create spk packages, I have issue here:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/36. I think that in near future it'll be the same, I'll be maintaining self-hosted side and @dwrensha Sandstorm side. I do look from pull requests etc that if something makes sense for Sandstorm then enable it there based on environment variable.\nFor example in future, moving card to another board does not make sense for Sandstorm, because there   is only one board in use in one grain.. @mquandalle \nCan you give me maintainer access to Wekan Transifex, so I can move newest translations from Wefork Transifex to Wekan Transifex?. @mquandalle \nWould there sometime became any situation that I would need to do something at Docker Hub and have access there? It anyway seems that Wekan trusted builds are being generated automatically.. @mquandalle \nYes xet7 is my username at DockerHub.. @mquandalle \nI moved official chat to Vanila, we will get more developers from there:\nhttps://chat.vanila.io/channel/wekan\nNew chat badge link is at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan\nCan you give me access to wekan.io domain? That new chat channel's user kinder is designing new updated website for Wekan.. @mquandalle \nCan you give me access to https://twitter.com/wekanApp ?\nI was only able to tweet about new Wekan v1.11.1-rc1 using my own twitter account:\nhttps://twitter.com/xet7. @mquandalle \nI don't yet have access to Docker Hub so I'm unable to tag releases.. Resolved:\n- Wekan fork has been merged back to Wekan\n- I have contact to @mquandalle \n- I have Twitter access\n- I'm able to create Docker Hub tags to https://hub.docker.com/r/wekanteam/wekan\n- @mquandalle did setup redirect of wekan.io to wekan.github.io we have access to change website\n- Forum has been moved to free hosting, and Google/GitHub login works\n- @dwrensha can do Wekan Sandstorm releases, that's enough for now\nClosing issue.. Related #492 and #211. @JaromirDvoracek \nWekan is not limited in any way in goals. Anyone can contribute to it. Currently Wekan is only about 7000 lines of code without frameworks, and code is quite logically organized.. Problem is, is there some working bounty system? I have been trying to contact BountySource with no luck. Is there alternatives?. I'll get BountySource working, because it's most popular currently. There are many others, but they are hard to find even in Google search.. Ok it's now possible to try to add bounty to:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekan\nPlease tell me does it work Ok.. @vrms \nBountysource had Wekan issues pointing to wrong project that has older name Wekan had previously, so now it's fixed. There is some setup required to use Bountysource correctly.\nAnyway, I also added also Commercial Support to wiki, if somebody is interested in that.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki. @jttttttttt\nBountysource works by copying GitHub issue URL to bouyntysource page search box, with it I got this URL:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/36035028-top-level-projects\nThanks!. @jttttttttt @BravenFX @vrms @JaromirDvoracek \nPlease add comments about the mockup above, is this good for your use case?. @Serubin has not added any progress report, so I'm moving this back to my todo list.. My current plan when implementing this:\n\nNested structure for all data #2186 with import/export \nMockup for nested board groups, with tabs that have below subtabs and subsubtabs etc\nBoards:\nMy * | Subtasks | Team | Department | etc\nProject 1 * | Project 2 | Project 3 | Public | Private | Etc\nMilestone 1 * | Milestone 2 | Milestone 3\nAbove selected level is marked with * at mockup above, but in tabbed interface it would show topmost tabs, and on selected tab show below at that below level tags, etc\nThere can be unlimited levels of board groups\nGroups can be renamed\nLike linked cards/board, here can be linked groups, that show same content elsewhere in tree structure, with option of editable or view only\nBenefit of tabbed interface is that it is fast to change to other group, without scrolling down a lot\nThat other favro like view is for other spreadsheet-style list view, there is some existing Wekan issue about it but I did not find it yet.. @eabquina @howardroark2018 \n\nIf you can use Docker, you could try something similar like on SUSE docs:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-Docker-on-SUSE-Linux-Enterprise-Server-12-SP1. There has already been new Wefork release, and now Wefork is being merged back to Wekan. Docker Hub already has latest Wekan.. @tscrip \nWhat Wekan version ?\n- Docker Wekan latest ? See #659 .\n- Docker Wekan 0.10 ? I use this, seems not affected on Chrome 52.\n- Git repo, what branch ?\n- Sandstorm version ?\n. I think this is already fixed in latest Wekan, for example Docker image. Closing issue.. On Firefox 47.0 on Linux Mint 18 I get these errors:\n``` javascript\nmutating the [[Prototype]] of an object will cause your code to run very slowly; instead create the object with the correct initial [[Prototype]] value using Object.create abe2d1b0885ccadff7932659eb36a1d36886ae0f.js:9:10696\nError: language fi does not exist\n abe2d1b0885ccadff7932659eb36a1d36886ae0f.js:192:1987\nThere is no route for the path: / abe2d1b0885ccadff7932659eb36a1d36886ae0f.js:186:5954\nTypeError: n is null\n abe2d1b0885ccadff7932659eb36a1d36886ae0f.js:229:3287\n```\n. I needed to switch back to version 0.10 of wekan to get it working again, so I could access my Wekan boards, this way:\n``` bash\nStop wekan container\ndocker stop wekan\nDelete wekan container\ndocker rm wekan\nDelete wekan image\ndocker rmi mquandalle/wekan\nRun previous version of wekan in Docker\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:0.10.0\n```\n. When new working version of wekan Docker image is sometime released, it's possible to switch to it this way:\n``` bash\nStop wekan container\ndocker stop wekan\nDelete wekan container\ndocker rm wekan\nDelete wekan image\ndocker rmi mquandalle/wekan:0.10.0\nRun latest version of wekan in Docker\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan\n```\n. This is issue and zh_HK issue is fixed in latest Wekan Docker image, see README.md at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan\nClosing issue.. @wreels \nFirst you need to register your user.\nOther possibilities:\nGoogle Cloud not supported\nIf you are trying to run Wekan at Google Cloud, we have not yet found a way to enable websocket support at Google Cloud yet, and this slows down Wekan a lot and makes some functionality broken. Wekan uses websockets.\nRunning on Docker\nFor Wekan Docker image, see #659 \nMore info about Docker usage here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nAnd using Docker on openSUSE:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/SUSE/\nManual install\nLatest version in Git could be broken.\nDebugging on Chrome\nStart Chrome, click top right 3 dots menu, More Tools, Developer tools, Console. Reload page. Is there any errors? Copy paste to your reply.\nDebugging on Firefox\nStart Firefox, right click webpage, click Inspect Element, Console. Reload page. Is there any errors? Copy paste to your reply.\n. @wreels \nRemove your current install, and install Wekan Docker version 0.10.0 using links above.\n. @wreels \nBut before that, could you try on Chrome or Firefox what Javascript errors you get using info above?\n. @wreels \nStart Chrome, click top right 3 dots menu, More Tools, Developer tools, Console. Reload page. Is there any errors?\n. @wreels \nWhat openSUSE version you have? You can see it this way:\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Find_openSUSE_version\n. @wreels \nThis command shows operating system release version:\nbash\ncat /etc/os-release\nWhat text comes with that command?\n. What is your current port where wekan is?\nFor example, when URL is http://ip-adress:8080 then 8080 is the port.\n. Did you install mongodb ?\n. What is your current wekan version at Git repository?\nIn wekan git directory, type:\ngit log\nLatest topmost change in Git repo is this:\n```\ncommit 301210c87bd50c8491844182e515c0ffd97c18f6\nAuthor: Maxime Quandalle mquandalle@wekan.io\nDate:   Thu Jul 21 12:52:32 2016 +0200\nFix eslint testing\n\nPartially reverting c8705a0\n\n```\nBut we may need to use previous version from git history, that works better.\n. I'm still thinking what of these options is better for you:\n1) Try to fix your current install of Wekan, that did take a long time for you to install. This may take longer time to debug.\n2) Install Docker version. Install, upgrade, downgrade is very fast. It can be installed to run at the same time on your server, in different port, and also removed fast if needed. I'm using Docker version and it works great.\nWhat do you think?\n. Yes it's compatible.\nHere's how to install Docker and Wekan fast:\n```\nEnable repository where Docker is\nsudo SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/12/x86_64 -r ''\nInstall Docker\nsudo zypper in docker\nStart Docker\nsudo systemctl start docker\nEnable Docker to start at boot\nsudo systemctl enable docker\nFor user you use your server with, enable docker commands\nsudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G docker \nFor example:\nsudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G docker michael\nSo this is the user that has home directory /home/michael\n```\nThen to get networking enabled there's 2 options:\na) in YaST browse to Network Devices -> Network Settings -> Routing menu (f) and check the Enable IPv4 Forwarding box.\nb) If networking is handled by the Network Manager, instead of YaST you need to edit the /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 file to ensure the FW_ROUTE flag is set to yes like so:\nFW_ROUTE=\"yes\"\nThen install MongoDB and Wekan, they also restart automatically on computer boot and error exit conditions:\n```\nInstall and run MongoDB\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo\nInstall and run Wekan. Change the port 8080 to another free port that is not currently used.\nThe another portnumber 80 is internal to docker, you don't need to change that.\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:0.10.0\n```\nAnd now you can access Wekan at your http://ip-address:port\nFor backup and restore see this page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\n. Ok, your network uses proxy login, so you can add those settings:\nhttps://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7006845\n. Also if repo is already configured, you could try if installing docker already works:\nsudo zypper in docker\n. But then if your network does not have any outside network access, but your some computer has Internet access, I could write install instructions for offline install.\n. Docker works on Windows, Mac, Linux etc most computers, and transferring Wekan as files is possible.\n. Yes it's possible to get it running on Windows Server 2012. Does it have internet access?\n. Ok, from this webpage:\nhttps://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox\nClick the Windows flag Download button to download and then install it.\nIt could have some GUI, or docker commands be typed on DOS, I'll search how to get access to it.\n. Typing somewhere command \"docker\" should show it's working.\nWith these docker commands you get mongo and wekan, change port 8080 to other if needed:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:0.10.0\n```\n. No, Windows server.\n. Probably docker is already installed on your Linux server.\nTry there this:\n```\nStart Docker\nsudo systemctl start docker\nEnable Docker to start at boot\nsudo systemctl enable docker\nFor user you use your server with, enable docker commands\nsudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G docker \nFor example:\nsudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G docker michael\nSo this is the user that has home directory /home/michael\n```\n. After that you could try on Linux server installing and running Wekan, changing port 8080:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:0.10.0\n```\n. You can also try those commands on your Windows server\n. docker commands\n. You don't need to go to root if you add docker rights to virtual:\nsudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G docker virtual\n. Ok this page seems to show how on Windows to get to type docker commands:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/\n. Ok sorry, you need to go to root and type this, because virtual does not have rights to add rights to itself:\n/usr/sbin/usermod -a -G docker virtual\n. After that you can exit root and use docker as user virtual\n. @AlexanderS \nWhat should MAIL_URL be in internal network? When I installed Docker version it did not ask for mail url, if I remember correctly.\n. try:\nMAIL_URL='smtp://user:pass@mailserver.example.com:587/'\n. Nice! \nJust drop database, it will be created again on browser refresh:\nmongo\nuse admin\ndb.runCommand( { dropDatabase: 1 } )\nexit\n. Ok there's still data left. Create textfile dropall.js with this contents:\nvar dbs = db.getMongo().getDBNames()\nfor(var i in dbs){\n    db = db.getMongo().getDB( dbs[i] );\n    print( \"dropping db \" + db.getName() );\n    db.dropDatabase();\n}\nAnd then run:\nmongo dropall.js\nAnd then reload webpage.\n. Yes, textfile with vi and save.\nYou should all databases with that command: mongo dropall.js\n. For getting wekan running at boot, check node command path:\nwhich node\nAs root, create this textfile /etc/systemd/system/wekan@.service , it assumes your wekan files are under user virtual, also change full path to your node and wekan main.js:\n``\n; seeman systemd.unitfor configuration details\n; the man section also explains *specifiers*%x`\n[Unit]\nDescription=Wekan %I\nDocumentation=https://wekan.io\nAfter=network-online.target\nWants=network-online.target\nWants=systemd-networkd-wait-online.service\n[Service]\n; run user and group for wekan\nUser=virtual\nGroup=virtual\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node /path/to/main.js\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=10\n; create a private temp folder that is not shared with other processes\nPrivateTmp=true\n; limit the number of file descriptors, see man systemd.exec for more limit settings\nLimitNOFILE=8192\n; Replace these with Wekan environment variables, separated with spaces\nEnvironment=NODE_ENV=production PORT=1337\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\nThen change file permissions of that file and enable service for user virtual:\nchmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/wekan@.service\nsystemctl start wekan@virtual\nsystemctl enable wekan@virtual\n. Maybe first line is missing ; at end\nvar dbs = db.getMongo().getDBNames();\n. You may need to do as root\nservice mongo restart\nor:\nservice mongod restart\nI was already beginning to suggest trying this instead if it did not work:\nmongo\nvar mongo = db.getMongo(); mongo.getDBNames().forEach(function (dbname) { var db = mongo.getDB(dbname); db.dropDatabase(); });\nexit\n. Or maybe mongo is running under systemd, run as root:\nsystemctl restart mongo\n. Sorry, I forgot to add Wekan environment variables to service, change and add those all to the Environment line below separated by spaces:\n``\n; seeman systemd.unitfor configuration details\n; the man section also explains *specifiers*%x`\n[Unit]\nDescription=Wekan %I\nDocumentation=https://wekan.io\nAfter=network-online.target\nWants=network-online.target\nWants=systemd-networkd-wait-online.service\n[Service]\n; run user and group for wekan\nUser=virtual\nGroup=virtual\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node /path/to/main.js\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=10\n; create a private temp folder that is not shared with other processes\nPrivateTmp=true\n; limit the number of file descriptors, see man systemd.exec for more limit settings\nLimitNOFILE=8192\n; Replace these with Wekan environment variables, separated with spaces\nEnvironment=NODE_ENV=production PORT=1337\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\nI will also update previous post.\n. Ok sorry, something is messed up, as root you need to uninstall, cleanup and reinstall mongo:\nservice mongod stop\nzypper remove $(rpm -qa | grep mongodb-org)\nrm -r /var/log/mongodb\nrm -r /var/lib/mongo\nzypper -n install mongodb-org\nservice mongod start\nchkconfig mongod on\n. Thank you also for your patience in trying, and good night, let's continue later :) \n. @wreels \nI tested on same version of SUSE you have on AWS cloud, it seems that firewall settings are missing from your install. Check you have done all steps in documentation I just wrote:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-Docker-on-SUSE-Linux-Enterprise-Server-12-SP1\n. @wreels \nIt's also possible to use Wekan in VirtualBox image on your Windows Server:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/virtual-appliance\nI created yesterday new VirtualBox image, it's option 2) on that webpage.\n. Now there is new version of Wekan Docker image with new feature, and it also works on Docker on SLES12SP1. If there are any other problems, add a new issue.\nClosing issue.. Yes, Wekan is moving fast. I recommend working with existing feature requests like adding API, programmability etc and contributing them directly to Wekan, because then you don't get benefits of other new features also.. Afaik this is fixed already.. With today's merged https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1087 link to this card is visible again, and link can be drag-selected with mouse fully and copied to clipboard.\nThis fix is not yet in release version of standalone Wekan and also not on Sandstorm.. This is already fixed in Wekan, and will be in next version for Sandstorm.. I have already most new translations at Transifex.. @raz99\nPossible answers:\n1) You need to install newer npm:\nsudo npm -g install npm\n2) That install script is for init.d systems like Ubuntu 14.04, while Ubuntu 16.04 uses systemd so it would require changes. It would be easier for you to install Wekan using Docker instructions at Wekan wiki.\n. Today's release v0.19 works on Node v4.x.. My nginx-fu is a little rusty. I have used Wekan with Caddy where proxy setup is easy:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Let's-Encrypt-and-Google-Auth\nAre you sure you need all those timeouts? Wekan uses websockets that could be long running, Nginx may have some configuration needed.\nIf you use basic auth somewhere, there could be some clashes if both Caddy and Jenkins have basic auth enabled:\nhttps://forum.caddyserver.com/t/basicauth-not-working-in-conjunction-with-proxy/273\n. @jaimeagudo \nThe double slash issue is the same for Apache, Nginx and Caddy and the reason is buggy FlowRouter. @Serubin is working on testing bugfix https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/pull/691 for it, but it's not integrated to Wefork yet. Integrating requires to fork FlowRourer using multiple packages and host them under Wefork GitHub organization.\nDouble slash issue at Wefork is:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/49\nAfter your 0.10.1 version there has been many other bugfixes and new features in Wefork.. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/785. @casperl \nWell, it is still a config issue.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings. Should work now ok on today's release v0.19.. This had been already been done and merged to Wefork, and merged back to Wekan:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/pull/19. Use newest Wekan Docker image:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan. @stefnats\nCan you check does any of stats features mentioned here have this?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#stats. @mareeba @001101 @ThriLLzd \nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ. @001101 \nPlease give detailed description how ownCloud / Nextcloud Integration should work and screenshot mockups.\nI have already previously installed Wekan and Nextcloud to VirtualBox VM:\nhttps://wekan.xet7.org/release2.html\n. Does anybody have any ideas how Wekan and ownCloud / Nextcloud should be integrated?\nAny ideas anyone?. Nobody has added bounty yet.\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/37976914-feature-request-owncloud-nextcloud-integration\nhttps://wekan.team. Sometime I will do alternative file storage #142 package https://atmospherejs.com/malibun23/files but that is only about files.. Most likley it's already possible to use Nextcloud OAuth2 login to login to Wekan, I have not tested it yet.\nCalendar import/export/sync will be easier to implement after Friend calendar sync is ready. I have not yet added all Wekan Friend issues to here yet, I will add them when I have some time for it.. Probably related to pull request https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/719. Fixed at #719. Moved to #802. I added that related tutorial to wiki, and also another link to Let's Encrypt implementations:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config. @franckFleet\nThis is fixed in Wefork:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan. @franckFleet \nWefork is merged back to Wekan. Use newest Docker version:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan. Someone should test at Heroku, and do deployment guide.. @neynah \nIs this Sandstorm or Wekan issue? Does it still happen?. @dwrensha Any idea about UI issue?. Moved to #784. What are you trying to do?\nYou could run Wekan and MongoDB in containers like this:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan\n```\n8080 port can be changed to 80, or add Let's Encrypt webserver with proxy to Wekan like this:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Let's-Encrypt-and-Google-Auth\n. @debunge \nIn my example above Wekan is available at http://localhost:8080 or http://your-ip-address:8080 , for example http://192.168.1.5:8080 . It's available at local network if you:\n- don't have firewall enabled on computer running Docker or\n- have port like 8080 or 80 (whatever you run in commandline in place of number 8080) enabled on your firewall.\nDocker containers are in internal Docker network, only Wekan container port is exposed to outside. If you need to get inside containers for example to backup or restore MongoDB data, you can find docs about it at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nAll of data that is inserted to Wekan is at MongoDB database, it's not needed to backup anything else from those containers.\n. @debunge \nHow much RAM your server or VM has?\n. @debunge \nThis should be fixed now with #718 . Please test, and if there is still problems, reopen issue.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\n. This has been already merged.. @PrestonL \nCan you try with these install instructions?\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/Install-from-source. Use newest Docker or Sandstorm version:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan\nClosing issue.. This issue is for SAML on Docker/source install.\nOn https://sandstorm.io platform, SAML is already available, screenshots at:\nhttps://discourse.wekan.io/t/sso-passing-variables-through-url/493/4. @gerbsen \nAll of Sandstorm is Open Source, including SAML integration. I have tested it, and it works.\nhttps://sandstorm.io/news/2017-02-06-sandstorm-returning-to-community-roots. @gerbsen \nCurrently only way to support Sandstorm financially is to upgrade to paid account at https://sandstorm.io cloud service, it's highly recommended even if you don't use it, just to keep it running, as Sandstorm developers keep updating it at their free time on weekends.\nSupporting Wekan is detailed at https://wekan.team. @danpatdav\nYes, adding some SAML package to Wekan would make SAML login possible:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/?q=saml\nhttps://guide.meteor.com/accounts.html. @hmrodrigues \nHow it should work? What would it be used for?. @hmrodrigues \nDoes changing one affect the other one someway? Could you provide step by step instructions how this should work and how it would be useful?. Maybe something like this in kanbanflow?\n\n. Moved to here from #1092\nFrom @yarons\nI'm not sure I fully understood how to define a relation between two cards, lets pretend my card is about putting an entire footwear, I have another card for putting socks on and then I have a card for putting shoes on.\nCan I define the relation between them to be that I can't go on with the footwear card until I finish the socks and shoes cards?\nThanks!. Moved to here from #1364\nFrom @TNick\nI want to implement categories for cards. Each card would belong to exactly one category that is, by default, (un-categorized).\nThe category would determine the aspect of the cards:\n\nbackground color;\npresence / absence of a border;\nthe shape of the minicard;\n\n(v2) Each category can host a template for the card that might be applied to cards at any time.\nCategories would be organized in a tree, with one (possibly) inheriting properties from its patent(s). The tree of categories should be edited in right side panel by going to Menu->Categories. The panel needs Add sibling, Add kid, Remove, and items can be re-parented by drag-n-drop. Deleting a category deletes all its kids. All cards that ware in a deleted category are reassigned to (un-categorized).\nChanging the properties of a category (aspect of cards) can be done in same panel; each should allow inheriting from the parent / using the default for top level categories.\nChanging the category of a card should be possible when the card is expanded.\nI'm looking into implementing this feature for my personal use and, if needed, I could contribute it to the project. This is my first attempt at Wekan, so any ideas or suggestions about how to go about this are highly appreciated.. @TNick  \nYes your features are welcome to Wekan. Please look at Developer Documentation and add any questions and info or your progress to this issue. Thanks!. Related #211. Children cards implemented by @TNick at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1723. @vavrecan \nIt looks like nexe does not support building native extensions from source. Is there workaround for this?. @vavrecan \nIt there example how to use nexe? I have not used it yet.. @beppe9000 \nYou can run Wekan on Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10 by building from source. Docker could also work.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Windows\nSorry I only have Windows on very slow VirtualBox VM, it's not usable for development.\nSomeone with fast Windows computer could try does nexe work.. @beppe9000 \nI don't know does nexe work on Docker. I did not get Wekan working yet directly on Win10.\nDocker for Windows supports Linux containers like Wekan.\nThere is also VirtualBox version of Wekan at https://releases.wekan.team. For going inside container, try:\ndocker exec -it wekan-app bash\nor for mongo\ndocker exec -it wekan-db bash\nFor settings etc, use docker-compose.yml at https://github.com/wekan/wekan\nMore info here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup. I have added some beginnings of Wekan build and run scripts to:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-from-source-on-Windows. @beppe9000 \nI don't know, Dockerfile does not set any root password, it uses gosu to install most things as user wekan, and runs container as user wekan. So I don't know is there any way to use root if you don't modify and build Dockerfile yourself.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile#L271\nBut I don't know how it would be useful to run nexe in Linux Docker container. That only would make linux executeable. I would think you should try to install Wekan using Windows versions of node etc, to generate Windows executeable with nexe.. @beppe9000 \nOh, I did not know that. I'll try that, I do have Linux build environment already.. Wekan Linux Docker containers seem to work fine on Docker on Windows 10.\n\n. @beppe9000\nIf you or some other Windows developer does not get this working, this will never work.\nI can not fix this, I'm not fibers or Windows developer, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/2066#issuecomment-468680450. I fixed this and another similar in other commit, thanks!. Has conflicts, so won't merge. Closing issue.. Possibly merging later.. @maulal \nDo you have idea how to fix this?. Node version has been changed yesterday:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/master/Dockerfile\nA moment ago I merged Dockerfile fixes:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1016\nAlso see other changes:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md\nIf you notice there's changes needed elsewhere, please change it or add comment to this issue.. There will probably be more Dockerfile fixes in near future to get it working properly.\nInstalling from source works correctly though.. @Madko \nFor example Github Wiki platforms page, docker-compose wekan-mongodb. What did you use to install wekan? . https://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/13\n. @nordsmetal \nYour issue moved to #1048. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#will-my-feature-request-be-implemented. Wefork has been merged back to Wekan.\nMove this issue to #797 , please continue discussion there.. @boob99010 \nHow it shoud work?. Closing, because no description provided.. Please try newest Docker or Sandstorm version, more info at README.md at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan. @lightweight \nOn standalone Wekan there is no admin settings yet, it's coming later:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/13\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/52\nSandstorm version has admin settings.. Moved to #848. When more markdown support was added with Wekan v0.55 , we don't have anymore conversion of text to emojis. Adding emojis is only possible with adding unicode characters and images in markdown. So this bug does not exists anymore.. Wekan now uses GitHub pages at https://wekan.github.io and forum has been moved so at forum at least password and GitHub login works now.. @liulover5 \nWekan uses Node.js version 0.10.x. Install instructions are at:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/Install-from-source\nThere is feature request for newer Node.js version 4.x at:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/23\nbut nobody has started working on it yet.. Easiest way to run newest wekan is to run Docker container. This and more info at README.md at https://github.com/wekan/wekan .. With newest Wekan for Sandstorm this seems to work for me, at least with small .MOV files.\nWhen you upload .MOV file, you need to wait it to be fully uploaded, then above filename IMG_0003.MOV comes big text MOV. After that, you can right click Download link to save MOV file. And also delete MOV file.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. You can use REST API:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1037\nFor layouts, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/781. @centigrade-thomas-becker \nAre you trying to do something that is not yet possible by modifying environment variables in Docker Compose file?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. @Kaligule \nHow this feature should work? What it should look like?. @tugal \nYes developing it is fastest way to to get it to wekan. Clone wekan git repo and look with git history GUI viewer gitk or some similar how other features are made, and then submit pull request to wekan.. @tugal \nProbably it should work similarly like adding an image to card, or some other adding feature, you could look at git history for those.. @tugal said he will look at doing this. After this is done, he said he is giving bounty to me to support my maintaining of Wekan.. @tugal \nCan you add your prototype code as PR to Wekan?. @miherlosev \nYou use too new Node.js version.\nThis is how newest Wekan is installed in Linux, it works now:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/Install-from-source\nAnd this is my progress when I tried to install Wekan in Windows, but did not get it working yet:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-from-source-on-Windows\nIf you can get it working in Windows, please update Windows install instructions wiki page.\nOther way is to install to install Ubuntu on Windows version of VirtualBox.\nThere is old VirtualBox appliances at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/virtual-appliance\nbut they don't have newest changes.. @miherlosev \nI fixed install from source instructions:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/Install-from-source\nI also created new VirtualBox appliance:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/virtual-appliance. @miherlosev\n@entrptaher today added new Windows instructions, you can try does it work for you:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-from-source-on-Windows. @maduma \nThis is duplicate of https://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/58 .\nThe problem is because of MongoDB version 3.4.1 that was released 2016-12-20.\nTo run old Docker image of Wekan 0.10.0 and previous version of MongoDB, run:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo:3.4\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:0.10.0\n```\nWekan Docker image is old, if you want newest Wefork version please see:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/FAQ\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/Install-from-source\nThere is not yet Docker image of Wefork, you can follow progress at:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/33\nDowngrading to MongoDB 3.4.0 in installations from source, keeping existing data:\nsudo apt-get remove mongodb-org*\nsudo apt install -y mongodb-org=3.4.0 mongodb-org-server=3.4.0 mongodb-org-shell=3.4.0 mongodb-org-mongos=3.4.0 mongodb-org-tools=3.4.0\nI'll try to figure out later what has changed in MongoDB 3.4.1.. @maduma \nFor export/import of MongoDB data, see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data. @dklisiaris \nSorry, that wiki page was missing --drop to delete old data from MongoDB before restoring, I have added it now:\nmongorestore --drop\nThat way you don't need to manually edit data that is being restored.. Backup your data:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nThen remove your docker containers and images, and install newest Wekan with MongoDB 3.2.11 like this, uploading images and avatars works now:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo:3.2.11\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:latest\n```\nThen restore your data:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nFor newest info about Docker, see README.md on root dir of repo.\nClosing issue.. @kaefert \nYour issue moved to #1180.

Addition: Those at roadmap that have \"In Progress\" are currently in progress, nobody has started or planned others yet.. Outgoing Webhooks is now added to Wekan https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1119\nIt's already available on Docker wekanteam latest and source installs.. @carlito \nPlease include screenshot, and description how it should work.. @port22 \nBackup your data:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nThen remove your docker containers and images, and install newest Wekan with MongoDB 3.2.11 like this, uploading images works now:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo:3.2.11\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:latest\n```\nThen restore your data:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nFor newest info about Docker, see README.md on root dir of repo.\nClosing issue.. Custom Fields is diffrent issue at #807. Moved to #755. @jLouzado \nI only left link to wiki to Contributing.md file, these info about deprecation etc is not needed.\nThanks for notification about this, and moving Wefork wiki to Wekan wiki !. @tugal \nImplementation plan v1 - not good enough\nThere's no plugin system in Wekan.\nHere are the steps how somebody wanting this feature would implement this:\n1) User interface is defined by images and CSS. Currently it works so that some of those are generated with Wekan build process, that takes templates and and combines and minimizes final CSS. Building themes needs to be separated to different build script, that has option of theme name, so it saves theme to different named theme directory.\n2) Theme is then archived to .zip file.\n3) On Wekan Settings / Theme, there is list of themes, and those can be uploaded, renamed and downloaded.\n4) When new theme is uploaded, it is unarchived on server, and all files are added to MongoDB.\n5) In Theme Settings you can change what theme is used. That change then changes URLs on Wekan, so CSS points to for example themes/websitemanager/css/layout.css etc.\n. @tugal \nPlease give more detailed description of what templates you mean, english is not my native language.. @tugal \nDo you mean https://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/39 ? That's separate issue that is about board data, that could be added and copied to new board. This issue is about visual look: images, CSS, layout. Not board content.. @tugal \nI think board data also includes what theme that board uses. I'll update this issue description.. Using .zip files would be too compicated, it would result in constant zip/unzip when making changes.\nImplementation plan v2\n1) User interface is defined by images and CSS. Currently it works so that some of those are generated with Wekan build process, that takes templates and and combines and minimizes final CSS. Building themes needs to be separated to different build script, that has option of theme name, so it saves theme to different named theme directory.\n2) Like there is separate Archived cards, there would be list of Theme cards. Could same board have different views for Normal cards/Archived cards/Theme cards/other card types?\n3) Card would have new option to checkmark it as:\n[X] Theme card\n4) Add images, css, etc theme files as attachments to Theme card.\nI don't know is this good idea:\nTheme card does not need to be on the same board, it can be on separate board that Admin user also has access. But then, if only Admin has access to separate board that has Theme card, and users of board don't have access to board where Theme card is, how would we make it possible that users also have permission to see new theme on board?\n5) In board settings, select:\n5.1) 1st dropdown list of Board names that admin has access.\n5.2) 2nd dropdown list of of Theme cards in that board. This list should show only those cards that are checkmarked as Theme card.\n6) When new Theme card is selected for that one board, URLs would be changed to use CSS and images from selected Theme card.\nPro\n\nIf Wekan is running on Docker container, it can be replaced with new version of Wekan, as nothing is saved to Wekan container. All data including Themes are in MongoDB database.\nIn Sandstorm, Wekan files are cryptographically signed and read-only. All changeable data is in MongoDB database, including Themes.\nWe would not need to implement attachment upload logic for theme files\n\nCon\n\nOn Sandstorm, Theme card needs to be on same board as boards are in separate grains.\nShould Theme cards be completely separate, like Archived cards are in different place and not usually visible?\nIf Theme does make Wekan unuseable, how do we make sure that it's possible to change back to working theme?\n\nConclusion\nPlease add your comment could this design work, or have I not considered some use cases etc in this properly. It's also possible that this is still more complicated, and it would be better to just have Theme menu with upload/download of theme files as one multi-file upload/download, and maybe .zip file option if that's needed by somebody.. This is related to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/776. Please note, that any CSS and images from Trello will not accepted to Wekan.\nThere was already a lot of work done to create Wekan's own theme during previous time of DMCA takedown notice https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/92. @neooleg \nYes. Complete themes.\nAdmin Panel:\n- List theme.\n- Upload theme files, specity theme name and version number.\n- Download theme\n- Edit theme name and version number, renaming it. No multiple themes with same name and version number allowed.\n- Delete themes.\n- Possibly: List all board names and themes, modify what theme is used.\nBoard settings:\n- Select theme name and version number from dropdown list.\nThis Themes, API, programmability etc makes working like Jira possible:\n- Multiple boards with different themes\n- Showing cards vertically or horizontally\n- Clicking something goes to another board that has another theme\nAPI, programmability etc makes also integration possible https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/issues/7. @neooleg\nThere is separate open issues about API etc, I did not have time to link to those issue numbers. This issue is only about themes.. I'm rethinking about Themes feature, mostly by having only minimal changes that other features need integrated in Wekan.\nFor Jira use case there would be only those different layouts where horizontal / vertical can be changed, and all this while still showing Wekan logo and having Wekan look and feel.\nFor full theme changes, users would need to use them on browser plugins so they would not make Wekan broken so easily.. I did chat with one company about implementation of General Themes feature, it they choose to try to implement this. Currently many companies have hacked Wekan web interface to:\na) have some kind of company theme, that is acceptable use\nb) to have Trello theme, that if you use images and CSS from Trello, is a DMCA violation and also why new Wekan theme was developed years ago. Having Trello theme in Wekan repo, or hosted elsewhere by Wekan Team, is not legal.\nFor the a) case, requirements for implementing full themes feature:\n- Upload/Download themes to Wekan as .zip archives to board, stored at MongoDB\n- Select what theme board uses\n- In Admin Panel see what boards have what themes uploaded, and way to globally reset to original Wekan theme, or reset theme of one board, so boards that have broken theme could be accessed again\n- Documentation to Wekan GitHub wiki, how to update custom themes, when there is new feature added to Wekan, that changes original Wekan theme.\nIf some themes implementation has different way of implementing this, it could be good starting point also.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#policy-about-wekan-ui-changes. Possible to be related to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/698. @yatusiter \nIt seems that your pull request has been accepted to Meteor-CollectionFS.\nDoes something need to be changed in Wekan code to use it?. @yatusiter \nWekan uses old version of Meteor. When I rebuilt Wekan, fix was not there. Can you test?. @yatusiter \nI will look at this later and make necessary changes. Thanks!. @nztqa \nYour issue is moved to #1031\nThis issue is already closed.. Moved to here from #1338\n@whittssg \nCan you clean up that https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/446 and add as new pull request Wekan devel branch?. Moved to #2165. @romu70 \nCould you do some Google searching for projects that make interface like Mongo but translate it to another database backend like PostgreSQL or MySQL ? And also find examples how Meteor / Mongo projects have added support for other databases?\n. @romu70 \nSomebody else did ask about this before, so I added it to roadmap. I have not had time to add all feature requests from original wekan project to roadmap yet.\n. From @romu70 on November 16, 2016 10:58\nThanks a lot, so I think you deserve a little explanation ;-)\nSelf hosting is great but raises some issues, even more if you plan to do self-hosting with Docker:\n- the more is the list of apps you want to host, the more is the list of required data back ends, and this makes self hosting more and more difficult, and resources consuming, both human and hardware\n- when you self-host an application through Docker, you absolutely need to externalize the data if you want to be able to update the Docker without loosing things.\nPersonally, I don't need specifically a SQL DB, Redis would be great also, and maybe easier for switching from a NoSQL DB, but I don't know well both.\nThanks a lot.\n. From @pierreozoux on November 17, 2016 10:18\nMeteor is using Mongo.\nWekan uses Meteor as a Framework.\nAs long as Meteor doesn't allow other db, wekan can't use any other db.\nClosing this for now.\nFeel free to reopen once meteor add support to other db.\n. @pierreozoux \nThere can be some way to use Meteor with other databases, I did see some search results about that, it's not impossible. This is looking for somebody needing other database support to do the research.\nReopening issue.\n. From @aegrey on December 18, 2016 2:34\nMeteor said last year it was a high priority, but with MongoDB's growing popularity I would assume it's become less so.   \nThere's a library that does it (numtel:mysql - haven't used it in a while). Hasn't been updated since mid-2016, but his example project is active (https://github.com/numtel/meteor-mysql-leaderboard). For those interested, you could try integration in your fork (I am just delving into Wekan's code, so couldn't say how heavy of a lift it'd be).\n. Currently Wekan works like this:\nFrontend Javascript <=> Backend Node.js <=> MongoDB\nIs there this kind of Database Query converter somewhere?\nFrontend Javascript <=> Backend Node.js <=> Database Query converter <=> MongoDB/MariaDB/PostgreSQL etc\nWhen Node.js sends MongoDB query, Database Query converter would then use something like search-replace/regex/parsing to convert it to MariaDB syntax, get results from MariaDB and send them in MongoDB format back to Node.js.\nThis Database Query converter would have it's own web interface, where database queries can be translated to different database syntax, storing those at converter's own syntax database. If some syntax was not able to be converted, there would be error listed at error log page of converter's own web interface.\nThis way we could use any database, so if there is already some existing database then it's not required to install MongoDB, just use existing database.\nThat Database Query converter could be also used for auditing, stats, logging, permission management, limiting to only allowed queries, exposing REST API to other software etc.. I do not mean changing anything in Wekan code.\nI mean replacing MongoDB with, for example, single executeable binary:\n- It works in same port as MongoDB, port could be changed in environment variable:\n- That binary could be programmed with any language, like Go\n- The same binary could also include database server that's made with Go\n- When receiving MongoDB query, it could use internal database server, or convert query to other database syntax, connect to that database, get results, convert results to MongoDB format, and return to that app that uses MongoDB. I mean any app that uses MongoDB, not just Wekan..

Ok I got ToroDB working on docker-compose, so this it Wekan reporting with new LibreOffice 3.5 native PostgreSQL support, using Wekan <=> MongoDB <=> ToroDB => PostgreSQL read-only mirroring. I will create new repo wekan-postgresql for this. You can use any programming language, Office suite or reporting package to get read-write MongoDB data and read-only PostgreSQL data with SQL queries.\n\n. Ok I have now added docker-compose.yml etc code to:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-postgresql. At ToroDB website was said, that it could be possible to use only ToroDB/PostgreSQL and not write data to MongoDB at all, completely replacing MongoDB, but I did't yet figure out how to do it.. @romu70\nDoes this help with your use case in any way?. @gortiz @ahachete \nSome time ago I tried wekan-postgresql and it had errors starting, has something changed in docker-compose file?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-postgresql\nIs it possible to test Wekan with ToroDB server?. @gortiz @ahachete\nWhen working with Node.js applications, have you come across errors like at #1096 ? If yes, do you have ideas how to debug and fix ?. @killua-eu \nAre there Meteor.js projects that use JSON support or REST API in MySQL ?\nWhat does \"relatively easy\" mean in practice? How to convert Meteor.js project to use MySQL ?. @rautamiekka \nDatabase abstraction layer by using functions would make supporting more databases much easier.\nIs there documentation how to port Meteor.js/MongoDB application like Wekan to it?. @rautamiekka \nIf you have time to try even beginning steps of implementation to see what is actually required, it would be nice.\nThere is no requirements for spending a long time or being awesome at it.. Does somebody know would it be possible to use this database orm with Meteor.js app like Wekan?\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/typeorm. Maybe https://www.rethinkdb.com if possible. @HLFH \nPlease see 2) of https://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/FAQ.

From @soohwa on November 17, 2016 17:6\nI found https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/353 and https://discuss.wekan.io/t/restrict-registration/71/3\nAnd with the filter : https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AFeature%3AUser-accounts\nAnd on the original chat at Mar 20 18:42 (Mahan @laupkram)\nAccountsTemplates.configure({                                          // 11\n  forbidClientAccountCreation: true,\n  defaultLayout: 'userFormsLayout',                                    // 12\n  defaultContentRegion: 'content',                                     // 13\n  confirmPassword: false,                                              // 14\n  enablePasswordChange: true,                                          // 15\n  sendVerificationEmail: true,                                         // 16\n  showForgotPasswordLink: true,                                        // 17\n  onLogoutHook: function () {                                          // 18\n    var homePage = 'home';                                             // 19\n    if (FlowRouter.getRouteName() === homePage) {                      // 20\n      FlowRouter.reload();                                             // 21\n    } else {                                                           //\n      FlowRouter.go(homePage);                                         // 23\n    }                                                                  //\n  }                                                                    //\n});                                                                    //\n                                                                       //\n['signIn', /*'signUp',*/ 'resetPwd', 'forgotPwd', 'enrollAccount'].forEach(function (routeName) {\n  return AccountsTemplates.configureRoute(routeName);                  //\n});\n. @soohwa \nThanks! I'll assign this to myself and start working on this.\n. There's\n\ntranslation updates mixed with pull request\ncomments for variable naming that need to be checked and fixed\n\netc so this will take some time.. From @soohwa on November 22, 2016 5:19\nNo pb, anyway it's a good news that is underway ^^. @lkisme\nAdmin panel and option to disable self-registrations are highly requested features, thanks!\nPlugin system will not be implemented because of issues described in #781\nI'm maintainer of Wekan currently. @mquandalle has not responded to requests mentioned in Wekan roadmap board for a long time.. @ocdtrekkie\nI would really need a way to build Sandstorm .spk file to test how to disable something at Sandstorm:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/823\n. Moved to #823. @dwrensha \nAdmin Panel does need enabling in MongoDB, so I presume this does not currently affect Sandstorm:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v0111-rc2-2017-03-05-wekan-prerelease\nWith some future import/export feature it could probably be enabled, but not otherwise.. From @pierreozoux on December 2, 2016 10:34\nActually, this is not really related to wekan, but more to https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/email. @whittssg\nPlease add all info as described in 2) of\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/FAQ\nSo then when someone has time for it, those details are already available here.. From @ocdtrekkie on December 5, 2016 17:42\nThis isn't necessarily a solution to the issue, as I know many people would like LDAP support in Wekan itself, but as a reference for those who may be looking at this issue in the future: It is currently possible to use either LDAP or SAML login with Wekan via Sandstorm for Work, which is open source, but is not free.. From @whittssg on December 5, 2016 18:5\n@xet7 I am not quite sure how the other points in the FAQ would look. If an Admin page is being worked on maybe it could be a checkbox in there with a settings page for the LDAP server, port etc. I am not sure if the plugin system is working yet in Wekan but if it was maybe we could just create a LDAP login plugin ( i did something similar for my Internal NodeBB forum). @whittssg \nOk, I did read that previous issue myself, so there was this mention of LDAP in Meteor:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/typ/accounts-ldap\nI did not read more carefully if somebody tried to work on this before, that's what I was asking about.. From @whittssg on December 5, 2016 18:17\nAh OK, I searched PRs etc on the original but I didn't see anything in regards to LDAP.. From @quimnuss on December 15, 2016 12:3\nWe could bring this further by allowing parsing the e-mail so it goes to a specific board/card/comment.\nI'm testing different options before commiting to one project and I'm am greatly interested on having this feature. I'd try to implement it myself if necessary, but I just found wekan a couple days ago so I'm yet not so familiar with the code :)\nAlternatively, how could a script on the server add a card/comment ? That would superseed the whole issue as the e-mail parser could be independent of wekan, which in turn is probably related to feature request #43 \nThis request was also present on the wekan issue tracker: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/339\n. @quimnuss \nI do recommend that you clone Wefork repo, don't add Meteor and Node.js modules. Then start reading code, it's quite logically divided to subfolders. I recommend you try implementing API #43 and Email #42 , and please ask any questions you might have about design, code etc. Wefork team is currently still small so additional contributors would speed things up. I have not yet had time to add more developer documentation, but some starting points are https://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/FAQ and https://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/Install-from-source .\nThere are some previous discussions about API in original https://wekan.io forums and GitHub issues.\nWefork has some SMTP settings probably for forgot password functionality, but I have not tested it. There is no IMAP settings I think.\nThis email issue is mostly about:\n- using some IMAP server to receive mail, and then using script to read that new mail and Wefork API to add content somewhere\n- When something happens Wefork, have it send Email using SMTP.. @photoTed \nFastest way to get some feature to Wekan is to try to implement it and submit pull request to devel branch. As there is some notification code already, that would be good starting point to try to modify.. @photoTed\nI recommend:\n- installing from source to Ubuntu 16.04 64bit, instructions at Wekan GitHub wiki\n- using gitk to view history of git commits, how different features are implemented\n- just add code to those places needed\nAnd ask questions if you get stuck.. @kaitoan2000 \nNot all notifications are implemented yet. There is some notification code in Wekan, but I have not tested does it work and when triggers happen.. @kaitoan2000 \nI don't know. Somebody needs to check the code with Git history viewer like gitk, or reading the source. And then making changes if needed.. Moved from #1193 to here.\nFrom @mxmehl\n\nThere're three things to be improved when it comes to WeKan's notifications:\n\n\nA user doesn't receive a mail when someone mentions her (@user) in a card which she isn't participating in, or if she's not watching the whole board. This doesn't make sense to me as there's the possibility to mention single users to raise their attention. This could be a global user setting (\"Notify me every time someone mentions me in a card\").\n\n\nThe mailing could be a bit more verbose in the subject, similar to how Github notification mails look like. There should at least be the title of the card in the subject. So instead of Activity Notification it could be Activity Notification: this is the card's title. \n\n\nAdditionally, the \"From:\" of the email could be the person triggering the notifications. So instead of admin@example.com it would be John Doe <admin@example.com.\n\n\nThanks a lot :)\n\n. @xxpqxx\nThere is write card API:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API\nSo you create code that reads received email, and writes to card.\nFor more complete integration example, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs . It needs swimlanes fix though, there is issue at that repo. . @romu70 \nAll Wekan data is at MongoDB:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nTell me if something does not work after changing to Wefork newest version:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/wiki/Install-from-source\nThen I could look if some migration scripts is needed.\nPlease try on separate non-production system copy first.\n. From @romu70 on December 14, 2016 16:46\nTo be honest, I don't run Wekan for the moment, and I'm looking at the best way to run it on my Synology nas. I thought I could run the SPK provided by the old project, but it targets an old version of the DSM, so it's dead. But the \"install from source\" is great, I can try to build a Docker image to run it. Thanks. . @romu70 \nProblem with Synology nas ARM is that AFAIK Meteor is available only for x86_64 (and probably x86) so in those instructions if you don't have appropriate Node.js version you would use nvm instead of n to compile nodejs, and also with Meteor it could need a lot of recompiling. You could try to do Google search if somebody has managed to get Meteor working on ARM.. @romu70 \nAlso Sandstorm currently is x86_64 only, it's not available for ARM.. From @romu70 on December 14, 2016 16:57\nThat's why I bought a x86_64 Syno. It's just a PC with some nice nas features around.. @romu70 \nNice :) Ok try to install it and tell me how it goes.\nYesterday on original Wekan Gitter chat @weaktyper also was in progress to create new Dockerfile, it relates to https://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/33 and I presume it will be contributed to Wefork replacing original Dockerfile if one pull request is accepted to some Docker base image of Meteor.. From @ocdtrekkie on December 14, 2016 17:15\nIf you have an existing Sandstorm grain backup for Wekan, it will work when restored to another Sandstorm server with Wekan installed. Sandstorm recognizes both as the same app.\nBut I'm a bit confused about your mention of the Wekan SPK (which is a Sandstorm app package) targeting \"the DSM\", because AFAIK, Wekan SPKs \"just work\" with Sandstorm, and generally don't work with anything else.\nI recall the Sandstorm team wanting to support the Synology, but at the time, I think there was an issue with kernel features. (Though Sandstorm works on more kernels now, and they mentioned it should work better with the Synology now.) I think the best thing to do would be to tag some Sandstorm people here. @kentonv @paulproteus. @dwrensha has made Sandstorm-specific updates to Wefork, although I have not looked does Sandstorm use only Wefork now. Sandstorm may have additional requirements of kernel etc. For Sandstorm version multiboard features etc are not in use as environment variable option, as there's just one board object at a time that is set as public, and because Sandstorm handles authentication, sandboxing in grains etc.\nThose install from source instructions are for standalone Wekan, without Sandstorm. Standalone version requires just Node.js, MongoDB and Meteor.. From @ocdtrekkie on December 14, 2016 17:45\n@xet7 The newest version of Wekan on the Sandstorm App Market is based on Wefork. Sandstorm has an entry that tells it the app key David used for Wefork is a suitable replacement for the Wekan key held by Maxime, so people can easily upgrade from Wekan to Wefork.\nIf @romu70 wants to use Sandstorm on his device, and it isn't working, he can file an issue at github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm which may be a better place for that chat. But I am unsure exactly what we're trying to do.\n@romu70 Do you have any current Wekan data you need to migrate? Is it from standalone Wekan or a Wekan grain backup from Sandstorm? And then are you looking to use standalone Wekan, or Wekan on Sandstorm on your Synology?. @romu70 \nWhat kernel version does that Synology run? Are you able to upgrade kernel? I'm just thinking because Docker and Sandstorm both probably use same recent enough kernel features for sandboxing.. From @ocdtrekkie on December 14, 2016 18:9\nSandstorm's current kernel requirement, FWIW, is 3.10, and it no longer requires userns: https://sandstorm.io/news/2016-11-10-rhel-centos-arch-support\nMeteor, on the other hand, pretty much runs on anything x86_64.. @weaktyper\nNode serves that app. Meteor is the framework of Javascript etc code.. From @kentonv on December 15, 2016 3:59\nPossible point of confusion: Synology packages are also called \"SPK\"s. These have nothing to do with Sandstorm. :/. From @ocdtrekkie on December 15, 2016 4:39\n@kentonv Wow. That explains so much.. From @romu70 on December 15, 2016 8:32\nPoint to @kentonv. The confusion is all mine, sorry if I introduced some doubts in there. Yes, I thought the official Wekan SPK was a package for Synology, I didn't know Sandstorm uses the same extension.\nFinally this is good, I just have to focus on the Docker image.. @romu70 \nYou can follow https://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/33 about progress of self-created and official Docker image.. From @romu70 on December 15, 2016 8:58\nI'm on it, thanks.. Upgrades to newest version of Wekan work, and this issue has gone somewhat offtopic. If you have any problems, please add new issue.\nClosing issue.. I don't know how to reach someone that has youtube video of vote feature:\nhttps://youtu.be/8jQPqcNgKA0. From @soohwa on December 15, 2016 13:33\nAnd / or maybe the possibility to import the json just exported (from wekan) ?. From #388\n@hsduk\nHi\nFYI: I have pushed a card clone feature to https://github.com/hsduk/wekan/tree/plugin-simple-timer\n. Also related to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/446. @m1L31s \nYes.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Roadmap\nCopying cards within one board https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1204 will be merged soon.\n. @remcooverweg \nThere is no feature yet to move card to another board at Standalone and Sandstorm. For Standalone development is still in progress:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Roadmap\nIf this feature is important for you, in Standalone and/or Sandstorm, please add to bounty:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/41780302-add-feature-move-or-copy-cards-from-one-board-to-another. @killua-eu \nBounty to @GhassenRjab :+1: . @killua-eu \nYes there's that problem, I did use other login method like forgot password or something else, with those I was able to login.. What is required for release?\nI could commit current devel to master branch. What else needs to be done?. From @HLFH on December 16, 2016 11:0\nWhat is required for release? You could see that here: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases/download/v0.11.0-rc2/wekan-0.11.0-rc2.tar.gz\nFor now, there is no new release there: https://github.com/wefork/wekan/releases\nFrom my side, I'm not sure how the previous developer M. Q. was releasing it but it shouldn't be difficult.. @HLFH \nOk I'll try to make a release.. Done.. From @HLFH on December 16, 2016 12:27\nThanks!. From @HLFH on December 16, 2016 12:30\n@xet7 EDIT:  but shouldn't we get also a tarball? like here: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases/download/v0.11.0-rc2/wekan-0.11.0-rc2.tar.gz\nM.Q. was also releasing a .tar.gz tarball with less files than the full source code. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases/. @HLFH \nYes there is already tarball at:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/releases\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/releases/tag/v0.11.0\nDirect link:\nhttps://github.com/wefork/wekan/archive/v0.11.0.tar.gz. @HLFH \nHuh what kind tarball Meteor bundle is that? I'll try to figure out later how to create it.. From @HLFH on December 16, 2016 12:40\nIt seems that for now you provide the source code tarball but not the Wekan/Wefork release tarball.\nOk. Thanks. I'll search also from my side.. @HLFH \nPlease do search, that would help a lot. I need to continue my actual non-related work project.. From @AlexanderS on January 2, 2017 16:53\n@HLFH It's the meteor bundle. Created with meteor bundle <output.tar.gz>.. From @HLFH on January 2, 2017 23:7\n@AlexanderS Thank you. Nevetheless, \"WARNING: 'bundle' has been deprecated. Use 'build' instead\".\nSo, I'm doing that:\nbash\nsu - wekan -s /bin/bash\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" # This loads nvm\nnvm install 0.10.48\nnvm use 0.10.48\nwget https://github.com/wefork/wekan/archive/v0.11.0.zip\nunzip v0.11.0.zip\ncd wekan-0.11.0/\nnpm install\nsudo -u wekan meteor build --server-only ../wekan-0.11.0\ncd ../wekan-0.11.0/\ncurl --upload-file ./wekan-0.11.0.tar.gz https://transfer.sh/wekan-0.11.0.tar.gz\n\nUsing the --directory option on meteor build will produce a bundle directory instead of the tarball. So, I don't use this option there.\n\n@xet7 Could you add me as a Wefork collaborator, so I will be able to submit/edit releases here when necessary?\nhttps://transfer.sh/5obRm/wekan-0.11.0.tar.gz\nOR: wekan-0.11.0.tar.gz. From @soohwa on January 3, 2017 0:47\n@HLFH thx :-) I updated https://github.com/soohwa/sps/blob/master/example/docs/1/wekan.md with your tarball https://github.com/wefork/wekan/files/681473/wekan-0.11.0.tar.gz. Wefork has been merged to Wekan.\nToday released new Wekan v1.11.1-rc1 prerelease version includes precompiled version.. @dwrensha \nI added that SPK to Wekan v0.11.1-rc1 release:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases. From @tml on January 18, 2017 16:14\nWith the Trello purchase, I suspect this might be something that a number of people become interested in rather quickly.. @tml \nIn standalone Wefork it's already possible to import Trello export JSON files, including attachment images. For example using VirtualBox appliance at https://wekan.xet7.org\nThis feature is not enabled for Sandstorm Wefork.. From @ocdtrekkie on January 18, 2017 16:20\nIf the import from Trello requires actually logging into Trello, rather than importing like an export file, that'd probably be why, since it requires a network opening to do, and Sandstorm sandboxes the application. Future updates to Sandstorm should make this easier to do securely.. Checklists are not imported yet, because that feature #11 is not yet merged to Wefork. Some other features can be missing also.. From @tml on January 18, 2017 16:30\n@ocdtrekkie I have an export file from Trello, and a standalone Wekan knows how to deal with those; there's just no opportunity to provide that information to the Wekan grain created by Sandstorm.. From @ocdtrekkie on January 18, 2017 16:32\nShould definitely tag @dwrensha on this one then.. @tml\nThanks, I closed #800 now. Duplicate came when I used https://github-issue-mover.appspot.com/ to move issues from Wefork to Wekan. @FiloSottile said at #549 \nI'd love this, too. My understanding from #113 is that #430 should make this possible.\nI have not checked those yet.. @ajrossnz @brevilo \nPlease do not wait. In Open Source, although current code is available for free, the way to use it in your company is to have a programmer in your company implementing missing features and submitting them as pull requests.\nAccording to Open Hub, Wekan code is only about 7000 lines so it's very small when comparing to other software. With git history viewer like gitk it's possible to see how different features are implemented.\nTo implement this, check current features for exporting and importing, and have the feature enabled in Sandstorm by using environment variable isSandstorm = true like is at wekan/sandstorm.js .\nIn wiki there is Developer Documentation.\nThanks!. Currently dropdown menu on Wekan looks like this:\n\nIn addition to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1134 for Import to work on Sandstorm @GhassenRjab would need to add:\n1) Check that isSandstorm variable is true https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/sandstorm.js\n2) Add to board menu above Export also Import\n3) When Import is clicked, there would be paste screen and warning above it that imported board will delete all existing data on board and replace it with imported board.\nI don't know is mapping of imported board users to Sandstorm users somehow different than in standalone Wekan. @dwrensha do you know about this?\nAlso on same menu where is Outgoing Webhooks. Is there a way to make it work on Sandstorm?. @ocdtrekkie @dwrensha @kentonv\nOn menu above there is Archived boards.\nCurrently on Wekan the All boards link is hidden, and only one board is used on Sandstorm.\nWhen importing new Wekan board, should current board be archived, and new board be made visible?\nThen on Board menu / Archived Items there would be Cards, Lists and Boards.\nOr should there instead be:\n- All boards page and similar functionality like in standalone Wekan?\n- Ability to copy cards/lists etc to some other board on the same grain, and also to other grain at Sandstorm?. @ocdtrekkie \nI think in that case, that when importing new Wekan board:\n- current board should be archived\n- new board be made visible\n- on Board menu / Archived Items there would be Cards, Lists and Boards, with options to restore and delete board.. Also when restoring archived board, current board should be archived. Only deletion is from archived boards.. Hmm, I don't know yet. There will be additional import export options and they could be more easily found on Wekan Board menu. AFAIK something (maybe restoring board?) was already left out from Sandstorm import export because of complexity to implement it.. Automatic builds for Sandstorm would be nice, like there is currently for Docker and Ubuntu snap edge.. Code for Export and import boards in Sandstorm is included in today's Wekan release tagged v0.30 .. I did make my own Sandstorm key with:\nspk keygen\nand add it's public key it displayed after that command to sandstorm-pkgdef.capnp.\nThen I generated wekan-0.32.spk on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit on VirtualBox:\nmeteor-spk pack wekan-0.32.spk\nWhen I tried to upload it to local Sandstorm, I got this error:\nUpload failed: 500 Internal Server Error.\nUnpacking SPK failed; is it valid?. I wrote instructions how I did get newest Wekan built for Sandstorm.\n@GhassenRjab \nWith instructions above, could you test how to Export and Import Wekan board correctly? I tried to setup names for all labels, tried to map users, and got errors that:\n\nJSON is not formatted correctly\nI did not map users correctly\n\nMaybe user mapping in Sandstorm is different?. @ocdtrekkie \nCurrently @GhassenRjab is working on some Import Export fixes, we can be add those later.\nI think it's not needed to hide anything additional from Wekan, we'll see first how current features work. Import Export can work in some cases. It's better to just get current version released for Sandstorm.\nI will make new release of Wekan and then also make Wekan spk for Sandstorm.. @GhassenRjab \nWorks:\n1) Standalone Wekan Export => Standalone Wekan Import\n- But: Start date is not imported. Only Due Date.\n2) Standalone Wekan Export => Sandstorm Wekan Import\n- But: Start date is not imported. Only Due Date.\nDoes not work:\n1) Standstorm Wekan Export => Standalone Wekan Import\n- Something wrong in Sandstorm Wekan JSON file\n2) Standalone Wekan Export => Standstorm Wekan Import => Standstorm Wekan Export\n- JSON file size is zero.\nExported JSON files in .zip below.\nwekan-export.zip\n. @GhassenRjab \nInfo how to test on Sandstorm. TODO: Test does unreleased version of newest Wekan for Sandstorm has fix for #541 and #1192 already. . I tested importing Trello JSON on Wekan Sandstorm version. It seems to work, but attachment image is not imported, most likely because Wekan grain does not have Sandstorm-compatible outside network access implemented.\n@GhassenRjab today tested those JSON files in above wekan-export.zip file. In the first file, one of the activities (addMember) has a userId: null. This will cause the interruption of the import.\nHe will see if this happens with standalone Wekan.. I tested .spk file in Sandstorm. Upgrade of existing Wekan did work. When I then imported board from Trello JSON file, images did not import. From Archives menu I was able to restore previous board that was in Sandstorm before importing board from Trello.. About that Copy URL of a card #1188 feature, button in Wekan Sandstorm version copies this kind of URL:\n/b/sandstorm/libreboard/RANDOMTEXT1\nWhile full URL to Sandstorm is:\nhttps://something.sandcats.io/grain/RANDOMTEXT2/b/sandstorm/libreboard/RANDOMTEXT1. @GhassenRjab and I just got import export working on Wekan standalone and Sandstorm, I just need to make proper release of Wekan and figure out changing .spk key.. Wekan v0.34 is now available at official Sandstorm app market. It's not in experimental anymore.. From @tml on January 18, 2017 16:14\nWith the Trello purchase, I suspect this might be something that a number of people become interested in rather quickly.. @tml \nIn standalone Wefork it's already possible to import Trello export JSON files, including attachment images. For example using VirtualBox appliance at https://wekan.xet7.org\nThis feature is not enabled for Sandstorm Wefork..

Future updates to Sandstorm should make this easier to do securely.. Checklists are not imported yet, because that feature #11 is not yet merged to Wefork. Some other features can be missing also.. From @tml on January 18, 2017 16:30\n@ocdtrekkie I have an export file from Trello, and a standalone Wekan knows how to deal with those; there's just no opportunity to provide that information to the Wekan grain created by Sandstorm.. From @ocdtrekkie on January 18, 2017 16:32\nShould definitely tag @dwrensha on this one then.. This issue was moved to wekan/wekan#799. From @HLFH on December 19, 2016 15:44\nHum. I'm testing it right now again and it seems it works within some markdown.\nCan you confirm it from your side ? So then we will close https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/556 and https://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/53\nThanks!. @ProCycleDev @HLFH\nI upgraded xss dependency to newer version. Can you test Docker image, is this still a problem?. @aegrey \nThis is related to other Wekan issues in this way:\n13 Has some code for admin interface, but probably does not include teams\nFor making Wekan programmable, AFAIK there is no code for these yet:\n43 API\n42 Using Email with API\n49 Auto add user name to a moved card\nThere is currently not much technical documentation of Wekan, only some related to using it at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source\nWekan code is mostly Javascript, templates, CSS and some YAML. It uses Meteor Javascript framework, Node.js for serverside, and MongoDB database that also is Javascript-based.\nOn codebase, there is check for environment variable, is it running:\n1) Wekan standalone version, when it has multiboard features, login etc etc although disabling login on #13 is not implemented yet.\n2) Running on Sandstorm, then only one board is in use and is set to public, because Sandstorm provides authentication, sandboxing in grains etc.\nWefork code is quite logically divided to subfolders. I recommend that after cloning that repo to your computer:\n1) You don't add Node.js modules or Meteor framework to there\n2) Read the code and make notes\nIf possible, it would be nice to have additional MongoDB database collections (or \"tables\" as in SQL database terms) for additional information added, that would make upgrading from previous versions of Wefork easier. Some users have a lot of data. So in new version if collection does not exists, then create it.\nPlanning and documenting technical requirements would be a good way to start. This would also prevent duplicate work when Team/Organization admin is different than the simple previous #13 implementation.\nCurrently Wekan team is quite small, so having some new technical documentation of code structure would also help newcomers to get familiar with it.. @aegrey \nThanks! It's very nice to get tech specs for this.\nSince your previous post to this issue Wekan has gained many more features, I will also add there recent ability to change email address.\n. Moved to here from #1220 \nFeature request by @DukeW\n\nIt would be nice to be able as an admin to take \"ownership\" of boards. I have a Wekan instance running for 30 people, and some people don't archive there boards when there done. I would like to be able to take ownership of these old boards and archive them my self. Also sometimes a board creator is not present and new people need to be added to a board, right now I don't have a way of doing this.\n\nReply by @xet7\n\nIt's possible to change you as board admin at MongoDB database, that link is mentioned at Platforms page. There is no Web UI for it yet. I have not tried can it be done with REST API.. @aegrey \n\nCan you add your in-progress tech specs to this issue?. @thuanpq is working on this.\n@thuanpq , please accept invitation to Wekan GitHub Organization so I can assign you to this issue.. Moved to here from #1397\nFrom @Logicbloke \n\nHi,\nAs a project manager, I sometimes have to dispatch task to team members, but I'm mostly using one board per project rather than one board per team member. Why is it that any member added to the board with the normal permissions can edit other cards other than the ones assigned to him? To the very list bring the permissions down to the lists level.\nThe comment permissions look OK for this kind of thing but it's preventing the team member for ticking the checklists.\nAre kanban boards supposed to be one board per team member?\nThanks!\n\n@Logicbloke \nPlease add details how this feature would work step by step, and please add to bounty for this issue so there is enough funding for building these features, more details about bounties at http://www.xet7.org/wekan. Correction: ss+ is working on adding Teams/Groups feature.\nAfaik @thuanpq is not working on this feature.. @AndyatFocallocal \nWhat 'invite link' feature? Please give link to existing or new issue about that.. @coolacid @d3dbit \nFor those interested, please participate to bounty or participate to development costs with Commercial Support, on that page is also bounty info.\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/41780380-add-feature-teams-organizations-similar-to-trello. If all goes well, I'll maybe get teams feature from ss+ next week, so I'll add this note to myself so I'll check 2018-07-27 did it happen.. I have some parts of teams feature in progress at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/feature-teams . It still needs some work, Admin Panel part is not visible currently, etc.. Moved to here from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2029\nFrom @saurabharch\n\nAdmin can create credential of new user of team member and bypass the user verification, bcz some email transactional process is not working well so need new features like this.\n\n@saurabharch Do you mean adding new user in Admin Panel ?. @luke5sky \nI would recommed disable user using API.\nIt's also possible to take ownership of users boards but it's not documented well yet.\nIt's not recommeded to delete user because it can break Wekan board.\nWhat should happen to user's data when user is deleted? It's not implemented properly yet.. @JonasDralle @rterwedo\nThis feature is waiting for some interested ones to participate to bounty for this issue, so that I could start working on this, helping me to pay my bills.\nhttps://wekan.team/bounties/index.html\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/41780380-add-feature-teams-organizations-similar-to-trello. @rterwedo \n$700 so I can start. Yes, I will add more details about superadmin etc when I think a little more about roles/permissions etc.. @rterwedo \nHow would whole structure go? For example:\nCompany Group / Company / Department / Organization / Team / User ?\nCurrently Wekan has these roles, what new ones are required?\n- Admin (can delete)\n- User (delete will be removed, only can archive)\n- Comment Only (can only add comments to board)\n- No Comments (does not see comments and activities of board, usually some customer. Comments are discussion of expert team).. Actually, if whole structure is not known, other option is to make it possible to create and edit nested structure.. I think it would be good to have some screenshot mockups about what this should look like, for example with comparing to other Admin Panels. That way best one could be implemented.. @rterwedo\nMaybe something like this:\n```\nOrganization structure\nList of levels:\nParent\nDepartment *\nUser\nNew level name: __  [Add]\nSelected Level: Department\nList of all at this level: \nDepartment 1 \nDepartment 2\nNew Department name: ___ using [Board Group Template name (dropdown list)]\n[Create]\nSelected Department: Department 1\nPermissions:\n[_] Has Super Admin panel\n[X] Has Admin Panel\n[X] View all private boards of all users at this level\n[X] View all private boards of all users at below levels\n```. @AndyatFocallocal \nYou are the only one I have read to have such pessimistic opinion, I don't know in what kind of world you are living in.\n\nWekan is critical part of new platforms Wekan is currently being integrated to.\nWekan largest user has 13k users using Wekan in their company.\nWekan has been translated to about 49 languages.\nWekan is used in most countries of the world.\nThere is many companies and individuals contributing code to Wekan, to add features and bugfixes.\nThere have been new features and fixes added to Wekan many times a day.. - Hierarchy concerns #2186 , I do need hierarchy for my many use cases\nTabbed UI #641\n\nWekan UI is different, so maybe some of the ideas could work, but in Trello screenshots above:\n- there is too much repetition of text\n- there is Change button, better would be to show the options to show available settings directly like in Wekan\n- there is too little info shown at once at User Admin, Wekan Admin Panel does list more details about users at once\n- Add board button is at bottom. I already a long time ago moved Add board button to top left, because otherwise it's needed to scroll to bottom of long list of boards to add new board.. @JonasDralle \nOf course they were worth it, screenshots gave me idea about tabbed UI. Thanks!.

From @ehausen on January 24, 2017 21:14\nIn Trello custom fields are kind of a hack and only available per board. I'm thinking a better logic would be to define Card Types - like content types! This would very handy: Project card type, a Contact card type (for CRM purposes), etc...\nLooking at Trello... Please someone (or me later) continue\n\nUser can define custom field types\nField Name\nField type (text, number, checkbox, date, dropdown, location? card reference? list reference? link? )\n\nIs it displayed on the Card Front Badge when card not open\n\n\nIf fields are set they are listed at the top of the card\n\n\nFields should integrate with search and filters (not in trello)\n\n\n. From @tugal on January 25, 2017 15:0\nHi\ni agree @ehausen, card types would be really interesting, letting every users to customize their card... From @ehausen on January 25, 2017 15:4\nWell I was actually thinking more along the lines of defining these at team or organization level - when there will be implemented. Probably the best would be to have permission where the admin can define which roles can do what.. @tugal @jLouzado \nCan you look at Wekan forum https://discuss.wekan.io/ and search these Wekan github issues and mention them with @ github name? So we could get more info what is required? I have not used Custom Fields and didn't read description of it.. @tugal @jLouzado Please work on this together, and then submit pull request to Wekan devel branch.. @tugal @jLouzado \nCan you look is any code from this pull request useful?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/413\nIt currently has some conflicts.. @tugal \nIn that PR is adding of manHour, which is like added Custom Fields, but otherwise it's not related. If it does not have anything you need in your Custom Fields implementation, just ignore it for now.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1063 has code related to this, but there is merge errors.. @jonculver \nCurrent pull request for Custom Fields is https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1079\nIt still has merge errors.. Moved to here from #1115 \n\nAdd complexity field to card\nFiltering and sorting by complexity field. @papoola \n\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#will-my-feature-request-be-implemented\n@jLouzado \nDid you do any planning or coding for this feature, can you share those as work in progress pull request so you or somebody else can continue?. @papoola has implementing this in progress, see Roadmap. @papoola \nDoes your Custom Fields work without that checkbox field type?\nCan you submit your current version to Wekan devel branch as pull request, and add checkbox field type later?. \"This branch is 8 commits ahead, 235 commits behind wekan:devel. \"\nI hope those can be still added as clean pull request to current version, without all merges etc and release tags.. I prefer to wait @jLouzado and @mfshiu for comments and testing as I have already done 3 releases today, that's really too fast, as I need to also wait comments to this https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1352. @papoola \nWhen I tried merging your Custom Fields to newest Wekan, then when I click card on Wekan, card does not open.. @feuerball11 \nThat work by @papoola has most of the Custom Fields feature implemented, only merge conflicts need to be fixed. Anyone can help by making clean pull request of it, and help is very welcome for all Wekan issues, because it makes progress faster for all of Wekan users on all Wekan platforms when there is more contributors. I have long term plan to fix and implement everything, that's why I added it to my todo list, but I only work on one feature at a time.. @feuerball11 \nNice :+1: Checklists have changed so that Checklist Items have been moved to other \"table\" to make drag-drop sorting easier. You don't need to have any idea about code or meteor, just look at these files and make some changes, you most likely end up adding Custom Fields to Wekan :slightly_smiling_face: \nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/models/checklists.js\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/models/checklistItems.js\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/migrations.js. @feuerball11 \nYes, that's correct, checkbox CustomField wasn't built. Having all the others in Wekan is already good first step, you can add pull request. Thanks!. That Custom Fields feature was done before Received and End dates were added:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1550\nSo most likely some old code is overwriting new Received and End dates layout. You can check where it is, and take away those old overwriting changes.. Login to your GitHub account (or create new), and create fork of https://github.com/wekan/wekan to your own account:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\nThen clone your repo, copy those changed files, add and commit and push them, and then at GitHub web interface click Create Pull Request\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/. If you did clone previously https://github.com/wekan/wekan repo, you see changed files with:\ngit status. Ok, I'll try that pull request.. @feuerball11 \n\nGet newest wekan/i18n/en.i18n.json file from Wekan repo, and add to that those that are added with Custom Fields. For example, Spent Time translation that is in newest Wekan is missing.\nTry to fix lint errors, by checking with npm run lint and trying to fix with eslint --fix filename.js one file at a time, but not any files in wekan/node_modules or wekan/packages or wekan/.meteor or wekan/.build or other meteor directories. Fix only .js files at wekan/client, wekan/models, and wekan/server directories.. @feuerball11 \n\nWhen you have added, committed and pushed new changes, they will appear at pull request directly.. @feuerball11 \nFor other lint errors, google search how to fix them.. @papoola \nYou also could accept CLA at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1642. I'm currently trying to remove CLA, because not all accepted pull request have CLA accepted anyway.. @feuerball11 \nCodacy is recent addition to Wekan, fixing those would be nice.. Custom Fields is missing migrations, so when upgrading, card can not be opened, and board is turned dimmed gray. To fix this, when upgrading from old version of Wekan, database schema needs to be updated to have Custom Fields.\nCustom Fields database structure is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/models/customFields.js\nAnd migrations needs to be added to here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/migrations.js\n@feuerball11 wrote to Vanila Chat, that he is looking into this later.. @ocdtrekkie \nOk, I added original CLA back. There is only requirement for name, email, country, \"I Agree\", and corporate info. I removed requirement for postal address and phone number, I don't want that much detail.. @feuerball11 \nThanks! I'll make new Wekan release today with Custom Fields.\nImport/Export can be added later.. @papoola \nFiltering Custom Fields is already implemented by @feuerball11  and included in Wekan v0.98 that was released a moment ago. Currently @feuerball11 is working on more advanced filters.. @feuerball11\nThat style is good enough, I can change it later if there is real need.\nIn general for style, cards etc have markdown support, it would be nice to enable it for text fields, you can see code at wekan/client/components/cards/*.jade .\nColor is completely different issue. It's possible already to change board color, and later there will be ability to change card background, swimlane etc colors. Colors will be in separate settings, and not in general styling.\nMost important is to get basic functionality first, and not worry about styling. . Moved to here from #1649\nFrom @Chartman123 \nIssue\n\nWekan version: 1.00\n\nProblem description:\n- When you create a new custom field you can set the checkbox to show the field on the card. If you edit the custom field later and uncheck the box, the field doesn't disappear from the card and the checkbox is set again the next time you open the edit dialog for the custom field. Moved to here from #1650\nFrom @therampagerado\nThe new feature is great but I would like to make it little more user friendly.\nImprovements:\n1. When we specify global custom fields in the right swipe menu we have to see them for all cards in the future already available. The current way is that we have to add everyone of them to our cards manually if we need them. This takes time and is not user friendly if we need to speed things up and simplify our day-2-day activities in Wekan.\n2. I would like to see the Custom Field (CF) types already visible in my cards. So in one word I would like to remove \"edit\" button and replace it with the placeholder - text, number, dropdown, date (date can be left as is to be in conformation with the rest of dates). This will save one click per initial field edit and will be more user friendly to the customers - they will know exactly what to expect there - number, or input text or choose from the dropdown.\nAdditions:\n1. I would like to have checkboxes field where in the card I have already created checkbox. Let me explain the user case - I have 5 working stations. One order may have all of them involved or only 1. When I create card for this order I need to quickly specify which stations are involved in it. Now I have to create every checkbox manually and write it's values, name, etc. \nI would like to have already made checkbox with all possible combinations when I create a card. Then when I have only 3 stations involved I can delete the 2 that don't do work on this particular order and have the checkbox available for the working ones. That way the admin of the board can quickly give work to each station by just deleting the unnecessary options with 1-2 mouse clicks and when they are complete the checkbox field will light up green making the card ready to move to the next column.\nI can imagine the same implementation as the new custom fields so I would like to leave it here as a suggestion.\nReply from @feuerball11\nImprovement 1.: \nI could see this as an option in the creation of customFields. It depends on the usercase. If you want to have a new custom field for 1-3 cards, or just one board, and add it to all cards on all boards, you need time to remove all the custom fields. \nSo yes, as an option on the creation. \nImprovement 2: \nSounds good\nAddition 1:\nCheckboxes where planned by the original autor, i just finishd what was there. I put them on my todos, but i have deleting things from recycling bin, and a few bugfixes regarding custom fields and filter bevore that. . @therampagerado \nPlease add screenshot mockups how your checksum idea, this workflow, etc features would work.\nAnyone can also support work of @feuerball11 by adding bounty with these instructions to:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/41780463-add-feature-custom-fields. @feuerball11 \nCode: Trello Import, and Wekan Import/Export:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/models\n- import.js\n- export.js\n- trelloCreator.js\n- wekanCreator.js\n. @DejfCold \nYes it should be &&, because the example is really about using special ordering with adding brackets. Brackets are only needed if you want that Advanced Filter doing custom order, because normally F1 == V1 is executed first, because execution order is normally from left to right. But because brackets are added, those inside brackets are executed first. I will fix this in translations myself, so that others don't need to re-translate.\nUpdate 2018-06-10: I have now changed and => && in translations.. @sfahrenholz \nIf Custom Field would support Markdown in text field like at my comment above, URL could be added as markdown like this:\n[Wekan website](https://wekan.github.io)\nI have not tested yet does text field have Markdown support.. @therampagerado \nOk, then there should be new URL field type, where link name and URL can be pasted to their 2 input fields.. @therampagerado \nBecause links can be long, see #1389 \nIt easier to click on short descriptive name.. I think Details view is fine as it is currently. I did have enough trouble with removing emoji code automatic conversion, because it did break MAC addresses and other formatting. If you need http(s) or ftp link to be made clickable, you should use Custom Field for that.. Sure if someone adds pull request to implement making http(s) and ftp links etc, and it does not break anything, it's OK. Anyone can add any feature, if it does not break anything.. Docs for Custom Fields: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Custom-Fields. @nicosmaris \nMaybe this could also help https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1872#issuecomment-418356586\nThis issue is open, because not all Custom Fields features are implemented yet.\nPull requests to for fixing Custom Fields and other bugs welcome.\nFixing bugs is also on my Roadmap, when I get some free time for it.. @nicosmaris \nYes, it takes time before everything is easy point and click, and that day is coming nearer every day.. There's some setup of bountysource still going on, so please wait until I have configured it correctly.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#will-my-feature-request-be-implemented. @Creanimo \nOk it's now possible to try to add bounty to:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekan\nPlease tell me does it work Ok.. @killua-eu \nYes I (or somebody else in Wekan team) will implement those features that have bounties.\nHaving a bounty raises priority a lot.\nPlease also add description how calendar view feature should work.. I did also add Commercial Support to wiki, if somebody is interested in that:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki. @killua-eu \nIt seems that super-productivity does not have calendar yet (see issue above) but has many other nice features.\nFor calendar, there are some packages for meteor:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/packages/calendar\nFor example:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar\nhttps://fullcalendar.io\nI have not checked how many of required features it has..

Button currenly only opens small popup, it needs to be resized.\n\nTODO\n1) Create standalone demo outside Wekan to combine these fullcalendar demos:\nLOCALES:  https://fullcalendar.io/js/fullcalendar-3.4.0/demos/locales.html\nTIMEZONE: https://fullcalendar.io/js/fullcalendar-3.4.0/demos/timezones.html\nTIME RANGES: https://fullcalendar.io/js/fullcalendar-3.4.0/demos/selectable.html (possible to enlarge or shorten time range by dragging)\nGOOGLE CALENDAR: https://fullcalendar.io/js/fullcalendar-3.4.0/demos/gcal.html (create similar URLs inside Wekan what fullcalendar shows)\nEXTERNAL EVENTS: https://fullcalendar.io/js/fullcalendar-3.4.0/demos/external-dragging.html (for dragging Wekan cards to board)\n2) Create gcal/caldav URLs inside Wekan to show start and due dates.\nTechnically:\n- start and due dates are at MongoDB database\n- generate gcal/caldav URLs live, similar to displaying card changes immediately in Wekan, or change to start/duedate triggering update\n- add gcal/caldav authentication\n3) Calendar button shows screen that shows data from gcal/caldav URLs:\n\nTop: Language and timezone selection - preselected according to Wekan language (or browser setting)\nTop: Change to previous or next month\nLeft: Calendar display.\nLeft: List of those that only have start time, no due date. On calendar those could be shown as having same start time and due date, and maybe using different color.\nRight Top: Dropdowns of lists and their cards, selected card can then be dragged to calendar using external events above.\nRight Bottom: Filtering by user.\n\nFEEDBACK WELCOME\nIf anyone has improvements to this design, please add comment to this issue.. @Creanimo \nIf possible, yes. I will update this issue as I get more progress.. @Creanimo\n:D I really should try to continue this. When I have had free time for Wekan, there has been so many pull requests to test and merge, bugfixes to do, releases to do, etc so I probably forgot about this, so thanks for reminding :) . I updated roadmap :).

Where I can see deadlines of all bounties?. @Creanimo \nI need to update Roadmap order, because I need to do in this order:\n1) search\n2) copy + move cards to other boards\n3) calendar\nI don't have ETA, but I try to do more Wekan and less other work.. Note to myself of these features wishes:\n\nmodify the start and due dates directly in the calendar\nfilter the cards with selected tags or user. I reorganized Roadmap and started to think that it's probably good idea to do those first that are currently in progress, before starting anything else.. @lichtamberg \n\nI plan to have calendar feature working this year, if possible.\nAlso note that Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates will be available at January next year:\nhttps://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018.html\nThere is already plans to have it in Sandstorm, it makes using Sandstorm a lot easier.\nFor companies I recommend commercial support of Wekan Team, if you have some budget:\nhttp://www.xet7.org/wekan\nIt really helps to speed up Wekan development, encourages contributors etc.. @Creanimo \nThanks!\nThere is LDAP in Cloudron Wekan but it's not integrated yet.. @Creanimo \nFor Let's Encrypt certificates, current self-hosting Wekan alternatives are using in front of Wekan:\n- Caddy\n- Nginx with Certbot\nIf you want longer time between renewing SSL certs than 3 months, you can use free account at CloudFlare and there click Crypto/Origin Certificates/Create certificate that is used to encrypt traffic between your server's Nginx and CloudFlare.. Additional requirements, sponsored by FX:\nWhen modifying due date of a card:\n1) Show info about due date change in the activities panel\n2) Email card members about change of due date\n. @BaobabCoder has started implementing this as minimal implementation first.. Steps:\n1) @BaobabCoder makes minimal implementation of Calendar feature, and this issue is closed\n2) @BaobabCoder gets full bounty of this feature, just like @GhassenRjab got for minimal implementation of Search feature\n3) Remaining Calendar feature requests are moved to new issue. @BaobabCoder has not provided any status report, so for now, I'm moving this back to my todo list.. @BaobabCoder came back, and is now continuing Calendar :). Correction: @BaobabCoder said that he makes basic first version of calendar, adds it as pull request, and gives bounty to me, so that I can continue adding features and updates to calendar, and to support my development of Wekan, because @BaobabCoder currently has his full time job, and I only have some part-time job, doing Wekan etc. Thanks to @BaobabCoder !. Related: Calendar versioning https://calver.org. Calendar in progress at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1728. @frakman1 \nCalendar Empty is issue #1998 . This issue is closed.. @frakman1 \nCalendar View has been added to Wekan, and it did work in Wekan when it was originally added.\nCalendar being broken, or adding new feature to calendar, is a new issue. It is not related to old issue, and is not continued at old issue. Old issues are closed, when they are done.\nI do often combine and move issues. Wekan bugs will be fixed.\nSo, please continue at issue #1998 . Do not continue at this old issue.. This issue was moved to wekan/wekan#808. This issue was moved to wekan/wekan#810. Related feature request from @BaobabCoder\nInstead to see time spent on a card, see estimation of time that will be spent (in hours).\nSimilar feature is in Visual Studio Team Services:\nhttps://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/kanban/_img/filter-kb-filter-text-web.png. Maybe pomodoro timer like this at kanbanflow?\n\n. Here was this comment, but I do not see it, maybe it was removed?\n\nPersonal opinion; we're looking for a non-proprietary Kanban board to manage a team (my organization) across multiple projects. A must have it not a tomato timer (though I use then personally) nor a timer (time spent) but something simple as a standard since the BOT (beginning of time) simple time estimates and time spend (2 text boxes).. al-la Jira, TFS, Bugzilla... I'm new to Meteor but hope to look at this project over the next few weeks and looking to see if anyone would agree that something simpler would be a good first cut. I can just fork otherwise.\n\nAnybody is free to add any way to track time. If there is multiple ways, there can be menu about what to use. There is no need to fork Wekan. All contributions are welcome! :). Moved to here from #1843\nFrom @rjevnikar \nI've been asked to add touch times per-member/card. Since cards and boards now both have spentTime and isOvertime fields, I thought it might make sense to discuss and possibly re-think how this timing information is stored in the database.\nMy current thought is to split this information out into a separate collection. As it can apply to cards or boards-as-cards, I'll refer to it as a task duration.\nA task duration would have:\n- a unit of time (minute, hour, day, week, sprint, month, quarter, year) \n- a planned value\n- an actual value\n- an overtime flag\n- a rate of time (total, per day, per week, per sprint, per month, per quarter, per year)\n- a boardId\n- a cardId\n- a userId [optional]\nDoes this fit with the direction the project is going in and do you see any negatives to this approach?. @rjevnikar \nYes you can add time tracking the way you described.\nBecause there could be a lot of data added with this, it would be nice to have some cleanup options for that data too.. @dev-love \nI don't know, currently @rjevnikar is working on this, not me.. @whittssg \nWhat details?. This issue was moved to wekan/wekan#813. Moved to #466. This issue was moved to wekan/wekan#816. @kdamianakis \nIt's very likely that because of rapidly changing node.js packages those install from source instructions need fixing again. If you are in a hurry and just trying Wefork, use VirtualBox appliance at https://wekan.xet7.org. From @kdamianakis on January 25, 2017 10:48\nThank you for this - not in a hurry but would be useful to see if others have also a similar problem. I believe Wekan to be a very useful open source self hosted app.. @kdamianakis \nYes it has happened before to others that they had problems installing from source, although I for me install went fine when I created VirtualBox appliance. I have fixed those instructions multiple times before. There are also other bugfixes in progress.. @2Belette \nYou have too new version of node. Please try these instructions:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source. From @stephenmoloney on January 30, 2017 14:23\n@danielwentland \nThanks for this report... I hadn't actually tried the container yet with MAIL...\nWere you using the docker installation?.

From @stephenmoloney on January 20, 2017 14:46\nI've managed to make a wekan-alpine build in the wekan-launchpad.\nThe size is 115MB and ~80MB of this is the meteor bundle. Would be nice if it was possible to shrink that further.. 80MB bundle seems to work well enough. Closing issue.. Moved to here from #790\nFrom @ocdtrekkie \n\nI think @dwrensha pretty much detailed everything in #823 but it may just be best for him to PR that being disabled when he packages the new version. It sounds like a lot of this will be simpler after Wekan moves to a newer Meteor version.\n\nOk thanks! I'll try building .spk using these instructions.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/wiki/Building-Wekan-for-Sandstorm. @lifehome \nNo, this does not exists yet.. Using Gravatar is not compliant to EU GDPR regulation.. @zewa666 \nYes. Using Gravatar is not compliant with GDPR. Gravatar support will not be implemented in Wekan.\nSimilar issue here:\nhttps://lists.mailman3.org/archives/list/mailman-users@mailman3.org/thread/H5I7MO7Z5FN3LLEVGU4EUW6K7FNWJ2DT/. @lifehome \nGDPR affects also all other companies that do business with EU, like companies at USA. If at some other country there is not such strong privacy protections, most likely govenment can hijack those connections to gravatar, potentially inserting something malicious. So having Gravatar support is security bug.\nGravatar does not work in private intranets where is no direct internet connection, or where is some kind of proxy.  For those environments, Gravatar would not work, and even possibility of that option would make usage non-GDPR compliant. Same is with Sandstorm, Wekan is inside secure sandbox, with no access from Sandstorm sandbox to outside to Internet, if no Sandstorm-compatible way is implemented.\nWekan does not load any external resources from internet, like fonts, CSS, etc. That means Wekan is currently safe to use in company intranet use, in healthcare, etc. It's a strong guarantee, I do not want to break that.. @lifehome \nI would only accept General Avatar feature, with settings configured in environment variables, \nlike URL that can be at gravatar or local intranet server, like http://192.168.1.200/avatars/username.png, with username text replaced with Wekan username.\nThere should be no UI in Admin Panel, all should be configured in environment variables of standalone/docker/snap version.\nThis would be coded and submitted as pull request to Wekan devel branch by somebody that really wants this feature.\nFor implementing this, see Developer Documentation and Excellent example how pull requests are improved and integrated, and not needed commits removed. Moved from #887\nFrom @rvalle\nCapital letters in Username / Email. User unable to log in / reset password.\nHi!\nI somehow run into a path in which users could neither log on / request a new password.\nI believe I invited new users to a board, and users accepted via email creating a new account.\nI believe users were able to interact with the system as they kept their session open for some weeks.\nLater when the session, for whatever reason, expired they could not log on the system / request new password.\nLooking in the database I found the user with first letter in username and email capitalized, like User, Email@domain.com.\nThere seems to be an usability problem here. The log in form will convert email to lowercase, but the invitation form will accept a capitalized email. Probably any of the browsers autocapitalized the fields as they were edited.. @centigrade-thomas-becker \nDoes this still happen on newest Wekan?. You can use REST API:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1037\nFor layouts, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/781. @phillc73 \nCan you convert that Taskwarrior JSON export file to be same format as Trello JSON export file, that Wekan can already import?. @phillc73 \nYes, please do:\n\nCreate some board at Trello\nExport board to .json file\nLook at the structure, what it would take to convert it with some tool or code.\n\nI have not used Taskwarrior.. @phillc73 \nI think it's better to only look at git history with GUI like gitk, and see how import from Trello was implemented. Then modify it to create Import from Taskwarrior menu option for Wekan, and import Taskwarrior file directly without modifications. This is because Trello import option is most likely hardcoded for Trello file format and API.. @jLouzado \nHow this would work with Custom Fields feature you are developing currently?. @jLouzado \nYou can continue working on Custom Fields etc.\nI'll think what it would take to implement Taskwarrior import.. @GuillaumeAmat @jLouzado \nI will cleanup issues myself. Just let it be as it is now.. Duplicate of https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/640#issuecomment-279131179\nThis is also on Wekan roadmap board in \"Wishes to mquandalle\"\nClosing issue.. @weaktyper \nIf you originally installed using commands alone like this:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo:3.2.11\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:latest\n```\nIf you have newer mongo version, you need backup your MongoDB data:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nand use similar commands as below to replace you mongo container with version 3.2.11, and then restore data.\nThen you can upgrade just only the Wekan container this way:\nShow docker containers:\ndocker ps\nStop mquandalle/wekan container:\ndocker stop CONTAINER-ID-HERE\nRemove mquandalle/wekan container:\ndocker rm CONTAINER-ID-HERE\nRemove mquandalle/wekan image:\ndocker rmi mquandalle/wekan:latest\nRun latest version:\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080\" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:latest\n@jLouzado Can you update this documentation to wiki?\n@weaktyper Can you update docker compose documentation to wiki if something needs to be changed for this?. Thanks @jLouzado ! I made some updates to that wiki page.. Issues related to Wekan cleanup Python script can be continued at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-cleanup\nThis issue is about deleting board in Wekan.\n. If somebody wants this feature, add more to this bounty:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/41924320-add-feature-delete-wekan-board\nInstructions:\nhttp://www.xet7.org/wekan. @rjevnikar \nI don't know why delete board from recycle bin does not work anymore.. @rjevnikar \nYou can add PR. I will look how to add confirming popup, or alternatively warning text that there is no confirming popup.. I fixed Delete Board at 534b20fedac9162d2d316bd74eff743d636f2b3d and it has working confirmation popup at Wekan v1.38 https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md . Please wait for newest Wekan version to build and be available.. Selecting Finnish on login screen seems to work now.. @fmonthel \nWhen I looked at Wekan code, some of those indexes @maulal mentioned have already been added. Can you add missing ones as pull request to devel branch?. @maulal \nThanks! Just recursive grep the code for word \"ensureIndex\" to see where it's set.. Docker has volumes for persistent storage.. @maulal \nEasy to test and deploy. Wekan was already using MongoDB in Docker when I came to project.\nPlan is to add more deployment options.\nThere is already Wekan sharding in Docker to both MongoDB and ToroDB => PostgreSQL on:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-postgresql\nI probably try also using:\n- Wekan <=> ToroDB => PostgreSQL\n- Wekan <=> ToroDB server replication\n- Wekan <=> ToroDB => CochroachDB (instead of PostgreSQL, if it's useful)\nAlso on Joyent Triton there is datacenter full of Docker containers that can be resized without downtime in both RAM, CPU and disk space usage.\nhttps://www.joyent.com/triton. @johnleeming \nI have merged EN_GB, you can test it for example at Docker:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms#docker\nDoes it work for you now?. This seems to work for me, so en-GB is DD/MM/YYYY and en-US is MM/DD/YYYY.\nDate format is language and country specific. Request new language in transifex if some is missing.. @saschafoerster \nI tried, and these did work for me in different English time formats. \nEnglish\nDate: 10/23/2017\nTime: 2:00 PM\nEnglish (UK)\nDate: 23/10/2017\nTime: 14:00\nDid you get any error messages? Or how it did not work?. @BjoernLudwigPTB \nThis issue is continued at #1176. @phillc73 \nNo. I sometimes move same named lists from different boards to same board, to combine those lists.. Oh, yes that's true.\nReopening issue.. @kirantpatil \nYou can download newest precompiled binary release .tar.gz file:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nThen in that unarchived directory run command:\nmeteor\nOr any other way that you used to start Wekan previously.\nDoes this work for you?.

On elsewhere in code there is Javascript code like:\nif (!isSandstorm) {\n...\n}\nAnd in templates:\nunless isMiniScreen\n  unless isSandstorm\n. @ocdtrekkie \nDiscussion moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/790\n. @eemeli \nI got some errors when doing local Docker build with this:\n```\n\nfibers@1.0.15 install /usr/lib/node_modules/fibers\nnode build.js || nodejs build.js\n\ngyp WARN EACCES user \"undefined\" does not have permission to access the dev dir\n \"/root/.node-gyp/0.10.48\"\ngyp WARN EACCES attempting to reinstall using temporary dev dir\n \"/usr/lib/node_modules/fibers/.node-gyp\"\nmake: Entering directory /usr/lib/node_modules/fibers/build'\n  CXX(target) Release/obj.target/fibers/src/fibers.o\n  CXX(target) Release/obj.target/fibers/src/coroutine.o\n  CC(target) Release/obj.target/fibers/src/libcoro/coro.o\n  SOLINK_MODULE(target) Release/obj.target/fibers.node\n  COPY Release/fibers.node\nmake: Leaving directory/usr/lib/node_modules/fibers/build'\nInstalled in /usr/lib/node_modules/fibers/bin/linux-x64-11/fibers.node\n/usr/lib\n`-- fibers@1.0.15 \n% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  7786    0  7786    0     0  13726      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 20986\nStarting meteor 1.3.5.1 installation...   \nDownloading Meteor distribution\nMeteor 1.3.5.1 has been installed in your home directory (~/.meteor).\nNow you need to do one of the following:\n(1) Add \"$HOME/.meteor\" to your path, or\n  (2) Run this command as root:\n        cp \"/home/wekan/.meteor/packages/meteor-tool/1.3.5_1/mt-os.linux.x86_64/scripts/admin/launch-meteor\" /usr/bin/meteor\nThen to get started, take a look at 'meteor --help' or see the docs at\ndocs.meteor.com.\n ---> 8aa0855c888d\nRemoving intermediate container c3b59c2b68e5\nStep 16/20 : COPY ${SRC_PATH} /home/wekan/app\n ---> 148d32c923ea\nRemoving intermediate container 2860bff58512\nStep 17/20 : RUN chown wekan:wekan --recursive /home/wekan/app &&\n     cd /home/wekan/app &&\n     gosu wekan /home/wekan/.meteor/meteor npm install --save xss &&\n     gosu wekan /home/wekan/.meteor/meteor build --directory /home/wekan/app_build &&\n     cd /home/wekan/app_build/bundle/programs/server/ &&     gosu wekan npm install &&\n     mv /home/wekan/app_build/bundle /build &&\n         apt-get remove --purge -y ${BUILD_DEPS} &&\n     apt-get autoremove -y &&\n     rm -R /var/lib/apt/lists/* &&\n     rm -R /home/wekan/.meteor &&\n     rm -R /home/wekan/app &&\n     rm -R /home/wekan/app_build &&\n     rm /home/wekan/install_meteor.sh\n ---> Running in ea02a0b5855c\nnpm ERR!

On some platforms like Sandstorm where Wekan code is signed and read-only, it's not possible to run separate migration scripts.. @GhassenRjab \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/22237609/adding-to-someone-else-s-pull-request-on-a-github-project-that-i-do-not-own. @dejIO\nThere could be some open or closed pull request or GitHub issue that also has some drag and drop for labels (or some other drag and drop) already implemented, but somebody would need to find it and add info to this issue.\nThere are some drag-and-drop features in Wekan elsewhere like when dragging cards in a list.. Moved to here from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1215 \nNoticed by @ocdtrekkie\n\nQuirks:\n\nSomehow I managed to overwrite a checklist item by dragging and lost a couple that way while rapidly playing with this.\nYou cannot drag into a checklist that has no existing items. So, if you have two lists, you can be dragging around, drag them all into one list, and before you are able to drag them back into the other list, you have to manually add an item to that list so dragging works again.\n\n\ncc @frmwrk123. Moved to here from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1215#issuecomment-329415525\nFrom @max-marschall\n\nThe following I actually see (came from 0.37 to 0.38 dockerhub-image):\n\nExtend existing checklists (before upgrade): Not possible\nMove checklist-entries from one to another checklist (existing checklist before upgrade): Items are lost immediately\n\n= does not happen with checklists created after the upgrade\n\ncc @frmwrk123 . @frmwrk123 \nI did test manually with a small checklist. There is no automated testing yet, because nobody has contributed those tests yet. If pull requests look like they work, don't have lint errors, and don't crash Wekan, they go to new release soon. Then somebody finds problems, creates issue about it, problem is fixed by somebody in pull request. It's always possible to download previous version of Wekan if newest has problems.. @frmwrk123 \nAlso in Open Source project, if somebody does not have time, or does not know how to fix, then usually somebody else thinks it's important and spends the time to fix that bug. So do not take anything personally or take any pressure about this. It's just code.. @ocdtrekkie\n@GhassenRjab is working on this. Please continue to hold Sandstorm release.. @GhassenRjab \nChecklist items now are not lost, but:\n1) When moving Checklist item, item loses it's state that it is checkmarked.\n2) In run-wekan.sh script when running Wekan, there's messages to console about migrations. Are they necessary, could they be removed?\n```\n./run-wekan.sh\n\nStarting add-sort-checklists migration.\nFinishing add-sort-checklists migration.\n```. Related fix: Keep state of checklist items when moved cross checklists\n\n@ocdtrekkie \nPlease test new Wekan version v0.40 and it's fixes, in my tests it did not lose data. If v0.40 works for you too, you can release it to official Sandstorm App Market.. For Trello compatibility, it would be good to be able to import markdown from Trello and use it in Wekan.. Moved to #926. You can use REST API:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1037. @eemeli \nThanks, this is very welcome!\nI created this repo and invited you with direct commit access, please add your files etc there:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-dev. @eemeli \nThanks! I added it to changelog, readme and wiki:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Developer-Documentation. @mmikeww \nWekan roadmap is read-only and not editable for non-loggedin users. Please install Docker version locally and test on local WLAN.\nThere has been some other reports that Wekan works on Android browser. I have not tested yet.. Moved to #953. @entrptaher\nHow did you get fibers compiled?. @sinasalek \nwekan-0.11.1-rc1.tar.gz has been compiled on Linux, I think it does not directly work on Windows.\nI'll try to compile Windows version and see if those could be combined, or have Windows\nversion in .zip file.. @emahuni \nAt #1088 somebody already got Wekan running on Windows by installing from source as related git submodule bug got fixed recently, more details about Windows support at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms#source-on-windows\nSo this mainly requires somebody testing is it possible to create standalone Windows package and add related info to wiki. Then I could make releases also as standalone program on Windows.. Moved to here from #447\n@abdulquadir202 \nAFAIK newest Docker for Windows and Mac include Docker Compose, and they should be also able to run Linux containers with this docker-compose.yml:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nThere has been a lot of Wekan upgrades like Meteor 1.6.0.1 etc that can be seen from Dockerfile:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile\nAnyone having newest Docker for Windows, please test these with Linux and Windows versions of dependencies, and add results about your tests to this issue. Thanks!. @sinasalek \nYes, you can convert this bash file to bat file, and run with only node:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/start-wekan.sh. I added some beginning of build scripts here, but did run out of time, please try to add more to them as PRs. They are not finished yet.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/rebuild-wekan.bat\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/start-wekan.bat. Moved to #710. @johnsheleg \nWhat language requires this?\nIs that language already translated at Transifex?\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan. @sinasalek \nIt would be nice if someone could translate fully those languages.\nI can try adding this BIDI support to Wekan.. Moved to #200. Moved to #825. @tenetor3 \nTranslations are not accepted as pull request, please use Transifex:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/\nOnly changes to English are accepted as part of new features.. This already exists.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#webhooks. @fmonthel \nDepends when Sandstorm gets grain-level encryption working. Then only those that have permissions to Wekan board are able to open it, and it's encrypted at rest.. @fmonthel \nAnother option would be to figure out how to store Wekan data in ZeroDB:\nhttps://opensource.zerodb.com/. @amadilsons\nIf you have any progress, please add info to this issue.\nSandstorm\n1) Find where in https://sandstorm.io dev mailinglist, GitHub issues, and code repos is current status of encrypted grains progress.\n2) Try to make encrypted grains work on Sandstorm.\nStandalone Wekan\n1) Install ZeroDB and Wekan locally.\n2) Try to write some code that saves data to ZeroDB, and read data from there.\n3) Look at possible ways for Wekan to save data to ZeroDB, look at discussion about other databases #787 . One possibility would be to have:  Wekan <=> MongoDB driver to ZeroDB converter <=> ZeroDB database\n4) If you get Wekan working with ZeroDB, you could install ZeroDB to any server use it remotely with locally installed Wekan, and server admin would not have access to data.\nAPI time limited tokens\nIf you don't want to use always same passwords when using API etc, but have limited time tokens, look at HashiCorp Vault.. Start/Due times is already implemented with input of time with keyboard as numbers. Time is also formatted using selected language settings. Using this kind of visual selection could have more accessibility problems.. @Sohalt \nWould this cause problems in some languages that probably don't use Arabic numerals?. @Sohalt \nHow to make enforcing work on all languages, including Chinese, Japanese etc?. For example:\n\nAnd also order or date, month and year changes by language settings.\nIs there some pre-made node package for this?. Moved to #2011. @mgiacomoli \nWhat patch code did you use?. @lkisme \nDo you know how to fix this?. Fixed in today's Wekan release v0.13.. @lkisme \nDo you know how to fix this?. Fixed in today's Wekan release v0.13.. Yes. Read changelog on github repo for instructions, and github wiki docker mongodb backup page how to make change to mongodb inside docker.. @jujes \nDoes this also happen on today's Wekan release v0.13 ?. @jujes \nENOTFOUND usually means that there is already node running when you are starting another node.\nAnyway, this looks similar to bug that was fixed in v0.13, so I'm closing this issue.. @souch \nsudo is not needed for every command. I added those back that are needed. I'm not the only one contributing to wiki, some would like that installing would work without sudo, but it's not possible yet.. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/784. @whodafly\nCan you try to fix this?. @GhassenRjab \nDo you have time to look at this?. Moved to here from #1416\nFrom @fbatschi \nFeature Request: Add a new checkbox to the \"Copy card\"  dialog which lets you decide whether you want to have the potential  checklist items in the same state as they currently are, or whether they  should be unchecked. Background: I have cards with many checklist items. Once I am done with all the  items, I need to copy the card with the same content for the next month.  Currently it copies the card exactly as it is right now, meaning all  checked items are also checked in the new card. Would be great to have a  real \"fresh\" card without any checked items.. This Checklist Template feature https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1470  is included in today's Wekan release v0.75 . You can create checklist and copy it to many cards to same or another board in Standalone Wekan. You generally export and import board that has checklists, there is no export/import for only checklist yet.. Reopening, because there is not yet import/export of checklists.. @shaygover \nAddition: I do pull translations from Transifex often, and they are immediately available to install using automated Docker builds, and any platform that installs directly from source.. \u00a0@lkisme \nCan you check this?. In some issue was comment that ROOT_URL is not in use anymore, only setting in Admin Panel works. I have not tested it.. @nztqa \nDoes this need some fix? Or can this be closed?. Environment variables are documented at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#run-wekan-manually-if-youve-built-for-production\nIf you watnt port 8080, you need to change it at line 2 and 4:\nexport MONGO_URL='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/admin'\nexport ROOT_URL='http://localhost:8080'\nexport MAIL_URL='smtp://user:pass@mailserver.example.com:25/'\nexport PORT=8080. Install todays release v0.19, it has been built on Ubuntu 14.04.. Added at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/862ce27eb935c3f1a0a0af18e484c0f18dcbef5b\nWill be included in release v0.14.\nClosing issue.. @immertroll \nYes, docker latest tag includes this change. And source install. See changelog for changes.\nThere is not tag numbers yet on Docker Hub, I'll try to contact @mquandalle to get access there so I can add tags.\nLatests tag includes all latest changes from GitHub repo. It's rebuild after every new commit.. @gil0109 \nWhen I look at /sign-in webpage source, there is this:\n<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\nAFAIK this if for all Wekan webpages.\nIs there something that does not work?. @lkisme \nCan you try to fix this?. Fixed at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/943. @lkisme \nDo you have idea how to fix this?. @HLFH \nTry to cleanup database:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-cleanup. @HLFH \nIf mongodump and mongorestore --drop still works for you, database is not corrupted, there just is some extra data at database.. @mendipankaj \nWhat platform?

Previously font was changed with this pull request: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/707 . Is there better font, or should it be just possible to change it in UI ?\nTranslation files are here, are there wrong characters?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/i18n\nYou can change those at Transifex:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/\nOnly changes to English are accepted as pull request, when adding features.. Hi,\nI don't know Chinese or Japanese, only English and Finnish :)\nOk, it seems that there needs to be global setting in Admin Panel for global font, and board setting for override it to have different font in specific board.. @mo-han \nYou can see what font was changed in that pull request. Just do recursive search on source wekan source code repo you clone to your computer. In Wekan GitHub wiki in instructions how to build from source.. @mo-han \nWhat common font shows all languages correctly? I can change to use that easily, and make new release of Wekan, if I get to know correct font name.. Ok, then we need settings for global and per board font.. @mo-han\nWell, try it with Golang, editing binary :D. Related font adjustments:\nRoboto \u2026 CONDENSED\nRoboto Light Condensed  (or even Thin, we need to look at) \n\nCondensed Standard (everything which is not mentioned below)\n\n\nRoboto Bold Condensed (or Medium, if the standard becomes Thin)\n\nlist titles (but not card titles)\ntitles on the cards (f.e. Checklists)\nMarkdown bold: \n\n\nRoboto Bold Condensed PLUS color (f.e. Wekan blue?)\n\naddressees @name\n\n\nRoboto  Condensed\n\nall fonts that are grey now. Does Meteor / Node.js have support for virtual hosts, redirects, let's encrypt etc? URL?. That force-ssl seems to just redirect. Does somebody use only Node.js in production?\n\nIn all articles I found with Google search, Nginx/Caddy/some other webserver is used for load balancing and delivering static content in front of Node.js.. @supercrypt\nDoes that http-proxy include support for SSL ?\nOtherwise, if it requires separate install of stunnel, it's the same as using Nginx/Caddy etc in front of Wekan.. @supercrypt \nIs stunnel included inside http-proxy npm package? So there is no need for stunnel setup separately?. @patrickdung \nHaving Nginx/Apache/Caddy/Stunnel/Traefik to provide SSL in front of Wekan is already possible.\nThis issue is only about having SSL in Wekan's node.js server itself.. This is already fixed.. @petrk94 \nInstalling from source:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source\nAlternatives:\n1) Use Docker install\n2) Help with, or wait for newer version port: https://github.com/datamaker/wekan\nWould this work for you?. For somebody implementing this, there is already related features for:\n\nprivate / public boards\nfilters\nlabels\nhiding system messages.\n\nLook at git history with GUI like gitk to see how those are implemented. It's just mainly looking at the code and figure out how to combine them.\nSubmit pull request to devel branch. Thanks! :). Moved to #910. @khba \nDoes this also happen on newest Meteor 1.4 Docker image?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms. Fixed.\nWiki is freely editable by any GitHub user, and documentation contributions are very welcome, so in future you or anybody else can fix those directly to wiki. No need to create new issue.\nClosing issue.. @NoodleBB\nPlease don't include your username and password in GitHub issues, and please change them. I removed them from your post above.\nIs this same as #910 ? That has ATCreateUserServer error too.. Ok, we'll keep it separate.. @NoodleBB \nOk I'm able to duplicate this issue.\n1) I think this is because there's some problem in sending registration email to first one that registers account to Wekan.\n2) Although it gives this error, new user account is created anyway, and it's possible to login as that new just created user. It's possible to register also with invalid email address, it's not mandatory to have working SMTP server.\n3) Another related issue could be that usually registering and logging in works in some languages like English etc, but no all, because of missing translations of login screen. I have not checked what is current status of different languages.. @NoodleBB \nTry this:\n1) Register user account, if you have not registered yet. Ignore any errors it shows.\n2) Reload Wekan webpage and login.\n3) Enable admin interface by adding your username as admin to MongoDB:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v0111-rc2-2017-03-05-wekan-prerelease\nSome of this MongoDB command examples can be useful:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\n4) Reload Wekan webpage, you should see Admin Panel in menu.\n5) Setup your SMTP etc settings in Admin Panel and save.\n. @NoodleBB \nAre you installing precompiled build from Wekan releases page?\nHave you enabled websockets? Wekan needs them.\nI'll try installing to uberspace.de later and try to provide instructions to wiki.. @NoodleBB \nThanks! Please add your install notes to Wekan GitHub wiki. I will try your install notes and update wiki when I get Wekan to work at uberspace.de.. @rhelsing \nWhen testing this, I get errors:\nat Document.addMember (packages/mquandalle:collection-mutations/mutations.js:8:20)\n    at [object Object].inviteUserToBoard (models/users.js:379:13)\n    at packages/check/match.js:107:1\n    at [object Object]._.extend.withValue (packages/meteor/dynamics_nodejs.js:56:1)\n    at Object.exports.Match._failIfArgumentsAreNotAllChecked (packages/check/match.js:106:1)\n    at maybeAuditArgumentChecks (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:1708:18)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:711:19\n    at [object Object]._.extend.withValue (packages/meteor/dynamics_nodejs.js:56:1)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:709:40\n    at [object Object]._.extend.withValue (packages/meteor/dynamics_nodejs.js:56:1)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:707:46\n    at tryCallTwo (/home/user/repos/wekan/.build/bundle/programs/server/npm/node_modules/meteor/promise/node_modules/promise/lib/core.js:45:5)\n    at doResolve (/home/user/repos/wekan/.build/bundle/programs/server/npm/node_modules/meteor/promise/node_modules/promise/lib/core.js:200:13)\nSanitized and reported to the client as: Is comment only is required [400]. @rhelsing \nAt runtime, when using Wekan. I will try again, I don't know is this related to Comment permission or some other code.. @rhelsing \nHow this works? Where do I set comment permissions for user? Can you add screenshots?. This would be nice, so in card titles and list titles there could be editable markdown similarly like at card description fields.. Also board title and title's description could allow markdown.\nI'm just thinking that does this work, so if those contain only markdown link, is it still possible to both:\n1) click link\n2) edit titles. @HLFH \nYes, there's also other great features and bugfixes, I'm just adding most of them before making a release.. Translations are accepted only at https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/ , not as pull request.\nOnly source English language changes are accepted as pull request when adding new features.\nThanks!. I'm not able to add tags, because I don't yet have access to Docker Hub of Wekan. You can always get latest version using tag \"latest\" as in docker install instructions, it's automatically built after every commit to repo. I'll try to contact @mquandalle sometime. More tasks to @mquandalle is at Wekan roadmap board that is linked on readme. . @rubberduck203 \nI have already sent support request to Docker Hub about adding tags, and also have direct contact to @mquandalle that has full access. Please be patient, it's taken care of. No need to open issues. :). @rubberduck203 \nI have sent message to @mquandalle that he adds tags to Docker Hub.\nI don't know why some panic here, I try to be as friendly and welcoming as possible :). @rubberduck203 \nI'm currently creating new automated build with all tags to:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/wekanteam/wekan/\nOnce it has built all tags, I will change all urls to point to there.. @rubberduck203 \nHow did you add docker tags to docker hub? on wekanteam/wekan my v0.16 and v0.17 builds fail and yours work.. @stephenmoloney \nCan you look why Docker Hub builds give errors?\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/mquandalle/wekan/\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/wekanteam/wekan/\n. @stephenmoloney \nBuild fails on dockerhub. I have not tried to build locally yet. I use Xubuntu 16.04 64bit for development. Could it be debian issue?\n@rubberduck203 \nDo you somehow push dockerhub tags back to dockerhub ?. @stephenmoloney \nWhen building Wekan I got this error:\n/home/user/repos/meteor/.meteor/isopackets/ddp/npm/node_modules/meteor/promise/node_modules/meteor-promise/promise_server.js:165\n      throw error;\n            ^\nError: ENOSPC, write\n./rebuild-wekan.sh: line 20: cd: .build/bundle/programs/server: File or directory does not exist\nI'll try to figure out why this happens.\nPreviously I did change used Dockerfile npm version to the one I use, but I'm not sure are there differences when I build on Xubuntu 16.04 64bit and that Debian wheezy that Docker image is based on.. Could be related to:\nhttps://github.com/onmodulus/docker-build-meteor/issues/29. Doh, that error in building Wekan was only because I had full harddisk :) \nNow Wekan builds and works fine :)\nBut I don't know about that Docker Hub error yet.. Although some contributors have made all of meteor-1.4 branch running on Docker possible, I have not been able to replicate meteor-1.4 branch working outside Docker yet with installing from source, as seen at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1010#issuecomment-297735373\nWhen some contributor helps me with that and documenting those steps to wiki, it's much easier for me to continue testing and accepting pull requests, and move meteor-1.4 branch to devel and master branches, so I can then continue making new releases.. - I built meteor-1.4 branch and merged it to devel and master\n- I merged some pull requests, and translation updates.\n- I updated install from source instructions:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source. Today I have released Wekan v0.19, it's been build successfully and tagged at:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/wekanteam/wekan/tags/\nSome other tags have also been successfully built at:\nhttps://quay.io/repository/wekan/wekan?tab=tags\nFor example:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo:3.2.13\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080\" -p 8080:80 quay.io/wekan/wekan:v0.19\n```. Moved to #794. Does not happen to me on:\n\n\nLinux Chrome 57.0.2987.110 (64-bit)\n\n\nEdge 38.14393.0.0. Does not happen to me on:\n\n\nLinux Chrome 57.0.2987.110 (64-bit)\n\n\nEdge 38.14393.0.0. Ok, with new steps now I can reproduce on Edge, but not on Linux Chrome.. Does not happen on Windows Chrome.\n\n\nOn Edge, I can not change Wekan language to Finnish. It stays English. I have Finnish Windows and Edge browser menus are also in Finnish.\nOn Windows Chrome, Wekan language can be changed to Finnish.. @ravip \nI tested this at Azure Ubuntu 18.04 Wekan snap.\nFirefox inspect console does not support http/2 , this can be seen as wss errors in Firefox console. Possibility to turn of http/2 was added to Caddy at 2017 https://github.com/mholt/caddy/issues/189#issuecomment-280879901\nChrome console does support http/2, so there is no errors.\nExample of turning http/2 off in Caddyfile:\nwekan.example.com {\n    tls {\n        alpn http/1.1\n    }\n    proxy / localhost:3001 {\n      websocket\n      transparent\n    }\n}\nI will add this to Wekan Caddy examples.\nApache websocket config example was recently fixed with correct websocket examples:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Apache\nI have not tried are Nginx config examples up-to-date yet.\nPlease try does this help.. @neooleg \nYes, please add all details to issues what is required, how it should work etc.. @outdoorWI \nDoes attachment filename contain special characters?\nWhat MongoDB version are you running?. @outdoorWI \nWekan crashes with MongoDB 3.4.x, it's known issue.\nUse MongoDB 3.2.x, like in this Docker Compose file:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nThis will probably be fixed by @datamaker when Meteror 1.4 port is complete:\nhttps://github.com/datamaker/wekan. Moved to #904. @Neibaf94 \nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/936#issuecomment-289113367. @schneivo77 \nFixes for internal server error etc email bugs are merged, so source install works.\nDocker builds are currently being actively fixed, and we are adding tags to Docker Hub in near future.. @stephenmoloney \nYes Docker build was already broken :D \nWhen it gets fixed correctly then I'll make new release.. @vampirefrog \nDoes Admin Panel not work for you for setting email options? See Wekan GitHub project readme.. @vampirefrog \nI changed issue topic for adding SMTP test to Admin Panel, so disk is not filled with logs.. Ok, seems that this is not possible currently because of Meteor.. Merged. Will be included in next release.. Improving viewing attachments on mobile at #201. @memeplex \nOn mobile Chrome, removing browser bar is not possible.\nOn mobile Firefox, browser bar etc can be removed with addon:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/fullscreen-mobile/\n1) Install addon from Firefox Addons menu\n2) On Firefox menu at bottom, click \"Full screen\"\n3) When you want to get browser from Full screen, hold long finger on screen on Wekan empty area, and click \"Exit Full Screen\".\nOn my Android phone it looks like this using Sandstorm Wekan. On Standalone Wekan, there is no black bar on top.\n\n. Please test after I have released Wekan v0.60 (or newer) how this has been improved by  @floatinghotpot and @nztqa , for me it seems that back arrow does work on desktop but I had some problems clicking it on Android.. Moved from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/458 to here:\nFrom @lichtamberg\nI have following 3 issues on my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with latest Chrome):\n1) its really hard to click on the row names (board titles), most of the time it doesn't work and no click/touch event happens (independent if I click on the title or the arrow on the right). It also doesn't work with the Galaxy S Pen, so it's not related about my fingers :) \n2) Sometimes it starts the swap-rows feature, even if my click was just a \"press\" - not a drag and drop (maybe it's better to remove/deactivate the swap card-titles feature in general on phones?) \n3) When I achieve to reach a cards page, when I press the back button - I don't go to the cards index page back, but to the general board selection page.. @biji \n1) Click card\n2) On right side of card name, click 3 lines \"Hamburger\" menu\n3) Scroll down and click \"Move Card\" or \"Copy Card\"\n4) (Scroll up if needed and) Select to what board and list you want to copy or move card\nYou can copy or move card to list on the same or another board.. @shred \nMobile Web improvements are planned for sometime 2018:\nhttps://blog.wekan.team/2017/12/2-years-of-wekan-what-we-archieved/index.html. ## Update 2019-01-01\nCurrently mobile mode works mostly.\nMissing are these:\n\n[x] Move home button / avatar bar from bottom to top. So at top first is home button / avatar, then others.\n[x] When clicing Move Card, go to correct page position. Currently it's at empty page position, and there is need to scroll page up to see Move Card options. It should work similarly like Copy Card, that is visible.\n[x] Also check that other buttons go to visible page.\n[ ] Create toggle/switch to top of page that toggles/switches between mobile and full screen mode. This is needed, because keeping full screen mode does not work in all mobile browsers. On All Boards page star would be at left side of \"My Boards\" text. On mobile mode at board view at left side of star (bookmark icon) would be desktop icon and on desktop mode board view at left side of star would be mobile icon. It would save mobile/desktop mode similar like hide system messages slider on card.\n[ ] Try to get Swimlane mode working better on mobile mode.. Moved to #788. @76house @brylie \n\nPlease ignore all trolls, spammers, downvotes etc in our issues, and discussion about those. All feature requests are considered good and can be implemented by those that wish to do so.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ. Someone could look how swimlanes is implemented at Kanboard to get some ideas or use same libraries. Both Wekan and Kanboard use MIT license.. @jadbox \nThere is no bounties for this feature. More info about bounties here.\nAt old roadmap and new roadmap lists planned and in progress it seems that nobody is working on this feature.\nThis does not seem to be so important to have in near future.. I did try that code. Suggestions:\n- Fix lint errors. Warnings are OK, they don't need to be fixed.\n- Layout change on board menu: horizontal/vertical/swimlane (vertical later), saved to board settings like board color, so it changes layout for all board members. If there are better official names for those, like horizontal=kanban and vertical=something else, then suggestions welcome.\nThat offtopic vertical layout is mentioned at separate themes issue and looks similar like this Jira screenshot middle column. Vertical layout can be looked at later.\n\nComments, anybody?. Reminder to myself:\n- Check my notes about other swimlanes functionality wishes I did get previously, add to here. Optional, maybe later additions. These partially are related to filtering.\nAbility to hide:\n- row\n- column\n- cards that have some label\n- some users\n- show only my own cards\nThese would need some logical UI design.. Today's release v0.65 includes Swimlanes part 1, please test Docker image at Quay.io:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases. BTW, @andresmanelli is doing excellent work with adding swimlanes, adding features, fixing bugs etc. I really recommend all users of swimlanes feature to add to bounty at https://www.bountysource.com/issues/43611228-add-feature-swimlanes-rows because there is none yet, and feature request list just keeps growing. More info about bounties at https://wekan.team .\n@rzoss \nWekan does not have any separate development and stable releases. There is only newest release, which currently is v0.70. We rely on Wekan users to add GitHub issues about bugs and feature requests.\nI don't know what you mean by attributes to Swimline. Wekan cards already have:\n- Markdown for card text, formatting, links, etc\n- Responsible members can be added to cards\n- Spent time/Overtime\n- Start Date\n- Due Date\n- Gogs integration, similar workflows could be used https://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs\nWekan will sometime also have\n- Custom Fields, it's not finished or merged yet #807\n- LDAP #119 , it's not finished or merged yet\n- Calendar, so Start/Due dates can be seen on calendar, and dragged around #808 \nSo I don't know are you asking something that does not exist yet. Please add more details, screenshot mockups etc about what you would like to have.. @naveengh \nYes, swimlanes is included in latest Wekan release.. @andresmanelli \nThanks for update! I added it to Roadmap https://github.com/wekan/wekan/projects/2\nPlease do what is most important to you, there are other contributors that can look at those issues. Do not take any pressure about Wekan contributions, afaik you did not have any bounties yet, so we are just grateful what you did already. There is no requirement to spend additional time.. Swimlanes is already in Wekan.. @brylie \nWould this prevent viewing public boards?. @brylie\nWhat commands you used to build this with meteor 1.4 ?. @stephenmoloney \nBackup your MongoDB 3.2.x and try upgrading to newer version:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nI presume newer Meteor 1.4 supports newest MongoDB 3.4.x.\nBut after upgrade, if uploading images to Wekan crashes Wekan, you need to to go back to newest MongoDB 3.2.x.\nI have not had time to try Meteor 1.4. stuff yet.. @HLFH \nNewest 4.x I think.. I have moved devel back to Meteor 1.3.\nMeteor 1.4 work continues in meteor-1.4 branch.. @NoodleBB \nHave you checked webserver config examples at Wekan GitHub wiki? If some examples is missing, I need to add them. The examples should work now that double slash bug is already fixed.. @NoodleBB \nNginx config in front of Wekan is for https://example.com/wekan \nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config\nCaddy webserver config too:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Caddy-Webserver-Config\nIn Wekan config:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-a-wekan-release\nYou need real correct URL to Wekan so it knows where it really is:\nexport ROOT_URL='https://example.com/wekan'\nAlthought Wekan runs in port 8080 or other:\nexport PORT=8080\nThen with UFW firewall you only allow port 80 and 443, and others you could need like SSH.\nNginx or Caddy proxies to localhost Wekan.. @NoodleBB \nYou can freely edit wiki and make structure more logical.. @NoodleBB \nAlso logical index of pages on Wiki homepage would be very useful.. I have moved that starting point of documentation to wiki:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail\nIt can be continued there.. @NoodleBB \nWhat Wekan version are you using? This is already fixed https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/932. @Serubin \nCan you look at this?. @NoodleBB \nReleases get old quickly. I do tests and merges on devel head.. @NoodleBB \nHmm, maybe I'll check it sometime.. Moved to #969. @NoodleBB \nWe don't have any unit tests.. @NoodleBB \nI moved your issue back to here.\nWe could have some checks and error messages for this.. @NoodleBB \nDoh, it seems to be my problem. I did not update submodules for releases. I will update releases later.. @NoodleBB \nThere could be some tests somewhere, but I have not tried to find them yet. Usually I just build Wekan and test does it work or does it crash. I keep Wekan devel head working.\nTravis and Docker builds have some tests, but they are broken. I can build Wekan and it works great though.. @NoodleBB \nI updated release v0.18 to include submodules. Can you test does that .tar.gz work for you now?. Great! :). Including submodules leads to bug, so language cannot be changed anymore.\nI need to regenerate releases without submodules.. Ok I made a script that regenerated all tar.gz releases and uploaded them.. I think those existing submodules probably need to be removed, because changing language is important feature.. @nztqa \nCan you reproduce this bug?. @nztqa \nIs it possible to fix that without adding git submodules back?\nFor example, should I fork whole meteor repo to Wekan and add changes to there directly?. @nztqa \nI tested with those changes and could not reproduce bug anymore. Is it fixed for you too, using wekanteam latest docker image?. Fixed at 4fdcc144d5342b6571b9e53e9a18640871e0c18b. This still happends when using snap, when I tried to add wekan to sub-url like example.com/wekan , and there was Drupal website at example.com . I'll try to apply previous fixes to this.. Please test newest Ubuntu Snap, is double slash bug now fixed.\nIt seems to work for me.. With Nginx and Wekan at sub-url it works for me, there is no double slash bug, with Nginx and snap settings at this page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config. @tr37ion\nWekan is only compatible with MongoDB v3.2.x currently. Do you have MongoDB v3.4.x at server?\nOngoining Meteor 1.4 porting process can possibly bring MongoDB v3.4.x support, it's not known yet.\nCurrently file uploads crash Wekan with MongoDB v3.4.x. Also full build with compiling binary extensions including fibers etc is required for wekan to work correctly, or using precompiled .tar.gz version. Just running command meteor is not enough.. Can't you install MongoDB v3.2.x on your system? You can also import/export data between different versions of MongoDB:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data. Moved to #962. @Zokormazo \nYou need to first check that Wekan is not running at Sandstorm, and only then add first user as Admin, otherwise I cannot accept this pull request. See:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/sandstorm.js. So it needs to check environment variables first, is it running on Sandstorm.. Moved to #838. Moved to #794. Moved to #962. Related to #386 and https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS/issues/884. Merged. Is this now fixed?. @NoodleBB \nIs this same or different bug?. Moved to #962. @BaobabCoder \nDo you have time to check does link to this card or list work, and possibly fix so link works?. @bbenoist \nI don't know is that submodule really needed, as I already needed to remove it at #962\nWe'll see if it could be removed.\nWe are currently in progress of fixing #928 and doing upgrade #788\nAfter that, Windows build instructions at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-from-source-on-Windows may need also updating.. @neooleg \nDoes Wekan work without it? I have not tested that yet.. I will not merge anything that reintroduces double slash bug.. Now git clone works on Windows :)  You can check Linux from source instructions to see what other repos are needed.. @Nebelwolf \nI have been doing all my development on Ubuntu 16.04 based systems for a long time.\nOn Ubuntu 14.04 it currently requires build from source.. @Nebelwolf \nDo you mean compiling from source on 14.04 does not work? Or do we need releases for Ubuntu 14.04 ?. @Nebelwolf \nI will sometime test Wekan on Ubuntu 14.04 and add support for it.\nWe are currently in process of upgrading to Meteor 1.4 and Node v4.. @Nebelwolf \nPlease keep your errors in this issue. I will also keep this open until I have fixed this.. @Nebelwolf \nThanks!. Today's Wekan release v0.19 has been built on Ubuntu 14.04 and should work ok.. @faisalahmed \nIs this for some feature you are developing now?. @faisalahmed \nHave you looked at existing pull request, that currently does not build properly?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/446. @faisalahmed \nThat pull request may have some stuff that is not needed.. Moved to #797. @faisalahmed \nDoes cardClone code from #797 have something that helps you? It's originally linked to this:\nhttps://github.com/hsduk/wekan/tree/plugin-simple-timer/client/components/plugins\nand probably same code is also at devel branch:\nhttps://github.com/hsduk/wekan/tree/devel/client/components/plugins\n. @faisalahmed \nCan you share your current in-progress code of move and copy cards as pull request or GitHub gist?. Move and copy cards feature has already been added to Wekan.. Moved to #784. @huneau \nYou need to enter inside MongoDB Docker container to see MongoDB data:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data. @huneau \n```\nuser@u:~/repos$ git clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\n...\nuser@u:~/repos$ cd wekan-mongodb\n...\nRunning on terminal, Ctrl-C breaks:\nuser@u:~/repos/wekan-mongodb$ docker-compose up\n...\nOr: Running on background:\nuser@u:~/repos/wekan-mongodb$ docker-compose up -d\n...\nuser@u:~/repos/wekan-mongodb$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES\n2090d1567d12        wekanteam/wekan:meteor-1.4   \"node /build/main.js\"    About an hour ago   Up About an hour    0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   wekan-app\n0c71a9c73626        mongo:3.4.3                  \"docker-entrypoint...\"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour    27017/tcp            wekan-db\nuser@u:~/repos/wekan-mongodb$ docker exec -it wekan-db bash\nroot@0c71a9c73626:/# mongo\nMongoDB shell version v3.4.3\nconnecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017\nMongoDB server version: 3.4.3\nWelcome to the MongoDB shell.\nFor interactive help, type \"help\".\nFor more comprehensive documentation, see\n    http://docs.mongodb.org/\nQuestions?

Otherwise ROOT_URL needs to be setup to Wekan full url like https://example.com or https://example.com/wekan .. @khba \nInvitation email text is in source code, I think it's not localized yet. You can recursively search for it for example in linux:\n```\ncd wekan\nfind . | xargs grep 'some text in invitiation here' -sl\n```. It would be easier to clone Wekan github repo, make change there, and submit pull request.. Related #808 that is now in progress.\nThis issue has lower priority.. @udee297 \nDo you have ROOT_URL setup as full url for wekan already, like https://example.com or https://example.com/wekan ? And also PORT setup for example 3000 where wekan is running on localhost?. @n00b42 \nHey thanks a lot! I did not know that newest Meteor 1.4 port still has this problem with MongoDB 3.4.x.\nI will change dockerfiles to use MongoDB 3.2.12, there uploading attachments work, I tested it a moment ago.\n. Ok I have made changes to MongoDB 3.2.12.. @jony0008 \nI replied to remaining question at Transifex.\nUpdating translations to Wekan repo and Docker meteor-1.4 image is in progress.. This is already included in meteor-1.4 image:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. @huneau \nYes I agree. Submit pull request to meteor-1.4 branch.. See \"Translating login screen\" announcement at:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/announcements/\n. I added new announcement there, hoping that out translators add missing translations.. Actually, I probably need to change those in Wekan code. I'll try.. @GhassenRjab\nI did not yet figure out what is the correct filename for those translation files in wekan/i18n directory. I did try bre and no-NB, but they did not work for me when building Wekan. Transifex language to Wekan language https://github.com/softwarerero/meteor-accounts-t9n/tree/master/t9n mappings are at wekan/.tx/config .. @GhassenRjab\nCan you add pull request of sorting using the translated names?\nI'd like to try it to see how it looks.. @GhassenRjab \nThanks! Looks very nice :) Merged.. @GhassenRjab\nI fixed Norsk bokm\u00e5l at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/2522398233d2bbcc0a27f2551ea0504ac50862fd\nThere is still Breton br and Spanish (Spain) es-ES that would need correct language codes.. @GhassenRjab\nI removed extra es-ES that was not used at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/b98411a441585521e08e7aae0012bf7ce5d91600. I think I already manually merged this.. When you download binary tar.gz release of Wekan, you can start it with command meteor, there no need to build dependencies from source then.. @Braintelligence \nWhen I on GitHub watch a repo, I do get email notifications of all new issues, comments and commits to my email. So I think it works similarly on Wekan. I have not checked are there customization options for watching something specific.. @Braintelligence \nThere could be existing issues for mail, or you can create new separate issue about it.. Thanks. I already merged this manually.. @rhelsing \nNo, I will merge it sometime in near future.. Does this still happen on newest version?\n- newest Docker version:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\n- install from source:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source. @huneau \nPlease provide commands you used:\n\ninstalling all dependencies like node.js etc\nstarting wekan.\n\nI did not get it working yet, so probably I used wrong versions etc.. @huneau \nI need all steps of cloning repo, installing node.js version, and versions of other dependencies to reproduce working version of wekan. In addition, how do I test your feature and see how it works? What menu options are new, does it integrate with something, commands to use to test it, etc.. @huneau \nWhat node version are you using?. @phylophyl \nPlease create issue to:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-autoinstall/issues. @nztqa \nIs this already fixed?. Ok.. It's fixed on:\n- newest Docker version:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\n- install from source:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source\nThere will be new release sometime.\nI don't know is it useful to fix older releases.. Moved to #629. @mfshiu \n1) Does it not work? Do you get some error message?\n2) Is Wekan installed on your own laptop/desktop, or remote server?. Works for me.. @mfshiu \nWhen Wekan is installed to some web address, like http://something , you can login to that URL from multiple devices at the same time: desktop, mobile, etc when using that same URL. If you make change on one device like desktop, you will then see change on other devices like mobile etc immediately after that change.\nIs this what you did mean?\nOr does something not work?. @mfshiu \nIf you want to access Wekan in local LAN or in the Internet, you need to have your http port 80 or https port 443 open, so other computers can access that server.\nIt's also possible to use same database and have both LAN and VPN users access it https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1210 .\nOr do you have some problems when logging in with multiple devices? Please explain with more detail so I understand better :). @mfshiu \nBackup your Wekan 0.10 MongoDB database with:\nmongodump\nRestore it to Wekan 0.50 MongoDB with:\nmongorestore --drop\nIf you use Docker, see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nFor other Docker settings, see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-Docker-in-production\nIf you have any errors, please add your error messages to this GitHub issue.. Wekan compatible Node.js, MongoDB etc versions are mentioned at Dockerfile:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile. @mfshiu \nCurrently also @papoola is developing Custom Fields feature.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Roadmap\nI hope you have time to contribute your features, so others don't end up developing the same features.\nThanks! :). @mfshiu \nI added your features to Roadmap. Thanks!. @mfshiu \nWhat are the features of your Custom Fields vs these https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/807#issuecomment-336591782 ?. @mfshiu \nThere is existing working LDAP  code at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/119#issuecomment-287597821 but it's not integtated to Wekan yet. You could look does it or your code have more features. LDAP is very highly requested feature for standalone Wekan, it would be very nice to have.. LDAP configuration should be done with environment variables before starting Wekan.. @mfshiu \nCan you come to Vanila Chat and send me private message, so we can discuss about progress and sponsoring of these features?\nhttps://chat.vanila.io/channel/wekan. @mfshiu \nCan you give details how did you implement those features? Or could you have time to add pull request?. Archive = you can restore it from archived cards\nDelete = delete permanently. Deleteting list should work like deleting card.\nDeleting card\n1) Click 3 lines button / More\n\n2) Click Delete\n\n3) Show warning that there is no undo\n\nDeleting list\n1) Click 3 lines button / Remove list. It is deleted immediately, no questions asked.\nThere should be text Delete, not Remove. And same steps as in deleting card. Maybe even to this list.\n\n. Actually, I'll change translation text to add warning.. Ok I'll commit this soon, although I'll change IMMEDIATELY to NOW.\n\n. @BaobabCoder \nDo you have time to make deleting list similar to deleting card ?\nThanks for your original pull request for deleting list ! :). @willin \n1) What language is it? zh_CN or zh_TW or some other?\n2) Is translation for it here?\nhttps://github.com/softwarerero/meteor-accounts-t9n/tree/master/t9n\n3) What did you click to get that error?. Fixed by 6c26dad562cc50046c81bf9fedeb8b0923ff4827 (sorry, forgot to mention in commit message).\nReopen this if it still happens.\nClosing issue.. That code prevented changing language, so I had to revert it. So this could be still broken, but I don't know how to reproduce that error without step by step instructions.. @mo-han @willin \nPlease test today's new release v0.23, does this still happen?\nI was unable to reproduce this error with it with v0.23.. If this still happens, please reopen issue.. @AmrEldib \nOk, I have now changed repo url to https://wekan.github.io\nTwitter page has url http://wekan.io that redirects correctly to https://wekan.github.io\nI have asked @mquandalle does can he update https://wekan.io SSL cert sometime.. @huneau \nPlease enjoy wedding first, it's more important of course :). Fixed by https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1033. @stephenmoloney \nYes, I added alternative servers and it seems to work OK :). Fixed in 70ca6fdec96bf7c465ce12a80540c5d482492e13. @huneau \nPlease add authentication your REST API code to fix this security issue. Thanks!. That is problem on kelektiv's repo, there is no binary download version of that dependency available. I do not have any write permissions to kelektiv's repo and downloads of kelektiv's releases.\nIn Wekan, bcrypt is built from source, and bcrypt/bson error fixed here:\n1) Source install:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#in-production\nthese lines:\nsed -i \"s|build\\/Release\\/bson|browser_build\\/bson|g\" .build/bundle/programs/server/npm/node_modules/meteor/cfs_gridfs/node_modules/mongodb/node_modules/bson/ext/index.js\ncd .build/bundle/programs/server/npm/node_modules/meteor/npm-bcrypt\nrm -rf node_modules/bcrypt\nnpm install bcrypt\n2) Docker container's Dockerfile, links:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile#L109\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile#L110\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile#L111\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile#L112\nThose links are to this source code:\ngosu wekan sed -i \"s|build\\/Release\\/bson|browser_build\\/bson|g\" /home/wekan/app_build/bundle/programs/server/npm/node_modules/meteor/cfs_gridfs/node_modules/mongodb/node_modules/bson/ext/index.js && \\\ncd /home/wekan/app_build/bundle/programs/server/npm/node_modules/meteor/npm-bcrypt && \\\ngosu wekan rm -rf node_modules/bcrypt && \\\ngosu wekan npm install bcrypt && \\\n. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms. Moved to here from #1183\nFrom @Krantz-Man \n\nREST-API: Add card to list using POST request\nI noticed that there is an endpoint for what looks to be adding a new card (/api/users/:userid/boards/:boardid/lists/:listid/cards), but I could not find anything for what was required to be sent in the request body. Every time I send the post request, I just get back Internal Server Error.\n\n@mayjs @huneau \nCan you duplicate this, is there a bug ? Or is something missing from API ?. Example:\ncurl http://localhost:3000/users/login -d \"username=myloginname&password=mypassword\". @akuckartz \nYou can keep it here. What is JSON-LD ?. That's normal markdown in Wekan description. This is how you can make link in markdown, that below is list on links in markdown format:\n```\nWekan website\n```\nBut if you add this kind of \"list of links\" in markdown:\n```\n```\nIt then hides that list of links, and you did not provide the markdown required to display link text.. Thanks  :+1: I can reproduce this now! I did not know it was possible to do this!\nIt needs to be fixed sometime so that when this happens, it's possible to click Description to edit the invisible description.. It seems that Details text should be made to work the same as Edit below it, at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/client/components/cards/cardDetails.jade#L49-L74\n@rhelsing \nDo you know how to fix this? You changed that file during this year.. @GhassenRjab \nYou can also look if you have time.. I did not yet figure out how to add it to meteor build process that produces randomly named javascript file.. @kubenstein\nYes it is OK by MIT license.\nThere are some React related issues #299 #480 #953 we welcome pull requests for, if someone has time for them.. @kubenstein\nYes it is OK by MIT license.\nThere are some React related issues #299 #480 #953 we welcome pull requests for, if someone has time for them..

Some progress info is at:\nhttps://blog.wekan.team/2018/01/wekan-progress-on-x64-and-arm/index.html\nFirstly, there would need to be Meteor 1.6.0.1 crosscompiled for ARM64, that could probably make Wekan work on some 64bit Raspberry Pi distro for RasPi 3. Or alternatively Meteor framework would need to be crosscompiled for 32bit ARM that is used in Raspbian.\nAlso there is question that is there enough RAM to run Wekan on Raspberry Pi. 1 GB is minimum where Wekan can run, but it could start swapping. Odroid-U3 has 2 GB RAM, that would be better.\nSure there is also x86 boards like https://www.udoo.org , there x64 Wekan could probably work directly without modifications.. @Piggeldi2013 \nYes there is still a lot of work before Wekan is available for ARM Docker or Snap.

Install Wekan with Docker, for example:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-Docker-in-production\nUse Huginn of Flogo to call API\nREST API Docs\nThere will be some new REST API features in next release of Wekan.\n. @sirup \nThere is REST API Docs and Python client to REST API but I did not look at all features yet.\n@huneau @mayjs \nDo you know answer to this?. There is Linked Boards and Linked Cards feature in progress https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1592. @khba \nDo you use latest Wekan docker-mongodb ? Have you checked Troubleshooting Mail page?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms. @khba \nDo you use latest Wekan docker-mongodb ? Have you checked Troubleshooting Mail page?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms. @khba \nDoes postfix reject mail, or some outside server where you are sending mail ?. @khba \nUsually in email settings, if Wekan logs show nothing, the error is not in Wekan, but in some other system.. @khba \nYou could check are email addresses same both at environment variables and Admin Panel.\nAnd if you change email address back to wekan2@yourdomain.com , does this fix those problems?. @khba \nCan you update to today's latest version of Docker container and check are there still problems?. @khba \nDo you have spam filtering there, that could reject message?\nOr is it possible to get the actual message content captured somehow to see why it was rejected?\nWhat language you you use in Wekan, could it complain about some unicode characters?. @khba \nFrom those logs it looks like that Wekan sent email successfully, but postfix bounced message because of some rule.. @khba \nI don't know could there be some blacklist or some other email server related issue.. @khba \nSome email servers require SPF records to ensure deliverability.. Ok seems that remaining issues are not related to Wekan itself.\nIf there is something still related Wekan, please reopen issue.. @nztqa \nDoes this fix #879 or is this separate issue?. Known issue with MongoDB 3.4.x.\nUse MongoDB 3.2.x\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. I will use DRAKON as external editor for this: http://drakon-editor.sourceforge.net\nOriginal repo is here:\nhttps://github.com/stepan-mitkin/drakon_editor\nI'll make my changes in this forked repo, and then send pull requests:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/drakon_editor. DRAKON programming is mostly using some programming language with flowchart style, it does not generate code for different programming languages like Haxe yet.\nAnother option is to use Huginn that is mentioned at #1160\nIt still needs some testing which one to use.. Moved to #1160. @pradeepgokul \nPlease remove commits from pull request that touch other files than those that are necessary for your new feature.\nWhen you add new commits, please add some descriptive text that's different from \"updates for new commits\".\nThis way there would be less possibility of merge conflicts.\nThanks!. @pradeepgokul\nPlease edit your pull request name what feature this adds, and also edit comment of pull request to add summary what parts it contains. Thanks!. @GhassenRjab \nCan you look at this?. In-progress local install of npm modules etc. @pnizet \nHow you did install Wekan to your Windows laptop?\nHow much RAM is in your laptop?. @pnizet \nDoes you synology NAS have x64 processor?. @pnizet\nOn Windows, are you using these compatible versions with Wekan? Because for example Node.js 6.x causes 100% CPU usage.\n- Node.js 4.8.1\n- NPM 4.6.1\n- fibers 1.0.15\n- MongoDB 3.2.14\nWekan uses Meteor framework that currently works on x64.\nIt does not work yet on Raspberry Pi #1053 etc ARM processors, that would need some more research and work.. Yes, I don't know how to reduce memory usage.. @ripclaw \n8 GB RAM is plenty. UDOO x86 supports 64bit Linux distros. I would recommend using Ubuntu 18.04 64bit or Debian 9 64bit with Wekan Snap.\nWekan does run with 2 GB RAM, although more is of course better. Production systems usually have 4 GB or more.. @nztqa \nLink to lists feature was removed from Trello due to implementation issues:\nhttps://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/33661/can-you-link-trello-cards-boards\nThere could be anchor to that list, and it to be showed in url, but could there be similar implementation issues for Wekan later when moving lists to other boards is implemented and those links could break?. Moved to #709. @huneau \nCan you look at this?. @huneau \nIs it possible to fix this ?. @zarnifoulette\nFix lint errors:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Developer-Documentation#preventing-travis-ci-lint-errors-before-submitting-pull-requests\nRelated to #1037\n@huneau @mayjs \nDoes this exists in Wekan? Or is this new?. Can you try to debug more with this?\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6095530/maximum-call-stack-size-exceeded-error\nAre you running latest Wekan v0.27 ? There was fix for duplicate id generation:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md\nYou could also try cleanup scripts:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-cleanup. Are all those many Wekan instances using same MongoDB database with same boards etc? I don't know how well MongoDB handles concurrency or will there be locking issues, Wekan instances overwriting each others data.\nI could sometime try to get Wekan working with newest ToroDB, to see if ToroDB can replace MongoDB fully. Related project:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-postgresql. @GavinLilly \nYes. Do Google searches with that error message to find if somebody has fix for this, and add links to this issue.. I could try updating meteor and every package like in that Github issue mentioned by @GavinLilly \n@ocdtrekkie @kentonv\nDo you know is there any issues with using newer version of Meteor with Sandstorm?\nDoes capnp only work with Meteor 1.4 ?\nCurrently Wekan uses Meteor 1.4.4.1 as can be seen in Dockerfile.. Using markdown at checlists was already added to Wekan release v0.55 . So you can add links as markdown.. @nztqa \nWIth random ids, is there possibility of collisions if there is many checklists with same id ?. Ok, I think I don't merge this.. Done.. # Mitigation\na)  Add Basic Auth in front of Wekan, if Wekan is exposed to Internet\nb) Add Google Auth in front Wekan\nc)  Run Wekan on local network that does not have access to Internet\nd) Use old version of Wekan in Sandstorm that makes usage safe on Internet with Sandstorm's auth. @rautamiekka \nAll data is stored to MongoDB.\nFiles are stored in CollectionFS format, so using them manually with direct database access with tools like Robo 3T could be problematic, I don't know does CollectionFS storage format spread one file to multiple database records. There is pull request to change it.\nFor using files directly, see cleanup scripts.. I didn't notice yet does REST API have features for uploading and downloading files.. @killua-eu \nIt looks like that there's just first one step implemented:\n[X] Basic attachment upload/download/delete support\nMore details can be seen from pull request source code.. http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2015/07/19/why-you-should-never-ever-ever-use-mongodb/. @GhassenRjab \nCould Wekan export/import also include attachments as base64 encoded (or similarly encoded) files directly to .json file? That would make it easier to import it to Sandstorm.. @GhassenRjab \nOk it's merged now.. @GhassenRjab \nThanks! When that feature starts working in Wekan then authentication could be added for files on non-public boards and Import/Export of Wekan board would still work.. Thanks! I added those to wiki:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install-snap-with-Ansible. @nammn \nI have created Beginner label and also started adding that to issues with details about what to do.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail\nDoes sending email work with some other program with those credentials?\nUsually when there is no errors in Wekan logs, emails are sent successfully, and problem is in email server:\n- email server missing SPF DNS records\n- some spam filter preveinting email to be sent\n- other email server error. That error comes when Wekan is offline. If wekan really is online, just refresh page.\nDid you use modified docker-compose.yml file to run Wekan?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. On docker-compose file, did you set ROOT_URL to real wekan address on Nginx, for example https://example.com/wekan ?. and also port to localhost port to the port where Wekan is running on localhost ?. That looks like old version version of docker-compose file. It has old version of MongoDB and also other differences, when compared to:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml. I recommend that you backup and reinstall Wekan.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nCleanup and delete all Docker data to get Docker Compose working https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/985. @mickael-kerjean \nI think that the error should be replaced with different text.. @jtickle \nPlease test latest wekanteam docker image after it's built, does this really fix it for you.. @X-dark @ropeladder \nIs this same as Custom Fields #807 ?\nOr is there some additional functionality needed ?. Moved to #807. @adngdb \nDo you have same correct settings for MAIL_URL in docker-compose.yml and Admin Panel ?\nDoes sending email work without TLS with some other program on server?\nIt's complaining about self-signed certificate. You could add paid or free Let's Encrypt TLS certificate to your email SMTP server.\nAlso see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. Does this still happen on Wekan v0.28 that includes SMTP fix #1131 ?. @kubiko \nDo you have ideas how to fix this?. I did today some STARTTLS debugging, and got it working with following, you can test:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail#starttls-sending-test-email-failed. @Yachikh \nPlease share your current code as GitHub gist or pull request to Wekan devel branch as @rautamiekka said above, otherwise it's very hard to enlighten you.. @Yachikh \nThere is no requirements of code quality. Everybody starts as a beginner..  @Yachikh \nSome timer code seems to be here, it's not yet in Wekan, you could check does it help.\n. @Reneeeee \nI have merged Wefork back to Wekan previously:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#what-was-wekan-fork--wefork\nCurrently Sandstorm has old version of Wekan, after that there has been lots of changes. Anyway at some point of time Sandstorm will get latest version of Wekan.\nI will test does this bug happen on standalone source/Docker version of Wekan.. @ocdtrekkie\nWhat do you think, is it ok to release new version of Wekan although #1105 is not fixed yet? Fixing it would require import of Wekan board to handle attachments as base64 encoded into JSON, and then preventing access to files without authorization.\nI don't know does current version of capnp work with current version of Wekan.\n. @ocdtrekkie\nOk thanks, I'll release new version of Wekan. I also would like to get import/export of of Wekan board with attachments working in Sandstorm as it's blocking some deployments of Sandstorm. I'll look at it at some point of time with @GhassenRjab .. @ocdtrekkie\nI presume that bug has been on Wekan always, I don't know what version has introduced it. It's just that someone found it recently. The same bug is still at Trello, that's how importing attachments to Wekan work, although I have not checked the code yet.. @ocdtrekkie\nAnother alternative is to wait that:\n- base64 attachments to JSON are implemented\n- authentication is added to standalone Wekan's files\n- Wekan import and export can be made visible at Sandstorm\nAnd then get it working on Sandstorm.. Moved to #953. Yes. Set board as Public, then board publically visible in read-only mode, without login.\nDoes this answer your question?. There is not yet a way to edit without login. So you would create new user account \"Anonymous\" and add info that those wanting to edit need to login with that \"Anonymous\" username and password.\nUser permissions for boards are Admin / Normal / Comment only.\nFor example you could have that \"Anonymous\" user have Comment only permission, so only adding comments is allowed.\n. Moved Anonymous Comment/Edit and Moderation #313 to here.. @guakamole \nYes, someone should look at Wekan code about how to implement this.. @guakamole \nFor development docs, look at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki#Development\nWekan source code is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan\nThere is also general user management options missing from Admin Panel:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#wishes-for-admin-panel\nAccording to Open Hub, Wekan code is only about 7000 lines of code, without adding additional node modules etc, so it's quite small when compared to other software. This is becauser Meteor.js framework provides so much functionality built-in.\nhttps://www.openhub.net/p/wekan\nYou can see with graphical Git history viewer how various features have been made:\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/uz/v2/Git-in-Other-Environments-Graphical-Interfaces\nI currently use gitk on Linux.\nI think there is no need to create anonymous user at install time.\nAnonymous user settings could work like this below, also note that during development you could come up with better ideas, this is just a suggestion:\nADMIN PANEL SETTINGS for Wekan admin: Anonymous users\n```\nAnonymous username: ________\nAnonymous user permissions: [Normal / Comment Only]   <== dropdown options\n[Create Anonymous User] <=== button\nList of Anonymous users:\n[X] Anonymous Username1\n[X] Anonymous Username2\nList of all boards:\nList [*] All [_] Anonymous user enabled\n[X] Boardname1 [List of Anonymous users in this board]\n[X] Boardname2 [List of Anonymous users in this board]\nOptions for selected Anonymous users on selected boards:\n[] Enable anonymous user on selected boards\n[] Disable anonymous user on selected boards\n[] Delete all comments by Anonymous user on selected boards \n[] Delete anonymous user\n[_] Move comments to this Anonymous user: [Dropdown of all Anonymous Users]\n[Run actions for selected Anonymous users]    <=== button\n```\nBOARD SETTINGS for board admin: Anonymous user\n[_] Anonymous write access  <=== Enable/Disable\nAnonymous username: [Dropdown list of all anonymous users]. @killua-eu \nI think error message means than you need to upgrade your snap software to version 2.25, for example:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt -y dist-upgrade. https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/581. https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy/+bug/1693037/comments/8. What version of Wekan snap you have? I have this:\n```\n$ sudo snap info wekan\nname:      wekan\nsummary:   \"The open-source Trello-like kanban\"\npublisher: xet7\ndescription: |\n  Wekan is an open-source and collaborative kanban board application.\nWhether you\u2019re maintaining a personal todo list, planning your holidays with\n  some friends, or working in a team on your next revolutionary idea, Kanban\n  boards are an unbeatable tool to keep your things organized. They give you a\n  visual overview of the current state of your project, and make you productive\n  by allowing you to focus on the few items that matter the most.\n  Depending on target environment, some configuration settings might need to be\n  adjusted.\n  For full list of configuration options call:\n  $ wekan.help\ncommands:\n  - wekan.database-backup\n  - wekan.database-list-backups\n  - wekan.database-restore\n  - wekan.help\ntracking:           stable\ninstalled:          0.27 (8) 123MB -\nrefreshed:          2017-06-28 15:13:07 +0300 EEST\nchannels:                            \n  latest/stable:    0.27          (8)  123MB -\n  latest/candidate: 0.27          (8)  123MB -\n  latest/edge:      0.27-SNAPSHOT (16) 124MB -\n```\nI'm just thinking how to replicate your error, because Wekan snap works for me.. Is there any related info here?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/4. How are you running Wekan in dedicated lxd container? Did you install Wekan somehow differently than described here?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. This could be related to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1114 and it's fixes of npm package paths. I'm in progress of fixing it for Docker, it could also affect snap packages.. I recommend just reinstalling wekan snap, as it currently works for me.\nSecurity issue is blocking new release of Wekan.. Internal server error is usually because of unability to send registration email.\nYou can still login as that new user, as it's created anyway.. You can change yourself as board admin https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1060#issuecomment-310545976. Doh, I did mean enable admin panel for user etc:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms. I did some updates, you could try those sometime when newest Wekan snap is built:\nlatest/edge: 0.27-SNAPSHOT (17)\nCurrently there most likely still is this old version:\nlatest/edge: 0.27-SNAPSHOT (16)\nI'll check later that build progress etc.. You could try journalctl commands to get more verbose logs:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Troubleshooting\nI have not checked is it possible to change password using API:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1037\nor is it possible to change on MongoDB. You could for example in MongoDB copy your new user password hash to your old user password hash.. @mayjs \nYes. In that talk there is probably links for code and hardware how to get it working.. Ok.. Moved to #802. Moved to #953. You have old version of Node.js, please see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-and-build-wekan\nAnd also platforms where Wekan is available:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms. Upgrades done at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/951305381669dfe1d33912f20e3c7e68cf782336\nI'm currently checking for build errors.. @GhassenRjab \nI tested with this Wekan board, that has attachment image, checklist and due date:\n\nExport file seems to have base64 attachment.\nThen I went to import that json file back. I don't know is there missing translation, or why title of import page seems strange:\n\nWhen I mapped Wekan board to users, and tried to import it, I got this error, so I was unable to import it:\n\nAlso see my comments about getting this to work on Sandstorm at #799. @dimidd \nYou need to setup ROOT_URL to your real Wekan address, like https://example.com/wekan or https://IP-DDRESS-HERE/wekan\nWhat webpage did you use for install? I'll try to add this required info there.\nDocker:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml\nSource:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#run-wekan-manually-if-youve-built-for-production\nWekan snap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\n. @nztqa \nOk :) No problem.. Hi,\nWekan building from source is stable, but not all pages on wiki are up-to-date yet, although I update them nearly daily. As seen from GitHub repo changelog, I recently added menu to wiki.\nThat install from source without sudo page is in progress and not complete. Only running npm commands as local user should be used from that without sudo page. For most commands this should be used:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source\nYou have wrong versions of node and npm.\nCorrect versions can be seen for example at Dockerfile that uses Debian 8.8:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile\nand also VirtualBox wekan-rebuild.sh script:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/tree/master/virtualbox\nWekan uses Meteor.js framework that currently runs on x64 systems. Your logfile says that you use Linux 2.6.32-48-pve kernel, is that on x32 system?\nWekan does not yet run on ARM systems like Raspberry Pi and some ARM devices #1053\nFor easiest installation and newest features, I recommend any updated often platform like Docker or Ubuntu snap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms\nInfo about Wekan RAM usage is at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1088#issuecomment-311843230\nWhen building Wekan, errors about capnp can be ignored. Some binary versions that build script tries to download are not available, so they are build from source.\nWhat debian version and hardware are you trying to run Wekan on?. @hanneslehmann \nWekan Ubuntu snap is available on Debian sid:\nhttps://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install-debian\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\n. I think, but it could also be that snap only works on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit, I'm not sure, needs testing.. WOW now you are using node 8.1.4, that really is not compatible :)\nWe currently use node 4.8.4.. @hanneslehmann \nYou start it with run-wekan.sh script:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#run-wekan-manually-if-youve-built-for-production\nThere ROOT_URL is for example:\n- http://192.168.10.100\n- http://192.168.10.100/wekan\n- http://example.com\n- http://example.com/wekan. @Yachikh \nIs your Wekan running?\nHow did you install Wekan ?. @Yachikh\nI have not yet tested installing on Windows.\nSomebody did install Wekan for Windows at #1088\nCurrently in use versions of dependecies can be seen at Dockerfile, what versions do you use?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile. It depends do you have saving history in browser enabled, do same browser tabs open. Also you need Internet connection to save data.. @ekarademir \nCan you try again with newest wekanteam:latest Docker image? Because double slash bug related to opening cards was fixed recently.. @ekarademir @tac0x2a \na) Check that you have admin rights to board\nb) Is it possible for you to export Wekan board where this issue happens, and attach JSON to this issue in .zip file? If there is private data, you can try to delete those first. It would help me reproduce this issue, and check exported JSON file first there is no private data left. \nKeep backups:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data. Moved to #1120. @lucasdiedrich \nWhere did you get installation instructions to use old v0.10.40 version of Node?\nYou can see current version numbers of requirements at Dockerfile.. @lucasdiedrich\nFor easiest install on CentOS 7, I recommend Install using Docker\nThere is also  Troubleshooting CentOS 7.\n. @lucasdiedrich \nChange ROOT_URL on docker-compose.yml to your Wekan URL like for example:\n- http://192.168.10.100 \n- http://192.168.10.100/wekan\n- http://example.com\n- http://example.com/wekan. #799 discusses about making this available in new version of Wekan for Sandstorm.. @JeremyIglehart \nEasiest way to install to AWS is to install Ubuntu Server 16.04 64bit image and then use Ubuntu snap to install Wekan:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\nWhat is MUP ?. Please reopen issue if you still have problems.. @nztqa \nCan you add info about Webhooks to Features page Webhooks ?. @ckiltolier \nPlease add screenshot of Wekan where you have modified colors to be dark.. Ok :) I'll try with Stylish browser extension what it looks like, and see how to make those changes in Wekan.. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Custom-CSS-themes. @gerroon \nPlease install Stylish browser extension and copy to it above css overrides by @lonix1 . That way you can have dark mode. If some colors need changing to have real dark mode, please change css and add your version of css overrides to this issue as comment. Thanks!. There seems to be this dark mode user style script already:\nhttps://userstyles.org/styles/148526/wekanocalypse\nIf someone has improvements to that, please add that to userstyles.org website.\nIf some of those styles works well in Wekan, I could include it to Wekan.. I did try some of those existing color changes above but they did not look so good. Wekan has dark board color at board colors, but it's not like dark theme yet.. I did add to wiki some temporary solutions to Dark Mode:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Dark-Mode. @soerenk \nYour issue moved to #1157. @VictorQRS \nNo, this issue about Redmine is not closed. Wekan does not have Redmine import/export yet.\n@soerenk had different issue about Trello import, that was moved #1157. @danhawkes \nCan you try to add pull request for those files to devel branch?. @greinbold \nTry these:\n1) Docker\nhttps://wiki.freebsd.org/Docker\n1a) Directly with Docker:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo:3.2.15\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080\" -p 8080:80 wekanteam/wekan:latest\n```\nYou could also use release tags like wekanteam/wekan:v0.32 because sometimes latest is broken, although currently latest works.\nIf you want to access Wekan from local network computers, changel localhost to your computer IP address. Then Wekan would be at http://192.168.10.100:8080 or similar. You could also try changing port 8080 to 80 if there's nothing running on 80.\n1b) Witch Docker-compose:\nhttps://github.com/docker/compose/issues/4723\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\n2) Using VirtualBox:\nhttps://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox\nhttps://wekan.xet7.org. @greinbold \nYour install from source misses many steps. Please check rebuild-wekan.sh at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/tree/master/virtualbox\nSome of install steps are commented out in that rebuild-wekan.sh script because on VirtualBox I don't install all dependencies every time, as they are already installed.\nFor running Wekan, in the same repo in run-wekan.sh . You need to change ROOT_URL to your full Wekan URL, like http://192.168.10.100 or http://example.com or http://example.com/wekan .. @greinbold \nHave you tried these?. I have not tested does this also happen with Import / Export of Wekan board.. @aaronkjones \nOn first line is the reason:\ngpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 7: couldn't connect: eof\nWhen building Docker Compose from source, build script gets GPG keys from different servers to verify that downloaded addons hashes match. Keyservers are sometimes overloaded, so you need to try again.\nBuilding Docker Compose from source is only required during development.\nIf you just want to use Wekan, you can use Wekan-MongoDB with newest release number or latest tag.. One alternative to Huginn is Flogo:\nhttps://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/455\nhttp://www.flogo.io\nhttps://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo. @jttttttttt\nI will test both Huginn and Flogo, and then use the one that is better. Implementation starts after you have added your bounty to this issue:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/47991500-feature-request-if-this-then-that-style-support-i-e-recurring-cards. @jttttttttt\nNot yet, I need to do some tests.. I'm starting to work on this feature soon.. @jttttttttt \nI wish ETA could be about 2-4 weeks, but I'm not so good with estimates.. @jttttttttt \nThis is important feature that I need for other customer also, so this will get done anyway.. @killua-eu \nFlogo, because it can make small binary with Go. Huginn uses too much RAM with Ruby etc.\nI'm in progress of fixing REST API on Standalone Wekan and Sandstorm Wekan and adding more to REST API, before I can work on this IFTTT.\n@Digital-Thor \nYour UI for automation is good starting point. I would add that:\n- Each swimlane could have settings for swimlane color, like there is for board color\n- Those texts like \"Add Automation\" and \"Add Case\" could be translatable in Transifex https://transifex.com/wekan/wekan like currently other translations are\n- Swimlane could also have setting about what type of Swimlane is it, for example Case, Automation, etc\n- I'd like to target more of general usage, not just limited to email\n- I don't want that Wekan automation UI looks too much like Trello, but dropdown selectors are used for task selection also in Kanboard, so it's a standard way to implement automation. Probably those dropdowns could be configured with JSON config text to swimlane settings.\nAll of that automation tasks, like sending emails, scheduled events, etc will happen in automation client, that is programmed with Flogo and Go. It uses REST API get data from Wekan, and send results back. This way it can automate both Standalone Wekan (Docker, Snap) and Sandstorm Wekan. There is Sandstorm issue about Create API for apps to schedule background tasks, but it remains to be seen when it'll be implemented. At Sandstorm Wekan grains start and stop as needed, so reacting to scheduled events at exact time is not possible, grain could be stopped when that event would happen.\nThat Go-based automation client can also be included inside docker/snap/sandstorm etc if that would benefical for some reason, that just need some startup script that starts both Wekan and automation client.\nCurrent automation already in Wekan is for example copying checklist template to multiple cards with JSON config as destination cards. I do like this approach very much.\nThere has been some problems with setting up email, partly related to email features Meteor framework has. If this email functionality is migrated to Go automation client, it makes supporting various email systems easier.. Ok, that could change design to be this way:\nSwimlane settings:\n- Swimlane color\n- Swimlane rename \"Add Card\" to Add _\nAbout 'Butler' user: Currently only admin has access to Wekan REST API, so actions are made as the REST API logged in user. It could be also later possible to use REST API as normal user.\nI don't know is it useful to build all the automation workflow UI to Wekan UI directly, because when Wekan is running inside Docker/Snap/Sandstorm, Wekan most likely does not have direct access to hardware.\nFlogo has this kind of workflow designer, I opened example workflow in Flogo's Docker container web interface:\n\nI'm thinking that just making Wekan to have as good REST API as possible, having access to everything in Wekan REST API, and using Flogo to implement all workflows would be good starting point.\nThis is still at brainstorming / ideas level, feedback welcome.. It's also not necessary that Flogo automation would need to poll constantly what is currently at board. Wekan stats features have Winston logger, so all activity at boards could go to Flogo app as input, and it would react to those events that have some actions in them.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#stats\nWhen starting flogo app, it could read from Wekan using REST API, is there any due date and automation related info in Wekan, and store it to flogo app's own database. That way flogo could do those actions, like accessing other apps with REST API, when Sandstorm Wekan grain is not running.. One problem in using external tool like Flogo is usability, translations, switching between different tools, and the need for data transfer between Wekan and other tool, so it would add additional complexity.\nIt seems that Flogo is available only in English.\nFor standalone Wekan, mostly what's missing is having scheduled background tasks. This can be added in standalone Wekan, probably using some Meteor or npm package.\nWhen running at Sandstorm, some scheduled background tasks API could be in Sandstorm itself, and it could start Wekan grain when needed.. When running flogo, I got this message to console:\n2018-04-13T07:06:36.253Z - verbose: GET /i18n/fi.json - 0\nSo it seems that there probably is already possibility to do translation.\nProbably I just should try to implement some use case and see how it goes with Flogo and Wekan REST API.. @killua-eu \nUI is node.js project inside docker, and the repo for it is not public.\nEULA is this 250 page PDF file, it includes licenses of all included software:\nhttp://www.flogo.io/flogo-docker_eula.pdf. @Angtrim \nThose trigger, action, and, or, etc  words could be in dropdowns, and be translatable. And also ability to add and remove rules. Yes you can try to start implement it.. Moved to here from #1792\nFrom @tigger10 \nA feature request: when creating a new card, could a label (colour) be auto-assigned.\nFor example, I have a Work and Home backlog lists. Cards are then moved to a Buffer list but then it's difficult to visually sort the original cards from Work and Home. Assigning an auto-colour could help.. @Angtrim \nWould this make possible:\nWhen card is moved from one list to another,\nsend email that has card name as subject line of email.. @d3dbit \nCurrently @Angtrim has in progress adding IFTTT directly to Wekan, without Flogo and Huginn.\nIt is already possible to do IFTTT by using Wekan REST API https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API with any programming language, and Flogo/Huginn, if you are in a hurry and need it right now.\nI have not had yet have time to look how Flogo and Huginn works.. Wekan v1.47 released today, includes. IFTTT rules. Please test and report bugs.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md. IFTTT already mostly works on edge:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Snap-Developer-Docs\nSome small issues still to fix, as seen from comments at #1912. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1936 has fix to most of #1912 that will be closed.\nSo what's actually left is:\n- Editable rules\n- Add checklist items to checklists.\n- Existing lists dropdown.\nProgress on those will be added to this issue.. @sfahrenholz \nWekan v1.53.2 snap+docker included latest IFTTT.\nYou can add docs to this wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/IFTTT\nThere can also be animgifs in that documentation, that would be even better. Someone can use peek to record animgif in Linux https://github.com/phw/peek\nAnd attact screenshots and animgifs to this issue in zip file.. It's known issue that Wekan crashes when uploading attachment on MongoDB 3.4.x\nPlease use MongoDB 3.2.x\nFor more info about versions please see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile. @msergg \nI did add Requirements page to wiki. Moved to #1198 . Have you tried troubleshooting mail ?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. @martster  @karuppiah7890 \nDo you still have problems with this?. Ok, then this can be closed, as email works for me.. Moved to #799. There are already existing feature requests:\n- Swimlanes\n- Card background color\n- Custom Fields. @aaronkjones \nDoes this still happen?. @sk33z3r \nWhat are the differences between those 2 boards that successfully import and 2 that don't ?\nHave you added names to all labels, so there are no unnamed labels in the board?\nDo you use some features Wekan does not yet have, like stickers ?. @sk33z3r\nIt would be useful if there's possible to try to create new Trello board, add something to it, export to Wekan, and have that trigger the problem so this could be reproduced.. @sk33z3r \nPlease test with newest Wekan does this still happen.\nThere has been some import export fixes for Standalone and Sandstorm versions.\nAttachment activities fixes will be added in near future.. @sk33z3r \nWhen I had previously problems with JSON, I used http://www.jsondiff.com (on that address is also link to it's source code) to see differences in JSON files, if some fields are missing etc, and after that somebody made that problematic field optional, as can be seen in Git history. Then Import Export started to work. There also could be other tools that can be used to compare JSON files.. No example JSON file provided, can not reproduce.. @yonta \nOnly English language is updated with pull requests when adding new features.\nOther languages are translated at Transifex, please add your changes there:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/\nThanks!. Date format is country specific, see latests comments at previously closed issue #838. Ok, this could be per user setting like:\n- Language\n- Date format. @lslamp \nBritish English has DD/MM/YYYY and same English as US English. Date format depends on language selected, it's not yet possible to change date format independently yet, because nobody has contributed this feature as pull request to devel branch.. @lslamp \nThere is VirtualBox VM with build scripts, smaller one based on Ubuntu 14.04 also works for this:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nYou can update with:\ncd repos/wekan\ncd ..\n./rebuild-wekan-meteor-1.6.sh\nand use option 3 for rebuild.\nThen use live debugging:\ncd wekan\nmeteor\nand make changes to files at wekan subdirectories, you see in browser does it work, and debug messages at terminal. \nDeveloper Docs:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Developer-Documentation\nDirectory Structure:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Directory-Structure\nHere is components like cards etc:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/client/components\nMeteor.js etc javascript code saves all to MongoDB database.\nAt top right there is board hamburger menu where per-user setting of language is selected.\nBelow that could be per-user setting for date format.\nFor database additions, you need to add to models:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/models\nYou need to use migrations to get new database schema applied when upgrading:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/migrations.js\nYou can add your progress to this issue.\nIf you get it working, also check for linting errors as described in Developer Docs, fork Wekan, add your changes, submit pull request to wekan/wekan devel branch.\nWhen you get errors, check Meteor.js docs for Meteor version 1.6.0.1, and also Google search for error messages. Also look at wekan/wekan git history with history viewer like gitk, how previous features have been implemented. If that does not help, ask question in comment to this github issue.\nThanks!\n. Moved to here from #838\n@BjoernLudwigPTB\nIt's possible to support development development of this feature, more info at https://wekan.team. @Johnhacker \nYes.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#translations\n. @kaefert \nHave you tried installing MongoDB 3.2 from binary tarball? I don't know is it really necessary to compile MongoDB.\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux/. @kaefert \nI think using Gmail for sending email does not work.\nI recommend registering free account at SendGrid and using it to send email with these settings for ports.\nIn addition to MAIL_URL, setup same setting in Admin Panel.\nAlso do check Troubleshooting Email.. @kaefert \nApache config\nWekan config:\nROOT_URL='http://192.168.16.8/wekan'\nexport PORT=8081. Moved to #1037. I tested this using Chrome on Puppy Linux Finnish version FinPuppy, it did work fine, Desktop Shortcut would work similarly:\n/opt/google/chrome/chrome --app=\"http://192.168.10.100/sign-in\"\nOn Windows Desktop Shorcut options did work similarly:\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" --app=\"http://192.168.10.100/sign-in\"\nThanks!. Moved to #552 . I have this is in progress, see Roadmap. \n. This work on Standalone Wekan, but not on Sandstorm.\nFrom @AlexanderZobkov at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/799#issuecomment-325558114\n\nRegarding #1188, probably it make sence to create a new issue (telling that #1188 does not work in Sandstorm) or re-open the old one, for the following reason:\nURLs like https://something.sandcats.io/grain/RANDOMTEXT2/b/sandstorm/libreboard/RANDOMTEXT1 (in my case http://RANDOMTEXT2hostname.domain/b/sandstorm/libreboard/RANDOMTEXT1) that could be taken by using your brower capabilies  does not work for others. they get something like \nError: Unauthorized [403]\n    at Proxy.makeContext (server/proxy.js:1660:15)\n    at server/proxy.js:1899:19\n    at /programs/server/npm/node_modules/meteor/promise/node_modules/meteor-promise/fiber_pool.js:32:39. Moved to #876. @ocdtrekkie\n\nIs this only Sandstorm issue? Or does this need changes to Wekan?. Sandstorm has old version of Wekan, new Wekan version works but is not released yet as can be seen from Roadmap. I will need to test does this still happen on new version of Wekan for Sandstorm.. Moved to here from #1366\nFrom @sjoki \nHi.\nWekan version: 0.59.0~2017-11-23 Sandstorm version: v0.221 (2017-11-20)\nI use SAML in sandstorm for authenticate users. When I create new board I can add any user to my board. But I d\u043e not have any menu command or anything else to remove user from my board. I have only command 'Filter Cards' in the upper right corner 'Members' section.\nWhat are the ways to delete a user?. Moved to #794. It does not lose content in newest Wekan v1.03.. @callahad \nPlease record gif video how to reproduce this. I could not reproduce this.. @safeershahul\nWhen running Wekan in Sandstorm, in menu \"Admin Panel / Personalization\" there is \"Custom logo on sign-in dialog\" where you can upload your own logo.. @pqsky \n1) Clone wekan/wekan repo\n2) Change logo file\n3) In source code wekan directory, use Docker Compose to build from source with this command:\nsudo docker-compose up -d --build\nI have not tested this yet, but it should work.. I'm currently building new Wekan release v1.75 that has new feature: Hide Logo.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v175-2018-11-20-wekan-release\nIt's a first step. I try to figure out Custom Logo later.. Plans about whitelabeling etc here:\nhttps://blog.wekan.team/2018/11/year-2018-what-we-archieved/index.html. There is now at Admin Panel:\n- Hide Logo\n- Custom Product Name\nAlso in translations name Wekan is replaced with general descriptions at least in English and Finnish, and maybe others, if translators have translated correctly.\nAfter these changes, text \"Wekan\" is only visible at Adming Panel Version, that shows Wekan version.. @muho-asta \n1) Try to save all your grains to files with arrow down button on Sandstorm. For those grains that do open, also Export them as Wekan JSON files.\n2) Remove Wekan app from Sandstorm\n3) Install some old Wekan .spk version from:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases?after=v0.16\n4) Upload your problem grain and try to download attachment\nAlso, in that saved Sandstorm grain is all data from that grain's MongoDB database, but I have not yet tried how to get data from those files directly.. It is possible to repair MongoDB database this way:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-from-Wekan-Sandstorm-grain-.zip-file\nSo you can restore it to Standalone Wekan like Snap or Docker.\nI will later create tool to make Sandstorm grain .zip file, or another way to import to Sandstorm.\nMoved  #1695. @m-thielen \nWhere are you trying to install Wekan?\n- Operating System version\n- does computer have x64 processor and OS ?\n- did you use sudo with snap? sudo snap install wekan\n- have you installed all updated to your OS, like sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ?\n- please add more details: full install log when you install from source\n- did you use MongoDB 3.2.x ? Wekan is not compatible with MongoDB 3.4.x when uploading files.\nInstall from source instructions are at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source\n. I tested:\n Created new Ubuntu 16.04 VM with 1GB RAM in AWS Lightsail\n Did attach public Elastic IP\n* Installed all updates\nThen I added settings mentioned in these snap docs:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\nThese settings keys:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nLike this (ip address changed)\nsudo snap install wekan\nsudo snap set wekan root-url=\"http://123.456.789.0\"\nsudo snap set wekan port=80\nsudo snap disable wekan\nsudo snap enable wekan\nAnd Wekan did work, I did not see any errors.\nAlso install from source instructions do work for me.\nPlease add your install from source logs, etc errors. I don't see any obvious errors.. In VirtualBox VM, scripts are at /home/wekan/repos directory.\nDid you install Ubuntu Server from .iso ? Is it running on some cloud like AWS/Google/Azure/Digital Ocean or some of your hardware?. What kernel? snap requires new enough kernel.. Kernel is new enough.\nIt could be that OpenVZ forbids some mounting privileges.. You could install Meteor.js with install script from https://www.meteor.com\nThen download precompiled tar.gz package from:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nAnd then start Wekan with scripts that has these environment variables\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#run-wekan-manually-if-youve-built-for-production\nAnd in that script start wekan with command meteor .\nIn OpenVZ it can also be that docker version does not work.. Yes please add results of your manual install. Also Sandstorm (where Wekan is also available) does not work in OpenVZ:\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/2799. You need to install Node.js first.\nI think Meteor install script asks for privileges if it needs them.. Required version are mentioned at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile\nNode 4.8.4\netc. I think sed tried to replace in this file\n~/repos/wekan/packages/meteor-useraccounts-core/package.js. Yes, when it gives error. I'll try to make working install script for Ubuntu 16.04 when I have more time.. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/30. Moved to #802. @danielmhair \n1. \nMeteor etc frameworks used bring so much functionality, that way actual Wekan code is only about 9000 lines. I'm not sure is meteor style code replaceable with Vanilla Javascript or Typescript.\nI would recommend that you start with adding info to Developer Documentation about Wekan directory structure, inner workings etc, so there would sometime be enough info to actually do some replacement. Currently we have only done incremental improvements, because original author of Wekan already got tired trying to reimplement Wekan, so I needed to continue as a new maintainer. I would recommed you to think how much time you have available.\n2.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#api\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/labels/API%3AREST. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. @adamhovorka \nYou could run 2 different Wekan Docker containers that have different ROOT_URL and use same MongoDB database.\n. @adamhovorka \nIs there different IP address or URL that is shown for VPN users and LAN users? Does that server has multiple IP addresses? Usually when I use VPN I can access same LAN IP addresses as at the office LAN.\nIs there some server like Nginx or Caddy in front of Wekan Docker container?. @adamhovorka \nI think you don't need multiple copies of Wekan running.\nYou need 2 nameservers: one for your LAN, and one for your VPN. Configure your computers to use those nameservers in computer or LAN/VPN DNS settings.\nOn nameservers, setup http://yourserver domain name (name that you made up, not real domain at internet) to point to your server where Wekan is in address http://yourserver/wekan address. LAN nameserver has http://yourserver domain pointing to 192.168.x.x and VPN nameserver has http://yourserver domain pointing to 10.8.0.1.\nSetup Wekan ROOT_URL=http://yourserver/wekan\nSetup Wekan PORT=3000   (or some other port)\nSetup nginx proxy from http://yourserver/wekan to localhost port 3000 .\nThis way you could also have names to your other servers, no need to use IP addresses.\nTell me does this work for you.. @janisroze \nYou have unsupported version of Node in use, you may experience 100% CPU usage etc problems. Check versions at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile\nRelated #1141 #912.

I do have colors visible below text Select Color.\nMaybe you don't have ROOT_URL setup properly?\nWhat commands you used to build from source?. @janisroze \nDid you try those tips above? Are you still stuck on this?. Only en.i18n.json is updated with pull requests when adding new features.\nOther translations are done at Transifex:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/\nThanks! :). @ocdtrekkie \nDoes this bug still exist ?. Discussion moved to #876 . Everybody:\nPlease continue discussion at #876 .\nDo not add comments to this already merged pull request.. @ryangorley \nPlease test newest Wekan. Is this already fixed?. Wekan website  shows this original logo @mquandalle bought as mentioned at #64\n\nBut in that same issue #64 there is also new icon by @neynah , icon is used at Sandstorm etc and has svg in meta directory and it's actually currently the official logo:\n\nIn official icon, Wekan is shortened to We, to make icon more readable. I think new wider logo should have full name Wekan, and have design like in official logo.  I don't know yet how to improve excellent work by @neynah .. @neynah \nFiles can be attached to this issue in .zip archive.. I tried to edit logo, I had it looking something like this before Inkscape crashed and I lost my vector graphics edits. I'm don't often edit vector graphics so I'm not so good with it.\n\nIt would be very helpful if someone would create something like this logo with proper dimensions for Wekan in SVG format and attach to this issue in .zip file.. @neynah \nThanks, looks great!. @neynah \nPlease include also your .ai file, because I was unable to open that .svg file in Inkscape for editing.. I added new logo to Wekan website, what do you all think?\nhttps://wekan.github.io. @neynah \nCan you include your .ai file of new Wekan logo in .zip file please ?. @DukeW \nIt's possible to change you as board admin at MongoDB database, that link is mentioned at Platforms page. There is no Web UI for it yet. I have not tried can it be done with REST API.\nMoved to #802. Moved to #802 . Moved to:\n1) Full text search #552\n2) Scheduled activity #1160.

Uploading files crashes with MongoDB 3.4.x.\nWhat file type you have problems with?. @nztqa \nWhen I tried this, card content (description, images, checklists etc) were not copied to new card anymore. Only card name was copied.\nYou could try to look at move card code how it does work moving everything, if something similar could be done to copy card.. I did copy it to different list than the original list. It did not work for me in that case.. @nztqa \nWhen I don't add your pull request code, and copy card to same list, copied card cover can not be edited.\nWhen I add your pull request, and copy card to same list, card cover image attachment is not visible at all.\nI have these indexes, what should I do with these?

Thanks for explaining! :). @nztqa \nWekan already has setting to hide all system messages on board:\nTop right corner (your username) => Change Settings => Hide system messages\nOn your pull request, when slider is set to enabled, the state of slider is not saved. When I click same or different card, Hide system messages is not enabled anymore.. @nztqa \nWith your code when I:\n- click first card\n- click slider to hide messages\n- close card\n- open second card\nthen messages are not hidden, like in first card. Setting is not saved.\nThis menu option:\nTop right corner (your username) => Change Settings => Hide system messages\nshould be removed, and only the slider in cards should be used to have the same functionality as Hide system messages. This way the feature is also available in Sandstorm, where top right menu is not shown, but board menu and card functionality etc is shown.\nCurrently Hide system messages works everywhere: cards, messages on right sidebar, etc.\nI have not checked is Hide system messages setting per board or per user. It should be per user.\nThanks! :). Thanks for explaining ! :). @ArcturusB\nI do have code to disable emojis, this would also fix related issues #743 #643 #323 where some others have asked a way to disable emojis. Some other emoji packages like emojione also break urls etc. Emojis could be added back sometime if somebody finds a way to use them without breaking something.. @erezeshkol @temperatio \nSorry, I need to revert #1232 that was added in https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1241 , it still needs some work before adding it to Wekan. I will release Wekan v0.41 without it in near future.. @erezeshkol @temperatio \nThis is already fixed in wekanteam latest tag:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/wekanteam/wekan/tags/\nThe same will be availaibe as tag v0.41 when Docker Hub finishes building it.. @AustinDoolittle \nDoes #1228 help you in this? Are you trying to run Wekan behind some other webserver?. You should setup ROOT_URL to your full Wekan URL, not IP address URL.\nLike: http://hostname:81 or http://hostname:81/wekan. @soohwa \nWith this new pull request:\n- Wekan install with creating first user admin etc works\n- When I use REST API, it looks like it did create new user\n- But I can not login as new user with new user's username and password\nThanks, there's progress! :). @soohwa \nNow when I create new user with API, and login as new user, new user has admin rights. I tried to setup fromAdmin: false, but I did not yet find a way to create non-admin user. Is there a way, or can you add it?. Yes.\n1) I did create at Wekan webpage first user that became admin.\n2) Then I created new user with rest api.\n3) But new user has admin rights.\n4) How can I create normal user with rest api? User that doea not have admin rights?. @vgonzal \nDon't use mquandalle Docker image.\nUse this Docker compose script.\nAlso see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1254#issuecomment-332462216. @voicyfei \n1)  Backup your MongoDB data\n2) Cleanup and delete all Docker data to get Docker Compose working - only commands on that comment\n3) docker-compose up\n4) Restore MongoDB data, see 1)\n5) If you want to run docker-compose in background, press Ctrl-C and then\ndocker-compose up -d\n. Maybe someone could try to add this:\nhttps://github.com/saurabharch/push-rest. @yogi52 \nI don't know how browser notification works on Sandstorm, is it possible for Wekan to send those. Maybe @kentonv knows?. Moved to #2026. @MehdyAmazigh \nUpgrade to your VB release to latest https://wekan.xet7.org\nYou could try something similar like at #1228 if pound has ability to proxy to other localhost port. I'm not familiar with pound.\nIf you are using VB release, then change Wekan to use some other port than 80.\nFor using hostnames like https://yourserver in local network, add server ip address and hostname to your /etc/hosts or similar hosts file on your operating system.\nVirtualBox scripts are also at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/tree/master/virtualbox. @LeJav\nDo you use this recommended Nginx config ?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config\nAnd Docker production settings?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-Docker-in-production\n. @LeJav \nThanks :)\n@MehdyAmazigh \nIf you still have this issue with newest Wekan, please reopen issue.. Please change:\n- notice => announcement everywhere in your code, filenames and translations, so it's consistent\n- in Admin Panel texts to: Announcement, Active System-Wide Announcement, Announcement from Administrator. @nztqa \nPlease make it possible to:\n- by default: admins and normal users can create and edit labels\n- optional setting in board menu (right menu 2nd from top) so it will be visible on Sandstorm: only admin user create and edit labels. @andresmanelli \nPlease add new wiki page for Webhook documentation similar that there is for REST API with examples how your feature works with these new features.\nPlease also add link to that documentation page to Features page Webhooks\nThen I can test this and add this to Wekan.. This is already fixed.. @keekeiz \nFor compatibility with Exchange, you can use Davmail:\nhttp://davmail.sourceforge.net/\nWekan SMTP => Davmail => Exchange. @johnleeming @vrms @neufeind \nDo you have screenshots or mockups what those suggested features should look like?  Do you have some kanban method or use case in mind?\nIdea of horizontal view has been discussed before but nobody has implemeted it yet.. @rgalonso \nFor this issue about adjustable width, your PR did work. I was only confused about calendar issue. Adjustable width could be added as alternative option. Comments, anyone?\n. @Turlin666 \nI think this is not currently possible.\n1) When I add this markdown to card description:\n[Test](file:///home/user/Documents/index.html)\n2) And click Test link, it has URL of of the card, not of the file.\nWekan also has some CSRF and/or XSS protection so this could be the reason also.\nTo make it kind of work, you would need to have some local webserver with the files, so files would have http or https url, like http://LOCAL-SERVER-IP-ADDRESS/files/test.txt. It's already possible to list private boards of user with API:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API#information-about-boards-of-user. \n. @ertanalytics \nThere is already a way to Import and Export Wekan board to and from JSON at Sandstorm Wekan, when you click board menu (hamburger icon, 3 lines) and click there Import or Export. But I don't know how to do this with API.\nTrello import on Sandstorm Wekan does not import attachments yet, because Wekan does not have Sandstorm compatible access to outside of grain. Importing Trello attachments works on Standalone Wekan (like Docker etc) and then you can export Wekan JSON that includes attachments in JSON as Base64 encoded, and then import that Wekan JSON to Sandstorm with attachments in JSON.. @ertanalytics \nWhat version of Wekan you have on Sandstorm? Have you updated to latest? I have 0.47.0\nWhen updating, also update all your grains.\nPlease include your Sandstorm Wekan grain console logs so I can see exact errors.. Is it only error with this Wekan grain?\nCan you export some other Wekan grain?. I added this info to Wekan wiki\nExporting Wekan board to JSON file with Bash script\n1) On Wekan grain, get Webkey like this:\nhttps://api-URL.SUBDOMAIN.sandcats.io#APIKEY\n2) Modity URL, SUBDOMAIN and APIKEY to this Bash script that exports board to file directly:\ncurl https://Bearer:APIKEY@api-URL.SUBDOMAIN.sandcats.io/api/boards/sandstorm/export?authToken=#APIKEY > wekanboard.json. I think I could try to fix this by exposing /api at sandstorm-pkgdef.capnp file when I get some free time.. @ertanalytics \nNo idea. Maybe in near or distant future.. @ertanalytics \nAs you can see from these IRC chatlogs, only @kentonv is currently able to build Sandstorm from source, because he made changes how Sandstorm was built:\nhttps://botbot.me/freenode/sandstorm/2018-02-11/?tz=Europe/Helsinki\nI don't know are there pull request to documentation yet.\nI also have not yet figured out all steps yet.. @ertanalytics \nProbably these fixes to build script were recently merged:\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/pull/3034. @ertanalytics \nAdd new issue to Sandstorm if you still have problems:\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues. @ertanalytics \nAnd also add info to this issue if you get Sandstorm built, and how you did it.. @ertanalytics \nI added issue to Sandstorm, I still have problems.\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/3036. Install instructions included at Sandstorm repo should now work also for you.\nYou can see changed merged pull requests about Docs fixes at https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\nSo you can clone that repo and follow instructions. It should work OK.. Requirements:\n1) Add cards  - including specific labels, descriptions, checklists.\n2) Move cards - from one list to another.\n3) Remove members - from the entire board.\n4) Change assignment - Assign certain members to certain cards or remove them.. Current data extraction is done with this:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Wekan-Sandstorm-cards-to-CSV-using-Python. Progress:\n1) Add cards - including specific labels, descriptions, checklists.\nI tried adding apiPath to Wekan similar to this way:\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-generic-rest-app/blob/master/sandstorm-pkgdef.capnp#L58-L59\nHere is some examples of permissions and roles:\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/auth/#defining-permissions-and-roles\nWekan has a way to update existing card with REST API https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1037#issuecomment-301271356\nat Standalone Wekan like this:\nPUT /api/boards/:boardId/lists/:listId/cards/:cardId\nI did get board, list and card IDs from Sandstorm board exported Wekan JSON file.\nThen I tried updating card this way:\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer APIKEY\" \\\n     -H \"Content-type:application/json\" \\\n     -X PUT \\\n     https://Bearer:APIKEY@api-APIURL.SUBDOMAIN.sandcats.io/api/boards/sandstorm/lists/LIST-ID/cards/CARD-ID \\\n     -d '{ \"title\": \"Testing title of card 1\", \"description\": \"Some description about card\", \"authorId\": \"WEKAN-USER-ID\" }'\nThen I get this error in Wekan grain debug log:\nError: Unauthorized [Unauthorized]\n    at Object.Authentication.checkUserId (server/authentication.js:12:21)\n    at models/cards.js:521:20\n    at packages/simple_json-routes.js:98:9\nThis means that I did not get syntax errors anymore like with previous curl tests I did, so syntax is OK, but there could be some double login issue, or I just have not logged in properly yet.. Maybe it's just API authentication issue like @kentonv said at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1279#issuecomment-334987880 . I'll look at API authentication code.. About exporting Wekan board with API:\n- at Sandstorm hosted Wekan that was accepted by @ocdtrekkie : export with API works\n- on my own sandcats.io server: export with API does not work\n- on local Sandstorm Wekan with meteor-dev: export with API does not work\nWhen I disable that authentication code at server/authentication.js:12:21 above, then API just does not work. That means, that API does not give correct result like exporting board or changing card, it just gives back Wekan frontpage html source.\n@kentonv \nDo you have any idea why this happens? This makes even testing API hard.\nThere has been changes in Wekan that some of the API like checklists does not work, but it would be nice to even have API working locally.\nI have also tried to uncommend admin permission code at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/sandstorm-pkgdef.capnp#L182-L188\nand also adding apiPath, but those did not make anything work.\nI'm still new to all this how permissions at Sandstorm works, but I'm trying to figure this out, as it would help many Wekan users, including my clients, that are stuck at this currently.. @kentonv\nProblem is still in authorization code at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1279#issuecomment-377693993 in wekan/server/authentication.js:12:21. I did try to add checking for sandstorm id, etc, and those checks seem to pass ok. But then comes the actual check of authorization place in that line 12, and I could not yet figure out how to make it happy with sandstorm id and pass that authorization check.\nSomewhere else was some code comment, that Wekan at Sandstorm runs like admin user of standalone Wekan. I have not yet looked more closely about permissions implementation in Wekan and Sandstorm.. @ertanalytics \nOn short term, it's possible to export data to Standalone Wekan:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-from-Wekan-Sandstorm-grain-.zip-file\nIn long term, there will be performance improvements to Wekan, those are at roadmap.. @ertanalytics \nYes, I should fix Sandstorm API, when I get some free time. Sorry it's taking so long.. @ertanalytics \nCan you test:\n- make backup of all grains\n- upgrade to newest Wekan\n- is there any difference?. @ertanalytics \nPlease test Wekan Sandstorm version v1.39, it has speedups, does it help enough with performance?. @ertanalytics \nExport using Wekan board hamburger menu / Export still works, so API is enabled on on Wekan side. I know this, because if at Standalone Wekan WITH_API=false, Exporting board at Wekan menu does not work, but gives similar HTML output like you have above. That settings WITH_API=true is at code here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/sandstorm-pkgdef.capnp#L240\nI don't know what effect did addition of /api by @ocdtrekkie do:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/sandstorm-pkgdef.capnp#L229\n@kentonv \nDoes Sandstorm API still work? Or did some update disable it?. I only tested at sandstorm.io though. I'll test at something.sandcats.io next.. I tested something.sandcats.io , created webkey etc, it's the same. Export using API does not work. Export using Wekan menu does work. Something prevents calling API.. @ocdtrekkie \n/api/api and /api/api/api did not work yet in rest api. I try modifying sandstorm-pkgdef.capnp file.. Wekan is at official store, without ?experimental=true in url. I think there is no experimental currently. If official also does not work, it's more likely Sandstorm bug.\n@kentonv What do you think?. I got API working in Wekan release I will make soon.\nAPI works this way:\n1) Make API key, and from that key copy API URL and API KEY to below. It saves Wekan board to file.\ncurl http://Bearer:APIKEY@api-12345.local.sandstorm.io:6080/api/boards/sandstorm/export?authToken=#APIKEY > wekanboard.json\n2) If later API key does not work, you need to remove it and make a new one.. @karacsg\nTry dropping mongodb database while restoring:\nmongorestore --drop. Yes. Wekan does not support MongoDB 3.4.x, because uploading images will then crash Wekan.\nWekan only supports MongoDB 3.2.x.. @karacsg \nDid you install Wekan from source to new server, could there be problem in that?\nCan you try Docker Compose version and restore your data there?. @karacsg \nAlso after you have made backup of old server MongoDB, could you try new Wekan on old server with old MongoDB database and try to export data to Wekan JSON ?. Yes you can try locally with that Docker MongoDB 3.4.x if it's possible to export to JSON there.. Wekan is only compatible with MongoDB 3.2.x, that does still receive updates to new versions.\nWe welcome all code contributions and bounties for fixing it.\nIt looks like having MongoDB 3.4 work is not at Roadmap or BountySource yet. So all of those are to be done before trying to have MongoDB 3.4 work.. Moved to #1522. Wekan only supports Node v4.8.4, MongoDB 3.2.x etc as mentioned in wekan/wekan repo Dockerfile.\nAlso see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1210. @uusijani \nDescription has markdown support, so if you want to use preformatted text, use 3 backticks above and below preformatted text.\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code\nRelated https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/926. Wekan currently uses perak:markdown@1.0.5\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/.meteor/versions#L120\nIt's maybe here:\nhttps://github.com/perak/markdown\nSomeone needs to check what that markdown currently supports and are there additional features to enable somehow.. @mayjs @huneau\nDo you have idea about this?. Recently Wekan got feature that user can leave board:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v048-2017-10-09-wekan-release\nFeature request for Teams/Organizations #802 includes request for:\n- Admin Panel: Add/Modify/Remove Teams/Users/Passwords. There was some discussion earlier that it would be good to be able to cleanup users etc on Sandstorm also. There are also some regulations like GDPR that require possibility to remove all data of person.. I think it's good idea that if there's something broken in MongoDB data, Wekan should be able to fix it and continue working by itself.. IANAL, but...\nAFAIK currently Trello is only available on USA servers, so some at Europe are looking at migrating to something like Wekan to be GDPR compliant. It will be seen does Atlassian/Trello plan to have servers at EU.\nUser needs to be able to download all his/her data (in common formats like JSON etc) that some company has on their servers, and also ability to get it deleted in some timeframe. Except for tax data, goverment data, bank info etc. So this is mainly for commercial businesses that have customer data, not for private persons. There are monetary sanctions for those that are not compliant.\nIn one GDPR talk where I was there was said that deleting info means for all data, in any files, including data in all emails, although that gets complicated when there's many receivers, I have not checked newest info about those.\nFor Wekan, it mostly means that:\n- Data encryption #890 is important\n- Offline use of Standalone Wekan is important, and it works already\n- Sandstorm working at offline LAN is important. I did not yet look how to use Sandstorm apps JSON file to download all new apps and update Sandstorm offline. I have run Wekan offline in dev mode, but I don't know is normal mode available offline. Normal install did seem to require open ports and sandcats.io cert.\n- Support for offline mode #466 and online sync is important\n- Currently Wekan is already used to store patient HIPPA data etc as was seen at Hacker News article, etc critical offline data. This brings question about how safe data is at MongoDB, can it be recovered, or could for example SQLite and other databases be used instead. I did not have much success recovering corrupted MySQL data from raw files. There have been some cases that Wekan grains at Sandstorm have been corrupted, I don't know is this because of filesystem corruption on ext4, or could for example ZFS or btrfs be better. Or alternatively some distributed databases that has multiple copies of data, like CockroachDB etc - I have not looked at those yet.\nAnyway I presume Wekan usage will grow :). @ocdtrekkie \nI think we don't need to worry to so much detail, it depends on each Wekan admin's situation and what they need to do. We just make possible to use GUI and API to find, add, edit and delete data, and have some permission settings.. If someone want's to take security to extreme with Wekan with encryption #890 then each users data could be separately encrypted with time-limited keys on hardened operating systems etc.. @soohwa \nIs this now fixed with your pull request of disable/enable user? I merged it to devel a moment ago.. @soohwa \nCould you add those options to API ?. @soohwa \nI don't know about any default for board. I would prefer implementation of all 3 options, and have a choise what to do.. @wiltonsr \nPlease add translations at Transifex where Wekan translations are done:\nhttps://transifex.com/wekan/wekan\nOnly new features have changes to english language using pull requests.. @soohwa \nMore details? Prettier how?. @soohwa \nDid you fix this in https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1323 ?. This?\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/09/navigator-share. I hope most required functionality can be made with in-browser, because otherwise it's much fighting with appstore approval processes etc.. Yes, plan is that it's possible to do same things with Web UI and API.. Heh, I have not decided anything. We still welcome all contributions like native apps, as can be seen at https://github.com/wekan/android-native/issues/1 . It's just that nobody has volunteered to help with native app yet, and for me it's easier to start with improving mobile web experience than implement everything from scratch on mobile app.. I have not yet tested manifest at mobile web yet. It already works at desktop webbrowser.. Thanks!. I prefer Open Source tools, not zapier.\nCurrent way to do this would be:\n1) Have Huginn #1160 read email from somewhere.\n2) Have Huginn use Wekan API to add text to Wekan.. Translations are done in Transifex, please add changes there:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan\nOnly English changes come with pull requests when adding new features.\nThanks!. @GavinLilly \nThanks a lot for tracking this down this bug!\nFixing this would probably also help with Wekan on Sandstorm, because we are currently tracking down bug why Wekan grain does not start on Sandstorm. There has also been couple of cases where Wekan grain on Sandstorm gets \"corrupted\" and does not work anymore. I hope fixing this will help in all those cases.\nWe will try to fix this in near future.. @nztqa \nWould it be possible to somehow catch the error before Wekan crashes and delete the corresponding document from the cfs.attachments.filerecord collection ?.  @chromas-cro \nWhat web font does show Polish correctly? At some other webpage? URL ?. I am unable to duplicate this on Ubuntu 14.04.\nYou probably don't have some font installed.\n\n. Thanks!\nI use GitHub \"Watch\" repo feature so I do get emails from all new issues, comments etc, I do read everything.. @centigrade-thomas-becker \nPlease try latest version 0.50 first.. I think I fixed something related to this sometime.. @GhassenRjab \nCan you look at this?. @thibaultgaillard \nI was not able to reproduce this. In standalone Wekan, I exported Wekan JSON, and had no avatars added, it did work. Also adding avatar to some user, when another one did not have avatar.. @wenerme \nWhy don't you use ready-made Docker image of Wekan that already works?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-Docker-in-production\nAFAIK There's problems running Docker and Meteor.js based software like Wekan in Alpine.. @wenerme \nIs it possible to use Alpine-based Wekan Docker image with ArangoDB ?\nReplacing MongoDB with ArangoDB ?\nDo you have Docker Compose file for it, similar like this ?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. @wenerme \nYour fix is now merged to Wekan devel branch, and will be merged to master later and be included in Wekan by default.. Wekan is only compatible with MongoDB 3.2.x etc versions mentioned in Wekan Git repo Dockerfile.\nUsing MongoDB 3.4.x causes crash when uploading file.. Showing running docker containers and container IDs:\ndocker ps\nShowing Docker logs:\ndocker logs CONTAINER-ID\n. docker-compose.yml file has many comments how to setup mail etc:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. Did you invite some user so that mail is sent? Or how it does not work?. Please add your error message :). What SMTP server are you using?. Does your email server use SSL at all ?\nFor Exchange DavMail can be used:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. Please change to have correct syntax:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L71-L83\nSSL means that mail url starts with smtps , and port 25 is unencrypted email, you need to change it to correct SSL port.. Same settings also need to be in Admin Panel. Yes. That shoud be:\n--env='MAIL_URL=smtp://wekan:password@server.company.local:25' . With that kind of username, you really need to urlencode it, like with https://www.urlencoder.org/\n--env='MAIL_URL=smtp://wekan%40server.company.local:password@server.company.local:25' \\\n. @ChristopherM87 \nAre you starting Docker container with commandline? Or docker-compose.yml ? Can you add that whole text how you start Wekan, without passwords.. @ChristopherM87 \nI did today some STARTTLS debugging, and got it working with following, you can test:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail#starttls-sending-test-email-failed. You can already add two factor auth with Google Auth by having Nginx => ProxyBouncer Google Auth => Wekan.\nOn standalone Wekan this does mean 2 steps:\n1) Login with Google Auth\n2) Login with Wekan username and password\nOn Sandstorm there is only one step login.\nMoved to #234\n. @amadilsons\nCan you look at this?. @amadilsons\nCan you look at this?. What hints?\nAfter registering you can login at url /sign-in. Original English strings at en.i18n.json needs fixing and being more descriptive, so they can be translated better. Translation files are here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/i18n\nWhen there is new features and additions git repo en.18n.json, I push changes to Transifex, make my Finnish etc translations, and pull all translations back to git repo. There has been cases before where I have made fixes to original English file.. Would it be easier to translate if I move translations from Transifex to something like Pontoon?\nPontoon has demo site at https://pontoon.mozilla.org and docs at https://mozilla-pontoon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html \nI could make website that has all Wekan screens like All Boards, Board, Admin Panel, etc.\nThen click some text for example at Admin Panel, and translate in-place.\nI have not tested this yet.. @brooksbecton \nYou can add some Meteor PDF package:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/pascoual/pdfjs?q=pdf\nFor example for viewing:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/pascoual/pdfjs\nThose files need to be included in Wekan, they can not be online outside dependencies, because Wekan is also used offline.\nSome of those PDF packages can also generate PDF files, that would be handy if somebody wants to print Wekan board. There is probably feature request for that in issues already, but it's not implemented.\nI don't know are there solutions for viewing other file types than images and PDF.. I would recommend someone interested in this just looking at code and trying to add viewing pdf files. Related files are here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/client/components/cards. @jenbrody \nThis bug is still in Wekan, it's on Roadmap to be fixed.. @jenbrody \nAbout one week to one month, something in between.. @neufeind \nAnybody interested in this can already implement this without changes to Wekan.\nIn database, have table with these 2 rows:\n- card url\n- ticket number\nUse IFTTT with Huginn of Flogo to make REST API.calls etc triggers to both ticketing system and Wekan, like adding ticket number to Wekan card, changing status etc.\nIf somebody tries to implement this, and something is not yet possible with REST API, add question about it to this issue.. Moved to #1160. @dudasfau\nPlease use Google search etc to look for various Open Source projects that use Trello API for import and export, and list those projects here. Also please check do you have access to Company Trello API.\nCurrently Wekan has only import from Trello, not export back to Trello and not sync with Trello.\nTrello also has features that Wekan does not have, and Wekan has features that Trello does not have. So if somebody would implement sync back to Trello, it would only work for features that both have in common.. Starting points to any interested contributor that would like to send PR:\n- https://github.com/DataFire/DataFire\n- https://github.com/DataFire/Integrations\n- Related: OneDB database UI, maybe add to Admin Panel? https://github.com/DataFire/OneDB. - Trello API https://developers.trello.com/reference\n- Wekan OpenAPI https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1965#issuecomment-455606651 , that will be later added to https://wekan.github.io/api/ or alternatively https://api.wekan.team , depending what would be preferred URL.\n- Wekan API login with form data, other calls with JSON\n- Example sync Wekan <=> Gogs at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs. I renamed this to Bitbucket login.\nSandstorm Wekan already has passwordless email/Google/GitHub/SAML/LDAP login, and user admin.\nStandalone Wekan feature requests:\n- Google/GitHub auth #234 \n- Teams/Organizations/User admin #802 that is also at Roadmap. Thanks! I merged it manually, because that file had changed after your pull request.. Moved to here from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1391\nFrom @ocdtrekkie \n\nI am not super fond of this change. It takes up like an inch and a half, since the current \"Add attachment\" button is a giant box. It pushes the most recent comment to nearly always be below the scroll point.\nIs it possible we could shorten how large this section is if there's no attachments, while still making the Attachments section visible all the time?\nI understand why. But as someone who rarely uses attachments in Wekan, the change has a very painful cost. I am not personally comfortable trying to improve it myself, but hoping perhaps my suggestion on how it can be improved might be useful to the person who made the PR.\n\nQuestion to all: \nShould there be slider for hiding attachment box? Or how should it work?. @iooner\nWhat is custom oAuth?. Moved to #1324. @thuanpq \nWekan releases happen multiple times a day to once a month, it depends on my free time.\nTesting pull requests also takes time, I add questions to pull requests when needed.. @GhassenRjab \nYes you are right. I will merge this and add fixed lines by @thuanpq . https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#when-new-version-of-wekan-will-be-released-when-my-pull-request-will-be-tested-commented-or-merged. @ocdtrekkie \nYes, I added making a bot to Roadmap.. Standalone Wekan seems to work on Node 6.12 and Meteor 1.6, still using MongoDB 3.2.18.\nThis does not fix crash bug when uploading image or file when using MongoDB 3.4.x\nCurrent code is at meteor-1.6 branch:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/meteor-1.6\nAnd code build script for Meteor 1.6 version is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/rebuild-wekan-meteor-1.6.sh\nThis Node 6.12/Meteor 1.6 version does not yet work on Sandstorm:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sandstorm-dev/wzZkXlTnuQw\nPlease test and report any problems. I don't know how this affects performance etc, as there has been  performance fixes, I merged 2nd one some hours ago https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1373 by @mfshiu . \nI probably also provide Docker version of this Meteor 1.6 Wekan in near future.. I did update Dockerfile and add that meteor-1.6 tag to Docker Hub, automatic build could take one hour, and then it will appear to:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/wekanteam/wekan/tags/\nIt can be tested with similar Docker Compose script like at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb , just change wekanteam/wekan:latest tag to wekanteam/wekan:meteor-1.6\n. @ocdtrekkie \n1) MongoDB version is 3.2.18.

Could this be related? https://github.com/auth0/lock/issues/112. Ok, I'm reading https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki/API-changes-between-v0.6-and-v0.8. The problem was that Meteor 1.6.1 upgrade broke Wekan. So when I went back to Meteor 1.6.0 then I was able to upgrade to Node 6.12.2. I did test 8.8.1 but it did not work yet. Continuing upgrades.... Sorry I needed to go back to Meteor 1.4 and Node 4.8.4 because upgrades broke Docker/Snap/Sandstorm builds.. @snowyurik found the code at #1409 that has problems on Meteor 1.6 and Node 8.8.1. This error is with Wekan in general, it's not specific to FreeBSD.\nAt wekan/models/attachments.js with Node 6.12.2 console shows both console log messages I added before and after attachment problem, and Wekan works. With Node 8.8.1 there is only first console log message \"before attachment problem\", and then Wekan web interface does not load at all.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/models/attachments.js#L1-L26\n```\nconsole.log('before attachment problem');\nAttachments = new FS.Collection('attachments', {\n  stores: [\n// XXX Add a new store for cover thumbnails so we don't load big images in\n// the general board view\nnew FS.Store.GridFS('attachments', {\n  // If the uploaded document is not an image we need to enforce browser\n  // download instead of execution. This is particularly important for HTML\n  // files that the browser will just execute if we don't serve them with the\n  // appropriate `application/octet-stream` MIME header which can lead to user\n  // data leaks. I imagine other formats (like PDF) can also be attack vectors.\n  // See https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/99\n  // XXX Should we use `beforeWrite` option of CollectionFS instead of\n  // collection-hooks?\n  // We should use `beforeWrite`.\n  beforeWrite: (fileObj) => {\n    if (!fileObj.isImage()) {\n      return {\n        type: 'application/octet-stream',\n      };\n    }\n    return {};\n  },\n}),\n\n],\n});\nconsole.log('after attachment problem');\n```\n@kentonv Do you have ideas about this?. @kentonv \nHow would I wrap it with try/catch? Can you give an example?\nProcess keeps running and it does not give any error messages.. @kentonv \nI did get Standalone Wekan working with Meteor 1.6.0.1, Node 8.9.3, NPM 5.5.1 and fibers 2.0.0.\nI have your sandstorm.js capnp path fix applied.\nI did try to add capnp also manually because I got errors at Sandstorm with meteor-spk 4.0.0:\n```\n\ncapnp@0.2.0 install /home/wekan/repos/wekan/node_modules/capnp\nnode ./build.js\n\n(node:10280) [DEP0006] DeprecationWarning: child_process: options.customFds option is deprecated.

Anyway I'll push some crappy release to @ocdtrekkie for testing soon.. Sandstorm is now using Meteor 1.6.0.1 version, with Wekan v0.76 released today for Sandstorm and other platforms.\nUpgrades to Meteor 1.6.1 is separate issue https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9609 and would require a lot more work currently.. Moved to #1499. I'm in progress of merging this manually, no need fix this yet.. After merging manually, and disabling card deletion, normal user can not add cards. Maybe I messed up something while trying to merge manually. \nPlease get latest wekan/wekan devel branch, add all your changes of this pull reques, close this pull request, and make new pull request to devel branch with only your changes. So that there is no my commits.. @thuanpq \nThis still contains my old unreleased git tag v0.53 etc. Please don't merge latest changes, but make a new pull request instead.. Moved to #786. Some of this already exists at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs , needs checking.. I have now signed the CLA.. @thuanpq \nPlease get latest wekan/wekan devel branch, add all your changes of this pull reques, close this pull request, and make new pull request to devel branch with only your changes.

Yes, because normally you archive card so you can restore it back. Deleting can not be undone, more clicks are by design. There was previously easily clicked button to delete a list and people deleted important list by accident, and that bug report was fixed.. If you want to delete cards faster, drag cards to new list, and delete that new list.. Merged manually to original pull request.. @thuanpq \nDisable Card Deleting: As normal user, there is still delete link visible on card and arhived card, it should be hidden.\nDisable Card Restoring: As normal user, there is still restore link visible on arhived card, it should be hidden.\nWhen Disable Card Deleting is selected, I get this error to node.js console:\nException while invoking method '/cards/remove' TypeError: Cannot read property 'isBoardAdmin' of undefined\n    at Cards.allow.remove (models/cards.js:91:115)\n    at packages/allow-deny/allow-deny.js:396:13\n    at Array.every (native)\n    at [object Object].CollectionPrototype._validatedRemove (packages/allow-deny/allow-deny.js:395:37)\n    at [object Object].m.(anonymous function) (packages/allow-deny/allow-deny.js:173:46)\n    at packages/check.js:130:16\n    at [object Object]._.extend.withValue (packages/meteor.js:1122:17)\n    at Object.exports.Match._failIfArgumentsAreNotAllChecked (packages/check.js:129:41)\n    at maybeAuditArgumentChecks (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:1734:18)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:719:19\n    at [object Object]._.extend.withValue (packages/meteor.js:1122:17)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:717:40\n    at [object Object]._.extend.withValue (packages/meteor.js:1122:17)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:715:46\n    at [object Object]._.extend.protocol_handlers.method (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:689:23)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:559:43\nWhen Disable Card Restoring is selected, I get this error to node.js console:\nException while invoking method '/cards/remove' TypeError: Cannot read property 'isBoardAdmin' of undefined\n    at Cards.allow.remove (models/cards.js:91:115)\n    at packages/allow-deny/allow-deny.js:396:13\n    at Array.every (native)\n    at [object Object].CollectionPrototype._validatedRemove (packages/allow-deny/allow-deny.js:395:37)\n    at [object Object].m.(anonymous function) (packages/allow-deny/allow-deny.js:173:46)\n    at packages/check.js:130:16\n    at [object Object]._.extend.withValue (packages/meteor.js:1122:17)\n    at Object.exports.Match._failIfArgumentsAreNotAllChecked (packages/check.js:129:41)\n    at maybeAuditArgumentChecks (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:1734:18)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:719:19\n    at [object Object]._.extend.withValue (packages/meteor.js:1122:17)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:717:40\n    at [object Object]._.extend.withValue (packages/meteor.js:1122:17)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:715:46\n    at [object Object]._.extend.protocol_handlers.method (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:689:23)\n    at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:559:43\nControl Panel => Settings => General: It's not descriptive enough text.

Also move there those Disable Card Deleting and Disable Card Restoring.. @thuanpq \nYou can also try to add your changes to this PR, because there is no merge conflicts currently like in previous PR.. @thuanpq\nActually new PR is better, because I have already made many changes and added new release tag etc. Thanks !. @thuanpq \nYou don't need to change this menu option name:\nControl Panel => Settings => Registration\nThanks :). @thuanpq \nOk, then Self-Registration would be better I think.. That way slider would be much harder to find when it's needed.. @nztqa \nPlease add second one as pull request to devel branch. Thanks!. @huneau \nDo you have idea how to fix these npm lint errors as you wrote the original pull request ?\n/home/travis/build/wekan/wekan/server/logger.js\n  14:13  warning  'loggers' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  17:13  warning  'loggers' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  20:9   error    'loggers' is not defined             no-undef\n  27:9   error    'loggers' is not defined             no-undef\n  44:9   error    'loggers' is not defined             no-undef. Only errors need to be fixed. Warnings are OK. I'm testing your changes currently.. Actually, I currently have SMTP settings in Docker Compose file, and nothing set at Admin Panel, and it seems to work. I'll probably check this later.. @huneau\nIt seems that your Winston logger and logging used by pierreozoux has conflicts. So your Winston logger seems to be going away if you don't get these working in harmony. I will merge this soon, just a warning. . @huneau \nProblem is that Wekan demo keeps crashing, and it's very hard to debug without working logging.. I don't what kind of logs you all use. I added those I know to:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Logs. @thuanpq \nAs normal user I can still click List hamburger menu / More / Delete to delete card when in Admin Panel disable deleting is checked. That Delete link should not be visible when deleting is disabled.. @thuanpq \nCan you explain what is actual use case where this would be useful ?\nCurrently this is global Wekan settings. This means that when Wekan will have organizations and teams, this setting will disable restoring and deleting archived cards for all organizations.\nI would understand this better if this were per-board permission setting, but currently I'm not able to figure out the real purpose.\nI would recommend that you try to implement Organizations and Teams before continuing this, because then at Admin Panel could probably be some more logical place for this setting.. Moved to #1150. This not Wekan specific setting at all, it is impossible to implement. It is browser specific setting does browser keep cookies and other browsing history when browser is closed. If cookies are not kept, or cookies are emptied, you are logged out from all websites.\nTo not keep cookies etc browsing history, one way is to use private browsing mode in webbrowser:\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/269265/how-to-enable-private-browsing-on-any-web-browser/\nOther way is to configure webbrowser not to save any history at all, like cookies, browsing history, read webpages etc.  In Firefox:\nSettings / Security / History / Firefox saves: No history\nThere are similar settings or addons for Safari, Chrome etc browsers, those instructions can be found with for example Google search.. @nztqa \nIs it possible to change error to be shown directly on admin panel ?. @nztqa \nPlease add that alert code to this pull request.. @nztqa \nPlease make all user visible text, like Success, errors, email text, etc translateable, and add those changes to this pull request.. This is already fixed in Wekan v0.59 that can be used with build from source or docker hub tag.\nWekan uses MongoDB 3.2.x , you may have problems uploading images etc with MongoDB 3.4.x.\nAlso that new Node.js version could cause 100% CPU usage etc bugs.\nCheck wekan/wekan repo Dockerfile for versions currently in use.. Merged manually at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/7e4b42e9b3482460cac77a603809a8b5d4016477. I did merge manually at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/7e4b42e9b3482460cac77a603809a8b5d4016477 , not taking your time to clean up pull request etc. Thanks a lot !. Moved to #709. Moved to #1192. You have too new versions of Node, npm etc. See github repo Dockerfile for correct versions. Also I have not yet figured out dependencies, because I support Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 8 because of community request. Please use Docker version instead.. @gwir \n1) Setup ROOT_URL to your IP address at /home/wekan/repos/start-wekan.sh inside VM.\ncd repos\n./stop-wekan.sh\nnano start-wekan.sh\n2) Add have there your IP address, for example:\nexport ROOT_URL=http://192.168.1.100\nexport MAIL_URL=smtp://user:pass@mailserver.example.com:25/\nexport MAIL_FROM='Example Wekan Support <support@example.com>'\n3) Save with Ctrl-o Enter and after that exit with Ctrl-x\n4) Reboot VM.\n5) Access Wekan at your network with IP address of VM, for example\nAlso check that your VirtualBox VM network settings are in bridged mode, as described in VirtualBox VM download page.\nMore details of settings at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml\nHmm, maybe I need to add these to documentation to VM download page.. I added more details to bottom of VIrtualBox image download page.. @TNick \nThanks a lot ! I added it to wiki and made some additions etc.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Directory-Structure\nUpdates etc can be directly added to there.\nAlso if there is new pages to add, or ways to improve existing documentation at wiki, please make edits directly to wiki. Thanks!. Moved to #802. @thuanpq \nPlease add description where you did see this bug, with screenshots, I don't know what this fixes.. @thuanpq \nThis did seem to work cleanly, I did not see any errors, so I'm merging this, this most likely fixes some bug you did see.. @mfshiu \nCould you make new fork of Wekan devel branch, add your new changed files to that, and make new pull request? This pull request has a lot of old stuff like release v0.53 tag etc.. @mfshiu  \nI would also recommend fixing npm lint errors before committing etc:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Developer-Documentation#preventing-travis-ci-lint-errors-before-submitting-pull-requests. Actually, I think https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1373/commits/03ddd8e9ec13b7098412233988bb4a827c13d15e is the commit that is the main change in this. I'll try to test and merge it manually.. I merged this manually at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/233554a3d69f1cf3a509e540fc1623d17c357037 . Thanks!. @iwkse\nI don't have this bug in source install.\nI'll check is there something wrong in Docker version.\nWhat is your exact language code in your browser? Check it by clicking \"Run code snippet\" button at this page:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/8199760/how-to-get-the-browser-language-using-javascript\nIt could be like it-it or something else.. @iwkse \nPlease check Admin Panel / Version are you really running newest Wekan version 0.60.0. @iwkse \nI can not duplicate any problem with this. When there is Italian language selected, I get this email invitation:\nGentile user,\nxet7 ti ha invitato su Wekan per collaborare.\nPer favore segui il link qui sotto: http://192.168.123.123/sign-up\nIl tuo codice d'invito \u00e8: 123456\nGrazie.\n. Firefox.. With Chrome I also get invitation message in Italian.. @iwkse \nTry making backup, removing Wekan and MongoDB containers, starting Wekan again, and restoring data. I added more docs to:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb#upgrading-wekan. @romu70 \nYou probably use some MongoDB authentication URL for all your other products, so you need to setup environment variable to your existing MongoDB container before starting Wekan Docker container. Wekan can use any existing MongoDB inside or outside of Docker, just provide correct MongoDB URL to database name to use. So you only need to start Wekan Docker container.\nExamples:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/start-wekan.sh#L5\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L80\nStarting only Wekan container, example modified from without link to MongoDB container like at\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Docker\nso in this case you would use command line like this to run Wekan on port 8080, mapping to only localhost so port is not exposed to local network. If you would like to expose it to local network, add server IP address there. Then you would need to use some webserver like at Docker production setup to provide proxy to Wekan, look at Wekan GitHub wiki for configuration examples of various webservers. \nIf you use directly Wekan IP address and port at http://192.168.1.200:8080 at local network:\nbash\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wekan\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://192.168.1.200:8080\" -e \"PORT=8080\" -p 8080:80 wekanteam/wekan:latest\nIf you have some webserver at front of Wekan proxying to Wekan at localhost 8080, and have Nginx configured for example to http://192.168.1.200/wekan, you could use this:\nbash\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wekan\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://192.168.1.200/wekan\" -e \"PORT=8080\" -p 8080:80 wekanteam/wekan:latest\nIf you have some name in your LAN computers /etc/hosts files pointing to your local server IP address, like this line:\n192.168.1.200 wekan\nThen you could use url http://wekan to access local Wekan, having server_name wekan; in your nginx config, and start Wekan this way:\nbash\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wekan\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://wekan\" -e \"PORT=8080\" -p 8080:80 wekanteam/wekan:latest\n. @romu70\nIt seems that MongoDB connection string example is here:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/. @romu70 \nPlease reopen issue if you still have problems with this.. @romu70 \nContainer output means that connection to database was succesful and Wekan is able to save data to database.\nDo you have port 4300 open on your Synology NAS ?. You can see Docker logs by using container name or ID:\ndocker logs wekan-v0.60. Yes, going inside container:\ndocker exec -it wekan-v0.60 bash. To see running processes inside container:\ntop\nTo see what is on open port outside container, or some processes\nsudo netstat -plant | grep :4300\nsudo netstat -plant | grep node. I'm was the docker command syntax correct to open port correctly to outside container, you could compare it to how other docker contaieners are setup in your system, outside docker:\ndocker ps. Hmm, there is problem that inside container it goes to 4300 and not 80.\nTo fix it, remove inside port option this way:\n```\ndocker stop wekan-v0.60\ndocker rm wekan-v0.60\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-v0.60 -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://wekan:blablabla@mymongo_IP:27017/wekan\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://myserver_IP:4300\" -p 4300:80 wekanteam/wekan:v0.60\n. I would recommend that for docker image you use quay:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan\n```\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. @romu70 \nYou need to change Wekan ROOT_URL to https://tasks. @iwkse \nCan you provide pull request to Wekan devel branch?. @iwkse\nPlease add 2 separate pull requests of your latest suggestions:\n- more customized one\n- floats on the right etc\nI will test them.. Why? Boards subscription was moved in current place because of performance fix with large number of users https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1363. Actually, this could fix some bug you are seeing. I'll try to improve performance with upcoming other performance fix instead.. @mirkofetter \nCan you provide pull request to Wekan devel branch?. @mirkofetter \nEasiest is to use VirtualBox appliance https://wekan.xet7.org where all dependencies are already installed. There is  ~/repos/rebuild-wekan.sh script where you need to uncomment deleting ~/repos/wekan directory so your changes don't get lost.. @mirkofetter \nHave you looked at this?. Moved to #1160. @neurolabs \nYou can test it this way:\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan\ncd wekan\nedit docker-compose.yml to have this:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:devel\nAlso add email settings to docker-compose.yml.\nThen start Wekan in docker:\ndocker-compose up -d\nAnd then use webbrowser to go to http://localhost , register new account that will become admin.\nAlso see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Adding-users. @uusijani \nWorkaround as markdown:\n[v1.5.0](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/releases/tag/v1.5.0). This was previously fixed at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1073 , something has made it appear again.\nI'm not sure is this related to double slash regression on snap. @uusijani \nPlease test newest Ubuntu Snap, is double slash bug now fixed.\nIt seems to work for me.. @uusijani \nSorry, this should get it running at least on your own IP address:\n```\nmongodump --port 27019\nsudo snap remove wekan\nsudo snap install wekan\nsudo snap set wekan root-url=\"http://192.168.1.10\"       <== your IP address \nsudo snap set wekan port=\"80\"\nsudo systemctl restart snap.wekan.mongodb\nsudo systemctl restart snap.wekan.wekan\nmongorestore --drop --port 27019\n```\nI'll also continue testing this double slash fix myself.. With Nginx and Wekan at sub-url it works for me, there is no double slash bug, with Nginx and snap settings at this page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config. @ocdtrekkie \nThose changes have been made to make it faster to add a lot of attachments. If you have improvements to CSS, then submit pull request :). @ocdtrekkie \nDiscussion moved to #1328. @kubiko \nCan you look at this?. Yes, I'm in progress of fixing snap build script so I can release Wekan 0.62 snap version.. I failed to fix build script, so I posted https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/21 for @kubiko to help me.. Wekan v0.62 snap is now released, I fixed build script myself.. @lichtamberg \nIt's not possible for me to use Patreon.\nPlease send me private message at Vanila Chat ( my nickname there is xet7 ) to discuss other alternatives:\nhttps://chat.vanila.io/channel/wekan. 1) Install Docker for Mac  (Mac version includes Docker Compose)\nhttps://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#install-and-run-docker-for-mac\n2) Edit docker-compose.yml script to have ROOT_URL=192.168.1.200:3000 and PORT=3000   (your Mac IP address and port) and start it with instructions here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\n3) Your local Wekan is at http://192.168.1.200:3000 for example. Register your first user, it will become admin. You can ignore error about missing email settings. Then login with your username and password.\n. Pull requests welcome, if someone knows fix to this..

Moved to #119. @GavinLilly \nTry making yourself admin on that board: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1060#issuecomment-310545976. @GavinLilly \nI tried adding and removing members to card as admin and normal user, and it did work for me.\nCan you check you did not set your permissions as comment only?\nAre you able to move cards to other new board, does adding members on that other new board work?. @GavinLilly \nNo, I have not seen this before. I'm trying to google search what this means.. @GavinLilly \nIs this with any Outgoing Webhook?. Ok, so is this just misconfiguration and having a firewall.. @CodeBrauer \n\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1375\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-Docker-in-production. @CodeBrauer \n\nNo. You stop Wekan container, change ROOT_URL environment variable, and start Wekan container again.. @CodeBrauer \nDo you have Nginx webserver in front of Wekan?\nDid you start Docker with command line, or Docker Compose script?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. @CodeBrauer \nYou are linking to MongoDB v3.6.x documentation. Wekan only works with v3.2.x.. @CodeBrauer \nOk, I edited wiki.\nNext time you can add corrections etc directly to wiki.. @Michael2222 \ndocker-compose stop wekan-app\nThen change ROOT_URL in docker-compose.yml\ndocker-compose start wekan-app. @Michael2222 \nDo you mean latest Wekan docker-compose.yml with LDAP etc?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/LDAP. Please try with newest docker-compose.yml at Wekan repo:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/docker-compose.yml\nAdd your settings to it.. And try it with:\ndocker-compose up -d. @Logicbloke \nI tested this. This bug seems to happen only with Chrome. I don't remember having this bug before, has there been some update to Chrome that has broken this functionality?\nThere is no bug when I use Firefox.. I don't know could it be this feature:\nhttps://blog.google/products/chrome/taking-aim-annoying-page-jumps-chrome/\nhttps://blog.chromium.org/2017/04/scroll-anchoring-for-web-developers.html. @9a3eedi\nsudo snap set wekan root-url=\"http://192.168.0.51\"\nsudo snap set wekan port=\"80\"\nsudo systemctl restart snap.wekan.wekan\nThen go with webbrowser to http://192.168.0.51\n. @9a3eedi \nsudo snap set wekan root-url=\"http://192.168.0.51:80/wekan\"\nsudo snap set wekan port=\"80\"\nsudo systemctl restart snap.wekan.wekan. Yes this is normal.\nMoved to #1005\n. @GuillaumeAmat \nRemove Wekan Docker container and Docker image and reinstall it:\n```\ndocker-compose stop\ndocker rm wekan-app\ndocker rmi wekanteam/wekan\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\nThis does not touch MongoDB container where all data is. Sure you can first backup it, backup instructions are at Wekan GitHub wiki.. @a5dev \nNot currently. It's possible to use Commercial Support or add bounty to this:\nhttps://wekan.team\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/53104685-feature-request-change-email-notifications-subject\nOr someone can add pull request.. @snowyurik \nThis error is not specific to FreeBSD only, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1333#issuecomment-355756823\nThanks!. Moved to #1333. @BruceZCQ \nWekan crashes when uploading with MongoDB 3.4.x, it's a known problem. What version you use?\nWekan works only with MongoDB 3.2.x.. @BruceZCQ \nI sent email to indie.host asking for more information.. @pierreozoux\nDo you need fixes for Wekan?. @JamesLavin \nWhen copying/moving card, or import/export of wekan board, new label colors are not included.\nDirectory structure: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Directory-Structure\nMove/Copy card: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1330. @killua-eu \nYes you could try patching that. I can then try pull request again.. @rjevnikar \nI did reply to @JamesLavin above:\n\nWhen copying/moving card, or import/export of wekan board, new label colors are not included.\n\nSee:\n Import\n Import Wekan board\n Export Wekan board\n Migrations\n* Componets like labels etc\nWekan core really is well organized and easy to modify. I recommend just reading that code and trying modifications. Also see Developer Docs.. Already merged at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1679 and released in Wekan v1.03 today :). @neurokernel73 \nCheck where mongo is running:\nmeteor mongo -U\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22020580/how-to-connect-mongodb-clients-to-local-meteor-mongodb\nThere is no username and password used.\nThen connect to it with Metabase.. @neurokernel73 \nAre you looking at correct MongoDB database? In MongoDB tables are called collections.. Moved to #904. Moved to #904. This is already fixed.. Thanks! Original is most clearly understood for me.. Having more markdown support was added in v0.55 and is very cool feature, it makes possible very advanced formatting. Trello does not have that feature.\nSometime emoji support will be removed from Wekan, as it breaks displaying MAC addresses etc, and it's also possible to do emojis with unicode.\nI don't really know would it be possible to have markdown feature that can be turned on or off, or what should be detected in card, similar like in emoji detection, that some different kind of formatting would be used. With API and scripting or doing search-replace with text editor with exported JSON you could probably make many changes at once.. @p4t0g3n0 \nSet ROOT_URL to your server IP address or domain URL. @CodeBrauer \nYes, Meteor listens MongoDB changes and shows them near realtime.\nWekan plans for 2018:\nhttps://blog.wekan.team/2017/12/2-years-of-wekan-what-we-archieved/index.html\n- these do change and add to schema.\nI recommend you use Wekan REST API for direct changes to Wekan:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API\n- if something in REST API does not work yet, check if there is issues for it, or add new issue\nThis is used in Gogs integration:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs\nFor having Wekan data mirrored to read-only PostgreSQL, there is also:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-postgresql\nDoes this answer your question? What kind of manipulation to Wekan you mean?. @CodeBrauer \nDoes changing 'spentTime' with Wekan REST API work for you currently? Or is there feature missing?. @CodeBrauer \nDoes changing 'spentTime' with Wekan REST API work for you currently? Or is there feature missing?.

After that, login is at /sign-in . There has been some changes to those urls sometimes. Please give example of invitation email, etc more details.. @Gobliins \nDoes some of these help? https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1296 https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1241 . Or this https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/06afa1ae35cc00efbe517b30b27c06a18910dffc. Or this https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/06afa1ae35cc00efbe517b30b27c06a18910dffc. @Gobliins \nDid you login to API before using it ?. @huneau @mayjs\nYou did add REST API at #1037 , is there a bug ?. @BruceZCQ \nFor that purpose, there is archive card and list, and restore:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#lists-add-archive-and-restore-archived-delete-list\nDeleting really deletes permanently.. @BruceZCQ \nDo you mean that \"Archive this card\" functionality is too complicated and hard to understand?\nShould these be renamed?\n- \"Archive this card or list\" => \"Delete this card or list\"\n- \"Archived cards/lists\" => \"Recycle Bin\"\nAnd should there be \"Empty Recycle Bin\" on top of those?\nThen, if somebody accidentally empties Recycle Bin or some card/list there, is it OK ?\nOr should there be additional recovery steps?\n@ocdtrekkie \nWhat do you think?. @hever \nFor me, Recycle Bin is more familiar than Archive. I really like it.\nTrello seems to have Archive button. I did not find a way to archive with drag and drop.. @hever \nIn Windows, Recycle bin is not emptied automatically. It's more like that, Windows files and or Wekan cards. Throwing card to trash, restoring it back to board.\nThere is no \"Move to archive\" in Gmail and Windows.. You can rename some board like \"Archive 2017\" and move cards to it.. No, Recycle Bin will stay as Recycle Bin. This is now added to FAQ, with reasons why.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#policy-about-wekan-ui-changes. @hever \nI added IFTTT Rules feature request #1996 . When card is moved to some list, it's only possible to automatically move it to Recycle Bin, not other board yet.\nWell, when I can find option to stop Gmail from deleting emails automatically from Recycle Bin, I will stop calling it a bug. Windows Recycle Bin afaik does not automatically delete files. And I do not know any other software that automatically deletes something.. Yes it's risky. It slows down Wekan a lot when keeping a lot of cards on same board or Recycle Bin. Changing it's name to Archive does not solve anything. Now your Archive is full and slows down Wekan board and you need to click Empty Archive. Emptying Archive is like Emptying .Zip archive or Emptying  Book Library. It does not make any sense. Recycle Bin is not Archive. And you really should not Archive to same board.. @hever \nSorry Wekan still has only Recycle Bin.\nI added Feature Request for unlimited cards and unlimited archive #1999. @generic-user-name \nHow did you install Wekan? I have not seen this error before.. @generic-user-name \nPlease add Wekan grain debug log, that you see with terminal/display looking button.. @generic-user-name  \nSorry, you can not import attachments directly from Trello when using Sandstorm version of Wekan. This is because Wekan is in secure sandbox at Sandstorm, and does not yet have Sandstorm-compatible way to import attachments from outside of Sandstorm.\nYou need to:\n1) Install Standalone version of Wekan, for example Docker/Snap/VirtualBox, for example to your own computer\n2) Import board from Trello\n3) Export board as Wekan board. Exported JSON file includes attachments as base64 encoded files.\n4) Import board as Wekan board to Sandstorm.. @lramage94 \nIn Sandstorm, you can click Wekan grain, and although it does not load, you can download it with arrow down download grain button as .zip file. When that .zip file is extracted, data is inside in MongoDB format. You could look those files what strings they have with linux command \"strings filename\" or with hex editor \"sudo apt install hexedit\", or search with google how to restore data from raw MongoDB database files. I have not tried it yet.. @gergamel  \nThanks for that JSON ! I'll check it.. @gergamel \nIt seems that import on Sandstorm is broken.\nI created new board in Sandstorm => Export to Wekan JSON => Import Wekan JSON => Board not found.\nI created new board in Standalone Wekan => Export to Wekan JSON => Import Wekan JSON to Sandstorm => Board not found.\nYour old Wekan JSON => Import to newest Standalone Wekan => invalid JSON format\nCreate new board in Standalone Wekan => Export to Wekan JSON => Import to Standalone Wekan => Works.\nProblem is that newest Standalone Wekan has swimlanes etc features, so Wekan Export JSON format is different. I have been trying to make Sandstorm version of newest Wekan, but still have problems with even compiling Sandstorm and newest Wekan for Sandstorm gives some C++ errors after all the Meteor 1.6.0.1 upgrades, it does not start correctly.\nFor just using Standalone Wekan with Docker or Snap, you can upgrade to newest Standalone Wekan, and MongoDB export/import to newest Standalone Wekan should work OK. That way you could get newest Export JSON format. But I still need to get newest Wekan somehow working on Sandstorm.. @gergamel \nI will fix Wekan at Sandstorm with Sandstorm developers anyway.\nDocker Hub is usually broken, I use Quay more.\nUse Docker or Snap, see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nSnap has benefit that it's very easy to install to Ubuntu, and updates automatically.\nBut snap loses settings when new update comes, I'm waiting for fix:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/29\nWorkaround is to have some cron script check has the version changed or does the website work, and add those settings back.\n. I have an idea about this I did get when I was at shower :D \nUsually when boards are exported from Sandstorm Wekan, board id is always \"sandstorm\". Also Wekan board URL is also sandstorm, when running at Sandstorm.\nIt could be possible, that if imported board id is not \"sandstorm\", then board will then not be found.\nThis could be tested by looking at trelloCreator.js and wekanCreator.js here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/models\nand comparing to some previous version of Wekan where importing Wekan board still did work.\nThere could be also other changes or differences what has changed, compared to newest Wekan.\nIf someone has time to look at this, it would be nice :)\nI need to get some sleep now.. Ok, probably something has changed in source code so it does not work anymore, I'll check.. @DrGraypFroot \nThis is not fixed yet, that's why this issue is still open.. Help in fixing this would be very welcome. It only requires reading code and figuring it out. Wekan code is very readable.. Here is related story.\nMy own problem is my limited time.. This Checklist data lost issue is separate from this Board not Found issue, but I'm posting it here, because I did also looking at this Board not Found issue.\nI also don't know are these bugs in Wekan, MongoDB, Sandstorm, hard disk corruption, or somewhere else.\nChecklist data lost when upgrading Wekan\nWhen one user of Sandstorm Wekan upgraded to newest Wekan v1.03 or v1.02, on all Wekan grains checklists changed to be like this. Checklist content disappeared, and checklist title was duplicated to checklist items like this:\n\nThe problem is, that I can't duplicate this in any way.\nTo my knowledge, all grains in Sandstorm are separate from each other, and have separate MongoDB databases. I don't know how it's possible that checklists get messed up on all Wekan grains in Sandstorm installed to sandcats.io domain server.\nI have tested on local Sandstorm install these Wekan versions. I create checklist, and upgrade to v1.03, upgrading works fine.\n- 1.00\n- 0.63\n- 0.50\n- 0.41\nIt's different from versions below that.\n- v0.40 has login bug: it opens \"Board not found\" page when loading, same like in Sandstorm Wekan Import Board bug #1430, and has link to sign-in page like standalone Wekan. When I click it, and click Register, it does not allow creating password auth login, because it's currently at Sandstorm.\n- v0.39: Can not connect to Wekan grain network error, log below.\n- v0.34: Can not connect to Wekan grain network error, log below.\nAbout Board not found error\nOn all tested Sandstorm Wekan versions back to Sandstorm Wekan v0.34, I get \"Board not found\" error. This makes me think, that in what version of Wekan has Import Board worked at all? Because I remember being able to import board to Wekan.\nSandstorm Wekan v0.39 error\n```\n...grations.add [as migrationCallback] (server/migrations.js:135:21)\n    at packages/idmontie_migrations.js:238:17\n    at Function.time (/programs/server/profile.js:309:28)\n    at /programs/server/boot.js:423:13\n    at /programs/server/boot.js:464:5\n    at Function.run (/programs/server/profile.js:510:12)\n    at /programs/server/boot.js:462:11\n HTTP-BRIDGE: App server exited with status code: 1\n SANDSTORM SUPERVISOR: Starting up grain.

I did create card with checklists, tried migrating from many versions of Wekan to newest version, and I did not have any issues. It could be some migration code bug or MongoDB bug. It seems strange, because only one migration is running at a time, I would presume, as I have seen on console.. @ocdtrekkie \n1) I have newest Sandstorm locally in my laptop.\n2) I install Wekan old version .spk to Sandstorm.\n3) I create grain and board with checklists, export it.\n4) I create new grain, import previously exported (step 3) JSON file, there is board not found error.\n5) I upload newest Wekan v1.03 spk and upgrade both grains.\n6) Checklists still look the same, I did not get any errors, and was unable to duplicate this upgrade bug.. In step 6\n- 1st grain where I created checklists, still has same checklists, no errors\n- 2st grain, that has board not found error, still has board not found error. @bputt \nThere is proxybourcer to have Google auth in front of Wekan password login, but that is still kind of 2 logins still, it's not integrated.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Let's-Encrypt-and-Google-Auth. Moved to #1160. @fcohernandez \nConfiguring Nginx for Ubuntu snap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config. I think it is not useful to compile Wekan on production Ubuntu servers, as node/meteor etc versions change frequently. It just takes too much time. I recommend Docker and Snap for production use.. @fcohernandez \nGet wekan source, and transfer it to your server, with your modifications:\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan\nThen build and start Wekan on server with Docker:\ndocker-compose up -d --build\nAs you see from latest changes from git repo, I have today changed versions of many dependencies etc parts of Wekan.\nYou can see more info about Wekan Docker at Wekan GitHub wiki backup and docker pages.. @fcohernandez \nYou need to change docker-compose.yml settings for your server settings, it's documented at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb docker-compose.yml textfile.. @fcohernandez \nIf you are trying to add to Wekan some feature that would also be useful to others, please add it as pull request to Wekan devel branch, so you don't need to keep merging source changes all the time. Also if it is a feature that somebody else is already working on, it would be useful that you search is there existing GitHub issue for that feature or add new feature request, and add comment that you are working on it, to prevent duplicate effort.. @danger89 \nThanks! Fixed.. @nurmd \nClick label, and on dropdown menu click same label again to remove it. You can also rename labels, change color, etc edit label in that popup with pen icon.\n\n. @fcohernandez\nYou need to login at API as admin first. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API\nYou can also look at Gogs integration how to use API:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs\nTell me does these work. If not, I need to check it.. Use Wekan v0.65 and Docker Compose script, setup ROOT_URL=http://your-server-ip etc correctly. Reading all on docker-compose script is required.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nWekan only supports MongoDB 3.2.x, not 3.6.x.. ROOT_URL=http://192.168.199.231:7780\nAnd use wekan at webbrowser http://192.168.199.231:7780. Does it work now ?. @Weiping1992 \nIt's possible that this release v0.65 is broken, there are major changes.\nIf you have any important data in Wekan, backup MongoDB from inside of Docker:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nYou can use release v0.63 while waiting for fixed version, change to docker-compose.yml file this:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L61\nChange there:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan\n=>\nimage: wekanteam/wekan:v0.63\nList of Docker Hub tags are at:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/wekanteam/wekan/tags/. Actually, it seems that this was already fixed previously today in this image, so you need to add it to Dockerfile:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan\nTo use it, you need to backup your data just in case (if you had any), and then do:\ndocker stop wekan-app\ndocker rm wekan-app\ndocker rmi quay.io/wekan/wekan:latest    (or wekanteam/wekan:v0.63)\ndocker-compose up -d\nI will also do Wekan v0.66 release soon, in that case it will be this image:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:v0.66. @Weiping1992 \nWekan works better in Firefox currently, see this Chrome bug:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1404\nWebbrowsers rapidly add and remove features, that causes some breakages so some fixes needs to be made sometime.. @evasnowind \nNewest Wekan has Docker version available:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1438#issuecomment-361075193\nOther versions are not ready yet, they will take some time.. @andresmanelli \nCan you look at this? I think my https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/65c081acc0859e9cb2f09f9aa050258952403795 is not enough to fix this.. @tiagosell @centigrade-kdk \nWekan v0.71 includes fix for only importing Wekan board, not importing Trello board:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v071-2018-02-03-wekan-release\n@andresmanelli \nCan you look at fixing importing Trello board ?. @tiagosell \nWait for Wekan version v0.72 to be released, it's currently building Docker image, no need for you to build it.. @mayt2012 \nWekan translations are done at Transifex https://transifex.com/wekan/wekan \nPull requests are only used for new features in en.i18n.json file.. @fbatschi \nI do recommend backups anyway before upgrade and downgrade, just in case.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nExample of downgrade:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1438#issuecomment-361075193\n@andresmanelli \nCan you look at above comments for future swimlanes improvements?. @DissCent \nDo you mean bugs that recent Chrome version did bring when they broke stuff?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/656\nFor me Wekan works fine in Firefox. Chrome is just slow, memory-hungry and buggy, I only use it when something does not work in Firefox.. @DissCent \nI presume you have old version of Wekan. I can move cards and switch lists/swimlane view just fine in newest version. Please reinstall using some of these images:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan\nor\nimage: wekanteam/wekan\nHere is info of how to upgrade:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1438#issuecomment-361075193\n. @DissCent \nWhat version of Firefox you have? I have Firefox v58 for Ubuntu 17.10 64bit.\nWhat operating system you use? Linux/Windows/Mac/something else ?. @DissCent \nCan you try this image?\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan\nI don't really know where you are getting that bug. I do see that there is build failures at Docker Hub. Quay usually works better.. @DissCent \nIn Admin Panel/Version does it show that Wekan version is v0.68 ? If not, you have not removed old containers and images, and you are running old version.. It seems that Docker Hub has old version.. @DissCent \nI think your MongoDB install is broken.\nYou need to backup your MongoDB database with mongodump, reinstall MongoDB like for example remove MongoDB container and image, and restore:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nYou can use MongoDB version that's in Docker Compose file:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. Fixed in Wekan v0.69, I think. Yes, only part 1 of Swimlanes is in Wekan, import/export of Swimlanes is not implemented yet.\nI think currently you need to add some cards in list view to see something in swimlane view.. Please use quay Docker image that has Wekan v0.68 with image: quay.io/wekan/wekan , more details: #1444\nAfter installing Wekan v0.68, do you still have problems?. Sorry, please use Docker tag image: quay.io/wekan/wekan:v0.63 while we fix swimlanes, see #1444\nMoved to #1444. Please use version v0.63 while we fix things, see #1444\nMoved to #1444. Intenal server error is, because email settings are not configured yet.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail\nUsername already exists, because you already registered that user, and it's not possible to resend registration email yet, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1320. Wekan uses Node 8.9.3, NPM 5.1.1 and Meteor 1.6.0.1 because Meteor 1.6.1 is currently broken https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9609\nFor config:\nROOT_URL=http://server-ip-address:3000\nWekan v0.68 is broken. Use previous version v0.63 or wait for new v0.69 to be released in near future, there is fixes for swimlanes.. @tobiasrenger-gh \nUse different wekan-app docker containers for different URLs, using same MongoDB docker container, as mentioned at docker-compose.yml:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. @tobiasrenger-gh \nThose full URLs are how Meteor js framework works. I did give you solution how to have many URLs to use same database. I don't know how to make it relative. Pull requests welcome.. Yes wiki is outdated. If you have time, please fix wiki directly. There also other duplicated and not so well-organized pages.\nSource build script rebuild-wekan-meteor-1.6.sh is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/tree/master/virtualbox\nDocker version can be built from source with docker-compose.yml script at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb , setting ROOT_URL=http://your-ip:your-port and PORT=your-port , and starting building in wekan with docker-compose up --build in foreground mode to see debug output and stopping with Ctrl-c, or starting as service to background with docker-compose up -d --build. Set ROOT_URL to your https://example.com/wekan real address.\nMore info at docker-compose.yml file at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb. Moved to #1256. Using proxy:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1480. @gramakri \nYes, and when you add card, that horizontal scrollbar moves down. There is less movement needed from card to scrollbar. What is the problem or bug here? Wekan is going to have other new features too.. @andresmanelli \nCan you fix this?. @Chartman123  \nWhat is \"Impacted version 0.65+\" ? Did you try 0.69 ? Wekan has changes in each release, they don't work the same.. @andresmanelli \nCan you look at this? One empty column could be enough, I think.. Fix merged, will be included in next release.. @DejfCold \nYou can already use markdown to add links to cards etc, like at https://wekan.github.io . Or do you mean something else?. @ViViDboarder \nAnyone that feels this is urgent, can send pull request to devel branch.. @stahlstift \nOh, I just noticed this. Ok, I'll release today.. @shalev123d \nDid you add corrent ROOT_URL=http://your-ip-address:port to docker-compose.yml at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb ? It should not be localhost, I think. Can you post your docker-compose.yml file with changed passwords and domains like password=password and domain=example.com etc, so I can look are the settings correct?\nAnyway, you could go back to Docker version 63 while we figure out what is causing the error.\nPlease keep frequent backups, and also before upgrades and downgrades, so you have backup outside of Docker:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\n@andresmanelli \nDo you have idea why it gives error  Error: Board id must be a string ?. @shalev123d \nThis Docker Hub image is broken:\nimage: wekanteam/wekan:latest\nYou should use this for latest version:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:v0.71\nAnd when newer release is published, use newer release tag.. Moved to #1318. @naushil \nInfo how how you can add bounty to this as Backer is at https://wekan.team/. @naushil\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/54741329-feature-request-viewing-label-titles-on-cards. Moved to #142. @erikturk\nAdding feature to Wekan is huge and excellent. There is nothing embarrassing, I also fix typos etc all the time.\nHere's how to remove commits:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/36168839/how-to-remove-commits-from-pull-request\nRemove all changes to readme and changelog.\nNew strings are added in pull request to English base translation file wekan/i18n/en.i18n.json \nOther translations are done at https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/ , so remove other translations from pull request.\nThanks!. @erikturk \nTravis is broken for everything, I have not fixed it yet. You don't need to change anything for Travis.. @erikturk \nIt seems that you are implementing Checklist Templates #904 \nUsing this kind of JSON in wekan/i18n/en.i18n.json file and JSON validator like https://jsonlint to check for JSON errors: \n\"copyManyCardPopup-title\": \"Copy Checklist Template to Many Cards\",\n        \"copyManyCardPopup-title-instructions\": \"Destination Card Titles and Descriptions in this JSON format: [ {\\\"title\\\": \\\"First Card title\\\", \\\"description\\\":\\\"First Card Description\\\"}, {\\\"title\\\":\\\"Second Card Description\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Second Card Description\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Last Card title\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Last Card description\\\"} ]\",\nDo the following:\n1) Rename everywhere in your added code variable names, translation variable names, and user visible texts: Copy Multiple Cards => Copy Checklist Template to Many Cards\n2) In below screenshot \"Copy Checklist Template to Many Cards\" popup change:\n- Copy Multiple Cards => Copy Checklist Template to Many Cards\n- Title: => Destination cards and titles in this JSON format:\n- Input box: Your example JSON text, like in screenshot below as pre-filled, and translatable like in wekan/i18n/en.i18n.json above\n\n. @erikturk \nThanks, I will test.. @erikturk \nThere is still variables with names like copyManyCard in translations etc. Those should be renamed to like \"copyChecklistTemplateToManyCards\" or similar. There should not be anything that has any text like copyManyCard, it's not clear enough.. @erikturk \nThanks a lot, now it's perfect ! I will merge it soon and release new version of Wekan with that feature. Developers like you are the worth gold and time well spent for me.. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/29. @andresmanelli \nCan you look at this?. @therampagerado \nDo you mean counting cards in list? Wekan already has that feature, see screenshot below.\nOr do you mean other feature? Please explain, with screenshot mockup if possible.\n\n. @therampagerado \nHi,\nthis is not offtopic, Wekan is general purpose kanban tool that is in use from single users to large companies where there is thousands of users of Wekan, and also in high security places like healthcare etc. Wekan does not by itself send any data to Internet. Wekan is in use in intranets and also works without direct internet access, if you don't need to download updates, or move updates with some media like usb stick or cdrom to intranet.\nWekan does not send email if email settings are not configured correctly.\nIn board settings you can set from other user icons the permissions to comment only, they are not able to delete then.\nPreviewing PDF files is not implemented, please ask about it at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1318 could somebody implent it, or pay some developer to implement it, or add bounty to that issue - instructions at https://wekan.team\nExample of implemented workflow with rest api is at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs , other way to implement workflows is with Huginn or Flogo https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1160\nYou ca update all snaps to newest version with command: sudo snap refresh\nAfter updating you need to setup root-url again https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/29\nREST API docs are at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API\n. @therampagerado \nFirst Wekan user is admin. Every user registers account, logins to wekan, and usually uploads their own face photo as avatar in top right menu profile settings. Admin creates new board and invites board users with existing username to board. Admin clicks some invited member face photo avatar and from that dropdown menu selects permissions as comment only.\nAbout numbering of cards feature, please add screenshot mockups and more detailed description how this feature would work step by step. Are there any developers in your company that can write code to use Wekan REST API ? Or do you have budget for this feature? More details at https://wekan.team. You can check on what port snap mongo is running with:\nsudo netstat -plant | grep mongo\nThen connect to that port, for example:\nmongo --port 27019\nThen look what database name wekan database has:\nshow dbs\nIf you want to delete database sometime, not needed usually:\nuse wekan\ndb.dropDatabase();\nAnyway when you know database name, you can exit mongodb:\nexit\nThen restore database to inside snap mongo:\nmongorestore --drop --port 27019 --db wekan\n. @jshupptechnologies \nWhat 0.6 ? I don't see that version at changelog:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md\nI don't even have that version anywhere.. @jshupptechnologies\nPlease include some example exported Wekan board that does not import to newest Wekan, so we can fix import. You can edit JSON textfile to remove any text that has some private info.. @jshupptechnologies \nYou can attach that JSON file in .zip archive to this issue.. Please upgrade to newest Wekan release.\nWebhooks are usually added to Rocket.Chat, slack etc. You can look at Webhook features and format in Wekan GitHub wiki Features page and Webhooks links in wiki menu.\nUsually problem with webhooks is that you have some firewall blocking receiving webhooks, or some typo in webhook URL.\nYou can also search other Wekan GitHub open and closed issues and pull requests with word \"webhook\" for more information. . Moved to #1402. @sojournerc \nSee about Wekan development at general at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/119#issuecomment-362918407\nMeteor 1.6.0.1 docs:\nhttps://docs.meteor.com/v1.6/\nWekan already has WIP Limits and Spent time, but not totals from them.\nYou can look at https://github.com/wekan/wekan repo with git history viewer like gitk how other features have been implemented, or search closed pull requests at GitHub.\nWekan does not have plugins, because for example at Sandstorm platform Wekan code is read-only and there is no possibility to add plugin code afterwards.\nI presume you know more about those Metrics as you have used them, so you can implement those as you think it would best fit to Wekan general look and feel.\nFeel free to add questions to this issue as needed.. Custom Fields is not merged yet to Wekan:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/807\nProbably it would be helpful in some parts of your Metrics.. Do you use these commands with backup and restore?\nBackup\nmongobackup\nRestore\nmongorestore --drop\n. Try using newest Wekan version.. @sonntagd \nDoes restoring to snap work?\n. @ntaboada \nInstall Docker for Mac, and use Docker Compose script, adding root-url etc settings there:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nIf you want to build source, clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan repo, copy your docker-compose.yml file there with correct root-url etc settings, and do:\ndocker-compose up -d --build. Wekan is not Trello, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/92#issuecomment-364590215\nMoved to #1466. @naushil \nNo problem :) Wekan does import from Trello etc :). @naushil \nSetup bounty for #1466 as it is same issue, I will add instructions to there.. @NegativeDearc \nIf you get Docker installed, you can setup Docker to use proxy:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/\nThen you can start Wekan with Docker like this, change 192.168.1.200 to your IP address and 8080 to your port:\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo:3.2.18\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=http://192.168.1.200:8080\" -p 8080:80 quay.io/wekan/wekan:v0.73\n```\nAnother option is to download VirtualBox image and setup it to use Bridged Networking:\nhttps://wekan.xet7.org\nThen setup Ubuntu to use proxy:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/664777/systemwide-proxy-settings-in-ubuntu\nThen rebuild newest Wekan from source with rebuild-wekan-meteor-1.6.sh script:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/tree/master/virtualbox\nDoes this help?. Building Wekan on Mac:\nInstall Docker for Mac, and use Docker Compose script, adding root-url etc settings there, this downloads prebuilt docker containers:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nYou can save Docker images of wekan and mongodb containers to file with save command, and load it with load command on another computer:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/\nThen you start this docker-compose.yml file with your restores images name, like:\nimage: dsf83032yerh\nfor both wekan-app and mongodb containers:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nIf you really want to build source (takes more time), clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan repo, copy your docker-compose.yml file there with correct root-url etc settings, and do:\ndocker-compose up -d --build\n. @andresmanelli \nCan you look at this?. @jkryanchou \nNo. This issue is still open. I usually close those issues that are fixed.. @jkryanchou \nYou can support developing Wekan with Commercial Support and Bounties https://wekan.team. I think dragging checklists worked when @GhassenRjab added it at #876 but after @andresmanelli added swimlanes #955 there is some bug in migrations at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/migrations.js so dragging does not work anymore.\n@andresmanelli @GhassenRjab \nCan you look at this?. @mlorgeoux  \nAre you running Wekan v0.34 ? Why not latest Wekan version?. @onatto \nHorizontal scrolling in swimlanes mode still works for me.. Moved to #1497. @swood \nYes. Meteor.js framework parses MongoDB changes realtime and updates everything realtime.\nFor that amount of data, you need to have Wekan server installed similarly like production cluster at AWS with high-speed connectivity for Wekan to be useable. I would also recommend adding redis oplog as described in the link above.\nWhen importing that large board, it's very likely that Wekan tries to get a lot of attachments from Trello, and if server is not powerful enough, you could have timeouts, or have some data missing.. @swood \nI have not tried redis-oplog yet, because without that performance has been enough for thousands of users.\nWekan already has mixmax:smart-disconnect added. You see it that Wekan only updates itself on webbrowser when browser tab is active. When you use other browser tab, Wekan will timeout and be idle, and when you switch back to Wekan tab, Wekan will connect to backend again and update webpage.\nFor your use case, having Wekan installed on one powerful enough server installed at AWS or elsewhere (other than your laptop) should be enough to get that big Trello JSON imported. You can add comment to this issue about did it work for you.. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/29. I have emailed admins of that website. They will fix it asap. Please try again later.. @Gobliins \nAll currently know swimlanes issues have been listed on Roadmap https://github.com/wekan/wekan/projects/2 . Please support work of @andresmanelli with bounties etc.. Please wait for change logo feature to be finished, I have it in progress, see Roadmap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/projects/2\nThere will sometime also be bugfix for keeping snap settings when upgrades happen, then cron workaround is not needed anymore:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/29. You can support change logo work with adding bounty to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1196 , instructions at https://wekan.team. @ocdtrekkie \nMost Swimlane issues are already added to Roadmap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/projects/2\nThose will get fixed when contributing companies get up-to-speed in helping with HTML/CSS issues etc, it's in progress, but can take some time.\nWekan web UI will also sometime be organized better, so settings are not in so many submenus, but combined to some organized settings pages.. @ocdtrekkie \nWhen I tried creating new board in newest Wekan for Sandstorm, I was unable to add cards.. @therampagerado \nThe shadow fix is already in newest released Ubuntu Snap, and snap usually updates automatically, so if you hare using snap, you already have the fix.. This did work earlier when I merged and tested this feature, but maybe swimlanes or some other addition broke it.. @therampagerado \nThanks a lot for reporting this, I did not know this was broken. It is very important to know if something is broken.\nWe have new developers and companies getting up to speed in adding fixes and new features to Wekan, it just takes some time.. This is already fixed in newest Wekan v1.03.. @therampagerado \nThere are 2 alternatives for using time without AM/PM:\na) Change language to \"English (UK)\"\nb) Translate Wekan to Bulgarian language here, and change to use it:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan\nThere is no feature for setting default time for time field yet.. @therampagerado \nThis is issue, and those are usually about bugs or feature requests. I do often change issue titles to describe what new is actually asked, it's very normal thing to do.\nThis is not PR = pull request, you have no new code added in this. I do also often change pull request titles, and ask for changes in text like in this pull request that has code, because usually text can be changed to better describe what feature is implemented, so it is understood better. It's very normal thing to do.\nOnly new thing you are asking is setting default time.\nThere is no bug in setting time. If you are using US English, there is no such thing like 1500, there is only 03:00 PM, it's 12 hour clock, not 24 hour.\n\nWhen English UK is selected:\n\nThen you can add start time like 15:00\n\nAnd due date like 18:00\n\n. @therampagerado \nYou can add new feature request as new GitHub issue, and anyone can add pull request with code that adds those features, with possibility of admin to limit results to 10 or any other number of results, and enable searching of archived cards.\nBut those are not part of original specs at #552 , because returning much more results would really slow down everything when there is thousands of users. This pull request implements those original specs, and for that @GhassenRjab gets all of the bounty for this search feature. @GhassenRjab already spent more time than expected with implementing this feature, it was not easy.. @leosco \nDocker Hub is broken, as is mentioned at releases page. Please use Quay.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases. @GhassenRjab \nYes you can fix warnings too. Thanks!. @GhassenRjab \nActually, I'm in progress of merging this, so you can fix warning in another pull request.. Moved to #1320. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/36. @rosmoo \nUpdate to latest Wekan snap:\nsudo snap refresh\nDo you then have this revision 136 (or newer) of Wekan? Wekan works for me.\n$ sudo snap list\n[sudo] password for user: \nName   Version           Rev   Developer  Notes\ncore   16-2.31.1         4110  canonical  core\nwekan  0.77-22-gbbca361  136   xet7       -\n. @rosmoo \nDo you still have problems with Wekan revision 136 ?. @rosmoo \nToday has been at least 2 new revisions pushed to snap, fixing bugs etc.. @Gobliins \nCan you try to make pull request to devel branch?\n. @Gobliins \nOn what lines in source code? Can you attach modified file to this issue in .zip archive ?. @simopaasisalo \nPlease try from GitHub releases page quay docker image latest tag, is this still an issue. Some scrolling bugs were fixed yesterday.. @simopaasisalo \nI did:\n- make a long list\n- open card, it opened at top\n- scrolled to up using scrollbar that is between card display and sidebar\n- changed card details\nSure it's not yet possible to scroll in middle of the page yet, only using right scrollbar, so editing card is possible, but it could be improved.. I'm using latest Ubuntu Snap version and Firefox 58.0.1 on Debian Sid 64bit. I have not tried other versions.. @RobinELM \nThis is the recommended way to install Wekan, it's very fast and easy:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\nCurrent supported versions of Node, Mongo etc are listed at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile\nProduction setup for thousands of users with Docker at AWS:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/AWS\nDetails about adding bounty to this issue: https://wekan.team\nIn short, copying this issue URL to bountysource.com search field fill find bounty URL.\nSupporting this issue with bounties is very welcome, because I have already\nspent very many hours trying to upgrade Meteor to 1.6.1, without\nanyone supporting this financially.. @carlos22 \nI don't know, that needs to be tested, does it work with all dependencies of Wekan.. @carlos22 \nOnly Meteor 1.6.1 has support for newer version of MongoDB. Previous versions did not support 3.4 at all.\nThat MongoDB version issue is mainly about having attachments in MongoDB. There is #142 about storing attachments elsewhere, after that there should not be problems with newer MongoDB versions.\nSupport for other databases comes sometime in future.. @carlos22 \nI don't yet have enough funds for rewrite so I will continue Meteor version for now, and add other database support when it comes possible.. It would be nice to get rid of fibers sometime. Fibers is hard to compile on arm64 and vagrant, and also has 100% CPU usage bugs.. @ocdtrekkie \nFibers does coroutines / subroutines, I think (someone can correct me if I'm wrong). So meteor can do stuff in background. This is helpful, because Javascript usually is single threaded, so it makes multitasking possible. Fibers is made with C++, and is hard to compile. In meteor.js you don't need to write word \"Fibers\", because Meteor uses it in background non-visible automatic way. Fibers is a hack, and a non-standard way to use node.js.\nBetter alternative is to change use promises and async-await, it is standard way in node. But I don't know can Meteor and all included Wekan packages work completely without Fibers. @kentonv do you know?. TODO: try upgrading to 1.7\nhttps://blog.meteor.com/meteor-1-7-and-the-evergreen-dream-a8c1270b0901. Edge now has Meteor 1.8.1-beta.0 and MongoDB 4.0.3 available for Docker testing https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/CHANGELOG.md . Wekan uses Meteor 1.6.x. You can test Meteor 1.8.x based Docker tags and report are there speed improvements to that issue.. @lunatic4ever @usernotuse \nPlease try latest Ubuntu Snap version.. @usernotuse \nWhat does these commands show as your Wekan version?\n$ sudo snap refresh\n$ sudo snap list\nName   Version           Rev   Developer  Notes\ncore   16-2.31.1         4110  canonical  core\nwekan  0.77-29-g9e62584  137   xet7       -\n@ocdtrekkie @therampagerado \nNewest fixes are not yet at newest Sandstorm version yet. Please wait for next release, as only I can make releases for Sandstorm.. @Madko \nDid you setup ROOT_URL correctly like described at here?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L70-L86\nDid you restore MongoDB with mongorestore --drop ? If not, all data is not restore correctly.. I don't know why you use old Docker install. There are import fixes in newer docker quay latest tag, although I have not tested it.\nSandstorm import/export is broken, there is work to update it, but it's not ready yet.. @ttx \nPlease test does import work on newest Standalone Wekan.\nIf possible, for Standalone Wekan I recommend using Ubuntu Snap version on Debian 9 or Ubuntu 16.04 or later. Snap gets updates automatically. There has been lots of swimlanes fixes, so it's getting quite useable currently.\nSandstorm Wekan also has only couple bugs left, like import/export and creating new board. Other new features like search and swimlanes do work on board upgraded from older version. I recommend waiting for these bugs to be fixed, and not using experimental Sandstorm version yet.. I think that when using those lists at right, cards should open to left side, not right.. If cards open on top, I don't see what else is in the same list, as I'm going through cards in the list. It's not good that way.. @therampagerado \nWhat features on cards? I don't know about time-frames yet.. @therampagerado\nIt is on \"Status not known\".\nI did try to merge it previously, but failed. Help welcome, anyone can try to clean it up and submit working pull request.. @therampagerado \nDoh, I myself added Custom Fields in blog post about plans for 2018 previously. Ok, so I added it to my todo list. I'll try harder :). Docker Hub wekanteam/wekan is broken, as can be seen from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases page, only quay latest tag really has latest Wekan. Generally I recommend Ubuntu Snap version, because it updates automatically to newest version. Anyway, this bug is still at newest Snap, so it affects all platforms.. @alexandrevl\nIs this still a problem with latest Snap revision 145 or quay docker image latest tag?. @andresmanelli \nCan you check is this still needed, and include it if needed?. @centigrade-thomas-becker \nWhere did you get that old docker compose file? It uses old version number of MongoDB.\nCorrect docker-compose file is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml\nIt downloads precompiled Docker container from quay, for normal use there is not need to compile it.\ndocker-compose up -d\nIf you instead want to compile it in Docker:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan\ncd wekan\n```\nThen edit docker-compose.yml file in wekan directory to have your correct ROOT_URL etc, and built it:\ndocker-compose up -d --build. @sirup\nYou have old snap. Newest is revision 145. Do \"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo snap refresh\". @mouhong \nPlease install snap release from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases , it is easiest.\nNode versions etc are listed at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile\n. @mouhong \nNewer versions of node don't work yet, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1522. Recommended way to install Wekan:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. @jshupptechnologies\nYes, I can add it, if someone adds bounty to this issue. More details about bounties at https://wekan.team. Moved to #142. Moved to #142. This is the recommended way to install Wekan, it's very fast and easy:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\nCurrent supported versions of Node, Mongo etc are listed at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile\nIf you want to use MongoDB 3.4, you need to pay for\nmy commercial support https://wekan.team \nso that Wekan can be upgraded to Meteor 1.6.1,\nmore details at #1522. @Hendrik410\nMost likely you have old version. When I click card, it opens. I can scroll card up and down with mouse wheel. I can then scroll list up and down and select other card, while card stays open. When I click another card, it's details are show in opened card.\nI recommend:\n1) Making a backup:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\n2) Removing Wekan, and installing Snap version, that has automatic updates:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\n3) Restoring to Snap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Backup-and-restore. @Hendrik410 \nNo. As you see from releases, docker is broken and destroys your data.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nAlso Snap updates automatically, docker does not.. Pull requests for unicode emoji selector welcome.. @rugk \nFixing this would create usability problem, that I would not see attach file popup is open all the time, if I just want to look around. Attach file popup would just scroll away. It would be problematic on big boards.. Search original spec only did not cover searching from archived cards, list titles and other boards, because of performance issues when there is lots of boards. This is not a bug. Add a new feature request issue and bounties to get it implemented.. Use snap, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1536. @andresmanelli \nWOW this works so well, it's so cool ! I will merge soon, thanks a lot !. @typia \nCurrently files are in CollectionFS format at MongoDB database in CollectionFS format.\nAdd your feature request description and bounty to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/142 , info about bounties at https://wekan.team. @rjevnikar \nPlease remove other commits, only leave one last commit. Here is info how to remove commits:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1470\nAfter that I can test it more.\nThanks!. @rjevnikar \n\n\nRemove all other translations, add new ones only to i18n/en.i18n.json\n\n\nRemove changing case of strings at client/components/settings/informationBody.jade\n\n\n. @rjevnikar \nPlease remove old release tag v0.53. @rjevnikar \nPlease remove old release tag v0.53. Here is how to remove old tag https://gist.github.com/mobilemind/7883996\nRemove all text case changes from i18n/en.i18n.json that you also made at\nclient/components/settings/informationBody.jade .\nIt would be best that you restore original en.18n.json from latest Wekan commit, and add your changes to there, so original casing and order is preserved.. This does not work with rebuild-wekan-meteor-1.6.sh script option 3. I recommend you rename your own fork of wekan, create new fork of wekan, add your changes to those files and i18n/en.i18n.json file, check that it builds and works, and submit new clean pull request. Thanks!. Try snap. Docker is broken, as you see from releases page.. @andresmanelli \nCan you look at this?. In Lists view, lists can not be dragged.\nWhen I click Lists button to switch to Swimlanes view, in Swimlanes view lists can be dragged.. Docker currently is so broken, that I only respond to Snap and Sandstorm issues. See releases page for more info.. 0.63 has a lot of bugs I think, compared to newest experimental version.\nWith newest experimental version old grains have opened correctly for me, if I don't import anything.\nThere will not be fixes to v0.63, so I'm closing this issue.. @teras \nIt's already possible to install experimental version of Wekan from Sandstorm experimental app market, there is link at releases page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nThere is no integration needed, it's already at Sandstorm. Just couple of bugs to fix.. @ocdtrekkie\nPlease approve 0.78, so I don't get these issues about old bugs.. @ma4git \nOpen issue about \"Board not found\" is at #1430 . It is not fixed yet. If you want to import for Trello etc, use Wekan Snap version.. Moved to #794. Use snap.. If you want SSL, you can use use caddy, or other webserver as decribed in Wekan GitHub wiki.\nWhen using caddy, caddy uses ports 80 and 443, and proxies to Wekan 3001.\nIf you don't need https, you can set port='80'\nWekan itself only has http.. Hmm, what kind of server is it? I think Snap does not run on OpenVZ.. Maybe you need to install from source anyway.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/tree/master/virtualbox\nThere use rebuild-wekan-meteor-1.6.sh first with option 1 to install dependencies, and option 3 to compile wekan. Modify start-wekan.sh script settings as needed.. Those scripts can be used directly on server, without VirtualBox.. What kernel does server have?\nuname -a. Snap should work on that kernel.\nHow much RAM does server have?\nfree -m. If you still have previously installed MongoDB running, you can stop it, because snap has it's own:\n```\nsudo systemctl stop mongodb\nsudo systemctl disable mongodb\n```. @RCohenE5Group \nPlease ask from OVH support is there some limitations on virtualization used on that server. Maybe some kernel permissions are disabled or something. Snap does work for me at AWS EC2 and DigitalOcean, I don't know what's wrong with OVH.. Snap is \"Ubuntu snap\" software, https://snapcraft.io , for many different distros.. For me snap works for example on Debian 9, Ubuntu 17.10 and CentOS 7.. Some of the error messages you posted are similar that I got on Qubes OS that is based on XEN virtualization, so I was unable to use Snap on Qubes OS, but anyway installation from source and using mongodb from Debian 9 repos did work.. @RCohenE5Group \nIn your start-wekan.sh setup:\n```\nexport ROOT_URL=https://wekan.youdomain.com\nexport PORT=8000\n. also check that you have mongodb running as service:\nsudo systemctl start mongodb\nsudo systemctl enable mongodb\n. Really? Are snap services running correctly?\nsudo snap services\n.\nsudo snap set wekan root-url=\"https://wekan.yourdomain.com\"\nsudo snap set wekan port='3001'\n```\nAnd then setup Nginx to proxy to port 3001.. Debian 9 uses systemd, you can reload nginx with:\nsudo systemctl reload nginx. Do you have websockets enabled on Nginx?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config. There's something wrong with Nginx settings, it does not proxy .js etc files.. When card is not open, you can add labels to cards.\nWhen card is open, you edit labels directly at card, by clicking labels buttons at card. Not dragging from sidebar from right border.\nIs this what you mean? What is the bug?. It seems that at Sandstorm there's some problems dragging labels from sidebar to cards.\nEditing labels at cards directly seems to work.. Labels should be edited directly on card. It's enough.. @sirup \nI presume you did import your MongoDB database with this command?\nmongorestore --drop --port 27019. I recommend using mongodump for backups.\nIf you still have problems, add new issue.. First user is admin, that has top right menu when clicking username => Admin Panel. There can be set which users are admin.. Yes, that's how permissions work.\nAlso, when you login to Wekan, you only see your own boards. To see shared boards, someone needs to invite to shared board.. There are also some cleanup scripts:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-cleanup\nNot all delete functionality is implemented yet. Pull requests and bounties welcome.. For some functionality there is API:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API\nFiles are currently stored in MongoDB database. I will add Google Drive support later:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/142\n. Here is how to list boards of user:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API#information-about-boards-of-user. Groups/Teams feature will be in Wekan later, it could be that then it's possible to have boards added for teams https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/802\nIt is at Roadmap column \"In Progress: by ss+\". Anyway, I recommend looking at Roadmap, and searching for open issues / feature requests. If there is not your feature, then add new issue about feature request.. @ahillio \nYes, you can use for example curl or some programming language with Wekan REST API.\nAlso see Wekan Gogs integration as an example.\nREST API works on Standalone Wekan (like Snap version) now. \nI'm currently working to enable REST API for Sandstorm Wekan, having it working ASAP in near future.\n. @gotjoshua \n1) Because if fix is not there, when using Alpine Linux at host, and running Wekan Docker container on top of Alpine Linux, there is a crash.\n2) You can clean up etc, if build still keeps working.\n3) I don't know, you could check does it work without it.\n4) Yes, as you see from Roadmap ss+ did have some optimizations for Dockerfile, but not had time to contribute changes yet. So please continue, because you seem to have some of optimizations done already.\nThere is also wekan-dev Dockerfile for development, you can also check that.\nThanks!. @gotjoshua \nwekan/wekan dockerfile is tried to make of small image size, I think. If you can make it smaller, it would nice.\nwekan/wekan-dev is made for development and faster rebuilds, but could be made better.\nThere are still unchecked pull requests at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-dev/pulls\nIf these approaches could be combined, that would be even better.. @andresmanelli @gotjoshua @whodafly \nI added direct commit access to you to https://github.com/wekan/wekan-dev . Please go ahead and test changes and merge issues there. I don't currently have time for Docker.. @biji \nHow is this a problem? Please describe with more detail.\nFiltering cards does filter by label or username.\nNewest Wekan is v0.79.. Yes, I'm looking at why it does not work.. Could be related to #1396. Works now with latest changes. Will be included to next Wekan release.. @kelvinhammond \nI have not looked at it yet. I would guess it could be for example a typo in card link. You could use browser right click \"Inspect element\" does the link look correct, and some Wekan componets like lists and cards\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/client/components\nI currently am looking at Sandstorm API issue that has deadline in near future, so I don't have time to look at other issues yet.. Latest Wekan version is v0.93. Snap upgrades automatically, Docker doesn't.\n@andresmanelli \nDo you have time to look at this?. @danger89 \nYou could compare links, code etc in Firefox with Inspect Element in these different cases at desktop:\n when full desktop mode of Wekan is visible\n when you make Firefox window smaller so it goes to mobile mode. Difference could be also in CSS, for example if CSS does not include same bindings to javascript code in fullscreen and mobile mode.\nYou could install Wekan from source (see github releases page) and then do:\ncd wekan\nmeteor\nThen register user account at /sign-up, login at /sign-in.\nThen create test board and try changing some code in wekan/client/components.\nWhen you make changes to code, you see meteor changing it live.\nAlso look at Mobile Web changes and pull request.\nI'm interested to seeing what Meteor error message is outputted to console when mobile web link is used. It can show related code files and line numbers.. Hmm, that's interesting in the video.\nWhat is in that TypeError is null blue link on line ...js:1:6261 ?. It seems that this is mostly about CSS changes here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/442/files\nThere is also javascript that toggles that mobile CSS to enabled, based on screen width.\nThat pull request was made a long time ago, then cleaned up and merged, but it's unfinished.\nYou could compare original pull request code, and current Wekan code, are there\nsuch changes that have broken link clicking functionality.\nThe current way to show mobile CSS is not so well designed. There is scroll bar at bottom between lists and bottom navigation bar:\n\nWhen that scrollbar is scrolled to right, there is sidebar:\n\nWhen I make Firefox window wider, click card to open it in full view mode, and then back to mobile width, the card is shown opened below list of cards:\n\nTo fix this, it would probably be mostly changing CSS in .styl files to make it look better..

This is already fixed.. No, nobody is paying for this using my Commercial Support https://wekan.team , and no one else has added comment to this issue that he/she is working on this.. I think this issue is just about adding webhook. There are other issues about IFTTT #1160, email, etc. Probably this will be implemented by pull request someone adds, or sometime this year when I happen to need this.. Yes, there has been changes to Checklist database structure to make it easier to reorder checklists, so not all related issues are fixed yet.. Normal users should be able to switch view independently.. Yes, there is a bug, but no fix by anybody yet.. Possible use case also:\nForms in a card\nOr: Markdown form to live form with checklists etc options\n\nThis need some thinking what would be most useful way for any of this to work.\nShould there be:\n- just a way to hide checklist names\n- could there be other types of \"checklists\" like text fields, images, etc items that can be selected instead of checklist, like in questionnaire forms.. @quantazelle \nWhat would be better icon? From:\nhttps://fontawesome.com/icons\nCurrently when I changed it, it looks this way. Is this good enough? I did not find better icon yet. If I take icon away, it looks too funny, when checklist name is more right than checkbox below.\n\n. I figured out how to have that Material Design look on checklist. I will add that change soon.\n\n. @SiGmAX666 \nWekan uses perak:markdown package for markdown. Not GitHub markdown. You could look there what it supports.\nYou could alternatively:\n- use HTML to format checklist to look like that\n- use in progress Custom Fields current, upcoming, or new feature request at #807. Anyone can add and fix translations at Transifex:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan. Huh? I'll check at code.... Maybe something is missing from database schema migrations?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/migrations.js\nHere is current boards schema:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/models/boards.js\nYou could also try board export to Wekan JSON at old Wekan, and import Wekan JSON at new Wekan, when using Standalone Wekan like Docker or Snap.. Restoring needs to be done with this for Docker version:\nmongorestore --drop --port 27017\nAnd for snap version where mongo is in different port:\nmongorestore --drop --port 27019. But, Wekan container needs to be stopped first, otherwise MongoDB contents gets corrupted.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Backup-and-restore. @drieu \nWhen you create board with labels, you can export that board like a template board, and import back to Wekan, then you have 2 boards with same labels..

Probably Title needs to be set as optional somehow.. @pierreozoux \nAfter this Docker image is built in a moment, please test that it fixes this issue:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan. @salleman33 \nThanks a lot ! This is a very nice starting point for me.\nI would really like if I could get more pull requests for auth like this, because it is enough that it works somehow. Standalone Wekan still has only password auth integrated, and I have not got any status info about LDAP etc.. @hypery2k \nThis PR needs settings added as environment variables as described in LDAP issue. @johnleeming \nWhat you tried to add? I can not add any MS fonts to Wekan. Wekan uses free Roboto font..  @johnleeming \nIt's not possible for me to delete pull requests, see:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/18318097/delete-a-closed-pull-request-from-github\nAFAIK this pull request does not contain any sensitive data.. @Crandy \nDocker Hub is usually broken.

Should I go back to original font?. Ok, I'll change original font back.. @lichtamberg \nProblem is that older people don't see as well as young people. So I prefer not to change to lighter font.. @therampagerado \nDo all users have Bulgarian selected as Wekan language and webbrowser language? So there is no additional languages added in browser settings of those users that have that problem?. This depends on browser language settings and Wekan settings. To behave same, all needs to be same.. https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/. Hmm, I think that feature is not yet in Wekan.. Actually, in progress feature Top Level projects will solve this.\nMoved to #641. Please wait for next release of Wekan that has checklists fixes.\nWekan only supports MongoDB 3.2.x. There is problems with attachments with 3.4.x.. @dopaminereceptionist \nPlease see #1602 if you mean that, or add a new issue.. @andresmanelli \nLink icons\nLinked card and board should have icons of link/share (already exists) and card/board. Card background color should not be dependent on link feature.\nColor\nCurrently it's possible to set color for board and label.\nThere should be ability to set any color as hex code for\n- card background any color: All cards like for being part of dark theme, or individual cards\n- list background any color\n- swimlane background any color\nAdd Card | Link Card | Link Board\nThere is button \"Add Card\"  => \"Add | Import / Find\".\nAll buttons should be visible, like: Add Card | Link Card | Link Board\nWhen clicking \"Link Card\", there should be only popup that has only possibility to link single card from some board to this board. This is the bottom part of current popup.\nWhen clicking \"Link Board\", there should be only popup to select board. This is the top part of current popup.\nSearch\nSearching options should be moved from Add Card to right sidebar, that opens when clicking Search button at top of board. From there could be dropdown of boards, where to search from.\nWhen at Search field Enter is pressed at keyboard, it shoud start searching, like in current Search in right sidebar. At Add Card / Search it did not work, I did need to select dropdowns, but anyway from that Add Card place search can be removed.\n. @andresmanelli \nLinked card or board location\nThere should be visible somewhere, that where original card is, for example names of project => board => list. Something logical like that.. @andresmanelli \nI need to think about design in general. That \"Add Card | Link Card | Link Board\" gets too long and crowded. Following is just thinking in progress.\nThere also needs to be a way to rename \"Add Card\" to \"Add Vehicle\" or some other text, probably at list and/or swimlane level.\nAt top and bottom of list  + - \u2630\nAdd\n\n=> Card  (if + button at top, adds to top, if + button at bottom, adds to bottom)\n    => Link to Card  (if + button at top, adds to top, if + button at bottom, adds to bottom)\n    => Link to Board  (if + button at top, adds to top, if + button at bottom, adds to bottom)\n    => List => Left / Right\n    => Swimlane => Up / Down\n    => Follow\n\nRemove\n\n=> Move List to Recycle Bin\n    => Move Swimlane to Recycle Bin\n    => Unfollow\n    => More => Delete List\n\nSettings and move\n\u2630 => \n. @andresmanelli \nPlease change everywhere in code, model names, translations, database, etc:\n Import => Link\n importedCard => linkedCard\n importedBoard => linkedBoard\n importedId => linkedId. @andresmanelli \nIn Link popup:\n Rename topic Link Card => Link\n Rename right button Link => Link Board\n Rename bottom button Link => Link Card\n Also change these everywhere in code, variable names, translations, etc, so it's clear which functionality is used in each case. @andresmanelli \nIn Wekan lists:\n* Rename + Add Card => + Add Card or Link\nIn Search popup:\n* Change title Search Card to Search Card. Click card to add link.. @andresmanelli \nOn linked card, on unopened card directly visible:\n With smaller italic text, on top of card right side of icon: Boardname > Listname\n Below that, card text with original formatting.\nOn linked card itself, when it's opened to the right:\n Add card icon to top of the card\n With smaller italic text, on top of card right side of icon: Boardname > Listname\n* Below that, card text with original formatting.\nOn linked board, on unopened card directly visible:\n Board name to italic text\n Below: Board description with normal formatting, as is seen on Wekan All boards view.\nOn linked board itself, when it's opened to the right:\n Add board icon to top of the card\n On right side board icon, add board name with italic text\n* Below: Board description text with normal formatting, as is seen on Wekan All boards view.\nHow those linked boards work? Have you implemented it yet?. When board is opened, icon should change to opened folder icon.\nWhen card is opened, it should change to opened card or be rotated little to clockwise.\nBoard and card icons with path at right side of icon should be visible both on card and opened card details at top. Below those is actual card title.\nOn linked boards, when board card is opened, lists should be visible as checklist names. Checkbox should be added to left side of list name, and also added to lists model, so each list is actually also checklist. Those list checkboxes should be also visible at board's lists, left side of list names, and be able to be checkmarked there.\nCheckboxes should be added to board model, left side of board names, and linked-board-cards, where checkbox on board-card can be checkmarked both on card itself and card details.\nCheckboxes should be added to card model, left side of card names, and linked-cards, where checkbox on cards and linked-cards can be checkmarked both on card itself and card details. Current static checkmarked icon on cards then will be working as it can be checked and unchecked.\nThis way it will be: Boardname checkbox / Listname checkbox / Cardname checkbox / Checklistname checkbox / ChecklistItem checkbox.\nOn linked-board-card, there should be count of checkmarked lists, like there is already on linked-card/card count of checkmarked checklists.\nOn linked-board-card details, between list checkbox and list name, should be count of checked checklists.\nBetween checklist name checkboxes and checklist checkboxes should be count of checklist items.\n. On linked-board-card attachments, there should be links to all cards that have attachments on linked-board, like this:\n[attachment-icon] [total number of attachments] Boardname\n- [attachment-icon] [number of attachments in card] Listname1 > Cardname1 [external-link-alt-icon]\n- [attachment-icon] [number of attachments in card] Listname2 > Cardname2 [external-link-alt-icon]\nhttps://fontawesome.com/icons/external-link-alt?style=solid\nNot any attachment directly there. Link to card should open card on top to new popup. Each bullet point line above from attachment-icon to external-link-alt-icon is clickable area, when clicked, it opens card in new popup.\nOn linked-board-card itself, there should be [attachment-icon] [total number of attachments in linked board], same way as there is total of attachments in linked-card.. On linked-board-card, there should be buttons Collapse All and Uncollapse All. That setting should be board-wide, like Hide system messages slider, so if someone is looking at collapsed mode, others are collapsed too on next opened card. If setting is not saved yet, default should be Collapse All.\nAt left side of Listname checkbox should be black triangle https://fontawesome.com/icons/caret-right?style=solid pointing to right. When that triangle is clicked, it should animate clockwise 45 degrees, and reveal all Card names below it. When Card name triangle is clicked, it should expand all Checklist names below it. When checklist name triangle is clicked, it should expand all ChecklistItems below it.. On linked-board-card / lists / card, there should be:\n```\n\n[_] Cardname [external-link-alt-icon]\n```\nhttps://fontawesome.com/icons/external-link-alt?style=solid\n\nWhen external-link-alt-icon is clicked, it opens linked card in new popup.. On linked-board-card, there should be these add buttons:\n+ Add List\n  + Add Card\n    + Add Checklist\n      + Add Checklist Item\nThose Add texts should be same as previously used ones in card.\nWhen those are collapsed, only Add List should be visible below of all of those > [_] Checklistnames. When some single checklistname is opened from triangle, it shows other Add possibilities as needed.. linked-board-card backround color should be the same as it is in All boards view, originally set as board color.. When clicking Search, it looks like that it loads and goes through all cards in the board. This can take a long time, if there is board where is a lot of cards.\nChange Search so that it only loads board names to dropdown, and only after in Search field the word to search is written and Enter key pressed from keyboard, it starts searching. Because otherwise everyone just opening Search take resources, even if they were just looking at what is in the menus, and not starting to search something.. I think I listed too many requirements.\nI'll look does this pull request work in Wekan as it currently is.. @andresmanelli \nThanks! You can add changes when you have time.. @andresmanelli \nYes I will test. Thanks!. @andresmanelli \nDo you have any idea why these Link and Search do not open popup at Sandstorm? Did you disable some code on Sandstorm, using isSandstorm checks?\n<a class=\"js-link is-active\" href=\"#\">Link</a>\n<a class=\"js-search is-active\" href=\"#\">Search</a>. Doh, using eslint --fix did break those Link and Search. Without eslint fixed code works. I'll try to fix.. It seems that this does not work on Welcome Board, and newly created Sandstorm board. I'll check is there missing migrations.. I'm unable to duplicate this.. Websocket config is required in nginx:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config. You need to proxy to localhost in nginx config, so nginx config needs to be exactly http://127.0.0.1:3001 and sudo snap set wekan port='3001'. Moved to #1596. Docker Hub images of wekanteam/wekan are usually broken, as is said at releases page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases/\nIf you use Docker, you should use Quay Docker image.\nNginx needs to have websocket etc settings configured properly:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config\nYou need to have ROOT_URL setting configured to your real Nginx wekan URL set correctly, so that card does open.\nFor me, using Snap version works correctly with shared boards, I can open cards, so I am unable to reproduce this.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. Please try the following:\n1) Stop wekan-app container, and backup mongodb container:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\n2) docker-compose stop your Wekan Docker version\n3) Install snap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\n4) Ensure that wekan.mongodb is running with sudo snap services. If it's not running, reinstall Wekan with sudo snap remove wekan && sudo snap install wekan\n5) Stop Wekan container with sudo snap stop wekan.wekan, as described at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Backup-and-restore\n6) Restore data with mongorestore --drop --port 27019\n7) Start wekan with sudo snap start wekan.wekan\n8) Set root-url to your nginx address: sudo snap set wekan root-url='https://example.com/wekan'\n9) Set port to your port where you have nginx proxy to: sudo snap set wekan port='3001' , etc settings mentioned at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\n10) Try again, does it work now.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/v0.83/Dockerfile#L37. I presume this is some database migration issue like #1576. Node version should not affect any functionality. You could look is there something missing in MongoDB database, with a tool like Robo 3T. Some previous issues were because somebody did delete some data on MongoDB directly, with some script, etc.\nYou can also try to export all boards as Wekan JSON files, and import them to new Wekan v0.85 Docker install.. I don't know could this be related to adding browser-policy etc in v0.80\nYou could try friend docker image that currently does not have those:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/friend/docker-compose.yml#L61\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:friend. This does not happen when using caddy that's integrated to Wekan Snap. So it's just Nginx config issue.. Usually problem in Nginx config is, that there are some other settings that prevent Wekan working, for example forbidden file extensions, etc. Usually Wekan in separate wekan-website.conf file and it's own subdomain makes Nginx work. That Nginx config should be like this:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config\nBut I have had server where was existing Drupal website, and I tried to add Wekan to work on that same domain sub-url like https://example.com/wekan , and some Drupal PHP settings did prevent it from working.\nI have also used Nginx at work, and tried to configure it to not show some random links on Drupal website, not finding good documentation about that.\nI have also used Certbot to renew Nginx Let's Encrypt SSL certs, and having to write various scripts to make it really work. Sometimes Certbot has messed up Nginx configs, or there has been need to build newest version directly from Certbot GitHub repo, or add additional commandline options.\nI also did help recently someone to run Wekan behind Apache, it did work fine.\nCaddy https://caddyserver.com renews Let's Encrypt SSL certs automatically.\nI would prefer that Wekan works behind any webserver.\nI really welcome all Nginx gurus to help debug this Nginx config issue.. Here is the Apache config:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Apache. Hmm, maybe this is only about misunderstanding about what root-url and port settings are?\nExamples:\n1) only wekan, no SSL, internal lan, caddy not enabled:\n- root-url='http://192.168.1.150'\n- port='80'\n=> Wekan locally http://192.168.1.150\n2) only wekan, no SSL, internal lan, caddy not enabled, wekan at different port:\n- root-url='http://192.168.1.150:5000'\n- port='5000'\n=> Wekan locally http://192.168.1.150:5000\n3) wekan's caddy SSL, available at internet:\n- root-url='https://example.com'   or https://example.com/wekan or https://wekan.example.com\n- port='3001'\n- Caddyfile example\n=> Wekan at https://example.com\n4) nginx SSL or without SSL, available at internet:\n- root-url='https://example.com'   or https://example.com/wekan or https://wekan.example.com , or with http\n- port='3001'\n- Nginx example, proxying to local port 3001\n=> Wekan at https://example.com\nWekan anyway runs http server on local port, so it is without SSL. To get SSL, some webserver like Caddy and Nginx that have SSL, can proxy to local Wekan http port where node.js runs.\nCould someone clarify to me, is there some bug, and how can I reproduce it?. Yes, this bug is fixed. For some old boards there could be some data that still shows this issue, but for newly created boards link to card works.. @zebby76 \nHave you tested this with newest Wekan ?. @mxmehl \nFor fixing old boards, it can help to export and import board.\nI do have example database where one board did not load, and export/import did help. I will look at differences between those boards how I could fix all boards automatically for everyone.\n. @mxmehl \nSorry, I have not had time yet to look at how to fix old boards. Direct links works on new boards on Caddy webserver for me.. There is no need to create new issues for these.\nYou can use my Commercial Support for new features, or develop those features yourself, or have some developer in your company develop them. We welcome all contributions.\n1) Logging date and time of all activity with summary reports\nOnly in-use Wekan data is kept in MongoDB database. If every possible little action etc logging would be kept in MongoDB, database would grow a lot quickly. That's why actual logging is preferred to be kept in separate logging system or database.\nWekan has some logging features, like Winston logger, you could test does it work:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#Stats\n\nDaily export of Wekan changes as JSON to Logstash and\nElasticSearch / Kibana (ELK)\nStatistics Python script for Wekan Dashboard\nConsole, file, and zulip logger on database changes with fix to replace console.log by winston logger\n\n2) Requesting reason for changing card to other column\nWekan does not have this feature currently.. @pcactr \n\nIncrease ulimit for node\nuse Fibers fixed node from Sandstorm binary or tar.gz package from https://releases.wekan.team , see Wekan GitHub repo changelog and commits in Dockerfile and snapcraft.yaml and wekan/server/authentication.js for Node 100% CPU usage fixes. Node 100% CPU usage info is kept up-to-date at\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nand\nhttps://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9796\n\nI do copy latest node binary from sandstorm, it seems that Sandstorm node had one additional fix, so I need to copy it again.\nCurrently I do use latest MongoDB 3.2.x for Wekan, although previous versions could work also.\nYou can also test does Wekan work better in Firefox.. Sorry, I can not do anything to the fact that Firefox ESR and Chrome are slow. I have for a long time mostly used newest Firefox Quantum, because it's so fast. I develop Wekan on Intel Core 2 Duo laptop that has SSD and 8 GB RAM and I have not noticed that it would be slow.. That slowness could be also related to amount of Javascript in current Meteor.js framework, it will be faster when I figure out how to upgrade all Wekan dependencies so that upgrading to newer version of Meteor.js is possible. There is less Javascript code and more optimizations in newer version.\nSome upcoming bugfixes to Meteor could also improve performance.. Maybe. You can Google search how to reduce polling interval in Meteor, read some Wekan code enough to understand where to add fix, and submit pull request to devel branch.\nWekan already has code to stop polling when browser tab is not active, and start polling when tab is activated again.. Yes, you are welcome to look at it, like anyone else. Required skills are just reading English (or translating with Google Translate etc), and making google searches, and following step-by-step instructions, trying does it work. Having someone with time to do that is all that is required to fix some bug or add some feature.. Please test newest Wekan v1.39. There has been speedups in Wekan v1.37 and v1.38. CPU usage also seems to be lower.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md. At #1672 there was some discussion about serverside resource usage. But from this issue it seems that once there is enough CPU resources at server, serverside is not the problem.\nProblem seems to be Wekan boards that have a lot of cards.\nHere above is mention about polling interval of meteor. Here is one comment about that:\nhttps://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9796#issuecomment-411373831 :\n\nsmeijer commented 24 days ago\nJust wanted to let know that I haven't experienced this issue anymore since I've replaced a lot of meteor publications with apollo/graphql requests.\nThe reactivity is thereby lost, but in my case a 30sec poll is also fine. On the places that I do require reactivity, I only publish a single timestamp. This timestamp is passed through to apollo, which triggers a refetch when the timestamp is changed.\nThe discussion here has also been helpful to improve performance here and there.\n\nSo I'm thinking, is apollo/graphql the right way to go.. In general, it would be good to know what is the correct part to optimize, to it have any effect.. It seems apollo is here https://github.com/cult-of-coders/apollo. Those texts have not been made translateable yet.. @zebby76 \nDo you have time to look at this?. @zebby76 \nwekan-export-import-fix-test.json.zip\nBefore exporting, it looks like this:\n\nAfter importing, it looks like this, and I can not drag lists:\n\nThis is on latest Wekan v0.89 Snap I released today:\n\n. @zebby76 \nThanks! That pull request makes imported board sortable.\nAlthough when I export and import that Wekan board, lists are imported to wrong order.. Moved to #1623. @Gobliins\nPlease try newest Wekan v1.00, and add animated gif and screenshot mockups about how it works currently, and what way you would like it to work, so I understand better.. No reply received.. @Gobliins \nPlease try newest Wekan v1.00, and add animated gif and screenshot mockups about how it works currently, and what way you would like it to work, so I understand better.. No reply received.. Current way it works, is because of all previous bugfixes etc to functionality. Card opens to side, so that I can scroll that card down while card is open. Etc. I don't see any bug here.. If someone has improvements to this, please add pull request.. @Unpluralized \nWekan already has Copy Checklist Teamplate to Many Cards.. Other features of card repeater belong to IFTTT https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1160. Private boards? Don't you mean public boards?. @Inkura \nYou don't have websockets enabled in your webserver. See:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Apache. Well, Wekan works for me with Caddy and Nginx. You could have some typos in your Apache config.. Public boards don't work currently. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1623. Have you set ROOT_URL=https://tg-wekan.herokuapp.com ?. At beginning users only see their own Welcome board. You need to add users to shared boards.\nAlso check that your root-url settings are correct. Did you add this setting for Wekan?\nport='8000'. How did you install Wekan manually?. I have not made that installation guide.\nAll installation guides are here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nI would really recommend using snap, it's fastest to install.\n. @andresmanelli \nI did not yet get that code working, you could test it more.. Hmm, I'll include this just for testing. Maybe I'm just not testing it correctly.. @brend @simopaasisalo \nIs this fixed now?. I did include this in latest release v0.92. @robisonr \nAdded to where? That line is already at Wekan v0.95:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/models/users.js#L498\nWhat version are you running?\nCould someone please verify is this still a problem still in latest Wekan?. @robisonr \nWhat addition you made to database?. Does @andresmanelli or somebody other have time to make pull request, that inserts profile.boardView property and setting it to \"board-view-lists\" ? So it does not need to be set manually? I'm currently busy with other unrelated work.. @zebby76 \nDo you have possibility to add another pull request that fixes npm lint errors? See developer docs at Wekan GitHub wiki.. @zebby76 \nNevermind, I got those lint errors fixed.. @szeberli \nThis is about Import from Trello, not import from Wekan-Export. Please add new issue.. @lime918 \nDoes the link itself work when pasted directly to browser URL bar ?\nIt seems that your link has onenote: in the beginning.\nTo create link correctly, use markdown syntax like this:\n[Meeting notes](http://path/to/notebook/notebook.one#section_name&section-id={...}&page-id={...}&end)\nThen it will be shown this way in Wekan description:\nMeeting notes. I'm guessing that it could be some of these:\na) Wekan's xss protection that is at package.json file\nb) in v0.80 added browser-policy that is at Meteor package versions file\nI don't yet know how I could go around those.. @lime918 \nI don't know yet, how well browsers would allow it.\nSomeone could look at current xss package options etc.\nThis is related to #1676 and #142 so after those maybe something could be possible.. What version of Wekan did you export from?. Try:\n1) Backup your MongoDB data\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\n2) Upgrade to newest Wekan Docker version\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nNewest Docker image is listed at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:v0.89\nYou can also use docker commands\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Docker\nSo you could stop and remove old container and image, and start new one with docker run.\nWhen you start new Wekan image, it upgrades MongoDB database to newest version.\n3) You can then on MongoDB \nchange yourself as admin so you see Admin Panel and change you as board admin.\nIf you import MongoDB data to MongoDB installed outside of Docker, or MongoDB is exposed to outside of docker, you can edit MongoDB with GUI like Robo3T https://robomongo.org\n. @dopaminereceptionist \nOf course JSON Import/Export will work in future releases. There has been fixes to that in today's release too. Please see #1602 for more info.\nAFAIK I did not say that Import/Export is not supported. Also see changelog on GitHub repo, Wekan has very active development.. The breakages in JSON Import/Export functionality are because there have been new features added to Wekan, for example Swimlanes etc, and not all of Wekan's code have been modified to add support for those new database tables/fields etc.\nAnyone can help support Wekan development with their pull requests and using my Commercial Support. I really welcome more beginners starting to read Wekan code and make modifications, submit their first pull request.. I can't add version number to old released versions, that would require complicated re-releasing.\nYes, Wekan could have tests added, and to make it possible to upgrade from all possible previous versions of Wekan. I'll check is there issue about that, and add new one if there is not issue yet.. There is tests issue at #467. @martinbruno90 \n1) Please make screenshot mockup about what kind of summary you do mean.\n2) Please make screenshot mockups how it would work like in different steps.\n3) There in Calendar issue #808 in progress, there received/start/due/end dates will be shown in calendar. If you mean something different, please comment there at #808. @martinbruno90 \nAre you running old version of Wekan? There is no due dates etc in mockup above. Can you upgrade to newest Wekan?. @martinbruno90 \nStatus of card can be added with for example green color label with text \"Done\".\nLinked card features are not yet merged to Wekan, you can see screenshots at Linked card pull request. I need to test how well it works.. @martinbruno90 \nLatest version is v0.93, released today.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases. @lichtamberg \nPlease add:\n screenshot how it looks in 18px\n PR. Hmm, actually you already have screenshot. Looks good, please submit PR.. @lichtamberg \nMaybe it just takes time to get active.. This does not seem to look right yet. Checkbox is upper than the text description on the right side of checkbox. Also, there is too much space between lines of checkboxes+descriptions.. I did see that some versions ago, but not after it.\nTry Wekan version from experimental Sandstorm App Market. Anyway, I've been thinking about enabling seeing all boards at Sandstorm version of Wekan, and removing more of the differences between Standalone and Sandstorm Wekan. Another reason for that is, when importing Wekan board, it says Board not found, and when importing new boards, there really is more that one board.. There could also be need to have some of the admin panel functionality inside Wekan grain itself, because I don't know will it be possible to remove users from Wekan board from Sandstorm menus itself.. If I get help to make user management working directly on Sandstorm side, it would sure be better.. I could not even get Wekan API enabled on Sandstorm at #1279 , because I could not figure out how to make permissions correct for API. I did just get permission denied errors, tried to add detecting sandstorm headers etc, and did not get it working yet correctly.\nSo for that, and also Sandstorm user management, I would need to have someone giving tips to where in code to try to do modifications.. @ertanalytics \nDid upgrading Wekan help? There is upgrade popup about Wekan in Sandstorm installs, because it's now in official Sandstorm App Market.\n. @hpvb \nPlease add animated gif video as comment to this issue, about what is happening.. You did close \"Sign In\" popup. Sharing is only to those users that can login to same server, and click Sign-in. It is not shared to anonymous users, that feature only works in Standalone Wekan. In Sandstorm Admin, it's also possible to limit for example that only users from example.com domain using Google Auth can login.\n\n. I don't know is this bug in Wekan or Sandstorm, as there has been a lot of changes, or has this feature worked sometime before.. In Stanalone Wekan there is Public/Private button at board header where board name and search button is, like can be seen at https://wekan.github.io screenshot. I'll try making Private/Public button visible at Sandstorm to see does it help.. @luxas0072 \nAnyone that has time can fix this bug, see:\nhttps://blog.wekan.team/2018/05/wekan-v1-00-released/index.html. @luxas0072 \nYes, if you still have problems. Anyway, docker hub image is usually broken, as you see on releases page, so you should use quay image. And, snap is easier to install than Docker, and snap updates automatically.. @ChronikEwok \nCan you make a pull request?\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/. @ChronikEwok\nThanks for your fix! Would you like to have $15 bounty from this issue? If yes, you can claim it at BountySource.\nAnother alternative is to give that bounty to me, to support my maintaining of Wekan.\nWhat would you like to do?. Moved to #1563. @therampagerado \nTry cleanup scripts:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-cleanup. @udvarit \nThanks! I added it to wekan cleanup repo wiki:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-cleanup/wiki/Empty-Recycle-Bin-from-exported-JSON-with-PHP. Recycle Bin has now been renamed to Archive.. @ThisNeko \nI get this lint error:\nwekan/models/cards.js\n  502:9  error  Expected property shorthand  object-shorthand\nCan you add fix for that?. Nevermind, I already fixed that lint error.. @thiagofernando \nPlease remove translation changes to other than i18n/en.i18n.json, see https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1470#issuecomment-364171034\nThanks!\n. How this works?\nI don't see \"Allow Username Change\" option in Admin Panel / Settings / Accounts, in file\nwekan/client/components/settings/settingBody.jade\nDid I build it wrong? Or is there such option?. @carlos22 \nThat's because GitHub introduced release file size limitations.\nNewest releases are at:\nhttps://releases.wekan.team\nDocker, Source etc instructions are at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nI don't know how well Docker works on FreeBSD, can you use it:\nhttps://wiki.freebsd.org/Docker. @carlos22 \nI copied your gist to Wekan GitHub wiki, please add modifications directly to there. Thanks!\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/SmartOS. Export boards, and import them to new install of Wekan Snap.. One way to do this manually, is that when updating:\n1) Shutdown other Wekan Docker containers, and only leave one Wekan Docker container running.\n2) Then do the update, let migrations finish.\n3) Start other containers.. @hever \nPlease give screenshots how did you get it to not show checklist items. Because checklist items are visible to me on Wekan v0.95. I'm unable to duplicate this.. Are you running old version of Wekan? That null problem was fixed some versions ago.. Moved to #1603. @franksiler\nCan you try to add that fix directly to Wekan itself as pull request?. Ok. I'll leave this open anyway so that someone (or me) can look at this later.. Do you use quay Docker image?\nDo you use Firefox?\nI tried it, and Search etc is always visible, when board is open. This is with existing old Wekan data, and new clean install, on Docker and Snap, both work. I'm unable to duplicate this.. Please record animated gif video about what is the problem.\nI tried this in Firefox and Chrome incognito mode:\n1) Login to Wekan\n2) Click board to open board\n3) Filter, search etc is visible.\nI don't understand what is the problem.. I'm unable to duplicate this.. @d3dbit \nSorry, I can not duplicate your issue, I'm using Wekan v1.04 snap.. Depends if you find anything easier to use.\n\nNginx with Certbot is a pain to keep up-to-date, I have needed to make custom build scripts for updating Certbot directly from GitHub repo. There are instructions at Wekan GitHub wiki how to use Nginx or Apache. I have configured Nginx at work for many years, and I don't like Nginx at all. I have had many problems with Nginx. Nginx for commercial use is even more expensive than Caddy.\nCaddy is only commercial, if you use prebuilt binary from website. If Caddy is compiled from source, it's free also for commercial use. Caddy has MITM detections and other security features that other webservers do not have.\nI have used Hiawatha, but had problems with it, so for my usage I have switched to Caddy.\nPlease give details what webserver would really be better than Caddy. Webserver should have automatic Let's Encrypt SSL cert updates integrated.. When installing Wekan snap, Caddy is not enabled by default, and Wekan works without SSL and without enabling Caddy. Is it a problem that snap includes Caddy ?. If I remove Caddy from current Wekan snap, that will break every server where Caddy snap is enabled, including https://releases.wekan.team server that is running Wekan snap's enabled Caddy. I don't know how current Caddy configs could automatically be migrated to other webserver configs.\nI could maybe create another snap with other name, but that would be a lot of work, and create confusion.\n\nI'm open to any suggestions how all this could be solved, and what the benefits are.. Existing options are described in ROOT_URL settings at releases page:\n- Only Wekan node.js\n- Caddy in front of Wekan (not enabled by default)\n- Nginx in front of Wekan\nAnd also at Wiki additionally:\n- Apache in front of Wekan\n- Traefik in front of Wekan with self-signed SSL certs. There is also possibility to use proxy. It's also possible to use Docker version, that does not include Caddy.\nDocker version does not have automatic updaters, so it requires some update script, or managing with DockerBunker, that has Wekan support:\nhttps://github.com/chaosbunker/dockerbunker\nor alternatively, any other software that manages Docker containers.\nI don't think there is any actual problem here. If someone still likes to discuss this, add comment to this issue.\nClosing issue.. Yes. Standalone Wekan has example LDAP code, but it's not integrated yet. https://sandstorm.io has LDAP etc.\nMoved to #119. Moved to #807. Moved to #807 . @feuerball11\nDon't care about Codacy. It makes wrong suggestions.\nOnly npm run lint is important.\nI will remove Codacy.. I did leave codacy as it is. Having npm run lint without errors is more important anyway.. Most likely you have some misconfigured webserver in front of Wekan.\nI recommend installing Wekan Snap with Caddy for SSL to Ubuntu 18.04 server:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. Did you use snap to install wekan? Do you have enough RAM for Wekan, for example 2 GB ? What Linux version you have? What kernel version?. No reply received.. Here is how to install Wekan on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. Max versions:\n- Meteor 1.6.0.1\n- Node 8.11.1 or newer 8.x, currently using performance patched version from https://releases.wekan.team\n- MongoDB 3.2.x. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan.hx. Please try newest Wekan first. There is no fixes coming to old versions of Wekan.. Those are random bots at internet, trying to find vulnerable phpmyadmin etc. Wekan does not have phpmyadmin.\nYour docker-compose.yml should have line like this, so that Wekan works at address http://52.47.144.72 without port number 80:\n- ROOT_URL=http://52.47.144.72. That would require more sponsors for scalability work, see my Commercial Support, that would be much cheaper than paying for Trello for that amount of users. There is beginnings of Roadmap for wekan.hx with frontend without javascript, that would provide best scalability with least server resources required.\nCurrent bugs in Node.js and Meteor.js framework cause high CPU usage.. Done and in progress performance improvements are listed in this blog post:\nhttps://blog.wekan.team/2018/01/wekan-progress-on-x64-and-arm/index.html\nNode and Meteor developers have bug fixing in progress, there is links to those issues in blog post.. @therampagerado \nYour main problem is those cards at recycle bin. Getting those deleted would help a lot.. There are still a lot of ways to improve performance in current version of Wekan.. @d3dbit \nIt's better to move old cards to another board.. @d3dbit \nIf you use Standalone Wekan, you can export board that has old cards to JSON file, move board to recycle bin, and delete board from recycle bin. If you sometime need old cards back, you can import JSON file.. @rjevnikar \nIt's already possible to move cards to another board. Although, there is not yet feature to move list to another board, or move recycle bin content to another board.\nIt would also help if someone can add/fix feature to empty recycle bin #1625. There are 2 recycle bins that would need adding/fixing: on All Boards page Board - Recycle Bin, and on single board page card/swimlane/etc Recycle Bin.. Please test newest Wekan v1.39. There has been speedups in Wekan v1.37 and v1.38. CPU usage also seems to be lower.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md. Moved to here from #1870\nFrom @a5dev \n\nDid you test in newest Wekan?: Yes\n\nI have Wekan set to auto update and it\u2019s using the latest build. When we test it with only about 12-15 users, Wekan will become unresponsive. At first we thought the workstations needed more RAM (thinking since it is a JS app all of the work was offloaded to the clients). But that did not resolve the issue.\nNext we bumped up the Wekan VM to 4 processors and 24gb of RAM. Tested again but it still crashes/becomes unresponsive after using for only 10 minutes.\nThe latest thing we noticed was that in linux (the wekan server), the Node process is running up to 100%. Is there a way to optimize node or make a node cluster? Or is there a parameter in the Wekan config that needs to be changed?\nWondering how other organizations are able to use Wekan.. For latest Wekan some user reported that adding index to MongoDB did return CPU usage to normal. But that can depend on server configuration.\nFor fast single CPU core usage, at AWS C4 instance type has most raw CPU power, according to this:\nhttps://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=229648\nFor cheap dedicated servers, for example there is Hetzner:\nhttps://www.hetzner.com/?country=en\nAt AWS, it's possible to setup for example ECS cluster:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/AWS\nAnd I do plan to make it possible to move files outside of MongoDB #142 \nFor MongoDB, there is issue about adding index to Wekan #1709 , that could probably help too.\nI welcome any help with testing and debugging performance.. Moved to #1600. @QWERTYman2020 \nWhat language you use in browser settings and in Wekan?\nTry some of these:\n- 30/05/2018 11.00 A\n- 30/05/2018 11.00 AM\n- 30/05/2018 11:00\n- 30/05/2018 11:00 A\n- 30/05/2018 11:00 AM\n- 05/30/2018 11.00 A\netc. Please somebody add pull request to migrations:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/migrations.js. @john-pallissard \nWhat version of Wekan you use?

Or do you have other ways to protect from security issue?. I have adding iframe settings in progress:\nhttps://gist.github.com/xet7/09d84ee2fd91649ecd75bae42461460d\nTODO: Add Snap, Docker etc settings. browser-policy docs are here:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/meteor/browser-policy.

This is already in Wekan since Wekan v1.22, and some fixes have been added after it.\nSnap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nDocker:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L125-L135\nSource:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/start-wekan.sh#L19-L27. @florianproxi \nThat is more of bash / cron question than Wekan question.\nYou can look at this bash example:\nhttps://github.com/xet7/admin-scripts/blob/master/move-old-irclogs.sh\nAnd this crontab page:\nhttps://crontab.guru\nAfter you have made backup script, you can add it to this wiki page directly:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data\nThanks!. @DrGraypFroot \nYou can add it directly to this wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup\nThanks!. Yes, someone could add these to scripts:\n```\ndocker stop wekan-app\ndocker start wekan-app\nsudo snap stop wekan.wekan\nsudo snap start wekan.wekan\n```\nThanks!. @rjevnikar \nThanks a lot for your amazing work!\nIt would be much easier if you could create separate pull request for each feature, because some of these features are ready, and some are not. That way I could test and merge them separately. Having them together in one pull request means that all features need to be ready before merging, and it's harder to test in what feature each bug is.\n1) Additional label colors: Seems to work, I'll need to test with export/import later.\n2) Board Delete: Seems to work, but it should be in All Boards / Recycle Bin - at right side of Restore Board buttons. delete-board button seems to not be translated, there is still text delete-board when Wekan is running, instead of text Delete Board.\n3) Assigned & Requested By text fields: add buttons does not work, when I have existing Wekan data and added your feature, maybe migration is missing.\nWekan card originally looks like this:\n\nAfter adding Assigned & Requested By text fields it looks like this:\n\nSo layout is broken.. After migration added, Reguested By / Assigner By Add-buttons don't work yet.. @rjevnikar \nThanks, you have great progress!\nNow in browser right client / Inspect Element / Console, there is error about multiple templates:\n\n. @rjevnikar\nThanks, great progress!\n\nCard layout is now fixed\nYou did add Delete Board button to All Boards / Recycle Bin, but it should be on right side, like this: Board name [Restore Board] [Delete Board], and Delete Board button does not work yet.\nAssigned By / Received By Add-buttons do not work yet\nDelete Board button is not yet removed from single Board hamburger menu. @rjevnikar \n\nThat Travis build error is my fault, I copied newest Sandstorm fork version of Node.js from Sandstorm to Wekan server, and forgot to update checksum. I will fix it.. Wekan will have Linked Cards and Linked Boards feature, it's in progress https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1592. Fixed already.. Details: fixed here https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/90d55777f7298d243ed0de03c934cea239a31272. @PuShaoWei \nIf you are only installing Wekan, easiest way is to use Snap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\nIf you are developing feature or bugfix for Wekan, install from source instructions are here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases. Works in Wekan v1.39.0~2018-08-29 at Sandstorm, using Chrome on Linux.. @Kels\nI have mentioned about Swimlane color here, but nobody has started developing it yet:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1592\nYou can see what different Swimlane color would look like here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1160\nThere are existing features in Wekan how to change board and label color.\nMain problem is that this would need someone that has time to read the code and add changing color to swimlane menu.\nYou can see code for boards, cards, swimlanes etc here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/client/components\nIt's easy for anyone that has used any programming language to figure it out, as you can see here:\nhttps://blog.wekan.team/2018/05/wekan-v1-00-released/index.html\nYou can add Swimlane color feature, I can help with any questions you have. You can add questions as comments to this issue.. @bentiss \nCan you try adding swimlane background color, with Set Color option in Swimlane hamburger menu? Similar like there is card color?. @bentiss \nList color is described at feature request here: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/328#issuecomment-396431410\nFrom @DeGroote99\n\nI have requested this feature, instead of the entire section being colored, just the list name in a colored box. much cleaner look. @bentiss \n\nYes, colorizing headers is much better. Filling background makes it look terrible. It would be better to get nice background image to Wekan board, like in your kanbanize option.. Here is related background image issue #486. There is also related card-specific avatar color issue #2110. In general, there has been a lot of work done to make Wekan beautiful enough. Wekan users do stare Wekan boards all days along, so Wekan should look like something usable.. @bentiss \n+ Add Swimlane should be just + button at left side of every swimlane hamburger menu button.. And that + button would create new swimlane below of current swimlane.. You could improve it:\n- make swimlane borders more visible\n- make Add Card / Add Swimlane etc texts more visible\n- etc, to make grey areas as dark or black, so more is visible\nAfter these changes, please add your new script as comment to this issue.. With that smaller layout, there are these I'm thinking:\n- There could be more board links at top. How would it behave nicely in that case?\n- There is very short board name in your screenshot above. In your case, it fits to top, but some boards have much longer names, like seen at https://wekan.github.io . There could be some CSS rules to display it nicely if text is longer.\n- Standalone Wekan has top bar visible, but Sandstorm Wekan does not. This is because there is only one board visible at Sandstorm, and admin settings are at Sandstorm Admin Panel, not Wekan panel.\nI need to think how this could work. Ideas welcome.. There are anyway CSS etc that makes top bar different on Standalone Wekan and Sandstorm Wekan, so that is not an issue. Mostly this just needs testing so that it behaves properly when there is more board links and longer board title.. It could be improved:\n- Starred board list goes over board title, if list is too long. It could be made scrollable to right and left.\n- If board title is long, search button etc disappears. Title could be made scrollable.. I made some changes. It still has some bugs, does not scroll when needed, etc.\n\n```js\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name         Kanban\n// @namespace    https://wekan.github.io\n// @version      0.1\n// @match        https://wekan.indie.host/*\n// @grant        none\n// ==/UserScript==\n(function() {\n    const el = document.createElement(\"style\")\n    el.textContent = `\n/ body { background-color: white; } /\nheader #header-main-bar {\nposition: absolute;\nright: 100px;\nleft: 300px;\ntop: -3px;\npadding: 0;\nheight: calc(28px + 3px);\n}\n/ .wekan-logo, .js-member, .attachments-galery { display: none; } /\n/ .swimlane { background-color: white; } /\n.swimlane-header-wrap { border: 0 !important; }\n.swimlane-header { text-overflow: initial !important; }\n/\n.swimlane .list-header { margin: 4px 12px 4px; }\n.swimlane .list-header-name { display: none; }\ndiv:nth-child(1 of .swimlane) .list-header { margin: 20px 12px 4px; }\ndiv:nth-child(1 of .swimlane) .list-header-name { display: inline; }\n/\n.list { border: 0; flex: 300px 0 0; }\n/ .list { border: 0; background-color: white; flex: 300px 0 0; }\n.list .open-minicard-composer { display: none; }\n/\n.list .open-list-composer { opacity: 0; transition: opacity .2s; }\n.list .open-list-composer:hover { opacity: 1; }\n.list .list-body { height: 200px; padding: 0 2px; }\n.minicard-wrapper { margin-bottom: 2px !important; }\n.minicard { box-shadow: 0 0px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset; }\n/*\n.swimlane .list:nth-child(2) .minicard { opacity: .5 !important; }\n.swimlane .list:nth-last-child(2) .minicard { opacity: .1 !important; }\n.pop-over-list .js-labels { display: none }\n.pop-over-list .js-move-card-to-top { display: none }\n.pop-over-list .js-move-card-to-bottom { display: none }\n.pop-over-list .js-archive { color: darkred }\n*/\n.card-details {\nposition: absolute;\nz-index: 10000 !important;\ntop: 0;\nbottom: 0;\nleft: calc(50% - 510px / 2);\n}\n`\n    document.body.appendChild(el)\n})();\n```\n. @GuillaumeAmat \nPlease everybody, describe with screenshot and tampermonkey script examples:\n- how we get Wekan top bar fitting to one line\n- only have one menu where is all these Lists / Swimlanes / Calendar options visible, including search, etc, that it is not multiple clicks, and does work on mobile web\n- how we improve UI. So not only removing inner shadow, but making it to look different than Trello.\n- how there could be less buttons, or more simplicity\n- with what colors board can be made better visible to those with older eyes. For example, some light buttons to darker, bigger contrast. But not too bright, so eyes don't get tired so fast.\n- any other ways to improve UI.\n- making UI more logical and easier to understand.. @GuillaumeAmat \nOf course discussion is possible. I just don't know what most Wekan users want.\n\n@pravdomil suggested inner shadow. @DeGroote99 liked it. I added it.\n@pravdomil changed his mind, and did not want inner shadow. @GuillaumeAmat did not want inner shadow. Problem with other suggestions were that having all white display is too bright for my eyes.\nI asked for more UI suggestions and opened this issue again. @pravdomil closed this issue again.\n\nIn general, Wekan UI is a compromise to have it usable for most users. There is white board color option etc. Sometimes change somebody has added needs to be removed or modified, if usability is not so good. In general, there will be new features and bug fixes for Wekan. Wekan is Open Source with MIT license, and Wekan is community effort. And many times I am wrong, make mistakes, etc. That's why I ask for bug reports, comments, feature requests etc, because I don't know what would be best for most users. . @pravdomil \nPlease forgive me, and don't close this issue.. I will remove inner shadow when I have some free time. Currently it's late at night.\nThere is enough work to fix bugs in current theme. It is too much work to create custom theme and keep it working with all frequent changes.\nChanging colors, custom logo, etc are already on roadmap.\nUpdate: I did remove inner shadow some releases ago.. @rwatts3 \nI will add some possibility to add html/css sometime this or next month.\nWhat do you mean with adding javascript? For what purpose?. Well, I did break Rocket.Chat with custom javascript, so I needed a way to fix it:\nhttps://forums.rocket.chat/t/big-issue-with-custom-javascript/261/2\nSure it's also possible to break Wekan layout with custom CSS, so probably I will add some URL where to go when logged in as admin to remove custom CSS.. Hmm, if custom CSS prevents login, maybe it should be snap command.... There will be option for adding custom css in near future. I have development in progress.. Custom CSS will be at Admin Panel Layout page, with input box and save button.. I wrote this to FAQ entry so I can refer to it later:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ#policy-about-wekan-ui-changes. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Custom-CSS-themes. @therampagerado \nMaybe it's this in progress work https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1685 by @rjevnikar \nI presume there will be more changes done later.. @therampagerado \nPlease read #1668 about what is currently in progress to be fixed..

I have not tried it yet. At links above about Sandstorm and Snap is more details. I have not looked what board name needs to be at sandstorm - most likely it's \"sandstorm\".. At that Sandstorm link above you also see how to see database details with Robo 3T, what are the differences etc..

Moved to #1256. @TastyPlacement \nTry:\na) Snap\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\nb) DockerBunker\nhttps://github.com/chaosbunker/dockerbunker. But, if you are on OVH or OpenVZ servers, only building from source works:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/tree/master/virtualbox\n. @Asgoret \nMaybe Docker would work for OpenShift?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nOr some other platform?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases\nOpenShift is part of not tested platforms. If you get it running, please add new wiki page, and link to it:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms#not-tested-yet\n. Moved to #182. Done already. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/OAuth2#auth0. ## Status\nCurrently I still am figuring how to get single login working with Auth0, with Wekan+Rocket.Chat+WordPress+PHP script behind it. It would be helpful if there are others trying to this too, and would help with SSO cookies etc.\nCurrent settings I use are at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/OAuth2#auth0\nIt is possible to use Auth0 with Wekan OAuth2, but OAuth2 has bug that it logins always as first Admin user. After that is fixed, next step would be to get single login working, so that after Auth0 login (like linkedin/google/etc) user is logged into all apps including Wekan, without needing to click Wekan Oidc button or Rocket.Chat login button.\nSome links to Auth0 docs I got from support\n\nHow do I enable SSO, so that when someone logins at https://example.com/login , then it logins to all 3 apps at once?\n\nFor SSO best option is to implement universal login page. The universal login approach will store a session cookie on your tenant's domain for the user logging in.\nFor the Wordpress app, you can configure universal login from the Wordpress plugin's advance settings with the Auto Login option.\nFor PHP app, our reference applications can be useful.\n\nhttps://rocket.chat chat software, that is made with Meteor, chat software similar to Slack , installed to https://chat.example.com , configured with OAuth2 to have Auth0 login. (It also has SAML if needed).\n\nI guess you already implemented the login with OAuth2 for Rocket chat. I assume it should be with using the universal login page. If you can share a HAR file for it, I can have a better idea. You can find how to capture the HAR file here.\nTo have a better idea of how SSO works with Auth0, you may also check our sample here.\n\nDo you have ideas how do I find logout url to Rocket.Chat ? It could be possible to logout with Rocket.Chat API https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/ , but I don't know how to get Auth0 to call it.\n\nAuth0 logout endpoint is meant only to end the session for the shared session cookie. It is the app's responsibility to clear any sessions/cookies of their own. So in your case, you first need to call the rocket API to logout from the app itself and then redirect to the Auth0 logout endpoint to clear the SSO session managed by Auth0.\n\nAt Wekan REST API there is login https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API#summary but not logout yet, so I maybe need to add logout url for Wekan?\n\nThis is beyond our control. As in the previous case, you need to clear any session for wekan from the app itself and then redirect to Auth0's logout endpoint.\n\nHow do I maintain logged in status in WP+Rocket.Chat+Wekan+PHP script so that when logout is done on some app, then it does logout of all apps, and goes to specified URL ?\n\nCurrently, we don't support backchannel logout. Which means that, if a user logs out from one app using the logout endpoint, we clear the shared session cookie for all; however, there isn't a mechanism to send a message to the apps opened in the other tabs of the browser.\nBut when the other apps try to refresh their session with the silent authentication, Auth0 will reply with the login required prompt and won't send new access/id tokens.. It seems that Auth0 has only experimental support for LDAP, and OAuth2 still has bug. But probably LDAP, OAuth2 etc is not needed at all.\nNext I will try Auth0.js mentioned at universal login page. \nI would think that Auth0.js code should work like this:\n1) Check is there WP Auth0 SSO cookie, when user comes to Wekan or Rocket.Chat login page\n2) Check does user exist in Wekan or Rocket.Chat\n3) If user exists, login automatically. \n4) If user does not exist, redirect to https://example.com/login\nI would think that 4) would work at webbrowser, and on mobile Rocket.Chat uses some mobile API so redirect would not prevent it from logging in with username and password. I have not tried it yet.. Related trying to get Auth0 working on OIDC issue \n@danpatdav \nThanks for your trying to help. Some more info that I have looked a little:\n1) Old 2016 repo about some Auth0 Meteor login code:\nhttps://github.com/prospa-group-oss/meteor-accounts-auth0\n2) 2019 forum post. There was Meteor example about Auth0 login, but when Auth0 was notified about security issue in it, they did not fix it, and took repo down. I don't understand why, because Auth0 has fixed other code examples.\nhttps://forums.meteor.com/t/migrating-auth-from-meteor-to-auth0-roadblocks/32778/5\n3) How login to get Profile info and get picture info with just Javascript on browserside:\nhttps://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-javascript-samples/tree/master/02-User-Profile\n4) OIDC SSO sample. If there are many apps, and some is already logged in, silently login to other app too:\nhttps://github.com/auth0-samples/oidc-sso-sample\n5) Meteor JWT sample. I did send PR to fix some bug in it, but I don't know does it actually login to Auth0, it seems to create new account to local database.\nhttps://github.com/auth0-blog/meteor-app\n6) Meteor Auth0 lock. I did send PR to upgrade it to Meteor 1.8.0.2, it's now accepted. \nhttps://github.com/xcv58/meteor-auth0\nBut it looks like it does not support passwordless email code login that I'm trying to use.. @danpatdav \nI did add info to wiki with what settings currently Auth0 passwordless email code login works to login to RocketChat: \nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/OAuth2#4-auth0-id-provider-to-custom-oauth-rocketchat. @danpatdav @salleman33\nWith these settings at Auth0, using Wekan v2.25 devel branch:\nexport DEBUG=true\n        export OAUTH2_ENABLED=true\n        export OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=12345                           \n        export OAUTH2_SECRET=54321                                                           \n        export OAUTH2_SERVER_URL=https://example.eu.auth0.com\n        export OAUTH2_AUTH_ENDPOINT=/authorize\n        export OAUTH2_USERINFO_ENDPOINT=/userinfo\n        export OAUTH2_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=/oauth/token\n        export OAUTH2_ID_MAP=sub\n        export OAUTH2_USERNAME_MAP=email\n        export OAUTH2_FULLNAME_MAP=name\n        export OAUTH2_EMAIL_MAP=email\nI get this debug response:\nXXX: userinfo: { sub: 'google-oauth2|12345678',\n  given_name: 'Joe',\n  family_name: 'Jackson',\n  nickname: 'x',\n  name: 'Joe Jackson',\n  picture: 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/..../photo.jpg',\n  gender: 'male',\n  locale: 'fi',\n  updated_at: '2019-02-25T12:49:26.768Z',\n  email: 'joe@example.org',\n  email_verified: true }\n{\"line\":\"431\",\"file\":\"oauth.js\",\"message\":\"Error in OAuth Server: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'null' in null\",\"time\":{\"$date\":1551098967397},\"level\":\"warn\"}\nException while invoking method 'login' { stack: 'TypeError: Cannot use \\'in\\' operator to search for \\'null\\' in null\\n    at packages/underscore.js:894:15\\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\\n    at _.each._.forEach (packages/underscore.js:139:11)\\n    at Function._.pick (packages/underscore.js:893:5)\\n    at Object.handleOauthRequest (packages/salleman_oidc.js:48:20)\\n    at OAuth._requestHandlers.(anonymous function) (packages/oauth2.js:27:31)\\n    at middleware (packages/oauth.js:203:5)\\n    at packages/oauth.js:176:5',\n  source: 'method' }\nSo in Auth0 Logs it looks like that login to Auth0 did work, and required info is at above response I think, but login to Wekan does not work with OIDC button.\nCan you help please?.

You should try to squash your commits and remove all the extra stuff, or add a new pull request.. @TNick\nSure you can also remove extra stuff directly in this pull request too, it's fine :+1:. @TNick \nPlease fix merge conflicts. Thanks!. @d3dbit \nFor migrating old to new Wekan database structure, migrations needs to be added, so database schema is upgraded.\nMongorestore and upgrading is not impacted, if migrations code exists.\nTrello import is impacted, if Trello JSON includes nested tasks. Those need to be converted to Wekan nested tasks.\nWekan JSON import/export needs to have nested tasks imported/exported, or ignored when importing older Wekan JSON.\nDatabase schema and import/export code is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/models\nWith this implementation of nested boards, if I understand correctly, it duplicates all boards so they have subboards containing all nested tasks. For example, if Wekan has 100 boards, it would be duplicated to 200 boards. I don't know how this would be visible to users, because I have not tested this yet, because of merge errors.. I have also not looked how this would compare to Linked Cards and Linked boards https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1592 , is there some overlap in funtionality, and which one would be better as design to base these features on.. At Sandstorm only one board is visible, with board name sandstorm. Importing has board not found bug. Each board is in separate grain, that increases security. I could enable seeing all boards in Sandstorm grain, although that would alter current user experience a lot, then probably all those not found boards could be seen. Getting Sandstorm bugs fixes would require a lot of time, because a lot of it is in Sandstorm internals etc. Most of my current customer work is for Standalone Wekan.. Moved to #1703. @pravdomil \nThanks for your pull request ! But I added that shadow myself, because I like it.. Thanks! After testing shadow, Wekan users now prefer not to have shadow. I will merge this soon.. Yes. I try to make install page more clear.. @TNick \nDoes this show card's Received/Start/Due/End dates in calendar?. @TNick \nI'll try it when I have some free time. Thanks!. Calendar issue at #808 . It also has bounties.. @TNick \nWhat kind of package, modules, imports/exports? Please give more details. Thanks!. @martin3785 \nAt card details, add due dates etc other dates. They will then show at calendar, I think. I have not tested it so well yet.. @sorbet510 \nI do see all my boards in board menu in Snap Wekan 1.07.\n$ sudo snap list\nName   Version  Rev   Tracking  Developer  Notes\ncore   16-2.33  4830  stable    canonical  core\nwekan  1.07     213   stable    xet7       -\nWhat Wekan version are you running?.

I'll make new fixed Wekan v1.10 release soon.. @kestrelhawk \nPlease try this Docker image, is this fixed now:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:v1.10. Moved to #802 . Moved to #1623. @sebastianha \nSure, there is new stuff, although still not finished in progess cutting edge.\n1) At newest Wekan v2.02 (see also OpenAPI issue for new API docs) there is using REST API to export whole board, after logging in to API as form data. So if export of that board still works with API, you could try that.\n2) There is way to fix MongoDB and export to JSON text and image etc files so you could see all of your data, but there is not yet ready-made script to insert data back to Wekan. That fix MongoDB data info is for all Wekan versions, not just Sandstorm Wekan.\n3) There are some cleanup code that could possibly help.\n4) There are some Wekan bugs with Custom Fields, Subtasks etc, that can cause Wekan board to not work, so by removing data related to those from MongoDB could work, or just waiting when some future Wekan version has that data fixed. Fixing import/export bugs is planned for Milestone 35 during next month February and continues also after that because one month is quite a short time for the amount of issues there.\n5) For Docker Wekan users, there newer Wekan Docker image image: quay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8 that works with MongoDB 4.x that most likely more MongoDB bugs fixed than previous versions of MongoDB. More details are at https://github.com/wekan/wekan file docker-compose.yml .\n6) If you are running at some cloud that provides hosted MongoDB, like recently announced MongoDB 3.6.x compatible service at AWS DocumentDB that has implemented in a such way that it implements MongoDB client API, but all of the backend code is scalable, safe and custom-made, you could use that as your MongoDB URL with Wekan Docker image mentioned at 5) above.\n7) Probably sometime Wekan could have support for some other databases, for example I have issue in progress at FoundationDB forums how to get Wekan working with FoundationDB, that has MongoDB compatibility layer. There is also FoundationDB fault tolerance demo at YouTube. More info at FoundationDB website. Although FoundationDB usually requires cluster, so it's not usual for smaller amount of data.\nSummary\nKeep at least daily backups. Well, for one client I did set backup for every 15 min, just to make sure.. Please make new pull request with only your changes, and not any of those old merges.. @ppoulard \n1) Keep your changes in some other directory on your directory.\n2) Delete your fork\n3) Make new fork from Wekan devel branch\n4) Add your changed files\n5) commit\n6) push\n7) make pull request.. @jcabillot \nHow? What packages and to what version? I did not get it to work, so that npm audit would not show warning anymore.. Well, if this bothers someone, someone can look at those components like minicard etc:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/edge/client/components\nSee what is different, make change, submit PR to edge branch.. Moved to #2011. Moved to #802. @Asgoret \nDid you reboot after installing Wekan? That is usually required.\nIs something else using port 3001 ? You can check with:\nsudo netstat -plant | grep :3001\nEnabling Caddy requires Caddy to use ports 80 and 443. Do you have some other webserver running already?\nCaddy usually proxies to Wekan port.. @Asgoret \nPlease set ROOT_URL correctly to your server IP address or domain:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install.

Actually, I think it's better that I set default value in migration, using your example. Thanks!. Hmm, I'm thinking that setting it in English value only could be problem for translations. I try optional first.. @centigrade-kdk \nThanks! I will fix it in next release.. Does exporting boards in Wekan 0.6 as Wekan JSON and importing to newest Wekan work?. If you have https in URL (for example with Nginx/Apache/Caddy), is https also in Wekan ROOT_URL ? If not, please add it, so it is real wekan URL.  See Settings:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings. @centigrade-thomas-becker \nWhat Wekan version you have? I don't see Wekan 0.6 In ChangeLog. @centigrade-kdk \nIt could be some shared board bug like #1623\nYes there was secury issue, details at https://wekan.github.io/hall-of-fame/\nAnd that did mean that anyone logged in could have browserside access to all user details, so that would enable any user to get admin credentials, create and delete users, delete all boards etc.\nI gladly welcome more contributors to help making Wekan more secure and more bug-free. Any company using Wekan should have developers in their company contributing to Wekan code, to make Wekan better.. @centigrade-kdk \nThe security fix was in v1.04  so it publishes people code collection on serverside and there seems to be some limit change.\nIt could also be related to users model or some component.\nOn serverside there is authentication etc.. @centigrade-kdk \nSend me email x@xet7.org , I read email often when I'm awake.. Moved to #1625. @Haocen \nNewest is Wekan v1.18.\nWhat other fixes you have?\nIs it possible that you submit all your fixes as pull request?\nI don't have enough time to switch to React, and nobody has contributed it.. @Haocen \nThanks! All improvements to Wekan are very welcome.. @Haocen \nCurrently Wekan is using Jade/Blaze etc, so I don't know how it would look in React. Any small component pull request would help me getting the idea.\nI did merge your mobile fixes a moment ago.\nNext I will look at upgrading perfect-scrollbar.\nThanks!. @Haocen \nNo problem, thanks for your help! It's normal to have bugs in new code, usually when I merge some new feature or fix it takes some time to fix bugs it includes.. @Haocen \nMobile navigation works much better with these fixes, thanks!. I tried newest perfect-scrollbar:\n```\nmeteor remove mquandalle:perfect-scrollbar\nmeteor npm install perfect-scrollbar\n```\nBut then when card is open, and card has many comments, scrollbar is not visible on card.\nThere could be some specific changes that mquandalle has made to his version.. @ppoulard \nCan you look at this ?. @pcurie \nhttps://atmospherejs.com/atoy40/accounts-cas\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1742. @d3dbit \nFrom what Wekan version JSON backup file is?. @d3dbit @hever \nPlease test with newest Wekan v1.34. Thanks!\n. @d3dbit @hever \nDoes this still happen on newest Wekan?. Goal in Wekan is always to add support for more browsers and fix browser bugs. For existing bugs known, there is already Wekan issues. If there is no open issue about some browser bug, please add it.. @illk \nWhat are you trying to delete?. Moved to #833. sudo snap set wekan port='5000'\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys. @hever \nDo you have newest Wekan v1.18.0 ? When I write card and press tab, nothing happens, and I still can then continue typing.. @hever \nI am  unable to duplicate your issue by pressing tab. Please add gif video how to replicate issue.\nAlso, I don't know why you use tab. Undo is Ctrl-z and Redo is Ctrl-Shift-z.. @hever \nWhat browser and OS you use?. @hever \nThanks for anim gif ! Now I figured out how to duplicate this. This seems strange why it does this.. Please fix your root-url to be correct http://10.1.96.116/wekan/ or http://10.1.96.116/wekan , whichever works. This moved to #1703 \nDelete board moved to #833. @NoodleBB Can you look at this?. Your way of install does not autoupdate like snap, and does not have sandboxing like snap. Manual installs are only supported for developing new features, they are not for production in any way.. Running in screen does not start after server reboot.. Main wekan source install and build script is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/rebuild-wekan.sh\nIf you have any improvements to it, you can add pull request.. Hmm, your instructions actually have some meteor bundle info that is not yet in wiki. Please edit Wekan GitHub wiki directly and add info to there.. Systems that don't have automated upgrades get hacked very soon.\nWekan has Hall of Fame for those that have reported security issues:\nhttps://wekan.github.io/hall-of-fame/\nFor example when Drupal security fix was released, soon most Drupal websites that did not patch, were compromised.\nSandboxing like Snap, Docker, and Sandstorm Grains prevent compromise of Wekan compromising your whole server.\nWekan has very frequent updates to fix various bugs and add new features. For example, one day I did make 7 releases of Wekan.\nIf you have other ways to sandbox all your software separately, like using chroot jails, or similar, and have automated your infra backup and restore to point-in-time, maybe in that case using just source installs would work. I just like to have sandboxing safety net. Those servers that don't support running snap or docker usually don't have latest kernels with latest protections.. I think there was deb package sometime for Wekan, somewhere in wiki or some repo listed at https://github.com/wekan\nThat rebuild script:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/rebuild-wekan.sh\ncould have some improvements, like option for other ways to install, upgrade, etc.\nThere most likely is a lot to improve source, bundle etc installs. There are also some ansible scripts for installing at https://github.com/wekan . It would be very nice if those could be integrated to same script.\nI do also understand the viewpoint of not doing automatic updates. Sometimes something breaks, and I fix it in next release, so Wekan works again.. @Tampa \nThanks for your gratitude, all encouragement from Wekan community keeps me going !\nThanks also for your script above! I will look at it later what to add to wiki etc.\nYes, in internal networks that is a good strategy.. Do you use Node v8.12 ? It has performance fixes.\nnode -v\nDoes your server have SSD disk? NVME would be even better.\nHow much RAM your server has? Check that server is not swapping:\nfree -m\nrebuild-wekan.sh script is what I currently use for installing dependencies.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/tree/master/releases\nDo you use newest MongoDB 3.2.21 ? Another alternative is RocksDB, if you get it working.\nIf server has many users, you can improve performance by running multiple node.js servers in different localhost ports behind nginx round robin proxy, because one node uses only one cpu at a time.\nIt's also possible that some indexes are missing from wekan mongodb schema. If you log all mongodb queries and find slow queries, you can add index.\nIf you have time to debug with kadira, or look how similar Meteor app Rocket.Chat is scaled, more info is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Debugging. Card have \"hamburger\" menu with options \"Move to Top\" and \"Move to Bottom\".. Moved to #2098. The bug is at CollectionFS, as can be seen at #386 .\nAvatar URL currently needs to include subpath of ROOT_URL to display correctly, like /wekan/cfs. My javascript on the fly fix was too fragile, it did not always work. There are couple of different ways to fix this.\na) Workaround way: In wekan/server/migrations.js, check does process.env.ROOT_URL contain suburl like /wekan. If yes, search MongoDB users.profile.avatarUrl for those that do not begin with /wekan/cfs/ and change them to have that.\nb) As part of #142 supporting other ways to store attachments, make all attachments to use any of those ways to store attachments with correct URLs.. @adyachok \nCan you look at this?. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1816. @tdemaret \nAre you sure about this in docker-compose.yml ?\nports:\n  - 8080:80\nI think the format is:\n<public_port>:<private_port>\nSo if you are exposing outside port 8080 to inside port 8080 of wekan-app container, it should be:\n8080:8080\nIf you expose it to port 80 to outside, it shoud be:\n80:8080\n Which way is it?\n. @Asgoret \nNow.\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan\nImage rebuilds automatically after every change. You can also see those in webbrowser at https://quay.io/wekan/wekan. Boards already have color, in board hamburger menu.\nCard color moved to #428. @jnso \nCan you add recorded anim gif about how your fix works? So I understand what to test?. sorry, there already is anim gif at that issue :D nevermind, I will look at there. @tigger10 \nI think you mean Example 3:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings\nAlso see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. snap\n```bash\nsudo snap set wekan root-url='http://123.456.123.456/boards'\nsudo snap set port='8080'\napache wekan.conf:ApacheConf\n\n        ServerName 123.456.123.456\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com\n    DocumentRoot /var/www-vhosts/example.com\n    <Directory />\n            Options FollowSymLinks\n            AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Indexes Options=MultiViews\n    </Directory>\n\n    <Directory /var/www-vhosts/example.com>\n            Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews\n            AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Indexes Options=MultiViews\n            Require all granted\n    </Directory>\n\n    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/example.com-error.log\n\n    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n    # alert, emerg.\n    LogLevel warn\n\n    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/example.com-access.log combined\n    ServerSignature Off\n    ProxyPassMatch   \"^/(sockjs\\/.*\\/websocket)$\" \"ws://127.0.0.1:8080/$1\"\n    ProxyPass        \"/\" \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/\"\n    ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/\"\n\n\n```\nNote: if not already done, don't forget to enable your vhost sudo a2ensite wekan.conf\nReload Apache sudo service apache2 reload\nThen browse http://123.456.123.456/boards. That documentroot shoud point to your wekan/public directory.\nUsually on Ubuntu file locations are at:\n/etc/apache2/sites-available/wekan.conf\nAnd there needs to be a symlink to it:\nsudo su\ncd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled\nln -s ../sites-available/wekan.conf wekan.conf\nAnd then reload apache\nsudo systemctl reload apache2\nYou also need to check that wekan and mongodb is running:\nsudo snap services\nIf they are not running, you need to reboot your server, if you have not rebooted after installing snap:\nsudo reboot\nAnd then check again:\nsudo snap services\nIf those are not still running, reinstall wekan:\n```\nsudo snap remove wekan\nsudo snap install wekan\n```\nAnd set wekan root-url etc settings.. @tigger10 \nI think you don't need documentroot at all.\n```ApacheConf\n\n        ServerName 123.456.123.456\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com\n        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/example.com-error.log\n    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n    # alert, emerg.\n    LogLevel warn\n\n    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/example.com-access.log combined\n    ServerSignature Off\n    ProxyPassMatch   \"^/(sockjs\\/.*\\/websocket)$\" \"ws://127.0.0.1:8080/$1\"\n    ProxyPass        \"/\" \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/\"\n    ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/\"\n\n\n```. @tigger10 \nYou could use my Commercial Support https://wekan.team and contact me by email.\nIt seems that I can't figure out exact reason without ssh access to server.. What version of Ubuntu? Do you have latest updates installed?\nOn my Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian 9 servers it does not require reboot.\nReboot is only required after first time after installing installind snap command.\nFor Ubuntu updates, I have unattended-upgrades also installed and configured, so it reboots at night if there is kernel updates.\nOn some server I use integrated Caddy, and on other server Nginx in front of Wekan.\nWhat does this command output on your server?\nsudo snap services\nIf you have these enabled:\nsudo snap enable wekan\nyou could also make sure that systemd keeps them running:\n```\nsudo systemctl enable snap.wekan.wekan\nsudo systemctl enable snap.wekan.mongodb\n```\nAnother way to \"fix\" it would be to setup your server root cronjob to reboot at night.. You could backup wekan and upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04, I I think it has newer snap.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Backup-and-restore. No reply received. For me snap works.. Archives have been renamed to Recycle Bin #1429 , because it's more familiar to users than archives.\nClick card / hamburger menu / Move card to Recycle Bin.\nAlso lists and swimlanes can be moved to Recycle Bin.\nThere is Board / hamburger menu / Recycle Bin, where you see what is at Recycle Bin, and can restore.\nThere will be later Empty Recycle Bin #1625\nOn All Boards page, there is also Recycle Bin for Boards. Currently there is bug about Delete board from Recycle Bin #833 , it will be fixed later.. You configure SMTP settings in environment variables MAIL_URL and MAIL_FROM.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/start-wekan.sh#L10-L13\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L109-L116\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nAdmin Panel is mostly for user management. In general, all settings will be made configurable with environment variables, to make automated installs easier.\n. @TNick \nCan you add pull request that:\n- restores SMTP settings in Admin Panel\n- does not show STMP password visible in admin panel, so it would work like people admin. I try to be less evil.. Yes, that FAQ entry was added today, because I received the question about evilness of Wekan today.. @GuiGuiSoft \nIf you are in a hurry, you can use Caddy / Nginx / Apache config to show some empty webpage in API URL.. afaik @Akuket is currently looking into adding ability to disable API. There is now ability to disable api using WITH_API=false.\nDisabling API does disable also exporting Wekan board, because that does use API.\nSnap:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nDocker:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L121-L125\nSource:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/virtualbox/start-wekan.sh#L17-L18\n. Moved to #1160. Moved to #1167. Moved to #1160. @a5dev \nYes there is notifications, when you click on board Muted / Tracking / Watching. It could probably even work, if you test it, and have email configured correctly, but only for the user that enables it for his/herself. It most likely is not the exact use case you are asking for, for that there will be IFTTT at #1160 . @GYKADSC \nI presume this is on AWS. \n1) Create snapshot of EC2 instance\n2) Attach snapshotted EBS volume to other EC2 instance\n3) Copy raw MongoDB files of Wekan to new server\n4) When MongoDB is not running on new server, replace MongoDB raw database files with those you copied from old server\n5) Start Wekan\n6) If export does not work, try to upgrade to newest Wekan, and try export again.\nIf you need any help with this, you can use my Commercial Support https://wekan.team. Install snap and caddy to get https. Please see this for using different protocols for email:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail\nAnd this for setting Wekan ROOT_URL for http or https, according to final URL:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings. @gabrielcossette \nScreenshot please.

I'm not so familiar with Apache.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. Also if anyone else has Wekan working Apache, please fix wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Apache\nAnd write some tips to this issue too.. Please set root-url correctly. Moved to #1670. Yes, only en.i18n.json is done in pull requests with new features. All other translations are done only at Transifex.. @haimter \nDid you set root-url correctly to real url, like http or https ?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings. It seems that when card has image attachment, opening card details on mobile view shows blank.. @9a3eedi \nWhat is your Wekan snap version?\nsudo snap list. @9a3eedi \nAre you sure you are logging in at right url http://192.168.0.51/sign-in ?. @harrypuru \nYour sudo snap list shows that you don't have wekan snap installed.. @harrypuru \nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. @harrypuru \n1) At url /sign-in, click Register, at bottom of that page, Register URL is /sign-up . First registered user will be admin. You can use any username, email address and password.\n2) After registering, ignore error about email settings.\n3) Login with your new account at /sign-in\n. @scoubidoo \nPlease add recorded anim gif about what is the problem. Thanks!. No reply received. I did not understand what is the problem.. @hever \nDoes import work if you bind both users to the one on second server?. @hever \nI think it's necessary to bind all users that are imported. If second server only has one user, then all imported users need to be paired to that only one user on second server. Can you try does it work?\nMaybe there should be some warning message if some user is not paired yet, or if someone has idea how this would be made better.. @hever \nYes, usually you need to create users on second server so you can pair users to second server users correctly.\nI will add more info to import page.. @DKelur \nUse markdown:\n[Wekan website](https://wekan.github.io)\nMore markdown examples at https://wekan.github.io. @crispybrain \nPlease try to download again. I fixed file permission issue.\nPlease add comment to this issue, does download work now.. Wekan website had download button, on that platforms page is info how to build from source. You don't seem to have correct node.js version, or there is some other issue when you built from source. AFAIK snap and docker versions do work.. @xiboulay \nDid you click export with left mouse button? So it would then prompt to download .json file?\nBecause I think you did right click and saved Wekan webpage.. @xiboulay \nDid you build from wekan devel branch? What commit?. @xiboulay \nOk it seems that export is broken. I'll look at it.. @xiboulay \nOk reason is that there is new feature that makes it possible to disable Wekan API, and sets it disabled as default: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/6173a7338135c87321be909482ff356d32977de6\nDisabling API seems to disable export too.\nYou can enable API with environment variable: WITH_API=true\nSo in your start-wekan.sh:\nexport WITH_API='true'\nnode main.js\n. Hi,\nWekan already has this feature.\nFor example with this markdown:\n[Wekan website](https://wekan.github.io) - [Wekan Docs](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki) - [Link to card](https://boards.wekan.team/b/CrHwevz8gFi6vENRZ/test/i8hkEHtceY6riZ2ub)\nThen you see links in your card this way, for example:\nWekan website - Wekan Docs - Link to card\nYou can find card link here, at card hamburger menu / more / Copy Card Link to Clipboard:\n\nYou can see more markdown formatting feature examples at screenshot at top of website https://wekan.github.io\n. Yes, root-url needs to be https. It works for me with Caddy, without reload.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L117-L122. @xadagaras \nWhat is content of your docker-compose.yml ?. @xadagaras \nDid you backup and cleanup Docker? https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/985\nSnap works for me. Snap also has automatic updates.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install. I did test with latest docker-compose.yml , it works for me.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nOnly things I changed were:\n1) docker-compose.yml\n```\nPort: external port 3030 maps to internal port 8080 inside Docker container\nports:\n- 3030:8080\nWekan web address, Caddy provides SSL\n\nROOT_URL=https://example.com\n```\n\n2) Caddyfile, Caddy webserver is in front of Wekan, proxying to docker port 3030\nexample.com {\n        proxy / localhost:3030 {\n          websocket\n          transparent\n        }\n}. Hmm, actually, I need to make some fixes, just a moment.. It seems that this is not fixed yet on Docker.. @hwcltjn \nYou can look does this package included in Wekan have some options for logging:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/eluck/accounts-lockout. @hwcltjn \nMaybe that is for fast repeated attempts in very short amount of time? That package has some test in github repo file. I have not tested yet how it works.. @max-marschall \nIt's Sandstorm feature.\nPull requests for Wekan welcome.. @JonasDralle \nIn screenshot above the reason why user is not created is that if there is Admin Panel setting \"Invite only\" then new users can only be invited at Admin Panel by admin. To have users invite at board there is feature request #2060 \nAnyway, Restrict registration to specific E-Mail domain feature is not at Wekan yet.. @JonasDralle \nIn screenshot above the reason why user is not created is that if there is Admin Panel setting \"Invite only\" then new users can only be invited at Admin Panel by admin. To have users invite at board there is feature request #2060 \nAnyway, Restrict registration to specific E-Mail domain feature is not at Wekan yet.. @JonasDralle \nWhoa how you register with RegEx?\nI presume you mean REST API.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API. @xadagaras \nPlease change docker-compose.yml to:\nports:\n- 25001:8080\n. I would recommend getting newest docker-compose.yml file from:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\nand adding your settings to there. Newest settings will always be in that file.. Docker Hub image sometimes is broken. quay Docker image usually works better.\nNewest Wekan is currently v1.26.\nThere is currently bug in Docker #1820 .\nSnap does not have that bug.. @xadagaras \nSnap upgrades automatically, and keeps settings on automatic upgrades:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nFor Docker, I have not looked does DockerBunker have keeping settings feature yet,\nyou could look at it:\nhttps://github.com/chaosbunker/dockerbunker\nIf there is no such feature, you could add feature request to new DockerBunker issue.\nOn Linux and Mac bash shell, you see differences of docker-compose.yml this way:\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb\ncd wekan-mongodb\ndiff docker-compose.yml /home/user/production/docker-compose.yml | less\nIf you have already cloned repo, you can check updates with:\ncd wekan-mongodb\ngit pull\ndiff docker-compose.yml /home/user/production/docker-compose.yml | less\n. @xadagaras \nAll Wekan changes are announced at ChangeLog:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md\nThat port 8080 change is here at v1.24:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v124-2018-08-09-wekan-release.

This has old release tags etc. Thanks!. @therampagerado \nOn those boards that do open, when you on browser right click / Inspect / Console, please copy those javascript errors as comment to this issue.\nDisabling auto updates is not recommended, because then you do not get bugfixes, security fixes, new features etc. Please help debug this, so I can fix this.. @gerroon \nThanks! I added those settings to wiki:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Apache. Moved to #1404. Screenshot please.. or mockup. Moved to #812. You need to urlencode password.\nSave this code to harddisk, open with webbrowser, and click button to urlencode:\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_encodeuri\nI added emphasis to page Troubleshooting Email. @nguyentrongbang \nThanks, I'll update wiki.. Wekan works this way, because Wekan allows multiline checklist items, markdown etc. I think these features are not in Trello. Wekan and Trello are completely different, Trello is not Open Source.\nIn this case, it depends what would be logical and user-friendly way to paste many checklist items, without losing Wekan multi-line functionality. Should where be some checkbox that would indicate to Wekan that pasted content is in certain format, so Wekan would convert pasted content to multiple checklist items. Pasting multiple checklist items should still allow pasting multiline checklist items.\nI have also looked a little about adding wysiwyg editor to card details, maybe with different views for markdown and wysiwyg editors in different tabs. Then it would be possible to copy that edited markdown format content to somewhere else where Wekan accepts markdown, like checklist items.\nThis all still needs thinking what would be most user friendly way to do these.. Wekan only works with MongoDB 3.2. There is attachment upload crash bug on MongoDB 3.4.. Moved to #1625. I did add SMTP settings back to Admin Panel, because @TNick asked it at #1790 .\n@TNick are you interested in fixing this?\nThere are also many other settings that are set using snap commands, and do not exist in Admin Panel:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nI don't know yet when I do have enough time to add those to Admin Panel.. @bgmnt \nYou can use Custom Fields. I added documentation to wiki:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Custom-Fields\nWould this work for you well enough?. @therampagerado \nIt is possible to speed up Wekan board by:\n- Deleting activities from Wekan database using Robo 3T\n- Using cleanup script\nBut those are not integrated to Wekan Web UI yet.\n@KuenzelIT \nNo, I think dragging would not be right way, and implementing it would probably be complicated.\nThe right way is to use IFTTT #1160 to move done cards automatically, when IFTTT feature is done.\n. Moved to #1996. https://wekan.indie.host/sign-in  works now.\n. @WilmarCopeteMarin \nPlease wait when that URL starts working again. I asked them to upgrade to newer Wekan version, that has new speedups.. @rhelsing \nIn your Comment only permissions PR https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/925 what does this mean?\nmodels/lists.js:\nreturn allowIsBoardMemberNonComment(userId, Boards.findOne(doc.boardId));\n\nWhat does it do?\nDid you name it correctly? Or, should is be renamed to something more descriptive?\nDo you already have permissions for No comments somehow? So for that users comments are not shown?\n\nSome related PRs here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pulls?q=is%3Apr+permission+is%3Aclosed. Yes, CommentOnly would be much more descriptive, because current NonComment can be easily confused when I add NoComments. I will look how to make the change.. Currently at Wekan code, problem is not to do the least intrusive change. More important is to make code clearer and have consistent naming. For example, there is still references to archives in code and database, it should be renamed to recycle bin like it's at translations already.. Thanks a lot! I will add this to Wekan.. @InfoSec812 \nDo you know what should be changed in OpenShift template?\nCan you add pull request?. @InfoSec812 \nCan you submit PR to https://github.com/wekan/wekan devel branch?. @InfoSec812 \nThanks! Are you adding more commits, or is it ready now?. Fixed at 652f4e693bfff78c740faeb32df83152a60f2158. @rjevnikar \nI added my current plans to #2218 but I did not get it working yet, help would be very welcome.. Done, newest tar.gz for Wekan v1.41 is available:\nhttps://releases.wekan.team. I had some time, so I added 1.58 tarball.\nPlease add comment again when you need new tarball, sometimes I forget or don't have enough time.. Moved to #1672. @jcdwekan \nWhat action you did on MongoDB to make it reload?. @feuerball11 \nCan you look at this?. @salleman33 \nCan you look at this?. @salleman33 \nOn my Wekan install, there is multiple existing users, but anyone logging in with oauth logs in as me, first admin user.. @bnalpay \nWekan user verifying is broken #1426 , users are not verified.. @salleman33 \nIt seems to try to find only those that have verified true.

I added these console.log lines:\n```\ndiff --git a/models/users.js b/models/users.js\nindex 01673e4..4652395 100644\n--- a/models/users.js\n+++ b/models/users.js\n@@ -490,7 +490,9 @@ if (Meteor.isServer) {\n if (user.services.oidc) {\n   const email = user.services.oidc.email.toLowerCase();\n\n-\n+      console.log(\"Email: \" + user.services.oidc.email);\n+      console.log(\"Username: \" + user.services.oidc.username);\n+      console.log(\"Fullname: \" + user.services.oidc.fullname);\n       user.username = user.services.oidc.username;\n       user.emails = [{ address: email, verified: true }];\n       const initials = user.services.oidc.fullname.match(/\\b[a-zA-Z]/g).join('').toUpperCase();\n```\nI don't even know where you check and validate info that is coming from oidc. There seems to be some code on create user, but I probably would need to go through oidc documentation to figure it out.. @HLFH \nYes sure. But first the feature needs to be fixed so that it works.. @salleman33 \nYes, send me email to x@xet7.org. @rjevnikar \nI will add sometime in near future check to code, that if OAuth2 is not configured, Oidc button is not shown.. @HLFH @rjevnikar \nWekan v1.49 has now been released, it has IFTTT and OAuth2 removed. Their development continues at wekan repo edge branch, until they work.\nThis is how to use snap stable channel, that most Wekan users have installed:\nsudo snap refresh wekan --stable --amend\nThis is how to use snap edge channel:\nsudo snap refresh wekan --edge --amend. @salleman33 \nWhat personal identity provider you used for oidc?\nIs it open source?. Thanks ! I will test.. @salleman33 \nDoes this work well for you with doorkeeper?\nDoes my change oidc username to preferred_username fix or break something?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/734e4e5f3ff2c3dabf94c0fbfca561db066c4565. Moved to here from #1977 \nSetting OAUTH2_ENABLED=false does not work.\n@hever \nYes, every open issue usually still exists. I usually close those issues that are fixed.\nI have also link at OAuth2 wiki page to this bug here.\nI have not yet figured out how to fix this. PRs welcome.. @horvan \nThose NextCloud changes have not been added to Wekan yet.. @horvan \nOAuth2 above uses OIDC package, that is compatible with doorkeeper. Using similar code it's possible to add also rocketchat package, that is listed here:\nhttps://guide.meteor.com/accounts.html#accounts-ui\nI have previously tried adding rocketchat package, it adds login button with text RocketChat.\nBy looking at comments above, and searching closed pull request, anyone can see related code.\nEven beginners can get features done for Wekan, as can be seen here:\nhttps://blog.wekan.team/2018/05/wekan-v1-00-released/index.html\nFirst step is to read the code, and ask questions.\nCan you look at adding this?. @horvan \nOk. Thanks for info!. Some related discussion from Vanila Chat.\nFrom richard:\n\nI am busy with an integration of Wekan into our custom web app (vue.js based) and would like to display Wekan in our frontend. We could easily do this via iframe etc. What we need to do is make it as seemless as possible, so when a user is logged into our side (we use an openID implementation) they are automatically logged into Wekan / account created if not existing already. Am I correct in assuming we can pass through a JWT to Wekan, which can then query the token check endpoint on ourside to validate the token and receive the user details? How complex would it be to add an integration like this?\n\nxet7 is currently doing something similar for Auth0 without JWT. Some parameters maybe need to be added to wekan/server/authentication.js and there is some cookie checking code at login page javascript and some API to create user token from email address. Not all code is there yet, but point is to get user automatically logged when user comes to Wekan login page, if user has been already logged in to other app like yours, or Nextcloud/RocketChat/Friend/Keycloak etc. Something similar exists already for Sandstorm, where Wekan is on iframe and Sandstorm has SSO that logins to all apps at once.\nThere are 2 ways to do this:\na) Use OIDC package from @salleman33 and add Nextcloud etc to it\nb) Use other meteor accounts packages from atmospherejs and/or rocketchat to have RocketChat and other logins. Each login package works a little differently, so it's mainly about using correct package.\nFor iframe, there is Custom CSS input boxes at Wekan Admin Panel/Layout, but those don't work yet. Plan is to embed iframe menus with HTML/CSS and have wekan root-url='https://example.com/boards' so that link to card would work correctly and not require redirects. There are also whitelabeling options at Admin Panel/Layout/Hide Logo and Custom Product Name, although that logo still flashes briefly at login screen.\n@gil0109\nYes user logging in as first admin Wekan user is know issue in current OIDC/OAuth2 package that works correctly only with doorkeeper OAuth2 provider. Most likely it does not use correct username parameter, or there is some other wrong setting.\nTo fix this, correct username parameter should be found, by testing with doorkeeper.\nIf that does not work, then some other auth package should be added to Wekan, and used instead of OIDC package. Currently Wekan auth works with password and LDAP logins, so maybe some of it's code could be looked as example by searching from Wekan GitHub closed pull requests, or from Wekan's current code by using script wekan/find.sh for example like this ./find.sh LDAP.. @gil0109 \nYou can add Keycloak wiki page to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Keycloak and add link to wiki menu near OAuth2. Wiki is community maintained, you can edit it directly. Thanks!. @gil0109 \nYes. When creating user, you need to add code to add boardView item.. I would presume that with OIDC Keycloak working settings, similar would work also for OIDC Azure if username etc is mapped correctly, @danpatdav could check about this. The remaining would be to add to @salleman33 OIDC code or Wekan code that boardView item would be created too.\nPlease test etc.. @gil0109 \nI don't know yet who has time to look at adding boardView item when new user logins to Wekan using OIDC. While it would be nice for someone to try to make PR, I could also try it a little later. I don't have Keycloak or Azure setup yet, so it will take more time for me to get up to speed.. Wekan code is at https://github.com/wekan/wekan\nThere is rebuild-wekan.sh that 1 installs dependencies 2 builds wekan.\nThere is also start-wekan.sh that starts Wekan with cd wekan/.build/bundle && node main.js\nAlthough in that case installing MongoDB 3.2.11 is also required.\nOther option is to cd wekan && WITH_API=true meteor --port 4000 so it rebuilds wekan while running, and also starts mongodb that is included with meteor.\nThose scripts should mostly work on Ubuntu 14.04, Debian 9, Ubuntu on Linux Subsystem for Windows, and Mac - some related Mac info is at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Mac .\nWekan auth code is at wekan/server/authentication.js and some working LDAP login code is at\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap/blob/master/server/loginHandler.js\nSome developer docs are at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Developer-Documentation\nThere is wekan/find.sh that you can use for example to find boardView code this way:\ncd wekan\n./find.sh boardView. I think this is that profile error, because I got it too - maybe because of some wrong settings.\n{\"line\":\"431\",\"file\":\"oauth.js\",\"message\":\"Error in OAuth Server: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'profile' in null\",\"time\":{\"$date\":1549158981384},\"level\":\"warn\"}\nException while invoking method 'login' TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'profile' in null\n    at packages/underscore.js:894:15\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\n    at _.each._.forEach (packages/underscore.js:139:11)\n    at Function._.pick (packages/underscore.js:893:5)\n    at Object.handleOauthRequest (packages/salleman_oidc.js:48:20)\n    at OAuth._requestHandlers.(anonymous function) (packages/oauth2.js:27:31)\n    at middleware (packages/oauth.js:203:5)\n    at packages/oauth.js:176:5. So there is this code in salleman_oidc.js, that 48:20 is word pick at 3rd line \nif (accessToken) {\n    var tokenContent = getTokenContent(accessToken);\n    var fields = _.pick(tokenContent, getConfiguration().idTokenWhitelistFields);\n    _.extend(serviceData, fields);\n  }. packages/oauth.js:176:5 is word middleware below:\n// Listen to incoming OAuth http requests\nWebApp.connectHandlers.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  // Need to create a Fiber since we're using synchronous http calls and nothing\n  // else is wrapping this in a fiber automatically\n  Fiber(function () {\n    middleware(req, res, next);\n  }).run();\n});\npackages/oauth2.js:27:31 is handleOauthRequest below:\n// Run service-specific handler.\n    var oauthResult = service.handleOauthRequest(query);\n    var credentialSecret = Random.secret();. @gil0109 \nI will make new release with that fix today.. @gil0109\nWekan v2.17 is now released for all Wekan platforms. For Snap, if it's not yet updated, you can do\nsudo snap refresh. @brevilo \nNo.. @brevilo \nProbably https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2153 includes disabling OAuth2, but that remains to be seen after @Akuket has fixed lint error so that I can test it.\nAnyway, I will close this issue after disabling OAuth2 is possible.. @danpatdav \nYes sure. I'm also thinking that those parameters to salleman_oidc.js could be set as environment variables.. This can not be closed yet.\n\n[ ] I'm currently debugging Auth0 OIDC login parameters, it does not work yet.\n[ ]  I would like to also map OIDC picture/avatar, or download it to Wekan.\n[ ]  OIDC can not be disabled yet.\n[X]  I would like to be able to set requestpermissions with env variable like openid profile email\n[ ]  I would like to have working Auth0/Nextcloud/RocketChat mapping examples at wiki and docker-compose.yml\n[ ]  I would like to be able to set default auth method at Admin Panel to Password/LDAP/OIDC/CAS.. @danpatdav\n\nAdmin creation logic would go to wekan/server/authentication.js where Wekan would check is env variables set and create admin user..

MongoDB server can be inside or outside of Docker container, or use MongoDB authentication in URL. This moves everything. See Wekan GitHub wiki for more info.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup. @qknight \nThanks for info! I sent email to server admin asking for fixing that.. Fixed.. If you use Snap, what does this command show after you see Error 400 ?\nsudo snap logs wekan.wekan\nIf you use Docker, what does this command show after you see Error 400 ?\nsudo docker logs wekan-app. @sfahrenholz \nI think you are using Wekan edge tag, because you have Wekan version 1.49.1. It has buggy new features like IFTTT #1898 and OAuth2. It would be better if you use some release tag like v1.49 or latest tag.\nAnyway, that bug exists in all versions of Wekan. You can fix it manually by opening exported Wekan JSON file in text editor, and replacing:\n\"isCommentOnly\":false}\nwith\n\"isCommentOnly\":false,\"isNoComments\":false}\nand then importing that Wekan JSON to Wekan.\nThis bug is because recently I added new feature member role \"No Comments\" #1861 . I have not fixed this yet.. @rjevnikar \nDo you have time to fix Wekan JSON export issue I described in comment above?. Thanks, I have seen also that, but forgot to mention. If all members are mapped, usually when that happens, board is imported anyway.. Do you have both Rocket.Chat and Wekan installed on same server? Because it seems node does not start, there is EADDRINUSE error of something already running at same port\nUsually Rocket.Chat is at port 3000 and Wekan at port 3001, like this:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/OAuth2#2-install-wekan. @Broxxx3 \nThanks, I noticed this too on my server, it looks like my data is gone.\nCan you see is there any old data somewhere below /var/snap/wekan ?\nI don't know how apparmor would cause this.\nMaybe this is why Wekan demo did not work #1902 , so I asked can that server admin restore data.. I will ask snap devs do they have any idea.. It seems that someone is hacking Wekan and emptying databases of servers around the Internet.\nI found this from another server, in mongodb database:\n\nBitCoin#...eMail mongo_bak@protonmail.com Exchange https://localbitcoins.com/ Solution: Your Database is downloaded and backed up on our secured servers. To recover your lost data: Send 0.6 BTC to our BitCoin Address and Contact us by eMail with your server IP Address and a Proof of Payment. Any eMail without your server IP Address and a Proof of Payment together will be ignored. We will drop the backup after 24 hours. You are welcome!\n\nSo please make backups.\nAs always, I think Wekan on Sandstorm is not affected.. I found the same BitCoin message from 3rd server.. @therampagerado \nWekan has public hall of fame, where current Wekan security issues are reported. Following are only my guesses.\nOne option is that someone is brute forcing Wekan API or login. Wekan has https://atmospherejs.com/eluck/accounts-lockout package for brute force protection, but I have not tested does it work. There is https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1572 for adding additional config options.\nWekan has setting for disabling API https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys , using WITH_API=false\nBut it seems that somehow they are able to empty whole MongoDB database so that there is only these in MongoDB /var/snap/wekan/common:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  513 21.9. 19:49 Readme.bson\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   86 21.9. 19:49 Readme.metadata.json\nAnd that Readme.bson contains that message above.\nAnother possibility is that too much Wekan MongoDB data is published to client, and using that it's possible to delete data from backend.. Actually, files above are from mongodump, in directory dump/Warning.\nThere Mongo format data at /var/snap/wekan/common. Here is how to do backups:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup\nBackups should be stored outside of server.\nAll Wekan data is at MongoDB.\nYou can see snap settings with:\nsudo snap get wekan\nYou can copy those settings to textfile.. @sorgoz \nDo you mean mongodb authentication like in MongoDB URL? Setting like this?\nMONGO_URL=mongodb://wekan:somepassword@127.0.0.1:27019/wekan\nThere has never been MongoDB password in Wekan Snap.. It is already possible to disable Wekan MongoDB:\nsudo snap stop wekan.mongodb\nsudo systemctl disable snap.wekan.mongodb\nAnd then use some other MongoDB with MongoDB URL, maybe like this:\nsudo snap set wekan mongo-url='mongodb://wekan:somepassword@127.0.0.1:27019/wekan'\nI have not tested it yet. Related mongo url issue at #1375. For Wekan users, there is no default password. First registered user will be admin.\nAdding users works currently like this:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Adding-users. @Broxxx3 \nLooks like they seem to be able to start MongoDB shell from clientside, using MongoDB that is included with Wekan.. No, actually that is MongoDB client 3.6.3 . Wekan uses MongoDB 3.2.x.. Another way to protect Wekan is to add proxybouncer in front of Wekan:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Let's-Encrypt-and-Google-Auth#b-caddy-lets-encrypt--google-auth-only-allowed-email-addresses--wekan. This just makes me feel that Wekan should be used only at Sandstorm, and that I should fix Sandstorm related bugs.. Wekan at Snap/Docker/Sandstorm is inside secure sandbox, and can not access files outside of Wekan directory, so mostly harm is deleting Wekan MongoDB database content.. But another issue is, instead of drop, some MongoDB command also can change passwords, etc modify database.. Or alternatively, create new username/email address/password with admin privileges.. Hmm, that should be the default setting.. @Broxxx3 \nNot yet https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/11\nSure it's possible with firewall like UFW like this:\nsudo apt install ufw\nsudo ufw allow http\nsudo ufw allow https\nsudo ufw allow ssh\nsudo ufw enable\nbut I should add snap setting for node.. This could be related:\nhttps://forums.meteor.com/t/fyi-mongodb-hack/33039/11. I'm currently building new Wekan Snap v1.50 that includes default MongoDB bind IP address 127.0.0.1. Wekan Snap v1.50 is now pushed to Snap stable channel as automatic update. It installs maybe automatically soon, or if you have set update schedule, then at that schedule time, for example at night.\nI have not tested does default setting have effect on existing installs.. @therampagerado \nOn local network Wekan can not be hacked. It is not accessible publicly.\nThere is some script that goes through public servers that has ports opened to Internet.. Today again that same hack script did empty my database.\nIf I remember correctly, I restored database backup yesterday.\nOn my server MongoDB ports 27017 and 20179 seem to be closed, as most other ports too.\nOn server I use Wekan v1.50 that has MongoDB bind IP to 127.0.0.1.. @Broxxx3 \nOriginally today I had too much running:\nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:2049            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -                   \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:39205           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      3179/rpc.mountd     \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:27017         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      9045/mongod         \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:27019         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      8797/mongod         \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5900          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      6668/qemu-system-x8 \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:43373           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      3179/rpc.mountd     \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:111             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1691/rpcbind        \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:179             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      3195/bird           \ntcp        0      0 192.168.122.1:53        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4690/dnsmasq        \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.53:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1714/systemd-resolv \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      3194/sshd           \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:40119           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -                   \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      9328/node           \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3001            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      12486/node          \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:57533           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      3179/rpc.mountd     \ntcp6       0      0 :::2049                 :::*                    LISTEN      -                   \ntcp6       0      0 :::56965                :::*                    LISTEN      3179/rpc.mountd     \ntcp6       0      0 :::50217                :::*                    LISTEN      3179/rpc.mountd     \ntcp6       0      0 :::50285                :::*                    LISTEN      3179/rpc.mountd     \ntcp6       0      0 :::111                  :::*                    LISTEN      1691/rpcbind        \ntcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      8521/caddy          \ntcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      3194/sshd           \ntcp6       0      0 :::35927                :::*                    LISTEN      -                   \ntcp6       0      0 :::443                  :::*                    LISTEN      8521/caddy\nI removed extra stuff, so now I only have these:\nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:27017         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      9045/mongod         \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:27019         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      8797/mongod         \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5900          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      6668/qemu-system-x8 \ntcp        0      0 192.168.122.1:53        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4690/dnsmasq        \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.53:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1714/systemd-resolv \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      3194/sshd           \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      9328/node           \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3001            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      12486/node          \ntcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      8521/caddy          \ntcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      3194/sshd           \ntcp6       0      0 :::443                  :::*                    LISTEN      8521/caddy\nI need to check does KVM/QEMU with virt-manager still work after removing those extra.\nI'll look at mongodb.log next..

When I search for error, list is longer.\nerror.txt\n. I do have only public key authentication on ssh.\nNo password authentication enabled.. I did:\n1) Drop those Mongo databases\n2) Create new Wekan account\n3) Disable self-registration\n4) Enable domain to have CloudFlare in front of it. I already had DNS at CloudFlare.\nI will look what WAF options are at CloudFlare etc.. It looks like this could be it:\nhttps://kromtech.com/blog/security-center/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-mongodb-to-be-compromised. I think the only problem was that MongoDB port was exposed to Internet. I have not had Wekan database emptied after binding MongoDB to 127.0.0.1.\nAll those other socket connections are what happen also when Wekan is accessible from Internet. They are just Wekan code counting cards etc code that is not well optimized.\nMeteor.js framework does a lot of magic behind the scenes, and with the countless features and bugs of Wekan it's no wonder Wekan seems slow sometimes. When those get fixed Wekan will work much faster. Basically logging all Wekan MongoDB queries and adding indexes would help a lot already.\nBut if someone still gets Wekan MongoDB emptied with newest Wekan Snap, I would like to know about it.. If MongoDB bind ip or unix socket:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nBut those more likely are websocket connections, those show Node.js v8.12.0 that Wekan uses.\nMongoDB core 2.0.11 is here, release 7 days ago:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-core/v/2.0.11\nAnd issues are here:\nhttps://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-core/issues. @sfahrenholz Thanks for testing edge version!\n@Angtrim can look at this.\nMore info about Wekan Snap stable and edge versions here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Snap-Developer-Docs. IFTTT already mostly works on edge:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Snap-Developer-Docs\nSome small issues still to fix, as seen from comments above.\nRelated #1160. @therampagerado \nNo, this is not production ready.\n\nThose above mentioned small issues are not fixed yet.\nI have not yet fixed lint warnings.\nThere is no documentation about this in Wekan GitHub wiki yet. If anyone has time to try every possible feature of IFTTT and add documentation to wiki and English screenshots as attachments to this issue in .zip file, it would speed up getting IFTTT production ready.\nI have not had time to even try does every feature of this works. I would need a list about what features IFTTT currently has, and does something not work, as comment to this issue.. Someone could add docs to this wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/IFTTT. There can also be animgifs in that documentation, that would be even better. Someone can use peek to record animgif in Linux https://github.com/phw/peek. @Angtrim \n\nAbout these lint warnings below: do you use these variables at all? There is variables like event, modifier, etc used in fuctions, but they are not used at all in functions. Can they be safely removed? If yes, can you add PR to edge branch?\n```\n~/repos/wekan$ npm run lint\n\nwekan@1.52.1 lint /home/user/repos/wekan\neslint --ignore-pattern 'packages/*' .\n\n/home/user/repos/wekan/client/components/rules/rulesActions.js\n  44:38  warning  'event' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  47:37  warning  'event' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  50:37  warning  'event' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  53:42  warning  'event' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n/home/user/repos/wekan/client/components/rules/rulesMain.js\n  27:32  warning  'event' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n/home/user/repos/wekan/client/components/rules/rulesTriggers.js\n  42:39  warning  'event' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  45:38  warning  'event' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  48:43  warning  'event' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n/home/user/repos/wekan/models/checklistItems.js\n  121:60  warning  'modifier' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  139:62  warning  'modifier' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n/home/user/repos/wekan/models/wekanCreator.js\n  513:37  warning  'ruleIndex' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  528:35  warning  'ruleIndex' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n  543:31  warning  'ruleIndex' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\n/home/user/repos/wekan/server/rulesHelper.js\n  63:13  warning  'emailTo' is assigned a value but never used       no-unused-vars\n  64:13  warning  'emailMsg' is assigned a value but never used      no-unused-vars\n  65:13  warning  'emailSubject' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars\n\u2716 16 problems (0 errors, 16 warnings)\n```. Wekan v1.53.2 snap+docker included latest IFTTT+LDAP, please test what works, but make sure you have backups. This is very experimental, brand new, and can contain bugs, or not work at all.. Moved to #1160. Please:\n- remove all console.log statements\n- Fix all lint errors and warnings\n- Add Snap settings to code so that CAS is default disabled, and can be enabled with Snap commands\n- Add Snap settings to wiki\n- Add settings to Dockerfile\n- Make your pull request to edge branch with all of CAS code included. I will soon remove CAS from stable, because CAS if not fully tested yet.. @ppoulard \nSo if debug option set, Meteor package will not output messages to console?\nWekan in not configured by .conf files. Wekan settings are set with environment variables for all Wekan platforms: source, Snap, Docker, VirtualBox, Sandstorm. On some Wekan platforms Wekan code part is read only, it's much harder to add .conf file. Environment variables work on all platforms.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Platforms\nSnap https://snapcraft.io is package format similar to Docker. It is originally created by Canonical, and is available for many linux distros. Snap has sandboxing and automatic updates. Docker does not have automatic updates. There are some stats at https://wekan.team , currently Snap package is installed to over 3000 servers worldwide. Snap package is at Snap store https://snapcraft.io/wekan , there is also map of some countries where Wekan is used.\nThere should also be wiki page about what CAS is, how to setup it, are there open source CAS servers, etc how CAS works, briefly with links to elsewhere where is more info.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/CAS\nThat CAS wiki page should also be added below OAuth2 in wiki sidebar:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/_Sidebar/_edit\nSo currently because of these CAS belongs to Edge branch:\n- CAS is only available with source installs using .conf file\n- there is no documentation about how to use it\n- settings are not available as environment variables\nAfter the above are added, and it's possible to test CAS someway, CAS is moved to stable master branch.\nEdge branch is where new features first land. There are also other experimental features at edge, like OAuth2 and IFTTT. Often edge is broken in many ways, and not recommended for production.\nI added Edge branch recently, because many times Wekan has got broken when adding major new features.. Sorry about the nonsense, I will add those settings later myself.. Because Docker Hub images many times have been broken, while those built by quay work. Quay also builds docker containers much faster than Docker Hub.. Subtasks on Sandstorm are not fixed yet.. Moved to #1903. You can resend invitation. Does that help?\nThere is still bug \"Unable to verify accounts.\" #1426 \nI have not yet added setting verified on Admin Panel.. @lucg71 \nPlease make backup first:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup\nWekan Snap has mongodb at port 27019.\nYou could try saving mongodb date to .json files, editing them, and copying back to mongodb:\nhttps://forums.rocket.chat/t/big-issue-with-custom-javascript/261/4\nOr google searching for mongodb syntax.. Well, maybe for future versions.\nI can not change and re-release old versions.. But the actual solution to import/export errors is not adding version number.\nActual solution is to make script that:\n- does git checkout to each Wekan version\n- extracts database schema from wekan/models/* including import/export, and wekan/server/migrations.js\n- makes sure every old schema is migrated to newest Wekan version\n- detects file format of imported JSON, and makes sure every old import/export file format can be imported.\nRelated #1695. @sfahrenholz \nYes it is inconvenient currently.\nSorry, I'm currently in work project that has very tight deadline, so I can not code this enchancement yet.\nI really depend on all Wekan contributors to and companies using Wekan to help and submit pull requests for fixes. If it's only me coding this, progress is slow. Wekan is community effort.. @InfoSec812 \nCan you look at this?. @lberk \nThanks! I added link to this solution to wiki:\nhttps://wekan.github.io => Download Stable => OpenShift\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/OpenShift. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings\n. @plyaskin \nI fixed wiki page.\nWekan uses localhost port 3001 usually.\nNginx https proxies to Wekan localhost 3001 node.\n. @Nocan456 \nIt's not possible to disable Snap automatic updates.\nThose that want specific Wekan version without automatic updates use Docker with specific release tag. They test newest Wekan version before upgrading.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Docker. @schulz\nWhat Wekan GitHub issue numbers this fixes?. @dcmcand \nPlease test it. If you get it working, add PR to edge branch.. I don't know. Someone shoud try to set it up, and see if it requires adding some code back, that does adding it break anything. If someone gets it working, he/she can add PR to edge branch.. Delete Card is in More menu, because many did accidentally delete important card. I did get many worried bug reports about it. It's more safe to move card to Recycle Bin.. No. Current Wekan UI is in Wekan long time users muscle memory. There is huge support cost if some option suddenly disappears. If you would like to hide something, use upcoming Custom CSS or add new Role #1994. @cannycartographer \nHow do you drag and drop text?\nI would think that it's only possible to copy and paste text.. Newest Wekan does not use native bcrypt because of security issue and no one adding working native bcrypt.\nOld Wekan versions are not supported.. @Madko \nYes. There was security issue in binary bcrypt, so I needed to remove it some time ago.\nI tried to add binary bcrypt back after it was fixed, but fix was incomplete and did not work.\nIf someone is interested in adding binary bcrypt back, he/she can try to get it working and add PR to edge branch.. @Madko \nI have not had crashes with Wekan in regular use, I don't know what you mean.\nBcrypt has nothing to do with any crashes. There is no difference is bcrypt implemented in binary or Javascript.. You have old version of Wekan, Node and Mongo. I would recommed trying to install using newest docker-compose.yml in edge branch. It has Node 8.12.0, Mongo 4.0.3 etc.. You see logs at Docker this way:\ndocker logs wekan-app. @Madko \nBuild script for edge is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-maintainer/blob/master/releases/rebuild-wekan-edge.sh\nI have not tested it on CentOS 7. You can add PR to add more to it, if you have time.. @Madko \nYou can specify Wekan version when using Docker.\ndocker-compose.yml has this line, that gets latest version:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan\nEvery Wekan release has git tag. You see them at https://github.com/wekan/wekan repo Branch: devel dropdown, and also at commandline using command git tag.\nYou get specific release of Wekan by using tag of image:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:v1.69\n@GavinLilly \nWhat version of Wekan you are running? I could make new Docker version of Wekan, that uses newer version Meteor 1.8.x, I think it is a little faster.. @GavinLilly \nYou can try these Docker tags:\n1) Meteor 1.8.x with Node 8.12.0, that node could use more CPU:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8\n2) Meteor 1.8.x with Node 8.11.4, that node could use less CPU:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8-node-8.11.4\nYou can see when those tags finish building at:\nhttps://quay.io/repository/wekan/wekan?tab=builds\nMeteor 1.8.x does also work with newer MongoDB, like mongo tag 4.0.3.\nBut I have not got Meteor 1.8.x and MongoDB 4.0.3 working with Snap version, because Node connecting to Mongo did not work on Snap. So they only work on Docker currently.. Meteor 1.8 version is defined here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/meteor-1.8/.meteor/release#L1. PR is now merged.\nDocker image is currently building, you can test it soon with this image:\nquay.io/wekan/wekan:v1.55.1\nAlso edge tag is building, so it should be available also there soon. Edge tag always contains latest.. @Oznup \nPlease try latest docker-compose.yml:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/wekan/wekan/devel/docker-compose.yml\nFor example, you have wrong docker image of wekanteam/wekan. Please use quay image.\nIf you still have problems, please add new issue to:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap/issues\nOr look is there existing ldap issue on above url.. @andresmanelli \nCan you look at this?. Try newest Wekan.. Try this:\n1. Export to Wekan JSON\n2. Try to Import Wekan JSON\n3. If it does not work, remove Custom Field(s) from JSON and Import\n4. If it does not work, remove Activities from JSON and Import\n. Another way is to try to backup Wekan v0.10.1 MongoDB database and restore it to Snap MongoDB:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup\nAnd then start Wekan to see does it upgrade database schema automatically.. Yes. v0.10.1 was released 2015-12-30:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v0101-2015-12-30. @bentiss \nFor changes to REST API, please document it to wiki directly to some related or new page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API-Role. @Angtrim \nCan you look at this?. What commands you use to generate documentation?\nPlease separate API to different pages by topic, like at Wekan GitHub wiki. Now they are at one very long page, it's very hard to find info fast.\nIt would be very nice to generate Wekan documentation website that had well organized navigation.. One possible way to present documentation would be like Sandstorm does:\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/tree/master/docs\nWekan docs were originally moved from GitHub repo to GitHub wiki so it would be easier for Wekan contributors to update documentation. Not many documentation contributors are familiar with adding PRs.. Current way to contribute documentation is to add text to wiki, and add PR to Wekan website to host images or animgifs. It would be nice to make contributing even easier.. @bentiss \nSlate looks very nice.\nCould this PR go to Wekan website?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan.github.io\nAnd then generated documentation would be at api directory, https://wekan.github.io/api ?. @bentiss \nOk, so maybe you could add generating openapi to public directory to these Wekan GitHub org repo files. You can presume all repos are cloned to same directory with this script, and generate docs to all directories where they need to be.\nwekan/wekan\n- Dockerfile\n- snapcraft.yaml\nwekan/wekan-maintainer\n- releases/rebuild-wekan.sh\n- releases/release-wekan-snap.sh\n- releases/release-wekan-sanstorm.sh\n- virtualbox/rebuild-wekan.sh\nwekan/wekan.github.io\n- api/v1.68 etc\n. @bentiss \nThanks! It looks very nice!. > I have now 2 question @xet7 : \n\n\nfor generating the snaps, which debian/ubuntu version are you using? The container on dockerhub to generate snapcrafts is using Ubuntu 16.04 IIRC, and this doesn't ship with python 3.6\n\n\nI have Ubuntu 18.04 on bare metal server, where downloads are hosted, there is Python 3.6.6, so I can generate documentation there, and have docs at for example https://docs.wekan.team/v1.70/... \nI build Snap and Sandstorm versions on Ubuntu 16.04 VM on server, because Snap build service is slower.\nDocker is built automatically at https://quay.io/wekan/wekan\nThere could be cron job that builds docs and for example .tar.gz of those docs, and Dockerfile and snapcraft.yaml could download those to some directory into package itself, if those docs needs to be embedded into package.\n\n\nCan you have a look at the JSDocs I put and tell me if this is acceptable? (especially the @return_type tag)\n\n\nWhat do you mean? Where?. I mean https://api.wekan.team/v1.70/.... I have not created that https://api.wekan.team subdomain yet.\nI don't know is embedding API docs good idea. If someone is running many Wekan Docker containers to use multiple cores of server, space usage really adds up.. I don't know is there any problem with return_type tag etc, because I'm not so familiar with OpenAPI. If there is sometime later some improvement, then that can be added.\nI would think there should be just a script to run and have these at https://api.wekan.team/... for a start.\nAlso some hosting providers run multiple instances of Wekan on same server for different customers, space usage does add up.. Ok, then yaml needs to be included into Wekan, because Wekan does not load any content from outside links by default, that is core Wekan security feature for offline use.. Hmm, probably it would be good to have documentation added to translatable strings and have all that in embedded into wekan as help buttons (or something similar) so that every feature would documented, with descriptions what would be there. Also Wekan website text could be added to translatable strings and have Wekan website in many languages.. Please make these changes:\n- show both WIP Limit and number of cards at the same time. Do not hide some of them.\n- change WIP Limit, for example (3/1), black font color to something else (not blue - that color means link), and also change WIP Limit color on List hamburger menu. That way it's easy to see what is WIP limit color and what is card count black.\n- (Maybe: if there is then problem with how much space WIP limit + card count uses, maybe change font of them to smaller). @bentiss \nI think you shoud drop both first and second patch. Currently when there is WIP limit and card count this way, it looks nice already for me. Adding more parentheses just makes it more complex.\nCardname (3/1) 3 cards. @bentiss \nWhat if card count would be italic?. @bentiss \nSmaller font could also work. Text 3 cards is quite long, so in some cases it could go to 2 lines.\nYou could add screenshots about how these italic and smaller font would look like.. Smaller one is very nice :). @andresmanelli \nCan you look at this?\nI looked at it a little. In this file:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/server/notifications/outgoing.js\nI added some console logs:\n```\nMeteor.methods({\n  outgoingWebhooks(integrations, description, params) {\n    check(integrations, Array);\n    check(description, String);\n    check(params, Object);\nconst quoteParams = _.clone(params);\n['card', 'list', 'oldList', 'board', 'comment'].forEach((key) => {\n  if (quoteParams[key]) quoteParams[key] = `\"${params[key]}\"`;\n});\n\nconst userId = (params.userId)?params.userId:integrations[0].userId;\nconsole.log('params.userid: ' + params.userId);\nconsole.log('integrations[0].userid: ' + integrations[0].userId);\nconst user = Users.findOne(userId);\nconsole.log('user: ' + user);\nconsole.log('params.user: ' + `${params.user}`);\nconst text = `${params.user} ${TAPi18n.__(description, quoteParams, user.getLanguage())}\\n${params.url}`;\nconsole.log('text: ' + text);\n\nif (text.length === 0) return;\n\nconst value = {\n  text: `${text}`,\n};\n\nAnd with running `meteor` on wekan repo directory it outputs:\n=> Meteor server restarted\nI20181024-21:55:52.922(3)? params.userid: 3i35yAbpN8o9tnJ\nI20181024-21:55:52.923(3)? integrations[0].userid: 3i35yAbpN8o9tnJ\nI20181024-21:55:52.923(3)? user: [object Object]\nI20181024-21:55:52.923(3)? params.user: testtest\nI20181024-21:55:52.925(3)? text: testtest added member to \"rjeiore\"\nI20181024-21:55:52.925(3)? http://localhost:4000/b/suhT8NX6GbTRNvFfZ/welcome-board/rtFKKyiaEGADzhmaC\nOn Wekan board activities is:\ntesttest added to cardname. 6 minutes ago\nBut it shoud be:\ntesttest added testtesttest to cardname. 6 minutes ago\nAnd in both Slack and Rocket.Chat it shows the same:\nincoming-webhook APP [9:55 PM]\ntesttest added member to \"cardname\"\nhttp://localhost:4000/b/suhT8NX6GbTRNvFfZ/welcome-board/rtFKKyiaEGADzhmaC\n```\nSome time ago webhook parameters was added. Maybe some parameter is missing? Any ideas?. Moved to #2226. @GuiGuiSoft \nPlease test beta version, does fix work now:\nsudo snap refresh wekan --beta --amend\nAnd then add your settings, and try login.\nIf it works, I will add it to stable. You can change to stable later this way:\nsudo snap refresh wekan --stable --amend. @GuiGuiSoft \nFix is now at stable. You can change to stable this way:\nsudo snap refresh wekan --stable --amend. @Angtrim \nCan you look at this?. @BurakTuran9 \nThanks! I will include it in next Wekan release.. I included some tips for fixing in above commit. I was not able to figure it out yet, I did run out of time. Help welcome.. Moved to #1969 . Moved to #1874. @maximest-pierre \nWhat would be best solution to this?. @imkwx \nIt would be nice if you can also add changes to all other places too:\n- wekan/docker-compose-build.yml\n- wekan/snap-src/config\n- wekan/snap-src/wekan-help\n- check is there something else at wekan/snapcraft.yaml or wekan/snap-src/* that needs changing\n- wekan-ldap readme etc. @Michagogo \nWell, there is for example this:\nhttps://github.com/staskorz/meteor-ntlm-example\nBut I have no way to test it. Someone having Windows Domain could look at it.\nThere is also some SAML packages here:\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/tomwasd/flow-router-seo?q=saml\nAnd https://sandstorm.io already has SAML, but I don't know is it possible to bypass requirement to click SAML login button.\n. @danpatdav \nOne way to get Kerberos into Wekan would be that some Javascript developer in your company look at adding kerberos package:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/kerberos\nand existing LDAP code in Wekan:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap\nAuth0 login #1722 is coming to Wekan sometime, there is already some Meteor code in private repo that works with Auth0 and RocketChat, that needs to be cleaned up and added to Wekan. Auth0 has SAML, OAuth2 etc.\nIt could also help if someone would add bounty to this issue similarly like there is already for adding siteminder auth.. Moved to SAML issue #708. No problem :) Please also add other changes to this PR.. Thanks!. Yes, that Linked Card/Linked Board has not been yet fixed to work on Sandstorm. That feature shows other board's card on current board, and would probably require Wekan Sandstorm version to support multiple boards to be useful.\n. Yes, these features do not make much sense when using only one board.\nI will hide them.\nEnabling multiple boards on Sandstorm would most likely require a lot of work and break workflows Sandstorm users are used to. I think currently getting Sandstorm bugs fixed would be more useful than adding multiple boards.. I added some beginning of build scripts here, but did run out of time, please try to add more to them as PRs. They are not finished yet.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/rebuild-wekan.bat\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/edge/start-wekan.bat. Current way Custom Fields work is at wiki:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Custom-Fields\nYes, someone could develop feature that new cards automatically have custom field, and add PR.. @okobloko \nTry:\n1. Stop and Start Docker\n2. Export board to Wekan JSON\n3. Import Wekan JSON\nDoes it work?. @okobloko \nSome Wekan users avoid using Subtasks and Custom Fields because they still have some bugs.\nFor example with subtasks, this does break board:\n1. Create subtask on Wekan board.\n2. On subtask board, move card to other board.\n3. Because Wekan board can't find subtask anymore, Wekan board gets broken.. @okobloko \nThere are some Swimlane bugs like #1971 #1887 #1784 but I don't think those would break Wekan board. If you find out how you did get Wekan board to break, please add info as comment to this issue.. @okobloko \nI would guess that your old backup of Wekan would work if you remove all Subtask related data from MongoDB.. @tugal \nDo first the one use case that is most important for your project to get your project completed, ask from your end user that will be using your project what they would prefer. You can try leaflet or other free open source map code and provider.. Moved to #755 , there is $10 bounty for map/location feature, so you @tugal can have it if you want. Or alternatively, if you don't want it, you can donate it to me to support my maintaining of Wekan.. @tugal\nYou can add new user role to Wekan like \"No Comments\" role does not show any comments, acivities etc. That issue #1861 has links to GitHub commits how that can be done. Setting that role is available to board admin in web UI by clicking board right sidebar / user avatar / permission. It's also possible to change role with REST API https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API-Role\nWekan does not yet have for example view only role.\n. Also look at ChangeLog about what other role fixes I did to get it working.. Moved to #1861. Yes, this feature does not exist yet. Linked card can be modified only on original board.. This should be optional, to select is editing linked card possible or not. Because otherwise someone could modify linked card that is for viewing only.. @hever \nOnly new feature English text is added to en.i18.json in PRs. Other language translations are only accepted at Transifex https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan. There is button \"Translate Wekan at Transifex\" at Wekan readme https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/README.md. @hever \nI will change button back to text and make it bigger. Making it to button was not a good idea.. @hever \nNow readme has translation link as text and bigger.. @rgalonso \nOoops, strange effect with that change, columns don't align.\n\n. Merged. Will be in next release.. Strange, login works for me on snap 1.71.0\nDo you still have root-url etc set correctly?

I will revert to previous version where login did work.. Login failure is already fixed.. Thanks! I fixed that outdated page.\nIf you notice something else outdated on wiki, you can fix it directly by editing wiki pages. Wiki is community maintained.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Excel-and-VBA\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API-Cards\nThere look at adding receivedAt value to card API call.. You need to login to API first before doing those card API calls:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API. Moved to #1969. @jeyca \nNo, Wekan requires MongoDB.\nIf Uberspace 7 can run docker containers, then you could use docker-compose.yml that is at https://github.com/wekan/wekan\nThere is related #787 and mention about nice-to-have other databases at blog post but currently it looks like adding other database support would require a lot of work, so probably will not happen soon.. @nightwind27 \n\n\nDo you mean 12/24 etc time at #2011 ?\n\n\nDo you mean some existing Subtask issue or new one? You could add new issue with screenshot mockup and more complete description.\n\n\nWhat is missing from Wekan in agile and lean kanban?\n\n\nWhat rule is important in kanban? How it should be enhanced? Is there existing issue about that, or can you add that?\n\n\nWekan has some logs and statistics features and sometime later is planned to be developed per-board statistics.\n\n\nYou can support Wekan development by using my Commercial Support, my paying customers make development of features and bugfixes and my maintaining of Wekan possible.\nInfo about what happened in this year and some future plans for Wekan are at this blog post. What is required for Agile Lean Devops? Screenshots, feature descriptions, etc?. No. It would break markdown formatting on all Wekan boards that have been installed to thousands of servers.. Did you login first to Standalone Wekan (Snap/Docker/Source) with user that has Admin Panel rights, to get valid Bearer string like that x4... ?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API#example-call---as-form-data\nAnd after that, did you use REST API (or saved exported Wekan JSON) to get correct board ID and list ID ?. @arradoq \nI would think in that case you could try using VBA-Web at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Excel-and-VBA\nI have not tried that in Excel, I don't have Excel installed currently.\nAt https://github.com/wekan/wekan is .bat files that also install curl, but I have not used curl to access Wekan on Windows yet.. For more complete example of accessing Wekan API, you could look at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs .. @arradoq \nIs there same problem with using curl on ubuntu bash? I'm trying to read this issue and figure out what is the actual problem.. @arradoq \nWhat version of Excel are you trying to use with Wekan?. @arradoq \nFirst you login with username and password as Form Data:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API#example-call---as-form-data\nThe you change that token to examples to the right side of word \"Bearer\" in next API calls, so you get list of users, list of boards user has, etc. These calls after login use JSON in queries.. @arradoq \nDid you look at links at this page, using REST API directly with VBA? Did you try it?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Excel-and-VBA. You need to login first with username and password of admin user as form data to get bearer token that you use at next api calls in right side of Bearer word\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API#example-call---as-form-data . There are  some generated API docs at temporary address:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1965#issuecomment-455606651\nIn general, after login as form data, with bearer token you get list of users, board of user, etc\n. And after login as form data other API calls are as JSON data (not form data). If you get normal html as response then login bearer token is expired. To api call also you need to change api url, board id etc other ids to replace those in examples. @arradog\nThere is also more complete integration example in Javascript at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs\nAnd Python API client at\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-python-api-client\nDid you have any progress with VBA ?\nI have been thinking that maybe I should make more complete examples for different programming languages.. Yes, bundle needs to be created, and WITH_API set, and then run it with node. This needs to be done once to get C/C++ etc dependencies built.\nIf you are developing, you can run cd wekan && WITH_API=true meteor so that meteor watches does some file change in Wekan directories, and automatically rebuild bundle.\nYes, that rebuild-wekan.sh script is just temporary solution. Usually meteor projects can be built with setting environment variables and then running meteor. Having this in Wekan requires copying Wekan dependecies like wekan-ldap etc repos copied to wekan/packages directory, and some other changes. There is in-progress PR https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2124 to enable this (needs testing and cherry picking), but it remains to be seen does it make thouse build scripts unnecessary, most likely it just makes scripts shorter.\nEnvironment variables are for Wekan settings, in source/Snap/Docker/Sandstorm etc, for the reason that they are user modifiable, and Wekan bundle does not need rebuilding to change settings, because those settings are not hardcoded in source code.. In ChangeLog that change was reverted because login did not work at all. There is fixed PR that I will try to test and include to next Wekan release.. Wekan only has Outgoing Webhooks going from Wekan to other software like Slack/Rocket.Chat/etc.\n1) Is that Outgoing Webhook URL the address of NodeRed ?\n2) Does NodeRed have incoming webhook that supports incoming Wekan data in this format ?\n3) For getting data into Wekan, there is Wekan REST API. Does it work for you?. @andyprv \nI added incoming HTTP POST to NodeRed:\n\nThen I added debug:\n\nAnd Outgoing Wekan Webhook, that seems to send changes as seen above:\n\nI installed NodeRed like described here, also installing chatbot:\nhttps://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-chatbot. Also, in NodeRed you need to click Deploy to deploy new HTTP Post etc changes.. Here is all steps I did:\n1) Install Docker and docker-compose to Ubuntu 16.04 64bit\n2) Deleted and cleaned up all docker data, so that Wekan starts correctly:\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/docker-cleanup-volumes\ncd docker-cleanup-volumes\n./start.sh\n3) Cloned wekan repo and started wekan\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan\ncd wekan\ndocker-compose up -d\n4) Installed Node 8.15.0\nsudo apt-get install npm build-essential\nsudo npm -g install npm\nsudo npm -g install n\nsudo n 8.15.0\n5) Installed node-red according to https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-chatbot\nsudo npm -g install node-red\ncd ~/.node-red\nnpm install node-red-contrib-chatbot\nnode-red\n6) Added node-red http-in /wekan and debug as above screenshot, added line between them, clicked deploy\n7) At wekan http://localhost registered new account and logged in with same credentials\n8) Created new board and added outgoing webhook to http://127.0.0.1:1880/wekan\n9) Docker does not send any changes of creating cards and lists, or moving cards\n10) Built from source and run\ncd wekan\n./rebuild-wekan.sh\nAnd with 1 install dependencies, and 2 build from source\n11) Edit start-wekan.sh to have ROOT_URL=http://localhost and PORT=80\n12) Allowed wekan on port 80\ncd wekan\n./releases/virtualbox/node-allow-port-80.sh\n13) Install MongoDB 3.2.21 according to Ubuntu MongoDB docs\n14) Start Wekan\ncd wekan\n./start-wekan.sh\n15) Add new board and outgoing webhook to http://127.0.0.1:1880/wekan\n16) And from source it works.\n17) But docker does not work. Is it because some Docker network settings? Is there limited access in Docker to localhost ports? Or does nodered need to be in some docker container, defined to wekan network defined in docker-compose.yml ?. Maybe this could help?\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662/from-inside-of-a-docker-container-how-do-i-connect-to-the-localhost-of-the-mach. To connect to localhost, instead of http://127.0.0.1:1880/wekan , please try:\nDocker for Mac:\nhttp://host.docker.internal:1880/wekan\nor\nhttp://docker.for.mac.host.internal:1880/wekan\nor\nhttp://docker.for.mac.localhost:1880/wekan\nDocker for Windows:\nhttp://host.docker.internal:1880/wekan\nor\nhttp://docker.for.win.localhost. It seems that Wekan source/snap/docker on Linux outgoing webhooks to Rocket.Chat snap incoming webhook chat channel works with copying webhook url to Wekan board.\nBut, it seems that:\n- Linux source/Docker/snap webhook to Discord does not work at all anymore, it did before\n- on Mac sending Wekan Docker outgoing Webhooks does not work, most likely because of Mac networking etc does not work well\n- on Linux sending from source Wekan to source NodeRed works on localhost to localhost, but from Docker to localhost needs some setup that I did not yet figure out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662/from-inside-of-a-docker-container-how-do-i-connect-to-the-localhost-of-the-mach\n- most likely if some other webhook code is included into same docker-compose.yml to use same docker internal wekan-tier network, outgoing webhook to that webhook receiving code would work\nThese still need more testing, because it feels like sometimes some of the above works, and sometime not.. @andyprv \nYou docker command above does not specify MongoDB version.\nquay.io/wekan/wekan:v2.01 is compatible with MongoDB 3.2.21 and\nquay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8 is with MongoDB 4.x. @andyprv\nAll environment settings are documented in docker-compose.yml at https://github.com/wekan/wekan. @NerikBnp \nPlease add examples of 3rd party authentication server software.\nWekan already has LDAP.\nIt's also possible to add Google login proxybouncer in front Wekan login.\nCAS and OIDC partially work already.\nLater there will probably be also RocketChat, Google and Auth0 login.\nSAML is in Sandstorm Wekan, but not on Standalone Wekan yet.\nFriend login will be added sometime.\nDo you mean some of these, or something else?. Oh OK, you mean secure login without using passwords.\nWould you prefer adding SSO to Wekan with:\na) siteminder\nb) SQRL. SQRL is secure single factor, and does not use any passwords.. I'm working on this. I will add comment to this issue when there is some progress.. @NerikBnp \n1) About Sandstorm:\n\nSAML : we\u2019ve set up a sandstorm sso instance but faced issues with set up due to cloud restrictions in place as well as user experience being much less nice than wekan standalone\n\nWhen you tried Sandstorm, do you mean with user experience that there is only only one board per grain? Yesterday I added multiple boards per grain, Admin Panel etc more features of Standalone Wekan to Sandstorm Wekan #2208 but not all those features work yet. Do these make Sandstorm more usable, or is Standalone Wekan still better for you? Are your cloud restrictions too strict to have Sandstorm well installed?\n2) About Standalone Wekan and Siteminder:\n- Does Siteminder support OIDC OAuth2 login? Wekan supports 3rd party OIDC authentication servers like Keycloak that is Open Source, Keycloak settings are at Wiki. You did test Sandstorm with SAML, but Wekan does not have SAML in Standalone Wekan version yet. OIDC login experience is that OIDC button is clicked (or in future, redirected directly to auth login page) and then after logging to 3rd party auth user is redirected back to Wekan.\n- For HTTP header, would it be enough that to Admin Panel / People I would add new column that would have editable field for required HTTP header for that user?. @NerikBnp\nWould you have time to answer my questions in above comment?. @NerikBnp \nAnyway, I presume I'll start by adding column for HTTP header for each user to Standalone Wekan Admin Panel, and then trying to make Wekan check for that header.. @NerikBnp \nI will create trial account to siteminder so that I could try to do some testing. Although, I don't know yet what kind of trial account to create, I try to figure it out. It would be helpful if you could send me email to x@xet7.org if you could create some test account for me to siteminder, so I could test this.. @NerikBnp \nCan you try again with some example Oidc settings like these, that do work already?\n- Keycloak: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Keycloak\n- Auth0 OIDC: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/OAuth2#auth0\n- Azure: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Azure\n. @NerikBnp \nWhen mapping fields with Oidc to wekan, those fields like username etc will be available for Wekan code so Wekan could check for some kind of header that is combined from those, but I would need more details about how that header is made like what it looks like, how user info is combined to it, etc, so I could check correct type of header with code.. For example, Wekan login page could have some check, that if some general part of header exists, then also check other parts of header does it have username or some other identifying info, search does that user exist in database, and if yet, then login user.. In that case, there would only need to be settings input box and save button (or environment varible setting) for generic part of header that is always the same, and other data would be get directly from Oidc mappings.. For what kind of settings or user data?. Usually identity providers like LDAP, Oidc etc can provide many kinds of user data, like username, full name, phone number, etc. Depends what kind of data is needed to be in Wekan to make login work, or have visible when clicking board member avatar.. At Standalone Wekan Admin Panel / People there is table where I can add new columns for additional user data, that would be needed in Wekan, and have that info provided from Oidc mappings. I would think that using environment variable setting would be easiest to add in this case.\nIt would be set for example this way:\nSnap\nsudo snap set wekan siteminder-header='abcd12345'\nDocker\nTo docker-compose.yml at https://github.com/wekan/wekan\nexport SITEMINDER_HEADER=abcd12345. > data we could get in headers are:\n\nUID (our own corporate employee identifier)\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail Address\nCountry code (not sure this one would be useful though)\n\nIs Country code required for logging in to Wekan? Or can it be leaved to not checked? Is that info needed to be visible in Wekan at all?. I would think that for this feature, steps would be:\n1) You try to get Oidc login working.\n2) I will add setting siteminder-header and checking headers for user to Wekan.\n3) You test does it work.\nThat way I would most likely not need to have siteminder to test it myself.. Just quessing your OIDC settings:\nSiteminder settings\nClient ID:                                 <== Copy to below snap settings\nSecret:                                    <== Copy to below snap settings\nAccount url: youraccount.siteminder.com    <== Copy to below snap settings\nApplication Logo:                          <== Add your logo\nApplication Type: Single Page Application\nToken Endpoint Authentication Method: Post\nAllowed Callback URLs: https://wekan.yourcompany.com/_oauth/oidc  <== Change your Wekan address\nAllowed Web Origins: https://wekan.yourcompany.com                <== Change your Wekan address\nSnap\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-enabled='true'\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-client-id='abcde12345'\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-secret='54321abcde'\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-server-url='https://yourcompany.siteminder.com'\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-auth-endpoint='/oauth/authorize'\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-userinfo-endpoint='/oauth/userinfo'\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-token-endpoint='/oauth/token'\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-id-map='uid'\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-username-map='preferred_username'   (or: name, or: uid, or: firstname)\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-fullname-map='given_name'        (or: name, or: lastname, or: fullname)\nsudo snap set wekan oauth2-email-map='email'\nDocker\ndocker-compose.yml at https://github.com/wekan/wekan\nexport OAUTH2_ENABLED=true\nexport OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=abcd12345\nexport OAUTH2_SECRET=54321abcde\nexport OAUTH2_SERVER_URL=https://yourcompany.siteminder.com/\nexport OAUTH2_AUTH_ENDPOINT=/oauth/authorize\nexport OAUTH2_USERINFO_ENDPOINT=/oauth/userinfo\nexport OAUTH2_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=/oauth/token\nexport OAUTH2_ID_MAP=uid\nexport OAUTH2_USERNAME_MAP=preferred_username  (or: name, or: uid)\nexport OAUTH2_FULLNAME_MAP=given_name     (or: name, or: fullname)\nexport OAUTH2_EMAIL_MAP=email. @lnvr nvr \nWhat errors you get in Oidc login? When you add these settings and look error logs?\nSnap\nsudo snap set wekan debug='true'\nThen login and check logs\nsudo snap logs wekan.wekan\nMore detailed logs:\nsudo systemctl status snap.wekan.wekan\nDocker\ndocker-compose.yml from https://github.com/wekan/wekan\nexport DEBUG=true\nAnd then login and look at logs:\ndocker logs wekan-db\n. @lnvr \nNevermind my above question about OIDC, it's good LDAP login works. So then it's just that I try to make LDAP login with those headers.. > so my guess is \u201call you might have to do\u201d is a global variable to set auth to siteminder.\n\nand if that then consume headers (that could be session variable too) either to start user session or to create a user on 1st connection.\n\nOk, then I think it would be like these:\nSnap\nsudo snap set wekan siteminder-enabled='true'\nDocker\nexport SITEMINDER_ENABLED=true. @lnvr\nActually, now that I think of it, there is more general use case, partially related to #2195, so this would not need to be siteminder-specific. There would be following settings. Then, if someone has Apache or other webserver providing headers, Wekan would automatically login.\nBut does headers not include password? I would think that usually login to LDAP is with password.\nSnap\nsudo snap set wekan header-login-id='BNPPUID'\nsudo snap set wekan header-login-firstname='BNPPFIRSTNAME'\nsudo snap set wekan header-login-lastname='BNPPLASTNAME'\nsudo snap set wekan header-login-email='BNPPEMAILADDRESS'\nDocker\nexport HEADER_LOGIN_ID=BNPPUID\nexport HEADER_LOGIN_FIRSTNAME=BNPPFIRSTNAME\nexport HEADER_LOGIN_LASTNAME=BNPPLASTNAME\nexport HEADER_LOGIN_EMAIL=BNPPEMAILADDRESS. @lnvr \nBut does headers not include password? I would think that usually login to LDAP is with password.. @lnvr \nFor Wekan LDAP username, do you currently use BNPPUID or BNPPEMAILADDRESS ?. Actually, my question above is irrelevant, because it could be changed in settings. Nevermind.. @lnvr \nPlease test latest Wekan, does it work. I don't know how it would be possible to login to LDAP without password, so maybe ID or something else could be used as password. If needed, you can also try setting default authentication method to LDAP at Admin Panel / Layout.\nSnap\nsudo snap set wekan header-login-id='BNPPUID'\nsudo snap set wekan header-login-email='BNPPEMAILADDRESS'\nDocker\nexport HEADER_LOGIN_ID=BNPPUID\nexport HEADER_LOGIN_EMAIL=BNPPEMAILADDRESS. @lnvr \nCurrently for Wekan LDAP login, with above settings email address is used as username/email and BNPPUID is used as password when logging in to LDAP.. @lnvr \nYou can also set debug, to see are there errors when logging in:\nSnap\nBefore trying to login\nsudo snap set wekan debug='true'\nAfter trying to login, to see logs\nsudo snap logs wekan.wekan\nsudo systemctl status snap.wekan.wekan\nDocker\nBefore trying to login, in docker-compose.yml\nexport DEBUG=true\nAfter trying to login, to see logs:\ndocker logs wekan-app. @lnvr @hever \nI made some fixes and released Wekan v2.47. Please test does Wekan v2.47 work for you now.. @lnvr \nSorry, I did not test it yet. I'm in progress of registering Siteminder trial account so that I could do some testing, and make it work.\nIt seems that changes I added did break LDAP login, so I need to revert some of those in next release. After that, I will make testing with Siteminder, and when it works, make new Wekan release.\n. @lnvr \nI did release Wekan v2.48 that makes LDAP login work again using normal non-siteminder LDAP login.\nI did register for trial account at Siteminder, but they have not yet provided me with trial account. \nThere is no header login code enabled at Wekan v2.48, because currently I don't have any way to test any code changes with siteminder. So options are:\na) Wait until Sitemider company contacts me to provide trial account. Because today is friday, I would presume they contact me sometime next week.\nb) You provide me a way to test my code changes with Siteminder. You can email me to x@xet7.org to provide details.. @lnvr \nSiteminder contacted me, and I registered as partner to SiteMinder Exchange, so their technology partner department will contact me and provide a way to test Wekan with SiteMinder. So there is progress.. Because your other emails work, problem is not in your email settings.\nThere could be some bug in password reset code.. @GavinLilly \nDo you still use Wekan v1.74 ?. @GavinLilly \nWhat SMTP server you use? Does it have any rate limits?\nWekan will use https://atmospherejs.com/msavin/sjobs package for scheduled jobs, so I'm thinking if more of Wekan functionality would be moved to scheduled jobs and not so much run in main process.\nFor example, if one scheduled job would check for forgot password queue and then send emails.\nWould that work?. @GavinLilly \nAre you using DavMail ?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. @GavinLilly \nNewest Wekan has 10x lower resource usage, so it's much faster. Does it fix this issue? Please test.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/3c49e2d0edec19eff4f87b0fcc127f924af193fc#commitcomment-32537953. Thanks! Merged at cdb44da71efdba027a82c37e0b9e08d01bde0d0f with only .styl fix, without removing packages.. Correction: merged at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/064a2deaaf4896ddb30c84505c6cbfb6cc18ff9c. Moved to #486. Moved to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/802#issuecomment-443655960. Related https://github.com/saurabharch/push-rest. Related:\nhttps://github.com/caronc/apprise\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19023196. Can you fix merge conflicts?. Moved to #2026. Password value to currentsetting username??. I think this is already in Wekan correctly.. This has many old release tags etc. Can you cleanup this and fix merge conflicts?. I think this is already in Wekan correctly.. This product name PR is already in Wekan. This is not background image PR.. Moved to #486. Moved to #2043. Import/Export of Wekan JSON is not fixed yet.\nMeanwhile, try backup/restore MongoDB database to newest Wekan version to see does database migrations work correctly for your upgrade.\nIf database migration does not work, please reopen this issue with details about what did not work.. All translations are done at https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/ , please add them there.\nOnly new feature changes to wekan/i18n/en.i18n.json are done as PRs.. @urakagi \nLook at Advanced Filter merged PRs for example code.\nAll Standalone Wekan filter features are also in Sandstorm Wekan, so you can add additional filter feature PR to Edge branch\nFor more info, see Developer Docs and Build from Source.\nPlease add any questions you can think of to this issue, so you will have fast progress like beginner developer that added Advanced Filter. And please keep this issue open while your feature is in progress, and not yet finished.\nThanks!. Moved to #1972. @lonix1\nPlease add screenshot mockup.. @levensailor\nCurrent Oauth2 is OIDC that only works with doorkeeper.\nFor other uses it would require adding some compatible Oauth2 package.\nBTW, are you planning to clean up your PR about Features added to Card Details and Board to Room Integration sometime? I recommend contributing your changes to upstream, it has many benefits.\n. Nice, that is a descriptive error message. I'll look how to fix it.\n@Akuket You can also comment on this if you have ideas how to fix this.. There are extra commas , in snap config file. I will remove them and make new release.. Also Dockerfile does not have one backslash \\ so I will add it.. @mingtao13595 @Samunosuke \nPlease test Wekan v1.81 , is this now fixed ?. @mingtao13595 \nThanks for testing! I will revert changes so there is password/LDAP selection again, so it will be possible to login in next release Wekan v1.82.. @mingtao13595 @Samunosuke\nPlease test Wekan v1.82 , is this now fixed ?. Does someone know how to get dockerhub build new tags automatically?\nquay.io/wekan/wekan has newest Wekan.. I did try to setup automatic build to dockerhub, and also did add newest v1.82 tag to dockerhub so that it started building a moment ago. I'll see later did dockerhub builds work.. @danpatdav \nWhat can be updated in Dockerfile?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile. There is newer meteor framework v1.8.x version here:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8\nIs there any difference in amount of vulnerabilities?. @danpatdav \nMeteor 1.8 version works in Docker and Source, but not yet at Snap and Sandstorm. I'll try sometime to get remaining ones working.\nYes you can submit this way:\n- click fork\n- fork to your own github account\n- ssh clone your repo\n- git checkout edge\n- make your changes\n- add, commit, push\n- at GitHub web interface click submit pull request.. @danpatdav \nHow did you check CVEs from docker image?. I upgraded meteor-1.8 branch to newest beta, that was mentioned at 100% CPU usage fixes issue. It would be nice to know did this fix some CVEs. Docker image is currently building.\n```\n$ meteor update --release 1.8.1-beta.8\nkadira:flow-router: updating npm dependencies -- page, qs...                     \nwekan:accounts-cas: updating npm dependencies -- xml2js, cas...\nwekan:wekan-ldap: updating npm dependencies -- ldapjs...\nChanges to your project's package version selections from updating the release:\nautoupdate             upgraded from 1.5.0 to 1.6.0-beta181.8\nbabel-compiler         upgraded from 7.2.0 to 7.2.4\ncaching-compiler       upgraded from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1\nddp-server             upgraded from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0-beta181.8\ndiff-sequence          upgraded from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1\ndynamic-import         upgraded from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1\necmascript             upgraded from 0.12.0 to 0.12.4\nhttp                   upgraded from 1.4.1 to 1.4.2\nminifier-css           upgraded from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1\nmodern-browsers        upgraded from 0.1.2 to 0.1.4-beta181.8\nmodules-runtime        upgraded from 0.10.2 to 0.10.3\nnpm-mongo              upgraded from 3.1.1 to 3.1.2-beta181.8\noauth                  upgraded from 1.2.3 to 1.2.7\npromise                upgraded from 0.11.1 to 0.11.2\nreactive-dict          upgraded from 1.2.1 to 1.3.0-beta181.8\nsession                upgraded from 1.1.8 to 1.2.0-beta181.8\nstandard-minifier-css  upgraded from 1.5.0 to 1.5.2\nwebapp                 upgraded from 1.7.0 to 1.7.2\nwekan: updated to Meteor 1.8.1-beta.8. \n```. @danpatdav \nI finally got Meteor v1.8.0.1 version working. Can you test this tag is there difference in vulnerabilities? Thanks!\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8. @danpatdav \nCan you test again these with your security scanner? base was changed to Ubuntu Cosmic, and there are not any CVEs listed at quay security scan.\n1) image: quay.io/wekan/wekan\n2) image: quay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8\n\n. Newer meteor version is at meteor-1.8 branch:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/meteor-1.8/docker-compose.yml\nThere change:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8\nIt's also possible to use newer MongoDB 4.x with newer meteor:\nimage: mongo:xenial. I added these infos above to installation guide you mentioned above.. @chotaire \nNo. This change fixes long standing critical bug that clicking scrollbar closes scrollbar in chrome. Having scrollbar visible improves usability.. If someone can make it more beautiful in a way it still works well on both desktop and mobile webbrowser, that's OK, PRs welcome.. OIDC does work, with these conditions:\n- you use doorkeeper as identity provider. And not using any other like google/rocketchat/other oauth2, because only doorkeeper works.\n- for doorkeeper, current docs are correct, and do work work with Wekan\n- there is no need to build custom docker image. OIDC is included. Setting environment variables at docker-compose.yml does not mean building custom docker image. It's the same prebuilt docker image with settings from environment variables.. you can use newer meteor-1.8 image, it does have OIDC and less CVEs.. Oops I clicked close issue button by accident, so I reopened this.. Each OAuth2 works differently, depending on setting fields, internal implementation of OAuth2 etc.\nThat's why Rocket.Chat also has Google OAuth2, Custom OAuth2, etc.\nYes, I have tried that OIDC with Wekan, and it always logins as first admin users, not as any other user. That is the bug in that issue, that it's not general, and can not be general It's all differerent.\nSome accounts packages are listed at:\nhttps://guide.meteor.com/accounts.html\nAdding new auth package is mainly just adding that to list of other auth packages. Like adding couple lines of code to have rocketchat login in Wekan. It's not like it's difficult. It just needs someone to have some time to add it.\n. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings\nDockerBunker etc:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Docker. Huh, what app uses .net core? I would presume you just Google search for .net core oauth, or whatever framework you are using for .net core login.\nGitLab is made with Ruby.\nWekan is made with Javascript / Node.js\nWekan GitLab OAuth2 issue is at #109\n. Is Wekan server running on LAN that is not connected to Internet? It should work if there is still connection to Wekan server.\nWekan does not have any offline data caching, so disconnecting from network where Wekan server is does of course prevent Wekan working correctly.. Hmm, that's strange. I'll check does that scrollbar package load anything from Internet, it should not do that.. I started reading scrollbar code, and yes, it's loading from cdn:\nhttps://github.com/MaazAli/Meteor-Malihu-Custom-Scrollbar/blob/master/jquery.mCustomScrollbar.js#L50\nI will fork that package and include it locally to fix this.\nThanks a lot for finding this! By default Wekan does not load anything from Internet, and it should work this way always.. It seems to be only in Firefox:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/35300380/event-not-defined-error-only-in-firefox\nI presume bug is somewhere in new scrollbar code:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-scrollbar. Oh, yes, I checked it now again.\nIt seems to complain that I removed mquandalle's perfectscrollbar package. I'll try to add it back.. Ok seems that complaining stopped after adding perfectscrollbar package back. I will make new release with this fix included.. I just added mquandalle:perfect-scrollbar back so the result is:\nPros\n- visually Wekan looks better\n- clicking and dragging scrollbar still works\n- there is no errors at browser dev console\n- scrolling cards on list works\nCons\n- scrolling comments etc on single card does not work. This could be because I changed mousewheel file path so that I could include it locally #2056 but I think I messed up file path. File jquery.mousewheel.js is in repo.. Help welcome. I will maybe look at this later after sleeping.. Firefox console shows this message:\n\nThis site appears to use a scroll-linked positioning effect. This may not work well with asynchronous panning; see https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Performance/ScrollLinkedEffects for further details and to join the discussion on related tools and features!. Yes, it seems that I messed up jquery.mousewheel.js, by trying to include it locally. When I reverted my changes, mousewheel works on card. I'll look how this could be done correctly.. And now I also duplicated this, it seems that it tries to load file from cdn always. When I had Wekan install at localhost, disconnected internet, mousewheel does not scroll on card.. Hi,\nfor more examples, see:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings\n\nOn docker-compose.yml you need to have for http://localhost:3001 testing:\nenvironment:\n      - ROOT_URL=http://localhost:3001\n    ports:\n      # Docker outsideport:insideport\n      - 3001:8080\nFor http://localhost/wekan testing:\nenvironment:\n      - ROOT_URL=http://localhost/wekan\n    ports:\n      # Docker outsideport:insideport\n      - 80:8080\nFor production you ned to have:\nenvironment:\n      - ROOT_URL=https://example.com/wekan\n    ports:\n      # Docker outsideport:insideport\n      - 3001:8080\nBut, although sub-url could work, it could have problems with favcons, avatar icons #1776 etc, so I usually deploy Wekan to subdomain, for example:\nenvironment:\n      - ROOT_URL=https://boards.example.com\n    ports:\n      # Docker outsideport:insideport\n      - 3001:8080\nI will fix that #1776 sometime.. @HolgerGH \nI modified your feature request above to include images directly. Next time, please add images to GitHub issue directly, because 3rd party image hosting services are not reliable enough.. Did you try to build Wekan from source on Windows directly? I do not know does that work. You need correctly installed fibers etc.\nOr is this with Docker? Docker updates do not work, updating switches to Windows Docker containers. You need to backup (info at Wekan GitHub wiki, although I don't know what file paths Docker on Windows uses), remove Docker and containers, reinstall Docker and make sure you use Linux containers. Then use docker-compose to run Wekan again.. Current versions can be seen at Dockerfile\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/Dockerfile#L79-L83\nSo currently it's node 8.14.1 and latest npm.. @nerminator\nWekan has lowest RAM/CPU consumption on Windows when installing to Win10:\n1) Windows Subsystem for Linux\n2) Ubuntu for Windows from Windows Store\n3) Using rebuild-wekan.sh 1 and 2, start-wekan.sh from https://github.com/wekan/wekan and MongoDB 3.2.21 from MongoDB website.\nThat way fibers etc works.. I'm unable to fix fibers on Windows, I'm not fibers or Windows developer.\nWhen I some years ago tried to make Windows Service, Windows file permissions did lock me out of using files.\nOnce I tried to install Nim programming language to Windows, and then Windows Defender deleted it.\nSo I failed as Windows developer, and I'm unable to make Wekan working on Windows Source install. I can not fix this. This would require some Windows developer to get it working.. @therampagerado \nIf user moves list to archive, list goes to archive.\nIf user really goes to submenu to delete list, it is really deleted and cards too, it does not go to archive. That's the point why first visible is move to arhive, and only in submenu is delete. Delete list was moved to submenu because users too easily deleted list with important data. In that case, you get the data from your backups.\nBut, from your issue I get the impression that user should not be able to delete anything.. That wekan/wekan-mongodb is deprecated, it's not updated anymore.\nNewest docker-compose.yml is here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/docker-compose.yml\nHere is info about adding users:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Adding-users. Sure it's possible to rescue data from Wekan grains:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-from-Wekan-Sandstorm-grain-.zip-file\nI could try to figure out the reason why it got broken, if you are able to send me Wekan grain .zip file to my email address x@xet7.org. Ok I did get grain FL.zip file for testing.\nIn that file is FL/data/wiredTigerDb/mongodb.log , that shows unclean shutdown, maybe server was forcefully powered off?\n```\n2018-12-23T09:23:59.456+0000

\n***aborting after fassert() failure\n```\nIn that FL/data/wiredTigerDb directory is many files with .wt extension, like collection.wt and index.wt. Those are using MongoDB wiredtiger format with snappy compression.\nI did find webpage about how to salvage data from .wt files. That webpage has info about compiling in Windows with Windows port of snappy, but I only tried building in Linux:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/30974345/salvage-data-from-corrupted-mongodb\nBut problem when building wt executeable is that I don't seem to get snappy compression included correctly.\nFor dependencies I tried to install on Ubuntu 18.04 and Mint 19.1:\nsudo apt-get install git autoconf automake libtool cmake \\\nwiredtiger libwiredtiger-dev libwiredtiger0 libsnappy-dev libsnappy1v5 \\\npython3-snappy scons\nNote that this info about building under centos 7 does not work, because there is not new enough dependencies:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/367458/cannot-compile-wiredtiger-with-snappy-support-under-rhel\nSome info about building wiredtiger is here:\nhttp://source.wiredtiger.com/3.1.0/build-posix.html\nhttps://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger.git\nSnappy is here:\nhttps://google.github.io/snappy/\nhttps://github.com/google/snappy.git\nSome info about snappy here:\nhttps://source.wiredtiger.com/2.4.1/compression.html\nSCons is here:\nhttps://scons.org\nhttps://github.com/SCons/scons.git\nFor repair, I'm trying to use this repair.shbash script loop for *.wt files:\nfor f in *.wt; do\n    /home/user/repos/wiredtiger/wt salvage $f\n    # do some stuff here with \"$f\"\n    # remember to quote it or spaces may misbehave\ndone\nSo currently I get these errors for every .wt file when running repair.sh script:\nwt: session.salvage: file:collection-23--1899969267878664860.wt: Invalid argument\n[1545765004:811768][14186:0x7f1a2cff7140], file:collection-25--1899969267878664860.wt, WT_SESSION.salvage: unknown compressor 'snappy': Invalid argument\nSome wiredtiger snappy build instructions are also here, but I got some errors when running those commands:\nhttps://github.com/wiredtiger/rocksdb/wiki/WiredTiger-Build\nIt's not possible to use MongoDB repairDatabase command, because when I did copy raw MongoDB database files to snap or MongoDB website's package-installed MongoDB 3.2.21 then MongoDB database did not start at all, I presume that this is because of file corruption:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/repairDatabase/\nIt's not possible to use MongoDB bsondump command, because most important files are not in .bson file format, but instead are in .wt wiredtiger file format:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/bsondump/\nFor getting some of the data back, it is possible to search for strings in those collection.wt files, with command like:\ncat collection*.wt >> combined.bin\nstrings combined.bin > combined.txt\nAnother way is to look at those files with GUI hex editor like ghex:\nsudo apt-get install ghex\nghex\nand open one of those collection.wt files.\nCurrently Wekan supports MongoDB for storing data. It's also possible on Standalone Wekan to mirror data to PostgreSQL or in future also to MySQL. At Sandstorm file format currently is MongoDB. There is issue about other databases at #787 but I have not tried implementing other database support yet. Most crash-proof would most likely by SQLite.. For building, this did not include snappy:\n./autogen.sh\n./configure --enable-snappy\nmake. I found article about recovering MongoDB data, I'll try that:\nhttp://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/02/10/recovering-a-wiredtiger-collection-from-a-corrupt-mongodb-installation/. What is the problem? Was user account not created?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Adding-users. Is this new clean install?\nI would recommend that you backup, if any docker containers have important data:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup\nAnd cleanup #985 \nAnd try installing again.. I made some fixes.\n1) Cleanup\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/docker-cleanup-volumes\ncd docker-cleanup-volumes\n./start.sh\n2) Get newest docker-compose.yml\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wekan/wekan/devel/docker-compose.yml\nEdit for ROOT-URL etc if required and then:\ndocker-compose up -d\nAnd then restore backup if needed:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup. Upgrade to Wekan v1.96 with:\nsudo snap refresh\nor wait when it's automatically upgraded.. @ashgoodman \nWhen I move cards from board B to board A, both boards still load correctly.\nI tested this with existing Wekan boards in snap, and new Wekan v1.96 snap install.\nPlease give more details:\n- Are both boards normal boards?\n- Or is some of them subtask board?\n- Is this upgraded from old Wekan install, or new Wekan install?\n- Does cards you moved have subtasks or custom fields?\n. @rlach \nYes 2nd option would be safest. You can submit PR.. Hmm, probably I'll look at this sometime.. @Azbests  \n1) Do you have ROOT_URL etc settings setup correctly?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nsudo snap get wekan\n2) Do you have backups?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Backup-and-restore\n. I do have a lot of boards in my own Wekan install and it did upgrade to Wekan v1.97 just fine.. @Azbests \nSnap version updates automatically. That's the whole point of using snap.\nThose that want to upgrade manually can use Docker.\nIn v1.97 I did upgrade to node 8.15.0 and MongoDB 3.2.22:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v197-2018-12-26-wekan-release\nI don't know is trying to repair MongoDB useful in any way, and does it work. I tried it at #2070 where if MongoDB does not start, I did not get even raw database repair tools compiled correctly yet.\nCurrently Wekan is made with www.meteor.com Javascript web framework, that supports MongoDB. Wekan does not support using other databases as main database.\nUnrelated to this, sometime I also tried to repair corrupted MySQL databases, and that was also not possible. There is also https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Corruption page about corruption in PostgreSQL.\nAFAIK currently SQLite is most resistant to database corruption https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html\nI'm thinking what to do about these corruption issues. Suggestions welcome.. One option would be to try to change from MongoDB to FoundationDB:\nhttps://www.foundationdb.org/blog/announcing-document-layer/. Here is video about FoundationDB fault tolerance:\nhttps://www.geekwire.com/2018/foundationdb-interesting-nosql-database-owned-apple-now-open-source-project/\nBut I don't know yet how this would work in single-database use like in Snap and Sandstorm.. I found article about recovering MongoDB data, I'll try that:\nhttp://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/02/10/recovering-a-wiredtiger-collection-from-a-corrupt-mongodb-installation/. It is possible to repair MongoDB database this way:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-from-Wekan-Sandstorm-grain-.zip-file\nIf you have problems repairing, please open issue again and add comment.. I presume you did not add /slack to end of your webhook URL.\nFor example, when in Discord channel settings you add webhook\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/...\nYou need to add /slack to the end of URL, to tell that webhook format is slack:\nhttps://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/.../slack\nAnd after that add that /slack including URL to Wekan board, and then make changes to board.\nThis is already documented here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Outgoing-Webhook-to-Discord\nWorks for me.. I'm trying to find how to duplicate that non-editable bug.\n. I did read your issue, sorry I did not write clearly enough. I'll try again.\nWekan uses this type of JSON when sending to Outgoing Webhook:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Webhook-data\nDiscord supports incoming webhooks in different formats, like GitHub, Slack, etc. The incoming format needs to be specified by adding webhook format to end of URL.\nhttps://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-slackcompatible-webhook\nWekan generated webhooks are Slack compatible. Discord does not know anything about Wekan, Rocket.Chat, and other apps that produce Slack compatible Outgoing Webhook format. But using any other format like GitHub etc does not work, because Wekan Outgoing Webhooks are not in that format.\nWhen making Wekan Outgoing Webhook to Rocket.Chat and Slack, there is no need to add anything to Webhook URL when those that is added to Wekan board. Discord in this case has decided to implement multiple Incoming Webhook formats and require specifying format in URL.. @Morpheusxeno \nDid you get Wekan Outgoing Webhook to Discord working?. Please add comment to this issue, if you still have problems.\nClosing issue.. @BrianD91 \nI presume with options compass you mean drag handles #1772 that was implemented at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2067 in Wekan v1.95.\nThey currently work only on mobile webbrowser this way:\n- It's possible to use finger to move board around\n- When long pressing drag handle it's possible to move card\nCurrently on dektop browser:\n- Drag handles are visible when webbrowser window is made small enough\n- It's not possible to move board with mouse by dragging non-handle part, like it's possible by using finger on mobile browser.\n@hupptechnologies \nIs it possible that you could implement drag handles, long press and moving around with mouse pointer also for desktop? So that drag handles would be always visible? I tried to implement it, but I did not get moving with mouse pointer working yet.. @BrianD91 \nIf you don't have your ROOT_URL correctly set, you can not even open card and all kinds of stuff is broken.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings. @Schwuppweg \nCan you send that broken Wekan Sandstorm grain .zip file to my email address x@xet7.org so I can try to fix it ?. I have sent you repaired MongoDB database dump, that I made this way:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-from-Wekan-Sandstorm-grain-.zip-file\nSo you can restore it to Standalone Wekan like Snap or Docker.\nI will later create tool to make Sandstorm grain .zip file, or another way to import to Sandstorm.\nMoved  #1695. Moved to #1969. Moved to #1969. Translations are done at Transifex, please add them there:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan\nOnly English wekan/i18n/en.i18n.json source language is done as pull request when adding new features.. Yes, because that was removed in Wekan v1.96 because login did not work at all #2072:\n- Revert \"Improve authentication\" and \"Default Authentication Method\" to make login work again.\nBut now that I noticed updated comment from #2072 , so maybe if email login could be fixed, it could be included again:\nUpdate: actually can sign in using username/password method, but e-mail/password method is affected\nsnap logs wekan.wekan shows:\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]:     at Meteor.EnvironmentVariable.EVp.withValue (packages/meteor.js:1186:15)\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]:     at Object._failIfArgumentsAreNotAllChecked (packages/check.js:127:41)\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]:     at maybeAuditArgumentChecks (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:1765:18)\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]:     at DDP._CurrentPublicationInvocation.withValue (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:1043:15)\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]:     at Meteor.EnvironmentVariable.EVp.withValue (packages/meteor.js:1186:15)\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]:     at Subscription._runHandler (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:1041:51)\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]:     at Session._startSubscription (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:859:9)\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]:     at Session.sub (packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:625:12)\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]:     at packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js:559:43\n2018-12-24T12:31:29Z wekan.wekan[5665]: Sanitized and reported to the client as: Match failed [400]. Dropdown can be hidden at Admin Panel / Layout.. @TiibCD \nYou can do translations for languages you know at:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan\nI have done English, copied that to en-GB, and done Finnish.\nI have notified translators that there are new string to translate, so some are already in progress.\nWhen adding features to Wekan, I don't wait for all translations. When I do Wekan releases nearly daily, I do include newest translated strings from Transifex.. @Angtrim is currently looking into fixing this.. I think after creating you can update card by adding receivedAt etc\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API-Cards#update-a-card. Doh. Someone could add pull request for that, it's similar code like other lines there. I need to go to sleep soon.. @hupptechnologies \nCan you look at this?. I tested with newest Wekan, this is already fixed.. 1. Reorder attachments: in what way it should be possible?. That is outdated page\nThere is at github.com/wekan/wekan script rebuild-wekan.sh that when selected 1) will install dependencies and 2) will build wekan, although it can have bugs too\nand fixed paths etc. I think actually installing without root is not possible yet.\nThere is in progress making Wekan build with just running command meteor, so there will be simpler scripts.\nSorry about all the mess. I welcome all new contributors.. Works for me on Firefox and Chrome. Wekan does not have any files size limitations. Most likely you have some webserver like Nginx configure wrong in front of Wekan, and Nginx adds file size limitations.\nIn related note, Trello free version has attachment size limitations.. It's not requirement to change from Snap to Docker, if you can wait. Snap still uses Meteor 1.6, that is slower, because I did not get node connecting to MongoDB correctly. There is fix that one Wekan contributor is working on, so that Snap will have faster Meteor 1.8 and MongoDB 4.x. Also, using MongoDB 4.x will make possible to change MongoDB queries to new aggregate queries using features new MongoDB 4.x provides, so this will make Wekan faster. Adding these changes is currently in progress by one Wekan contributor.\nIf you are in a hurry, for Docker, there is available newer Meteor 1.8 version of Wekan with using MongoDB 4.x, by using image:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8\nThis meteor 1.8 version should also work with AWS ECS container service and new AWS MongoDB 3.6 compatible scalable database. So you could add ECS cluster to use MongoDB.. @TiibCD \nResource usage difference is mostly visible only on Windows when using Docker vs Linux Subsystem for Windows. Wekan works best on Linux and there I presume it's hard to notice any resource usage difference of source vs Docker.. @Akuket has done only LDAP changes, so this issue not for him. He is mostly busy with his work, most likely I will add his login improvements back.\nSome info about Meteor 1.8 is here. For newer modern browsers the bundle of javascript/css/html is much smaller. \nhttps://blog.meteor.com/meteor-1-8-erases-the-debts-of-1-7-77af4c931fe3\nInfo about aggregate queries is here, they have not been added to Wekan yet, but using them will make Wekan faster:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/\nThere is no benchmarks yet specifically for Wekan yet. It's experience of one Wekan contributor that has upgraded other Meteor apps to Meteor 1.8.\nThere is ongoing issue about Meteor performance here. There has been some fixes to Node.js with Node 8.12, but getting fibers working correctly and making more performance improvements for meteor is still on-going process that is being debugged and fixed in newer meteor versions:\nhttps://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9796\nSome more info about various performance improvement options are here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Debugging\nIn general, Wekan has not been optimized fully yet. Rocket.Chat has same Meteor stack as Wekan does, and Rocket.Chat does not have problems with large amount of users.\nFor Wekan Snap Meteor 1.8 upgrades, required fix has already made by one Wekan contributor to other Meteor projects.\nThe way to help Wekan in general is to:\n- help with adding feature requests and bug reports\n- adding pull requests to fix any issues, looking at wiki developer docs. Many fixes have been done by beginners.\n- using my commercial support https://wekan.team for features and bugfixes I plan to do for many years, so I can pay my bills\n- adding bounties to issues as described at https://wekan.team\n- help with documenting Wekan https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki by directly editing wiki text, and adding attachment images and animgifs as PRs to https://github.com/wekan/wekan.github.io\nWith more contributors, Wekan would have faster progress. Wekan is community effort.. @bentiss\nCurrently Wekan loads too much html/css/js/data at first time. For example, translations for all languages are loaded, and when importing big boards from Trello and using them in Wekan, Wekan gets very slow, because there is too much data in browserside minimongo. Would it be possible to load only necessary data, for example only in-use translations, and only load data of those cards that are visible, with some infinite load/scroll code? And also, if currently Archived items are not visible, they also would not be loaded to browser.\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/?q=infinite. Also, currently importing Trello/Wekan board happens with copy-paste to browser form, at foreground. It would be better to do imports etc bigger things in background for example with https://atmospherejs.com/msavin/sjobs. and just upload JSON file first to MongoDB.. Related:\nInfinite scrolling at https://github.com/rcdexta/react-trello. @bentiss \nNo, I'm not sure about internationalization, I have not done profiling.\nIt would be nice if processing of hidden cards could be prevented.\nYou could add your openshift changes to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/edge/openshift. Related https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/issues/2#issuecomment-378343587. @GuiGuiSoft \nIf you are running at AWS, one option is to use AWS DocumentDB:\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/\nBecause AWS DocumentDB is compatible with MongoDB 3.6, it requires using Wekan Meteor 1.8 version, that is at this Docket Image tag:\nimage: quay.io/wekan/wekan:meteor-1.8\nBut I have not tested yet how DocumentDB works.\nFor Azure, there is Azure CosmosDB:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-introduction\nI did not check what MongoDB version Cosmos supports.. @GuiGuiSoft \nWell, in that case, if MongoDB is bottleneck, you could add more CPU to MongoDB VM.. @GuiGuiSoft \nBut if Wekan is fast enough, I think no more is necessary.. @rjevnikar @GuiGuiSoft @bentiss @TiibCD @GavinLilly \nNewest Wekan has 10x lower resource usage, so it's much faster, but is it fast enough for you? Please test.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/3c49e2d0edec19eff4f87b0fcc127f924af193fc#commitcomment-32537953. Use drag handle arrow-cross to drag. On mobile, other areas of card can be used to move page up and down.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1772\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2067\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v195-2018-12-21-wekan-release\nUpcoming:\nDrag handles for lists in mobile:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/2098\nDrag handles and long press for desktop webbrowser\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/2081\n. @ajRiverav \nYou need to click on webbrowser reload Wekan webpage so that cards are draggable again in original width.\nSometime when cross-arrow is implemented for full width, dragging with cross-arrow works all the time.. Urlencode special characers, see top of this page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Troubleshooting-Mail. You should only urlencode username and password. Not any other characters like : etc. smtp://a%40b.com:pd%40@192.168.100.1:25/?ignoreTLS=true&tls={rejectUnauthorized:false}&secure=false\nso you urlencode only @ that is special character in username or password. What SMTP server are you trying to use?. Maybe it does not have non-encrypted port 25 sending at all. So it would require TLS.. Are you using Wekan source/Snap/Docker/Sandstorm version?. Use the authMethod option to select a different method if your server does not support PLAIN. See the docs here\nI found this comment from:\nhttps://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/issues/832#issuecomment-358258315. You could also google search for \"smtp invalid login 502 AUTH PLAIN\" for other ways to fix it. If you find something that works, please add comment to this issue.. @voicyfei \nDoes your IBM notes server have SMTP sending enabled?\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45458885/how-to-send-mail-from-ibm-lotus-notes-using-nodemailer. That duplicate menu was removed, I updated features page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#member-setting-when-clicking-your-username-on-top-right-corner\n. @andyprv \nDo you mean that all boards should send webhook data to that URL ?. Doh, now that I read your feature request again, yes, you did mention all boards. Ok.. I was thinking about board-specific role color #1861\nBut it seems you would mean card-specific role color. Hmm, I need to think.. @HolgerGH \nMaybe having roles colored is not so important.\nWhat if it would be possible for each card, set for each avatar 1) color and 2) tooltip addtitional text like \"Fullname - Tooltiptext\" that would be for example \"Joe Normal - The Boss\" ?\nWhat do you think?. Yes having it card specific is more general.. @Lacour20 \nWekan does not yet save data about all changes, so that needs to be added first as optional feature, because it grows size of database much faster.. @Lacour20 \nWhat should it look like? Please add screenshot mockup, so I can think what is possible.. @Lacour20 \nScreenshot of Trello changes or screenshot mockup of wekan, as comment to this issue, with image attachment.. Hmm, I'm trying to think while drinking coffee. Maybe:\n1) When something like card change is added to activities\n2) Colored hint is added to card for each board user\n3)  When each user clicks on card, colored hint is removed\nAnd maybe this setting would be\na) user-specific setting to enable\nb) board-specific setting to enable\nc) Admin Panel global setting to enable\nWhat do you think?. Maybe this could be like user-specific subscriptions, like there is for getting changes in email?\nSo each user could select what notifications they want to subscribe with email / browser notification / hint on card / etc? And user would select which activities to subscribe to and how?. @saurabharch \nWhat do you think? I think this is related to #2026 . @rjevnikar \nDo you have time to try to fix this and #2202 ?. Fixed already in Wekan release.. @bentiss \nIn Card Hamburder Menu / Set Color / Select Color dropdown, add those colors as background of each color name, so there is preview what color looks like.. Hmm, I think you can add colors to dropdown in another PR. This seems to work anyway.. @bentiss \nI'm currently looking at changing IFTTT Rules color names to colors.. @bentiss \nYou can do git pull on edge branch. I did change IFTTT Rules dropdown colors to translated text with dropdown having both text and color. But maybe that dropdown button itself could have color applied also, that way text would not need to be there.\nWhat do you think?. @bentiss \n\nHaving some feedback on the chosen color would be nice, indeed. Maybe we can just use the color picker in the IFTTT case too, and make the button changing color depending on the selected color.\n\nThat would be nice. Can you try to get it working?. @therampagerado \nYou can set at what time Wekan etc snap packages are updated:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install#5-install-all-snap-updates-automatically-between-0200am-and-0400am\nFor example:\nsnap set core refresh.schedule=02:00-04:00\nSo set that to your nighttime.\nIf you want to update manually, then you change from Snap version to Docker version. See Wekan GitHub wiki Backup page for import/export info.. How this is visible to you? Can you add screenshot? Maybe I did build Wekan wrong and did not see change correctly.\nFor me it seems the change is that you removed unset card color button, and replaced it with white color. I think unset card color button was better.\nI tried to ask is it possible that in Rules wizard, where is dropdown of colors with color names, can it be replaced with similar palette of colors as in card Set Color, so that colors would also work in Firefox. But I don't know is it possible.  Another possibility would be to look is it possible to get some compatible color code that would show in Firefox.. Sorry, Caddy webserver has errors about Let's Encrypt rate limits. I will try to do some workaround.. Now it works, there is workaround, by using CloudFlare. I try to get Let's Encrypt working later.. > This was a bug I had when I created a bunch of Lists and Swimlanes from the API: it was not possible to reorder them (sort being null).\n\nWe should probably do the same for the Cards inside a list.\n\nYes.\n\nI would think instead of having the plus sign to add a new swimlane, it would be better to have 2 entries in the hamburger menu: Insert a Swimlane above and Insert a Swimlane below\n\nNo, that would mean extra clicks and longer texts in hamburger menu. Current + adds Swimlane below and it can be dragged up/down if needed.\n\nIn the small display view (phone), maybe we should keep the swimlane vertical on the left.\n\nI have not tested yet. Somehow Swimlanes should be usable on mobile view.\n\nStill not sure about how the per-list color would render\n\nPer-list color is background color of the List title  +\u2630 first line, without second line of count of cards. . > I would think instead of having the plus sign to add a new swimlane, it would be better to have 2 entries in the hamburger menu: Insert a Swimlane above and Insert a Swimlane below\nActually, on swimlane where is + can instead be 2 buttons +^ for up (font awesome arrow up) and +v (font awesome arrow down).. Yes.. Ok. What are the possibilities to make lists and cards more beautiful? For example, having only list/card borders colored? Or having them transparent? Is there some example in previous screenshot you added? For example, here in GitHub comments title has grey background, write area is white, and text is black?. That's nice! What if card color is also a line at bottom of the card?\nThis also makes me think of different line style selections like dotted line, but I don't know is it a good idea at all.. Only Admin user can use REST API with username and password of Admin user. Passwords are stored encrypted on Wekan database. I would presume that you would only create users that have some other role like Normal/No Comments/Comment Only, like described at Wekan GitHub Wiki REST API Roles page.\nAdding feature like using some API KEY instead of username would most likely not make any difference, because it still has access to everything, including changing passwords.\nIf you have some other webserver like Nginx/Apache/Caddy in front of wekan, you can add additional restrictions to /api path, like allowing only from some IP addresses, or denying that address completely and accessing /api path through VPN.\nIf you use PHP to access API then you can have Ioncube PHP Encoder to obfuscate PHP source code where is your Admin user username and password.\nIs this enough for you? Or how should it work?. Sure you can also use MongoDB database directly too, changes will be applied immediately to Wekan, but it's not recommended, because database schema can change.. No problem, I did merge everything. Thanks!. @bentiss \nActually, I think it's better to add option buttons with arrows to current current one popup, and not change anything else:\nAdd a Swimlane [X] v [_] ^. @ShuiHuo \nYou have old Wekan version. Please try newest Wekan v2.04 that was released today, where vertical swimlane title has been changed to horizontal.. @bentiss \nCan you look at this?. I found the reason.\nBugfix for Firefox rendering issue did hide scrollbar. After removing that, on Chromium/Chrome scrollbar works OK, but on Firefox cards are below of swimlane. Well, it's better to have them working on Chromium/Chrome than not at all.\nI don't think it's good to go back to vertical swimlane, because changing it to horizontal swimlane did fix #2133 \nI will make new release with this partial fix.. @n0n0n0n0\nIf you don't want to include all data of webhook, you can leave some of them out, like described at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Supported-settings-keys\nwebhooks-attributes: What to send to Outgoing Webhook, or leave out.\n                 Example, that includes all that are default: \n                 cardId,listId,oldListId,boardId,comment,user,card,commentId .\n                 To enable the Webhooks Attributes of Wekan:\n                 snap set wekan webhooks-attributes=cardId,listId,oldListId,boardId,comment,user,card,commentId\n                 Disable the Webhooks Attributest of Wekan to send all default ones:\n                 snap set wekan webhooks-attributes=''\nFor example, sending only comments and users to webhook:\nSnap\nsudo snap set wekan webhooks-attributes='comment,user'\ndocker-compose.yml\nexport WEBHOOKS_ATTRIBUTES=comment,user\nSource start-wekan.sh\nexport WEBHOOKS_ATTRIBUTES=comment,user. What browser and browser version?. This is fixed in Wekan v2.08 that is now in progress of being released now.. Moved to #2179. I made that card below swimlane fix Firefox-only but seems that it made left-right scroll not work. I'll try to to make that fix up-down only.. @mueschel \nWhat Firefox version? On my Firefox v64 when there is added so many cards or lists that they don't fit into screen, scrollbars appear.. @mueschel \nFirefox 64 has these changes:\nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/64.0/releasenotes/\nIncluding these security fixes:\nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2018-29/\nI have no idea why I should support old Firefox version.. I presume someone from those companies will send pull request to fix that bug.\nCurrently I'm busy with other work.. @bentiss \nDo you have time to look at this? I think this would require detecting Firefox ESR version or using some feature detection, and then setting overflow in such way it would work.. Try does it accept markdown?\n[Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html). You could try to use some markdown or HTML to make text smaller. There are some markdown examples at screenshot at top of webpage https://wekan.github.io .. @pantraining\nWhat version of Wekan you have?. Ok. @bentiss \nIn Lists and Swimlane mode, when I'm writing text to minicard, pressing Enter duplicates the same text to next card.\nPressing Enter should add card below, and go to card below, without duplicating text.\nPressing Shift-Enter should go to next line on current card.. Yes repair info is somewhere here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-from-Wekan-Sandstorm-grain-.zip-file. For Docker here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/issues/6#issuecomment-424004116. These links are from Wekan GitHub wiki menu / Repair. Also look where your database files are like /var/lib/docker/... so you have not started some new container without data. Also at Wekan GitHub wiki see backup page, I recommend making backups at least once per day.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Archive-and-Delete. You can upgrade Wekan Docker version this way, with default docker-compose.yml from https://github.com/wekan/wekan\ndocker stop wekan-app\ndocker rm wekan-app\ndocker-compose up -d\nYou see your salleman PR changes this way:\ndocker exec -it wekan-app bash\ncat /build/programs/server/packages/*salle* | grep endpoints\nAnd this will show your comment line you added:\n// Some userinfo endpoints use a different base URL than the authorization or token endpoints.\nI did test this a moment ago.\nBoth Quay and Docker Hub containers build automatically after each change. Quay builds containers faster than Docker Hub. Quay builds can be seen at https://quay.io/wekan/wekan .. @danpatdav \nHere is how LDAP maps fields set in environment variables to Wekan users:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap/blob/master/server/loginHandler.js. @danpatdav \nLet's continue discussion here, where Keycloak is in progress:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1874#issuecomment-459818460. Did you limit amount of RAM available in Docker container? If Wekan or MongoDB does not get enough RAM, Yes it will crash.\n. And please upgrade to newest Wekan.. @rjevnikar \nNo, there does not need to be any limits.\nDid you use docker-compose.yml from wekan/wekan repo? Or how did you start Wekan ?. Have you installed all updates to CentOS 7, Docker and docker-compose?\nWhat versions of Docker and docker-compose are you using?. Please test does newest Wekan crash too.. Newest Docker is 18.09.1, please upgrade:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/. There are some errors about Subtasks not defined. This could be because of current Subtasks bugs, that you can find from Wekan GitHub open issues. For example, if some card is moved away from Subtasks, it could cause Wekan board not loading. Fixing Subtasks bugs would make Wekan work again.\nAnother, but worse option is to delete Subtasks from database.\nStop wekan-app container:\ndocker stop wekan-app\nThen connect to MongoDB container\ndocker start wekan-db\ndocker exec -it wekan-db bash\nmongo\nuse wekan\nshow collections\nEtc.. There are also error messages about hugepages, but I don't know does it help at all to disable or enable them:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/transparent-huge-pages/\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1309438/how-to-enable-huge-page-support-in-a-dockerfile. I did begin to test Kadira, but did not finish setting it up completely. At that time I did add links to Kadira here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Debugging\nThere is no actual Kadira integration yet in Wekan.\nAbout performance, latest Wekan v2.13 that was released today loads only visible cards with infinite scrolling code, so it could help with big Wekan boards, and maybe also with performance, but I don't know yet, because I have not yet done testing with big boards.. @GavinLilly \nCan you see from webbrowser inspect where in code that TypeError is? For example, some lines of code from above to below so the same could be found from source code, with some keyword search, like using script find.sh that is at https://github.com/wekan/wekan , and using it to find same code from kadira repo recursively.. @GavinLilly \nHow did you setup Kadira? I would like to also try it on my server.. From GitHub network it seems that newest maintained repo is here:\nhttps://github.com/meteor/meteor-apm-agent. Please fix lint errors, remove console.log statements, etc, like this:\nsudo npm -g install eslint\ncd wekan\nnpm run lint\neslint --fix client/components/...js\nI tried to do that myself, but got problems with that async function.. There is now new branch feature-improve-authentication where other lint fixes already are, only that async missing:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/feature-improve-authentication\nYou can add your PR to that branch.. Original author added 6 board colors. Nobody has added more colors to boards yet. There are some other color settings for Swimlane/List/Card etc where is more colors.\n@bentiss Can you look at this?. Actually, someone could look are there some more board etc colors at Trello that are not imported yet, and add those colors to Wekan too. . @gerroon \nThis issue does not have bounty (info about bounties) so it is backlogged.. @bentiss \nCan you look at this?. @therampagerado \nJust guessing, this could be related to #2159 , so please wait until it is fixed.. @rterwedo \nYes there is interest, you can add bounty of $350 to\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/69626180-feature-request-swimlane-templates\nThis feature does not exist in Wekan yet.. @andresmanelli is currently working on this.. @andresmanelli \n\n\nMerge latest commits from upstream wekan edge\n\n\nFix lint errors:\nsudo npm -g install eslint\ncd wekan\nnpm run lint\neslint --fix filename\nand if something is not automatically fixed, do some web searches how to fix it.. @andresmanelli \n\n\nWith my existing Wekan boards, after fixing lint errors, All Boards page has only Add board button etc, but no boards listed at all. So I can only change to those boards that have shortcuts.. @andresmanelli \nYes I can try. Please add migrations.. @andresmanelli \nIn mobile view, that you see by making browser window less wide, Card/List/Swimlane templates duplicated so that for example Cards templates lists all Card/List/Swimlane templates, etc.. @andresmanelli \nI merged your changes to Wekan edge branch and added Finnish translation.\nAt templates board words Templates/Card/Swimlane/Board Templates are not translated. Although, it is good that it's possible to change name of board Templates. I would think that if Templates and Welcome board has default texts, if user language is different, those text could be translated to different language.\n\n. @andresmanelli \nYou can merge latest changes from Wekan edge branch to your edge branch.\nWhen I add new template boards to Templates, click linked template board, then in Lists mode I can not add new List, Enter and Save button of list name does not work. It's only possible to modify template board after changing from Lists mode to Swimlanes mode.\n\n. @andresmanelli \nAfter above, Lists view is always empty on Welcome board and other boards. This also make public boards show empty, because public boards show only List view. When logged in, if I try to add new lists, it does not show in Lists mode, but they are created anyway and are visible in Swimlanes mode.\nAlso, I'm thinking, that maybe it's better that there would be no Welcome board at all. That way it would not need to be translated. Most users import or create custom board anyway. It should just be possible to create new board (or import), and have default swimlane.\nIt would also be good to fix #1959 so that when default swimlane is deleted, it would be possible to create new swimlane anyway.. @andresmanelli \nYes labels etc should be copied.\nIs there some way to copy existing board/list/card to template?. @andresmanelli \nWould it be possible to export/import cards/lists/swimlanes as JSON ? It would help a lot. Although I don't know would it be out of scope. There is some open issues about those already.. @andresmanelli \nOk.\nAlso, @Angtrim has coded some of Duplicate Board feature #2100 and currently is looking about some related import/export fixed, but there is no PR about that yet. I don't know are these someway related to templates.. @andresmanelli \nYes you can chat with @Angtrim at Vanila Chat. That Duplicate Board code is something that was possible to do because of all the work @Angtrim did with IFTTT Rules.. @rterwedo \nWekan v2.29 is now released, it includes current version of Templates feature. Please test.\n@andresmanelli will add remaining TODO items later.. @rterwedo \nYes Docker image is updated, v2.29 and latest tags are here:\nhttps://quay.io/repository/wekan/wekan?tag=latest&tab=tags\nI did test that templates do work, it's possible to add templates and insert those.\nI will close this issue now and move remaining to new issue, they will be fixed by @andresmanelli . I will also give info to @andresmanelli how to claim bounty.. I guess this is because at Sandstorm Wekan does not use username/password, because Sandstorm provides SSO to all apps and in Wekan is only Sandstorm user ID. User collection/table structure is different in Standalone vs Sandstorm Wekan. This can be seen when exporting Sandstorm grain .zip to json files.\nI'll look is there any way to admin users using Sandstorm API in general.. Do you have Websockets enabled on your Nginx config?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Nginx-Webserver-Config. Well, there is Outgoing Webhooks:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Outgoing-Webhook-to-Discord\nBut those do not currently have more specific details about card list/swimlane position, so that info would need to be added.. Most likely those dependencies need to be included to wekan/packages directory to make it work. I'll try.. Moved to #2165. For viewing JSON files, you can use for example:\nless wekan.json\nor look at bottom 200 lines of JSON file\ntail -200 wekan.json | less\nFor copying JSON to clipboard in Linux, it's possible to use xclip:\nsudo apt-get install xclip\ncat wekan.json | xclip -se c\nAnd then paste in to webbrowser. Before pasting, do close other apps that are running, so you have enough RAM available. If it still does not work, you could run webbrowser and Wekan on server using remote desktop like VNC, to some server where is enough RAM.\nSure, these are workarounds, but these could help while I have not added uploading as files yet.\nI have not checked does Wekan many any thumbnails from images that are visible at board. I don't know how much that would help using Wekan boards.. Also, if something needs search/replace in JSON file, you can use sed:\nsed -i 's|something-text|use-this-text-instead|g' wekan.json. Wekan loads only visible cards. When cards are scrolled, more cards are loaded from server on the fly. Without this newest fix previously it was not possible to load big Wekan board that has thousands of cards. That board was imported from Trello, and Wekan kept on loading all of it to browserside, hanging infinitely. The fix made loading board possible.\nIdeas and PRs welcome how to speed up this.. Adding that scrollbar did fix #1404 . What kind of text? Some of these?\nEmacs Org mode and Leo Literate Editor Import / Export\nImport / Export CSV. Structure:\n- Tree Organization nested structure with any names and number of levels, for example: Super Admin / Company Group / Company or Department / Organization / Team / User\n- For each level: Board Groups / Board / Swimlane / List / Card / Card name - Minicard text - Description text - Checklists - Attachments - Due etc Dates - Comments - etc\n- Include all environment settings as tree structure for each setting type, for example: Settings / LDAP / LDAP_ENABLED etc\n- At each level, it's possible import/export to current and below levels\n- Leo editor Clones => Wekan Linked Cards and Linked Boards etc\n- Import/Export everything in Wekan/Leo/Emacs Org mode format.\n- Save all as template, for creating new Organization Structure with all settings as Template in Tree Organization nested structure template menu where is currently Board Groups.. From @saurabharch \nVanila Community uses Spectrum that has GraphQL.\nWhy I am talking about graphql, and why it is necessary for wekan because we are dealing with data and availability.\nIn current status we didn\u2019t support local data storage at client side and even we didn\u2019t support single end point data interaction we have lot\u2019s of rest api request now, and client request trips are over and over that is why wekan takes time to load large dataset of wekan board.\nSpectrum use RethinkDB instead of mongoDB. Because RethinkDB provide direct push notifications service at subscribers. And stuff is full filled by Redis for serious data management from client side to server side.. @saurabharch\nBecause GraphQL is hierarchical, would GraphQL help with different hierarchical file formats like Emacs Org mode, Leo, Wekan JSON Import/Export, etc?. @TomasAxelsson\nThanks for adding feature request. I'm happy to help new Wekan contributors to get started in coding, answering any questions here at GitHub issues.\nCurrently Wekan is in use around the world in thousands of servers, as can be seen at https://snapcraft.io/wekan . That is only for snap version of Wekan, without Docker etc other platforms.\nIf some Wekan contributor has some free time to look at this, it's welcome. Otherwise I will look at this later when I'm implementing Wekan calendar sync to Friend calendar.\n. Moved to #641. You could look are there related settings at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/docker-compose.yml\nWekan LDAP code is at:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap\nWekan can be run behind Apache:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Apache\n@Akuket \nDo you know about this?. I presume it's not yet in Wekan, and would require adding code for checking that header at layouts.* at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/client/components/main login page and/or wekan/server/authentication.js and then based on that check it similarly with Javascript code and login user, with similar code like in that PHP extension. Anyway, that extension PHP code is not long, and everything required to login is already in Wekan LDAP code, so this would require just someone that has time to look at the code, figure it out and add PR.. Do you really have https for your IP address?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings. You have wrong internal port. Correct one currenctly is 8080. It was changed because of fix to OpenStack config.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/docker-compose.yml#L149\nMore normal config would be to have https://boards.example.com proxying to localhost Wekan, when Wekan would have these settings. Note that newes:\nports:\n- 8888:8080\n- ROOT_URL=https://boards.example.com\n. I would guess it's snappy, but if MongoDB has some commandline options for algorithms used you could add them to docker-compose.yml.. Oops, I should first check MongoDB commandline options before closing this.. Sorry, I'm not familiar with running Sandstorm on Fedora and Arch. My Sandstorm installs are usually on Ubuntu 18.04 64bit, and I have not had problems creating new Wekan boards. I recommend downloading your grains, installing Ubuntu 18.04 VM, and uploading grains.. Sure, you can add Sandstorm issue, if you have not yet done so:\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues. Moved to https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/3125. @MilovanovM \nPlease make new version of logo where grey shadow is removed, and add .zip file of .ai and .svg to comment of this issue by attaching files directly to issue, without using Dropbox. Thanks a lot !. @MilovanovM \nwekan-1_2.ai is missing from .zip file, please add it.. @MelBourbon \nWhen you ssh to Wekan server, what does this command show?\nsudo snap logs wekan.wekan. @MelBourbon \nCan you for a moment change your Wekan language to English, and take screenshots, add arrows to screenshots showing what you did to make this circular reference, and add those screenshots directly to attachments to this issue comment? Because I did not understand it well enough from your description above. Thanks!. @xarinatan \nMost likely fix would include be removing all circular references, so easiest would be for you to just wait it to be fixed. There has been many bugs fixes today by many Wekan contributors, those will be included in next release, but today there were not enough time to fix this bug yet.. @andresmanelli \nWhen I tried your circular changes, previous menu change and the new migration for fixing existing circulars that is not yet in Wekan release:\n- Migration to fix circular bug did work once to make opening card possible\n- After that, it was still possible to select card itself from menus to make circular bug happen again. This did make Standalone and Sandstorm Wekan to freeze, requiring Wekan/Sandstorm stop/start.\n- After that, trying to open card still made Wekan/Sandstorm freeze.\nI think fix would need to run every time at beginning of opening board.\nAnd try to hide option to select card itself.. @andresmanelli \nOk I will check, just a moment.. @andresmanelli \nThis is not fixed on Sandstorm. When I click circular bug card, Sandstorm freezes, and requires restart of Sandstorm.. @andresmanelli \nIt seems that on Sandstorm I am unable make new circular happen by selecting card itself, because card itself is not in menu.. @andresmanelli \nSo it seems that only remaining issue is that old circulars are not removed automatically.. @xarinatan \nThere will be renaming of migrations from @andresmanelli so that removing circular would work once more.. I would think this could be default behaviour.. I have added picture to Auth0 rule javascript code. That code is for getting avatar url from Auth0 login provider like Google or GitHub. I did also add limiting that rule to only Auth0 application name like WekanApplication so it does not break other Auth0 applications.\nTODO: Add to wekan environment variable setting OAUTH2_PICTURE_MAP and make it set Wekan avatar image.. @bsenicar \nSending mail from Sandstorm Wekan is not implemented yet, I would need to find some documentation how to send email from sandboxed Sandstorm grain.. Hmm, I think at Sandstorm it's not possible to change environment variables, so some settings would probably need to be added to Wekan Admin Panel.. @andresmanelli \nPlease test Wekan meteor-1.8 branch why it gives this error? That branch has meteor 1.8.0.2 and I used rebuild-wekan.sh without cloning repo https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core.git to wekan/packages/ directory.\n```\nException in template helper: TypeError: Cannot read property 'getTemplatesBoardSlug' of undefined. Currently there is problems that templates board disappeared. There should be:\n\n[ ] ability to manage template boards same way like other boards, adding and removing template boards\n[ ] selecting users that use have these template boards\n[ ] are templates visible to users\n[ ] are templates modifiable for that template users or not. @andresmanelli \n\nAfter some bug did make my templates board disappear, I think that there needs to be added new feature/fix, that every time when starting Wekan there should be check is there templates board, and if not, create it.. Related #2209. Moved to #2226. @Naelpuissant \n1) At Wekan board right click [<] button to show right sidebar, then click user avatar, and change user role to No Comments. Alternatively, automate creating many users by loggin in to REST API with code and create user with Wekan REST API and change role. This makes users to not see any activities and comments. This No Comments feauture is originally designed for customer user that should not see comments of expert team providing the service. But, there is not default user setting for this yet.\nThere is not yet setting for default set watch to tracking.\n2) Not yet, because Wekan does not have time scheduler yet. It will be added later.\nI have added these to Teams milestone, and I will look at implementing these during that.. @justinr1234 \nWould this be better?\n- When clicking current hamburger menu button, Members and Activities would open\n- Members and Activities sidebar would have at right top corner this Settings button https://fontawesome.com/icons/cog?style=solid\n- When clicking on Settings button, Wekan Boards Settings menu would open. @justinr1234 \nWhat do you think about this? I only changed icons:\n- hamburger to cog = Settings\n- arrow to hamburger = Sidebar\n\n. @justinr1234 \nOk, I combined menus this way, what do you think?\n1) Hamburger menu opens sidebar\n\n2) Cog icon opens Board Settings\n\n. Wekan v2.36 is now released, it includes this feature.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install\nor\nhttps://sandstorm.io/install. @Vertux \nYou can also install from source using rebuild-wekan.sh and start-wekan.sh scripts at https://github.com/wekan/wekan . I don't know what kind of package manager Plex has, does Plex have any app store similar to what Snap and Sandstorm have.. Moved to #2221. @Vertux \nSource install would mess up your server that has non-standard locations, so I do not recommend that.\nDocker Wekan can be installed easiest this way:\n- Wekan current stable version v2.35 is mentioned at https://wekan.github.io\n- 4000 is port exposed to localhost, you can change to other one\n- Nginx or Apache proxy to localhost:4000\n- ROOT_URL examples, below https://boards.example.com Nginx or Apache URL proxies to localhost Docker port 4000\n- there are also other settings that are documented here, below is only minimum required\n- Adding users\n```\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo:3.2.21\ndocker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link \"wekan-db:db\" -e \"MONGO_URL=mongodb://db\" -e \"ROOT_URL=https://boards.example.com\" -e \"WITH_API=true\" -p 4000:8080 quay.io/wekan/wekan:v2.35\n```. @soohwa @sfahrenholz \nI added you with write access to existing documentation repository https://github.com/wekan/wekanhow .\nPlease add documentation from other urls like soohwa's repos and Wekan GitHub wiki directly to new style of that wekanhow repo.

Making news docs and website is already in progress. Please contribute by sending PRs.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekanhow. @soohwa \nCool, keep it coming :+1: . Thanks for info! I will try to fix this.. Upgrade to Wekan v2.37 with sudo snap refresh. I'll try to reproduce this, is there same error on my Wekan install.. @andresmanelli \nTemplates board disappeared from newest Wekan, that is built from edge branch.. Related #2209. There seems to be one template board at MongoDB database, and I tried to add my user to that board, but when I click Templates, Wekan goes to url /b and shows text Board not found.. Huh? I'm currently trying to fix current Wekan v2.37. Old versions are not supported.. Try Wekan v2.35 is the problem there.. Moved to here from #2232\nNOTE: Wekan has had some major changes to webhooks, Wekan UI etc recently, please wait, fixing bugs is in progress.\nFrom @cyberfarer \nI added a new admin, so I imagine it is related, but I am seeing the following log:\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]: Exception while invoking method '/cards/update' TypeError: Cannot read property 'title' of undefined\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at cardMove (models/cards.js:1301:21)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at Object.<anonymous> (models/cards.js:1461:5)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at packages/matb33_collection-hooks.js:486:20\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at Function._.each._.forEach (packages/underscore.js:139:11)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at packages/matb33_collection-hooks.js:485:11\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at Function._.each._.forEach (packages/underscore.js:139:11)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at after (packages/matb33_collection-hooks.js:484:9)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at Object.<anonymous> (packages/matb33_collection-hooks.js:505:5)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at Object.collection.(anonymous function) [as update] (packages/matb33_collection-hooks.js:146:21)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at ns.Collection.CollectionPrototype._validatedUpdate (packages/allow-deny/allow-deny.js:355:34)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at DDPCommon.MethodInvocation.m.(anonymous function) (packages/allow-deny/allow-deny.js:173:46)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at packages/check.js:128:16\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at Meteor.EnvironmentVariable.EVp.withValue (packages/meteor.js:1186:15)\nMar 05 14:02:02 pydio wekan.wekan[13107]:     at Object._failIfArgumentsAreNotAllChecked (packages/check.js:127:41). @justinr1234 \nI think there is already fix for swimlaneId bug in Wekan v2.44 that is currently being built.. > Moving boards around on the \"My Boards\" page for better organization.\nMoved to #641\n\nAdding more than 6 colors to choose from when creating a new board.\n\nMoved to #2156. Moved to #2226. Upcoming Wekan release will partially fix this, thanks to @andresmanelli :\n- Works: Copying card with Subtasks\n- Does not work yet: Copying card with Custom Fields. This will be fixed later. . Moved to #1318. I'm currently building new Wekan v2.44 release that includes this fix. Please add comment to this issue if there still is problem after upgrading to Wekan v2.44.. Needs to be tested before closing this.. This can be tested with snap beta:\nsudo snap refresh wekan --beta --amend\nChanging back to stable Wekan version:\nsudo snap refresh wekan --stable --amend. @bentiss \nI tried this at wekan/client/components/boards/boardsList.js line 23. On new Wekan board it seems to work, but on old Wekan board order of boards keeps changing. I don't know why.\nboards() {\n    return Boards.find({\n      archived: false,\n      'members.userId': Meteor.userId(),\n      type: 'board',\n      subtasksDefaultListId: null,\n    }, { sort: [['stars', 'desc'], ['color', 'asc'], ['title', 'asc'], ['description', 'asc']] });\n  },. @bentiss \nYes, boards are changing and being sorted randomly. I'll try to add _id.. Making new docs and website is already in progress. Please contribute by sending PRs.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekanhow. @justinr1234 \nThere is existing environment variable that can be set DEBUG=true so could you add some PR for this?. Related bug https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/78. Subtask board should not be possible to set to itself.\n@andresmanelli Can you fix this?. @rjevnikar \n\nWith subtask boards being hidden on All Boards, you can easily lose easy access to a board if you set the default subtask board as itself.\n\nCan you include recorded gif animation about how this bug happends and makes something disappear? Is there still some bug?\n@xxpqxx \n\nCreate a Subtask in same board is very useful. In my workflow i use one board per project.\n\nCan you include recorded gif animation about your workflow? Does it work, or is there some bug?. In Wekan v2.43 is new feature Hide Subtask boards from All Boards.\nI did get that feature request from Wekan users. After implementing it, I did get this bug report that Subtask boards are hidden. Nice. Well, how it should work?. @bilalsavas \nWell, that's the point. Editing subtasks is possible in cards, and currently Subtasks are added to new Subtasks boards. But Subtasks were hidden from All Boards, because some did think it is a bug to see all the clutter from all the Subtask boards.. Moved to #641. @eoshared \nPlease wait that Wekan v2.46 is available at https://snapcraft.io/wekan or https://quay.io/wekan/wekan and then upgrade. Snap is upgraded automatically or manually with sudo snap refresh. At Wekan v2.46 Subtask boards are visible again.. Wekan only loads to webbrowser those cards that are visible in 100% view. When scrolling cards to not-loaded area, Wekan loads some new cards.  This makes possible loading boards that have thousands of cards. Zoom out is not implemented yet, I would think it would slow down webbrowser.\n@bentiss Do you know is it possible to implement zoom out?. @gerroon \nWhat is your use case for this?\na) Do you have large monitor and would like overview of project?\nb) Would like to print Wekan board?. c) export as PDF / CSV ?. @gerroon \nIn Standalone Wekan, click on right top corner your username that shows Member settings => Change Settings => Show cards count if list contains more than => change to number 1 and click Apply. This shows count of cards. Is it enough for you for this use case?. @gerroon \nMaybe because you did zoom? I think zoom bugs are not fixed yet.. @gerroon \nWell, according to you there is, because you created this issue. You told that zooming makes card load animation show all the time. I have not tested this yet. . @gerroon \nI am unable to duplicate this bug. Please add recorded animation git about how you get this showing.. You have not configured root-url correctly\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Settings. rebuild-wekan.sh at https://github.com/wekan/wekan does 1 install dependencies 2 build to wekan/.build/bundle.

After building, start-wekan.sh at https://github.com/wekan/wekan does start Wekan with required environment variables and changing to correct directory.

It emphasis on the Libre as an adjective and Board as the main functional unit..\nBut also if we write it like Libreboard it sounds like a board of liberty, emphasing Liberty and a place to show it...\nAlso i vote for LibreBoard with capital \"B\" but i can't imagine how it will look like... \n. These are really great!!! @neynah\n. Totally agree\n. When we solve the UI issues we need to follow LibreOffice license because once upon a time they were also a clone of MSoffice 98 with a diffrence, they wrote it from scratch maybe some reverse engineering... Now they have mozilla license: http://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/licenses/\n. CSS Files are open and downloadable and yes they are work of Trello.  The main (initial) idea is a demonstration for MeteorJS, to attract contributors' attention which is not just talking but developing. If we could have this we could do it before that event occurs.\nNo ONE claims that LibreBoard is  a commercial product of a company called LibreBoard or any other. \nAll the current effort is for developing a new UI right now.\n.

    "TylerL-uxai": "\n. \n. UX nerd here: Can you guys redesign the \"Boards\" button? :smiley: From an info architecture point of view, a side bar (\"secondary nav\") seems more appropriate. I can make a sketch later. Think of slack's ui where the rooms/convos are on the left in a column. Or your default notes application for mac. I think that's how a number of boards should be managed.\nYou could even use material design and make use of \"progressive disclosure\" where hitting the board button pops out the nav.\n. Everyone's talking about Stu's so I'll chime in:\nReally good job, Stu\nI think 'boards' button being on the top right might not follow convention. Normally it's primary links horizontally on top, secondary links vertically on the left side, and utilities or tertiary links on the top right.\nI like the skeumorphic style. When distinguishing between this and the default ui, I'd say Trello has a more visceral feel of grouping cards because they're separated and contained within each dark area. Right now it just looks like a list and it isn't clear that they're cards in a container. I don't think people will immediately get this concept (that it's cards in a group) when looking at the software for the first time.\n. \nAs for the number of lists visible on the screen (3? 4? 5?), you could make the argument for 4. We used to think we could hold 7 things in our short term memory, but recent research has shown it's more like 4 or 5. I actually like trello's sized lists on my laptop screen because there's 4 and a half. The half list indicates that you can scroll right to see more lists. I think that's the perfect number of lists to be on a screen at any one time.\n. @ocdtrekkie True, you make a good point. For laptops, I guess I'd like at least 4 dude. And can we make this responsive for mobile to have just one? Here's a sketch. Sorry it looks really polished. Trust me, it took just a few minutes to make.. So feel free to criticize the heck out of it! I'm going to make a sketch of a secondary nav I'd like to see that can distinguish our app from trello (and avoid DMCA complaints)\n\n. Here's the sketch for some ux improvements. Basically everything you need to be productive. The notes is placed at the bottom, so your list of notes can grow into infinity and all you need to do is scroll down. (Although a load more button is possible).\nYou could put a search bar up top as well.\nThink Slack + Trello + Notes ftw\n\n. \"Do we need a sidebar?\"\nI haven't used the activity sidebar feature, but then again, I do most my work on jira at my real job. That's an interesting design question worth asking everybody here. How much do you love the right side bar on trello?\nAlso, we can group some of these functions together and put them in a Settings modal to keep the interface clean. \nI like the hamburger icon + list instead of selecting from a boards page\nThe gray sounds good. One thing to consider is the visual weight of your top navigation bar. The darker gray you go, the less visual weight the dark navigation bar will have. So while it makes the white text boxes pop more, it makes the whole page pop less. That's why I used light grays in my design (the red one above). Your call, boss! Just providing you with information to make your decision.\n. @ryngonzalez makes an excellent point! One thing I noticed using hipchat + jira (it's like slack + trello) is back and forth between chat window and project management board. It'd be cool if we could use sockets.io to let people select things, like you can have multiple people edit the same document in Google Docs. I'd love to see a box with a highlight around it from my project manager. It'd be even better if we added chat and kept it to the same website. I showed this possibility in the red sketch above where the side navigation has Private Messages, Chat Room Channels, Trello Boards, and a section for Notes. That's a holistic approach to project usecase, if you ask me.\n. love what @fnky did\nIdea: just brainstorming here, if you moved the green button to the left side of the list box, would that make it more scannable? I like how you have it as well.\nI think it's looking really good in terms of actual interface changes. What would the lists look like if they were even like a darker gray or a brownish dark grey with white text instead? Just curious.\nGood work!\nTyler\nEdit: Just noticed.. I LIKE the drop shadows on each box! When the user clicks to drag the box, we can increase the drop shadow as well! make it look like it's farther up. I think the extra layer goes very well contrasted above the flat background.\n. @fnky Check this out. Tell me what you think\nJust a quick sketch we can perfect later\n\n. Here we have buttons moved left for scannability. I think I like it better with the button on the right, maybe...\n\n. @mquandalle Nice sketches as well! Going to be tough to decide which format to go with :) I can see where you're inspired by Google Now with the headings being outside the lists and as part of the background.\n. @mquandalle I think one thing we need to consider is our user. Is he going to be working alone or on a team?\nIf on a team, I'd recommend a side-bar with the extra functionality (such as chat, 1 on 1 messages, and notes)\nIf he's just doing his own thing, then those might be superfluous features.\nThe other nice-to-have feature to roadmap is Natural Language Processing and identifying the cards. And then when people chat, being able to refer to each card with a #searchterm\nDepends on our resources/ability to implement obv. I'm just going by actual behavior out in the wild. Another thing we use is gchat to voice/video chat. So if we could add a group voice feature to the chat rooms, that would be mega. ;) Plenty of possibilities to work on!\nBut yeah, I sort of realized you can have unlimited sub-menus in the secondary nav because the page can be infinitely long. Good for things with lots of links, like wikipedia or this situation where you want to manage a lot of stuff.\nIf we had an idea of our user as a person, that would help narrow down the focus of the design. Is this person a software developer? Maybe they just want to write lists and aren't on a team. How comfortable are they with technology? Is English their native language? I'm assuming we're writing this software for us, a bunch of open source dev types. Which is why I suggested extra features.\nWhen I envision who we're making this software for, it isn't for average people. It's for software developers, pretty much...\n. Playing around with background styles....\n\n. Playing around with background styles....\n\n. As for how to make things look \"good\"... it's all about contrast. So if you have bigger text on the list titles with regular sized text in the boxes, it's going to look better. When someone says if something looks good, they probably mean there's a lot of contrast. You already have some of that going on with the dark background and light lists. Big + small. Dark + light. This is how you make contrast.\n. nata-g I specialize in human error. Trust me, the first mistake I made was dragging and dropping it on to the title. It makes sense that way to some people based on actual evidence of my user test.\nAlso, dropping on to the title works on trello.com\n. \n. \n. ",

You can't take a design like that and \"tweak it\" without the help of the original designer.\nThe community has done its part for now. Stu's design was the majority's favorite. You don't need 10 contributors to accomplish what comes next, no matter how cool and intoxicating it is that so many people have been willing to pour so much energy into this. (I've hardly seen anything like it, so cool!. I'm sure it'll come in handy again when it's time to open the floor for smaller iterations and possibly alternative themes if that's ever supported).\nIn Stu's own words\n\nI'm happy to discuss the potential of using my mockup design but I would want my input. There is a lot of different opinions on here (which is good btw) and I'd be worried that once everyone has there input we could end up with a car crash of 100 different styles and ideas.\n\nThis is exactly where you are headed right now. There's no room in here for a single, unified direction.\nMy 2 cents: Stop this discussion, get in touch with Stu and finish the design that you already know is fully capable of wow-ing people. Conserve some of this energy for a different occasion.\n. ",
    "ePirat": "Quick adaption of the Cube Notes: \n\n.

Can I rename Libreboard to Wekan in the Wiki?\n. Added a wiki page about installing Libreboard: https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/wiki/Install\n. It seems this is fixed in the current development version? At least I am not able to reproduce it with latest master.\n. @rwatts3 Yes, 0.9 is a redesign, in order to not infringe the Trello copyright anymore.\n. It would be great if this issue could be renamed to a proper title, as the current one is actually wrong, given what the issue has turned into.\n. @martinhbramwell This issues, as far as I can see, was never close but the referenced issue about another REST API issue was closed. I don't think anyone meant to insult you by not answering. I had a look at the Swagger thing using your JSON and I am a bit confused how this thing works, but it looks interesting. \n. Please use the new Github feature that allows adding reactions to comments/issues and use the thumbs up: \ud83d\udc4d instead of all the +1 comments, which are incredibly annoying.\n. I am not sure but I think it would not be so easy to still benefit from all meteor features if we would need to call the rest api for all things. And requiring to install a nodejs and a PHP application just to use a tool is not really easy deployment, imho. If I understood correctly the plan was to add a REST API to get out some of the information in machine readable format, not to build all of Wekan on top of a REST API.\n. The git.libreboard.com repo seems to have the tags that are missing here. It think this was due to the DMCA takedown, as it seems a lot of old commits containing infringing files were removed here, for obvious reasons.\n. That is because the old Version was infringing Trello's copyright, so a UI redesign was done/is currently worked on. The online libreboard is still an older version than the current master.\n. I had the same problem when I tried to build the app, after I deleted the build directory (which already had an older version) it worked fine. Not really sure why.\nTo which directory are you trying to build? Or are you trying to run it using meteor run?\n. It sounds like you have built the app inside the source directory, as per this Stackoverflow answer:\n\nMeteor picks up all javascript files in your project's folder including nested folders. By saving your bundle in the same directory as your project, you just duplicated a lot of files and now Meteor is going to pick them up as \"new source files\". To avoid this, output your bundles to a separate directory from your project or to a hidden folder that is ignored by Meteor build tool (any folder name starting with a dot).\n\n(I've just tried out and built the app to a folder inside the app sources, to confirm that this causes the issue, and have exactly the same errors as you have. Note that the built tool will even warn about this.)\nUse the following command to built to a specific directory:\nmeteor build ./build --directory\nNote that you do not have to do this in order to execute meteor. The build command is intended to create a production build of the app, to run it on your server.\nIf you are still experiencing problems, even choosing a build directory outside the meteor app sources, I can write a short guide how to get it up and running.\n. @mquandalle I don't think it has anything to do specifically with it, it's just that meteor will try to build files that are already built, resulting in a lot of errors.\n. Note that, for production use you should use the package created with meteor build not just run meteor\n. In the current git master version this is not possible, as it is under heavy development due to UI redesign. I am not sure if this is a planned feature for the final version, but iirc this was possible in the 0.7 version, so it should come back.\n. This affects drag-and-drop of labels as well, I am not able to drag a label to cards from the sidebar anymore.\n. Indeed, it is fixed now.\n. @mquandalle What will happen with the other one?\n. Please note, just running meteor command is not the correct way to set up a production server, it is only intended for development!\n. The correct steps to set up libreboard for production use are the following:\n1. Clone the git repository\nsh\n   git clone https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard.git`\n(This clones the latest development version, use a tag instead if you want a stable one)\n2. Install meteor, follow the guide on their website to do so.\n3. Change to the directory you just cloned and execute the meteor build command:\n   Make sure the directory you specify for the build command is not in your project directory and it's empty or does not exist, else it will be deleted recursively!\nsh\n   cd ./libreboard && meteor build ../libreboard-build --directory\n4. Change to the build server directory and install dependencies:\nsh\n   cd ../libreboard-build/bundle/programs/server && sudo npm install\n5. Change back to be base build directory\nsh\n   cd ../../../\n6. Set the needed environment variables:\n   In order to run, you need to set some env varaibles:\nsh\n   export MONGO_URL='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/libreboard'\n   export ROOT_URL='https://example.com'\n   export MAIL_URL='smtp://user:pass@mailserver.example.com:25/'\n   export PORT=8080\n7. Run the server\nsh\n   node main.js\n. Oh and obviously you need to have mongodb installed and set up correctly.\n. Most of the bugs are due to the current master is under heavy development, as a new design is worked on, and a lot of code has to be rewritten for that purpose.\nIf you need a stable version, consider either waiting for 0.9 release or use 0.8 (if possible, not sure if it is still available)\n. I have added install instructions to the wiki: https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/wiki/Install\nWould be great if someone could extend the Docker section, as I have no idea how that stuff works ;)\n. I don't think that is a good idea right now. Maybe a link only, if really necessary. Those instructions will change when 0.9 is realeased and I just put them up in the wiki so that there is at least somethign there that people can use, to prevent unsafe installations. \n. > why installing is so complicated\nIt isn't really that complicated, that's usual node apps build process.\nI am not sure why you have issues with fibers, I can't reproduce them. BTW try not to use nodejs but node instead. (Create a symlink so that you can use node instead of nodejs)\n. @xiaohelong2005 There is no new release yet and it would not make sense to package anything that is not a final release.\n. That's weird, which browser are you using? I can't reproduce with Safari or latest Chrome.\n. Which browser are you using?\n. Are you sure you are running the latest version in production mode? Can't reproduce the problem here.\n. I don't think that this is really the latest development version there, not sure.\n. I think using some tool like imagemagick (optionally) like a lot of other web apps and software (i.e. Mediawiki) does, should be a reasonable way to handle this, although not that easy to implement.\n. Yeah sure, that's why I suggested to make it optional, no matter when the feature will be added. So if there is for some reason no imagemagick it should just use the avatar without conversion if it is reasonable small.\n. The card ID appears in the URL when you click a card. You can link to the card by using that URL.\n. Ok great, when 0.9 is released together with the build tarball I will update the wiki installation instructions.\n. Sorry that I did not use Transifex, but it was faster for me do to it directly in the json instead of first signing up to some website and translating it there.\n. I agree, just ping me whenever there are new translations needed and I will look into it, making them properly. (BTW why is Github still showing the always failing travis-ci checks here?)\n. Sure, feel free to add me to the German team.\n. While this seemed to work fine in the testcase, it breaks on other places\u2026 :disappointed: \n. We need to make sure we redirect old URL's properly to the new ones.\n. :+1: indeed I have similar problems which would be solved by that. Maybe even an optional captcha.\n. I have no idea why that happens. Please post the full steps you've done here so we can better reproduce what the problem could be.\n. I need every command you performed and it's output. Your description above sounds fine, that's why I am asking for this. \n. I mean more like the steps that you did before that, as it seems there is something wrong with your meteor install.\n. At least I am currently not able to find any known bug on node-fibers repo which could explain that.\n. I am not using Windows, so I can't try the guide.. @mquandalle Indeed, when I wrote that guide (if I recall correctly), v0.10 was the latest stable, but it's not anymore, so the correct version would be 0.10 (or higher in the future, depending which meteor needs)\n. As this isn't a real bug of libreboard as far as I know, I am not sure if it belongs here, anyway. Could you provide me with the full output of the meteor build .build --directory command?\n. Please do not mix topics in one bugreport, as it's else impossible to keep track of properly. If you really think that archiving a board should be easier, open a new issue for it and explain then issue a bit from your point of view. (Personally I think archiving a board isn't something I need to do so often)\n. Which node version are you using?\n. Please try to use node 0.10.x as 0.12 is too new for some dependencies to work properly.\n. I don't think we can use meteor-up as it needs information such as:\njson5\n// Server authentication info\n  \"servers\": [\n    {\n      \"host\": \"hostname\",\n      \"username\": \"root\",\n      \"password\": \"password\",\n      // or pem file (ssh based authentication)\n      //\"pem\": \"~/.ssh/id_rsa\",\n      // Also, for non-standard ssh port use this\n      //\"sshOptions\": { \"port\" : 49154 },\n      // server specific environment variables\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  ],\nwhich we can't possibly know.\n. No, there are no admin settings or an admin account implemented yet, as far as I know. (btw if your issue is resolved, please close this bug and if you another issue not related to this, open a new one)\n. Should this be scrollable or would it be better to wrap it to newlines?\n. So what exactly is the issue you are experiencing? Does it just do nothing after Finishing add-member-isactive-field migration.?\n. Indeed the \n``\ntoEnd: wrong arguments-i18n-compiler fr... -\nto: wrong arguments\n```\nis really weird output and looks somewhat broken. It doesn't even make any sense for me and I have no idea what it causes\u2026\n. I've just checked, it seems on latest meteor version, the weird\n``\ntoEnd: wrong arguments-i18n-compiler fr...\nto: wrong arguments\n```\nis normal, it happens for me as well but still the final build works fine.\nNote that it is expected that output stops and the app will not exit, as it's supposed to be run by a watchdog/service like systemd. So just try to connect, if it works you just have to use your prefered service manager to run it in the background or use the simple \nsh\nnode main.js &\necho $! > ./pid.txt\napproach.\n. @ffvpor The issue is already resolved :) (See comments above)\nIn other words, I think this can be closed?\n. I am not able to reproduce with latest master.\n. I am not able to reproduce with latest master.\n. Indeed, I will update the wiki instructions later today. I like the idea with the discourse forum and gitter seems to be awesome, given that I can use it via my irc client as well :+1:\nI consider this answered, but if you don't think so, feel free to reopen.\n. I don't think that a permission model is implemented yet? If this gets implemented there should be a way to allow all board members to assign other members to cards, as I can see that this can be useful on some boards.\n. It is working as expected (the markup is generated correctly), but the styles are missing. That's why it looks like it isn't working.\n. There is a guide in the Wiki that describes how to do that.\n. I don't think you will find this, Wekan heavily depends on Meteor. \n. No, I don't think this is possible, Wekan heavily uses all the features that meteor offers.\n. ",
    "ocdtrekkie": "@ePirat I definitely agree.\n. I think @neynah may be interested in this thread.\n. Doesn't Google Apps for login defeat a lot of the point of self-hosting?\nOn Jan 25, 2015 12:02 AM, \"Andrei Oprisan\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI think Google Apps integration would be a better bet and you can use this\nin the future feature development (i.e. managed team access)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/66#issuecomment-71354758\n.\n. @mountwe Sandstorm is a new cloud platform you can find out more about at https://www.sandstorm.io\n\nIt can either be run on a hosted server or any Linux machine. I suggest trying out the Sandstorm demo, where you can install LibreBoard from their 'app store' with one click and try it out on their servers to see how it works. ;) Sandstorm is relatively easy to install (one command, basically), if you have a compatible Linux server with a high enough kernel version.\nIn the releases tab, where you see an SPK file download, that is a Sandstorm package file.\n. Also, as a Meteor application, it should be able to be installed or deployed in the same way as any other Meteor application, I believe. So you can look to any information on the Internet as to how to run and/or deploy Meteor applications.\n. Ah, @blessenm you might hit a snag there. Pretty much everything relating to Meteor (or Sandstorm or Docker) is done on Linux. Someone did port Meteor to Windows, but it is not updated to the latest version, and I am guessing there's not a lot of people that would be able to step you through a Windows deployment of Meteor or a Meteor app.\nIf you're hoping to host it on something not running Linux, you'd probably not fall within the confines of a readme as it is.\n. Someone just told me that one of the core Meteor devs is working on a more official Windows version of Meteor now.\n. @mimoo If you install Sandstorm, you just click the \"Install apps\" button on Sandstorm, go to LibreBoard, and click Install.\nYou only need to separately install Meteor if you want to run LibreBoard as a standalone application. The Sandstorm app is a separate version.\n. @mimoo That is more likely a Sandstorm.io configuration problem than a LibreBoard problem. @paulproteus would be the best to help you troubleshoot this, though he's at a conference so I am not sure when he may find this and join us here. Some issues like this: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/114 might help you figure out what needs to be done. DNS configuration is currently one of the pain points yet to be fully resolved with Sandstorm.\n. @judegimeno I haven't heard of any shared hosting that lets you run Meteor apps. There might be one out there somewhere. \n. I definitely think it should take on it's own style, though the feature parity being so close is particularly appealing, since some people may really like Trello but need a secure on-premises solution. Changing icons is probably the most trivial of changes, and there are likely public domain or very permissively licensed icons out there that will do the job.\n. @MichaelBanks Always classy to try to drag in the lawyers while a responsible discussion is already underway. :+1: \n@mquandalle It is definitely a hard battle to fight to convince people that their data is valuable, and storing it on someone else's server is almost never for their benefit. I've discussed this with people who do not believe it's physically possible to create say... Google Now... in a manner that secures your data privately. Cloud-based businesses have made a living on changing public opinion to believe that they have users' best interests at heart, and that nothing they offer is possible on your own computers or with a methodology where they cannot read your data.\nParticularly for something like a kanban board (being far from a new concept for Trello), project development info is most of the time confidential to a business, and probably one of the top things that would be great to operate internally rather than on a public host.\nAnd I agree, as the featureset expands, and the style evolves, you'll end up with a unique product.\n. @mquandalle You might take a look at the icon source Sandstorm is currently using. These are Creative Commons licensed, and they've available as SVG files, which are nice because they can be programmatically resized and transformed fairly easily. (I tweaked one with a pull request.)\nhttp://thenounproject.com/naomiatkinson/uploads/\nSandstorm used another icon from a different creator at thenounproject.com as well where a suitable icon was not available in this set.\n. @syrnick Given that the code is original, as long as the style sheet is freshly written and does not share any text with the original (beyond CSS property tags that are obviously standardized), it'd be quite demonstrable that no copyrighted material was in use. The code is entirely open in this case, and written from scratch, so only the contents of the style sheet are really at stake.\n. Also, @syrnick, according to Github's DMCA policy: https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/ this repo will likely not be removed. As only select files were infringing, and the author has complied with the request for their removal.\n. So, I assume going forward, to ensure DMCA compliance, the repo in the future will just have 0.9 and up?\n. @centigrade-thomas-becker The original version of this project was much more close in style and branding to Trello. The old version was removed, retooled, eventually renamed, and is no longer materially similar to Trello in any way that copyright would affect.. You have a GitHub name someone else used to have. Don't worry about it. :). Nope. @markentingh This is a three year old conversation that is long-since closed. Wekan wasn't even called Wekan back then, and the design has been completely rebuilt since then.. Have you considered asking any of the people who have made their own redesign mockups directly if they would design for LibreBoard?\nOne thing I see in a lot of these that is a particular peeve of mine of the UI design some companies are using these days: Please avoid differentiating elements solely by varying shades of light grey. It can be difficult to see on poorly contrasted monitors.\n. Another crazy thought: Could LibreBoard support multiple styles? There is a good point that it should not by default use Trello's. (Though it is common for users to host sites designed to look like other sites, and it may be acceptable to have a similar option.)\nThen new styles could be tested or tried, and that could end up being a core differentiating feature as well. As traditional closed source cloud service products like Trello offer limited customization in that regard.\n. @zakbach I'd move further discussion of copyright or trademark issues to #92.\n@stugreenham There's some things about your design that's appealing, and I guess I buy the notion of hiding less used things like user controls in a menu. However it looks like you also hid the feed, which I consider pretty critical of Trello. In a large board, that feed is how you know if anything is different since last time you opened it.\nMy other note is that you seem to have nearly doubled the vertical space between cards. And the top bar seems to be very thick as well. I know companies like Google have been pushing incredibly bloated padding and margins as the \"new\" look and feel, but it feels like a huge compromise in space utilization for meager to non-existent benefits.\n. @stugreenham I am a big fan of compact display density as a setting. :) I would still likely be a happy Google customer if they were willing to keep offering it on their newer products.\nIf the feed's hidden by default on Trello, I might just never have noticed. The sidebar does collapse, I suppose, though it remembers it's position, perhaps, because I never see it collapsed.\n. Copying my notes here from #97 \n@ozodrukh I will cry many tears if this goes material design. Many. Tears. #materialnono\nI don't think a free software project should be implementing Google's branding. And material design has poor contrast between various layers.\n. I think Stu's probably the best bet, if he's interested in taking it on, as I assume it's a fairly hefty workload. I'd really love if the ability to change out styles was actually a feature for LibreBoard in the future, as it'd be a particularly key differentiation from traditional cloud services. (Under such a system, something like Stu's could even be default, but it'd be possible to have a more Trello-ish style available as well, for example.)\n. @ozodrukh They're already cards... Everything on kanban boards is cards...\n. @cjb Soooooo much wasted space o_o\n. The number of visible lists depends on your screen size. Trello fits six and a half on mine. (Maybe you need a better screen?) Large high resolution screens rightfully should display more information than smaller screens.\n. It would make sense for mobile to have just one wide before scrolling.\nAs for your mockup, I'd probably suggest the top bar should be more distinctly different than Trello's in style as well.\n. The biggest thing I need from a sidebar or similar UI element is the\nability to see the recent history of people manipulating cards.\n-Jake Weisz\nOn Wed, Jan 28, 2015 at 8:46 AM, JJ notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nFrom my point of view it would make sense for easy selecting tags to\nnavigate through big amounts of cards (see: #98\nhttps://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/98).\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/94#issuecomment-71845498\n.\n. I like the @mquandalle WIP better than @fnky mockup. Colors look cleaner, and less space is wasted on mquandalle's. You only need so many nested borders on a page!\n\nBut it needs a history sidebar.\n. @catmanjan Given that the preview @mquandalle gave above was like two days of work, I imagine it will not be very long.\n. @litera The UI in the one you just posted is so faint, it just appears to be floating blocks of text on my screen.\n. @TheElf Material design, is, by definition, terribly unclear language. (There's a recent article by Lauren Weinstein, who has actually done a lot of work for Google, about how 'modern' UIs tend to fail badly: http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001112.html)\nAnother piece on specific issues with Material Design, particularly with color contrast, as used by Google, is here: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2014/12/do-all-google-employees-have-perfect-eyesight/\n. @TheElf I suppose it's definitely important to qualify what sort of \"material design elements\" you talk about then. ;) I'd definitely agree shadows can help define layers of the UI. (Though it can't be the sole indicator of hierarchy, as fine details like shadows are completely overlooked by some viewers.) There are other elements I'd be more wary of though, like Google's recent fascination with animations, which can be resource-intensive.\n. I will cry many tears if this goes material design. Many. Tears. #materialnono\n. @ozodrukh Your mock-up is fine, but I don't think a free software project should be implementing Google's branding. And material design has poor contrast between various layers.\n. @kadishmal I think eventually Sandstorm.io will make this relatively easy. (The existing LibreBoard version works(ish) on Sandstorm, GitLab is already available on Sandstorm, there are chat apps that work on Sandstorm. Document, spreadsheet, and flowcharting apps on Sandstorm. All with unified user identity.)\nThe big question in how to tackle these is how you standardize. Some may want to use kanban app A, which integrats with repo app B, but they're using repo app C, which integrates with kanban app D. Ideally, you want multiple kanban apps to work with multiple repo apps so you can pick your preferences. I know Sandstorm intends to let apps open up interfaces to connect with each other in different ways, though that isn't possible yet.\n. @kadishmal I'm certainly not suggesting that it should \"lock in\" to any particular distribution method. Though for the one developer actively working on LibreBoard at the moment (AFAIK), developing integrations to other types of apps (and ideally some sort of unified login, be it LDAP or otherwise) is probably a tall order (in note that 0.9 still isn't completed). Sandstorm isn't really meant to be just \"for beginners\", but to solve these sorts of problems... ensuring that apps can easily connect to other apps.\nThat being said, I'm guessing, being that you guys are Node gurus, that a PR would be seriously considered, as they tend to speak louder than feature requests. (And more than likely the same hooks that might work for standalone LibreBoard would end up being the same hooks to build on for any future Sandstorm integrations as well.)\n. Where's it pulling data from meteor.com?\n. Ah, if you're just talking about libreboard.com, it's worth bearing in mind that the very nature of an open project clone you can self-host should carry some recommendation that the creators don't put a lot of stock in cloud security you don't host yourself. I'd recommend LibreBoard's own site for testing, but if you're looking for security, you should probably be self-hosting.\n. @singpolyma Meteor is the platform this project is written in. They allow Meteor projects to be deployed and hosted on their servers for free for easy development, testing, and play. But you can also host Meteor projects elsewhere as well, of course.\n. @singpolyma Documenting one's hosting provider is pretty abnormal. If you care enough for it to matter, you should be self-hosting.\n. As a point of note, LDAP support for Sandstorm is now available for free: https://sandstorm.io/news/2017-02-06-sandstorm-returning-to-community-roots. @klinger Sandstorm is definitely viable without direct access to the Internet.. @joaquin386 Until someone feels so inclined to write a PR to add direct support, yes.. @florent37 \"You and this LinkedIn user don\u2019t know anyone in common\nYou can only view the profiles of users within your network. However, as you add connections, you may discover people you know in common.\"\n. As a personal note from a Sandstorm user, I really like how Tiny Tiny RSS has a proper mobile-style app and connects to my Tiny Tiny RSS instance in Sandstorm via an API key. I would definitely find it a key perk of any app that can do that.\n. @mquandalle is still working on the redesign AFAIK.\n. Local filesystem would definitely be nice. Not sure someone who wants a self-hosted board is going to really want to store data on Google or Amazon clouds though, as that largely defeats the point.\n. Back on Github! \\o/\n. This is the documentation for how Sandstorm handles APIs: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Exporting-HTTP-APIs and the only app currently using it: https://github.com/jparyani/Tiny-Tiny-RSS\nI don't know if it's useful to @martinhbramwell or not, but ideally the API should work well with Sandstorm as well as without.\n. FYI, isn't my page (I don't work on Sandstorm, I just like playing with it). But right now Sandstorm implements API keys, and has a UI for creating them and revoking them, rather than an OAuth flow.\nLibreBoard could benefit from either an API key-based or OAuth-based solution depending on what the API is being used for. Though from my understanding, OAuth workflows tend to assume you're talking to a known centralized entity on one side of the equation (Google, Facebook, Github, etc.) and the setup for that may not be as straightforward for something like LibreBoard, where it may be hosted anywhere.\n. @martinhbramwell Being able to import from Trello (a centralized entity) via their API is pretty important, but I was also thinking in terms of allowing other things to import/export to and from LibreBoards. Potentially other open source apps that might integrate, or a mobile app someday, etc. Each LibreBoard running it's own OAuth service in that case would be a bit odd perhaps.\n. @martinhbramwell I think @mquandalle was universally quiet for a while. \n. I think if you use Sandstorm's Share link to create a sharing link, and a logged in use clicks it, they will be added to LibreBoard and be able to edit. But 0.9 will have more robust Sandstorm sharing support. \n. @mquandalle Is still working to reimplement all of the 0.8 features in 0.9. It is apparently about a 70% rewrite of the entire application.\n. 70% rewrite of LibreBoard, not Sandstorm.\n. @genecraig Where do you think Wekan has the money to hire people? ...Under what do you even suspect Wekan has any money at all. Please stop trolling this project.. This isn't a startup. You seem to make the mistake of thinking this is a business. It is not. It's a charity for ungrateful people like you. :). LibreBoard is built with Meteor (see meteor.com). You can definitely run Meteor applications on your server without Sandstorm or Docker, but it will need to be a server where Meteor can be installed.\n. It... will be. 0.9 isn't done, and 0.8 cannot be posted. \n. I can't see a huge reason to have a minimum account name length on a privately-owned board. And if you're a company with employees with two-character last names like \"Li\", it might not hurt to support first initial/last name schemes there, which would be three characters.\n. I, for one, think this sounds really cool. \n. This is a duplicate issue though with #119. Also: @kentonv\n. Generally speaking (assuming sharing works properly, which I don't believe it does in 0.8.0), when you create a sharing link, and then that user clicks on that link (while logged into Sandstorm), then they get added to the board.\nWhen 0.9.0 is completed, there should be more working in Sandstorm.\n. The version on the Sandstorm app list is 0.8.0, and it predates Sandstorm's new sharing model. Until 0.9.0 is released, sharing LibreBoard with Sandstorm doesn't work very well. \n. A test grain of tiago's SPK: https://oasis.sandstorm.io/shared/uhb45z9vIVNqyVtty6YR1xB76j4fhRB5mxRq1NBA1xh\n. @Prezto While the solution is not free (but is open source), Sandstorm.io recently launched their LDAP/SAML feature as \"Sandstorm for Work\". Their free software, of course, already supports Google and GitHub based login. Wekan runs pretty well as a Sandstorm app.\nNot a solution to the issue, but an option if you're unaware.\n. @Prezto Sandstorm for Work is designed to be self-hosted on your internal network. They offer a hosted solution as well, but it wasn't what I was suggesting. \n. @paulproteus would almost certainly want to know about your problem getting Sandstorm working.\n. \"We can\" is how I read it. I think \"can-ban\" in my head when I see that word too @yipcma, though I've never heard it spoken aloud by others, so I could be totally wrong.\n. @Valiantiam There is a pull request to add them, #630, but the maintainer appears to have abandoned the project. There is now a fork, at https://github.com/wefork/wekan, and they have an issue to add this: https://github.com/wefork/wekan/issues/11 but as of yet nobody has moved forward on that.. FYI, this feature has been merged.. @birdsarah Just to confirm, @mquandalle is right, it doesn't cost anything to sign into Sandstorm, or to use someone else's apps/files/grains they share with you. Signing in just identifies you as an individual and makes it possible to assign permissions to you. The grain owner's account (in this case, the Wekan board owner) pays for any usage by people they share with.\nAdditionally, Sandstorm Oasis actually has a free tier, so users can even run their own grains for free, and, of course, self-hosters probably don't charge for anything, but you need an invite to create your own grains.\n. @mquandalle I think what's being discussed or advocated for, is that if you have a link with editing permissions, Sandstorm would allow an anonymous user to use that permission. If an app was supportive of this, only people with that link could edit anonymously.\n. @mitar That EtherCalc issue is very old. Edit and View permissions work on EtherCalc on Sandstorm. (I know this because I use them.) I commented on the issue to remind audreyt to close it.\nAs @dwrensha suggested, EtherCalc does implement permissions, but doesn't have a strong concept of user identity.\n. I haven't read Wekan's CLA, but that seems a weird thing to refuse or make\nan issue of over a five-line PR that probably constitutes \"common sense\". I\ndoubt if any sort of re-licensing issue occurred this PR would have weight\nto affect it, so can I ask.... why, purely on curiosity grounds?\n. I'm not a maintainer, though your last sentence I think means you know that. The bot does it for all PRs (though having a minimum lines changed to ask would be a smart feature, I suppose).\nAlrighty, thanks for the answer. \n. @mquandalle Re: \"one pixel image\" is not a reliable methodology anymore. To prevent tracking, Google precaches all emails whether they're read or not. I suspect other providers do or will do this as well.\n. No idea. The classic tried and true is to let people select a daily digest mode of some sort.\nSource on the above, by the way:\nhttp://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/images-now-showing.html\nhttp://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/gmail-blows-up-e-mail-marketing-by-caching-all-images-on-google-servers/\n. @miherlosev Some of the Wekan community is currently working off of https://github.com/wefork/wekan and I don't think any CI testing is set up currently for that repo. But I think it would probably be quite welcome.. @pgrm: Once Sandstorm has the Powerbox fully implemented, you could essentially share a list from one Wekan grain to another Wekan grain, which would copy it.\n. My experience with the latest https://github.com/wefork/wekan version on Sandstorm using Microsoft Edge is that the comments do not display on a card until I hover over the \"Write a comment\" box, and then they seem to pop in and load. I do not know why.\n@xet7 Should issues like this be reopened against wefork, or is it safe to assume people still monitor and look at issues here?. wefork#60 seems to be fairly different to what Kenton and I have seen. Edge often shares some weird rendering quirks with it's elder cousin, and I'm fairly confident @kentonv and I have the same issue.. Nevermind, I understand what happened here I think. Wekan sets it's board name as \"Wekan\" by default, not my grain title. I thought it was a header for the app, not the board title there. I changed it, everything looks copacetic.\nIdeally someday there will be a way to sync the board title and grain title.\n. Generally, if you only have access to cPanel (meaning you use shared or managed hosting), you aren't able to run Wekan. Wekan uses a platform called Meteor that isn't installed by default on most hosting platforms.\nYou could always ask your host if they support Meteor or would install Meteor for you, but more than likely, you'll need to get a VPS or dedicated server to run Wekan.\n. I'm going to tag @paulproteus here because he might be able to help!\n. I don't think this is or would be Sandstorm specific. I wouldn't really know about this issue, if it's an issue.. Do not know/am not familiar that with the sandstorm.js contents of Wekan.. @kramer65 The maintainer of this project seems to be somewhat on hiatus. You may want to run the code from this PR yourself as a fork in the meantime, it'd be hard to give you a clear ETA on when either the maintainer will be active or a clear community fork will be available.\n. @mnewmedia No, repo is no longer dead. Wefork is being migrated back into Wekan!. FYI for everyone following this PR: This has been merged. So, update on that.. @mquandalle is likely busy or otherwise disposed, I assume. People get burned out doing solo management of a project like this. I don't think this was a full time gig for them. As to whether or not you should fork, I abstain.\nCLAs are effectively a way to prevent a contributor from coming back and suing claiming their rights were violated or some such down the road. But the project is licensed MIT and can be forked like any other MIT licensed code.\nNote that generally trademark doesn't go with code, so if you forked you would need to call it something else.\n. Sure, @AlexanderS, it depends what @mquandalle wants to do. Adding people willy-nilly has security risks, figuring out delegation is still potentially a lot of effort and time. It's really hard to suggest a path to follow without an opinion from the project's maintainer and those people who care and would put in the effort to work on this project. (At the end of the day, I personally don't care what anyone does, really, because the current Sandstorm package of Wekan does everything I need.)\n. I would suggest starting with @mquandalle's last comment here: A community-governed fork. Get everything set up and working, bring in the open PRs. Keep everything as aligned with the original repository as possible, submit PRs for changes made to the community fork to the main Wekan repository, so it is possible to sync them up at a later date if possible. Keep the differences well-documented, especially when it comes to data portability.\nWho runs the official repo of course, remains up to @mquandalle, but I imagine a well-running, well-supported fork would likely demonstrate best who is adequate to assist in maintaining the official repo, if that decision gets made.\nThe other person I'd recommend you keep in the loop is @dwrensha from Sandstorm.io (see PRs #689, #695, and #704). I'm not sure how many people percentage-wise of the Wekan community uses Sandstorm to host it, but it's a core app for Sandstorm, and there's a key trust relationship in terms of what version gets published and pre-installed for Sandstorm users.\n. @robisson There's a ton of active interest in Wekan and contributing to Wekan, so I have no doubt that this project will continue, but in the apparent absence of @mquandalle, everything is probably pending someone stepping up and creating a fork and reviewing and integrating the open PRs into it.\nI have a strong interest in Wekan's continuity and success, but since I am not familiar with it's code, and am not much of a developer, I'm hoping other people move on this.\nIn the meantime, if you have contributions, please do open PRs on wekan/wekan here, as this is both the initial source any well-managed forks would start from, and I'd also hope that PRs continue to be opened here for if and when the official repo comes back to life.\n. I am pretty excited to see the fork merging back into the master.. @mquandalle AFAIK, @xet7 does not use the Sandstorm flavor.\nRe: Sandstorm, @dwrensha utilized a key replacement feature of Sandstorm to allow a key controlled by him to issue releases of Wekan for Sandstorm. This feature could be used again to allow someone else's key to be officially supported for Wekan releases. Although this may not be necessary if David intends to continue publishing Wekan releases going forwards. On Wefork he had commit rights to push Sandstorm-specific code directly.. @oliver4u As a suggestion, you shouldn't create a pull request asking to merge your whitelabeling/debranding into the main app. ;)\n. There might be issues packaging for Sandstorm with Meteor 1.4. Check with @paulproteus there.\n. As mentioned in #657 eslint may require the Meteor 1.4 update which may have issues with Sandstorm packaging.\n. Don't Nextcloud apps still need to be PHP based? How would this work?. Generally you need a VPS at minimum to be able to install software that is needed to run Wekan. Shared hosting doesn't allow you to install things like Meteor, which Wekan is built on.\n. Everyone on wefork is surely still reading here. This is probably fine. :)\n. @Merlin90 The maintainer of Wekan has been silent for a while, so a bunch of other Wekan users/developers are working on the fork so that new stuff can continue to be done. So yes, it should have newer features coming, whereas we cannot be sure the speed at which this project will progress. As I said though, everyone on the fork is subscribed to the original though, so your feature request should still be seen either way. But if you ever open a Pull Request, make sure to open it against the fork as well.\n. @Merlin90 Yes, currently the fork is the same as the original plus a couple of relatively trivial fixes. Right now there is no major differences, but that will change over time, as the fork starts to add new features. The fork has not yet officially published a new release yet.\n. Hard to say for sure at this point.\n. This is usually caused by some sort of SSL error. It's worth noting that Wekan.io's SSL cert from Cloudflare is very recent (12/4/2016). With SSL errors, it's always worth double checking your own date and time settings.\nAs a note: The maintainer of Wekan has been very silent for the last several months, so you should not assume if something happens to Wekan.io that it will be fixed.. Strange, since the certificate covering wekan.io itself is a wildcard cert.. Check out http://github.com/wefork/wekan\nThe original maintainer has gone silent, but the community is definitely alive and still interested in working on the project.. @manuelsongokuh As the original maintainer is absent, we can't make any sort of redirects, unfortunately.\n@dcworldwide I use the Sandstorm.io version of Wekan, and I try and help out here with information and such, though I'm not really a developer.\n@manuelsongokuh I believe @xet7 just pulled in the latest from Transifex yesterday: https://github.com/wefork/wekan/commit/bdd88f486e28c02fa21a8c582a27e7d543e9c040. I recommend opening this pull request against https://github.com/wefork/wekan so that it can be reviewed and potentially merged.. As a useful note, the due date feature has already been added to Wekan in the community fork: https://github.com/wefork/wekan/pull/26. Yeah, sorry about that. The original maintainer has gone pretty silent, and nobody can updated or redirect people from the original repo. So I just try and point people along when I see them!. I recommend submitting the PR to https://github.com/wefork/wekan. @kentonv: @dwrensha is currently using a locally modified version of meteor-spk 0.2.1 and a monkey patch to Wekan code, detailed here: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/823. I think @dwrensha pretty much detailed everything in #823 but it may just be best for him to PR that being disabled when he packages the new version. It sounds like a lot of this will be simpler after Wekan moves to a newer Meteor version.. This actually should be closed as a duplicate of #119 . @remcooverweg Nobody is working on that at present, particularly with regards to the Sandstorm version. In order to do that, we would need to use Sandstorm's powerbox feature, of which only a handful of developers (none of which currently contribute to Wekan) have used.\nMy hope is that the recent internationalization features of Sandstorm will lead to an uptick in Sandstorm users and contributors, which may eventually expand out into more contributors making Sandstorm features work well in other apps.. I don't follow standalone very closely, but xet7 is pretty good about closing issues that are resolved. Since this issue is still open, my guess is standalone doesn't have this feature either. I do know it would be easier to code this with standalone Wekan than with Wekan for Sandstorm, but that doesn't mean anyone is working on it either.. @dwrensha Is it possible for you to package the release candidate for Sandstorm testing?. I've installed the rc1 spk on Alpha and upgraded a copy of my Ports in Progress Wekan grain. Everything looks alright so far. I created a checklist with it, and that seems to work sanely as well. Keyboard shortcuts shortcut appears and operates correctly. Not sure if much else needs to be tested for Sandstorm.. The ideal Sandstorm way to handle multiple boards would be to continue with Wekan only containing one board, but that trying to copy cards or lists to another board would bring up a Sandstorm powerbox to select a destination Wekan. That ensures the security isolation continues to work well, that people who can access one board can't tamper with another board even if there's a security issue.\nIf you can archive the old board when importing a Wekan board, that might be a smart choice just in case someone ignores the warning and overwrites the content accidentally. Presumably someone could dig into the grain backup and pull the lost data out of it with some effort.. Currently EtherCalc also overwrites the existing content as the import method. It's probably not ideal, but its better than nothing for now.. As a note, if the packaging hackery got smoothed out so people could build test packages for Sandstorm without David, it'd be easy for me to help people through setting up the separate Sandstorm command and such. But as it stands we have no way to test that.. In order to do that and it work in production, we'd also need to switch the signing key for Wekan away from David's key (might be prudent anyways since he doesn't seem super interested in building this regularly), and your build server would need to have the new key.\nBut at the very least, if we had a routine/reproducible way for people to build test packages of Wekan for Sandstorm, it'd be possible to test Sandstorm features on it. (There's more I'd like to do, like enabling access to the API and stuff. Someday hopefully using the Powerbox to move cards and lists between boards, etc.)\nIf I could package Wekan, I'd be more than happy to work with anyone who needs help implementing Sandstorm features, like a separate \"Import board\" flow.. Did you try meteor-spk dev and using the app locally in dev mode? Does that work?\nAlso, did you do anything with the pgpSignature in there? It signs the app key, and so if you didn't re-sign the app, Sandstorm may think the SPK is invalidly signed. I don't know if that would cause that error or not, mind you.\nBut whereas packing and unpacking SPKs cares about keys and signing, dev mode does not, so is a good first place to start.. One note: The appVersion must always be higher, but it doesn't matter if they get skipped. It's just an ordinal integer. The app market will reject an appVersion equal to or lower than the published version. That, like the signing/appId stuff won't be of any material importance to people doing testing, since we'll make sure the metadata is all right before we publish.. I'm curious if @GhassenRjab is around and interested in tackling this issue in the near future, or if we should be trying to package Wekan for Sandstorm with import disabled so that all of the other new fixes and features can be pushed out.. Alright. Make sure all of the GPG metadata is changed to Wekan Team before publishing, as per David's request. (I would remove the Upstream Author line entirely from the package definition file.)\nWhen you use spk publish, it should check that everything squares up right before putting it in the experimental market at https://apps.sandstorm.io/?experimental=true\nWe can keep it available there until all of the important issues are all tested, upon which we can release it to everyone else.. FWIW, it may be worth summarizing the standing issues for Wekan on Sandstorm and then determining whether or not those are blocking issues. I know in my case, images being imported isn't a big deal, very few of the Trello/Wekan boards I've ever used had any.\nRegarding the Copy URL of a card feature, the issue there is that Sandstorm doesn't give the grain's URL to the app.. Any issues following the instructions in the publishing guide, just let me know.. As a note, there's an experimental Sandstorm release of Wekan here: https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h?experimental=true\nPlease run some tests (be safe, don't kill your production server), and let us know if things look good. We know there are some issues still, but it should be by and large a major step up from the last Wekan release on Sandstorm.. Yes.\n\n. In Ports in Progress, you should see a lot of contacts because there are a lot of members of the board. When you click add, you should see the list is longer than your Wekan screen, and if your cursor is over the list, and you scroll using the scroll wheel, it will scroll down below Wekan in a considerably strange manner.. Actually, by the way, I realized this is not a Powerbox issue, since Powerbox is only for adding users to the board. This may actually work in standalone Wekan, though you need a board with a lot of members to test it.. @xet7 Note that re: CLAs, more often than not, it's primarily substantial contributors you want to worry about. People adding major features like this ideally should have signed a CLA. People fixing typos need not bother.. @papoola It's at https://www.clahub.com/agreements/wekan/wekan. The checkbox when creating a new custom field to show fields on cards seems to have no discernable effect. I tried out custom fields with and without that checkbox and they seemed to behave the same either way.. I can confirm the #1649 issue on 1.01 on Sandstorm. This issue can probably be closed now.. So, here's my question: What functionality is this field supposed to have? Would it not make more sense to instead focus on the more general \"custom field\" feature in #802?\nOr will this tie into some larger project management view, where one can lay out the tasks, prerequisites, and time required?. @jLouzado David is primarily only involved in Sandstorm.io fixes for Wekan. Developers who are working on this repository will certainly notice the PR when they have time.. @genecraig This is an open source project. Nobody makes any money to work on it. The fact that you have the ability to create Wekan boards for free is something you should be appreciative of. If you'd like to contribute, do so. If you'd like to offer up money on here for someone to write a feature you want, someone might be interested in taking you up on that even.\nBut coming in to comment on the \"absurdity\" that a feature you want isn't in a program that you didn't pay for or contribute to in any way is, in fact, absurd. :). I actually get notifications of all Wekan issues and comments in my email, I read them all and sometimes I respond. I am not following your juvenile rear anywhere, though I find it at least mildly entertaining to read to kind of nonsense you're typing.\nThis is not a business. Nobody's talking about who's what intellectual property. This is a free, open source thing for your use if you want it. If you don't want it, don't use it. The people who bother to support or work on this project are people who use it, and benefit from improvements to it, and that's the only reason they're here.\nPlease stop using GitHub as your whining platform. Go whine elsewhere. GitHub comments is for productive discussion, not whining about how you want people to work for you for free.. As a note for @xet7, if the settings here are limited to the ones listed above, the admin panel should probably just not be displayed for Sandstorm users, as none of these settings would apply to them.. @xet7 Do you know how this appears (hopefully doesn't) in Sandstorm yet? This will be the one thing we need to test for rc2 in Sandstorm, I think.. @frmwrk123 FWIW, I test releases submitted to the Sandstorm App Market, so my feedback will always come after a release, not a PR. Nothing I commented on here is a release-blocking issue, I'm just throwing out some feedback for possible future improvements.. @max-marschall's determination explains why I had a hard time replicating the lost checklist items when testing. I only had a few checklist items I had created ahead of upgrading to test with, and I did, indeed, pretty quickly lose all of them.. If it's possible to add a migration that prevents data loss when moving existing checklists, that'd be really worthwhile, IMHO.. @GhassenRjab That would probably also fix the bug in this version of Wekan where trying to sort a checklist item which existed before the update causes it to vanish.\nIf it's possible for someone to fix this, I'd rather wait for that to be fixed before pushing the update to Sandstorm, so we don't have a glitch that causes data loss.. Is anyone willing to tackle a fix that adds the sort attribute to checklists that don't have it? I just want to know whether or not I should continue to hold the Sandstorm version for a fix.. Reviewing 0.41 is now on my todo list.. @tenetor3 I suspect that @xet7 is going to instruct you to please submit translations via Transifex.. @urslan All translations are supposed to be submitted via Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/. The next release of Wekan should include all of the translation updates pulled from Transifex.. @stephenmoloney Yes, the double slash bug is because of the published version of kadira:flow-router. The patched version is in the Wekan organization on GitHub.. Does not happen on Firefox.. Does not happen on Firefox.. Correction on reproduction steps:\n\nOpen the keyboard shortcut list.\nClick off of the keyboard shortcut list to get rid of it.\nDelete a checklist.. Does NOT happen if you close the keyboard shortcut list with the X. Does happen if you close the keyboard shortcut list by clicking elsewhere on the screen.. Still does not happen on Windows Firefox with new reproduction steps. So pretty confident now this is an Edge-specific quirk.. @JamborJan Can you run these through tinypng? https://tinypng.com/\n\nboard_view_01.png shrinks from 405 KB to 129 KB. Since SPK metadata has a 1 MB limit, not optimizing these images may cut very close or go over that limit.. I would definitely be in favor of seeing the comment-only permission make it to Sandstorm at some point.. This is really a case of https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-app-market/issues/100 rather than an issue for Wekan to solve.\nBut this is how you do it for all apps in the Sandstorm App Market:\n1. Go to the app's page on the market: https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h\n2. Click \"Install\". You probably need a Sandstorm server to appear here to do this, so you can add oasis.sandstorm.io or really any other URL as a Sandstorm server here.\n3. Copy the URL from the Install on x server link, like this: https://oasis.sandstorm.io/install/5a4a7ae7adbcc0876bdab2b0216d6152?url=https://app-index.sandstorm.io/packages/5a4a7ae7adbcc0876bdab2b0216d6152\n4. Grab the part of that URL after the url=, like this: https://app-index.sandstorm.io/packages/5a4a7ae7adbcc0876bdab2b0216d6152\n5. That link will download the SPK file, though you may have to add the .spk to it.\nThose are actually Wekan's URL's, so the last link will download the latest Wekan SPK as of this posting, but let me know if you have any questions about this workaround.. Translations must be submitted through Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/. Same as Sandstorm, pretty much a hard no.. @mfshiu That version of Wekan is nearly two years old. You are going to have a LOT of problems if you aren't planning on updating to the current version of Wekan. There are not only a lot of bugs and security issues in older versions, but you're missing major features.. The owner of a Sandstorm grain can download a backup of the grain from the top bar. I definitely would like to see an automated version at some point of this feature though. You can also back up the entire Sandstorm server, and probably restore the grain contents in the file system, but that would likely be hacky and somewhat unsupported.\nping @kentonv. I'd propose closure of this issue because it's a Sandstorm issue, not a Wekan issue. Related issues are:\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/1324\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/1647. There are no known issues with Trello at the present time. (There was a long time ago, but it was resolved before this project was even called Wekan.). As far as I personally know, I don't think there's any claims beyond the MIT license covering the repository. \"Wekan\" as a brand/name might be trademarked, but I don't see a mark for that. Maybe @mquandalle could answer.\nOut of curiosity, is there some reason Wekan itself doesn't meet your Trello-like needs?. Are you referring to https://github.com/mnutt/davros ? Because this issue doesn't sound like it has anything to do with Wekan.. It sounds like this might be your issue: https://github.com/mnutt/davros/issues/87. @huneau I would note for the future that disabling a feature as important as export really shouldn't happen in a release version, IMHO.. I am not a maintainer, but I don't see why you couldn't add sections on that page for Installing and Updating directly below the relevant Sandstorm versions. (Sandstorm should probably be listed above probably solely because it is currently the recommended distribution for certain needs like integration with corporate LDAP or ADFS schemes which Wekan doesn't support directly. I know Cloudron provides it's own LDAP, but I do not recall if it can connect to existing corporate authentication schemes.)\nDirect support of LDAP in Wekan (see #119) is actually a really big longstanding request, by the way, if that was something you were able to upstream, you would probably have a lot of fans from the Wekan community. ;). It's a pretty community-oriented project over here, as long as your edit is nice and clean, you should just be able to edit the wiki.. Looks great, @nebulade !. @xet7 meteor-spk 0.3.2 (current) supports Meteor 1.4. Shouldn't be any concerns for Sandstorm.. @Reneeeee I can tag @dwrensha here about that, but the main reason the Sandstorm package lags behind is there's extra work in packaging it, and everything needs to be tested that it works correctly inside the Sandstorm sandbox.\nSandstorm's packaged version is arguably the most secure way to use Wekan between the general sandboxing behavior, and that there are security bugs that have been introduced to Wekan and fixed since the last Sandstorm package.. @xet7 I doubt #1105 would affect Sandstorm. Only users who have been shared access to the Wekan grain can access files within it due to the Sandstorm sandbox. And since each grain contains only a single board (of which everyone it's shared with can at least view it), I do not think it would be possible for unauthorized users to access that data within Sandstorm.. @xet7 I wouldn't release a new version that non-Sandstorm users update to if that bug is introduced by the current version. I assume that we still need David to publish new Sandstorm releases at this time?. Got it. For some reason I thought it was introduced with the API or something like that.\nSome would argue the file URL's being unguessable is good enough security to begin with for most users. If they are, in fact, unguessable, the only problem is that one a user who has access has the URL, they can share it with others, and you can't revoke that user's access to that URL even if you remove them from the Wekan board. That's a very specific risk.. Tagging @dwrensha because he is the keeper of the keys on publishing this, AFAIK.. @gerroon My understanding is the issue was with the extension, Stylish. And I think there's an open source alternative, called Stylus, which doesn't have that issue. But I agree, I am not fond of extensions which can mess with page content, and don't use them myself.. Your number (2) approach would basically be to ensure everything you want to be able to do in Wekan can be done via the API. Then all you need is people to write plugins for things like Huginn to do them. That's probably a smarter approach than overloading Wekan with all the sorts of functionality an IFTTT-like program would have.. 0.32 has some issues in Sandstorm that need to get resolved before it can be published for Sandstorm. @xet7 and I have actually been working on getting everything sorted to actively publish a new release for Sandstorm over the last couple of weeks.. You can keep an eye on where we're at right now on #799 . I am going to FYI tag @kentonv on this so he can consider it in questions about how apps should reference themselves, which comes up from time to time. Might be a good use for an offer template-like interface where the app code never sees the URL but presents it to the user.. I think it's safe to say most people expect a link they send someone will give them access to something, so I'd agree that /shared// is the way to go there.. This is unlikely to be fixed in the new Sandstorm release. Basically what happens here is Wekan can't see the sharing permissions that Sandstorm has, and adds a user when it first sees them (because Sandstorm permits them to connect). However, when their sharing permission is revoked on Sandstorm, they simply never get to connect to Wekan again, and Wekan has no way to know they have been dropped. (Note that this also explains why the \"Remove from Board\" option is gone in Wekan on Sandstorm: If they were just removed from Wekan's list, Sandstorm would still permit them access and they'd be re-added when they visit again.)\nI would guess the ideal case would be for Sandstorm's API to offer some sort of callback when a user is removed from the sharing permissions to let Wekan know that user can be dropped from that view. I do not think that currently exists, and I'll tag @kentonv here so that he sees this, though I doubt this will be resolved soon.. @rautamiekka That would be particularly bad from a security standpoint, since Sandstorm would be allowing a banned user inside the sandbox. A critical benefit of using Sandstorm to manage your apps is that no security vulnerability in the app can even be exploited by a user who isn't granted permission to access an app through Sandstorm.. It would be far better for a removed user to still be visible in the UI, but definitely unable to access any data, then for a removed user to not be visible in the UI, but possibly still be able to access data.. Hmmm... What we could do, if you really wanted, is re-enable the remove action, but with a warning that must be clicked through before removing them, which informs them that while this will remove them from appearing in Wekan, they need to revoke that user's access in Sandstorm, or else they may still be able to access the board.. Not a problem.\nAnd yeah, I've kinda thought about it, and it seems like people are more concerned with not seeing the removed accounts in Wekan: They generally have already removed them or unshared the grain with them in Sandstorm. So making the removal option available in Wekan would be okay... as long as we clearly communicate with the user that removing them there is just taking them off the list, not revoking access.. If it only happens with one grain, my guess is something in the Mongo database for that grain is corrupted. I don't know enough about Mongo to suggest how to fix it. But presumably, if you opened up the grain backup, fixed the Mongo database, then re-zipped it and uploaded the grain back to Sandstorm, it would work.. This appears to be an accidental/improper submission.. This also appears to be an accidental/improper submission.. Beyond being a little mystified why anyone would intentionally apply Material to something... like... intentionally...\nThere has been some work on an API for Wekan, though right now I believe it has a single authentication capability with admin-like ability, so users can't really use it. Presumably the ideal thing would be to expand the capabilities of this API so that users can easily get the appropriate access rights to their boards over it, and then build third party apps on that API.\nI have no idea how much would need to be changed to use Meteor Client Bundler. Presumably if there isn't a lot (any?) code change to the server side required to use it, you could just... point your client at the Wekan install? I suspect either way, you're going to have to learn how Meteor works in order to implement this. The primary thing your client needs to be able to consume is the Meteor DDP: https://blog.meteor.com/introducing-ddp-6b40c6aff27d. Having a good \"official\" way to built clients for Wekan is probably a really good idea, since mobile apps are commonly requested. Though I am not sure that requires separating the Wekan web UI from the server components.. Quirks:\n\nSomehow I managed to overwrite a checklist item by dragging and lost a couple that way while rapidly playing with this.\nYou cannot drag into a checklist that has no existing items. So, if you have two lists, you can be dragging around, drag them all into one list, and before you are able to drag them back into the other list, you have to manually add an item to that list so dragging works again.. This is probably a CC: @frmwrk123 thing.. Also worth noting is that the existing Wekan logo appears to be a custom typeface, which makes it uniquely distinct. The proposed replacements look like standard typefaces.\n\nThe full size logos would make it appear the pattern of three colored boxes is the \"icon\", but Nena's icon more properly represents lists of cards, I think.. Any updated logo should probably come as a comprehensive set that replaces the full-width logo and the icons in varying sizes: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/meta/icons as the different sizes serve various functions in Sandstorm, and can be used in other purposes as small, medium, and large icons to represent the software.. @rhelsing yeah, #64 covers just about every possible question or concern, mostly because the old LibreBoard to-do was coming out of a complete redesign due to a Trello DMCA. So making sure everything including typeface are on solid legal ground is pretty key.\nI think the gradient and bordering on the original logo is kinda mediocre, I'd support it being flattened out a bit. Note that an AI file for that logo does exist somewhere. (Nena has it, according to the old discussion, but I assume would not release it without Maxime's say so.). I would say between the Sandstorm icons (which are the majority of the way I see Wekan branding) and the fact that the default Wekan board is blue, I closely associate Wekan with it's blue-ish hue. I'd expect most Wekan logos to be blue-on-white or white-on-blue.. @neynah If you are willing to shoot a copy of the source files for existing logos/icons you have to xet7, that'd be pretty great, since he's currently the maintainer of this project and probably should have access to such things at minimum.. This should be fixed already when the next release comes out: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1226. Hmm... next question is: Does it work on non-Sandstorm Wekan. If someone can test that, it will help narrow down where the bug is.. So, to be clear, the current issue (which I expect is the same in Sandstorm and non-Sandstorm builds?) is that non-admins can see the create label button?\n@remcooverweg If the issue is fixed in Wekan, it will generally make it to Sandstorm shortly thereafter. We do a little extra testing before approving updates to the Sandstorm version.. I don't see a huge reason not to let normal users create labels, other similar software does.\nIf a change is made to Wekan to allow it, the change should correctly occur in Sandstorm as well, once it makes it into a release.. I'm guessing this is also the lack of the sort attribute on old checklists.\nIs 2.20 the version Cloudron's numbering scheme? A Wekan version should look like 0.37. If you try and reorder a checklist item that existed pre update it will disappear.\nI suspect with your issue there might be something in the browser's JS console when you try the action that's failing for you?. Thank you for tackling this bug, @GhassenRjab!. This is weird on Sandstorm because it affects the main Activity feed on the right sidebar at the same time as it affects the card, despite the slider only being visible on individual cards.\nI also recommend changing the CSS here: Wekan is not a Material Design app, and the #6fbeb5 color choice doesn't match any Wekan UI. If you must with a hardcoded color here, I'd ask for something in Wekan's usual color palette, but this element should use the board color setting that affects all other Wekan colored elements. (I'm happy to file this as a separate bug.). This issue was not fixed in 0.55 on Sandstorm.\n\n. I do not see a huge need for Sandstorm to support an option in the board menu. I would argue the default behavior should be for admins and normal users to create and edit labels, and if an option is absolutely needed to disable it for normal users (I am dubious of the benefits of this option), I think a top menu level selection for it is excessive.\nEventually if we want to expose more advanced options to Sandstorm users for each board, we'd want like a board-level mini-admin panel type thing. But in the short term I would just change the behavior for all users, IMHO.\nI'm not testing this change in Sandstorm because I'm too lazy to create another user account, but it's a trivial change that looks good as-is.. @JavGuerra Wekan handles changes to translations through Transifex. You should make your changes there: https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/. Beautiful.. Is the WIP Limit number supposed to be editable? Because it is not. If I wanted to set the limit of the above to 10, I'd need to add eight more cards first, as the text field autopopulates with the number of cards in the list and cannot be incremented.. I've created a separate issue for this problem with more detail and tagged you.. I noticed that the Python script pulls from Selenium. I get the impression he is actually instructing Selenium to open the full Wekan grain and operating it in an automated fashion. It's definitely vastly preferable to query the API.\nThis is probably the documentation you're looking for, if you haven't seen this already: https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/http-apis/. @ertanalytics Did you test with 1.33 on Oasis or 1.34?. Also, since you tested with the pre-SandstormApi change version, test out the API too and let me know if it behaves differently. I wanted to do some testing myself but I've been really busy of late and don't know how much time I have to devote to side projects at the moment.. Hm..... what if you remove the /api from your request URL, @xet7?\nI'm wondering if setting apiPath to /api makes it add it to the URL, which would be /api/api. If this is true, we can change the apiPath to / to fix this.. To clarify, I had meant to tell you to try the request WITHOUT the part of the URL, as I think my change is adding it.\nSent from my Windows 10 phone\nFrom: Lauri Ojansivu\nSent: Tuesday, September 4, 2018 5:57 PM\nTo: wekan/wekan\nCc: Jacob Weisz; Mention\nSubject: Re: [wekan/wekan] Error when logging in to Wekan REST API when usingSandstorm Wekan (#1279)\n@ocdtrekkie\n/api/api and /api/api/api did not work. I try modifying js file.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. My understanding is that the change xet7 made to un-break this is in the current version of Wekan, which I've approved to the app market. Note that before packages are approved, they can be found at https://apps.sandstorm.io/?experimental=true. I still don't think there's any Sandstorm bugs with the API at present. I don't think the API has ever worked really correctly on the Sandstorm version.\n@ertanalytics When there's no experimental app available, the experimental market stays on \"loading\". It's a known issue with the market because the experimental market is kinda a hack. https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-app-market/issues/98. I understand in stating this that my suggestion may not work with the full multi-board Wekan, so if this isn't a simple fix or a fix that makes sense without adding a lot of hackery, feel free to leave it be. But I felt like I should document the oddity here.. This brings up a lot of questions how to properly handled this. Replacing the username of ever deleted user with say \"deleted user\" leaves a lot of conversations indecipherable. Most sites I recall will leave the username there permanently.. \"The problem is that we could now have Wekan instances where users where deleted\" <- The problem with not having a stable branch. :/. But yeah, I think the ideal case would be to replace the deletion method with one that retains the user table data but marks them deleted and hides them from places they should be deleted. @ tagging, the sidebar, etc. Where their username is display, possibly check for deletion and then grey out their name or something.. I'd be pretty curious how GDPR actually affects Wekan. Is it mostly based on personal information (of which Wekan likely has little of)? What are you allowed to not delete? Like, can we change a user ID to be their username, and an isDeleted flag, and then dump stuff like their passwords, email addresses, etc.?. @xet7 I guess my question is though, is in a given Wekan board, what data is \"the user's\"? And who is \"the user\"? Isn't the Wekan board admin the user? Does \"the user's data\" include any card they added to a Wekan board, or is that now the property of the board admin?. Looks like an accidental PR.. From what I can currently determine, the buttons do appear for me in Firefox, but do not appear for me in Edge. And note that when you click on the number, you get a flashing cursor in the box, yet cannot change said number.. Note that from the screenshot in #1278 added by @xet7, whatever browser he is using does not show the buttons either.. @nztqa That's interesting. And kind of unpleasant. :/\nMy impression though is that it shouldn't prevent one from editing the number directly though in the field. (I wasn't even expecting up/down buttons, I was mystified why the textbox wasn't editable.). @nztqa I noticed at the top of the MDN: \"The browser may opt to provide stepper arrows\", indicating that Edge is not technically wrong (although it'd be nice if they added it). It appears the onkeydown attribute is what's blocking this from being edited, so I created #1312 to remove it, as it seems to lack a constructive purpose.. So still ccing @amadilsons , I may have cause an... intriguing new bug. Now it's editable, and if you expand and collapse the WIP limit once or twice, it DOES get the current card number set in the WIP limit field... but the first time you enable the WIP limit on a list, it says 0 instead of the number of cards in the list.. Actually, nope, it wasn't me. Same thing happens sometimes on 0.51. No idea why.. @amadilsons When I tried to enable a WIP limit on a list with several cards, the value 0 showed up with a red border around the box because it was too small. Clicking to disable the WIP Limit and then again to enable it again caused the box to properly populate with the number of cards in that list.. I assume this will not work in Sandstorm. Is the option appropriately hidden for Sandstorm users?. @thuanpq Because a lot of us use it on Sandstorm, even if you don't. And a lot of features Wekan doesn't directly support like LDAP and SAML login integration are available via Sandstorm.\nNote that the fix to make this not break Sandstorm took @GhassenRjab a few minutes... if a change isn't Sandstorm compatible, we can just disable that feature in Sandstorm, as the last commit has done.. If someone wants to add support for this feature in Sandstorm later, they can, but again, that doesn't slow down development of Wekan at all.. @thuanpq If you are inquiring about your own PR, bear in mind that your last comment a week ago said that you would update it. Commits don't generate notifications, so @xet7 may not have known your PR was ready for review. It is helpful after making any changes to your PR to make another comment indicating it's readiness. :). @symphonyxrv More than likely, whenever you see 0.56 release, in the next couple weeks. There's no set schedule, as xet7 maintains this project in his spare time.. Translation work needs to be done via Transifex.. Please make your changes at: https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/\nNote how Wekan handles translations: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Translations\n@xet7 Is it possible to like, get a bot that automatically responds to i18n PRs?. Can we perhaps get a clear list of blocking issues on running with the latest Node and Mongo? I definitely don't want to lose the regular Sandstorm release cadence for long, and getting these issues sorted would go a long way to resolving other regular issues with Wekan like people using the wrong Mongo version.\nI'd be happy to pitch in some bounty money to get these resolved.. Interesting note from Meteor's repo: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/9396\n3.4.x doesn't support 32-bit, and Meteor is going to support 3.2.x for 32-bit and 3.4.x for 64-bit. This change was merged 19 days ago and is presumably scheduled for Meteor 1.7.. It would probably be best to figure out what's wrong with newer Node versions outside of Sandstorm, so you have the full suite of debugging options you're used to. At the end of the day, all Sandstorm's log is telling you there is it can't load the web interface, and hence, after 30 seconds, is assuming something's wrong.. Given the changes, I'm guessing it's in 6.12.1 you found an issue, not 6.12.2, which just updates OpenSSL.\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V6.md#6.12.2. Whatever is in that issue worked on 6.12.1, and not on 7.x. So that can't be your issue with upgrading to 6.12.1.. Would this be like cards with checklists that have all items checked? What are 'done' cards.\nWekan already has archived cards, so I guess the feature you want here is a way to tell the cards to auto-archive after a point.. So what you'd want is a way to specify an auto-archive timer that could be set on a column. (Since you can name any given column anything.) Also, and I don't know if Wekan does this, you'd need Wekan to know how long it's been in that specific list, as opposed to the card's overall age.. Out of curiosity, do you archive cards which are done? (ex. #1335 ). The notion that xet7 commits fail the CLA is hilarious, as a sidenote. Is it possible to submit the PR without the extra commits though?. Given how many SMTP related issue filings I've seen, and the fact that every other tool I've used that includes SMTP config includes a button to test it, I am 100% in favor of this PR.. I am not super fond of this change. It takes up like an inch and a half, since the current \"Add attachment\" button is a giant box. It pushes the most recent comment to nearly always be below the scroll point.\nIs it possible we could shorten how large this section is if there's no attachments, while still making the Attachments section visible all the time?. I understand why. But as someone who rarely uses attachments in Wekan, the change has a very painful cost. I am not personally comfortable trying to improve it myself, but hoping perhaps my suggestion on how it can be improved might be useful to the person who made the PR.. Intriguing. I can definitely create new boards with Wekan 0.60 on Sandstorm Oasis.. Not usually, but I just double checked that it worked on Sandstorm Alpha for new boards as well.\nHmm... the usual is try a different browser and such. I have a new Wekan build to review and release, which might fix it, if it's something wrong with the package on your system.. If you want, I've rudimentarily checked that 0.62 both works on new grains and existing grains: https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h?experimental=true. Each grain has it's own mongodb. If you download a grain backup, the log for it might be in there somewhere, if it saves it. It's hard to even picture what could be causing your issue.\ncc: @kentonv I am baffled, if you happen to notice this tag, and have any ideas.. @xarinatan I can at least say this may be the most intriguing bug report yet, so by all means, keep us up to date.. I don't think Wekan should auto-perma-delete anything. Email auto-deletes from trash, but that makes sense given the volume of email people get. No operating system would delete your files automatically though, no matter how long they're in the trash.\nArchive does lend itself to mean something you're likely to keep historically, and Recycle Bin/Trash suggests you are getting rid of it, but unless there's a difference in functionality, arguing about which to use is more or less bikeshedding.. I definitely remember it working, but schema changes effectively break it every time Wekan adds a new feature.. @xet7 When you are testing with older versions of the Sandstorm package, are you also testing with importing/exporting from similarly old Wekan versions?. Specific details I figured out:\n\n\nThe swimlane is not created on a new board.\n\n\nUpgraded boards seemed to more or less work and had a default swimlane.\n\n\nUpgraded boards defaulted to swimlane view, even though previous boards obviously did not use swimlanes.\n\n\nNo matter what name you gave a swimlane, the feed on the right column didn't correctly retrieve the name of the swimlane being archived.. Some of these and other issues are fairly noticeable right now to the non-swimlane user, I don't want to push 0.76 to the main market, but we can leave it on the experimental market for testing until we have a cleaner build.. Does non-Sandstorm Wekan also default to Swimlane view? And is that preferred? Shouldn't it start in Lists, and then a user can switch a board into Swimlanes?. It looks like Swimlane view is default both for new and upgraded grains, I got confused because you click on Swimlanes to switch to Lists, and click on Lists to switch to Swimlanes, which is very confusing.\n\n\nOn upgraded grains, it looks like there's a Default Swimlane that all existing cards are in, though its name appears \"undefined\" when you archive it. New grains do not have or show a Swimlane, and you need to switch to Lists to do anything with Wekan.. This issue and #1506 constitute all the things I currently see as a blocker to approving the update for everyone. And realistically, if we at least switch the default view back to Lists, that's probably good enough until Swimlanes is fixed.. This is just overall notes on my testing of the latest Sandstorm build. Not knowing which is Sandstorm-only and which is general, I didn't want to so spreading issues or comments everywhere. :) And then I opened 1506 because it was a problem with Lists view.\nThe default view being Swimlanes vs. Lists is probably the one I'd say isn't really covered anywhere, and probably a topic of discussion that I am not sure is Sandstorm specific or not.. @xet7 Drop into List view, and you should be able to add lists, and then cards.. Oh, you're right, the Add button isn't clickable!. TypeError: Swimlanes.findOne(...) is undefined is the JavaScript console error I see when I try and hit the add button, so this is probably a \"Default swimline not created\" issue.. Specifically, probably what would be ideal is that Wekan boards should open in List view, until someone adds a second Swimlane. Then it should probably open in Swimlane view.. Thank you. This was easily my biggest concern with getting updated builds pushed to Sandstorm again.. I don't even know what fibers does. I just know that I hate it.. I was seeing very similar on Sandstorm with the latest versions, the scroll bar is no longer properly attached to the bottom of the window.. I can go ahead and approve 0.78 if you like, @xet7.\nI am still curious about this issue because it doesn't sound like an issue I think 0.63 has. Is it possible to download a backup of this Sandstorm grain and send it to one of us?. Done, though, as I said, I am not sure it will fix the issue the OP is having. @teras, update the app, try it again, let us know.. I just experienced this issue. While I was able to workaround it by editing the label directly on the card, when drag and drop is working, it's definitely preferred. I would argue this issue should be reopened because it is definitely a bug and it still exists, it just probably isn't super critical to fix.. Import/export is currently broken, but if you're going from Sandstorm to Sandstorm, you actually don't need to use it. The grain owner can download a backup of the grain using the download icon on the top bar of Sandstorm, and you can restore the grain to the new server with the Restore grain button on the Grains tab.. This isn't explicit to admin panel, if your Wekan isn't wide enough in general (especially if you have a Sandstorm frame eating some of the width), it does this.\n\n. The best way to request features is to open a separate issue for each one (as long as there isn't already an issue open requesting that feature!). Then any given feature request can be discussed or found easily.\nWelcome to the Wekan community though, and anything you do offer up contribution-wise will surely be appreciated. :). @DrCuriosity That's more or less the beef, yes. Can you confirm your Wekan version?. @zebby76 You may want to try submitting this without all the merge commits.. It isn't possible currently to remove them from appearing on Wekan on Sandstorm. The reason being is that Wekan grains cannot see if you have removed them on Sandstorm. If Wekan allowed you to remove them, it would be possible for you to believe you removed them, while they may still have permission to access the board on Sandstorm.. This is a duplicate of #1192.. Currently not. I just proposed a possible option in the existing issue, if you want to subscribe to that issue report, you'll get notifications on any further discussion.. Whoa, cool.\nI think this has to do with the fact that your Lists/Swimlanes button in your screenshot is currently returning \"null\" up there in the top right. It seems however you're getting here, Wekan doesn't know which view the user prefers and is showing no view at all.\nThis was probably introduced in the migration of the Lists/Swimlanes behavior moving from being board-based to user-based.. Yeah, I owe you some app approvals there. I just did my last major homework assignments for my current course tonight, so this weekend is looking good. :)\nI am a little concerned about adding more bloat to the interface (given that the Sandstorm interface is also there), but there's not inherently anything wrong with moving in that direction. In an example: One of Sandstorm's Git apps has been modified to only permit one repo, and another allows multiple repos in a grain.\nThis may take some reworking of permissions though: Sandstorm is going to expect that everyone in a given grain has the permissions Sandstorm is giving it, whereas Wekan boards might have different permissions. This would confuse people, and reduces the security benefit of Sandstorm, since a Wekan bug could let someone with access to one board get to another board in the same grain.\nI also don't think having the admin panel is a bad thing, it would just require some rearrangement of where you check for Sandstorm, since some admin panels will never make sense in Sandstorm, you probably want to hide them. (I feel Rocket.Chat can be a bit confusing because it's whole admin panel shows up in Sandstorm, but many of the options do not work.). That's gotta pertain to how Wekan handles the new board/list view setting being user-specific. You've got to figure out what Wekan considers an anonymous Sandstorm viewer, and assign them a default view. What does Wekan standalone do when someone views the board without signing in?. AFAIK, non-signed in users used to be able to see boards from sharing links without signing in. But we'd have to pull a version of the SPK from before the board/list view being profile-specific to test that.\nI would consider anywhere something comes back as \"null\" to be a bug.. sandstorm.js is supposed to force Wekan to public mode, since the security is enforced by Sandstorm itself.\nSee here: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/sandstorm.js#L317. This isn't a permission issue, AFAICT.. Essentially, it's the same problem that was fixed here: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/c4b898633e1c959f51815ee93a354a093f1139b6 but for Sandstorm anonymous users.. @andresmanelli Was curious if you might have any insight on where we can apply the board view to fix this, since you fixed a similar bug.. @ChronikEwok You indeed have a very solid understanding of the issue. And my impression is Wekan should default to list view if a user hasn't selected otherwise. For the first issue, I'd definitely like to see that fix.\nFor the second one, my guess is \"return false\" needs to be an option because a function named currentCardIsInThisList should be able to return in the negatory if the current card is in some other list.. WOW. This one's been out here a long time. Thanks @ChronikEwok !. This is a duplicate of #1603 (filed by the same user and still open). Note that these issues are very similar to #1623, which I believe we know is not fixed as of the current version.. It is probably a fairly simple fix. This sort of thing can be an easy oversight when adding new elements to boards or cards such as the just-added custom fields. (It may be good to document a list of these features that need to be checked for compatibility when adding new fields. Import/export is the usual victim.). It'd be the browser-policy Meteor package. It's likely configurable.. https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/browser-policy. I, uh, think you messed up your PR, since it deletes all of the language files.. @sorbet510 Each board on Sandstorm is a separate running copy of Wekan, which provides a significant additional layer of security. Unfortunately, it makes doing things like inter-board transfer fairly complicated, so it isn't possible right now.. It is technically possible to do it, I just don't want to get anyone's hopes up saying \"it's coming\", because it would require someone with good understanding of the internals of Sandstorm to spend a bunch of time working on Wekan code. And that's not likely anytime soon.. There's definitely no card limit, but I am quite curious what would be wrong here. Is there confidential information in this board you would be unable to send someone to test against? When the grain is open, there's a download button on the top bar to take a backup of the Sandstorm grain. It's likely your information is still there, but just cannot be viewed for some reason.. This is a known issue relating to #1623. I just wanted to say I am super excited someone is working on tests for Wekan.. I fixed two typos in it. :D. This may help towards #1279. I honestly had no idea what these buttons were supposed to do based on the label. If they require connecting multiple boards, it would probably be best to hide them on Sandstorm.. I am reasonably confident 2.01 works fine for these features, as I use them and am currently using 2.01 myself on Sandstorm. 2.09 is available on the Experimental Market[1] (I haven't tested it), but since I know I don't have this issue on 2.01, I kind've doubt 2.09 will help.\nWhat browser are you using, and what is your Sandstorm version?\n[1] https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h?experimental=true. Should probably mention, it's on the experimental market, at the moment, which is here: https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h?experimental=true. As a note, for Wekan on Sandstorm to be able to use a Cron-like scheduler, Sandstorm needs to implement a Cron API (Unloved PR here: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/pull/2922) and then Wekan would need to implement it, so that the Sandstorm grain is awoken.. Subtasks doesn't work (creating one seems to happen then immediately disappears). I know Subtasks didn't work on Sandstorm before, so I'm not sure if it was disabled somehow.. https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/email-from-apps/. ",
    "neynah": "Thanks @ocdtrekkie \nHi all! I am the designer at Sandstorm.io. This is a very relevant discussion to me as I also found the existing LibreBoard logo on a Dribbble user's portfolio and decided that I should not use it to represent the app on Sandstorm. Here are the variations I have come up with (sharing for the first time).\nOption 1: New design altogether\n\nOption 2: Existing plain text logo (which I assume does not have copyright issues) with a nice gradient bg\n\nOption 3: I'm very much open to suggestions and am happy to volunteer my time to design something so we can get this on the new App Market ASAP. :)\n. @mquandalle I appreciate that. Perhaps we can wait a day or so to see what the consensus is. If you'd like to go with Wekan then I think we should publish the app under Wekan. The downside to publishing the app as LibreBoard with LibreBoard branding is that once it's updated to Wekan, it will be difficult to find/identify. Some users may think \"what happened to LibreBoard?\"\nIf you could share the source file for the logo I'd be happy to provide some square logo options based on what you have.\n. FWIW: when I and others at Sandstorm read \"WeKan,\" Jade said \"Oh, like a kanban board.\" I also made the same connection in my head and hadn't thought of Obama's campaign- though if it had the word \"Yes\" in front of it I definitely would have. Maybe this is different for others.\n@mquandalle  If we go with WeKan branding, we can always improve the graphics later. The important part(in the context of Sandstorm) is to have it in the App Market by Sunday so that it will be ready for Launch. However, if we get the SPK package sooner we will have time to test it thoroughly.\nFor the sake of time, I created a preview of the app graphics using the source file you sent me. I'll create a pull request shortly for 2 sets of graphics so that you'll have graphics available whether you decide to go with LibreBoard branding or Wekan branding.\n\n. Thanks @fjaguero !\nI also came up with a slight improvement for LibreBoard which I think is pretty cool- but my opinion is biased.\n\n. @mquandalle\nI rounded the edges of the square outlines to better match the type. My only issue with this is that \"We\" is not super legible due to the e being attached. But the source file has the entire type logo outlined so I won't be able to change that without some surgery. (But maybe you think it's OK as it is.)\n\n. @nata-goddanti I gave it a shot but I don't think the k flows as smoothly. (Probably because the typography wasn't originally designed for this.)\n\n. Thanks for all the feedback everyone. I'm in a rush so I went ahead and created PR #247 with the blue tron-like graphic sets for LibreBoard and Wekan. I exported for Sandstorm purposes but they're editable so feel free to play around with them for other purposes. If you're having trouble, let me know. :)\n@mquandalle we're excited to see this on the App Market soon! :D\n\n\n. Awesome to see this revisited. I'm not sure what the desired direction is for Wekan branding in general but @ocdtrekkie & @xet7 make a good point that whatever the new/improved logo is there should be a comprehensive set that's consistent and covers different uses. Let me know how I can help. I'm sure I can dig up the AI file.. wekan-logos.ai.zip\n\nIf you unclip the masks for the icons you'll be able to edit all the elements. Happy to help if anyone needs anything else.. Doesn't look exactly the same but maybe it's close enough. Let me know if this helps. (I could also do better to optimize the SVG file but it's not too bad.)\n\nwekan-1.svg.zip\n. wekan-1.ai.zip\n. ",
    "shekar73": "You know, when I am repeating this \"WeKan\"  in my head, the image I see is Obama's 2008 campaign slogan \"Yes we can\". I am not sure if it only me or rest of folks in US feel the same.

There is this french word that chefs use to organize the ingredients \"Mise en place\" , we can appropriate that word in some fashion and kind of make as a brand. Just my 2 cents...\n\n.

Also, it also important that from a privacy and data protection point of view I want to limit the searching and signups  that admin has provided access\n. My 2 cents would be  disabling the 'add a new card' , unless the team  thinks otherwise. My reasoning behind is, if as a user I see the link to add new card on the filtered result set and when I click that option with nothing happening on the form, then it might create bad experience.\n. That is true as well, having his familiar options would help smoother experience flow rather being 'stuck' and think about 'exit' options when he is on the filtered view.

I have a different take on this. Open source is all about taking the best of the ideas, cloning it and  extending it. Many open source projects came forth from business side and vice versa. Using a copyright and ethical framework to describe the project in black and white terms,  does not provide justice to the nature of the work put forth to develop the project in what is turning out to be the best open source kanban project. There are many projects that  Apache Foundation maintains that are clones of big projects from Google and Facebook. If Trello is so concerned about copyright I am sure they would have come forward to complain by now. In terms of the UI,  I don't think Trello is the original creator of using cards to display information, if one goes to the screen writing board of any big TV show there will be similar interface of using cards on the walls which is no different from Trello UI. Trello might be the  original inspiration for this project in terms look and feel but then every creative endeavor is an inspiration of some thing that came before, we should all applaud the main developers for coming forward, creating this project and extending it. If the look and feel being original,  is important then this is open source people can fork it and change the look and feel like they want, no one is stopping them to do!!!\n. I agree :+1: \n. @mquandalle early look of the design is looking much better. Actually much much better than Trello :smile:, which is now looking like meh.. compared to this.....\nI know this is very early design, but the dotted lines  between the lists are little distracting...\n. @bmathews  :+1:  it certainly looks soooooo much nicer....it feels so much simple, clear and elegant!\n. @mquandalle I vote for having the sidebar and @fnky and @Squ34k3rZ design fits well. If  I were to put  the users shoes  for a minute,  if I am working on a project,  I like my stream of activities and any changes made to the cards close by, so that the information can be accessed with no friction, rather than going to a overlay screen to access the information, which might lead to cognitive dissonance as I am breaking my train of thought, as the  app created an additional step to get to the information I need. The reason the sidebar works the way it works i guess, is very similar to how we all work, in the sense when we are working on a project we want to feel and see that the   necessary information for the project is close to us  and can easily get to it, with out taking any extra steps . Sometimes if something fits well in a absolute sense within the good usability   framework and solves a problem, then it is best to stick with it, regardless of who started it first. \n. @mquandalle  Actually from a color rhythm   point of view, I like @fnky design better. Having a main body with grey background and white cards(which is current WIP of @mquandalle ), while having a activity sidebar with  white background and grey boxes for activity and event text, creates a simple, clear contrast and makes it more elegant from a UI perspective, including how the members are displayed and added on the top of the activity section\n. I agree with @ocdtrekkie . @mquandalle  is a coding badass :smile: \n. @mquandalle Wondering from usability point of view, the header might get crowded if there many members (for example 10-15 members on one board). My opinion is, I like the current implementation state of the board but with sidebar component  as designed by @fnky (or maybe the sliding sidebar  might be a middle ground?)\n. @fix  :+1: :+1:  Love  the custom board backgrounds and chalk board metaphor in the home page!!\n. I agree having multiple checklists seemed redundant and so is the title. Most people are more concerned about identifying the items in the checklist than the title. In the checklist implementation-, \n-   When the new item needs to entered the previous item does not get emptied out. The previous item needed to be manually deleted to enter the new item\n- Pressing the enter key does not post the item on the item list. It would be nice to have this functionaility where pressing the enter key will post the item similar to how cards are posted.\n-  The space between the checklist title and completion bar seems to be too close. I guess if there is no checklist title this would be a non issue.\n. On second thoughts I think having multiple checklists along with title would be useful. Consider the scenario where a card is assigned to two members who are incharge of its completion and they each have sub-tasks they have to complete separately or they each have sub-tasks for acceptance criteria along with tasks that are actually done, like the ones suggested above (in which case there will be 4 checklists!!). \n. :+1:  @mquandalle ..Also cloning a card, list across boards as well. I beleive I saw this in the roadmap, but not really sure....\n. @mquandalle  when I am testing this issue, the cover seems to be working but loadin the attachments seems to be slow, I did a test of attaching a 459kb image and it has taken 7.84 seconds (out of which 6.50 seconds is the wait time) to , below is the screenshot.\n\nI added one more image 362 kb and it has taken 5.76 seconds. Below is the screenshot\n\nTo benchmark the time, I uploading an instance on meteor.com from my local repo (my instance is few weeks older) and below are the timings of the same images (1.58 seconds and 1.62 seconds)\n\nIt seems in the latest instance loading the attachments seems to be slower compared to the previous instances.\n. I tested one more time right now (around 10.45 pm PST) when the meteor.com is not at peak and I guess the images are loading much faster. Below is the screenshot. I guess it much be the issue of the of hosting server and not the app...\n\n. @dalareo , @mquandalle ...There is actually meteor specific package for sharejs - https://github.com/mizzao/meteor-sharejs\n. i agree :+1: \n. @mquandalle is there any ETA when the new UI will be back on github so that it can get contributions from the open source to leverage the existing active interest(>3500 stars!!)? I am assuming it is going to follow the model of open source for community contributions and paid model for some extra 'enterprisey' features, like gitlab? Is that a fair assumption?\n. I agree. This project has lot of potential. I only hope it does not end up in the open source deadpool due to the long delay!\n. :+1:  :+1:  :+1: \n. :+1: \n. I think we should not assume that the app would be used only by the sysadmins and in organizations. There are lot of use cases where wekan can be used for personal projects, game strategies or todo lists etc that do involve other people in some boards and in others they might not, so I think having basic admin interface with rules would be the better option to go...my 2 cents \n. As I was trying to debug the code, adding a new field in the board collection seems to be resolving the issue. So this is what I added to the board collection to match up the fields in   migrations. \n'background.type': {\n        type: String,\n        allowedValues: ['color']\n    },\n. Sure!! happy to do it..Thanks for the awesome work. I, for one  learning a lot from your work :-)\n. btw...this open issue might be related to this... https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/218\n. I am using Google Chrome.\n. That is weird.

Then, how about increasing the size to say 60 or 70 (or may be 100 as upper limit),  as most avatars fit in to that limit, till there is a reasonable solution in the community maintained package.\n. horka:swipebox\nswipebox-meteor\nSwipebox image viewer plugin for Meteor. \n(Swipebox is a responsive image viewer lightbox, that also works perfectly on mobile devices.) \nThis package is using the original swipebox plugin.\n. :+1:  I agree. I think sending the confirmation email  along with forgotten password email setup would remove that source of  spam or fraud. \n. Check this: \nhttps://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/190\n. check this: https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard/issues/190\n. Yep... I reproduced this bug on my side as well\n. As I mentioned earlier, to me when I pronounce we 'can'  I get  Obamas 2008 slogan\n \"Yes we can\"  in my head. May be it should be explicity stated in the release notes or github readme the how to pronounce  'wekan'  so that people know what is stands for ....\n. @thomasleveil ... I hear the same way when ever I repeat it in my head, about obamas slogan. But I see it as a good thing in that, it can be seen as a play on  words with two different meanings - 1.  it is showing middle finger to the establishment or to all the people who were complaining and railing due to the DMCA and saying that \"we can\" which is positive  2.  \"we kin\" as in \"we kan\"ban boards which is more literal meaning in functional sense.\nEither way, I think having a good story is always good for the project and brand and gives that sense of being underdog and gives that same level playing field as Trello....\n. Awesome ... :+1:  :+1: \n. :+1:  yep it is fixed. \n. :+1:  yep it is fixed. \n. :+1:  This is fixed\n. :+1:  This is fixed\n. :+1:  yep it is working ...\n. :+1:  :+1: \n. I tested this on the local instance and it seems to be working now. :+1: \n. Maybe having  roles defined in the admin page would get some quick wins to  solve lot of those user permissions issues....\nhttps://atmospherejs.com/alanning/roles\n. Yeah come to think of it that is true, I can see how allowing members to assign other members can be useful in some cases due to the project needs...\n. @mquandalle ...The reasoning seems solid and with the kind of muscle Facebook has, embracing react ecosystem is the way to go to make it future proof, as they seem to be controlling the current popular ideas in web/mobile development and  also increases the project's exposure to other React developers (as you mentioned). However, based on my understanding,  most of the packages in the meteor universe are closely tied to Blaze and I was wondering how is the impact going to be when using React?. \n. :+1:  :+1: \n. @mquandalle check this: https://forums.meteor.com/t/next-steps-on-blaze-and-the-view-layer/13561\nThere seems lot of discussion in regards to using React in Blaze 2 (either as templates on top or pure jsx).  My guess is MDG is going to integrate React in Blaze ASAP so that they can use Galaxy to host react based apps?  Wondering about your thoughts on this issue with reference to Wekan? Do you think we should start thinking of migrating as well ? \n. @mquandalle  I guess on reading it more clearly, MDG is replacing blaze with React and adding template support on top of React and some migration layer for an upgrade path. This would change the whole client side development of meteor app. Interesting!!!  Thoughts????\n. :+1:  :+1: \n. @floatinghotpot Question: Does this sizing dimensions apply only to Iphone devices or android phones as well?\n. @mquandalle  Is this going to be merged? I though the code review is already done?\n. Also, the sign-in and sign out pages are  not displaying properly on my Android Nexus 6P phone\n. @floatinghotpot  here you go....\nThese are the screenshots taken from my nexus 6p. I guess it might be the issue with how the language selection is displayed on the screen.\nscreenshot 1: before entering the user name.\n\nscreenshot2: when I start entering my user name\n\nscreenshot 3: when entering the password\n\nscreenshot4: after logging out\n\nHopefully these help.\nBTW, thanks for all that awesome contributions.  I am learning a lot from your  sick badassery contributions :smile: . \n. Yes I can confirm the same issue too. For me it mainly happens on the cards, you have to tap twice to get in to the card detail page. \n. Any ETA when this might be merged? \n. @mquandalle  I was thinking along the same lines as @floatinghotpot, who articulated it better than I could have. Below is my .02 cents:-). \nWhile having  cards with meta labels  abstracted to be used as proxy to lists is useful, in using as swimlanes and animation and can give a bird-eye view of the point in time awareness, I am not sure  it is possible to capture all of them in an abstract meta-model with the various permutations and combinations that go along in a real life project. It can easily get overly complicated because there can be so  many configurations and my concern is it might  lead to unintended consequences. \nLike, for example, if we use a meta-label tag of  \"Done\", and map it as  one of the  dimension,  its definition is different for different projects. For some some projects \"Done\" means done of the whole project, while in other projects \"Done\" means closure in one stage but it is still a continuation in the whole scheme of things and goes to different stage where it might be the beginning of the same project.  \nFor Example, if I have a project of writing and publishing a book, and I assign \"lists\" (or meta-labels) denoting each chapter, every chapter can have different 'done' stages that is defined by the author depending on his workflow. May be his workflow is taking each chapter  instead of the whole book.  Like, one task might be the  'outline of each chapter' and other task might be 'writing each chapter' and after he is 'done' writing he might send to 'editing' to a different person(who is doing his own tasks )  before taking on to the next chapter. Just this workflow  piece can have so many configurations that needs some kind  of  'task completion' 'progress' , 'review', 'notifications' etc. As you can see the flexibility will be lost if we provide anything that is pre-defined. I am assuming other projects can be as complicated, if not more. \nI mean it is a good idea  and I can see how just having 'cards' in 'projects' and using 'labels' as a meta for 'lists' is useful and can make it easy to map in to different stages and creating cool views. It can be made more 'specific' and I guess the biggest complaint against Trello is it is too general, so if we can be able to create the same flexibility using 'meta' notion of lists then it would prove to be really useful and I can see definite advantages in using it. But I really think it is going to be really hard to define all those configurations in an abstract meta model. \n. Yep...I have the same issue on my local instance\n. For whatever reason it seem to be working now on my local instance!!! \n. AFAIK it is not designed that way. It is designed to drop in to the list. Besides why do you want to drop it in the title. Title is like the header to the list\n. If you use the latest release it should solve your issue. As the  useaccounts: core package is updated to the latest version. \n. That is interesting. I was referring to  this github issue in the useraccounts https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core/issues/599 which has the same issue as yours and they updated the useraccounts package to remove this bug.\n.

    "neandrake": "Should LDAP authentication be included within the scope of this issue?\n. I just got this up and running on a local machine and here's what I did.\nNote I don't know much about meteor, and haven't used much in the way of heavy-npm-library-dependent projects. I'm also not properly schooled on server administration, so check with your IT, etc.\nSystem\nCentOS 7 (Minimal Install) - The main project I install/run at /var/www/libreboard/.\n1. Create libreboard user\n$ sudo useradd -r -m -d /var/www/libreboard libreboard\n1. Delete the files created in /var/www/libreboard from useradd (there might be a param to avoid this step). The git clone won't work unless libreboard is empty.\n2. Clone the repo - I used the HTTPS url as I did not want to bother setting up ssh accounts to access github.\n[neandrake@machine /var/www] $ sudo -u libreboard git clone https://github.com/libreboard/libreboard.git\n1. Note - The minimal install of CentOS 7 has SELinux running under 'Enforcing' mode which means only certain ports allowed to be bound by a process. I previously set the mode for SELinux to 'Permissive' while testing out other services that needed other random ports opened. This involved modifying selinux config file and running a command to actively change the mode. I would expect the service to not properly start with an error about not being able to bind to address/port if this wasn't the case.\nDependencies\n\nInstall Mongo - follow instructions on mongo's website - add repo info for mongo then something like:\n\n$ sudo yum install -y mongo-org\nNo additional mongo configuration was necessary at this moment.\n2. Install node + npm. I had done this previously on the machine, but should have been something simple like:\n$ sudo yum install -y nodejs\n1. Install Meteor - follow instructions from the website\n$ sudo curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh\n1. Install Forever\n$ sudo npm install forever -g\nBuild Libreboard\n\nRun Meteor - I first tried running the build script in the repo but that did not work (likely something I'm missing with this setup) as it complains something like '/var/www/libreboard/.meteor' exists, but '/var/www/libreboard/.meteor/meteor' is not executable.\n   Instead I run meteor as root, then chown the new directory stuff back to libreboard. I assume when upgrading this step will be required again until this problem is resolved.\n\n$ cd /var/www/libreboard\n$ sudo meteor build .build --directory\n$ sudo chown -R libreboard:libreboard /var/www/libreboard\n1. Run build script\n[neandrake@machine /var/www/libreboard] $ sudo -u libreboard ./build\n1. Open firewall for the port used by the build script\n$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5000/tcp --permanent\n$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload\nCompleted!\nAt this point the service is running and I could use it by navigating to the server on port 5000.\n. OK So Meteor shouldn't be required to run the service, but it's used to build. I agree with @mquandalle that we could update the repository so that meteor is run, and then a commit is made with the resulting content. We should create a configuration file used by the build script which is not part of the repository (maybe have a sample/default config file which is, and can be used as reference). That way modifications to the build script are system-agnostic and can be tracked in commits, but when configured for specific systems the config file can be modified and not interfere with the git repo.\nI will create a Wiki with the information from my previous post. I think I might fork and play around with the build script, resulting in a pull request - before creating the wiki.\n. I'm not sure then - looks like the fibers package may not exist. You could try running npm install somewhere within that directory to try and get npm dependencies to install.\n. That's installed globally though, right? The output you listed earlier shows that it can't find some fibers file inside:\nError: Cannot find module '/xxx/libreboard/.build/bundle/programs/server/node_modules/fibers/build.js'\nThe project is probably sandboxed - defines its own dependencies rather than relying on globally installed dependencies.\n. @Aekschen I think that's just missing functionality from libreboard. The forever error is just stating that it couldn't find a process that looks like the one that it's starting - since it's attempting to restart a service. If it's the first time running then it will show, but continuous runs will not show that error unless the service ends unexpectedly.\n. It would probably be a good idea to link to the Install wiki from the readme that shows on the project landing page.\n. I have a few comments regarding small improvements to the current interface. With the UI redesign plans in this Issue, I wasn't sure whether improvements to the current design would be continuing. I can make separate issues for these, but I figure I would just mention here first.\n1. Popup menus should close when their button is clicked again. Examples of this include the Profile/Name menu in top right, the New Board '+' button in top right, a card's options button in the card's top right, etc. Currently you have to click somewhere else on the page to close these popups.\n2. On the flip-side, the click-to-edit paradigm currently requires clicking on an 'X' to cancel/hide the editable text field. This form should cancel (or save?) when clicking elsewhere on the page and lose focus. Example of this include clicking a list's title to rename. I don't think this should apply to forms with multi-line textareas as this generally indicates a large amount of data can go in, and this should not be lost when changing focus - example of this would be adding a new card form.\n. For Note 1, I think the small clickable space next to the Save button is supposed to be an X similar to other forms, but there is no X icon. It behaves like other X buttons on other forms however.\n. Sorry, yes I was referring to server-side logs, specifically the log file specified in the build script:\nLOG=\"$APP/libreboard.log\"\nLooking in this log I found several exceptions, but could not determine when they happened or their severity. I'm not familiar with the meteor framework, so maybe something just needs configured in that case.\nSome specific events that I would like to see logged, along with errors:\n1. Service starting (include starting parameters, like port #).\n2. Service stopping\n. This is a feature request. Libreboard would need settings/configuration page to add LDAP authentication. Currently the authentication is against the application database. Having the ability to delegate authentication to LDAP allows for all users in an organization to have immediate access. Rather than requiring each user to register their own account.\n. I had tried browsing the code to see where authentication occurs, but hadn't found anything. I have no idea what Meteor does exactly but I'm assuming that by doing install/build there's some authentication dependency that gets loaded which takes care of it. I would be willing to assist with this but I don't have much of a dedicated effort to setting up a build/test environment, as well as learning Meteor and the wekan codebase.\nI took a quick peek at the accounts-ldap package @rysiekpl linked, and some things look a little concerning.\n1. The package claims to be a step above proof-of-concept, to my mind means changes are likely needed upstream in this package.\n2. The example of logging in is listed as \"Client Side\", and appears to allow specifying raw LDAP dn query. This is a little worrying as it might allow a client to construct probing queries. The LDAP query should only ever be constructed server-side, much like a SQL query.\n3. An item under \"Issues + Notes\" reads: \"... the user/password are sent to the server unencrypted. I still need to figure out a solution for this.\" - I'm pretty sure this is the reason why an install should be using HTTPS and not plain HTTP. This is how most logins work and why your browser should warn with having password fields on a plaintext connection.\nIf someone who is familiar with Meteor and how accounts are managed/authenticated I would be willing to assist and provide any insights from my experience with LDAP. Here are some other resources which might be useful:\n1. A different meteor account ldap package: https://github.com/UK-AS-HIVE/meteor-accounts-ldap\n2. A large js library for both client and server features: http://ldapjs.org/client.html\n3. This looks like a very simple library which only aims to provide authentication support: https://github.com/trentm/node-ldapauth\n. ",
    "andreioprisan": "I think Google Apps integration would be a better bet and you can use this in the future feature development (i.e. managed team access)\n. @ocdtrekkie of course not, they're different concepts. This isn't for data hosting linked to a Google account, this is only for login. Twitter login doesn't give you email address so you can't use it for email notifications. Facebook login does give you email address but in any semi-professional setting, you will not want to link your Facebook profile. Again, this is only for the Google Apps login and potential expansion to sign up other users within an organization to create user accounts, down the line. \nThis wouldn't take away from the current email signup that's not linked to any service, nor should it.\n. Creating an Amazon AMI would also be a good option here, helping companies justify a self-hosted option and drive adoption easily.\n. An Amazon AMI is a machine image (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSToolkitVS/latest/UserGuide/tkv-create-ami-from-instance.html) that you can create and publish on Amazon, so that others can use. For instance, there are AMIs for Wordpress installs. \nThen, anyone can launch that public AMI under their private account without worrying about having the right setup and versions of packages etc. from scratch.\nThe AMIs would be versioned for each major release.\n. #76 deals with remote installations on Heroku/Amazon.\nMeteor is the framework, it's not required to run but it is required to build it. All you need is nodejs and mnogodb for running.\n. This doesn't have to be a complete UI paradigm shift to get back on GitHub. There is only so much that you can change while still keeping the cleanliness and simple flow that is inspired by Trello flows.\nJust remove offending hot-linked assets and styling that is 100% original to Trello so that others can continue to contribute. \n@mquandalle @yasaricli I can take a stab at a UI cleanup to get this back here so that other people can continue to contribute. Short of forking this and taking it a different direction, how could I contribute?\n. @alvinsight implementing or left or right is not a legal issue in and of itself. The issue was with the 100% style copy, which we can't do. Having the same data feed there would be OK.\n. @fnky I love the view without the explicit right sidebar and being able to just toggle the Activity feed if needed.\n. This project is hosted on meteor.com. You can deploy on domain.meteor.com through the meteor command line tool, for free. The libreboard domain is simply CNAMEd to the libreboard.meteor.com site.\n. +1 to restrict flow and release planer.\nResource and workload planning is an entirely different feature set that requires user management functionality.\n. any update in the last few weeks? the newui URL still shows the initial version\n.

That should be more clearly disclosed, maybe.\n. @Slava meteor.com won't even load properly for me, so it's hard to check what they offer, etc\n. @ocdtrekkie so is libreboard.com in fact hosted on meteor.com?  If so, that should probably be documented\n. @Slava I just think that the reason for a cross-domain connection on every page load should be made clear.  If it's just because of the way the hosting provider works, then probably no additional metadata is leaking, so it should be fine, but that's not immediately obvious when seeing the connection.\n. @ocdtrekkie it's not about the hosting provider, but the cross-domain request.  Documenting why it is a reasonable cross-domain request.  Which it is.\n. @fnky Yes, but right now one cannot choose the username, it's just created when your account is created out of your full name.\n. The link on the homepage should probably go here instead of there, then.\n. It appears that var selectLabel = Blaze.getData(selectLabelDom); always returns colour of \"green\" and name of \"\", but name works because it is being selected out of the DOM directly.\n. Manually calling Boards.update(\"board-id\", { \"$set\": { \"labels.2.color\": \"orange\" }  }); worked, so it's just that the wrong data is being selected.\n.

Libreboard does not use any assets, name or code from trello (possible exception for Trellicons?). But are there other kind of infrigements? Does Trello need a patent for this project to become ilegal?\nThe main question I would like to add is if doing this is ethical or not.\nLibreboard contributors have all the merit for this software, but when we're talking about ideas/concepts, the boundaries are bit more blurry.\nSo two questions: Is it legal? Is it ethical?\n. Is the design really that important?\nWhat if the design is different, but the features are exactly the same?\n. ",

You're clearly misleading users by posting an MIT license on this repository.\n. I second @wpietri; I'd suggest removing any admittance of guilt just for legal reasons, but deleting the whole thing and writing an apology is the right thing to do.\nI'm surprised by how many people have no understanding of copyright issues and the notion of code  license. We grew accustomed to the notion that anything on the internet can be freely used. This is NOT true. Every single sentence has an author behind it and every single line of code (including most definitely html and css) has an author and copyright holder. You can ONLY use that code if you were given permission by the copyright holder (generally the employer; occasionally the developer if not employed or can prove that they were working on personal time, personal equipment).\nMy advice would be to completely abandon the project and let someone start from scratch. It will be very difficult for the current authors to prove they did not use any of the copyrighted materials in their future work. Normally, a for-profit company would have hard time going after a very similar open-source clone, but in this case there's plenty of evidence that would allow the court to give Trello's lawyers access to ALL your data(code, emails, etc) related to future development of this project.\nFurthermore, the possibility of legal action should raise a red flag for ANY company that would potentially use your code or your software. Many companies will not bother, but if you get included in a major project like libreoffice, you will put that project at risk. I suspect that something like libreoffice will reject your proposal after brief investigation in this incident.\nP.S.: It's a bit funny commenting on a repository that will disappear after github complies with the DMCA notice. I guess, we care.\nP.S.S.: I suspect, cloning a project is legally questionable.

It's important to note that we write all our code, and this code is completely different from the closed source Trello code that we never have access to. I believe there is no patent protecting the Trello concepts, but I really don't know much.\n\nCoders always tend to believe that code is the most important part of a software product. It's not. Actually, for most non \"high-tech\" software (which Trello definitely isn't), code and code quality is one of the less important components of the product.\nIf you copy a product 1:1 and change the entire inner workings, but leave the design and function unmodified, then you might not have stolen the implementation part, but you have stolen the other 80% of the work put into the product.\nNow, the line between \"similar\" (= legal) and \"equal\" (= stolen) is not an easy one to define. But in this case it is absolutely obvious that the way the UI was copied from Trello is not inspiration but copying, which is not legal anywhere in Europe or the US.\nI don' t even get how this can't be clear to someone living in France or Turkey. The laws in these countries are absolutely unambiguous there.\n. > just for bunch of CSS files\nYou don't get it. The CSS files are the mere implementation of months and years of research, trial and error, creative work, \u2026 This \"bunch of CSS files\" has cost Trello ten thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nHow about you start a business and put five or maybe ten years of your life into building the product, and then I come by, take the CSS files that have cost you YEARS to create, and use them for my own project?

Copyright doesn't care if its for commercial purposes or not. The whole point is that the creator (Trello in this case) has the right to choose how people can use their work. The Libreboard devs used it without permission - that's the issue here, nothing else.\n\nAll the current effort is for developing a new UI right now.\n\nAnd this is a good thing! Hopefully progress will be quick and Libreboard can come back soon, because other than the copyright issue, this looks like a fantastic project and a lot of great work has went into it.

    "rick": "I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice, but some thoughts:\n- Legally, it is difficult to pursue someone for mimicking a design. Design is generally not protected by copyright, and while there are design patents, they are fairly narrow and companies rarely file for them. The fact that Trello spent however much time and money coming up with a certain design doesn't generally give them legal rights to force someone to stop making an inspired or similar design.\n- However, the CSS files and trellicons and logo images from Trello's software are copyrighted. Trello are well within their legal rights to file a DMCA notice against anyone who copies those files and re-uses them without permission. That appears to be what has happened here.\n- In the case of \"mytrello\", Trello has a trademark interest in the name \"Trello\" and can use that interest to pursue the \"mytrello\" author legally. Trademarks, if not defended, can eventually end up unenforceable. So, Trello needs to actually protect the \"Trello\" mark by pursuing \"mytrello\" and negotiating some agreement that protects their trademark.\nSo: don't use someone's files or copy their code (C, Ruby, Fortran, HTML, CSS, etc.). Don't use their name. Feel free to be inspired by their design.\n:bow:\n. ",

We realize now that when we shifted our aim to producing a useful\nproduct, we should have thrown out that experiment and started fresh.

Hi everyone, just want to align the train of though here and please correct me if I'm wrong: \n\u2014 stu said that he might be able to develop his vision of trello ui further if anyone is interested. From discussion here it looks like there are 2 main directions to go:\n- implement new distinctive look\n- figure out new distinctive features / layout\n  While first seems to be a focused task the scope of which is relative easy to narrow down, the second seems to be a never ending improvement of ui/ux that not only touches how application looks but also how it functions (eg implementation might require backend changes, even db migrations). \nSince scope of first one is easier to pick on and easier to evaluate short term this is where I would propose to concentrate on. Eg in respect to his time, to ask Stu to further develop his vision of ~~trello~~ libreboard ui. Maybe concentrate on figuring out general ui guidelines - card, activity, settings etc. making it possible in the future for developers to extend ui using these guides in a way that product would evolve by that time. Again if you guys feel like it's the way to go.\n. Are there any metrics that could help us to stay on the path? Eg. What are the things that could be improved (in Existing design)? I think as users we could quantify usability issues (from our perspective) and leave it up for professionals to figure out the best way to solve those problems. There is no need to micromanage or introduce bias options like material design etc. \nI personally only figured 1 metric: \n- new layout should maintain a distinctive look to make product recognizable. Define that line where trello concept and libreboard concept floated apart. Criteria of success would be a layout that inherits all existing functionality (no judgement of what goes or stays at this stage) plus it's flexible enough to take in some realignment at the time new features land on to the project. \nI believe guys started this thread in the first place to find their own identity whilst having a default trello feature set bro start with. \nAny ideas ?\n.

    "stugreenham": "Hi Guys,\nThanks for including me in the list. My reason for doing the redesign in the first place was because I was unhappy with the existing Trello look and feel. It feels dated, something I contacted Trello about but got nowhere.\nWhilst I don't disagree with Crawford95's comment, I must add that this was done intentionally. I wanted to clean up the UI and remove anything that wasn't super important so that the focus was more on the lists and the cards. Simplify.\nA user can still get to his/hers other boards, or invite another user in, etc but some of these features sit behind a click, something I felt I was okay with. As a user of Trello myself, I find that 90% of the time, I am just dealing with the cards.\nCheers,\nStu\n. May I add - I am more then happy to help out with this project if you need any help from a visual/ux point of view. Just let me know!\nCheers,\nStu\n. @ocdtrekkie I don't disagree with your comments - but I must stress that this mockup isn't to be taken too literal. I did this one mockup on a Sunday afternoon so I could play with Sketch. Had this project been a more then me just 'playing with ideas', then I would have gone into more detail and ensured all angles were covered and other screens and flows were sketched and designed.\nI agree about the feed - but I must mention that this critical feed you speak of is also hidden by default on Trello. I hadn't ignored this or any of the other features and like I said above - this isn't a design that I was commissioned for. But I do think this is a good point.\nRe the spacing - this is something I considered and from my experience dealing with Trello boards involving 15+ people I personally prefer the slightly larger spacing because I find the content more readable. When you add user icons/labels/comments and more to every card it soon becomes a chore to follow with your eyes. I had considered a compact mode similar to Gmail.\nIf you compare the header on Trello to the header on mine you will notice maybe 5 more pixels in height. Nothing hugely worrying there.\nI'm happy to look into developing these concepts further if anyone is interested - This was purely a 'first crack' at it which tbh I am pretty happy with at a starting point.\n. @mquandalle Just caught up with the thread - I'm happy to discuss the potential of using my mockup design but I would want my input. There is a lot of different opinions on here (which is good btw) and I'd be worried that once everyone has there input we could end up with a car crash of 100 different styles and ideas.\nI think a lot of people are focusing too much on theming and colours etc. I've always thought of this feature on Trello along with their stickers etc to be an unnecessary distraction \u2013 If you are worrying about the colour of the board and not the content then you are doing something wrong.\nWhat did you have in mind going forward then? Is this purely going to be web based for now?\n. ",

This should move a bit faster.\n. Ok. This is now becoming chaotic. Everyone seems to have started implementing their own visual version of the app. Because what I've seen so far doesn't go in line with Stu's design however you put it.\nLet's first agree and get a confirmation from the owners which design should be implemented or who would (and is willing to) guide visual implementation. My opinion is (and I see majority thinks the same) that Stu's version should be implemented. Stu is also willing to participate (great!). A developer can only design an interface as good as they know from their development ability, but a designer (and possibly a UX designer) can go even further to make something more useful and easier to use.\nI suggest Stu's design be implemented and guided by himself, so he can tell implementers what's invalidly implemented and which parts should be included as well. And he's right when he says that colour is unimportant. That's always right in design. If it works in BW it will work even better in colour. So UX first and then design as per Stu's guidance.\nLet's first agree on this. Someone (or a group of few) should be managing this project and its outcome. Otherwise nothing will get done in the proper way culminating in failure.\n. @Shekar73 Not all members need to be displayed at the same time. There can only be a handful 7+-2 and a dropdown. A similar approach is done on Google Docs where one can collaborate with users that are on the same doc at the same time.\nGo check this Google Doc that usually has many many concurrent viewers. Cklick link and wait for the document to completely load and check the upper right corner user list.\nUsers are anonymized as per Google's implementation, but that's not the issue here.\n. @orangejuic regarding #2. It's not that anybody opposes usage of colours. I don't think that majority like Stu's design because of that but rather of the execution, how well vertical space is used by adjoining cards visually separating them by line only. This gives cards more breathing space and doesn't confine individual ones inside strictly defined borders. That's the great thing about his proposed redesign.\nThis way each \"list\" becomes a column of visually joined cards. Why people relate to that so well? Because it better mimics real world. Imagine a newspaper where each individual article would be put inside a visually defined container. Articles in newspapers run in columns and usually not being separated by any other marker than whitespace and their content emphasised parts (titles separate individual articles in the same column vertically, whitespace separates columns horizontally)\nSo that's the whole beauty of Stu's design. I wouldn't use black background either. Actually I'd try doing it even more like real world and keep background white and individual lists without any borders. But in this case majority of card data should be left aligned to relate stuff correctly (i.e. avatars belong to the card with data on the left, not to ones on the right)\nSomething along these lines:\n\n. @ocdtrekkie I'm not sure what you mean or what kind of a screen you're using, but the main idea to post the UI was to show that Stu's design isn't so much about colour as it is about individual elements design. I've maybe done it all to light. It displays fine on my monitor though.\nMy changes are just put directly on Stu's original design. It should of course be greatly improved upon as I was just removing or changing a few bits and pieces.\n. ",

I took the decision for a light background, that didn't feel too off the overall design and still preserving the functionality\n- Can be moved\n- Groups tasks/cards and visually shows its volume.\nAs for the buttons, I chose to put it in the right side, as this layout is used widely throughout every day applications\u2014both on the web and OS').\nThey could also fill the whole board/list, but that feels too bulky.\n. :+1: I agree with @litera \u2014 We need to organise tasks for anyone who would like to participate in putting this together as a team, not as individuals.\nIt's important that we don't waste our time discussing the look & feel of the app, but rather start discussing the functionality and the user experience.\n. Took some of the ideas into consideration and made a few changes + an extra mockup without sidebar as @mquandalle suggested.\n\n\n\n@Squ34k3rZ I don't quite see the idea in implementing a chat system in a Kanban board, since it can easily be integrated with a wide range of services (like Slack, HipChat, etc...)\nIt's important to make one thing and that thing well. Implementing chat, voice- and video is certainly something that takes time to implement, which isn't mandatory as there is lots of services out there.\nAs for the audience, we will never know, but Kanban is a widely used method for anywhere between small to large groups of people and it'll probably be picked up by any kind of company. Therefore it's important to discuss about features that are useful to Kanban.\n. Thanks for the response @mquandalle \nWhen I initially made the mockup, I thought of adding labels with explanations of the components. I like the approach that having a sidebar by demand on larger screens, and keeping everything tight but still available on smaller screens.\nThe Filter dropdown should actually be a Labels/Tags dropdown. I already had in mind, that you filter by members by clicking on the members avatars, since you'd be able to also filter by more than one member. However, only about 7 avatars will be visible, so that'll need a dropdown as well to list all members within a project and filter by them.\nFiltering by tags is just a matter of opening the tags dropdown and select the tags you'd like to filter by and searching would be a smart search with commands and keywords.\nWe'd also need to be able to filter by tasks assigned to you, and perhaps also unseen activities.\nI like the approach that when you're filtering, it'll show you the filter settings. This gives the user a notice that the data they see is filtered and they can change the filters or reset them.\n. I'd imagine that you have both a username, used to @mention people and the full name for personal identity.\n. ",

I guess the mobile clients should work with DDP in order to maintain the real-time features, but for integration with 3rd party services IMO REST would be the way to go.\n. @kadishmal Do you think that Apiary would be a better option than say swagger 2.0? From a swagger spec you can generate client/server boilerplates for many languages/frameworks... I think it'd be a better option. Check out the swagger editor, the examples and specially the export options.\nAs for DDP, it'd be nice to have it just in the mobile clients.

I see a lot of people are liking Stu's design, however I believe having color is very important to have an easy overview of either what the cards contain (color in function of content) or freedom to choose the color of a card upon its creation (personally I'd be more inclined to the former, which would prevent a lot of headaches I believe)\nWhat do you think?\n. @litera I wasn't saying stu's design is entirely bad, just that the lack of color is a flaw that has to be remarked upon. Now about that design you posted, I believe @ocdtrekkie to be right in that there are no cards anymore, only floating blocks of text, simply because the cards and the columns aren't clearly defined, like in Stu's design.\nFrom afar, I can't distinguish clearly the cards in your design, and that's a major flaw in my opinion because a card is so much more than only text. It's supposed to be designed to contain files, images, recordings, a video or even a link.\nThe design you posted doesn't seem to be adapted to all of that, because it's made to contain a bit of text and that's it, when Trello (the base idea of this project) is made to contain so much more.\n. @pwmvx1289 I think that's a little beside the point of the kanban board, especially if what we've started off with is the Trello design\n.

I rebased this commits on the current devel (so that they can be merged more easily), added on commit that adds two missing title attributes in the board header (I missed that earlier and noticed it while rebasing) and added all changes since v0.10.1 to the changelog (hopefully I did not missed something).\n. This now also fixes the view of the attachments inside the card details.\n. @irfanitw #298 is not closed. This is still an open bug report.\n. meteor build always works for me. What versions of node and meteor you are using?\n. Wekan is currently using meteor 1.3.2.4. You have to upgrade it first or use the old version of meteor. As stated here errors in the fibers module are common, but the it's simply where the error is being caught and reported.\n. Meteor currently requires node 0.10.x. Once meteor-1.4 is released it will support node-4.4.x.\n. The translations are managed in transifex: https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/dashboard/\nYou should update the translations there.\n. I cannot reproduce this.\n. Ah, the problem is, that the card is not movable to the end of the second list? It seems that it only starts to create drop targets, if you drag the card above the second lowest card of the second list (but after the drop targets appear it is possible keep dragging the card to the bottom).\n. You should change the ROOT_URL in the docker file.\n. It is currently only possible to archive a list. It will be hidden and you can restore the list from the archived elements view.\n. @franckFleet That sounds more like #656.\n. > Chinese translation wording change,\nTranslations are managed using transifex: https://www.transifex.com/wekan/wekan/ Can you please update the translations there?\n. No, new strings should be added to the en.i18n.json, only. Once this get merged the strings will be updated in transifex and can be translated there.\n. Currently there is no such feature.\n. Do you have a trailing / in your ROOT_URL environment variable?\n. Can you please try something like Meteor.absoluteUrl('b') in the javascript console of your browser? Does this include the doubled /, too? \n. I do not know why this happens, but I will look into it. (But maybe not before Monday.)\n. Can somebody please evaluate the following lines (in the javascript console of your browser):\njs\nFlowRouter.url('card', {boardId: 'board', slug: 'board-slug', cardId:'card'})\nFlowRouter.path('card', {boardId: 'board', slug: 'board-slug', cardId:'card'})\nFlowRouter._basePath\n__meteor_runtime_config__.ROOT_URL\n__meteor_runtime_config__.ROOT_URL_PATH_PREFIX\nThe issue might by in the kadirahq/flow-router package. I think the issue might be, that _basePath in https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/blob/master/lib/router.js#L6 does not contain a trailing slash.\n. Yes, like expected. Flow router removes the PATH_PREFIX and supplies the remaining URL to Meteor.absolutUrl with the trailing / and that results in the double slash.\nAs quick fix, can you try to add the following in config/router.js (f.e. just at the top of the file):\njs\nif (FlowRouter._basePath) {\n    FlowRouter._basePath = FlowRouter._basePath + '/';\n}\n. Note: The meteor version currently used by wekan requires node-0.10.x (see also #634)\n. I do not have any experience with docker, but:\n```\nFlowRouter._basePath\n\n\"/wekan\"\n```\n\nlooks like it does not work. It should evaluate to \"/wekan/\" if the code works. So either my code does not work or the code is not running. Running the production version of a meteor app should load the minified code, so you may not find a individual file representing /config/router.js.\n. @mquandalle should decide that. But  first it would be great if someone could confirm that it will actually fix this problem.\n. You can simply add a console.log(FlowRouter._basePath); inside the if and watch if you get a message in your javascript console.\n. This is the related issue in flow-router: https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/issues/684\nThis will most likely fix it: https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/pull/691 So let's wait until flow-router is fixed and than update the dependency in wekan to use it.\n. @piningforthefjords Just to be sure: You adjusted the ROOT_URL setting in the example?\n. This should be an issue not a pull request.\n. The issue is, that there is no search function. Pull Request means, that you have an own branch with the required changes to fix a problem and want to get it merged in the upstream (see Using pull requests), it is not something like a Feature Request. You have opened a Pull Request requesting to merge devel into meteor-1.3, but devel does not fix your problem.\n. Currently there is no such feature. See #55.\n. This is a limitation of meteor. See meteor/meteor#7218.\n. meteor 1.4 was released recently. After upgrading we will support node-4.4.7.\n. Wekan is already an organization account. @mquandalle could add people to the wekan organization, so that more people can help with the management of the project. @mquandalle could still set the long term development goals, but for example simple bug fixes and release management could be handled by someone else.\n. @mquandalle Is there somewhere something of your \"rewrite-everything solo plan\" available, so that maybe other people can help?\n. What's the issue?!\n. This could also fixed by using the jQuery map, because it will filter the null values.\nAnother location with the same problem is the emoji search in components/main/editor.js.\n. Oh this is a result of #616. It was a leftover from a local change.\n. Any explanation why you want to change the header logo?\n. This seems to be caused by bda1df5ada4cc086e4e05748f8019afbb24e0117 and is a result of #646.\nChrome does not seem to execute the transitionend event. Maybe we want something simple like this (to support all strange combinations):\n`` patch\ndiff --git a/client/components/cards/cardDetails.js b/client/components/cards/cardDetails.js\nindex b6f17c2..303f163 100644\n--- a/client/components/cards/cardDetails.js\n+++ b/client/components/cards/cardDetails.js\n@@ -65,6 +65,9 @@ BlazeComponent.extendComponent({\n       [${CSSEvents.transitionend} .js-card-details]() {\n         this.isLoaded.set(true);\n       },\n+      [${CSSEvents.animationend} .js-card-details`]() {\n+        this.isLoaded.set(true);\n+      },\n     };\n return [{\n\n``\n. ESlint >3.0 seems to require node-4. So this requires an update to meteor-1.4 first.\n. @wreels Did you setMAIL_URL? If you register a user, wekan will send you a mal. If you do not haveMAIL_URL` configured, there will be an \"Internal Server Error\".\nI think there is no reason to use docker, if you have a running standalone version. \n. If there is no relaying mail server, that is willing to deliver mail without authentication for your host, then you have to supply your user and password. But typical there is some mail server that delivers mail from a server network without authentication (or if you only need mail delivery to your internal users, you can simply submit the mails without authentication at the responsible mail server).\n. The value of strSMTPRelay should maybe work. But I do not know your setup.\n. You may need to change it at a few other locations. You should look into config/router.js and client/lib/popup.js. (And maybe client/components/main/header.jade for the header logo and the alt text.)\n. Duplicate of #624.\n. I can confirm that this is currently not handled. It could be added to the Boards.after.update hook when creating the activity for removing a member.\nThis is not only true for the whole board, but also for lists and cards inside this board.\n. The current version is not compatible with node 6.x. See #634.\n. The packages is called fibers but not node-fiber.\nWhat command did you run? Did you follow the documentation: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source?\n. Did you deply it from source or do you used the docker image? Maybe you need to execute:\nmeteor npm install --save xss\n. @raz99 It looks like you are using node-4.4. That's currently not supported. See #634.\n. This is an upstream problem: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/5372\n. There is currently no guide specifically targeting your desired setup. You can find some setups with docker in the wiki (f.e. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-Docker-in-production).\nYou can try to create a docker-compose for the letsencrypt stuff by yourself... Should be similar to the nextcloud stuff.\n. Wekan currently does not work with node 5 or 6. Meteor 1.3 requires node v0.10.40. Please see #634.\n. The certificate from https://ddp.wekan.io is expired on 2016-10-15 05:08 PM.. Fixed.\n. I think this shouldn't be here... And I think you should change your password now.\n. This shouldn't be here...\n. This should not be needed here, because jQuery map, will already filter out null values.\n. ",

What I found out (not sure wether it is true since im not familiar with meteor(d)):\nIt seems like the meteor build does some compression thingy, indicated by the source map file (account.js.map) so one has to rebuild the whole application under /app, i.e. having the modified file at /app/config/account.js, then  rebuild the application with bash /opt/meteord/on_build.sh (but because of meteor 1.4+ this fails due to the execution as root user so one has to modify /opt/meteord/lib/build_app.sh and  /opt/meteord/on_build.sh to remove the set -e in the first line and add the --unsafe-perm option to the meteor build command). \nNot only because this is very dirty but also because the build takes rather long and the base images are older than 4 months (!!) Id suggest to build the whole image yourself (maybe with meteor-launchpad?).. True.\nThanks!\n. Found a template in the community-catalog.

Yes sorry : https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1251\nI think it works (I tested a successful registration via web interface). I just forgot to modify one line by copying, this is why it worked for me ... :-D. It's weird, I have two installations (debian wheezy 64 bit) and it doesn't work on one.\nAnd actually I found no matter the MIME type is, only the size matter.

I assume you have already a first user who is the admin (it is the desired behaviour). I cannot reproduce the creation of a second user who will have admin rights :-(. The point 3 is really weird because there is nothing in the code which grant the new user as admin (isAdmin = true). And when I log in in the interface with the second user I'm not admin and when I retrieve the user's information via /api/users/:id there is no presence of isAdmin. So I really can't explain this. I can just suppose the environnement maybe is different and maybe the isAdmin field is present and it was set to true by default ... (but I'm pretty sure I'm wrong on this point) or maybe this line const userCount = Users.find().count(); is not working properly .... Anyone feels free to review in order to find this bug .... @nztqa You're right: the only purpose of fromAdmin is to avoid \"disableRegistration == true\", not to grant admin rights like isAdmin. And yes, it does not need to be save. Thanks for your patch, i will include it soon.. The use case is : when an employee leaves a company, the data belongs to the company and we want this data remain accessible but the former employee must no be able to connect.. Hi, I agree about this important feature. The problem seems no longer occur if you take ownership just before deleting the user. But that's a different problem. The problem is what to do if you want to delete the data belonging to the user instead of transferring them to the administrator? Maybe the admin should be able to define a data purge policy ? In case of deleting a user:\n\n\nTransfering to the admin\n\nOr delete the datas. At the moment we do not have a board delete function. What should be the default option for boards that the user has created?\nArchiving (not recommended because of the relation with the user)?\nDeletion (recommended but in addition it is also necessary to delete the link with the cards where the user is assigned) ?\nTransfer to the administrator?\n. @xet7 What happens to the imported boards?\n\nI am new to sandstorm/wekan and I imported a couple of boards today ( and deleted the originals from Trello ). How/Can I get these back?. I agree. It would be great to see recurring tasks that need to be completed on a schedule.. ",

",
    "xavierpriour": "I'll be happy to take a shot at it, if nobody's working on it yet.\n@mquandalle is it the right place to discuss UI and implementation? or should this happen on the roadmap board?\n. I've just had a deeper look, and here's my analysis:\nExported data\nTrello allows to export a full board (at board level: Show menu > More > Print and Export) or a single card (on a card: Share and more > Export JSON).\nImport mechanism\nImporting self-contained data (card text and title, board labels) should not be an issue, but we face interesting questions when dealing with \"shared\" data - data that might also be referenced by elements of the wekan instance, like members, or even labels when importing a single card.\nI see 3 possibilities:\n- create data: that's what Trello does for labels when you move a card to another board: its labels (if any) get created in the target board. In that case, we have to be cautious of collisions (if we already have a label with the same name/color, what should happen?).\n- map data: we find a corresponding, existing data. This can be sophisticated (like, try to map Trello card members to Wekan members based on mail address) or dumb (like, remove all members upon import).\n- merge: a combination of both: try to map, and if you fail, create on the fly. Of course, this is the most complex scenario\nYour thoughts?\nUI/UX\nAs a final target, I'd like to allow the user to pick and choose what to import where. For example, upon opening a \"board\" file, display data, then let user only select a few lists (or even cards).\nBut as a first goal, I'll aim to import whole files (card or board). This limits shared data problems\nSo that would give us two UI to discuss: importing a card, and importing a full board.\n- For the card, I plan on adding an item to the \"List Actions\" menu, just above \"Archive this list\", as this is a pretty infrequent action\n- For the board, I will add to \"My Boards\" view, but I'm hesitating: as an option in the \"Add a new board\" screen, as a button in the header by \"Archives\", or as a second line under \"Add a new board\"? What do you think?\n- Both items would then take you to a file select / text paste screen for the JSON, and perform their magic\nOther points\nHere's a brain dump for anything left:\n- Attachments: I put attachments apart, as they are actually exported as URLs to an S3 instance, so importing them means our server has to go and fetch potentially huge amounts of data. We need throttling, monitoring, retry, etc. So I want to keep this separate from the rest\n- Errors: I'll have minimal error handling for the moment.\n- Trello link: we have the Trello IDs in the export, so we could store them. I don't really see a use for the time being, and Wekan has no support for arbitrary data, so I'm dumping it.\nNext action\nMaxime, I'd like to proceed through multiple small PR's instead of a big bang.\nIf you're ok with it, I'll split it that way:\n- [x] import a card in a list through copy/pasting, no shared data (= remove members and labels), no attachments\n- [x] import labels and comments\n- [x] import a board, no shared data (= remove members, user that imports is set as board admin)\n- [x] import members\n- [x] import attachments\n- [ ] import a card through file upload\nThen we can discuss where to go from there: map members, UI to select parts to import, or decide it's \"good enough\" and move to other features. \n. Just finished step 1 as #358, @mquandalle can you review and tell me if some fixes are needed before I proceed further?\nA few more questions that came along the way:\n- how does Wekan handle errors? Would love if you could point me to a place where you validate a user input and display error (I need this in case of invalid JSON).\n- I'm wondering if I should really import the whole task history: it might be a lot of work, as the history might reference objects outside the import (other boards, inactive users, etc.), and I don't see a strong use case to support that - I propose to postpone it for the time being. Thoughts?\n- linked to it, for user mapping I agree with the implicit invite for members (because if they're listed as member, they're probably active), but I think for the rest (users mentioned in comments or history), it would be better to not invite (they may have left). I propose to link them to a \"technical\" user \"Old Trello user\" - do you have this kind of users in place?\n- the code is starting to grow, it does not feel right to leave it stuck in a client/components/lists/ (except for the UI part). Especially as the import function should be IMHO more of a server function than a client one. In a traditional architecture I would have put it in a Controller, but you currently only have models + client components. What do you think we should do? Add a TrelloImport model even if we don't have schema or persistence?\n- also, history is currently handled implicitly by the models, and I'd like to add an 'import' event. Doesn't feel right to do it straight from the component...\n. @fnkr I import comments and descriptions, that is all the info the user provides and Trello displays (just give me some time for the attachments).\nThe history I suggest we dump only include info like: \"user A created card on m/d/y\", \"card was moved from board B on m/d/y\", etc. Can you tell me what information this represents for you? Do your lists/boards represent task status (like \"done\") and you want to keep change dates?\nIf that's the case, I understand - what do you think we should do with missing pieces, like when mentioning a board we don't have? Or a user?\n. Hi guys, finished the board import - except attachments, members, and file upload.\nI'm wondering about those:\n- I believe uploading a json file is a \"nice to have\" compared to copy/pasting, so I'm leaning toward not doing it. Anybody strongly wants file upload?\n- I understand attachments are important for @fnkr but I have no Meteor experience with files download (from Trello to wekan server), so @mquandalle could you point me in the right direction on how to do that?\n- regarding members invite, as a user I'm a bit worried about a data import potentially sending mail invitations to people without my (and their) permission. So I'd like to implement just a mapping with existing users (with default to current user): that way if you (as a Wekan host) want to get proper members transfer, you first manually add them as users to your Wekan instance, then you do the board import. Not too hard, very explicit, and you have very fine control. All Wwithout the need for complicated import flow and screens. Thoughts?\nPS: @mquandalle could you please update the Wekan roadmap board to note the feature is being worked on - and maybe include a link to that Github page?\n. Hi, I just created a try.wekan.ion account: xavier.priour.\nFor the user mapping, I'm in favor of the mail mapping too. I'm just suggesting we don't do anything for non-existing accounts instead of doing: import screen > analysis > display list and ask for confirm > invite > manage \"invited but not accepted\" in the import process.\nI'll do a PR with that part soon (hopefully), will probably be a better place to continue the discussion :)\n. Ouch, I'm looking into member mapping now, and we don't have access to Trello members mail.\nThe only id we have to map is the username - I will match on it automatically, but I doubt success rate will be high. So we need a mapping screen after all :(\nThinking about attachments, the import will potentially trigger many downloads, possibly large ones. When you add possible failures, this screams for an upload manager - @mquandalle do you know if there is anything like that for collectionFS, like there is for meteor-uploads?\n. Just looking for something where the downloads would be queued, and you can view the list and their status, and cancel/retry them. To give users some feedback and control over what happens.\nFrom the description it seems power-queue was ok, too bad it's not maintained. It seems development on collectionFS is slow too: https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS/issues/840\n. I'm unclear - how would you map a CSV (that is, tabular data) to a Kanban\n(list of lists)?\nOn Tue, Nov 10, 2015 at 10:35 PM, Jade Q Wang notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI'd like to add a [image: :+1:] to importing CSV's as well, which many\napps have the option of exporting as, including across to spreadsheets,\nforms, and Gmail-plugin-CRMs. (Actually, I was trying to figure out how to\nimport a CSV to Wekan today, and realized that the feature didn't exist\nyet. [image: :joy_cat:] )\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/113#issuecomment-155574076.\n\n\nXavier Priour\n. Members import is in (with mapping), only attachments left!\n. That's it, attachment import is in #401\nIt's basic, but I believe if we want to do something more sophisticated, it would deserve its own issue.\nSo @mquandalle, I think you can close that issue :)\n. Added a page of doc on the wiki: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Migrating-from-Trello\nFeedback welcome\n. I like the idea - the popup always seemed too limited. I would add first a selector (dropdown?) to select which type of import, then I would use the space to display the panels for all additional data (like user mapping) in the same page as the import data itself. And I would add some more info about the mapping (like \"45 members in the import, 12 mapped\").\nAs an added bonus, this would remove the need to store import data in Session, which always felt hacky to me.\n. I would say so - I wonder if there's an actual use case for the feature anyway...\n. I'm voting for the removal. Can you do it as part of #430? I think it would make the most sense.\n. I love the idea too, it is definitely something I'm missing in Trello right now!\nTo me, the best UI would be something like HyperPlan: you have attributes to the cards, and can choose which one to use as vertical/horizontal axis. Incredibly powerful indeed.\n. :+1: for starting with the current Meteor package system right now - even something as limited as the import feature would benefit from even a v0.x plugin system.\nA first requirement to having plugin packages is to have core packages these plugins can depend on. Something like what the Telescope guys succesfully did, see: http://docs.telescopeapp.org/docs/custom-packages\nSo I believe that's where we should start. Only \"issue\" is that some minimum planning will be needed, as this will impact lots of code...\n@mquandalle what about the below?\n1. define the target packages on paper\n2. do a last release on the current architecture when you get back\n3. switch to packages\n4. happily hack away\n. Hi Maxime,\nThe goal is actually different: editorconfig wil just set your compatible IDE to the right style, without needing to change your settings, whereas eslint will tell you a posteriori.\nIt is voluntarily very limited and basic (spaces, tabs and end of file basically) so as not to duplicate with eslint. It is a cross-IDE setting rather than a set of rules or a linter.\nI find both complementary, and a nice touch when arriving on a new project that my IDE automatically complies with whatever tab/space style they have. Would you be open to trying it?\n. what IDE do you use btw?\n. You'll need the plugin then: https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime\nOr switch to Webstorm :)\n. To each his own then - \"les gouts et les couleurs...\" ;-)\n. Oops forgot to eslint - will fix!\n. merged with core wekan/devel + fixed an eslint issue in one of the new files - now passing :)\n. Perfect sense, and addresses some of my concerns mentioned in #113 \nWhat file should I put my method definition in, though?\n. Well, I'm going to start work on importing boards next - so mind if I create a models/trello.js right now and put the method in it?\n. Sure!\n. When generating activities for the card import itself, should it generate an 'importCard' only, or an 'importCard' + a 'createCard' (with same date)?\n. @mquandalle it should be good now\n. ok, did some squashing.\n. ok, something seems wrong, rebase brought your commits in my PR... how do I get them out?\n. Hey, I did not know about normalizr, thanks for pointing it out.\n(...looking into it...)\nTrello json is actually already normalized: lists, labels, members, cards are all listed at root level then only referenced by ID. I only have to build an id index, which is pretty straightforward, so I think normalizr would be overkill. But it's a good one for future imports that would not be presented as well...\n. Updates the comments to be clearer, handles \"team\" permission (mapping to Wekan \"private\"), and a big refactor to share most code with card import.\n. I'm on it!\nI'll just code the exporting of a whole board (no card or list), if you don't mind.\n. Hey @mquandalle, a JSON export to me is pretty much the first step of an API, so I'd like to implement this as a route to /api/b/:id that would return the proper json. The UI will just be a link to that URL.\nI would do the routing using https://atmospherejs.com/simple/json-routes, and code the json myself.\nIs that fine by you?\n. After some thougths, I think we need a proper Wekan JSON format for export & import. Using Trello format limits us to only data that Trello has and forces us to do some unnatural mappings.\nSo I'm going to code that - a clean export, and then an import for that. \n. In addition to Maxime's remark, we already have lots of small things that differ:\n- colors and permissions are not the same (both field name and acceptable values)\n- comments in Trello are stored as a type of activity, Wekan store them as specific objects\n- Wekan has the notion of an owner/creator for a board or list, Trello does not\n- the Trello export has no field to store the board slug (short name)\n- the names for all activities are different\n- etc.\nNone of the above is currently blocking, but it requires verbose code to transcode everything.\n. I don't think you can import a Trello board into Trello actually.\n. I believe normalized data is the way to go. Concise, consistent, easy to code and understand.\nI'm sceptical of JsonGraph, it seems to be pretty verbose and reminds me a little of the xml formalism. Why all the $ref, $type, etc?\n. Or maybe http://jsonapi.org/ ?\n. Damn, I've hit a wall regarding authentication/authorization:\n- with simple:json-routes, I have a beautiful url, and return json easily BUT I'm outside the usual Meteor context, so no access to userId. To protect access, I would have to use API token authentication, which means asking for user password again, and using additional packages to turn this into a valid token.\n- without simple:json-routes, I actually could not find any doc on how to have FlowRouter return json instead of a web page.\nAny idea?\n. None of the API-optimized/serve-side routers provide smooth authentication from a logged-in client - which is logical: they expect a first call to authenticate and get a token, then supplying that token to each API call.\nSo I've backtracked and implemented it as a UI-driven file download using filesaver, and everything works great. The export code itself is isolated, so the API can call it too once we have start implementing it.\n. Board export is called from the board view, which means client already has all the data. Why force a server generation?\n. Server-side done!\nFor the records, here's the blog post that explained it: https://blog.kayla.com.au/server-side-route-authentication-in-meteor/\n. Also, the user is not removed from board cards.\n. Good news, attachment import went very quickly, so it's included as well! \n. @mquandalle all fixed.\nSorry about the muddy git history but when I rebase, I get errors when I push to github \n. ping @mquandalle :wave: \n. Attachments are already implemented in Wekan at the card level.\n. done @mquandalle\n. Actually, Trello does not export the data :cry: \nLooking at the export of Meteor roadmap (https://trello.com/b/hjBDflxp.json), earliest activity/comment exported has timestamp 2014-11-23T15:29:04.999Z, whereas earliest comment in Trello is dated \"Dec 10, 2012 at 5:13 PM\".\nNothing wekan do :smile: => close and update doc.\n. In Trello, I use a Chrome extension that uses the label color as background color - and mixes them when you add multiple labels.\nWhat do you think about it?\n. Oops, sorry I was unclear.\nI meant building it into Meteor, but using the label color as background color, instead of adding another parameter.\nDon't know if we should make it the only behavior, or make it a parameter (and in that case, should it be board or wekan setting? And what should be the default?)\n. @mquandalle, a multi-step wizard definitely makes sense for such a process.\nImport was latency-compensated because why not? I could see this useful in a bad network/offline scenario, so not sure it's really worth removing it.\n. It's just that I believe the description should be: \"userA added userB to cardName\" in all cases.\nAnd current card description actually says that \"userA added card to userB\".\nYou're right, we could also shorten it to \"userA joined card\" when user adds himself.\n. Rewrote to be server-based, authentication through a login token passed as part of the request URL (the future REST API should pass it as a request header, it's cleaner).\nI also fixed the fact that my initial version did not export attachments.\n. Well, I was ready to make this import work with a minimal UI (think \"import from trello or wekan\") in the new board popup. That way, it's not blocked by #430, and as the UI is the same as for the Trello import, there is no wasted dev time.\n. Well, console is a pain and I'm a lazy boy :smile:, especially as we have to pass a lengthy json (Meteor roadmap long), and a member mapping, and the UI is 99% shared with the Trello component.\nMind if I put this in? I promise I'll take the UI out myself after #430 is in devel.\n. Thanks :smile: \nYou're right in the general case. Here, the thing is I need to pass the members mapping, which the UI builds for me. And as the code is easy, I suspect I won't repeat the same call multiple times, rather try a few different scenarios, and UI beats writing the damn mappings by hand.\nBut again, I might be discounting the time I'll spend debugging... as usual.\n. Sorry about that - let me have a look and I'll report back here!\n. @mfaure it seems to me you're talking about a different thing - the URL you mention is not an export URL (export URL mention /api/boards/, yours is /b/). Do you confirm you have a problem when exporting a board or do you have a different issue?\n. Hey @mquandalle, any idea why your CLAassistant does not recognise me as a github user?\nAlso, why is the CI failing - it seems to come from a yaml file?\n. Hi, same problem here with the official docker recommended in the doc (wekanteam/wekan:meteor-1.4).\nIt uses node v6.10.2, whereas meteor 1.4 supports node 4.8 only.\nI'll be happy to try and submit a PR, if you can just point me to the part of the repo where the docker builds are defined.. I confirm issue is solved, afaik you can close the issue, as well as https://github.com/wekan/wekan-mongodb/issues/2\nThanks again @xet7 . sorry!\n. I'm having trouble accessing the error field (this.error is undefined in my method) - where is it defined?\n. Yes, I'm still on it - I pushed a little too early :)\n. Done!\n. It means as an extra security, we could check that these data (color, permission level, background color) are part of a specific list - because if they are not, we won't be able to import them.\nBut I also think it's a \"nice to have\" thing.\n. I have no access to a trello orga - do you know where we can get an export sample so I can see what the value is? And is there a Wekan equivalent?\n. Nice. Does wekan have the same thing? Or should I map it to private?\n. Sorry, I don't know where this came from. Probably a meteor update gone too far. I'm removing it.\n. Thanks. I'm pretty disappointed MDG did not provide a cleaner solution when they built components.\n. Sorry, old habit. I'm replacing with 'object'.\n. done\n. Went for the later.\n. added a \"_format\" field, set to \"wekan-board-1.0.0\" to be as self-descriptive as possible\n. Done!\n. Gone with client-side saving anyway :smile: \n. By the way, any reason why the methods in this file (allowIsBoardMember and allowIsBoardAdmin) are not defined as Boards.helpers?\n. Done!\n. - using only the token, and as a parameter, is great. That way, we can use the same route for api access, just with code looking for token in parameter then in header. I like that :heart: \n- I'm not a fan of using an \"export\" method name, it seems non-RESTy, we just want a given board: api/boards/${boardId}?authToken=${loginToken}\n- the format parameter seems overkill for the time being. I suggest we add it later if needed (and keep current JSON as the default). But when we add it, we might use it to specify versioning as well (like ?format=wekan-board-1.0.0.json)\n. ok\n. The data you need:\n1. the list of members from the import file\n2. the list of users from Wekan (to auto-map and let user select manually)\n3. a mapping between the 2 (conceptually, a hash importedId => wekanUserId)\nThe current implementation used:\n1. the members field from the Trello import, which is not perfect if you want to re-use the mechanism for other imports\n2. the Users collection - which causes a bug: the auto-mapping looks into the currently loaded list of users, which is only the current user if you haven't opened a board yet\n3. for mapping, we added the Wekan User object to the import member directly. Pretty hacky...\n. ",

So I tried out the link that I gave them with a separate account, and was unable to create new cards. I went back and checked the \"See who has access\" list, and sure enough, the link given to FancyHands is listed as having \"edit\" permissions.\n\nSo even if the new person is signed in, they can't do anything. :-/\n.

Seems like it is heavily requested with some bounty added.. https://rocket.chat/docs/administrator-guides/authentication/ldap/\nIt'd be great if we could copy what RocketChat has done.

    "corecache": "I recently ported the RocketChat LDAP module for one of my own projects running meteor 1.6.0.1 - in fact it is quite a generic module but would still require minimal adaptations for Wekan, depending on what user structure Wekan uses. If by any chance the standard meteor user structure is beeing used, this should be easy to integrate.. As promised way to early in this thread, you can find my RocketChat port with minor adjustments here: https://github.com/corecache/wekan/tree/ldap\nState of that accounts-ldap port is:\n- Backend works with OpenLDAP, tested, should be ActiveDirectory compatible by defining the correct user objects, attributes aso via the LDAP settings.\n- There are currently no bindings to feed Wekan settings into that ldap module, thats rather a minor task.\n- There is currently no UI login button to use that service, calling Meteor.loginWithLDAP(user, pass) from the client will log the user in. Getting that LDAP Service to show up on the Wekan UI when LDAP is enabled needs to be done. Also a refresh is needed on the client when the backend logged the user in.\n. The fields are straight from RocketChat - I can elaborate with examples on them as well, since I have RocketChat in usage with LDAP.\nI am currently trying to bind the ldap authentication with the accounts-base loginhandler, but apparently there is a flaw in the accounts-base package which never calls further loginhandlers once accounts-password is loaded AND the accounts-base loginhandler only forwards the password as sha256 digest, which is not of use, since we need to login with the user credentials at the Slapd/AD in order verify the credentials. Unless anyone has a better suggestion, it seems we have to work around accounts-base here, and only forward to accounts-password once we failed to log in.. The LDAP module sitting in my wekan branch, is the one from RocketChat ported over to Wekan - all the options are the same. The only stuff missing is a) exposing the options somehow to the admin panel b) creating a client form which calls Meteor.LoginWithLDAP (which is already provided). There is this CAS module available already: \n- https://atmospherejs.com/atoy40/accounts-cas\n- https://github.com/atoy40/meteor-accounts-cas/\n. ",

Lots of organizations use Active Directory for users federation.\nActive Directory LDAPS (LDAP+SSL) would typically be a good target : https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoftrservertigerteam/2017/04/10/step-by-step-guide-to-setup-ldaps-on-windows-server/.

    "nebulade": "I have started working on this, no time estimate yet, but we have it working for our Cloudron package. Are there any requirements for this feature with regards to the servers it should work against? LDAP tends to be as configurable and thus complex as one likes, so it would be good to have an idea which LDAP servers should work from the start and thus I should start testing against as well.. Sorry for not reporting back, I gave it a try, attempting to follow what we have done for the Cloudron app, but that didn't go well, as there we replace the meteor accounts-password package with a drop-in replacement. Unfortunately I do not really know meteor much, to be able to extend the default packages with ldap auth at the moment.. So in 0319bcf7bb090328e67766234723f5986c00bba2 it got commented and apparently never reenabled. . It is the export menu item above the board archive item, when you click the sandwich bar icon on the top right. Thanks. I added it now. Please change it to your liking if you are not happy with it.. > Selenium tests, data migration and LDAP support are welcome as pull requests. You could also have platform-specific environment variables for Cloudron similarly as there is currently for Sandstorm, I don't see any reason to keep those in separate fork.\nSo far I think we have managed to never require Cloudron specific flags inside any app code and I hope we can continue to do that. Those variations just add maintenance burden to the upstream project often hard to test by everyone. From what I can tell if I get some spare time to prepare the ldap part all our local patches (like remove signup/password change/...) can easily go away. I would like that, but can't promise some time line when I get around to do that :-). I have pushed a pull request https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1454 to fix the list view card moving. The details view is still not showing with this though, but at least the issue from @johnleeming showed in the screenshot should be gone.. I am not sure how the relationship in the ui is between the swimlanes view and the lists view, but swimlanes appears to be based off the lists view, however the lists view as it currently is, does not appear to have any reference to show the card details panel. Maybe someone with more knowledge here could explain where the lists view would ever show the details panel, since it misses the +cardDetails(currentCard) logic from the swimlanes. . @andresmanelli ah nice, indeed I didn't look at all at your fork and was about to add similar changes for me, however given my poor code base knowledge as well as meteor knowledge, mine are just hacks ;-)\nSo I can confirm the three commits in your fork are fixing all those issues without side-effects I can make out. I think I will cherry-pick them for our Cloudron package to have a working app for our users. Thanks a lot, hope they get into mainline soon.. I will close this in favor of https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/f6fb05d3f49c656e9890351f5d7c0827bf2605c1.

I started working on it, but the piwik.js script that comes from the server where Matomo is located can't be loaded because of the content security policy.. Hi, I have built the application with meteor and the source code from github.com/wekan/wekan. Meteor says to me that the application is running at http://127.0.0.1 but when I go there, I have only the Nginx's welcome page. Must I make a special configuration for Nginx? It's the first time I use it.. If you do console.log(Settings.findOne()); the value is undefined. But settings are in database.. Ok, and what do you think about this code ?\n```\nTemplate.invitationCode.onRendered(function() {\n  Meteor.subscribe('setting', {\n    onReady : function(){\n      const setting = Settings.findOne();\n  if (!setting || !setting.disableRegistration) {\n    $('#invitationcode').hide();\n  }\n\n  return this.stop();\n}\n\n});\n});\n```. @biji No pr for the moment.\n@TNick Your way of doing things will not work. I tried before. The problem is that the request in the database is done before subscribe. It happens if you test http://localhost:3000/sign-up. On the other hand, if you click on the button to register on the page of connection, it will work.\nSo if you listen to the subscribe event onReady, it will work in any case.. Hello,\nYour environment variable LDAP_LOG_ENABLED is set to true?. Without containerization, by launching the code directly with meteor, I have access to the logs. I do not know enough docker for that, but it makes me think that the masking logs would probably be at this level. By the biggest chance the logs would not be sent on /dev/stdout and errors on /dev/stderr?. Ok, so, my pr on the repo wekan-ldap https://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap/pulls is not merged. So already even if you managed to connect the first time, you could not reconnect with this user. In addition, it also explains why you do not see any logs. Once the merge is done, I invite you to retry and paste here the logs obtained, because normally your problem will still not be solved. . Great!. Add this code to the file server/migrations.js \nMigrations.add('remove-customFields-references-broken', () => {\n  Cards.update(\n    {'customFields.$value': null},\n    {$pull: {customFields: {value: null}}},\n    noValidateMulti,\n  );\n});. Yes, I made a mistake. I'm fixing that tomorrow.. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1954. Hello,\n@Broxxx3 Did you try to use the LDAP authentication? If it was for registering one user and the environment variable DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD wasn't defined, it's normal. But if it was for logging in with an existing account, I don't know why because it works fine for me.\nFor the standard registering process, I could see that sometimes the address is /sign-in instead of /sign-up. So when you press the register button, it performs some actions that I defined in the /sign-in page.\n\nIn the file client/components/main/layouts.js :\nif (FlowRouter.getRouteName() !== 'atSignIn' || password === '') { return; } is false so it continue. After it calls user-authenticationMethod with the email variable gets by this action const email = $('#at-field-username_and_email').val(); but in the /sign-up page, this field doesn't exist so email is undefined. So it's for that you have this error : I20181117-16:05:33.271(2)? Exception from sub user-authenticationMethod id D74tDK98ppsytEEkq Error: Match error: Expected string, got null\nIt's possible to change this line if (FlowRouter.getRouteName() !== 'atSignIn' || password === '') by this one if (FlowRouter.getRouteName() !== 'atSignIn' || password === '' || email === '') to prevent the error occurs, but it doesn't realy solves the problem. The user should still reload his page to have a good address (/sign-up).\nNormally, this error I20181117-16:05:33.271(2)? Exception from sub user-authenticationMethod id D74tDK98ppsytEEkq Error: Match error: Expected string, got null. Can't happens in the logging in process. If someone has an idea?\n. ",

Current \"latest\" is 1.07\nAutomation seems possible too from https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release\n. Hello,\nThe main goal of a central Auth / DB is to have a single central management entry. So most information like group membership, user details (photo, name, email...) are to be stored there, and a flag should be set to limit the ability of the user to modify it locally (eg, cannot modify in wekan db).\n1) usually, the settings are fetched by precedence: 1) configuration file - 2) environment variable - 3) command line argument. Passwords should indeed not be visible (write only) but still available to change in the forms. For security, should passwords be supplied on cmdline, the displayed cmdline should either be cleared, either refuse to start. \n3) Not all fields exists in ldap, and their name might differs depending on the schema used. So it's the admin job to do the correct mapping between db fields and ldap attributes. \nGroup filtering might also be handled as a pure ldap query: this leaves all power to admin, while not having to implement it on wekan. eg, specific classMember, special location in the directory, dereference group of groups, etc...\n5) No need for that.\n6) There's no standard flags on ldap users grants. Almost all accesses are granted to groups, and thus members of these groups. \n7) To minimize load on the ldap server, access and grants should be only checked upon new session (like first login, or old session closed then reopened). That would let removed users to keep their access until they close the session, but that shouldn't be a real issue (or generate a timeout, or a ldap sync every 5 to 15 minutes).\nYou cannot save wekan data in ldap (it's not its job, nor a secure model) only use it to gather user's data at login. The real business data (cards, comments, stream...) is to be kept in mongodb, at the sole usage of wekan.\nBest regards,. ",
    "jolentes": "I saw that the 4 commands of @Saruspete are included in the Dockerfile already. \nWhat do I have to do to include wekan-ldap in the Docker build process?\n\nClone wekan into /wekan\nCreate packages/ folder in /wekan\nClone wekan-ldap to folder <workdir/wekan/packages/wekan-ldap\nSource app.env\nRun docker-compose build\n\nPS: Docker-compose build failed due to tar error when installing meteor. Had to add install of bsdtar and use it for meteor extraction. Git clone with git:// protocol also failed.\n. Hello,\nwhen multiple auth is enabled the methods should not be named with technical names (e.g. LDAP, OAuth2, ...) but with a logical service name the user can relate to (e.g. \"Corporate Directory\", \"RocketChat\", ...).\nNon-technical users need to be able to identify the auth method they would like to use.\nRequirement 3/4: What is the leading unique user id? How would you handle conflicts on username or email between e.g. LDAP and local accounts?\nWekan should never write to LDAP! I second that.\nInstead Wekan should update information from LDAP to local DB for fields defined. Many corporate LDAP implementation force updates to happen on their interface so they only have a single location data entry validation.\nRequirement 6: The right to access Wekan via LDAP auth should depend on a LDAP group membership. Once the membership is revoked the user should no longer be able to access Wekan. No need to disable accounts individually for LDAP users.\nBest regards. I have exctly the same issue! In Firefox you see this in the Developer-Tools -> Network Analysis.\nNo error message in docker-compose logs -f.\nedit:\nI double checked the LDAP connection parameters. I can connect with ldapsearch with those parameters from a different host. Docker container is running on the same host as LDAP (Univention Corporate Server 4.3). Found that also in my investigation. At first it was not, then I changed it and recreated the container. But the output did not change.. ",
    "GuiGuiSoft": "Hello,\nMy opinion,\nWhen multiple authentication methods are enabled, the dropdown should only list enabled on the wekan instance.\nRequirement 3 : Yes I think it is enough to be able to filter on one group. At least for a first implementation.\nRequirements 3 /4 : Wekan should get information in LDAP fields and store them to wekan DB. Environment variables should allow Wekan administrators to select which LDAP field match with Wekan fields. Wekan should never try to write in LDAP.\nRequirement 5 : Don't think it is important.\nRequirement 6/7 : LDAP informations needed for Wekan must be retrieved from LDAP and not editable if LDAP is the selected method for the user. Administrator must be able to change authentication method for one or multiple users.\nRegards.. Hello,\nI have the same issue. I suggest to \n\nadd a third option in member notification settings to mute all board in one go.\nmake the board notification settings work\n\nRegards.. Hello,\nHere is a first suggestion of expected behavior. The main purpose of this feature is to integrate Matomo in Wekan.\nAdmin panel\nA section \"Matomo\" is available (below Registration, Email, Accounts and Announcement). It contains the following parameters:\n - Enable Matomo tracking [Checkbox, if true: all settings below are enabled/displayed]\n - Tracking site URL [string, example: matomo.blabla.com]\n - Site ID [integer, example: 12]\n - Respect \"Do Not track\" [Checkbox, see DoNotTrack in Matomo API Reference]\n - Use user ID [Checkbox, see the UserID documentation page]\nDetailed actions recording\nIn a second phase it could be interesting to enable a detailed actions recording directly in Matomo to have similar stats as mentioned above by you, @xet7 . However I do not know enough the Wekan operation to suggest something here.\nRegards.. Hello,\nThe snap updated itself and I confirm that 1.18 still has this issue.\nRegards.. @biji : what is the Wekan Version displayed in your local docker version ?\nOn my installation (snap), it is 1.18 and I have the issue\n\n@TNick : so this issue could be a snap issue (if the snap does not contains the last wekan sources, like docker autobuild). I am quite lost with the versioning :thinking: . Nope, it was a mail server problem.... Thank you for your feedback. No hurry on this point, just looking for the best way to do it :). Hello,\nIt seems to work.. > we have a docker installation (which for me, save some ressources) with 75+ users and the machine hosting it has 8gb of RAM and 8 CPU. The RAM free is 1gb. We don't experience any interruption of service\nHow do you plan to scale to 100, 200 or 500 users ?\nYou tried Snap before Docker and Docker is less resource consuming ?\n\nDo more than 2 cores help? With our snap deploiment I can't see the benefit of more cores.\n\nHow many cores do you have ? For how many users ?\nIf I have to add 2 cores every 25 users, it will be complicated with 500 users \ud83d\ude32 . Hello,\nThank you for your answers. I understand that:\n - There is no major performance difference between Docker and Snap.\n - Docker already use Meteor 1.8 and Snap doesn't use it yet.\n - Meteor 1.8 is more efficient than the 1.6 version\n(I did'nt find any benchmark or article about 1.8 performance improvement. Do you have any source about this subject ??)\n - You plan to use Meteor 1.8 in Snap package before the end of February\nIs there any way to help ? ( @Akuket ?)\nRegards.. Hello,\nI have heard (read) that NodeJS wasn't very able to use multiple core. So even if I had more and more CPU, performance would not improve.\nIt seems interesting to run Docker containers in parallel to load-balance the user requests. I will try that and let you know the result.\nRegards.. Hello,\nI changed the deployment method from Snap to Docker and I scaled the number of application container to 4.\nThe results are good : improvement measured via Matomo is about 75% (average generation time decreased from ~10s to ~2.5s with the same number of users).\nFor those who are interested, here is the docker-compose.yml I use:\n```yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\nwekandb:\n    image: mongo:3.2.21\n    command: mongod --smallfiles --oplogSize 128\n    volumes:\n      - wekan-mongodb_wekan-db:/data/db\n      - wekan-mongodb_wekan-db-dump:/dump\nwekan:\n    image: quay.io/wekan/wekan:v2.17\n    ports:\n      - 80:8080\n    deploy:\n      replicas: 4\nenvironment:\n  - MONGO_URL=mongodb://wekandb:27017/wekan\n\n[ ... some variables related to my needs ... ]\n    depends_on:\n      - wekandb\nvolumes:\n  wekan-mongodb_wekan-db:\n    external: true\n  wekan-mongodb_wekan-db-dump:\n    external: true\n```\nI start and stop the Wekan stack like that:\nsh\nsudo docker swarm init #init the docker \"load balancer\" and the ability to replicate containers (it has to executed only one time)\nsudo docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml wekan #may take few seconds\nsudo docker stack rm wekan #stop all containers\nIt create 4 wekan-app container communicating with 1 wekan-db container. You don't have to use the docker-compose command anymore.\nIn my case, my conclusions:\n- NodeJS does not know how to use more than 1 CPU. You can add 30 (virtual) CPU to your VM, it won't change anything if you don't scale Node process (with docker or any Node scalling system like PM2).\nWith 4 node processes (each around 50% CPU), Wekan is finally usable for end users\n- Unlike Node, Mongodb is able to use multiples (virtual) CPU without crashing.\nWith a topcommand, mongodb can reach 300 or 400% CPU without slowing the application.\nWhat next?\n- I didn't try to scale the wekandb container (I assumed it could lead to problems like concurrent access problems to the database), but it could be the next bottleneck of this solution.\n- I have to find out why I don't see logs in syslog (will do an other issue for that :) ). Hello, unfortunately I must store my data on my own server (Security policy...) :). Hello @xet7 I can confirm that v2.37 is much better !!! \nIt is a great step forward because, even with 4 wekan containers replicas, the application was becoming unstable after 2 or 3 days.. ",

Either push the starred boards to the top or default to show starred boards only. Those usage figures sound similar or higher to ours so it's good (?) to hear that we're not the only ones having this problem. Today we were experiencing this issue every few hours. We didn't experience it on our old LibreBoard instance (don't know the version but I know it was on CentOS v6).\nOut of interest are you running all 6 node instances on different machines and have you experienced any concurrency issues? I didn't realise Wekan could even handle running in a load balanced environment. We're on v0.26 currently so will try the 0.27 version and will try the cleanup script as well.\nI'm not sure how I'm going to be able to debug it more though because this isn't something that is easily reproducbible. We have over 1000 unique users of the tool and this error seems to happen randomly within that user base.\nLooking around at similar issues with other users of MeteorJS it seems to be an issue with recursion; perhaps part of the code which removes documents (I don't know if this is attachments or JS documents). I thought that I had created some stability by upgrading and cleaning the DB but then this morning I had this error.\nJul 03 09:27:05 Wekan[28778]: Internal exception while processing message { msg: 'sub',\nJul 03 09:27:05 Wekan[28778]: id: 'r6JkooY5kTBEKRWeB',\nJul 03 09:27:05 Wekan[28778]: name: 'meteor_autoupdate_clientVersions',\nJul 03 09:27:05 Wekan[28778]: params: [] } Maximum call stack size exceeded RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\nEverything seems to be linked to exceeding the call stack size. I can increase it but I feel like that's just a workaround to a more inherent problem. Are there some recommendations for higher call stack settings or some other fixes?. Is this an indicator that Wekan (and/or Meteor) does not scale to 1000+ userbases?. Another failure today:\nJul 05 13:37:50 Wekan[27055]: Internal exception while processing message { msg: 'connect',\nJul 05 13:37:50 Wekan[27055]: session: 'a9giZbmfumPZoEcG7',\nJul 05 13:37:50 Wekan[27055]: version: '1',\nJul 05 13:37:50 Wekan[27055]: support: [ '1', 'pre2', 'pre1' ] } Maximum call stack size exceeded RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\nJul 05 13:41:11 Wekan[27055]: packages/meteor.js:786\nJul 05 13:41:11 Wekan[27055]: }).run();\n. Is there something I can do to help debug this issue? Any particular way of launching Wekan to provide a more in depth log of errors?. After taking a deeper look at the system log I can see that the previously reported errors do not appear to be the cause of the crashing. In fact it seems pretty impossible to see what is causing it because of the lack of verbosity in the failure message. When I see that Systemd has observed the Wekan process failing I get one of the following errors:\nJul 21 11:30:07 Wekan[5229]: packages/meteor.js:786\nJul 21 11:30:07 Wekan[5229]: }).run();\nJul 21 11:30:07 Wekan[5229]: ^\nJul 21 11:30:07 Wekan[5229]: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\nJul 20 17:03:57 Wekan[9145]: packages/meteor.js:786\nJul 20 17:03:57 Wekan[9145]: }).run();\nJul 19 17:12:05 Wekan[4494]: packages/meteor.js:786\nThis points to the \"_scheduleRun\" function in Meteor. There's very little online about this error except for the following GitHub issue which was not resolved. I wasn't able to fix the issues we were having but I have implemented a workaround through load balancing our Wekan instances. We now have 3x Wekan instances on separate virtual machines and an Nginx instance doing hash load balancing. We had no issues for ~7 days and then all 3 started to fail with high memory/CPU usage. For the time being I'm restarting each Wekan instance nightly to keep them going during operating hours. This sounds very much like one of the issues we've been having in #1096 . My userId was already admin:\n{\n            \"userId\" : \"SyRC7NFgmbpyrG9dT\",\n            \"isAdmin\" : true,\n            \"isActive\" : true,\n            \"isCommentOnly\" : false\n}\nAnd I was already set as Wekan Admin. You can see from my previous message that the account is not set as comment only. Nor are the other accounts with access to the board.\nWe have over 5000 boards in our Wekan installation and this error hasn't come up before. My guess is that there's something unexpected in the data which is causing the error. Have you seen the error from the original post before?. Ok one of our users has found the source of the bug. He found that when we have an outgoing Webhook set in the board we're unable to assign users to cards. When we remove the Webhook we're able to assign users again like normal. Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.\nI've done some testing and found it doesn't seem to affect all boards. So for example I've performed the following scenarios:\n\nAdded an invalid webhook (invalid URL) to a board that is 5 months old and tried to add myself as a member of a card = Fail\nAdded a valid webhook to a board that is 5 months old and tried to add myself as a member of a card = Pass\nAdded myself as a member of a card on a board that is 9 months old and already had a valid webhook = Pass\nAdded myself as a member of a card on a board that is 9 months old and changed the webhook so that it is invalid = Pass\nCreated a new board with no webhooks and added myself as a member of a card = Pass\nAdded an invalid webhook to the new board and added myself as a member of a card = Fail\nAdded a valid webhook to the new board and added myself as a member of a card = Pass\n\nSo the indication is that there appears to be something different about boards created between 9 and 5 months ago up to now that causes this bug when an invalid webhook is registered. Of course people shouldn't be using an invalid webhook but it also shouldn't be preventing users from adding other members to their cards. I'll take a look in our DB to try and spot some differences behind the scenes.. Actually scrap that. After checking in the database it turns out the board that was created 9 months ago had a webhook that was disabled so that's why when changing that webhook to an invalid one and adding a board member it still worked.\nSo my money would be on it being related to having an invalid webhook configured for the board. I would argue that this isn't complete because there's a bug that you can't change card members if the Webhook doesn't work. For me the expected behavior is that you should be able to change the card members and be notified that the Webhook was unsuccessful. This looks like a duplicate of the issue I was describing in #1402. > What I mean is that quite often, the nodejs process crash/die. And the only thing I saw in the logs was the line about bcrypt. Is there a way to have more verbosity, or any log ?\n@Madko How many users (registered and active) and boards do you have?\nWe have an extremely similar sounding issue on our end. We're running Wekan on Docker swarm with 4 instances and it's regularly slow performing with the instances restarting every few hours at a minimum. 3x MongoDB replicaset behind it.. > @GavinLilly\n\nWhat version of Wekan you are running? I could make new Docker version of Wekan, that uses newer version Meteor 1.8.x, I think it is a little faster.\n\nWe're running v1.58 but we've been seeing this issue for a long time on our previous instance running 6 nodes on v0.78. I'm not sure if it's due to the number of people using our service or something about our configuration.\nI took a look at Meteor 1.8. It looks like it could be beneficial to upgrade. Would you create a specific docker tag for 1.8 or would you just merge it into the next version?. > I believe you have to adjust the Dockerfile for the meteor-1.8 tag because it still builds with meteor 1.6.0.1 as far as I can see\n\nhttps://quay.io/repository/wekan/wekan/manifest/sha256:2aa23856ee5a24c49cd9e95efa661b291a2a9b14056ac8c9e2192dec6a940bd8\n\nI haven't tested the Meteor-1.8 branch yet but I agree with your statement in that I don't see how it's building with 1.8 as there's nothing (that I can see) in the Dockerfile which is pulling that version. After living with the issue for a few weeks I think it's actually not caused by Wekan or Meteor as some reset emails did get sent. To me it actually looks like a knock-on effect of our Node processes reaching high CPU usage, essentially meaning that the SMTP send process times out as the Node process is busy working on other tasks.\nThis would explain why some board notification emails have been sending correctly because those emails were sent during out-of-office hours (less usage and load on the servers).\nSo like many of the other issues we've had with Wekan in the past I think this comes down to our (somewhat) unique situation of having a lot of users/boards and in-turn high load. As a reminder we're running 6x instances of Wekan across 3x t3.large AWS instances.. No we're on v2.16 now. We've moved to docker now so updating has become much easier and we're doing so normally every few weeks. Honestly I have no idea what SMTP we're using or if it has limits. I can try and find out. All I know is we have an Exchange environment.\nHmmm yea a job scheduler would be quite nice I think. It would certainly take some of the CPU load off when you need it. No it's a SMTP server/relay provided on our corporate network. Unfortunately I don't know the architecture.\nJust to be clear, emails are working from Wekan, but only during low-usage times (evenings, weekends etc.). The newest build seems to be better for us. The processes still restart once or twice per days but the user interface is very usable. We're still planning on using Kadira to analyse our usage but haven't got round to it yet.. Ok that explains a lot.\nI'll create the integration for Kadira in a PR but I have no way to test it at the moment as we don't have a suitable test environment in our organisation at the moment. I've managed to add Kadira to the Wekan build but then when trying to run I get an error TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined.\nI'm still trying to debug it at the moment (which is difficult in itself when using Docker) but hopefully will have something new soon. It looks like it could be an issue in the Kadira code that isn't being fixed because Kadira isn't being maintained any longer https://github.com/meteorhacks/kadira/issues/259. I'll post up a how-to when I get home as I did it on my personal server. I noticed that the mdg:meteor-apm-agent package is actually a supported fork of Kadira by the Meteor people so I'm going to try that instead. It looks like it has a fix for the issue I experienced. Yea I'm building a new version now using meteor-apm-agent. Will report back soon. Ok I had a few issues building but they seem to be corrected now. It was having trouble running when the wekan-ldap package was enabled (I guess some compatibility issue). For now I've removed it so I can test if meteor-apm works and I can confirm it does. I can see all Kadira metric in a dashboard.\nSo to recap I have meteor-apm-agent as a package on Wekan and a Kadira stack running in Docker. To get Kadira running I ran the following in docker-compose:\n```\nkadira-engine:\n    ## This is the endpoint where Meteor app sends performance data\n    image: vladgolubev/kadira-engine\n    ports:\n      - \"11011:11011\"\n    environment:\n      - PORT=11011\n      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://wekandb:27017/kadira?replicaSet=kadira\n      - MONGO_SHARD_URL_one=mongodb://wekandb:27017/kadira?replicaSet=kadira\n    networks:\n      - wekan-tier\n    restart: always\nkadira-rma:\n    ## This computes statistics databases every minute.\n    image: vladgolubev/kadira-rma\n    environment:\n      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://wekandb:27017/kadira\n    networks:\n      - wekan-tier\n    restart: always\nkadira-ui:\n    ## Meteor app that presents the Kadira user interface.\n    image: vladgolubev/kadira-ui\n    ports:\n      #- \"80:4000\"\n      - \"4000:4000\"\n    environment:\n      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://wekandb:27017/kadira\n      - MONGO_SHARD_URL_one=mongodb://wekandb:27017/kadira\n    networks:\n      - wekan-tier\n    restart: always\n```\nEssentially I followed the outline at https://github.com/edemaine/kadira-compose but instead of running the full Kadira stack I picked and chose the engine, rma and ui and put it into the same docker-compose as my test Wekan instance.\nI've created a branch in my forked repo https://github.com/GavinLilly/wekan/tree/kadira-integration. If I can figure out the conflict with Wekan-LDAP then I'll create a pull request. I'm not having much luck debugging this error. I see where it's happening but I don't see why the code is being called when Kadira is part of the build. Posting here in case anyone has any idea\nW20190212-21:41:12.564(0)?

There was a conflict in the getValue prototype naming between Kadira and wekan-ldap (they both have that prototype). I'm not sure how the conflict crossed between packages but as a fix I've renamed the prototype in wekan-ldap and it seems to work.\nI'll create a separate issue in the wekan-ldap repo and pull requests in both for the fix and Kadira integration.

From what I could understand, there seems to be a problem with the function draggableMembersLabelsWidgets() in the file client/components/sidebar/sidebar.js.. @pradeepgokul why did you go into the flexiple fork of the project and pull code? That code was for some features that aren't really applicable here. :sweat: . @xet7 I don't think this really has any customFields code from the looks of it... But I could try and cherry pick the new commits and see what kind of changes have been introduced, if that helps.. @pradeepgokul just create a new branch and cherry pick only your commits to it. Then that'll be only your new changes.\nAlso please try and keep your commit messages meaningful and related to the changes made. Some commits, some more commits etc are difficult to parse.. ",

Let's say like this : he did all the effort, programming / testing and submitted the pr, do you really think he won't allow you to add the code to the wekan core? \n. Still not possible?\n.

Who agrees?\n. - Add users in Admin panel \n- modify user in Admin panel\n- remove user in Admin panel \n- modify user group (like the Admin user group, so you can make more admins or other roles) \n. Why does the maintainer not add another 2nd maintainer for this kind of emergencies? \n. Almost there... If you are using Docker, try to first find the MongoDB container ID (using docker ps), the with name \"wekan_wekandb_x\" and remember the container ID. Then:\ndocker exec -i -t <container_id> /bin/bash\nWhat vrninfo already said connect to the Wekan DB, via:\nmongo wekan\nList the users:\ndb.users.find().toArray()\nFinally, delete the user record! Hopefully this won't brake anything else :P\ndb.users.remove( {\"username\": \"admin\"})\nGood luck!\n. Ahha just try it :p\n. That is where I was afraid for. Meaning you first need to remove all the cards/boards (and.. maybe more?) that belongs to this user, before removing the user. \nFinal solution: Please, someone should implement this feature in the code behind a button. \n.

Yes I tend to agree with you, about the mobile version is not well designed.. :+1: . The other error I'm seeing is TypeError: $cardContainer is undefined.\nWhich is in fact very related to the previous error. On line 4853 of app.js: var cardContainerScroll = $cardContainer.scrollLeft();\nI think because of the same line kind of javascript code (this.parentComponent().parentComponent();) this fails as well..\nCode fragment:\njs\n    var bodyBoardComponent = this.parentComponent().parentComponent();                                                 // 46\n    var $cardView = this.$(this.firstNode());                                                                          // 48\n    var $cardContainer = bodyBoardComponent.$('.js-swimlanes');                                                        // 49\n    var cardContainerScroll = $cardContainer.scrollLeft();\n. Conclusion (after chatting with xet7): Remove the whole 'mobile version' regarding the swimlanes (basically restore this functionality). And introduce the swimlanes as is, on the mobile view as well (just like the desktop version).\nMy proposal: Create a separate menu item at the top for the 'side-bar' on the mobile view. So you can use the full width/space on the mobile viewport for the swimlanes. And use this menu item to open this 'side-bar' which will not longer be a side bar on the mobile screen --> I think this makes sense.\nThe menu/logo at the top is just fine on the mobile version. Also the extra footer with the swimlanes is not bad at all (as long as this keeps on working).. ",
    "lkisme": "see PR #618 \n. @irfanitw I tried to use the PR, yet there are some features my team finds them not so reasonable, such as only the creator of a specific \"check list item\" can check it as finished, I'm actually planning make a new implementation on that if there isn't someone else is doing that \n. I think it would take 1 or 2 weeks to implement that, given the design in #576 can be referred to\n. check this out #630 \n. @urbanhop \nYou seem to wanna build the project, did you do that properly?

I made a PR on this, check out #618 \n. Sure, but there are some new strings that I wanna add into the i18n file, should that be handled there too?\n. @danger89 I don't think \"add user\" or \"modify user\" is necessary, because 1. the user can register to system or be invited to the system, 2. the user's info should only be modified by the user himself\n. @jLouzado @HLFH there are a lot of merge conflicts here since a lot of PRs been merged lately, will open a new PR for review.. \n\n. @mquandalle any schedule for reviewing and finalising the diff to be merged? so we can proceed on working the the feature further.\n.

I\u2019ve left some inline comments on specifics code issues that could easily be fixed and that would polish the feature behavior and its integration in the Wekan code base.\nAs a broader open question I wonder if we really need/want to introduce a checklistItem entity in the model, as its schema looks very similar to the card schema with small semantics changes (a card is \u201carchived\u201d whereas a checklistItem is \u201cfinished\u201d). What if instead in order to keep the number of concepts low, we define that a checklistItem is actually a card whose parent happen to be another card; we would just have to change the listId property of the card model to an abstracted parentId. What do you think of this idea?\n\nYes, you are absolutely right about the idea of keeping number of concepts low, but this will introduce several other problems, 1st there will be hierarchy like a card(checklist item) belongs to a checklist that belongs to a card, 2nd a card usually is seen as a user story while a checklist item should be seen as a sub task(relatively smaller), 3rd to designe a abstract parent would introduce more complexities, how do you think about these?\n\n\nclient/components/cards/checklist.jade, line 1 [r2] (raw file):\n\nPreviously, mquandalle (Maxime Quandalle) wrote\u2026\n\nI would rename these three files checklists.{jade,style.js} to be consistent with the rest of the code base.\n\nDone.\n\n\nclient/components/cards/checklist.js, line 4 [r2] (raw file):\n\nPreviously, mquandalle (Maxime Quandalle) wrote\u2026\n\nWe try to avoid jQuery where it\u2019s not necessary. In this case you can use this.find instead of $(event.currentTarget).find. Also please give a js prefixed CSS class to the textearea field, like .js-checklist or something. Also you don\u2019t need jQuery either to .trim() the string as it is now a standard ES6 method.\n\nDo you mean add those classes into template file, or use the class to find the element in JS? cause there are already classes for each of them. like \"textarea.js-add-checklist-item\"\n\n\nclient/components/cards/checklist.js, line 10 [r2] (raw file):\n\nPreviously, mquandalle (Maxime Quandalle) wrote\u2026\n\nAfter the checklist is created, you should open the addChecklistItem form, so that the user could continue to type its item without leaving the keyboard.\n\nYes, that would be better, although I couldn't find a proper way to implement that, might need some help with the implementation.\n\n\nclient/components/cards/checklist.js, line 17 [r2] (raw file):\n\nPreviously, mquandalle (Maxime Quandalle) wrote\u2026\n\nSame thing here, after a checklist item is added, you should leave the form open (as we do to add a card) so that the user could write further items. You can also leave a JS comment saying that the logic is pretty similar to the \u201caddCard\u201d logic and could probably be abstracted away.\n\nsame as above, it would be great if there is a abstracted way to implement this logic.\n\n\nclient/components/cards/checklist.js, line 24 [r2] (raw file):\n\nPreviously, mquandalle (Maxime Quandalle) wrote\u2026\n\nPlease define a mutation in models/checklists.js and call it from here.

Interested with this.\n. @xet7 It seems a lot happened here in Wekan project lately, a lot of PR got merged, I'm glad to see the project is moving forward. For the PR #618 , the original idea is to introduce \"invitation only\" capability to the system, then I thought a admin panel would be nice for this kinda feature, but @mquandalle had a plan(plugin?) for these kind of features, I closed the PR #618 because there were a lot conflict there, I'm planing open a new PR for the feature for review.\n. @xet7 Done.. @xet7 The error should be gone.\nBTW, you need to name an admin among existing users if you already ran the project before by execute bellowing expression in the console of mongo:\n\ndb.users.update({username:'xxx-ur-user-name'},{$set:{isAdmin:true}}). @xet7 Just run db.settings.remove({}).. That's reasonable, but I think a checklist item should be a small enough subtask that can be described with one simple sentence, to remind you there's something that need to be done, from this perspective, you wouldn't need  the markdown rendering in the checklist entry to show fancy effect like bold text or nice link.\n. Just took a peek on the source code of email module, this should be easy to be done.. Already found the root cause, need a little more time to do some test on it.\n\nIt appears that Meteor runtime is too much for my old mbp, this might take a while . I didn't see this bug with running Wekan with source code, what's you guys' environment?. ROOT_URL is for the address of the whole web app, but you can only set SMTP related info(MAIL_URL & MAIL_FROM) in admin panel as far as I know, the functionality of admin panel would have no side effect on \"ROOT_URL\" setting.. About the error msg when invitation code doesn't exist, I'm still working on it.\nWekan uses \"meteor-useraccounts\" package to implement the user signin/signup functionality, and it's really \"not development-friendly\" to customize, haven't find a safe and elegant way to customize the error msg.. This should be fixed in the latest update.. For the error of @iAdanos , it seems the mailbox setting is wrong, maybe you should check if you set the SMTP correctly.\n@boolsee Yes, consider this is a known bug, I believe I did mention consider this somewhere, the invitation code should be removed if email sending failed.. @iAdanos , are u using version later than 0.1.3?\nIf so, please be aware of this:\n1. Your input of SMTP setting in admin panel will compose a string to replace the old MAIL_URL=smtp://user:pass@mailserver.example.com:25/ env.\n1. If the fields of username and passworld are left blank, the string will be MAIL_URL=smtp://mailserver.example.com:25/\n1. Or, 501 error might cause by the syntax of \"TO\" value(destination address) is wrong.\nHope this will help you on the troubleshooting. The idea of @soohwa's is interesting, but with the \"first user is admin& admin panel\" feature, you can achieve the same goal. So, the \"from\" value in your setting is a name, instead of an email addr?\nif so, make sure your smtp host allows you to do this.. Are you using wekan version greater that 0.13?\nUsually the from would be like Thomas Anderson<thomas@anderson.com>.\nJust FYI, the value of the \"from\" field will be set into the MAIL_FROM env as before.. Thanks for comment, I tried follow the naming convention of the project Wekan itself, where I saw there is not this kinda rule about the name of a template should be plural, take components/boards/boardBody.jade as example.\n. The reason why I use \"setting\" instead of \"settings\" is that I want to make it clear that it publishes a singleton to the client, not a set of something, it's more like \"settings.public\", \"settings.singleton\", or something like that.\n. Yeah, there must be a better solution.\n. Sure, this is a typo, lol\n. Um, my original thought was there is a bunch of other \"more strict functionalities\" in strict mode, not only invitationOnly.\n. No, this is not that kind of publication, it's more like user-is-admin, but definitely not admin-users,\n. That's just an app password, no harm will be done, and it has been changed. I'll remove these 2 files from the diff\n. ",

We pulled a libreboard version from you all awhile back (months and months ago) - and have since been making our own modifications / changes for our company - so I can't do a direct pull from this repo.\nCan you direct me to exactly which changes on the Renaissance commit was what corrected the router issue? I'm assuming there were numerous other changes / fixes for other things you included on that commit.\nJeremy\n. I added keyboard maneuvering / shortcuts to be able to perform actions on lists/boards/cards.\nEx: up,down,left, right to maneuver through lists and cards (enter triggering opening the cards)\nAdding card search using the search input that was provided up on the top left. LDAP login was added for the sign up / login process with our local LDAP server. \nOther shortcuts:\n'b' = back to boards, 'a c' = add card, 'a l' = add list, 'r+' would allow a selected card to be ranked to a specific spot.\nJust things of that nature.\nThere are also background crons running which maintain what cards appear / labels assigned to cards / members.

    "kentonv": "More details: It appears LibreBoard displays its own sign-in dialog when a user other than the grain owner views the grain. Instead, it should trust Sandstorm's access control, and it should assume that anyone who arrives at the page is supposed to have access to the board (otherwise Sandstorm would have blocked them). It would actually be best to remove the accounts-password package entirely from the Sandstorm build.\n. Also, all authentication- and authorization-related knobs should be hidden or removed from the Sandstorm build. For example, setting a board public vs. private, all of the \"sign up for free\" banners, etc.\n. @mikkelking Would you be interested in making it a Sandstorm.io app? :) We (sandstorm team) are happy to help; come talk to us on our discussion group or IRC (#sandstorm on Freenode).\n. FWIW, Sandstorm plans to add LDAP support, possibly quite soon.\n. @jparyani is working on automatic updates in Sandstorm as we speak! (Not quite automatic, but rather you'll get a notification that an update is available.) But yes, for now you need to go back to the market and click \"install\" again.\n. @radomici - The recipient needs to sign in (and choose to reveal their identity) in order to get edit access. This is arguably a bug in Wekan, but it's unclear how Wekan should record an audit trail for an anonymous user.\n. @radomici do you have a grain backup zip that demonstrates the issue which you'd be willing to share with @mquandalle?\n. So, Sandstorm actually provides a name in X-Sandstorm-Username even for non-logged-in users. Currently that name is simply \"Anonymous User\", I think. Some day we might provide a more informative name based on the sharing graph -- for example if the board was shared by e-mail, we know the user's e-mail address even if they haven't logged in, and we could incorporate that into the display name. But we haven't thought much about this yet. Note that for anonymous users, Sandstorm does not send X-Sandstorm-User-Id, so there's no way to tell if two anonymous users are the same person. We could conceivably be able to tell if they're using the same sharing link, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are the same person (e.g. if the invite was sent to a mailing list, posted in a chat, etc.).\nUnfortunately since the user isn't logged in they don't get a Meteor user entry and so getting at the headers may be hard, though it seems like you managed to do so for avatars even before I added explicit support for that to accounts-sandstorm. :)\n. @mitar As I said on IRC, an app can easily fall back to X-Sandstorm-Tab-Id when there is no X-Sandstorm-User-Id as a way to get the effect of ephemeral users. However, not all apps want that effect, therefore we cannot just do this for everyone. It's only a line or two of code to do this in your app. I would accept a PR against accounts-sandstorm which adds the ability to enable such a mode as an option.\n. > X-Sandstorm-Tab-Id has bad usability. If somebody has grain opened in multiple browser windows/tabs they would not be the same user.\nThat's working as intended. Anonymous users are anonymous.\n\nCan you please\n\nI'm really sorry, but I can't. We've spent a lot of time debating this point already (in other places) and I need to move on to other things.\n. If we let the /sandstorm part leak now, does that mean we can never remove it without breaking a lot of existing links? It seems worthwhile to fix that now rather than get stuck with a bad URL schema.\n. Hmm, this seems a little bit different from #443. I'm not asking for the columns to scroll while I'm dragging. I'm just trying to move a card from one column into the currently-visible area of another column, but it simply doesn't work if that other column's currently scroll position is beyond its first page.\n. @xet7 Possibly OT, but FWIW I think moving cards across boards would make sense for Sandstorm, but may need to be implemented differently. You could maybe do it with HTML5 drag-and-drop, or through the Powerbox.. @mquandalle Great to hear from you! I hope you don't mind that we made an edit on the Sandstorm side permitting us to sign Wekan releases with a new key. We tried to contact you first, but didn't hear anything.\nWe did this so that we could push some interesting new Sandstorm integration features: You can now assign people to a card even if they've never visited the board before (through the identity-picker powerbox), and Wekan's activity feed now feeds into Sandstorm and can generate notifications to users who don't have the board open.. @xet7 TL;DR: Sandstorm should not block this update.\nnode-capnp has a node4 branch which is actually now the default branch. Note that Sandstorm apps cannot use capnp from npm due to Sandstorm requiring unreleased features. But, we actually bundle a working copy of the capnp module into meteor-spk, so require()ing it should \"just work\" without declaring any explicit dependency -- as if it were a Node builtin.\nYou will, though, need to update to the latest meteor-spk in order to support Meteor 1.4+. I suppose Wekan must currently be building with a previous version of meteor-spk since it's still on Meteor 1.3.\n@dwrensha probably has more context on this than I do.. FWIW, the ideal way to handle \"imports\" on Sandstorm would be to have a separate new-grain action. Currently there is only \"New board\", but you could also have \"Import board\", which launches directly into an import UI. It feels a bit awkward to create a blank board and then import over it.\nHowever, I'm not sure it's worth your time to try to make this work.. I wonder if you want a /grain// link, or a /shared// link? That is, is a user usually intending to send the link to someone who already has access to the board, or are they wanting to implicitly grant access to whomever receives the link?\nI tend to think the latter. In that case, the right thing to do might be to use the \"share\" postMessage() API, which opens the sharing dialog. We could perhaps extend that API with the ability to specify a path, which would then be appended to the generated sharing link.. Arguably, in theory, Wekan's display of board participants is redundant with Sandstorm's own \"who has access\" dialog. By that theory, Wekan ought simply to not show the list.\nHowever, Sandstorm's UX here is clearly much worse than Wekan's at present, making this not a very good suggestion. Perhaps Sandstorm's UI could be improved in the future, maybe along with the top bar refactor, and then Wekan could hide its own UI.\nWe could also consider giving grains a way to be notified when users lose access, or to detect who currently has access, but at present I don't really know what would be the best API here. I don't think we want to expose the full sharing graph and model to apps since it may change and it's complicated, but I worry that if we try to expose something simpler, there will be weird edge cases where it's not really correct.. It seems like you're successfully doing the things you need to do on Sandstorm to talk to a grain API. The errors are coming from Wekan, not Sandstorm.\nWith that said, it's likely that you'll want to change the way the Wekan API is authorized on Sandstorm. Sandstorm will automatically add headers to the API requests identifying the user -- the same headers it adds to all HTTP requests. https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/auth/#headers-that-an-app-receives\nThe X-Sandstorm-User-Id header in particular contains the Sandstorm identity ID, which matches the field services.sandstorm.id in the user record in Mongo. So you can figure out who the user is that way, instead of requiring a separate login step.. I get the \"unauthorized\" error on both Oasis and self-hosted. This looks like a problem on the app side.\nHow are you deciding if the request is authorized? You should probably be looking at the x-sandstorm-permissions header, or look up the user from x-sandstorm-user-id.\nHere's the only code in Wekan which I can find that looks at either header:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/cb099d10933041d3c5814495e1dbf288e1d67ec6/sandstorm.js#L326-L340\nWill the above set authorization as needed for API requests? If not, you may need to add similar code in the API implementation.. Doesn't ring any bells for me. Sandstorm's own upgrade to node 8 went pretty smoothly. But I guess your problem indicates that GridFS has a compatibility issue.\nDid you try wrapping it in try/catch? Or does the process just exit/crash outright?. I mean put try { where you have the first console.log and } catch (err) { console.log(err); throw err; } at the second. Since you know execution stops somewhere in between there.\nIf that doesn't catch anything -- and the process doesn't exit, as you said -- then it must be getting stuck.. Hi @xet7,\nYou may want to check out: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/3006\nMeteor changed the way require() looks up modules, and so it will no longer find the capnp module that is bundled by meteor-spk. I think you can fix this by doing require(\"/node_modules/capnp.js\") instead of require(\"capnp\").\nNote that from the errors you posted, it looks like you may have declared the capnp npm module as a dependency in your package.json. You actually should not do this, because it causes Meteor to try to download and build the capnp module from npm, but it will get the wrong version, and it probably won't build unless you install capnp and other things. meteor-spk already bundles in a precompiled copy of the capnp module, so treat it like a built-in module -- don't declare a dependency.. @xet7 Right, the capnp module is included in meteor-spk. You don't need to install it nor declare any dependency on it, it's just there.\nI don't understand either why it isn't working... :/.

We'd probably have to run it in a debugger or strace to find out what exactly it did leading up to the failure. It is surprising that Sandstorm itself (which uses Mongo, after all) worked fine, and only inside Wekan did something go wrong.. @xet7 asked me to comment.\nSorry, I don't have any ideas. This seems to me like it must be some sort of migration bug in Wekan. I can't imagine how Sandstorm could have caused it.. ",

    "martinhbramwell": "I really would like to be of assistance.  Please try to identify some parts of Libreboard where I could start contributing.\n. It looks like my first task would be authorization.\nRestivus seems to go only as far as authentication of a remote client.  Trello provides 3rd party authorization, whereby users can permit services like Slack to dig into their Trello account, on their behalf. \nFor example, this link, opened by a user, would ask them to accept that \"My+Application\" have free use of their libreboard account for 30 days : \nhttps://www.mylibreboard.com/1/authorize?name=My+Application&key=My+Application+Key&expiration=30days&response_type=token\nI don't see that functionality in restivus.  Is there a more advanced alternative? If not, my first task contributing to libreboard may turn out to be a collaboration on restivus to duplicate the functionality of Trello's \"authorize\" method.\nbtw, There is a NodeJS wrapper library available on GitHub that would facilitate validating our efforts to duplicate Trello's OAuth steps.\nI can work out those details if they are not already addressed, but I would like to know what you think.\n. Hmmm.\nOn that page you mention -- ( Exporting HTTP APIs )  -- I see a remark : In the future, we will implement an OAuth flow allowing a third party to initiate a request for access to the user's apps. \nI had only heard of Sandstorm a few days ago, and don't really have a clear idea of the scope of their offering, but I can see why you'd prefer to wait for Sandstorm to implement it.\nHowever, clearly, not all Libreboard projects will run on Sandstorm, so that begs the question : does the design of restivus permit or prohibit implementing 3rd party authorization in the future?  If it cannot be made to do it, how horrible will it be to rip out restivus and replace it with something else?\n(just playing devil's advocate here)\n. Huh.  I just looked the code of restivus.  It's quite small really, so perhaps there's nothing to be concerned about.  I think I would like to tinker with it a bit and try to get an idea of how hard/easy it will be to use.\n. \"... tend to assume you're talking to a known centralized entity on one side of the equation (Google, Facebook, Github, etc.) \"\nOr Trello, for that matter, no?\nThe question is whether the Libreboard community is panting for an API, an authenticated API or a full-fledged 3rd party authorized API?\n. I think I am going to do the following : \n1. Set up node-trello, the NodeJS wrapper library for the Trello API (that I mentioned earlier) and try to manipulate my own Trello acct with it, just to get familiarized.\n2. Set up a completely bare bones restivus server and attempt to configure it to respond coherently to calls into it from node-trello.\n3. See if adding 3rd party authorization to restivus is viable\n4. Take what I've learned and start in on some initial calls of the API for Libreboard\n5. Make a test suite out of node-trello and get it green for those initial calls.\n6. Invite the libreboard community to help turn the rest of it green.\n. I hope we are not talking at cross-purposes.  The way I see it Libreboard targets a niche of people who want to run their own Trello and have total control over how it behaves.    If Trello runs its own OAuth service, then Libreboard should too.  Is that idea blinding me to a deeper issue?\n. @mquandalle \nSo ... a progress report.\nI have created a screen scraper to create a Swagger document from the Trello API documentation.  You can review it using the Swagger UI ...\n- go to the address :  Swagger UI Demo\n- in the field at the top of the page replace the Pet Store API file URI with my Trello API file URI\nI think you'll agree that it's far superior to this indecent shambles\nI have begun to create a Meteor package that wraps the Swagger JS library.  \"... the fastest way to enable a javascript client to communicate with a swagger-enabled server\".  On Meteor startup it will publish the entire Trello API as developer friendly commands like Trello.board.getBoardById or Trello.card.getCardsMembersVotedByCard(). \nI am doing this so that ...\n- we can create a Meteor test tools suite using the Swagger JS library that pre-validate tests of the Libreboard API against the Trello API.\n- we can generate the Libreboard server-side API from the Trello swagger file and stub all the bits that have yet to be developed.\n- we can ensure that anyone with an API client for Trello can use it unaltered to interact with Libreboard.\n- we can ensure that anyone with a Libreboard installation can fully interact with anyone else's Libreboard installation.\nUnfortunately I have hit an obstacle.  Perhaps the Javascript and NodeJS wizards in this community can help me get past it.  Am I pushing Meteor._wrapAsync beyond what it can do?\nYou can see the test code in GitHub and the test results in Travis.\nThoughts?\n. Further report . . .   I solved the wrap_Async problem, and was obliged to focus on other things for a while.\nHowever since my prior report was completely ignored without apology or explanation, I have to assume my participation here is unwelcome.  It might not be a deliberate insult, but it sure feels like one.\n. Thank you for your clarifications. I now realize, pink about the ears, that I'm annoyed about something else entirely unrelated and let it leak into my reading of this situation.\nA Swagger specification is machine readable, so the NodeJS module I wrap for Meteor automatically creates local functions that are immediately callable as proxies for the remote API.  Change the spec, reload it and the functions change to match.\nYou can generate server side code just as easily.  So, I plan to generate both Wekan's server side REST API methods, and unit tests for each one, from the same Swagger spec I used to create the client side.\nWith that done, it should be possible to throw the entire thing open to Wekan's community stating, \"Here are 300 or more API methods, 10% of which test green.  We'd be most grateful if you'd pick a red one, code it green and submit a PR.\" \n. @mquandalle Thank you for clarifying your situation.  I would like read up on  Relay and Falcor.

I need this too \ud83d\udc4d \nHow can we achieve this ? plugins ? cause many template are involved.... Hi,\nSo this feature only cover css & images, not templates ?. Hi,\nI'm trying to develop it.\nDesign \nAdd new menu entry (I'm actually planning in provide a list of available custom field names)\n\n\nThen, display it (quick UI only to POC)\n\nIs it what we need ?\nthanks,\n. Hi\n\nThe 'Custom field' title seems redundant, instead it could just be the field name as the h3 and the value below it.\n\nIn my mind, the first field (CustomFieldName) should be a select, where the user can select a predefined custom field, and then the second field is its value\n\nWhat's the limit on number of custom fields that can be created?\n\nNo limit, since a Card have X custom fields (i think, we should create a new Collection to store that information)\nI checked : http://blog.trello.com/trello-custom-fields.\nMaybe we should start small : to be trello-like, we need an Admin Ui to build all customs fields, and finally a new entry in card's menu\nWhere can we add new UI to create customs field ? . @jlouzado : i will joint you later.\n\u00ce am trying to copy Trello. It's ok for th\u00e9 UI, but i struggle on the new mod\u00e8l to create.\nIs someone able to Help me or available to develop this pi\u00e8ce ?\nThanks    . Hi,\nIt's a work in progress : https://github.com/tugal/wekan\nThe model piece is quite complicated for a meteor newbie like me :). @xet7 : Do you want us to check this PR ? this one is not related to custom fields. Hi\nWhat is the workflow associated? have somewhere a checklist admin, and add a button \"Import Checklist\" in the card ?\nWhat is the best UX/UI for this feature..\nI have the same use case, but i'm not sure if i need a bulk creation of checklist or create cards from a model (which contains checklist)\n. Hi,\nCould we start by just adding a way to enable devs to update css ?\nUsing <meteor-bundled-css />, and next to it <CustomCss>/> wich guarantee that CustomCss will be load after bundled css..\nRedesign will be simpler after that, and devs could also share their css..\nMy 2 cent's\nNelson. @xet7 great :)\n. @Usernameisalreadytaken99 \nWhat do you mean by \"to minimize the number of items in the menu\" ?\n-> Delete this actions ?\n-> Add params to hide these actions ? . Hey\nmkdir -p ~/repos/wekan/packages\ncd ~/repos/wekan/packages\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/wekan-ldap.git wekan-ldap\ngit clone https://github.com/wekan/accounts-cas.git accounts-cas. > Great ! Thank you for this PR. Very usefull. One question though, what's the difference between \"Show this field on card\" which right now display the field with its value on the mini card and \"Show label on mini card\" ?\nAccording the code, Show this field on card => enable the custom field to be displayed on the mini card (without gouing on detail panel)\nShow label on mini card => for my project, i need to only show the custom field \"value\" and not the \"label\" .. \nLet me know if \"Show label on mini card\" is useful for the community or not :)\nMy next cents will be working on new custom fiels type => Map, etc.... hi @xet7 \nWhat do you think about these features ?\nAre they useful ?\nThanks\nNelson. fine @xet7 . @xet7 \nYes take it :) you are doin a great job :).

Hello, so I take a look this morning, and after cleanup all my images and volumes, same behaviour. The WebApp do nothing, and the db is empty.. Yes, I went inside. \nI currently looking for a coworker for testing this issue. And I come back a coworker has tested it.. Hi @xet7,\nI asked for a coworker that confirmed it's work with a fresh docker install.\nSo the docker is not idempotent, but why ? oO. I probably found the explanation, is come from my entreprise proxy, a websocket connection pass through a proxy is blocked. I have to find a solution for that #916 or I will add a ssl server inside the docker compose.. https://travis-ci.org/wekan/wekan/builds/221999058#L5338\nwhy 'Oo ..... I have no error for me : https://gist.github.com/huneau/12dc9bdf5b3fbb4839541187b4416897\nI think is just an itinerant bug. I will push a modif and it's will work. hey, it's compile, just a network bug ... nothing important\nnow I need to change my email address from commit -_-. I have signed the license, why it won't validate it.. Hi, \nI do nothing important, \n- dependencies\n  - npm install winston\n  - mpn install winston-zulip\n\nmeteor to run without any other options\n\nThe build is ok, so the dependencies should be here oO.. > I need all steps of cloning repo, installing node.js version, and versions of other dependencies to reproduce working version of wekan.\n``` shell\ngit clone https://github.com/huneau/wekan.git\ncd wekan/\ngit checkout meteor-1.4-LOGGER\nfor the rest nothing change\nsudo npm -g install npm@latest\nsudo npm -g install node-gyp\nsudo npm -g install fibers\nnpm install\nmeteor\n ```\nI have added a few environment variable : \n```shell\nexport LOGGER_ENABLE=< true || false >\nLOGGERS => list of logger type, concatenate with a comma\nactually supported 'console', 'file','zulip' (zulip is my use case)\nexport LOGGERS=console,file\nFor Console nothing any settings needed\nFor File\nFile will be create logs/\nexport LOGGER_FILE_NAME=\nFor Zulip\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_USERNAME=\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_APIKEY=\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_REALM=\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_TO=\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_SUBJECT=\n```\nI think that's it.\n\nhow do I test your feature and see how it works?\n\nFor console\nshell\nexport LOGGER_ENABLE=true\nexport LOGGERS=console\nFor file\nshell\nexport LOGGER_ENABLE=true\nexport LOGGERS=file\nexport LOGGER_FILE_NAME=server.log #create if not exist\nFor both\nshell\nexport LOGGER_ENABLE=true\nexport LOGGERS=console,file\nexport LOGGER_FILE_NAME=server.log #create if not exist\nFor zulip is a bit more complex\nProject : https://github.com/galexrt/docker-zulip\n```shell\nWEKAN CONF\nexport LOGGER_ENABLE=true\nexport LOGGERS=zulip\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_USERNAME=\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_APIKEY=\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_REALM=\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_TO=\nexport LOGGER_ZULIP_SUBJECT=\n\nZULIP INSTALLATION\ngit clone https://github.com/galexrt/docker-zulip.git\ncd docker-zulip/\nreplace SETTINGS_* variables\nvi docker-compose.yml\ndocker-compose up -d\nafter is a zulip webapp config for bot and apikey etc etc\n```\n\nWhat menu options are new?\n\nAny menu has been changed.\n\ndoes it integrate with something?\n\nI use Zulip here, but if you don't call it in environment variable you need nothing else.\n\ncommands to use to test it ?\n\nNothing, just plays with wekan and you will see logs appear where you have specified them.\nIf you need more, just ask and I will try to respond quickly as possible.\nThinks.\n. Hi,\nI'm sorry this is a debug message from serveur/logger.js\n(I'm at a wedding, I can't help right now). https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/logger.js#L11\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/logger.js#L12\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/logger.js#L14\nThis is lines to remove. . @xet7 done!\n@mayjs I take the easiest way for me to create an API, I haven't the knowledge on Meteor to use restivus.. Hi there,\nI fix #1032 \nI use https://atmospherejs.com/simple/rest-accounts-password it's pretty simple to use is.\nTo use api you should get a token\nPOST /users/login or POST /users/register (not /api in front).\nWith in payload for /login\njson\n{\n  \"username\": \"huneau\",\n  \"password\": \"my awesome password\"\n}\nOr for /register\njson\n{\n  \"username\": \"huneau\",\n  \"email\": \"example@mail.com\",\n  \"password\": \"my awesome password\"\n}\nThis thing will return a token where you have to put it everywhere. \njson\n{\n  \"token\": \"string\",\n  \"tokenExpires\": \"ISO encoded date string\",\n  \"id\": \"user id\"\n}\nJust add your token to your reauest header like Authorization: Bearer <token>\nor \njavascript\nHTTP.post(\"/api/resources\", {\n  headers: { Authorization: \"Bearer \" + token }\n}, function (err, res) {\n  console.log(res.data);\n});\n/!\\ Just keep in mind ONLY admin user can use RESTAPI.. @mayjs I work for an employer, I have no roadmap no lists of features. \nI will maintain bugfix my own code but I don't spend the time to add a feature which is not decided by my product owner.\nUp to you to contribute :). > POST /api/boards/:boardId/lists/:listId/cards could be extended to be able to update existing cards by giving an ID in the posted object. (Or to stay restful, add POST /api/boards/:boardId/lists/:listId/cards/:cardId)\nUpdate = PUT\n\nPOST /api/user/cards could be used to return cards using a filter. (E.g. get all cards that are in the leftmost list or have a certain tag etc.) This feature could allow a client to get all cards to be done by the logged in user without requesting all cards on all boards first.\n\nthis is GET with parameter /api/users/cards?name=awesomecard\n\nMaybe create special admin endpoints, e.g. to get every board. Some of these endpoints already exist, like POST /api/users\n\nActually, I have hard coded the filter to get board, just remove my hard coded filter and use parameter filter.\nAnd keep in mind best pratice: \nhttps://blog.mwaysolutions.com/2014/06/05/10-best-practices-for-better-restful-api/\n. Hi @mayjs,\nI not sure about that GET /api/user/boards this is not RESTFUL.\nYou use the request.userId to get the user but in REST you should use GET/api/users/:userId/boards\nOtherwise it's good for me.. you have missed a s to /user. Hi, \n@mayjs I'm looking notifications and I respond when I can. \nOtherwise, I've got a coworker that work on this project (don't know his pseudo).\nAnyway, I transfer this issues to my coworker, because he will probably impact.. yes, I disable it, because of path. You can probably choose a tmp path ? . Hi, this is exactly the code I have commented. I was asking to my boss for time to fix that but I think the solution is enough.. I'm looking in my pull request changes files, I see nothing about this menu : \nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1003/files\nI continue to find in my changes.. The issue is here: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/server/logger.js#L14\nI can't add a Console logger because it's already existe. I should delete the logger before adding it.. ",

    "genecraig": "@danger89 :\nBecause like most programmers out there their ego (read \"exaggerated self-confidence in areas they have no professional experience in\") makes them think they can do UI/UX themselves rather than hire a professional. And we all suffer from it. Wekan is an ok project, but very deficient for its age and plagued with really simple problems that should have been ironed out much earlier on. Again, these would have been discovered had they also hired QA. This is the repeated downfall of many projects, perhaps in the area of 90% - refusal to hire QA and UI/UX professionals. But no one learns from anyone else' mistakes - and we ALL suffer, at least in wasting time finding out the project is garbage and will remain garbage longer than I have time to wait for.. This project has been up here 2 years and we still cannot DELETE boards or lists. All programmers understand CRUD, the four most basic, elementary, and initial routines you create for your database. CREATE, RETRIEVE, UDPATE, and... you've got it... DELETE!!! It is as if they expect their product to only be used for a very short time and not very much. Why would you want to delete anything? You won't use it much anyway = their mentality. Please get with the 21st century. Add delete to the elements of the program. For heaven's sake! I have a trash bin sitting by my desk. I can throw anything I want in it and take out the trash. Give us the same with Boards and Lists.. @ocdtrekkie like any other project or startup, investments. Oh, that's right, that would require bringing a business professional onboard and programmers think they can do everything themselves. You have a startup and you don't have money, you get investments. This is the normal course of business around the world.\nAnd don't be infantile by calling a person a troll for having an opinion. It is constructive criticism. If you can't take constructive criticism then what are you doing here?. 2 years and we cannot delete boards? ABSURD!. @ocdtrekkie definition of trolling is to follow someone around online commenting on their comments. This is what you have just done from one thread to another. STOP!\nAnd this is NOT a charity. You are using the public for free QA. We are doing part of your work for your projects and your compensation is allowing us to use the product in its half-baked state. If you don't want criticism then why did you put your projects on GitHub? It is NOT charity. You are so ungrateful for the work the public does on YOUR intellectual property without any payment.. ",
    "alayek": "I am interested in working on this. \nI looked into the blog posts provided above. And Googled a few references.\nIt seems, to deploy this app, we need to get a cartridge of node v0.10, then install mongo on the cloud box; finally execute a shell script to package and deploy the app. It may be doable, but I am not sure at the moment, how to incorporate all this in one-click deployment.\nThis is the reference.\nThere is another way to do this - we deploy the docker image. I am not well-versed with one-click docker deployment; some pointers would be of help. \n. Ok, but if we have two repos, wouldn't it be a challenge to keep them in sync? I don't know if there are webhooks that triggers any script in other repos.\n. I am interested in working on this. I could use some help though. \nWhat are the edge cases?\n. hi @jseadragon and @mquandalle, I started working on this issue. Hope that's ok.\nI have already gotten the Jade and Stylus changes, with i18n strings; and I need a bit of help with the filtering logic. I have already posted in the gitter channel. Please check.\n. @jseadragon yeah, I also have a demanding day job, and I am barely finding any time to contribute. I understand where you have been coming from.\nThere was this one issue I was earlier working on, #441. But it proved to be tough and I also posted this on Stack Overflow regarding this issue.\nYou might want to check out.\n. hi @mquandalle and @floatinghotpot, I have decided to take this on. I am planning to raise a PR to resolve this.\nI would like to present my approach briefly for review.\nThe invite email provides the new user an URL of the form /b/:board_id/:board_name_slug/. I am planning to create a new route to render a different template; something like /b/join/:board_id/:board_name_slug/.\nAs of now, my plan is to create a new route in config/router.js; and render the template for joining the service (registration).\nBut I have a question - should this new incoming / onboarding user be able to join the board like any other member? The inviter specified an email ID; so the template cannot allow for the new joinee to edit the email ID, and let them sign up with a different email ID.\nFor instance, say I sent a request to let abc@abc.com to join my board. And then, when abc opens the joining page, he should join with the email ID abc@abc.com, not something else.\nThis would also help the system keep track of whether or not invited person joined.\nAnother way to achieve this (email verification on invite based joining) would be to use some special URL (I am not sure what the name is, but it's kind of like URLs sent in emails which confirms the email ID) in the invite.\nThe server would be able to keep track of who is joining, and notify the inviter that the invitee has joined. \nIf the invitee uses different email from the one used by inviter, to sign up for the application, we would just send another confirmation email to his choice of email ID.\n. When a user adds another user by Email ID, the new user gets added to the board with userID as the email ID, before the @ symbol. Their email ID gets created as the email ID provided by the user.\n@araczkowski, currently we are planning for it to be like this - \n- An invited person receives the email.\n- The link in the email takes her to changePassword or resetPassword route, as the user only needs to pick a password.\n- Once the password is set, the user is taken directly to the board she was invited to.\n@mquandalle, should it be changePwd or resetPwd?\n. Thanks @mquandalle for merging. My first open-source commit!\n. +1\n. Ok removing.\n. ",
    "araczkowski": "I have a wekan clone on OpenShift Online (v2) PaaS, my installation is based on this Meteor cartridge https://github.com/sachinbhutani/meteor-openshift\nso I can confirm that this way is possible and not so difficult \nthe pre-configured wekan application for OpenShift should be probably in a separate repository and in the pull request to the wekan the launch button can be provided (with correct initial_git_url) in the README.md:\n[![LAUNCH ON OpenShift](http://launch-shifter.rhcloud.com/launch/LAUNCH ON.svg)](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/application_type/custom?&cartridges[]=nodejs-0.10&initial_git_url=https://github.com/ryanj/launch-service.git&name=launch)\n\nDocker containers are not available on the current (v2) version of OpenShift Online. They are available on OpenShift Origin (which is currently v3)  / OpenShift Dedicated PaaS\n. I just want to add, that when I described this issue, my case was that I've received only the \"InviteToBoard\" email - I didn't receive the \"enrollAccount\" email.\nThat is why I was so confused...\nWhen I checked this again (for new account) I recived first the \"enrollAccount\" then the \"InviteToBoard\" message. So now this is not so strange as it was for the first time. \nOf course there is still a big chance that new user will first click on the link from the \"InviteToBoard\" message (the most recent message).\nTo improve this case maybe we can:\n1. add a userId to the \"InviteToBoard\" url\n2. when the user will go to this url, we can check if the account (via the userId from url) was already enrolled\n3. if yes we can redirect to the board url (or to the login page if the board is private), if no we can redirect to the  \"enrollAccount\" for this particular user (userId) \nBut this are details, now when I received the \"enrollAccount\" I don't mind if you close this issue - it is up to you.\n. in my opinion the full offline mode will be great :+1: , especially on mobile devices\nfor the data this can be usefull https://github.com/GroundMeteor/db\nand for the app maybe this https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/appcache\nof course not everything will be possible (register new user for example) \nbut still it will be a super feature \n. hi,\nsince: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/449 it should be OK\nplease try\njavascript\nmeteor update mquandalle:jquery-ui-drag-drop-sort\n. I checked on my android device (nexus 5) it's ok - the click if fired after one touch \nthe same in the browser, when the \"Emulate mobile\" is ON\nmaybe you have iPhone, or the browser cache has old js ... or I don't know ;) \n\n. it will be even better if we will have \"icon labels\" (Font Awesome)\n.

    "mikkelking": "To me this is a fairly significant bug - I was editing a card, spent some time doing so, switched browser tabs to look at something else, when I came back I inadvertently clicked somewhere else and my changes were lost. Autosave would be good, or at least a warning dialog\n. I agree, great for managing multiple workstreams or projects\n. I agree, I extended MypersonalKanban (written in Angular) to do precisely this, and the result is fantastic, because as kentonv says, it allows you to visualise the cards and manipulate them from different perspectives.

I have got a preview going for PDFs using PDFJS. I can render a PDF preview to a canvas element anywhere. \nAs far as the UI, would something similar to the image preview be ok? Something like a modal that a user could flip through a PDF.\nAs far as ViewerJS, I found a issue 207 which shows that other users also can't find a package. Someone commented about a forked one, but it was a couple of forks down and hasn't been updated in a while. It also didn't have many downloads. .

FYI, on the 1st October the Node.js Foundation will end support for Node.js v0.10.\n. Thank you @xet7 . @xet7 Thanks. I'll update my Wekan. I will try tonight.. @xet7 I tested https://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases/download/v0.11.1-rc1/wekan-0.11.1-rc1.tar.gz and it seems I no longer have this issue. You can close it. Thanks!!. @xet7 Do you have some documentation around the Wekan API?. @xet7 Ok, Thank you! I will update Wekan to the last master source code, then I will answer precisely your question.. It is a big issue. I can reproduce it.. Great. But I still have issues with checklists. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1090. Same issue happened after having archived a load of cards on a single board. I can no longer load some boards. The database seems now corrupted.. I'm sure Wekan now desserves a new release with this great added feature.. @xet7 Hi. What will be the recommended Node.js version now?. @nztqa For you, I don't know at least for now. But I am using Chrome last version 61.0.3135.4 (Official Build) dev (64-bit).. Thank you @summea for your support and your thoughts.. @nztqa Thank you!!. @xet7 I believe with this great PR, we can release a 0.29 version of wekan :).

And connect to mongo, and do: \n\ndb.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: \"3.4\" } ) \n\nAnd then remove MongoDB 3.4 and install MongoDB 3.6 again...to make Wekan work again.. It should be interesting to be able to disable the Oidc feature & button directly in the Wekan config.. @xet7 Thank you. But can we also disable this button/feature?\nThanks. ",

    "gwillen": "@alayek Well, I'm interested in this feature in the context of Sandstorm, where each instance of the running app has exactly one board. So for this feature to work for me (obviously not the only person who wants it), it has to be possible to move cards between different copies of the app -- which may not share the same users, tags, etc.\nI tried for a while to hack this in using the existing Trello import support -- copying a card to the clipboard, effectively, and pasting it into a new board. The existing Trello import can do things like letting you map the source board's users onto the destination board's users when importing a card.\nBeing able to do this by dragging would require HTML5 drag-and-drop, which seems like it would mean replacing all the drag-drop in the app with HTML5 drag-drop, which is probably a lot of work. That's why I thought the clipboard seemed like a nice workaround.\n. I think I might have been one of the users who prompted Kenton to mention this (he or someone else in #sandstorm suggested this approach when I asked about moving cards between boards.)\nBecause I'm using Wekan on Sandstorm, I think I can't be helped by plugin solutions that involve enumerating boards, since boards on Sandstorm are not expected to be able to see each other. So HTML5 drag-n-drop seems like the only simple method for accomplishing this (without having to create new Sandstorm capabilities for boards to communicate.)\nOne stopgap I thought of was a two-or-three-step process: Use jquery D&D (or a menu on the card) to move the card to a holding area (perhaps represented as a small icon somewhere in the UI); then use HTML5 D&D to drag the card from the holding area on one board and drop it into the other board (perhaps via another holding area). This is annoying UX-wise, but would minimize required changes to the app (which is why it was the most tempting approach if I was going to try to implement it myself.) It would mean not using HTML5 D&D for most card movement, which would preserve your existing UX for most purposes.\n. Thank you! This is awesome! :+1:\n. Question: Does it make sense for us (in production usage of wekan) to build and run devel to get this feature? Or would it be smarter to wait for a new release?

By your directions I did mv data /tmp/\na little digging to find the volume (turned out to be the first in .../docker/volumes)\nmv /var/lib/docker/volumes/$OLD_VOLUME_ID/_data data\nThanks again a thousand times!\n. Is there any ETA for the final release?\n. +1, We'd also like to have this allowed in the admin panel. \nUpdate: You can still scroll if you put the mouse cursor on top of the card list, but it should really work for the whole page IMO.\n. I just updated from the latest image in docker half an hour ago, so this is up-to-date:\nroot# docker pull mquandalle/wekan:latest\nStatus: Image is up to date for mquandalle/wekan:latest\nEDIT: Oh, I was doing the mquandalle docker. Will check with quay, that seems to update. Hmm, now I have the latest docker build from quay and the same behavior repeats. Can only start scrolling when my mouse is on the active card. Cannot see any scrollbar between card display and sidebar.\nTested this on Edge, and scrolling from the middle of the screen does work there. I'm currently of the latest Firefox Nightly, and the guys that reported this to me are on the latest Firefox default build.\n. Just for closure: this is fixed now in 0.80. Can confirm this, I had the same issue but adding profile.boardView = 'board-view-lists' to the database allowed the user to see the contents again. ",
    "koorg": "I think the way \"public\" boards are not seen by any existing user (they need to be invited to see the board), is more a bug than a feature, it doesn't \"feel\" public...

It feels like wekan export / wekan import is meant to work at the moment.\nWe tried to export from a docker instance and import to a wekan dev branch, but it still seems to have an issue with user mapping, then triggs an error \"Your JSON data does not include the proper information in the correct format\".

    "TiibCD": "UP +1 to this feature. I agree I think the way public boards work at the moment doesn't feel \"public\" like we are used to.\nThe fact that we can share a public board via a link is great but, as a logged user to see all the public boards and my private board seems logic to me. Otherwise, the setting \"public\" won't be used often ...\nAny idea if someone took this feature on ?. Good idea to separate boards into category ! But how do you categorize a board as a subtask board ? As sometimes users define their \"master board\" as the subtask board aswell.\nThe message in the visibility menu with the \"private or public\" setting should be changed to let users know that a public board would be seen by all others users. Hi all,\nIndeed it would be great to have dependencies between cards. \nFor example Card A cannot move until all related cards aren't \"done\". Or just a feature to see a relation between cards parent/child would also be great like the \"Helloepics\" plugin. A notification bell ?. I imagine as in the activities something like \"user modified description\" or a before/after comparaison ?. Same problem with v1.00 and virtualbox appliance. @feuerball11 Thanks for your work ! I was taking a look at the code to correct it myself but I'm not used to Jade so glad you did it so fast.. I agree it would be nice to have the exact date instead of the relative date (which for me is useless). Great idea !. No one else is bothered by this issue ?. I agree this would be nice I had the same thought. I use custom fields filters all the time otherwise some boards are rapidly full with cards. Does anyone plan to work on this in the future ?. Okay ! Thanks for the clarification ! Indeed it was not intuitive for me but now it's more clear. I think  I understood it that way because I would have liked to have a different setting for landing list for each \"main board\". For example, if I have one board as store for tasks from many boards, I can set a landing list depending on each \"main board\".\nThank you for your help. If you don't want to see a card anymore you can also delete it instead of moving it to recycle bin.\nArchive vs recycle bin, I think this debate won't have an end. The most important is the way it works not the name :). I think he means to hide these actions from the \"Actions menu\" as all of theses actions are available with buttons in the card. Except the \"Edit custom fields\" action.\nAnother idea would be to hide the buttons by default in the card and add the option to display them in the Actions menu. I think trello works this way. By default no option is available and you activate in the action menu what you need. \nI think it can simplify the Action menu and the card UI\nImproved menu with submenu. The user can check the buttons he wants to see\n\nCard by default with no option\n\n. Thanks for your work \ud83d\udc4d . I updated my comment. @BurakTuran9 Thanks for your work in fixing this !. I tested some cases with the checklist feature in v1.85 and updated my post accordingly. Great ! Thank you for this PR. Very usefull. One question though, what's the difference between \"Show this field on card\" which right now display the field with its value on the mini card and \"Show label on mini card\" ?. > Show label on mini card => for my project, i need to only show the custom field \"value\" and not the \"label\"\nLet me know if \"Show label on mini card\" is useful for the community or not :)\nOk I understand now. Yes it can be useful to have the choice. Thank you for your work\n. Maybe this issue #1939 could also be related in a global discussion. Issue already discussed here #1972. Discussion listing all the issues regarding rules is already in progress here #1972. Hi, nice work ! Specially the swimlane and user filter ! Just for my information, is this a choice to have removed the \"when a card is removed\" trigger ?. I didn't know how we could help with translations. Thanks for the link. I'm happy to help if needed.. Hi !\nJust for comparaison, we have a docker installation (which for me, save some ressources) with 75+ users and the machine hosting it has 8gb of RAM and 8 CPU. The RAM free is 1gb.\nWe don't experience any interruption of service. > How do you plan to scale to 100, 200 or 500 users ?\n\nYou tried Snap before Docker and Docker is less resource consuming ?\n\nOur Wekan is going to migrate to a new server (which is just a wekan sandbox right now) with 32gb of ram so ressources will not be an issue.\nI didn't tried wekan with snap so I don't know if wekan with docker is less consuming, I just assumed with my personnal experience between the VM deployment method and the Docker solution. You can save some ressources of your computer without the OS emulation. Nothing to do with wekan. I agree but this option should be available per user ! In the end we need new roles like : superadmin, admin and user. I think there is already a discussion about this. ",

This may be because in ~/client/components/cards/cardDate.js editCardReceivedDatePopup and editCardEndDatePopup extend EditCardDate while editCardStartDatePopup and editCardDueDatePopup extend DatePicker.\nThis change was made in version 0.96 - I'm not sure if it was intentional, or a result of resolving merge conflicts.. To get around the issue of too many cards, could a board's recycle bin actually be a separate board?. Thanks for your patience @xet7 .\nI think I have addressed everything, but now Travis CI build has failed.\nI ran eslint using npm, and didn't get any errors.. Do you have an end date set?\n. ok, that is because of the logic\nif ((this.now.get().diff(this.date.get(), 'days') >= 2) &&\n       (this.date.get().isBefore(this.data().endAt)))\n      classes += 'long-overdue';\n    else if ((this.now.get().diff(this.date.get(), 'minute') >= 0) &&\n       (this.date.get().isBefore(this.data().endAt)))\n      classes += 'due';\n    else if ((this.now.get().diff(this.date.get(), 'days') >= -1) &&\n       (this.date.get().isBefore(this.data().endAt)))\n      classes += 'almost-due';\nwhere classes are only added if it is before the end date. The reasoning behind this is, if an end date is set, and it is before the due date, it isn't overdue.\nTo fix, we need to test if there is an end date. . As the code is right now, you are correct. However, I agree, it needs to be fixed.\nI can work on a fix soon.. Sorry @xet7, I think I did that twice in a row..

This is because of the lines\n Subtasks.remove({\n    cardId: doc._id,\n  });\nin the cardRemover function in models/cards.js. Off the top of my head there are two fixes:\na) if you are deleting cardA, you loop through all the cards with cardA as a parentId and delete them. If there are nested subtasks, this could get rather loopy.\nb) if you are deleting cardA, you loop through all the cards with cardA as a parentId and remove the parentID, making them top level cards - I'm not sure if this is a good idea.\nTo make either option work, the ability to assign a card as its own parent (#2202) would need to be addressed, or things could get messy.\n. > @rjevnikar\n\nDo you have time to try to fix this and #2202 ?\n\nI can, but it will be slow.

In v2.42 I found more placeholders that are not parsing their actual values to webhooks:\na) when moving a card from one lane to the other, __oldBoard__ is not parsed\nb) when adding a member to a card, __member__ and __list__ and __swimlane__ is not parsed\nc) act-setCustomField (and likely its counterparts when removing or editing a custom field) are also missing on the list I guess. They do not yet generate any translations and nothing is parsed at all. They will just simply be posted to webhooks without any relevant details whatsoever.. I don't think subtask boards should even be displayed on the boards page. There should be a new point \"subtasks\" (such as templates), and then the subtask boards should also be properly named and not all just called ^originalboardname^.\nThis looked so terribly wrong that I thought it was a database corruption and thereby I just deleted all subtasks of the user by getting rid of these boards.. This change has definitely made Wekan less beautiful. Previously, the scrollbar would only appear when hovering it (or when using the mouse wheel). Now all lanes with a number of tasks that require scrolling would always display a thick scrollbar next to them. Would it be possible to auto-hide the scrollbar when it is not used? Thanks to the design of Wekan we will not need a visible scrollbar to identify that there are more tasks available than shown on the screen.. ",

    "spacekookie": "Gitlab now has a kanban like board for issues in a gitlab project. Which is pretty cool. \nBut I would much rather keep using wekan because it makes it easy to work with people outside of gitlab projects. As well as just having a nicer UI.\nSo I was wondering, if it was possible to do something similar:\n- A card in wekan is either just a card or linked to an issue in the gitlab tracker\n- An issue in gitlab is either just an issue or (when tagged correctly) becomes a card in wekan.\nMoving a card in wekan changes the tag (labels) in gitlab.\nClosing the issue in gitlab either removes card from wekan or moves it to a \"done\" pile.\n. It's been a few months. I just recently started using wekan and I'd be very interested in this feature.\nCould somebody from the team maybe put an ETA or priority on this issue? As support for check lists is very vital for how I work :(\nThank you!\n. > lkisme has already done a really nice implementation, which you can fetch it from here forked repo. even detects and visualizes completion. only thing i wished for is reordering of task items.\nI would much rather not fiddle with our production setup to get a feature off a fork.

Released bounty to @andresmanelli , thanks lots for all the work. @xet7, I'll be waiting for https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/issues/19 before doing more extensive testing then.. Added a bounty on this issue. Please see https://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekan/issues ...\n. Added a bounty on this issue. Please see https://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekan/issues . Hey @tugal , I don't really have any strong opinions about how to implement this, so I'll just jot down some ideas/notes, if that's ok with you.\n\nas for the map provider: I guess people would love google better, but OSM deserves all support and exposure it can get, so i'd go for that.\nI'd default to using addresses and/or a freeform text (we also use room names within a given address), or a combination of these. Geoip could be optional (hidden somewhere onclick), I think geoip will be an edge usecase for the absolute majority of users. \nStoring/caching geoip equivalents of the addresses makes sense, if that's what you meant with #1993 ...\nI'd prefer an elegant solution that would include places (i.e. room within a building), but i can't really thing of a decent way but have two inputs and that feels like clutter to me.\nAs for displaying locations, i'd display the map inside the card detail and show just a text/link on the card). It might be interesting to optionally allow the map preview on the card itself (i.e. instead of a header picture), but that shouldn't be default behaviour (users who will use locations a lot would have their board swamped with visuals)\n\nhope this helps?\n. Added a bounty on this issue. Please see https://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekan/issues ...\nLet me know if I can provide details to further implementation of this.. Not sure if you guys noticed, mysql has had native support for json documents for over a year now also including a REST api built in into the database. IMO picking up support for mysql could be relatively easy + give anyone the luxury of combining things like joins, stored procedures and the whole sql thing including replication with the flexibility of a document store. Oh and performance is really good too.. @xet7 , that I won't be able to answer well with respect to Meteor.js - javascript is definitely not my strong point. Nontheless I've been using the mysql xdevapi and the builtin sql functions to manipulate and query json documents since the feature was available with python and php - never looked back. Js has been a first class citizen here with https://devhub.io/repos/mysql-mysql-connector-nodejs appearing right after the feature has been made available. . IMO Rethink is best suited for real-time apps such as chat. Has also some limitations https://rethinkdb.com/limitations/ i.e. with regards to unicode collations. While I still think Rethink is a better database then Mongo (https://rethinkdb.com/docs/comparison-tables/) I'd still target Mysql (even over postgres) - has all the features of a fully fledged sql database, can do json, has a CRUD api, does replication well, has pain-free upgrade paths (unlike most other databases where version bumps are a real PITA)..

Please see https://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekan/issues .... @xet7 , can't login to Bountysource with my Github account.

Bountysource didn't feel like replying me, so thanks lots for the tip. Bounty released to @GhassenRjab , thanks lots!. Added a bounty on this issue. Please see https://www.bountysource.com/issues/41780380-add-feature-teams-organizations-similar-to-trello. Also #1101 relevant to this issue.. It works ok. If there's a dev to pick this up, I'll follow through and throw in a \"major\" $10 bountysource to verify things right to the end.. Hey @xet7 , I took your initial description of this issue and expanded it slightly in the first list-item below, taking into account what might be a problem or what usecases come to my mind. I also added other items that are too far beyond this ticket's scope, but are connected somehow. \n\ntrello inspired calendar view https://blog.trello.com/enable-trello-calendar-mode consisting of\n[ ] weekly/monthly views, each with all cards stacked\n[ ] cards draggable and filterable (changes the dates) on cal view\n[ ] since we have both, differentiate between start and due date - not sure how about cards having both start-date and due-date defined, these would normally span multiple days in calendar apps, but that means we'll have to figure out a meaningful way to show that\n[ ] contrary to trello, i'd consider reserving 1/n-th of the right side of the screen for tasks with no due date (so a simple todo list with items ordered according to the date they were last modified or first created)\n[ ] caldav support (with authentication/autorization)\n[ ] caldav url for the whole board\n[ ] caldav url for a single user and all boards he/she participates\n[ ] cadav url for a part of a board identified by .... (tag, user, ...) \n[ ] notification support (send notification 1hr, 3hrs, 1day, 2days, 1week ... ahead of due date)\n[ ] card aging\nchange checklists and/or checklists items into new cards, move card to another board Whenever you deal with using a wekan-like tool to do some time-constraint scheduling, i.e. \"Build sand castle (due on 20/10/2017)\" and the task becomes complex over time, you can end up having almost a whole board on a single card. Right now, the only way to deal with this situation is to copy out things manually.\nodoo inspired events support #1101: Often when something has a due date and multiple people are assigned, you have some checkpoints/events along the way \"Build sand castle (due on 20/10/2017)\" i.e. \ninitial meeting (1/9/2017) in new york (location can be important too)\nsand delivery (15/9/2017)\ncheck if all's good and it seems we will finish on time (15/10/2017)\nsend out castle opening invites (16/10/2017)\nthat have to be recorded somewhere/somehow and eventually should show up on the calendar. also these events should be able to send notifications and should show up in the calendar view. We could bind these event data to checklist items too if the above point gets implemented.\nbidirectional caldav support (i.e. \"bind\" a google calendar onto a board/lane and display events)\nhaving teams implemented and seeing an overview of who of the members is free/unutilized (including data anonymization - if a team member is busy on tuesday on a board i'm not participating in, i should see that he's busy but shouldnt know why)\nadd card dependence (card x depends on card y)\nuse dependence and calendar data to get a gantt chart\nlist of tasks from all boards (can be already done via api)\n\nHope this paints the picture of a more complete time/scheduling implementation. If you'd like me to add more details just let me know.\n. And the bounty is here: https://www.bountysource.com/issues/41780513-add-feature-calendar-view , @xet7 , you're free to test the rest.. Firstly I'd add \n\nhttps://github.com/Serhioromano/bootstrap-calendar\nhttps://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/demoApps/\n\nto the possible libraries to use. dhtmlx and fullcalendar are the two most prominently used ones imho, so that would be probably the best way to go. AFAIK fullcalendar doesnt have caldav support, but I guess none will have that. dhtmlx has a gplv2 version and i think is more polished, but i never used it in a project.. @Creanimo, I developed an ERP that had all this and more included, so I may be having lots of ideas, some of them hopefully worthwhile for the wekan community (btw, if you like these features, you'll probably like #1160 as well). \nIf you'd join me in  adding a bounty on this on bountysource (see above), I'll top up my bounty too - sofar I testpledged only $10. I'll also gladly provide further feature/architecture tips and experiences to anyone who may find them useful, even though I'm quite limited by not being familiar with most technologies wekan is built upon.\nIf you wanna go faster, please note that @xet7 also wrote up an article on commercial devrequests too on the wiki. I'd definitely be glad if wekan would move even faster as I grew quite fond of it.. Hey @xet7 , thanks for the update, sorry for the late reply. As for now, I'd probably generate gcal/caldav URLs live, as long as this feature is in flux, triggered updates might just leave bits here and there with wrong data. As for point 3, this hits a bit the limits of my imagination, should you have a screenshot at hand, the picture surely would paint a 1000 words.. I think that on bounties above 250 USD, there's a default 3 month deadline. The list of supporters and the date they pledged is here https://www.bountysource.com/issues/41780513-add-feature-calendar-view/backers. Added a bounty on this issue. Please see https://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekan/issues .... @rautamiekka , to do that properly I'd probably need access to the enterprise edition source code, nontheless, I'll try my best guesswork:\nTerminology definition first: Each kanban card (in wekan, trello, odoo) consists of various dataobjects. I.e. trello's card will be defined completely by a \n\nmetadata object (card name, description, followers, asignees, duedates, tags, etc.)\n0 to N messages objects (each containing a message)\n0 to M checklists object (each containing all checklists)\n\nOdoo on top of that seems to be able define 0 to P activity / event objects, consisting of:\n\nactivity type\ndeadline (date)\nsummary (name)\nasignee(s)\ndescription\n\nThese activity objects show along with card deadlines on the asignee's calendar view (which wekan hopefully has soon too), both sending notifications (if set) upon incoming duedate.\nSince Odoo stores its data in postgresql, I assume that it has a generic \"event\" data type (table), each data object (row) then referenced i.e. in the card, or in the asignees calendar and pulled via a join query. \nWould this description suffice?. Added a bounty on this issue. Please see https://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekan/issues ...\nLet me know if I can provide details to further implementation of this.. Well it could be a design decision (facebook works the same way, or at least used to work last time i cared to check), nonetheless I believe that for wekan this might not be the best solution and wekan is simple enough to keep assets authenticated. A quick fix would be to allow only authenticated users to see files (unless you shared a board is public), a more optimal fix would be to lookup the board a file belongs to and lookup what users can access the board and deal with authorization accordingly.\nIf wekan ever allows to share data between boards or cards, using a data deduplication mechanism such a CAS storage with userfriendly filenames as hardlinks is an option that can be easily implemented when need be.. @xet7 , from what i can see the PR + usage of the meteor-file-collection changes the file storage model to a md5 addressed content-adressed storage. This i guess means that we have built-in data deduplication for free, making this a technically very sound solution from my perspective. How far along the way is the PR?\n. I checked back with vsivsi about the data-dedup, I was a bit overenthusiastic (built-in file-level dedup is not included in gridfs as I hoped it would) but luckily this is not on a major issue (and can be resolved by a write prior a read and some by wekan defined metadata). Please see the conversation in https://github.com/vsivsi/meteor-file-collection/issues/163 for details.. Well yep. But I guess wekan is tied to Mongo for as long as we find/write a DBAL for i.e. Mysql playing nicely with Meteor. Truth be said, Mongo improved since 2015, but I would feel way better about being able to manage files without it. Apart from FileCollection, there are projects like https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files that might be considered because of their backend scope... Wish I knew js better, to offer something closer to a more technically sound solution myself. Since I cant, I'll try to summarize, hopefully unbiased:\n\nCurrent GridFS implementation has tons of problems. Switching over to FileCollection would benefit Wekan a lot. People are already working on this so hopefully this will get into master soon. \nAdding basic deduplication + metadata ontop of FileColleection should be really easy (I can supply at least some basic pseudocode + a metadata schema)\nAlternative for non-mongo storage with Meteor exists (MeteorFiles), but since some code using FileCollection is already there, I'd stick to it. While Mongo may not be the best choice for storing blobs, FileCollection looks really nice.\nRidding Wekan on hard Mongo dependency would be great, could be relatively easy, but is still is way more work then using FileCollection.\n\nUsing FileCollection with added metadata + file-level deduplication + https://github.com/vsivsi/gridfs-locks looks like the most reasonable step ATM. Writing a small abstraction layer between Wekan code and FileCollection making FileCollection replacable if we ever support more databases then just Mogno should be helpful to switch implementations quicky.. This is really interesting. \n\nThe wiki entry didn't help\nSending was tested with a different client\nSPF records ok\nNo errors in mailserver log, just infos that wekan logged into the account, logged out.\nDidn't work 5 hours ago, now it works without any apparent reason.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm closing this bug and blaming it on random cosmic xrays hitting the server's hardware, my incompetency / blindness to the obvious, and threefingered dwarfs. The last ones mentioned are really the worst.\n. tried that (incl. reboot), didnt help. Might the problem be somewhere else? What code emits the login forbidden message? I couldnt find it. ok, now this is interesting:\nroot@wekan:~# snap version\nsnap    2.25\nsnapd   2.25\nseries  16\nubuntu  16.04\nkernel  4.4.0-83-generic\nroot@wekan:~# which snap\n/usr/bin/snap\nvs.\nroot@wekan:~# /snap/core/current/usr/bin/snap version\nsnap    2.24\nsnapd   2.25\nseries  16\nubuntu  16.04\nkernel  4.4.0-83-generic\nto tell the truth, wekan is the first snap package I use .. will look into keepasssxc now.. ok, so i tried:\nsudo systemctl enable apparmor.service # as adviced in keepassxc#581\napparmor_parser --replace --write-cache /etc/apparmor.d/usr.lib.snapd.snap-confine.real --cache-loc /etc/apparmor.d/cache # as adviced in snappy bud 1693037\nreboot\n... still having the same problem. I'm running wekan in a dedicated lxd container, tried to reboot the host machine too, checked if the apparmor service is enabled on host (it is).. Not really. I wrote the wekan ansible playbook for that https://github.com/Vaizard/mage-wekan/blob/master/tasks/main.yml, so basically it does this as root:\nsnap install wekan\nsnap refresh wekan\nsnap set wekan mail-url='{{ wekan_mail_url }}' # {{ var_name }} is the ansible way to echo a variable\nsnap set wekan mail-from='{{ wekan_mail_from }}'\nsnap set wekan root-url='{{ wekan_root_url }}'\nsnap set wekan port='{{ wekan_port }}'\nservice snap.wekan.wekan restart\nThis worked for 10 days and broke some time today without any apparent reason (yesterday I still worked with wekan myself, today no special maintainance, updates or anything were run) ... \n. i can try to snapshot the whole container and uninstall/reinstall wekan. \n```\nhost # lxc snapshot wekan\nhost # lxc exec wekan -- bash\nwekan # snap remove wekan\n2017-07-11T23:34:02+02:00 ERROR cannot remove snap file \"wekan\", will retry in 3 mins: [stop snap-wekan-8.mount] failed with exit status 1: Job for snap-wekan-8.mount failed.

Thanks, will try it when its there. I'd still like to get my original username back because there's all of the 10 days history, notifications etc. I'd have to reassign everything to the new user which is quite an oops. Should you have any idea on how to actually get to the reasons why things are failing, please let me know. Is there some verbose logging option I can switch on somehow?\n. so i got wekan back to behaving! rolled back to the second oldest backup and all is well now. huh. i'll need to check if there was a poweroutage or something that flew below my radar to at least figure out what went wrong. in the meantime, i'm for closing this bug and reopening it when i get something new to share\n. I concur, even though I'm not generally extremely happy with the state of Huginn and its dependency on Ruby. Though I do believe that a to make this really useful, a minimal subset of wekan rules for huginn should be maintained by the wekan dev community. This would provide a selected subset of interesting features wekan is currently missing out-of-the-box (thinking of an administrative option \"use huginn\" tha would require hugin to be a runtime dep) and at the same time a working example that people can hack to their needs and possibly even share back with everyone, building a specific ecosystem i really didnt see anywhere else. . Added a bounty on this issue. Please see https://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekan/issues . Flogo sounds really interesting - will look into it too.. @xet7 , what is your preferred implementation then? flogo / huggin / something else? just curious as I'll need something similar in an other project. Thanks. Hmm, is the UI part opensourced in flogo?. the getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND error means that \"mailserver.examples.com\" doesn't translate to a valid ip address. To resolve\n\ncheck the server name \nuse IP address instead of server name\nmake sure your host can lookup domain names correctly\n\nif the above didnt clear it up for you, try google getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND .... Hey @xet7, do you think that the new colours not being included is just this https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/a48630ffcfa5a5d96afad5960875da6e856ac079/models/boards.js#L103 piece of code missing the names? I searched the codebase for the 'yellow' string, except for the already changed files (and translations), this was the only place that seemed to explicitly name the colours. If this solves the issues you described, I'll patch that.. ",
    "andresmanelli": "@xet7 I managed to have a basic integration, I am adding some final details before uploading the repo to Github. Here's a preview.\n\nI am currently adding open/close and comment integration.\nMy idea / What is done\n\nFor the moment, columns default to To Do, In Progress, Review and Done\nEach column has a label relationship within a given repo, and these labels are synchronized.\nYou can activate the repo in priority mode or normal mode\nPriority: Is a board where all your priority-labeled issues are shown\nNormal: Is a board for the repo you activate, with name username/repoName\nCards are synchronized between the priority and normal boards (you can see that in the gif above)\nFor the moment my integration is a CLI NodeJS app that handles hooks from wekan/gogs, no webUI for the moment.\n\nIn a couple of days I will upload the very first working code.\nAny thoughts?. @xet7 I am not really familiar with Huginn, I will take a look at it. For the moment I'll finish my work in progress, it will not be certainly fancy but maybe it helps while a better integration is developed!. Hello, I started an implementation for this feature. It's still a work in progress, but here are some screenshots:\n\nHere, next to the Add button, you can select Import (from dropdowns) or Search (an entire board).\n\nIn the Import popup, you cad Import the selected board (next to the board name), or the selected card (at the bottom of the popup).\n\nIn the Search popup, you can click in the card to import and search with the text input (hitting enter).\nI am working in displaying the imported card details, and in providing a 'link' button to the imported board in the details view of the card that represents the board.\nWhat I find handful about the detailed view of a board, is that you could add checklists to that board (like partial implementations needed by root project).\nAny comments are welcome!. I think this will be covered in #2165 . Hello @scoubidoo, I didn't get much free time to continue this development but it is in my TODO list.\nWhat is missing: \n- Changing the name is not possible yet\n- Sort capability\n- Delete capability\n- ...\nFor the moment there basic functionality, I hope I have more time this week to continue.. Hello again,\n@naveengh I just pushed a couple of commits that adds name edition and archive capability. Tests are welcome!\n@xe7 Could you or someone check if including commiit https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/42bc905c16d1c01cbf24f773d2d5224ccdbeba78 everything works fine? It works for me, but some people had issues, maybe because of cherry picking.\nAnyway, I'll try to add the sort capabiliity in a couple of days.. Hello,\nI just wanted to say that I've my hands full and don't have any time these days to commit any changes. I try to add features and bug fixes as soon as I can. I see people are asking because things can be broken (#1492). Sorry about that, doing my best !. Hello @xet7 @naveengh , commit https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/37c94622e476f50bf2387bc8b140454d66200e78 adds reordering capability to swimlanes.\n@xet7 could you include this one and the one mentioned in #1487 ?. @xet7 commit https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/8d2839f0c3429a21b33bf8333cb2f20a275bc596 fix lists reorder in lists view. I don't remember any more where this was discussed.. Hello, I just added two commits:\n\nhttps://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/2f0309bc6bd6ba4b742591c0f2b9e280c32e1305 fixes (for me at least) #1458  and #1484\nhttps://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/ac7d44f8a8d809cd94ed5ef3640473f34c72403b fixes #1481 partially. The swimlane should be scrolled to the top in order to see properly the card details. But at least limits the details height to the board-canvas height so overall height doesn't get too big.\n\n@xet7 could you try those?. Actually, I think the first commit up there also fixes #1497 (alignment). Maybe #1497 should consider only what the OP said: \n\nI'd like to see the list titles only appear once at the top of the list and more distinct vertical lines dividing lists.. Maybe #1521 is related to these commits?. @johnleeming I tried your changes to *.styl files. I personally think 30% is a good compromise as 40% seems a little too dark. Can you try this? :\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/client/components/lists/list.styl b/client/components/lists/list.styl\nindex fa32ff6..746e59b 100644\n--- a/client/components/lists/list.styl\n+++ b/client/components/lists/list.styl\n@@ -9,8 +9,8 @@\n   // Even if this background color is the same as the body we can't leave it\n   // transparent, because that won't work during a list drag.\n   background: darken(white, 13%)\n-  border-left: 1px solid darken(white, 20%)\n-  border-bottom: 1px solid #CCC\n+  border-left: 1px solid darken(white, 30%)\n+  border-bottom: 1px solid darken(white, 30%)\n   padding: 0\n   float: left\ndiff --git a/client/components/swimlanes/swimlanes.styl b/client/components/swimlanes/swimlanes.styl\nindex 29054d3..78f2441 100644\n--- a/client/components/swimlanes/swimlanes.styl\n+++ b/client/components/swimlanes/swimlanes.styl\n@@ -29,7 +29,7 @@\n     flex-direction: row;\n     flex: 0 0 50px;\n     padding-bottom: 30px;\n-    border-bottom: 1px solid #CCC\n+    border-bottom: 1px solid darken(white, 30%)\n .swimlane-header\n   writing-mode: vertical-rl;\n\n```\nAnd about the header width, I didn't understand why to increase the width?

This should be fixed in https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/4861da52a031ca6ee05755df894caef9d062be42\n@Gobliins I forgot to add that endpoint in my latest commits, right now you can GET item, edit item, and DELETE item, but not create. Check models/checklistItems.js. I tried your command without the backslash, say:\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer 9u8wbopNDZJJaLqNPflPmzi7fBizPOYTJ1iwxkMg7xy\" -H \"Content-type:application/json\" -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/boards/fnnkpFjRPhdzMFkrJ/lists/ZSHvg4gEcKr7y424A/cards -d '{\"title\": \"test\", \"description\": \"hello world\", \"authorId\": \"yyJWGn2FZ2AwzHsxT\"}\nAnd I got:\nError: Unauthorized [...]\nSo I think it's a syntax problem. Maybe this helps.. @xet7 I'll take a look at it ! I think this is about creating a default swimlane on import.. @tiagosell can you provide the JSON data for me to test?. @tiagosell  your format is a wekan board I think. Anyway, I just pushed https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/5871a478e1280818f12fcb7250b7cbccf6907cf0 to my fork.\n@xet7  I think that commit should fix this.\n@EHJ-52n This is a capture of your imported board. Is it corrrect?\n\n. @tiagosell the problem for you is that the board was exported somwhere in between swimlanes addition and export bug fix (swimlanesId is present for cards, but no swimlanes key is present in JSON data. Could you try updating Wekan first and then export/import again?. @DissCent @johnleeming I'll try to take a look this week, I have the same behavior.. Hello everyone, I updated my fork. The two last commits solve the drag and detail view bugs for me.\n@xe7 could you take a look?\nEDIT: Not tested the detailed view in lists-only mode. I'm updating meteor right now. Update:\nNow details view is displayed in lists-only mode. Could someone give it a try?. @gramakri  I am getting myself errors of the kind There is no route [...]. Even when I load the main page.\nFor me, reloading a board gives errors, but going to the board from the home site works fine. This started happening after the Meteor update, I do not know if it is related.. @nebulade could you take a look at the last 3 commits of my fork? (See comments above). These bugs are fixed for me (maybe more tests are necessary) including the one fixed by your PR.\nI think your commit maybe breaks the drag in swimlane view.\nSorry if maybe I'm mistaken, I'll give it a look later.. Hello, please see commit ec0a8449ba98aea708e484d386e5a209e2be8fff, I think this should be fixed.. @xet7 @mayt2012 This should be fixed in v0.72. Hello, commit 9df3e3d26bffb2268cdcc7fa768eda60e4f0975c fixes this I think!. Hello, this is already fixex at my devel branch !. Yes, I noticed, I'm working on this. Thanks!. Hello, for what I can tell, after fixing some calls to cards.move(), the sort problem seems to be a Mongo/Meteor bug or something.\nI tried fetching some docs but the sort isn't right. I think I'll try to cherry pick my swimlane commits from v0.63 or so.. @ViViDboarder Great! I confirm #1465 fixes that problem. That also let my commit fcebb2a5373d6dea41b98b530c176cbee31bee4b fix move up/down.\n@xet7 Could you add these two to wekan next dev release? Thank you!. I'll try to take a look this week. . Maybe this bug is fixed with https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/4b53b0c90a57593c0fe2d808d2298e85f488bfa9 as it is related to #1520 . Could you test commit https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/a033c35a3411902b9bf8f62a40cd68f641e573d3 ?. @xet7 @Gobliins Commit https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/c4fa9010f34966b633c7bf7e46ad49fc101127c9 fixes this for me. Could you check?. @xet7 can you try https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/f470323ee746c4e79f07d166d511867408194eb6 (The swimlane is not created on a new board) and https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/bb37d8fa964c0d03721a664387e74300fde09eef (No matter what name you gave a swimlane, the feed on the right column didn't correctly retrieve the name of the swimlane being archived). This should be fixed in https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/c62a2ee11febf7f98456c97dc3973509b4bfe119. Forcing 100% height in list view.. @xet7 I can add this later today, I know where to put those lines. I introduced this bug with my commits :D. @xet7 See commit https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/58e5e9b308113e5a8af5166328a68a0aafcc2558, that should fix this.. Hello @xet7 @stahlstift, commit https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/4b53b0c90a57593c0fe2d808d2298e85f488bfa9 fixes this issue, as well as card copy between boards.\nI changed a little bit the UI in these popups (screenshot attached)\n\n. Sorry I didn't notice @GhassenRjab was working on this. Hello, I think this is related to #1538. I think the commit mentioned there should cover this issue too.. I think this issue was happening not because of import itself, but because of some code put in the wrong place that also broke drag & drop when leaving a board and reentering.\nCommit https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/5b0f7f8aef115b202aaff6bc25bb514426dc2009 should fix this. I think this should be fixed in commits added after v0.77.. @xet7 commit https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/454523dd4744b2bccb6805dad59abd664fdacb31 should fix this.. This is because the selected view is a field in the board's model. And I think, only the creator can modify the record. The thing is, if someone changes it, the change is made visible for everyone. I am not sure how the behavior should be.. @gotjoshua if it helps, see also Dockerfile at https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan-dev. See https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1547#issuecomment-374724015, this is the same issue.\nI already have plans to move the 'view' logic to the user profile model, don't know when though.. Created #1588 for this. Hello, Ok! I'll do this later today.. @xet7 Rebased and lint-free.\nPlease let me know what else may I modify.. Should the << icons on top of the card >> be visible when the cardDetails are closed? You don't explicitly say that. I'm not sure if they should be added to cardDetails or removed from minicard if cardDetails are closed.\nSee :\n\nThe linked boards are implemented yes:\n1. The dates (due, received, etc) were added to the board's model and are actually board values, not linked-board values.\n2. The checklists belong to the linked-board card, so they are not referenced by the board itself: If you link the same board in two other boards, each linked-board card will have its own checklists\n3. The members are actually added to the board, not the linked-board card.\n4. The description is the board's description, and can be edited within the linked-board card details\n5. Attachments belong also to that linked-board card only, so same as (2)\n6. Activity is the board's activity feed. Sorry for my absence, I will have time to start working on this in a couple of days maybe.\nMaybe I can add some more before merge. No promises about timing though.. Hello, I've been quite busy. I rebased my branch today. I tested (briefly) locally and it seems to work on top of devel branch.\nI will not have time right now to add the requirements noted by @xet7 , so I can propose:\n\nAdd the requirements later as improvements to this feature\nAsk someone from the community to continue my work and add the missing requirements\n\n@xet7 could you retest if this works for you?\n@vrms  thanks!. Welcome Board works for me when I register e new user (locally).\njust in case: In order the search to work, you must hit enter. Great to see this merged!. @brend you are totally right I think. When creating a user from the register form, the profile object is created but no boardView is added to that objet. The autoValue method is not called because the profile object exists.\nI think the code below should fix this (not tested):\n```diff\n--- a/models/users.js\n+++ b/models/users.js\n@@ -495,6 +495,7 @@ if (Meteor.isServer) {\n       throw new Meteor.Error('error-invitation-code-not-exist', 'The invitation code doesn\\'t exist');\n     } else {\n       user.profile = {icode: options.profile.invitationcode};\n+      user.profile.boardView = 'board-view-lists';\n     }\n return user;\n\n```. @ocdtrekkie I'm currently quite busy but I have plans to continue contributing to wekan in the next days/weeks.. I was kinda opening a PR when I saw #1837 \n@xet7  This was actually the cause for this feature to not work !. Hello, @BlackDuck888 thanks for the feedback.\nCould you describe \"some\" in \"some lists\"?\n. I see the board is in list view (correct me if I'm wrong). Do the cards are in Default swimlane?\nDo you have other swimlanes in board?. I will test in a couple of hours, but could you post  the exported board to see if there are any errors in the cards?\nIf you switch to swimlanes view do you still see the cards in the list?\nThanks!. I opened #1849 to fix this, it works locally for me. I hope it fixes this issue !. I think this is a nice idea!. Oh ok, I'll try to look at this later today. Thanks for the feedback!. Hello, I tried to reproduce this without success. Is there any other step you did in order to see the issue?. Now also fixes #1885 .

I'll share my concepts/progress as soon as I can. I'm just starting on this :D. @rterwedo Yes, I was actually planning to add templating as a general case, at least from a model point of view (Cards/Lists/Swimlanes/Boards).\n\nI'm working on my data model. Once I have a minimal mock-up I'll push to my fork so you can take a look :smile: . Hello, here is a gif showing the progress so far.\n\nShort wiki\n\nEvery user has a templates board\nThere are 3 fixed swimlanes:\nCard templates\nList templates\nBoard templates\nYou can add swimlane templates: Just add a swimlane in this board\nThe templates board (and all template-boards) are hidden from the main list\nTo access the templates, you can click on \"Templates\" on the main list header, or by going to the user's menu => Templates (as shown below)\n\n\n\nImportant\nAs swimlanes and lists are managed by their Id, if you try to add, for example, two template swimlanes, the lists would be duplicated. In order to solve this I added a title check: If there is a list with the same name as the template list to be added, we use this same list to put our cards into.\nTry it out\nI pushed my commits to my fork. Using the wekan-dev environment it should be fairly easy to try this out.\nWhat's missing\n\nMenus to create a board from a template\nTemplated users (Not really started, thinking about it)\nCreate templates from existing elements (should not be that hard to implement)\n\n@rterwedo @xet7 Let me know what you think !. @xet7 Pushed the rebased branch (I did not fix lint errors on wekanCreator.js and filter.js because I didn't modify these files.\nI didn't add migrations yet, so your boards are missing the type: 'board'\nCould you try it with a fresh database?. @xet7 Fixed the miniscreen render issues. @xet7 Pushed migrations. Hello @xet7, thanks for the feedback.\nI pushed the fix to my fork, and added board creation from templates.\nWhat do you think about copying labels if same color and text is found on the target board? It would be handy.\nTODO\n\n[x] Ask for new name before element creation\n[x] Copy attachments from templates\n[x] Copy labels from templates (if a matching label is found)\n[ ] Add fix for #1959 \n[ ] Create template from element\n[ ] @xet7 / @rterwedo ?. I forgot that ! Not for the moment, but should be quite straight forward. Added to the list of todos. @xet7 I'm not really sure, at least not before finishing the templating inside wekan. I'd have to take a look at the board export-import methods and find a way to have a consistent export-import behavior.. We must have added some common code yes, as my copy helpers in the models are meant for that.\n\nI'll change a little bit those functions to make them for generic and clean. I should probably talk to him and synchronize the two issues :). This should be fixed now in my edge branch. @xet7 could you or any user check if this is fixed with https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/97822f35fd6365e5631c5488e8ee595f76ab4e34 ?. Created https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2248. I think the original idea was to have user templates (create a new user with a set of default boards, etc)\nSharing templates would be great, but for the moment that is not covered.. @xet7 @gerroon Pushed fix to my edge branch. @xet7 This should be fixed in https://github.com/andresmanelli/wekan/commit/49229e1723de14cdc66dc6480624bba426d35e36. > \n\n@xet7 Looks like the swimlaneId is the issue. It is set to the same thing as the boardId. The id given for swimlaneId does exist in the Swimlanes collection and therefore the error on this line when it tries to find it: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/models/cards.js#L1301\nThe question is why did swimlaneId get set to the same as boardId?\n\nc.f. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/2238#issuecomment-470972136.

    "Sohalt": "I'd like to be able to create checklists by using the GFM syntax (see https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\nso when writing\n[ ] foo\n[x] bar\nI'd like it to turn into a checklist of two items (foo and bar), with foo not checked and bar checked\nusing markdown for creating checklists also solves the question addressed in #129 because you can easily use markdowns # for creating multiple headings for checklists and also multiple checklists by simply spacing the [ ] items with newlines\nhttps://github.com/FND/markdown-checklist might aid in implementing it.\n. I have looked a little into this and sadly it seems that checklists can't easily be implemented without a change happening upstream in marked, the library that wekan uses for markdown translation (well, more precisely wekan uses perak:markdown, but that is just a meteor wrapper around marked). There is a pending pull request for checklist support, but it has not been merged yet.\nAlternatively wekan could use a different library for markdown processing, such as showdown or markdown-it, which provide checklists.\nWith the markdown part covered there still needs to be logic for saving and restoring the state, but I think that should be manageable.\n. A GUI is in no way at odds with the markdown approach. I thought it would be easier to implement the markdown approach than adding additional GUI elements which is why I would prioritize it in order to quickly get checklists working at all, but I have nothing against implementing a GUI element in addition to the markdown.\n. I don't like the \"until something more functional come\" part. The markdown solution is very likely the fastest solution when having a dedicated keyboard since you are writing the card description anyways and a button means reaching for the mouse, positioning the cursor, clicking and repositioning the hands on the keyboard, which takes >2s. I am all for having a GUI for adding checkboxes so the casual user doesn't necessarily need to learn markdown, but this should never come at the expense of the power user since it is them who use the software extensively and use a feature hundreds of thousands times and every little bit of friction and every second lost add up. In this case especially I don't see any reason to remove the markdown solution once we've got a GUI for it, since the markdown in no way interferes with the GUI.\n. Not very convinced about speed. Reaching for the mouse is a major obstacle. I assumed the \"new item on enter\" functionality as a given when going for a GUI approach (it's what trello does). Combined with a keyboard shortcut for starting a checklist it might be faster than markdown, but less flexible. For example you can't quickly insert an already checked item or mixed lists, e.g.\n- foo\n- [x] bar\n- [ ] baz\n.\nAs for storage: the probably easiest solution would be to just store the markdown string, since you have to have that anyway when later editing the card. This might not be the most elegant solution but no extra model is required and the rendering is automatically being taken care of by the markdown library. The only issue is that the string needs to get updated when items get clicked\n. Also regarding not having to parse a \"markdown blob\" (whatever that exactly means): we still have to parse markdown since it is used as a way of structuring and styling card descriptions. When going for a dedicated storage model for checklists an additional complexity would be the need to store where in the description a checklist should be embedded (i.e. on which line).\n. Re: new item on enter: I got that (and am all for it). I just already assumed that would be the way to implement a dedicated checklist input since it appears to be the obvious way to do it (when opting for a GUI).\n. The problems in the markdown library could be avoided by either switching to a different library (I've named to examples above) or temporarily forking the currently used one and patching checklist support (the PR already exists) and using that until it lands upstream.\n. Not sure how advanced the markdown libraries are, but if the build an intermediary AST that could be extracted to avoid regex parsing or similar.\n. The proposal from the forum sounds tempting (I'm all for more simplicity and simply nesting cards in cards is about as simple/elegant as it gets), but I have major usability concerns. Allowing infinite recursion can quickly lead to an unmanageable mess with subtasks of subtasks of subtasks and so on. It also encourages overplanning/meta planning because you have to make decisions when to split something and what should be on what layer and for example at which granularity to assign due dates and people. The infinitely nested structure gets hard to visualize and it's easy to \"get lost\" somewhere in the hierarchy. The only reason I want checklists is because of the alternate UI. Checklist items are deliberately simple without any clutter, just a line of text with a checkbox in front, not a description, not a colored label, not a person assigned to it, not a due date on it. In my opinion checklists should not be for tracking long term progress, but clearly defined and quickly to carry out steps of a single conceptual activity (which is represented by the card). The obvious example would be a shopping list, where the card denotes the activity of going shopping and the list items are single things to purchase, which is  done in under a minute and doesn't need to be tracked on boards or assigned to people. Creating a new card for each item to purchase takes to long and clutters the board. A checklist on the other hand provides just the right amount of granularity in that it reminds you what to purchase and let's you track progress of that single coherent activity.\n. The labels already provide hints as to what to enter (the light gray text in the background) so I think it's predetermined what constitutes a valid date format. Doesn't it make sense to enforce that while typing?. ",

People should not have to write markup of any kind when a UI element can provide intuitive usability.\n. @mquandalle how may I help with this feature? Is there a planning document or design pattern that can be followed? Are there any sub-tasks towards creating a first-class checklist UI?\n. Here is one approach to how we could design the checklist component:\n- checklists could be stored in a Checklistscollection, \n- checklists would be associated with cards via 'foreign key': checklistId or cardId\n- collection helper(s) would be added to the Cards or Checklists collection to retrieve related documents\n- checklistItems would be an array of objects within each checklist document\n  - each checklist item object could have a completed boolean attribute\n  - It would be possible to add other attrubutes, such as assignedTo\n- checklist progress could be calculated by array.length comparison between completed: true and checklistItems.length\n- the component could be designed so that pressing \"return\" appends a new checklist item and places the cursor into the text area, so no mouse clicks would be necessary\n. The collection based approach may save some effort in several areas:\n- we would not have to parse a markdown 'blob' for checklist markup\n- we would not have to write any logic to map checklists to arrays. E.g. for comparing completed items with checklist length\n- we would not have to wait on an upstream change in the markdown library\n- we could avoid having to refactor checklists out of the markdown 'blob' if we decide that a component-based approach is desirable after 'markdown proof of concept'\nAs mentioned before, the componentized UI approach may even be more efficient than typing - [ ] for each checklist item.\n. One idea is that pressing the 'return' key would append a new checklist item, so that no mouse interaction would be required.\n. By 'markdown blob', I simply meant a string of markdown formatted text, which could be of varying size. Hence, the 'blobbiness'.\n. It also sounds like there are problems with the markdown library not supporting checklists, so rendering markdown-based checklists would be additional work.\nParsing and updating the markdown string, or blob, when checking a box also sounds non-trivial.\n. Cool, we sometimes need to state the obvious when planning to develop a feature.\n. @RobertasMurza thanks. I will read through that discussion.\nIn general, the component/collection approach could more naturally align with Meteor/JavaScript since the checklists would just be JSON documents. The markdown approach seems like it would take wrangling, such as regEx searches on the markdown string.\n. OK, cool. It still sounds similar though. In effect, we would be writing an intermediary layer to parse a data structure to/from a JavaScript object, when a collection/component approach would naturally store the data as JSON.\n. This sounds similar to the 'impedence mismatch' encountered in ORM libraries. In those edges between data models, a lot of complexity can accrue.\n. We are still waiting on feedback from @andersonlin in pull request #576 \nIt may be that @andersonlin does not have a Github account, so may not be able to sign the contributor agreement. Is there another way to move forward with that PR?\n. @mquandalle what can we do to get this feature,mand possibly PR #576, merged into Wekan?\n. @jelazos7 see pull request #630 for working checklist feature. Let us know what you think.\n. As an aside, one challenge that arises with label text is finding contrasting color. There could be a function that compares label color luminance with white and grey and then selects a font color to maximize contrast.\n. @andersonlin would you consider signing the contributors agreement? We would be interested to see you checklist code in Wekan core \ud83d\ude03\n. @andersonlin we are really excited about your work. When do you think it is ready for review and merge?\n. This PR would close #129, #298, and #597\n. No response yet. Two other options might be:\n- relax the contributor agreement requirement for Wekan\n- re-implement the feature\n. The contributor agreement explicitly allows Copyright permissions directly to Maxime Quandalle (@mquandalle) or any organization Maxime chooses. A simple Pull Request may not explicitly assign the Copyright privileges, e.g. if the PR code does not contain a license file.\nIt is not my decision to make, but is worth clarifying the purpose of the Wekan contributor agreement.\n. The PR #576 provides a working todo list feature. We are having difficulty tracking down the PR author, @andersonlin, so they can sign the Wekan contributor agreement. We are also awaiting feedback from @mquandalle regarding issues #129, #298, and this latest issue #597.\n. Another approach might be to loosen the requirement for contributors to sign a contributor's agreement. @mquandalle any thoughts on how we can move forward on PR #576?\n. @smarek that is a good idea. How would you document the agreement?\n. Ping @mquandalle. Any timeline for a PR review?\n. Please also participate in the 'Wekan community governance' discussion:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/640\nOur goal is to have more of the Wekan community members able to manage the Wekan organization, including reviewing/merging PRs such as this.\n. The Admin panel could also allow SMTP configuration.\n. Great work!\n. @mquandalle any timeline for PR review here?\n. Given the lack of response/follow-up from @mquandalle, it might be reasonable for the Wekan community to discuss a community-maintained fork. I will open an issue for discussion.\n. See issue #640 for a discussion of a new Wekan community governance structure.\n. @lkisme we ended up forking the project, primarily based on the lack of response to this pull request.\nPlease open the pull request against the Wefork/Wekan project repository, and mention that it closes issue #11.. >  it would be better if people could be satisfied with the governance of this original Wekan repository.\n@mquandalle what process should we follow to add people to the Wekan organization as managers?\nShould we have a brief election to add, for example, two more people as community maintainers of the Wekan organiation? \n. I would like to propose a process we could initially follow:\n1. members of the Wekan community nominate one or more persons other than themselves to be part of the 'Wekan governance team'\n2. we cast votes for the nominated people, e.g. using Github reactions (thumbs up only)\n3. the top two voted members will become part of the initial 'Wekan governance team'\nAlternatively, we might figure out an anonymous voting method, but I think the nominations should come from the community -- with no self-nomination.\n. I have opened a  community governance thread on the Wekan discussion platform.\n. I nominate @lkisme for membership to the 'Wekan maintainers' team.\nIf you agree with this nomination, please react to this comment with a 'thumbs up'.\n. I nominated @lkisme because they have an open pull request, showing current willingness to contribute.\n@pierreozoux perhaps you could nominate someone from the contributors list as well?\n. @koorg thanks for your input. I think we would need a shared organization for the community fork.\nDoes anyone have any proposals for a shared organization, or at least a name of a new organization, for the community fork?\n. > I wouldn\u2019t mind if there were a strong push for a community-governed fork, as the code could still go back and forth between the two \u201cbranches\u201d. However that would be a suboptimal model consuming both developers and confused users time, it would be better if people could be satisfied with the governance of this original Wekan repository.\n\n\n@mquandalle \n\n\n@ocdtrekkie I think @mquandalle meant it would be preferable to share governance of the Wekan organization/repository, as opposed to a community fork.\n@mquandalle do I understand you correctly? If so, would you be willing to grant administrative rights to the Wekan organization for one or more persons nominated to be community maintainers?\n. We need to get some pull requests opened and review in the Wekan community fork. Then, we can issue a release.\n. @fmonthel would you mind opening an issue in the Wefork/wekan repository?. Hi all. I opened a PR with a Meteor 1.4.x upgrade (#957). Please test and review.. I am interested to know why this proposal has been downvoted. What are some of the down-sides to allowing boards to have swimlanes?. Probably not. I.e. there is already a topbar with sign in link. I will prepare a screenshot shortly.. My apologies, I cannot duplicate on devel branch.. Thanks for the quick review.\nI just run meteor to start the app. What is the normal 'build' process?. @stephenmoloney, you can pin an NPM package to a specific version. Something like\nnpm install package@version --save\n. > can we upgrade the mongodb being used?\nYou can upgrade the running MongoDB instance. These instructions might be helpful.. This template name should be plural, just as the directory name. name=\"settings\"\n. Publication and subscription names should also be plural. E.g. settings.\n. It might be risky to reach this far into parent components.\n. The setting name strict is somewhat ambiguous. An explicit name might be invitationOnly or inviteOnly.\n. Mongo collection should match the variable name: invitation_codes (plural). See CardComments = new Mongo.Collection('card_comments'); for example.\n. Consider naming this to be more explicit. I.e. strict is ambiguous. More explicit names would be memberInviteOnly, invitationOnly, etc.\n. Consider renaming this to admin-users, for readability.\n. Alright, although we can create a function to check for additional features. Right now, all that is needed is a field for invite only, the other fields might or might not be added later.\n. ",

Perhaps the To address is wrong? Or the From address? I'm no mail expert either, but that \"Service unavailable\" tells me WeKan is able to send the mail to your SMTP server but there might be an error either in the mail or how the mail server is set up..

    "AdamBrodzinski": "@mquandalle Yep! I've migrated 3 apps so far. The easiest way is to start at the 'leafs' and work your way up the tree. The easiest way to render those is to use a blaze helper but you could also just use the onRendered callback to manually render a React node into a div.\nYou can pass the data that Meteor is getting into the props param of the rendered method and that will give the component the data it needs. Eventually you'll get to a point where React needs to fetch data (like components/activities) and the best way to do that is to make 2 components.. ActivitiesContainer which is only concerned about getting data and then Activities (normally) just gets props. This tends to separate concerns and makes it easier to debug.\nEventually you'll work your way back up the tree and then can attach the top nodes to a router (if wekan has one).\nI would recommend this video for refactoring: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF58ZJ1ZQxY\nCheers! :beers: \n. @mquandalle you could wrap the meteor mixin into a higher order component that has a similar API to Redux but uses the mixin to sideload for ease of use. This also creates a facade that would allow you to swap out the mixin if needed. I started tinkering with something like this but moved on to using just Redux once I ran out of time:\n``` javascript\nlet Post = function Post(props) {\n  return (\n    \n{props.title}\n{props.desc}\n\n  )\n}\nlet Posts = function Posts(props) {\n  return (\n    \n      { props.posts.map(doc => {\n         return \n      }) }\n    \n  )\n}\nPosts = fetchMeteorData(Posts, {\n  subscribeTo: 'allPosts',\n  fields: {posts: {desc: 1, title: 1}}, // passed into subscribe\n  mapToProps: () => {\n    let docs = db.posts.find({}, {sort: {title: -1}});\n    return {\n      posts: docs,\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n.

It does make more sense. Will see how to do it in this way.\n. @mquandalle I've refactored the PR based on RC4, now export selection.\n. No problem. I implemented the features to meet current needs from our project team, so in my fork, I cannot wait. But to main branch, I can re-write the PR when your plugin system is ready.\n. After studying how github notification works, I've implemented a notification feature in this PR: #454 \n. @mquandalle Thanks for confirmation. This feature was in my mind for weeks, I could not sleep well if it's not implemented. :-)\nCurrent implementation is some kind of compromise. In my mind, the perfect process was: inviter add the user to pre-members list, when invitee click \"accept\", then moved from pre-members to members. And, member should have the right to reject invitation, or quit from a board. But unfortunately, only admin have the privilege update board. Any idea to do it?\nYou may notice that, the board is added to invitee's list of invitedBoards. I can polish the code to show the message as you comment (and also a red dot on the avatar?), and also display the newly invited boards separately at bottom of invitee's \"all boards\" page, so invitee can decide to accept or reject.\n. The preMembers is not in current compromised code. \nI tried to extend the board with new property preMembers{ type: [String], optional: true }, but removed it when I found out that only admin can update board, invitee will failed to move self from preMembers to members. \nIs possible to allow non-admin user to: (1) move self from pre-members to members. (2) remove self from members?\n. @mquandalle the feature \"invite user via email, invited user can accept or decline\" is fully implemented, please review.\n. @mquandalle According to your line comments, I've split the commit into 2 commits by feature, and SimpleSchema.RegEx.Email is used. \nAs to red dot on avatar, I prefer it for its simplicity. it depends on how to understand the presence or availability. now I change css tag \"invited\" to \"pending\", is it now making more sense?\n. @mquandalle some defects are found, one of them is introduced by myself. here is the bugfix patch. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/426\nAnd, the newly translated zh-CN is still not pulled from Transifex. Any review process required?\n. The invited member isActive:true, he is same as other normal members, so that he can access the board. \nWe recognize the invited members by checking whether the board Id is in his invitedBoards list or not.\n. The added member name is missing, exactly as I saw when the bug triggered by a removed member with userId \"x\" (maybe legacy dirty data created by v0.10RC1)\n\n. Upgrading to RC2 won't trigger the issue any more, as every place now use activeMembers() instead of members, but the dirty data userId=\"x\" won't be cleaned. \nMay need clean the dirty data manually, or reuse the dirty data as recycle slot, by insert following code to addMember(memberId) here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/devel/models/boards.js#L204\njavascript\nconst xIndex = this.memberIndex('x');\nif (xIndex>=0) {\n  return {\n    $set: {\n      [`members.${xIndex}.userId`]: memberId,\n      [`members.${xIndex}.isActive`]: true,\n      [`members.${xIndex}.isAdmin`]: false,\n    },\n  };\n}\n. After upgrade to RC3, the buttons in board header bar works again. But the \"archives\" button on board list page headers still does not work.\n. I suppose the approach should apply to all small screen, even a PC browser window narrower than a fixed width, say, 420px.\n. It's quite smooth for the prototyping, and I even think it's good enough as a new feature. \n@mquandalle Please help to review. PR is created, #442. \nSome screenshots, FYI:\nBoard List & Board View:\n  ---  \nCard View, Sidebar:\n ---  \nPop-over, & Form:\n --- \n. @mquandalle Code optimized, please review again.\nThanks for the comments.

Screenshot:\n ---  --- \n. Yes, some discussion and alignment is definitely needed on the UI decisions. \nMaybe the consistency can be more on content, instead of exactly same UX. Anyway, the screen/pointer on PC and mobile device is different.\nThe quick access board navigate bar, changing to a left sidebar is okay. But I think current PC appearance is not wrong and good enough, just like Chrome bookmark bar, to navigate between boards/sites. On mobile web, it can minimize as a bookmark icon in bottom bar (at right of home icon), to trigger a popup list of starred bards.\nAnd, on mobile web, the round button to toggle sidebar on/off, will occupy the right side area of a very limited screen, and looks very strange on a mobile device. Maybe it's better to embed it as an icon in top bar. \nWhat do you think?\nAfter this PR is merged, I think the heavy work on the layout for mobile web should be almost done. \nTo get even better UX on mobile device, I agree it's time to turn to React and React Native.\n. @mquandalle Sorry for not replying in time. I read your thoughts, and I think it's good to abstract the cards with meta data. Actually, even when define labels, they can also be grouped into customized groups, like version/priority/module, etc.\nThe list in a Kanban board, to my understanding, usually means stage/progress, it's the core concept of Kanban methodology, value flow. It will be more flexible if you can define arbitrary dimension for a board, but, I will still ask the same question, is it over-engineering? Will it be enough to select any label group as vertical dimension? \nAnother question jump into my mind is, now I can watch a list for progress and notification, I am just wondering, how to implement if the list is a meta data?\nBTW, the animation gif showing swimming lane and dragging card to another user, it looks cool, but I am not very sure about its value in a real project, if several users all have multiple cards, the vertical space won't be enough. And, in this implementation, how to assign a card to multiple members?\nThe above questions are just my personal thinking, for your reference. If you do have good answers and decide to go forward, I will fully support you on it.\nAnd, yes, you are correct. I definitely agree that \"Sure the navigation need to be improved on mobile\". I also feel current steps to enter a board on mobile is not very ideal, it does feel more compatible to see cards with tabs, instead of seeing a list of lists. I will try improving this.\n. Yes, the build is faster than before.\nThe above screenshot is from iOS Chrome. The issue happens on both Chrome and Safari on iOS.\n. Yes, clean up the Ctrl-V handler, as only allow it working in preview popup.\n. results.file.type is usually \"image/png\", not a filename.\n. When there are multiple thumbnail, if click one then another very fast, will get a wrong width value. Adding a little delay will avoid the bug.\n. Shall I put the separated code under /lib? where to put the link to it please?\n. The paste can only be fired by keyboard Ctrl-V. Here we temporarily store the content in Popup.pasted, later we get from it then upload.\n. Good advice, I will try and verify. \nBTW, some ES6 rules seems not working in my Chrome, like string template, weird.\n. As number of members and labels may be different for cards, we need use max of them as columns, while set those with less members or labels with empty cells.\n. That code conversion is only for T9n, to set language for meteor account UI resources. Here is for the i18n resources inside WeKan so conversion is not needed.\n. Ok. Will update in next move, after everything is clear in discussion.\n. I am okay with your proposal, please go on.\n. BTW, with your proposal, will this section appear when user form in any state (sign-in, registration, pwd-forgot...)?\n. If put it into registration form, maybe it should also apply to enroll form when user set initial password ... \nI am not very sure whether it's needed or not, as the default language of user form is already user navigator language. \nI just thought of providing a way for user to change the language of the user form in any state, in case it's not preferred.\n. I now understand what you mean. \nA welcome board might be helpful to new user, maybe a simple start board with 4 lists (PLAN / TODO / DOING / DONE) is already enough. If too heavy or too many i18n sample data, maybe it will become a burden.\n. This function is not used at all, so I am going to remove it.\n. I removed the title intentionally for purpose of simplicity. As there is already a logo as the title, the text looks a little superfluous on the main page, especially on the header of small screen. \n. If no title, then it's miniprofile mode. When full screen, we cannot see the header and find the [x] button to close it, so we need a default title.\n. Ok, done as you suggest.\n. ",

    "nata-g": "@mquandalle  how about apollo stack update or is it too soon. I was recently reading  the  docs at http://docs.apollostack.com/ and going over the apollo client (for which you are the contributor) and was wondering  wekan might be suited for early testing of apollo + Mantra, now that there is little less confusion in the meteor world. My 2 cents.....\n. @mquandalle that would be awesome . Let us know the stack and high level design of Wekan rewrite. May be I can be active contributor this time....\n. BTW @mquandalle just curious to know if have you decided which approach you plan to use for rewrite - One-on-One mapping of the existing functionality or something that is being discussed here https://discuss.wekan.io/t/abtract-lists-into-a-generalized-task-meta-data/121 ?\n. @mquandalle  Sounds good. You know I was just reading the discourse topic again after a long break. Initially I was little opposed to the idea but now I am seeing the point. I can see the benefit of the new data model and how it can be useful. Now I am looking forward to playing with the app using the new data model \ud83d\ude04 \n. @mquandalle  In my journey learning about react, redux, apollo, I just came across this react based rich text editor framework - https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/. I immediately thought it would be a nice feature to integrate this in Wekan, particularly for any text based input.....\n. @mquandalle  ....As I was reading more about event sourcing and CQRS pattern, came across this resource about implementing Kanban using event sourcing. The sample app is using Java and spring framework though, but does have cool implementation architecture....\nhttps://github.com/eventuate-examples/es-kanban-board\n. @mquandalle ...Awesome!!! talking about Draft-js, maybe there might be some plugins to do real time editing in Draft-js in near future that can be used, similar to https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins\nAlso, I was wondering, since now there is lot of community interest and contributors willing to contribute, to publish the technologies and patterns that would be used in the Wekan rewrite. I mean lot of these tech is cutting edge (like Apollo) and there is lot of paradigm changes happening with React (components, inline styles on React elements etc) and there is going to be some learning curve involved for existing and future contributors, so may be writing up about the stack that is going to be used,  and its rationale and some high level architecture patterns  that are going to be followed,  would be immensely useful. It also helps the users about the changes that are going to be coming. My 2 cents.....\n. Maybe you can share it in the gitter channel, shown in the Readme.  @mquandalle is the main person to contact for these things\n. I don't think wekan uses imagemagick. \n. @mquandalle Any ETA when this feature would be merged? Seems to be one of the most requested feature :-)\n. @maulal these are pretty good numbers. BTW, what do you mean by 2Go Ram? Is it 2GB Ram. Are you using any cloud deployments or your in-house deployments?\nSo to get this numbers did you create indexes using the mongo shell on the production database without changing the indexes at the application level? \n.

    "d3dbit": "Nice feature.. +1  This would be a great feature.. Great feature.\n+1 to @TiibCD 's comment: \n\"For example Card A cannot move until all related cards aren't \"done\". Or just a feature to see a relation between cards parent/child would also be great like the \"Helloepics\" plugin\". Hello all,\nI think that the idea to vote and display the number of votes in the cards would be a nice feature.\nThanks for your effort.. I am also interested in this feature.. IMHO, calendar view is a needed feature to improve wekan app. Thanks for continuing developing it.. Hello all,\nI cannot delete boards from recycle bin. The delete boards button appears but it does not do anything.\n(Docker wekan-mongodb v1.11)\nThe same issue as: #1731 Cannot delete board from recycle bin. v1.11 and v1.18 --> I cannot delete boards from recycle bin. Hello all,\nWhat about this feature request (if-this-then-that)? Do you have some updates? \nHas anybody implemented the flogo option?\nI am very interested in this feature for automating some processes.\nThanks.. Me too. I am very interested in repeating cards.. Hello all,\nDo you have any update on this feature?\nHas someone tried flogo or huginn for automating tasks?\nhttps://www.flogo.io\nhttps://github.com/huginn/huginn\nThanks.\n. Nice idea. I need it too.. I think that it would be a great feature. In fact, I need it.. It could be a great improvement:\n\"trello has the little bell in the upper right corner: here all activities (concerning me, similar to \"tracking\" at Wekan) are listed permanently and across all boards. And if there is a notification under the bell that I haven't read yet, then the bell is highlighted.\"\n. I am also interested about: \n\"each new card to receive new unique number so this system can be used as internal tickets system or orders system. This number must be visible in collapsed view next to the name of the card too.\". Nice idea.. Great!. Hello,\nHave you been able to move forward with this topic?\nThanks for your work.. +1 to @edouardpa 's comment\nIt could be a nice idea to hide 'Attachements' section when it is empty\n. Hello all,\nI have the same issue with one board with a lot of cards and with around 5-10 users. It is slow with Chrome and Firefox. The issue is in the client side, not in the server side.\nWorkaround: if I filter by my own cards, then the performance becomes OK.. Nice idea.. Hello all,\nSorry, but I have just upgraded to v1.01 and I am continuing with the same issue.\n\n. Hello all,\nI have the same issue. If I try to open a shared link, the board appears blank. It occurs for both public and private boards, and for a standalone Wekan environment (docker - v1.02).\nThanks.. Hello all,\nWith the v1.3 I am experimenting the same issue. If I try to open a shared link, the board appears blank. It occurs for both public and private boards.\nThanks.. Hello all,\nI think that with the v1.11.0 I have solved the issue. \nNow I can open a board form a shared link (for example, when I receive an email with a link, if I press it I can access the board).\nThanks for your work.. @udvarit ,\nThanks for your PHP script. \nBut could you explain to us how to use it?\nCould you explain it in the wekan cleanup repo wiki? \n@xet7, thanks to upload the script to the wiki.. Yes. I use quay Docker image.\nAnd I use Firefox and Chrome, and I have the same issue in both browsers.\nHave you tried to simulate it with an Incognito mode browser?\nThanks!\n. Hello @xet7 ,\nSorry for the delay in reply you.\nI have just upgraded to the v1.01, and it seems that now it is working well.\nThanks for your support and thanks for your good work.. Hello @xet7 ,\nI have just upgraded to the v1.02 and again the issue has appeared.\nThanks.\n\n. I have upgraded to the v1.3 and I am experimenting the same issue. Thanks.. @xet7 sorry. After some tests, I think that I know how to reproduce my issue. I think that this issue only passes with the big boards. If I try to access a little board (a board with few cards) the issue does not appear. But if I try to access a big board (a board with a lot of cards and with 5-6 users) the issue appears.\nCould you try to reproduce and re-open my issue?\nSorry for my insistence.\nYou are doing an excellent work.\nThanks.. @xet7 ,\nFinally, this issue has been resolved after migrating all the cards of this issue board to a new one (as I said at the issue #1740).\nThanks.. It will be nice feature.. Ok thanks @xet7 . And sorry.. Hello @xet7 ,\n\"Your main problem is those cards at recycle bin. Getting those deleted would help a lot\"\nSorry. I don't understand. I thought that if I move some cards and/or lists to \"recycle bin\" I will improve the performance. In fact, I am doing that. Could you explain it?\nThanks.\nNote: if I try to filter by my cards, the performance improve a lot.. Hello @therampagerado ,\nWe (My team and I) are working only in one big board and we need to have access to the old cards (we cannot delete them).\nInstead of moving the old cards to the recycle bin if we try to move them to another board will we improve the performance of our Wekan environment? Or will the performance be the same as moving them to recycle bin?\nThanks.. @xet7 OK thanks. Then I will try it:\n\"...It's better to move old cards to another board...\" and \"...you can export board that has old cards to JSON file, move board to recycle bin, and delete board from recycle bin. If you sometime need old cards back, you can import JSON file...\". @xet7 ,\nGreat! I tried your advice: \"...It's better to move old cards to another board...\" and the wekan-app performance improved a lot. I recommend everyone to do it.\nThanks!. @DrGraypFroot \nVery good job!!! Thanks a lot for your work. \nBut one thing. If I am right, this script does not stop the wekan-app docker container before it does a mongodump. I think that it is better to stop the wekan-app before doing a mongodump. What do you think?\nThanks. It is a very nice python script.\n. Hello all,\nI have the same issue in a Docker environment.\nAfter reverting to v1.3 all becomes OK again.\nI do not recommend the upgrade to v1.4.\n. Nice idea!. @TNick , @xet7 ,\nHow can impact \"The implementation modifies the database\" to the Wekan app upgrade process? \nAnd how can impact it to a Wekan app restore from a JSON backup or mongo-dump backup (a backup from an older Wekan version)?\nThanks.\n. @TNick \nThanks for your work.. Hello @TNick ,\nI have been trying the new calendar and that's great!! Very good job!\nBut let me say to you:\n1. I see all the cards in the same (blue) color. Could it be possible to show the cards with the colors of the labels (if the cards have some labels)?\n2.  I think that it would be interesting to all the wekan community to see the card's details when the users click cards. But you said: \"A link to the card is inserted but does nothing because the code does not care detail switch to another view.\nAn easy next step is a typical use the card detail template to show card details the card's details user clicks a click\"\n3. Is it possible to move the calendar button next to filter or search button? I think that it is not useful to need to change between lists view to swimlanes view to calendar view. I think that it would be nice to get a direct access to the the calendar.\nThanks a lot for your work.. @TNick ,\n\nclicking on the card should show card details with current implementation in #1752\n\nGood job! \n\nHaving a separate button is not a problem if there's a consensus.\n\nBy now you have two OKs :-) (@lichtamberg and me hehe)\nThanks a lot.\n. The calendar feature is fantastic.  Great job!\n\n@lichtamberg said:\n\n\"I think we have a different workflow for using this calender - we never (or not often) have really end dates, only due dates.. The end dates are not so important for us, so we are not using this field.\"\n\nMee too. I did not use \"end dates\", only \"due dates\".\nFor me (and my team) if we have an activity scheduled it should have a \"due date\", but not an \"end date\" because the activity is not done. And when the activity is finished, then it will have an \"end date\".\nPerhaps, instead of using the \"end dates\" to drawing the cards in the calendar, would be better to use the \"due dates\". \nRemind that the \"due dates\" appears as yellow or red when the activity is nearing due date, but the \"end dates\" do not have reminders (do not appear as yellow or red), so I think that it could be the other reason to use \"due dates\" vs. \"end dates\".\nOn the other hand, for me, is a good decision to not use \"received date\" for drawing the cards in the calendar. It is OK to use the \"start date\".\n@lichtamberg said:\n\n\"making the durations visible in the calendar would mess up everything and it won't be usable for us. For us the approch would be better, to just mark the single days in the calendar - not the whole duration. This would make it also easier to distinguish the event types (received date, start date, due date, end date)\"\n\nOh no. I do not agree.\nI think that it is a good feature to mark the whole duration in the calendar (please, @TNick do not remove this feature).\nThe Wekan Calendar should be as close as possible to the (for example) Outlook Calendar. When you want to see all the day appointments you can see it sorted from their start time and you can see all the appointments duration. I think that it is good.\n\nLet me repeat: The calendar feature is so great. Thanks for implementing it.\n. @TNick , in fact, as we can see in this issue #1668 when we apply an \"end date\" the alarm (color yellow or red) of the \"due dates\" should disappear.\nA good new feature could be:\n1. Changing the \"end date\" for the \"due date\" for adding a card in the calendar view\n2. Changing the color on the card in the calendar view depending on the color of the \"due date\" on the card\n\n@lichtamberg said:\n\n\"Maybe it would be good to have a calendar setting per board, so you can select if you want to have shown the full timeframe or just the single days?\"\n\nGreat!!\n. @TNick :\n\n\"the user should be able to choose - for any particular board - the content of the cards, including which dates are shown and how, checkboxes, subtasks, description, and everything else.\"\n\nGreat. I agree with you.\nThanks.\n\n\"However, right now my efforts regarding wekan are directed toward converting the entire code base into using modules and imports/exports so that we can also have tests and we can use wekan as a package.\"\n\nNice job. But, IMHO is more important/urgent/necessary the calendar that the other. I think that the calendar is a necessary feature to compete against other kanban apps.. @TNick I have the same issue as @amahoneyLIT .\n\nOn the other hand, what about one of my first request?: \n\n\"Is it possible to move the calendar button next to filter or search button? I think that it is not useful to need to change between lists view to swimlanes view to the calendar view. I think that it would be nice to get a direct access to the calendar.\"\n\n\nThanks. Very good job.. @martin3785\nYou should add a start and a finish date (both) in the cards. Due dates do not add an appointment to the calendar.. Workaround: I have migrated all the cards from this issue board to another board, and now I can export the new board to a JSON file. I do not know why, but now my issue is resolved. I can close the issue.. Great idea!. Hi @xet7,\nJSON backup from: v1.11\nI have tried to restore it to: v1.18\nThanks.. Hello,\nI had the same issue after upgrade to v1.18 in a docker environment.\nWorkaround: I went to the \"change avatar\" section and I could select the correct avatar.. +1 Feature request. Hello, sorry I had a mistake. I thought that @yuppox wanted to say 'card colour', no 'board colour'. @xet7 sorry for my confusion.\nNote: Changing card's colour could be a nice feature.. It would be great!. Hello @GYKADSC , @xet7 ,\nI had a similar issue. \nI couldn't export one of my all boards. \nMy workaround: #1740 \n. I had the same issue after trying to activate HTTPS via Nginx. \nI tried it some weeks ago and I followed the Nginx's howto that we can find in the wekan's wiki. \nI thought that I had a mistake during the configuration and then I decided to disable it (now I am continuing access to wekan via HTTP).\nIf @hwcltjn has the same issue so I think that it is not my mistake.. @hwcltjn I am sorry, I can not try it now. I will let you know when I have tried it. Thanks.. ",

The problem may be that \nmany of these links use icons and lack aria-labels. I'll submit another \nPR that adds those to see if that fixes things.\nThanks.\n. I don't see lots of aria-labels. In particular:\n- I see an icon with class fa fa-angle-left with no label.\n- Likewise for the home icon in the top list\n- Also some icons classed \"fa fa-chevron-down\".\n- Same for \"fa fa-lock\".\nThat's after a couple minutes of looking. There are probably many more, \nbut I don't have the time to look for them, especially since I've \nalready fixed them all. Imagine all of that functionality presented to \nme as a screen reader user simply as \"link\", \"link link link link\". :) \nThat significantly diminishes Wekan's usability and is why I'm trying to \nget these PRs in. Automation is nice but it isn't working here.\n. I don't have a PR ready for the icon labels.\nI guess I'm a bit wary of putting more work into this because, to my \nmind, these are very basic fixes and it's a bit odd to be discussing \nthem for as long as we have been. Links without hrefs are broken markup, \nand it seems odd that you're automating fixing broken markup rather than \nputting in infrastructure to check for it to begin with, or encouraging \nthat people not use it. If I submitted some other type of broken HTML, I \nimagine I'd be asked to fix it. Similarly, your automation isn't adding \nthe aria-label to the <i/> tags containing the icon class. It seems \nfar more productive to put in place methodologies for designing \naccessibly and encourage those going forward, than to develop an \nautomated solution that will break when you transition to React anyway, \nthus undoing all accessibility fixes.\nI just don't have a lot more time to put into labeling icons and making \nelements keyboard-accessible.\n. The issue with that is it seems to require 2 distinct steps that require \nswitching between contexts. To use your system, I have to count the \ncards in the destination board, memorize the place, then input that into \na form. If I misremember the number or had it wrong to begin with, I \nhave to start the whole process over, including recounting. This seems \nsomewhat more complex than simple move up/down arrows that would let me \nexamine the change as I make it, directly in the relevant context.\nHaven't seen WordPress 4.4's DND implementation so can't comment on it.\n.

Is there any way to remove the urgent label before creating the card, or does the user have to create the card, break their workflow to open the card, then remove the label in the card's details?\nPerhaps capturing the labels and users like many applications use tags (once the user selects a tag, it renders it in a bubble along the bottom of the card with an x appended)?\n.

Adding an entry to appid-replacements.capnp, as we've done in your case, is currently the only other option.. bda1df5 does not seem to fix the issue for me on IE11.. To be more precise: after https://github.com/wefork/wekan/commit/6090ede8c98d98ba5d3664169cae4f2696ccd557, the comments immediately show up on the versions of Edge, Chrome, and Firefox that I've tested.

The main weird thing I notice when I follow the issue reproduction steps is that the Wekan sidebar starts in the minimized state, rather than in its usual expanded state.\nI consider this to be a (minor) Wekan <-> Sandstorm integration problem; when Sandstorm hides a Wekan iframe, that can apparently interfere with Wekan's rendering..

I suspect that what happened is that the user you were assigning to actually visited the grain. The problem happens when you try to assign to someone who hasn't visited the grain since last week's update.\n. I've published an SPK that includes the fix for this issue. You can manually install it from the app market at https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h or you can wait for the auto-update to pick it up in the next 24 hours.\n. The problem here is that Sandstorm does not yet have a way to notify the grain that the user has lost access. We have an open issue about that: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues/1863.

It's on the top-right corner of your sandstorm.io window: when you are not signed in sandstorm.io, it says \"Sign in\"; after you sign in, it changes to your name or id. When you click there, it drops down to \"Account settings\", \"logout\", and other options (and if you are an admin, \"Admin settings\").\n. @radomici You don't need Admin settings (I thought that, but I was wrong).\n1.- Just share your wekan with edit capabilities.\n2.- People need to sign in sandstorm.io to be able to edit (so wekan learn their names, for the cards), but they can remain as guests.\n3.- If they signed in with github or google, they can edit right now.\n4.- If they signed in with email token, they need to reload the page, and they can edit. <<< this is the bug that need to be fixed (force an automatic reload for users signing in with email token.

",
    "mitar": "\nThe difficult part is that I really rely on board members (people that can edit it) being present in the user collection.\n\nExactly this was my long rant yesterday on Sandstorm IRC channel. I really think that Sandstorm should just provide ephemeral uid for anonymous users, so that from the perspective of an app anonymous users look like normal users (they have name, uid, handle). So that apps can add them to the database and use them to reference them from other documents/tables. And reuse all the permission logic for normal users. The only difference is that once user closes their window, the uid is never reused again.\nThe app can then use normal/traditional cron job to delete inactive users (which those anonymous users would be) or handle them in any way app wants.\nIn this way app does not have to implement anything special. And Sandstorm handles all the life-cycle of the user. Even if user starts as an anonymous user and then decides to register, Sandstorm can remember the uid it provided for that anonymous user and link it to real user. So app again does not have to handle that in any special way. For app it is just that that uid changed name and handle. And that the app will see the uid in the future again.\nRequiring apps to specially handle anonymous users is really hard and require apps to special-case Sandstorm.\n. (Related: Sandstorm should also handle that usernames are unique per grain.)\n. X-Sandstorm-Tab-Id has bad usability. If somebody has grain opened in multiple browser windows/tabs they would not be the same user.\n\nHowever, not all apps want that effect, therefore we cannot just do this for everyone.\n\nCan you please give me an example of an app which has both permission system and ignores X-Sandstorm-User-Id? I can understand that there are apps which simply never use X-Sandstorm-User-Id because all their users are anonymous (to them it will not hurt if X-Sandstorm-User-Id becomes available). And there are apps which currently do not support anonymous users because they otherwise have permissions and it is simply too hard to make change to support also anonymous users in a user friendly and consistent way.\nSo show me an app which would break if we would start supplying X-Sandstorm-User-Id for all users, and not reuse it for anonymous users?\n. > That's working as intended. Anonymous users are anonymous.\nBut it works differently than what people expect from \"private browsing\" in browsers. I think that is a good user experience and it is something users are used to and understand. You are requiring from them to re-learn what means \"anonymous\" (private) in the browser. Re-learning is always tricky in the security settings.\nI think it is amazing to have a platform which can respect \"private browsing\" (and do-not-track) natively. But this current implementation is not that. It goes to some strange variation of the \"anonymous\" I would claim no user is really asking for. I would claim users want anonymity per browsing session, not per tab. Per tab anonymity is madness. Do you do any user studies for this design decisions?\n\n. Yes. This is what all apps with permissions will end up doing. Simply ignoring any permissions anonymous users might have. This is why this design of anonymous users fails. It tries to provide permissions for anonymous users but in practice apps will then simply not provide any permissions to those users (except read-only permissions).\n. @dwrensha, perfect examples. Let's see:\n- filedrop uses only permissions, not uid, so starting passing uids for all users would not break anything\n- ethercalc does not support Sandstorm permissions at all: https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc/issues/146 (and will probably have the same issues as I am describing here)\n- gitweb uses only permissions and not uid, so nothing would break if we started offering uid to all users\nSo, my statement still stands: there is no app which handles permissions which registered users, and handles permissions with anonymous users. Or you have apps where all users are anonymous, or you have apps where users can be registered, but then anonymous users of those apps do not have any permissions which require database changes (maybe just reading around).\n. Let me summarize discussion here, because I really wrote a lot:\n- the problem is how to provide write permissions for anonymous (not-registered) Sandstorm users for apps which require UID to associate changes in the database\n- Sandstorm does not provide an UID for their anonymous users\n- I am claiming that it should, and just discard the UID after the session and never reuse it, so that users cannot be tracked, but that for the app it should look like a normal user, and could reuse normal permissions logic and associate that UID with changes\n- @kentonv is saying that this is bad and we should instead using tabId to get unique ID for Sandstorm anonymous users\n- I am saying that using tabId is bad because each browser tab during same browsing session would have then a different user and this is not something users expect from \"private browsing\" as they are used currently from browsers, they should just get their UID forgotten by Sandstorm (Sandstorm is managing users anyway) after they close the session\n- I am pointing out that current design requires from apps to do carry heavy burden to support anonymous users with write permissions and that for that fact apps will choose simply to require them to register to be able to edit, which will diminish usefulness of Sandstorm anonymous users feature\nConclusion, if Sandstorm does not change anything:\n- wekan can simply require all users to be registered (anonymous users cannot use it)\n- wekan can use for database ID Sandstorm tabId, but then in different browser tabs there will be different users; so if the same person open given link twice in the same browser at the same time, wekan will see it as two different users\nIf Sandstorm changes and provide uid for all sessions:\n- wekan can reuse current logic and things will magically start working\n- Sandstorm will be able to seamlessly allow upgrading anonymous users' changes to registered user, after user starts editing and then decide to login/register anyway to keep access to changes; app will not have to do anything for that\n- wekan database will grow with users for anonymous UIDs, so some regular cleanup or old users should probably be done; but this is something any app has to consider anyway (what to do with inactive users) and for Sandstorm use case with small grains I do not think it is really a problem (how many anonymous session do we really expect per year for a particular grain, 1000? 10k? still not really too many entries in the database)\n. You are right. It is not in the master branch, so I didn't find the code. So it is here:\n- ethercalc, uses just permissions and it would not break if we providing uid for all users\nMy case still holds.\n. Hm, you might have to escape that username. Potentially they can include some regular expression characters? Or do you cleanup username/handle values somewhere? Probably we can trust Sandstorm to pass valid handles in?\nI think this is good.\nThere is still a race-condition though. You should probably wrap this into try-catch and check for E11000 duplicate key exception and go to next number if it is thrown.\n. > You are right the username isn\u2019t sanitized so this isn\u2019t mergable as is.\nIt seems it is OK, from Sandstorm documentation: It contains only lower-case ASCII letters, digits, and underscores, and it never starts with a digit. \nSo we can hope that Sandstorm sanitizes this and just go with it.\n\nCould you expend on the race condition, I\u2019m not sure I get it?\n\nYou are doing first queries, and then when you find an username which is not in the database, you make another query which sets the username. Now, between you finding an username and you setting the username there might be some other session somewhere else which just did the same for same username. So your username setting will fail because of unique index on one of those.\nThis is low probability (like all race conditions are), but it can happen.\nThere are two steps here:\n- you wrap it inside the try/catch and you catch an exception of duplicate key, and you just retry another number\n- because usernames are case-insensitive, there might be that two usernames which differ just in case were added at the same time and key would not match them; what you should then do is after update check if there is really just one username with case-insensitive regex in the database, if there is more than two, you revert your change and go for the next number\nIt is a bit complicated, this is handled by those Meteor username methods.\nThe question is if you really want to do it. I just pointed out that there is a race condition. Because they are rare you might not invest time into fixing it. But once you know how to see and fix them it is pretty straightforward to do it here and in the future. Is pretty common pattern.\n. ",

Well, I certainly did.\nThe option no-equal to this rule makes the rule prevent that and tells you to use Session.equals instead.\n. By telling ESLint-plugin-Meteor about the names of the collections, they will automatically be registered as globals.\nFurthermore using collection.find() etc will then be linted. And assigning something other than new Mongo.Collection() to a collection will error out, because most likely you are doing something wrong then; although there are valid cases like in this project.\n. Example of a valid case where something other than new Meteor.Collection() is assigned to a collection.\nSince ESLint-plugin-Meteor does not know about third-party packages it is fine to disable this rule for this line.\n. These helpers access Session which is only defined on the client. Therefor they should be defined on the client only. Using them on the server would throw an error because Session is not defined there.\n. Marking a package as private will suppress multiple warnings of npm. It will also make sure you never accidentally $ npm publish this repository as an npm package.\n. All dependencies are pinned down to their exact versions to ensure consistency across development environments and the CI.\n. Usually ESLint-plugin-Meteor warns when any part of the Core-API is overwritten. Since monkey-patching is used here, and we seem to know what we are doing, the rule is disabled for that specific line :-)\n. Explicitly disabling the strict-rule is part of babel-eslint.\n. Enabling no-undef, so ESLint warns when undefined variables are used. This works in conjunction with meteor/globals, which defines Meteor's global variables (like Meteor and Session) depending on the environment of the file (/client, /server, or no special folder).\nSo Session will be defined in a file in /client, but not in a file in /server. In the latter case no-undef will warn when accessing  Session.\n. There was a proposal to deprecate usage of Session. In case any application followed this proposal, using Session can be explicitly forbidden with this rule.\nThe rule is disabled by default, so this line is redundant. All other rules are set to error out.\n. > I think this doesn\u2019t work as intented because even if some tests fails the unix return code will be 0 instead of a greater number\nAs npm test is intended exactly for this, it should work. I just verified locally and it worked as it should (without the silent option). You can test by running npm run lint; echo $?.\n\neslint ./\n\nThis should no longer be used because it will use the globally installed version of ESLint. Use $ npm test or $ npm run lint instead to run the local version of ESLint which will be executed through npm. While $ npm run lint is defined in the package.json scripts-block as eslint ./ and looks like it uses the global version as well, this will actually resolve to use the local version of ESLint. That's how the scripts-block works. It can use the exported commands of it's dependencies and prefers them over global commands.\n\nI guess it would be great if we could integrate the Eslint linter (including the eslint-meteor extension) with the meteor build system, so one could simple meteor lint\n\nI have thought about that and it is definitely possible. I have taken it into account while developing eslint-plugin-meteor. But meteor lint is also very slow, because the app has to be built before getting any results. People can run $ npm run lint or $ npm test before sending PRs. This will be way faster, because it doesn't need to compile the whole app first. When the linter is integrated into the editor properly, it's so much better because you get errors immediately during development. Having a plugin for meteor lint is less convenient because the errors are in the console and not where you develop.\nStill, somebody could write a meteor build plugin which uses the linter and the ESLint-plugin-Meteor behind the scenes. It would mainly be great for beginners or big projects like yours. I think it's much work for not-that-much benefit. It may be better to educate people on how to use npm properly instead of building tools which obscure everything. :)\n. ",

In my case, I had existing cards which showed other information after the upgrade. The numbered list feature is a bit specific as it not only changes the look of the text, but also parts of the content.\nI don't have an idea how to solve it in a good way. Ignoring numbered lists in titles would be strange as you can have multiline card titles.. Yes, good point! Compared to markdown rendering here on GitHub it is a bug. Usually you can have ordered lists like this:\n1. item 1\n1. item 2\n1. item 3\nwhich renders to:\n\nitem 1\nitem 2\nitem 3\n\nBut \n3. item 1\n3. item 2\n3. item 3\nrenders to\n\nitem 1\nitem 2\nitem 3\n\nIn the card title markdown I only have 3. some title which should really render to 3., not 1...

However also clicking a link with href=\"#\" moves focus to the top of the page, which can also suck. If they are really links that don't go anywhere, one trick/hack is to use a target string that doesn't exist on the page (like #void) which holds focus on the link.\nIf you just need a clickable though that does stuff on a page, a button may be a better element. They let you script in onclicks (and key listeners for enter/space) and don't need an href to be focusable. That might make more sense than automating href=\"#\" to a bunch of links doing button duty. And CSS nowadays can totally unbuttonify buttons if that was a concern (used to be an issue with old IEs, but everyone works pretty well nowadays).\n. ",

Buttons are designed to do nothing unless you tell them to do something ;) In the code there is an anchor with the class js-open-inlined-form. From that name I guess it opens some sort of form. It performs an action on the current page; that is what buttons are for. Anchors\u2014or anchors with a href to be precise\u2014are used to link to pages or parts of pages (internal links for example).\nI would be very interested in the reasoning behind the use of anchors.\n\nAs for the icons, Font Awesome is inaccessible on its own; authors have to add bits of information to make them accessible. As it happens there is a project that is trying to figure out what those bits are: Font Awesome Accessibility Tests. We are very close to a definite solutions. The closest we've gotten is <span aria-label=\"love\" role=\"img\" class=\"fa fa-heart\">. There is still research to be done, but this is where we are now.\nTo avoid having to deal with inaccessible icon fonts altogether; I suggest the use of SVG icons. They offer the same benefits as icon fonts, plus you can tailor them to your needs\u2014I'm guessing Wekan includes all FA icons. For more information on inaccessible icon fonts I would like to my icon font resource list and the Death to Icon Fonts talk by @ninjanails in particular.\n. >  The problem is that we need to set some title/aria-label from every relevant element\nThe problem is that Wekan uses anchors where it should use button's.\nLet me put it like this: what happens if there is no title set on an anchor? Why is title set but not a href? Why does Wekan use anchors instead of button's?

    "GhassenRjab": "The export Wekan board feature already exists,\nWe just need to add the import feature.\nTo add this feature, I started with changing the \"Create Board\" pop-up\n\nI changed \"Import board from Trello\" to be \"Import board\" that will open a new pop-up itself\n\ncontaining these two options \"From Trello\" and \"From Wekan\"\nDo I continue with this approach? or there are other suggestions?. @davidlinc1 I am still working on it. Can other developers join and contribute to this PR? If yes, how?. I have encountered an issue when copying a card. My card has already a checklist created before adding sort feature, so there were no sort attribute in it. When copying the card I had an error saying sort is required. The solution would be to take into consideration old checklists that has no sort attribute and add the sort attribute on the fly, for example based on the checklist index.. @xet7 \nI'll check the first point.\nAs of the second, those messages will appear only one time when the migration occurs and they will be gone if you restart or stop/start Wekan.. The abbreviations are caused by incompatible language codes\nfor example \"br\" (Breton) is not supported by tap-i18n,\nand to add Norwegian language support we must specify if it is Bokm\u00e5l \"nb\" or Nynorsk \"nn\" and not only \"no\" (caused the abbreviation).\nMy question is these codes need to be changed in Transifex or directly in the code base?\nIf directly I'll take care of them.\nI'll be doing the alphabetic order in any way.. According to this link\nThe filename for Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l) must be nb.i18n.json\nand as you can see there is no \"br\" code, we need to add its support ourselves.\nI'll check how to add custom languages to tap-i18n. @xet7 I edited the link in my previous comment, I noticed it was not working.\nAs of the alphabetic order, I say we leave it as it is because it comes sorted by language codes by default.\nI tried sorting using the names and the English names of each language but I liked any.\nHere is the result of sorting using the English names :\n\nWe show their translated names but the names using to sort are Arabic, Basque, Catalan, etc..\nAnd here is the result of sorting using the translated names :\n\nAll names that are not written with Latin letters are stacked at the bottom.. Done, in PR #1070. @xet7 \nGood, now we need just to use the language codes that exists in the link in my previous comment to avoid having the abbreviations and this issue can be closed.. @xet7 \nFor Spanish (Spain) just use \"es\" code. @xet7 \nThat leaves us with only br abbreviation. I created this PR #1071 to address the issue.. Relate to the first option of the accepted answer\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/19052539/get-both-the-key-and-the-index-using-jade-iteration\nYou should create your own index. \"Change color\", \"Export board\" and \"Archive Board\" menu entries appear only for the admin of the board. I forgot to lint check the code. Ignore this PR.. When exporting a Wekan board, the attachment's URL is used to point to the file and import that file in another Wekan installation.\nSame thing happens with Trello.\nWe must take into consideration the import/export feature otherwise we risk losing exporting and importing attachments.. I'll start developing this feature and testing it right after #1117 gets merged. I created a PR #1134 to export and import Wekan attachments as base64 encoded files. Did the trick, Thx @nztqa . @Yachikh \nI'll review the code as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can join our community chat.vanila.io. @Yachikh \nCheck this commit, it adds a list footer and get the list of cards of current list, you can then proceed by computing the sum of due dates.\nSure you need to add css to make the output look good (I added any) and make sure to run npm run lint before submitting the PR. check this link for further information.. Forgot to run the linter. I pushed two commits fixing both errors. The translated texts and JSON format verification. I noticed the issue before but I thought it was the desirable behavior when importing boards.\nIt will be fixed soon. When importing boards, we used to create new activities about importing the board, lists, cards, etc...\nand ignore the original board's activities.\nWhat I am doing right now is import the original board's activities and create a new activity about importing the board. Unfortunately I encountered a problem causing attachments' related activities to be created twice. I reported the issue causing the problem to the library we are using to store attachments. Once I have the solution, I'll create the PR fixing this issue.. @sk33z3r @88fingerslukee \nIf you still have this issue, are you ok with sending me the json data exported from Trello? as it would help me debug the problem. Apparently there are some use cases we didn't take into consideration when importing from Trello.\nYour data will be used for debugging reasons only.. @sk33z3r \nOr send us the structure of the JSON file only, remove recursively any value that is not an object or an array.\nIf this is the JSON file\n{\n  \"key1\": \"value1\",\n  \"key2\": \"value2\",\n  \"key3\": {\n    \"key31\": [\n      {\n        \"key311\": \"value311\",\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n} \nsend as just the keys, like so\n{\n  \"key1\": \"\",\n  \"key2\": \"\",\n  \"key3\": {\n    \"key31\": [\n      {\n        \"key311\": \"\",\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\nDon't remove nested objects and arrays because we need the full structure.. @frmwrk123 \nAt the moment only checklists and comments are being copied to new card.\nWe see the cover in the newly copied card because it took the coverId (a card field) from original card and it references to the cover of the original one. If any changes happen to the attachment (cover) of the original card, it will affect the cover of the copied one.\nSo the solution would be to copy attachments of original card into the new card and edit the coverId with the new id of copied attachment (which is the cover in the original). I hope this gives you a heads up.\nAlso, I have a suggestion. When copying checklists, comments and attachments from original card, use direct method to circumvent before and after hooks of corresponding models. In other words use this Checklists.direct.insert(checklist) instead of this Checklists.insert(checklist). This way you will prevent creating new activities automatically and you will be able to copy old card activities too without the risk of duplicating data. So after copying the old activities, you may add a new activity at the end saying 'user copied cardName from oldList to newList'.\nThe scenario looks very similar to when importing Wekan boards, you may look at wekanCreator file in wekan/models/wekanCreator.js it will be of help.. This is odd because when exporting a Wekan board, members have userId field and not id. I forgot it. I'll hide it for Sandstorm. @thuanpq Thank you, but as the fix is just adding two lines of code (not a major one) and I already said there is an issue, I would've preferred to have a comment to help me fix, then I fix in the same PR. Not to have my PR closed.\nMaybe I am wrong in what I am saying, if yes, correct me.. @andresmanelli practically we've done the same thing. I just kept the lists clickable.\nMy PR will take time as I am still developing it. If your PR is ready, submit it, there is no problem. ",

Well, the proxy is on a different machine than the containers running Wekan. So, outside of using something like stunnel, I won't be able to use localhost in my config. =(. Appears I'm experiencing the same thing as #1596.. For my part, I can say I have not done any manual manipluation on my part of mongodb.\nFrom the behavior of clicking-on-a-card, it appears to be a websocket renegotiation thing? Like, the proxy doesn't appear to register any traffic if I go between boards and/or add a card, but as soon as I click. Bam, 200, 200, 101, etc.. \nMaybe this is expected behavior? Maybe I'm wildly off about how it functions, this is entirely possible as I am 0 knowledgeable about node.\nUS$0.02++. just verified, same issue with quay.io/wekan/wekan:friend image.\nverified also (again), that if I (change the ROOT_URL, restart the containers and) hit the backend server directly (a la http://internal.lan:81) that it works fine, and doesn't hesitate or renegotiate/reload at all when I open a card on a shared board. This isn't an acceptable workaround however. I need the reverse proxy functionality. . so we're just supposed to switch to caddy (which i've actually never heard of), and abandon our nginx investments, and this is just going to remain wontfix?\nIf so, please remember to update your documentation to reflect that nginx is no longer compatible with this software, and link to whatever caddy and snap are. There should probably be a separate issue opened for this documentation change as well. \nOtherwise, if someone finds an nginx fix, please post it. my nginx-fu nor my node-fu is strong enough to truly nail down where the defect is. \nUS$0.02++. The other issue I have with the idea that it's an nginx specific problem is that wekan works just fine behind an nginx proxy in all situations UNTIL a board is shared with a new user, and then it returns blank cards.\nWhat is different between the code in .80 and .8[12345] that would cause this behavior?. I deployed .80 (which has some functional issues I didn't have in later versions) as a test, and without changing any nginx config, cards can now be successfully loaded on shared boards. . confirmed, same change working for me too.\nEven though the container isn't using https, setting ROOT_URL to https anyway does seem to do the trick. It's even stopped the behavior that makes it appear to renegotiate whenever a card is clicked.\nthanks @m1d1, good find.. ",

An official Windows build is highly appreciated, wekan is really good for using as client kanban board and it's very fast.\nHere is a hackish way to run it then, i don't like it but it works :\nFOR %%A IN (.)

However we can't expect every user to spend several hours for just running the application. The problem is there is no windows binary build so everytime we have a new release i have to do the whole process again if the used fibres and bcrypt version changes.\nSo the next step as @xet7 mentioned is to add Windows to the build process and have a separate zip file for Windows.. The are also more robust solutions making meteor desktop app. arboleya:electrify looks like a good option. @chrisafl Yes i did, i tried many different kanaban boards util i decided to use Wekan, that's the reason i said if wekan supports desktop, it can be extremely useful for many people.\nPortable Kanban has good set of features but unlike wekan it is not user friendly and difficult to use specially for heavy users such as myself. It does not import from trello, and it is not open source (i could find any) nor cross platform, also it supports only one board!.\nI don't have any problem using Wekan on my desktop after i managed to set it up, the experience is great. I run it with single click and it's fast. But it is a very ugly and unmaintainable way of doing it and i will have problem with updates.. I just successfully installed wekan from source on win10 using the guide\nI have one minor problem, i run wekan via meteor command, but everytime i run it, it takes about 20 seconds, it seems that running it this way it tries to update the build or something like that, it doesn't run it right away. is there any other of way of running wekan after the installation ?.

    "guppie70": "Hi Maxime,\nThank you so much for your quick reaction!\nAm not sure what is actually making our situation unique/different from how others are using the Wekan software.\nYour suggestion for a clear message (\u201cDisconnected, will try to reconnect in 8 seconds\u201d) would be highly appreciated by my team members! Maybe the authentication token has an expiry date after which it\u2019s not valid anymore? And when the application attempts to use it after that date is passed, there is no possibility anymore to automatically restore the connection?\nWe have found that a simple \u201chard refresh\u201d (i.e. shift+reload) is sufficient to check if the user needs to login again.\nThe \u201cfunny\u201d thing is that the complete application seems to work even when the web socket connection is closed: dragging & dropping cards, creating new cards, etc. All is working normally. Hence the user has no clue that something is wrong and simply continues his work.\nIf you give me your email address I can explain in a bit more detail how we are using your application.\nRegards,\nJohan.\n\nOn 21 Dec 2015, at 15:45 , Maxime Quandalle notifications@github.com wrote:\nThat\u2019s strange, I never experienced such a problem.\nTechnically speaking we don\u2019t use Ajax requests to communicate between the client and the server, but instead we rely on a stateful websocket connection. If this connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect regularly using an authentication token kept in the browser local storage (so there is no need to login again). And by the way, this isn\u2019t a protocol I designed, this is all standard from the Meteor platform.\nOne thing we definitely need to solve is reporting disconnection in the UI, probably with a notification on top of the screen saying \u201cDisconnected, will try to reconnect in 8 seconds\u201d. That\u2019s should be pretty easy to implement, and would prevent users to lose changes.\nBut for the actual disconnection issue, I don\u2019t know what the problem is. It may be related to your deployment environment (for example, maybe websocket are not enabled, in which case the application fall back into HTTP long polling). Also, feel free to talk with me by email, I always like to know who is using Wekan in production :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/450#issuecomment-166320607.\n. \n",

However, it appears on the real deal - xcode iphone emulator or the real devices (iPhone 5s, 6, iPad air)\n. Anyone has a good clue on how to fix this?

    "neooleg": "\nSome places need tap twice to activate a \"click\", for example, the add label button on card detail view, and the a card need to be clicked twice to open the detail view\n\nLooks like this issue/thread can be moved to #953 (as well as #882 moved before by @xet7).. Hi @xet7, @mquandalle,\nPWA (Progressive Web Apps) should be faster way (in terms of development) to achieve offline support. Did you consider PWA?\nIt also correlates with a set of ideas found:\n- https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/480 -- React Native app is great, but some requirements from https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/480 can be covered with PWA, e.g. this offline support, faster loading the app, some integrations (push notifications) with OS.\nAnd more -- other PWA features which are lack by default in native app will be available, e.g. one click install out of the app store.\n- https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/299 -- even with this initiative migrating to React PWA should be considered to improve UX with faster loading and other mentioned things.\nHopefully, this opinion will be helpful.\nThanks,\nOleg. > I don't know is this good idea:\nTheme card does not need to be on the same board, it can be on separate board that Admin user also has access. But then, if only Admin has access to separate board that has Theme card, and users of board don't have access to board where Theme card is, how would we make it possible that users also have permission to see new theme on board?\nNot sure that I understood the idea. Is it means that I can apply different theme (sub-theme) per different board?. @xet7,\nthanks for sharing, looks good. Versioning is really important, nice to see it \ud83d\udc4d \nHowever, what confuses me is (possibly) mixing very different features:\n\nPlugin API which is extra logic and view\nThemes which is view (for existing UI always).\n\nAm I missing something?. Hi guys,\nI can define requirements (RFC) for the feature, if somebody will be able to take it in development?. OK, there is draft v 0.1 with some TODOs (TBA) for later work, but basic idea should be clear.\nGeneral\n\nFiltering should be very simple for user (i.e. without any queries, operators, operands, etc.) and extendable on implementation level. Let\u2019s call it Filtering Engine.\nAll existing features and all future plugin API should be covered with Filtering Engine, i.e. the filtering architecture should allow to implement filtering for any existing field and all added fields by plugins (see Technical Details below).\nThere are only two types of filtering for user:\nText filtering\nSelector (checkbox or radio button) filtering.\nClear filter button should be the last one on filter panel.\n\nText Filtering\n\nOn filter panel should be single text box which accepting any text\nTyped text should immediately show only cards which contains this text in any of the following fields:\nTitle\nDescription\nText within checklists\nComments\n\nSelector Filtering\nThe following fields should be represented as sections within a set of selectors inside:\n- Label (checkbox type)\n  - List of labels on the board\n- Due (radio button type)\n  - Due in the next day\n  - Due in the next week\n  - Due in the next month\n  - Has no due date\n- Last updated (radio button type)\n  - Updated a day ago\n  - Updated a week ago\n  - Updated a month ago\n  - Updated more than a month ago\n- Created at (radio button type)\n  - Created a day ago\n  - Created a week ago\n  - Created a month ago\n  - Created more than a month ago\n- Created by (checkbox type)\n  - List of members added to the board\n- Assigned to (checkbox type)\n  - List of members added to the board\nTechnical Details\nIdea\n\nThe general idea to have implementation which allow to compose filter logic with simple picking a field as operand and combining them with operators. It's logic of the filter.\nThe logic should be able to expose on UI. It's view of the filter.\n\nTBA\nWireframes\nTBA. @ebxm, this is a separate feature, so should be a separate issue IMO.. ## Abstract\n@rhelsing I have your hotfix (my revision is 823aea49), but the issue is still reproduces.\nDo you need more details to investigate?\nSTR\n\nTry to import Trello using manual https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Migrating-from-Trello\nMap user as Wekan asked\nGo next\n\nAR\nThere is span with \"400\" error inside.\nStack trace is the following:\n\nI20170402-17:07:38.220(3)?

Might be related/duplicate #882.\nThis is currently absolutely preventing to work with Wekan on mobile phones here (Android 7.1.1 with Chrome), because most time when we try to swipe/scoll we are moving the columns instead of scrolling - so the only thing it does is to break the arrangement of our wekan board. \nScrolling by swiping the grey area in the lower area doesn't do anything and can't be used to swipe/scroll.\nWe are using our wekan board without sandstorm. \n(thanks for this great software though \u2764\ufe0f !). I think there should be a small box, which automatically resizes to a bigger box when I drag and drop a file. Also I think the current workflow of not being able to drag and drop directly (but have to click add attachment) is not optimal, since at least in Firefox it just loads the dragged file (and quits wekan) in the tab - but doesnt upload it in Wekan.. \nI did a short screenscapture on how we do it in our own project with the JQuery File upload plugin (https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/), its also only 60 lines of JS-code (https://gist.github.com/lichtamberg/7dcbd62f74b697adf4d1094e6bd82e4d):\n\n. Where do you get this release numbers from? I installed Wekan via Snap too on Ubuntu and I have version 60?\nAlso when I search for wekan, I get version 60?\nshell\nsnap find wekan\nName         Version  Developer  Notes  Summary\nwekan-ondra  0.28     ondra      -      The open-source Trello-like kanban\nwekan        0.60     xet7       -      The open-source Trello-like kanban.

Just for completeness, we added our settings with folllowing and we dont have any problems:\nsudo snap set wekan mail-url=\"smtp://sender@example.com:pw12345@smtp.example.com:587\"\nsudo snap set wekan mailf-from=\"sender@example.com\"\nsudo snap set wekan root-url=\"https://example.com\"\nsudo snap set wekan port=\"8090\" # for nginx forwarding\n. Since 0.62 has been released some hours ago, I'm sure the snap will get updated accordingly soon.. I upgraded to 0.62 and all email settings still work. No problems.. Same here, the new font was a bit too thin & too high in relation imo... But I would love to have something in between - I mean a bit lighter font than the old one.. What about the Roboto Light? https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto. Valid point. Maybe we can add a font selector in the settings in the future.. But i think this is really low prio \ud83d\ude04 . 18px look like the same when I unset the line height in firefox debug mode (see my second screenshot). Will post a PR in some minutes.. Hm, I signed the agreement some minutes ago, but it still shows as not signed? \ud83e\udd14 . You are right, I moved the checkbox on the left side ~3px~ 0.2em down and removed the bottom item margin on the right side (which hasn't been changed in my previous commit btw) - hope we are talking about the same thing?\nLooks now like this: \n\nOriginal image for comparison: \n\n. I'm not sure if I can follow.. Could you please also post the error messages which you receive?. > Is it possible to move the calendar button next to filter or search button? I think that it is not useful to need to change between lists view to swimlanes view to calendar view. I think that it would be nice to get a direct access to the the calendar.\n+1\nAlso I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but the calendar doesn't work for me correctly. \nI set end dates for multiple cards (and also start date afterwards), but there is no single card displayed in the calendar view? The calendar is just empty.\nI tried it also with a completely new board - same effect - no card shows up in calendar.. @TNick I tried it with start date and end date, nothing works for me. I've exported my completely new testboard and posted the json here: https://pastebin.com/zkaVzjtU\n. About the dates, I would not show timeframes, but only single-day-entries for the corresponding received/start/finished/.. date - it leads to a complete UI mess if you have more than 5 cards running parallel imho.. Ahhh sorry... \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I did it three times wrong lol - it works now. \nI think we have a different workflow for using this calender - we never (or not often) have really end dates, only due dates.. The end dates are not so important for us, so we are not using this field.\nMost of the time we also don't have any duration, since we are only setting the due date - not other date field is filled out.\nAlso (if there is a start date, which is in about 2% of all cards) - the duration of our cards are also never intra-day, but from 2 days to 2 months long - we also don't use the hour selector to define the exact time.\nSo (beside what other people need :) ) we only need a week/month/year/list view - and because we have so many parallel cards, making the durations visible in the calendar would mess up everything and it won't be usable for us. For us the approch would be better, to just mark the single days in the calendar - not the whole duration. This would make it also easier to distinguish the event types (received date, start date, due date, end date)\nThank you very much for your great work \u2764\ufe0f . > Oh no. I do not agree.\n\nI think that it is a good feature to mark the whole duration in the calendar (please, @TNick do not remove this feature).\nThe Wekan Calendar should be as close as possible to the (for example) Outlook Calendar. When you want to see all the day appointments you can see it sorted from their start time and you can see all the appointments duration. I think that it is good.\n\nMaybe it would be good to have a calendar setting per board, so you can select if you want to have shown the full timeframe or just the single days?\nFor us it wouldn't work - we have about 50-60 cards parallel running, so having 50-60 lines for each single day would make it impossible to use the calendar.\nMaybe there is one more or less easy solution: if start and end/due date is set, show the whole duration - and if only the due/end date is set (and no start/received date), just show a single day entry on the corresponding date?. As far as I know this is a general problem in webbrowsers (a reported bug in Chrome f.e., see here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42401203/chrome-image-exif-orienation-issue).\nI had problems with this some weeks ago (in another project, not wekan) and there was actually no good solution for it, except to rotate the image on the server and strip the exif information.\nMost browsers don't process the exif information for embedded images - but if you open them alone in a new tab it works fine.\nThere is a new CSS 3 attribute \"image-orientation\", but it's not really implemented beside Firefox and iOS Safari - see here: https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-image-orientation\nI don't think there is a easy solution for this right now, processing the images server side via ImageMagick is probably a bit more complex to integrate in wekan imo..

    "willsALMANJ": "This issue was closed but Wekan does not work very well without a network connection in my opinion. From my testing, if you have Wekan open and have loaded a board, you will be able to continue manipulating and viewing that board once the connection is lost. However, if you restart the browser, all board data is lost until you regain a network connection and reload the board.\nWould it be possible to store the board data in a local cache for viewing without a network connection? It seems like this is one of the goals of Progressive Web Apps (using service workers mentioned in the opening post). The opening post mentioned going even further, adding support for offline editing. That seems like it might involve a lot more work to resolve conflicts between concurrent changes, but just keeping a read-only version of the data seems like it would not be as much work.\nMy motivation for asking about this is that I would like to run my own server, but maintaining 100% uptime will be difficult. If users could at least see a recent state of the board when the server goes down, that should be enough to get by until the server can be fixed.. ",

I was thinking about another feature that would come handy in such a complex scenario. I'd call it Board as a card (lacking a better name)\nWhat I mean is the possibility to pull an existing board into another board where it behaves like any other card just with an additional button or link to jump into that board very easily.\nThe idea comes from video editing software (Final Cut Pro, or Avid) where you have a timeline that consists of videoclips but can just be pulled into another timeline as a whole (where it is editable just like any other clip)\nlinke this you can manage several projects in a board, but very easily create a kanban showing an overview of all projects (which can be moved though stages of completion i.e).. I guess what @xet7 is trying to say may be ... \"feel free to do it if you want the functionality\". \nUnfortunately my coding chops are close to 0, but I remember when I brought the idea of \"board as card\" or \"nested boards\" (\"nesting\" is the term used in Video Editing where I borrowed the concept from) up for the first time (i think in a chat room for WeKan) quite a while ago @mquandalle mentioned this concept should not be too complicated to code, so ... \nnot 100% sure how to practically proceed with this. Maybe create a separate issue, put a bounty on it and see how many funds can be gathered for such?\nWhat do you think @JaromirDvoracek ?. I did one campaign for ERPNext on Bountysource once, so it seems to work. But I agree that (based on responsiveness) it looks like an abandoned project a bit.\nAnyway, it's the only one I know.. that's good to know but actually not required in order to utilize bountysource for wekan. \nIf I understand correctly anybody can put a bounty an a github issue and the anyone who delivers the code (which could as well be the original creator of course) will be able to claim the money. So you could receive direct support though that team, or just deliver solutions for any bounty posted (based on a github issue or not) and claim funds associated with a specific bounty (which often may refer to a github issue or certain functionality added to an application).. also quite useful (borrowed from Odoos kanban) ... the ability to minimize or fold columns (lists in wekan terminology) which adds horizontal real estate. @andresmanelli Super happy and grateful you took this thing on! I'm convinced it's a killer feature which nobody else to my knowledge has thus far. Sorry that apart from suggesting this (among other I believe) I can't help much because I can not code whatsoever..

May you can take a look in order to check this within the process of rc-version before releasing v0.11 final.\nThanks a lot. In case I should so an addtional or adjusted test, please let me know!\nThanks + Cheers,\nRobert\n. Yesterday, I installed and tested the wekan pre-release v0.11.0-rc2 - During this tests no exception was thrown and mails was sent successfully. Maybe my local git clone during rc1 was not fully updated before I build the application. I'll keep an eye on this during further rcX-testing over the next days.\n. Hi,\njust to add an information and question:\nDue reading throw this issue, I switched to node v0.10.41 here in my environment (https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v0.10.41/).\nMy wekan installation (0.10.1) is running fine so far. Any remarks, which should be taking in consideration while switching from v0.10.40 to v0.10.41, Maxime?\nJust for my clarification and understanding: Wekan currently needs node v0.10.x - It's not running with node v0.12.x or v4.2.x or v5.1.x - That's right? (Just to be prepared, once my infrastructure- or security-guys going to ask me on this ;-)\nMerci beaucoup!\nBest regards,\nRobert\n. Hi Capensis-Team, Hi Mykola.\nI recently created an issue #473, which seems to handle the same underlying issue.

Use labels from X set. \nI then realized that the board import PR (https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/446) includes labels as well so that probably covers it. But it still would be nice to be able to save sets of labels and then being able to import them to any board.\nThanks,. Hmm.. Maybe http://viewerjs.org/ ?. If its anything like Microsoft Planners take on a Kanban then he means that the cards in the done column are completely collapsed and only show when the Accordion expand button is clicked in the list / column. I used to use this PR: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/446 for something similar..

    "2martens": "For me it doesn't matter how it is done but not being able to copy cards is really bad. In my usage there are some activities that repeat itself so I have created cards with checklists for them. Now I want to be able to duplicate/copy/drag and duplicate/whatever them to use them multiple times and prevent annoying repeating steps.. I managed to reorder items in a checklist. That is relatively easy for itself but the hierarchy of the DOM makes it at first impossible. The reason is that the card details and with it the checklist are below the container for the lists. By preventing the mousedown event of the sortable elements lower in the hierarchy to bubble up to the sortable of the list level, the sorting itself works. A challenge however is the updating of the sort order in a stable, deterministic way.. @max-marschall Well, I suppose the issue here is that I haven't tested the conversion of existing (large) checklists. The reason for this behaviour is likely that the way in which items are added has been changed and there might be database inconsistencies when having checklists created by the old method that get new items with the new behaviour. The only easy solution I can offer is to create new checklists and then dragging the checklist items on the new checklist after a first item was added to the new checklist.\n@ocdtrekkie For the first point there would need to be more details to understand what exactly occurred. The second point is true. Something that certainly contributes to this behaviour is the fact that there is only one sortable for each card. For the sortable widget all items are in ONE sortable separated by each other by non-sortable elements. Therefore if you drag an item below the lowest existing item, it will be positioned as the lowest item but not on the new checklist.\nHonestly, I don't know how to change this behaviour with an easy solution. There is only one sortable to ensure that new checklists are picked up immediately and items created there can be dragged immediately without closing and reopening the card details.\n@xet7 As much as I appreciate fast merges, is a pull request not exactly there to test for such problems before merging it?. The problem here is that the visible part on the card are activities. Upon adding a comment such an activity with the currently logged in user and current time is created. In addition the userID inside a card comment is given by a function on insert. This function returns the current user ID on insert.\nTherefore a fix for the first problem requires a small overhaul of the card comments and how they are created. My intention was a workable solution that worked for it's main purpose: Copying cards.\nThe second issue is rather easy to solve.. ",

    "rautamiekka": "^ Better not forget MySQL (or rather its superior forks Percona and MariaDB, although MariaDB is becoming something else but a MySQL fork); there's a native JSON support since certain versions. When everything's already running on MySQL, something not supporting it automatically becomes a non-option.. I made little research: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20616188/460695 recommends https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql (the link in the post is different but doesn't error out, which has to mean the original was renamed) for complete support (looking at the source code it has a wide array of features, so I can see why it's recommended) in pure Node.js but doesn't have reactive SELECT, for which some place recommended https://github.com/numtel/meteor-mysql.\nSeems, with those you're most of the time using functions instead of writing MySQL yourself. However, should you have to and need help, I'm available. I'm not awesome at it (or SQLite 3, which is largely similar) but not trash either.. ^ Meant MySQL code that's known to be needed, and is known what it should do.. ^ Is that screenshot from a Command Prompt window (on Window$) or from an external (outside Command Prompt) SSH Client ? Command Prompt, unlike NIX shells and external SSH Clients implementing such behaviour, creates a whole new line, which breaks single-line links and similar. The 5DNZ on the following line makes me believe that's the case.. ^ You're right, it's not wrapped, so that's 1 thing ruled out.. ^\n\nPS. Why did I write this essay \ud83d\ude15\n\nThat's not encouraging as far as development is concerned.. A complete description of the feature as done in Odoo would be nice.. ^ So far it does. And I didn't mean to read the source code.\n(Damned Postgre ...). Random ID collision is still possible, and unless the JavaScript is intelligent enough (which might not be fast enough) to provide another ID, submission will fail with database complaining.. Although it seems the uploads use an impossible-to-guess randomized address, such security vulnerability/breach is unacceptable regardless.. @xet7 How/where is the mentioned data stored ?. Judging from https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS/blob/master/packages/filesystem/filesystem.server.js, the files are physically stored on the computer's file system, but given Wekan doesn't run on a Web Server such as Apache, blocking access has to be done by modifying Wekan's Server JS (I think).. I'd have it on both the top and the bottom instead of only either, in which case the time needs to be cached in a variable instead of calculated twice.. ^ That's all I got now. Without digging into Wekan's code I can't be of better use, but if you know how to assign a variable the result of a math formula that's your easiest part.. ^ Without seeing your code I'm unable to tell, and even then it's not guaranteed. Besides, publish it on GitHub instead.. ^\n\nis that on x32 system?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxmox_Virtual_Environment says, if the pve kernel means that, it's exclusively x64, and their downloads at http://download.proxmox.com/debian/dists/wheezy/pve-no-subscription/ has only x64.\nhttp://cephnotes.ksperis.com/blog/page/2 reinforces the possibility that OpenVZ prior to Proxmox VE dropping support for it, as mentioned on the Wikipedia article, shared kernels.. ^ @ocdtrekkie \n\nIf they were just removed from Wekan's list, Sandstorm would still permit them access and they'd be re-added when they visit again\n\nDoes it mean Wekan has no way to just refuse to add the user if Wekan used a hack like this until Sandstorm provides a proper API ?\n1) The user is deleted like normal from the board on Wekan's end\n2) Wekan adds that user's data to database\n3) When Sandstorm tries to re-add the user, Wekan checks the database for the user and on match doesn't re-add. Even if Sandstorm wouldn't realize it failed to re-add, it'd soon be obvious to the user they can't be re-added regardless of Sandstorm.. ",

Yes, I understood. I do not know transifex that good \u2013 isn't it possible to define different strings which consider the context like as in your example \"this-board\" + \"to-this-board\u201c? Years ago, I participated in a translation project and that was exactly what was possible there \u2026 But of course, this requires that we create a list of necessary strings for German-speakers (and so do the French and others who live in inflecting languages).

You understand right.\nConfig is not specifying TLS at all, connection goes to port 25 using\nsmtp://user:pass@emailserver:25/\nThe config in the admin panel is also saved without TLS checked.\nDisabling TLS on the SMTP server works.

Same problem with the protocol. When you're behind a TLS-Proxy you're loosing the connection, when you click on a card.

I use SSH and GeoTrust certificates. \nBut i'm sure the most users do use Plesk & Lets Encrypt.. Nope. Just read.. @REJack \nNo proxy around there.. @xet7 \nSure. Not in global or enterprise setups, but in infinity small and private groups like families, school classes, fraternities, walking club, dance groups, boycouts, churches, choral society, neighborhood, etc., etc.. Try to set the protocol of the URL_ROOT to https:// . Yes. I think you're right. This seems to be the same error. . This was disposable data from a testing account. I'm aware of the security and privacy perspective. \nI'm not sure if this is the same bug as #910. The difference:\n The self registration is ON.\n You're able to login after the registration, and create boards, tasks, etc. Regardless of that error.\nIn #910, you can't register and you can't do anything. . I had the same assumptions, the log pointed in that direction. My language settings was \"english\". . Yes. The mailserver is up and fine. I've testet that before.. This issue occurs before a user exits. So you can't disable it before in the admin panel. \nBut Yes, when the settings are made in the admin panel they are gone.\n. I know. I don't get the point of your post. . As far as i remember i belive the settings worked in the admin panel. You could send invitations etc.. Nope.

I wrote you: \n\nYou're able to login after the registration, and create boards, tasks, etc. Regardless of that error.\n\nThis issue is a bug report. - Not a support request. . I can publish my install notes tomorrow. . @xet7 \nIt's in the Wiki now. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-Wekan-on-Uberspace\nI've turned it into a script and created a gist so it's downloadable. . But when the register dialog hangs, it would be very useful to have a first user.. You're right. Thanks you.\nI would await that function in the board menu. But not in this \"right-side-slide-popup-log\".. It's a name. For example Thomas Anderson.. > Are you using wekan version greater that 0.13?\nYes. It's 0.16.\n\nUsually the from would be like Thomas Andersonthomas@anderson.com.\n\nYes.

That's #937.. There appear double slashes in the URL. I've reported that minutes ago. #962. @xet7 \nI didn't found help in the wiki for that. You don't know where to look for. It's (theoretically) easy, but the details. You don't know, if you should add a trailing slash to that path. Or better not. And do you have to filter the path component via webconfig? Or not. All combinations didn't really work. - So a little hint would useful. - It took a full day to find out: I doesn't work. And: It's not my fault.. Now i know. This... \nexport ROOT_URL='https://example.com/wekan' \n...was the missing info, i had to fiddle out by trial an error. But the double slash bug leaded me in the wrong direction. . I think a \"Configure Wekan\" page in the wiki would be good idea. That really explains, what's needed what possible and optional.\nSample:\nWekan with TLS/SSL\nTo run Wekan secured with TLS/SSL do the following steps:\n1. Setup a Web-Server/-Proxy with TLS/SSL support that maps requests to wekan. Link\n2. Set protocol to https. \nexport ROOT_URL='https://example.com/'\n3. Set Wekan to an internal port. \nexport PORT=54321\n4. Restart and run Wekan. \nWekan at subpath\nTo run Wekan to appear at a subpath of your domain:\n1. Setup a Web-Server/-Proxy that maps requests to wekan. Link\n2. Append subpath to domain, without trailing slash. \nexport ROOT_URL='http://example.com/mywekan'\n3. Set Wekan to an internal port. \nexport PORT=54321\n4. Restart and run Wekan. \nSMTP with TLS/SSL\nTo enable Wekan sending Mail from a mail server with TLS/SSL:\n1.

I'm new here, so i can't answer the most questions.. Opened to a new bug #974 . I think the latest version. Wekan v.0.17. - Is there a way to check that?\nI'll reinstall the latest release... Yes. It's still there. Not fixed.\n. I've setup another Wekan demo that points out the problem. There you can test it for yourself.\nThe ROOT_URL is https://wekan008.serpens.uberspace.de/wekan.\nVersion: wekan-0.17\nDemo-User: yeswekan\nDemo-Pass: yeswekan99\nThe Demo Board. \nSteps to reproduce:\n When you click on the cards or try to export board via board menu, you'll encounter the \"Page not found\". \n When you select and remove the second slash behind the \"wekan//\", then it works and you'll see the dialog.\n* Everything else seems to work as intended. \n@xet7 \nDon't panic. The access data is just for demo purposes. This is not a production machine. User and all data will be destroyed within 30 days. \n. @xet7 @Serubin \nIt's still a bug in the release process. Because I've used the latest release version:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases/download/v0.17/wekan-0.17.tar.gz\n. @xet7 \nI use the latest release version and just follow the step in the manual installation.

I've opened an issue under #973 \"Bug: Can't set language\".\nBut it was wrongly merged into this issue. .

I wish I was more of a developer to be able to understand some of this and give better investigative help, but I can at least follow the trail as best I can for now and give the info.\nThe text, \"Your JSON data does not include the proper information in the correct format\", is found in the error message defined as error-json-schema. My initial guess is that there is some incompatible card/list/label in our larger boards that doesn't play well with trelloCreator.js, assuming that truncation of the pasted data is not the cause (I don't have a way to prove or disprove this at the moment). Which leads me to look...\nin models/trelloCreator.js:\ncheck(board) {\n    try {\n      // check(data, {\n      //   membersMapping: Match.Optional(Object),\n      // });\n      this.checkActions(board.actions);\n      this.checkBoard(board);\n      this.checkLabels(board.labels);\n      this.checkLists(board.lists);\n      this.checkCards(board.cards);\n      this.checkChecklists(board.checklists);\n    } catch (e) {\n      throw new Meteor.Error('error-json-schema');\n    }\n  }\nand in models/watch.js:\n```\nMeteor.methods({\n  watch(watchableType, id, level) {\n    check(watchableType, String);\n    check(id, String);\n    check(level, Match.OneOf(String, null));\nconst userId = Meteor.userId();\n\nlet watchableObj = null;\nlet board = null;\nif (watchableType === 'board') {\n  watchableObj = Boards.findOne(id);\n  if (!watchableObj) throw new Meteor.Error('error-board-doesNotExist');\n  board = watchableObj;\n\n} else if (watchableType === 'list') {\n  watchableObj = Lists.findOne(id);\n  if (!watchableObj) throw new Meteor.Error('error-list-doesNotExist');\n  board = watchableObj.board();\n\n} else if (watchableType === 'card') {\n  watchableObj = Cards.findOne(id);\n  if (!watchableObj) throw new Meteor.Error('error-card-doesNotExist');\n  board = watchableObj.board();\n\n} else {\n  throw new Meteor.Error('error-json-schema');\n}\n\nif ((board.permission === 'private') && !board.hasMember(userId))\n  throw new Meteor.Error('error-board-notAMember');\n\nwatchableObj.setWatcher(userId, level);\nreturn true;\n\n},\n});\n```\nI did a fairly deep comparison between a smaller, working board that imports without issue and the larger boards that are failing. I didn't see any immediate issues in the way the JSON data was formatted or displayed, and there were no obvious differences in the scheme in general between the two boards.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Migrating-from-Trello#5-limitations\nAt this link, there is mention of comments on cards prior to December 2014 not being able to import. However, there is no data on my failing board that is older than 2016.\nI and my co-worker are willing to help track this down in any way we can. We desperately would like to use Wekan as a replacement to Trello. It's the closest, simplest, and most stable form of self-hosted kanban we've been able to find. Taiga, Restyaboard and Tuleap are simply way too much for our needs.\nEDIT4:\nI think I've just proven that data truncation is not the issue.\nCharacter count of a successfully imported board: 2887526\nCharacter count of a failed board import: 1358802\nDoing a little bit more comprehensive comparison between the trello exported JSON.. @xet7 \nOne failing board has all labels named, the other has a couple of unnamed. Both have ~18 lists and some cards have stickers. Are both of these known issues/limitations? Maybe I can strip out the sticker info from the JSON.\nI'll take a shot at re-creating a failing board and paste the JSON here if I can keeping these two things in mind.. - Note about one of the successful boards, it has all unnamed labels and no stickers.\n- Attempts to re-create a failing board have failed so far. I added stickers and a mix of named and unnamed labels, but still importing correctly.\n- I thought permissions may be an issue as I am not an owner of either of the failing boards. However, I copied the JSON from a successful board using a downgraded/non-owner account, and the board still imported successfully. Doesn't seem to matter if the user is an owner or not when exporting the JSON in Trello.\n- Could it have anything to do with a size limitation, in the amount of data coming over? Both of the failing boards do have quite a lot of attachments and images as covers compared to the boards that are importing properly. The receiving server has 55GB freespace available, and I doubt this board takes up that much. I feel like the import would begin successfully and fail later if this was the case, as well.. The Docker image tagged latest reports Wekan v0.36.0.\nI tried one of the boards again, but unfortunately the issue persists.. I really wish that I could. However, I am under an NDA. I know how incredibly difficult this makes it to troubleshoot.\nIf there's some type of filtering or search through the JSON that can be done, I'm more than willing to scrub the files myself and give stripped output. There's just way too much to strip out in the full file.\nI tried my hand again this morning to reproduce the issues on a dummy board, but I guess my software team is doing something abnormal that I'm missing. I checked for special characters in all possible entry fields, stickers/other powerups, empty labels, and user permissions. Any other feature from Trello I should check out that may not play nice with Wekan?. Are there any debug options that I could use to draw out more explicit\nerrors?\n. @safeershahul \nIf you're on a *nix install, do:\nsudo find / -name wekan-logo-header.png\nWhatever folder that is in is where all the logos are stored it seems.

Changed to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1742. Hi,\nTo ensure that it is an issue related to Wekan, please follow this procedure : \n\n\nPrepare /etc/hosts :\n127.0.0.1       yourmachine.yourdomain.fr\n\n\nCreate Meteor app from scratch :\n$ meteor create cas-app\n$ cd cas-app\n$ meteor add random accounts-ui atoy40:accounts-cas\n\n\nUpdate package.json :\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"ROOT_URL=\\\"http://yourmachine.yourdomain.fr:3000\\\" meteor run --settings cas.json\",\n````\n\n\nCreate cas.json :\n\n\n{\n    \"cas\": {\n        \"baseUrl\": <your conf here>\n        <other CAS settings>\n\nIn client/main.html :\n\nReplace \n{{> info}}\nwith\n{{> login}}\nand accordingly the template with :\n<template name=\"login\">\n  <button>Login</button>\n  {{> loginButtons}}\n</template>\n\nIn client/main.js :\n\nTemplate.login.events({\n  'click button'(event, instance) {\n    Meteor.loginWithCas(function() {\n      console.log(arguments);\n    });\n  },\n});\n\nLaunch :\nDon't start with meteor but with npm :\n$ npm start\n\nOpen your browser and try CAS. If it doesn't work, try to fix it, and next apply your conf inside Wekan.\nHope this helps !\n. This new CAS feature in Wekan is just a button that triggers an existing Meteor package called atoy40:accounts-cas that perform the CAS magic. In order to integrate it in Wekan, my first step was to make it working outside Wekan in a little standalone Meteor app. If it works in Meteor, it should work in Wekan. So the question is : did you try to make that little pure Meteor app as described above ? Please answer this question and we will see whether your issue is related to the Wekan integration or not. It takes a couple of minutes to try.. OK, I have experimented the same behaviour, and in fact the Meteor app just display the login name whereas Wekan write it in the log. In both cases, the CAS login works fine.\nBut I agree that the profiles should be created with the user details. This is due to atoy40:account-cas that depends on a somewhat outdated library :\nhttps://github.com/atoy40/meteor-accounts-cas/blob/master/package.js\nActually, cas: \"0.0.3\" doesn't support CAS attributes (name, mail, etc) but cas: \"0.0.5\" does !\nHere is the doc :\nhttps://github.com/joshchan/node-cas/wiki/CAS-Attributes\nTo fix this, you can : \n- either let your users fill their profile with their name and mail\n- or fork atoy40:account-cas and change the dependency (and adapt the code), then fork Wekan and use that fork ; or wait few days/weeks if I can take some times to fix it myself.\n. @pcurie \nHere are the links :\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/cas\nhttps://github.com/joshchan/node-cas\nhttps://github.com/joshchan/node-cas/wiki/CAS-Attributes\n. Hi,\n\nBy default, there are no console.log statement that will be traversed except if the debug option is set. Moreover, I won't remove console.log statements, because the plugin is a Meteor package, and Meteor don't require console.log statements to be removed : it is a Wekan-free plugin that can be used as-is in Wekan.\nCode quality has passed ; which fix should I apply ? (Moreover, it's an atmosphere plugin without package.json, how to pass the linter on it ?)\nBy default, CAS is disabled ; it will be enabled only if the conf file is present (the one used by the original plugin) ; I don't understand what I need to do with that Snap.\nAbout the edge branch, does it mean that you will set it back to the master branch after \"it will be fully tested\" (by who ?). Hi, \nI understand your point of view, unfortunately, all those environments make a little feature like this one hard to test and package. I hope it will work correctly like this. Also, please be aware that I'm not the author of the original CAS-login plugin, I just fork it in order to grab user attributes after authentication, and the original library was design with Meteor settings in mind, so it just work like this. \n\nBest regards, \nPhilippe \n\nDe: \"Lauri Ojansivu\" notifications@github.com\n\u00c0: \"wekan/wekan\" wekan@noreply.github.com\nCc: \"Philippe Poulard\" philippe.poulard@inria.fr, \"Mention\"\nmention@noreply.github.com\nEnvoy\u00e9: Lundi 24 Septembre 2018 18:23:54\nObjet: Re: [wekan/wekan] Add CAS with attributes (#1913)\n[ https://github.com/ppoulard | @ppoulard ]\nSo if debug option set, Meteor package will not output messages to console?\nWekan in not configured by .conf files.

I've tried the proposed fix and I can confirm what @valqk said: appending the slash to the _basePath in router.js makes it impossible to load boards (i.e. you can't acccess anything anymore).

It's an app. Commutity must be concentrated on functions and stability of the primary service. \nI beleve, we want make a lightweight, fast and cool service. Making a monster with integrated webserver, DB etc. functions will kill the idea.. @xet7, i tried to tell this. Wekan is a backend application. User can have multiple wekan instances and a load balancer proxying them. It's a classic practice.\nUsing only backend application in production is a very bad idea. I think, nobody really do that. No caching, no access log, no filters, no load balancers, no access control.\nThe best example for me is a Ghost Blogging Platform. It can be run standalone, but developpers assume that it is always behind Nginx/Apache/whatever.\nThe application itself does not provide SSL, virtual hosts etc.\nI think, that's the right way.\nI use Caddy to provide Wekan HTTPS access, and i have almost no problems.\n@NoodleBB doesn't have root access to server, that's his main problem.

I was looking for a Trello-like tool for bigger companies, where Trello isn't enough anymore (too many boards, you need to connect them automatically without manual work and basically you want to have overview over all boards in the company). I found https://www.favro.com as the answer.\nThis would be huge advantage for Wekan as it would outgrow Trello for more complicated setups. Before Favro, I recommended Asana for those cases. Is it a way Wekan would like to go \u2014\u00a0or the main goal is to create only OSS alternative to Trello?. Boards categorization is a good idea and nice feature!\nHowever, I was looking for a bit deeper hierarchy. Let's say I have some top-level one-year project for stakeholders and lower-level few-months projects for teams, so it could look somehow like this:\nNew eCommerce platform development board containing progress columns with following cards:\n- roll-out of new platform in Czechia card leading to own board containing cards like:\n  - implementation of local law requirements\n  - implementation of local payment gateway\n  - API implementation of local transport companies\n  - localization card leading to another board for copywriters\n     - web-copy for pages\n     - web-copy for categories\n     - web-copy for products\n     - ...\n- roll-out of new platform in Slovakia card leading to own board\n  - another tasks in sub-project...\n- roll-out of new platform in Hungary card leading to own board\n  - another tasks in sub-project...\nPoint is to have high-level overview board clickable through to the last outsourced card in some tiny team board.

Categories would be configurable/name able and you'd be able to easily create new categories and drag your boards into them.\n\n. @ckuhn203 This is the relevant issue comment that shows the issue in detail: wefork#49\nAny further discussion with the //b/ issues should be kept to wekan#785 for consistency.. My initial attempt was to update the remote flow_router repo to my own repo named serubin:flow_router. This however required me to update every subsequent repo that used any version of flow_router. I also ran into some odd dependency issues and decided it wasn't worth the effort.\nMy second attempt (which I've only just begun and am working on fixing up some meteor environment issues) is to add kadira:flow_router as a local package and let meteor use that over the remote versions. meteor hasn't been able to see my local package yet, but I'm still working to fix this.. Currently the most realistic thing to do seems to be adding my fork of flowrouter to a \"local package.\"\nThe flow router fix requires two packages, one of the main branch and another of the ssr branch. flowrouter separates the two for someone reason and requires both.\nSo far I've been unable to get meteor to see my local packages though. I've been dealing with some other stuff in life and haven't had time to investigate further into this issue.\n. The current issue with flow-router is this:\nI went through and added some logging to the FlowRouter.url() function and found this output:\njs\n  var completePath = this.path.apply(this, arguments);\n  // /wekan/b\n  var basePath = this._basePath || '/';\n  // /wekan\n  var pathWithoutBase = completePath.replace(new RegExp('^' + basePath), '');\n  // /b\n  return Meteor.absoluteUrl(pathWithoutBase);\n  // https://mydomain.net/wekan//b\nThe router should definitely be taking out the leading slash.\nChanging line 7 of lib/router.js of flowrouter to\njs\nvar pathWithoutBase = completePath.replace(new RegExp('^(\\/)|' + basePath), '');\nAn argument could be added for keeping that leading slash if necessary (ie. using a hashbang).\n. @Marabon That sounds about right. I made a mistake in my branch.\njavascript\nvar pathWithoutBase = completePath.replace(new RegExp('^' + basePath + '(\\/)'), '');\nFeel free to fix, I'm without my laptop (due to repairs) for the moment so I wont be able to get that working just yet.\nI have yet to get this properly merged into wekan, if you have any suggestions on how to make that happen I'd love to hear.. @Marabon Are you using my version of the router in wekan?\n@rubberduck203 The idea is to move it over to the wekan namespace once everything is working correctly again.. I'll edit my repo shortly. I'm going to see if I can replicate what you did on my end and get that fix working and merged shortly. @rubberduck203 @marcelofpfelix Unfortunately because wekan is asynchronous the rewrite rule won't work. The urls are interpreted on the client and not the server so it will never get passed through apache or nginx to allow for a rewrite to work.. @Marabon Could you help me out and provide a step by step of how you added my fix to the project? I'm struggling to meteor to recognize my local package. . @Marabon Perfect. Thank you. The fix for this is adding a source app.env in the dockerfile\nI'll create a pr for the fix. Someone will have to give it a test for me though.. Eslint was erroring on flow-router. I've changed the test command to ignore the packages/ directory to avoid this issue.. This should be a fix for the issue mentioned in #928 . @stephenmoloney Can you please offer a suggestion on an alternative way to add an environment variable?. I see what's going on now. Have we looked into options like this? https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9863 . Understood.. @NoodleBB I took a look at the demo site you provided. It appears as the javascript is an older version.

I spent most of the day trying to come up with an Nginx rewrite that would fix it and failed so far. \nI'm unfamiliar with meteor and flow router, but I'm wondering if it's possible to get off of the call to absoluteUri() and use a relative path in the view instead. . That's fantastic news!\nI've got to mention it though... it's not great to rely on a fork like this. I did try to get attention of the FlowRouter folks, but it does seem to be unmaintained at this point. Are there other options to replace it?  I'm happy to open a new issue if y'all feel it's more appropriate. . @marcelofpfelix is there any chance you can share your rewrite rule? I spent a day trying to create one that worked. . I would consider Alpine as an alternative. Ubuntu Core doesn't seem to have an official image (yet?). If you're really looking to minimize the container's disk footprint, Alpine weighs in at 5MB. \nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.brianchristner.io/docker-image-base-os-size-comparison/amp/.

It's the kind of behavior that means I can't recommend this fantastic project to my clients as an ultra low cost option. Reproducible deployments matter. I apologize if I panicked, but I have plans to migrate to a new server and this, well, panicked me. =)\nAnyway, the mirror is up for anyone who wants to pin to 0.16. . And I didn't mean to be unfriendly. \nThe panic is because without the tags, it is impossible to pin to a known stable version. I simply can't afford to risk automatically upgrading (without a way to go back) just because I bounced a container. . @xet I ran docker images to get the sha for v0.16 then ran the tag command above. Then I pulled latest and tagged it. \nI looked at the latest CI log, but didn't see anything related to docker. Can you share what you're seeing?. This appears to be back.\nIt works in v0.24, but not in v0.25-v0.29. . FWIW I was testing the docker builds from wekanteam/wekan.. If I'm catching the drift, the cache isn't being invalidated.

Sure, but that is not really solving the issue, it is just naming it short (docs) that it does not look ugly.

I am in no position to be able to pay for a bounty to get this done however I am ok with donating to the pool.. Btw I cant even open these json files in Vim or Emcs, since they are huge :( I do not know I think we need a better way to import large files with embeds.. @xet7 \nThank you for the detailed reply. \nThose work arounds are nice but I am personally not always on Linux, so it is though. Also this process crawls my laptop too :( These things can get many megabytes.\nIn any case I do wish to see a file import. Until then I will try your work arounds when I can.. Hi\nWell any text :) Any way to get the content out of Wekan is fine to me, except .json since it is no use and I cant find a way to make sense of it.\nFor instance I create many cards as my ideas flow and new lanes etc. Then I would like to just take those lanes as separate blocks of text and the cards as indented text under neat so\n|LANE A| |LANE B|\n|idea 1| |idea 20|\n|idea 2| |idea 21|\n|idea 3| |idea 22|\nbecomes\n```\nLANE A\n    idea 1\n    idea 2\n    idea 3\nLANE B\n    idea 20\n    idea 21\n    idea 22\n```. Well my use case is to see how long/tall a particular lane is compared to the others. Because it is impossible to know how far it goes down by looking at the scroll bar, given that scroll bar visible only when the mouse is over it anyways.\nImagine having couple todo lanes and some are longer than the others, and you just want to compare them.\nAlso havign a big picture helps with moving things around, it is much easier to shift cards  between lanes and balance things out.. I am not trying to export anything, I am just trying to get the big picture. But I see your point, maybe you thought that I was trying to get a screenshot or something, which is not a bad idea in general.. Thanks, that is a nice tip and I will try it, but that is not what  I am trying to solve here. I just do not understand why some lanes have constant \"loading\" animations at the bottom, even though no more cards to load. . Ok, so there are zoom bugs? I was not awarre of them I think.. See the screenshot. I am on Linux atm, and i do not know any good, gif app. I also do not want to reveal personal information. I think the screenshot below should demonstrarte the issue hopefully. I blurred the text areas.\nIt is not always on the same lane, but it is almost at the bottom of the tallest ones as far as I can tell.\nThat animation in the screenshot does not go away, keeps playing unless (It is still there after 5 mins)\n\nI zoom in and scroll down\nor I add an temp card at the bottom and delete it\n\n\n. @nickian\nI agree, it is super distracting  :( I actually glad that this is a confirmed bug now..

I'm trying to downgrade npm-mongo to an older version but I can't that is specified in the .meteor/versions file. Seems it forces the upgrade and gives some reason.\n@xet7 \nDue to using an old version of mongodb, we cannot upgrade mongo version?\nOr can we upgrade the mongodb being used?. @brylie I think some issues arose that were more than meets the eye, @xet7 knows more about.\nThis is why mongodb is fixed in the dockerfile.. I may have fixed the dockerbuild -- need to check a few things first\nI think you can merge this pull request. I'll make another one later.. As previously discussed, you cannot run the command source like that inside a dockerfile.\nThis will not work.\nhttps://travis-ci.org/wekan/wekan#L4565\n. @Serubin \nI did in this post\nI even tried those changes for the ENV\nIt doesn't work. \nI would focus on https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/957 for now to get the Dockerfile up and running.. The closest issue is documented here\nWe need to upgrade meteor, various dependencies and node js.\nThat is ongoing now at #957 . sorry - meant to send this to meteor1.4 branch. You should probably avoid rm -rf on the /var/lib/docker directory.\nIf there is something specific needed to be cleaned up, then seeking a docker command \nto do it might be a better way to go.\nA heavy handed approach to cleanup using a docker command would be \nsudo docker system prune \n. Please state versions being used -- this looks like an old build?\nie. Please document steps taken. I don't know how to fix this issue.\nsame issue on the alpine image at wekan-launchpad?. @thypon If you get a chance, does this fix this issue?. This is potentially a bug with the most recent update to meteor 1.4.\nIt might require a change to the Dockerfile. I have an idea what it might be but\nI would need to take a look... would be next week.\n@n00b42 \nCan you produce this running it on your local machine at localhost?\nBut first can I just double check a few simple things:\n\n\nWhy is #- MAIL_URL uncommented in your docker-compose.yml file?\n\n\nCan you change your @ symbol inside the email to %40 in MAIL url?\n\n\nEdit:\nIgnore suggestions 1 and 2 above, I see you are using the admin panel instead.\n. It's a problem with cfs-gridfs being deprecated.\nSeems quite similar to this issue\nhttps://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/7477\nAlso relevant\n- https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/7477#issuecomment-235968076\n- https://github.com/CollectionFS/DEPRECATING-cfs-gridfs\nI wonder is there some alternative to that package cfs-gridfs?\nThat said, I couldn't reproduce this issue when I tried it with my email account.. wrong branch. @huneau \nI think you have run into this issue. https://github.com/Medium/phantomjs/issues/467. This is a dependency/dependency versions issue.\n. @huneau \nCan you merge the latest version of wekan/meteor-1.4 and push back into this pull request with any conflicts resolved (if there are any)?\nI want to try build this PR myself.. Please document the steps taken to build/run wekan including any versions, etc.. have you tried the installing from source guide?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Install-and-Update#install-manually-from-source. Updating to gcc-4.9 on the travis host is actually optional I think as the output from the travis build says that it is already newest version - so that can be removed in next PR from travis.yml. It is required in the docker container though. I'll make a PR for it now - might is well get it over with.. @xet7 \nYea, sometimes those servers fail ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net but ha is meant to be the most reliable.\nMost of the time the build succeeds a few minutes or hours later.\nThe only alternative that comes to mind is to have a try some other server if this one fails like approach in the Dockerfile.\n.

    "Madko": "Same here, how to get the fix ?. @xet7 it's a manual install on CentOS 7.\n@AlexKornitzer will try to find out more about meteor. Thanks, it works with meteor (was a bit \"fun\" to install with their curl | sh). @xet7 I'm not using docker but I will check if I have a ROOT_URL somewhere. I'm also not sure about the --drop. Thanks for your help. I will keep you in touch.. @xet7 great this is working !\nIn order to correctly migrate the database schema wekan must be stopped first. Then data can be restored. At startup wekan will migrate the data.\nThanks you for your help. @xet7 thanks !. Seems the problem is back. Can't find 1.53 tarball.\nBest regards,\nEdouard. Do you know why wekan is complaining about that ?. So the regular crashes has nothing to do with bcrypt ?\nI will try 1.53.8 and see if it still crash so often. If it does I will open a new issue.\nThanks for your help. What I mean is that quite often, the nodejs process crash/die. And the only thing I saw in the logs was the line about bcrypt. Is there a way to have more verbosity, or any log ?. As I said I'm not using docker, it's an install from source. We can't use docker. I will check out what versions of nodejs and Mongo are specified n the docker-compose.yml. Thanks for this pointer.. It seems that the problem is only from running the bundle. 1.53.8 was so unstable that we couldn't even load any board. We have very few users (< 100), and less then 1000 boards.\nNow I've migrated to a docker swarm cluster, running portainer and everything is now fine.\nI suspect the old apache from CentOS7 to be part of the problem, because direct acces to wekan was a bit better. With docker, we are now up-to-date, even if we lost the control of the versions.. ",
    "mfshiu": "Use this package in Wekan is VERY important: \n\nmixmax:smart-disconnect\n\nMeteor connection cost is very expensive, if your MongoDB contains large data, your active users are over several hundreds, you must use the package to auto disconnect user when they leave their focus on Wekan over 1 minute. I read the article by Eliezer Steinbock, then make my Wekan CPU ultra down.. Can you post again? I miss the answer. Thanks.. Is Wekan installed on your own laptop/desktop, or remote server? \nIn remote server for production\nIn my Windows for development. After trying current Wekan, I found the current Wekan 0.50 is work, it can support to login for multiple clients.\nBut my Wekan is started from 0.10 that has no such feature, client will be kick-off while the same account is login. \nIt's hard to merge my Wekan to 0.50, can you tell me how to add multiple-login feature to old version Wekan?. Thank you very much. I am trying to merge my old Wekan to version 0.50.. I have already developed some not bad features to my Wekan, like custom fields, moving card on mobile phone and filter cards by keyword. I will try to update to Wekan and make some contribution. In addition, I have integrated my Wekan with RIOT (http://riot.im/) that user can be notified immediately on cell phone while Wekan cards changed. \n. I will take some time to do. It's my pleasure.. I know why my Wekan cannot do multiple login.\nI monkey-patch accounts loginWithPassword of accounts-apssword package to do LDAP login, that cause such problem, but I still don't know why.\nNow I try to register login handler to complete the LDAP login feature, then my Wekan can multiple login again.\nI plan to do a package for LDAP login of Wekan..

Also that \"admin\" user is available when it is a new installation. Not works if wekan is just updated(not the first user, or the first user registered after update become that \"admin\"). ",
    "ertanalytics": "I started with \"can edit\", but tried both and then change user types in sandstorm from admin to user to visitor.  They are jevans@mailinator.com and ddooley@mailinator.com, not sure if that is too similar with the bug or not.  When I created a board with the jevans username I was able to share and view both other members including the original primary admin account.  I am only using email authentication with codes for logins.  I am also on the latest version of everything stable if that helps.  End goal would be to allow the two other users to see but not edit the board and I would be able to drag and drop their member names to the various cards.  I don't want them creating their own boards or install other grains etc.\nThank you for looking into the possibilities.\n. David - I was able to get the users to appear in the members list by doing this procedure:\n1.  Invite user to sandstorm server\n2.  Once the user has created an account, make sure they are set to 'User' status before sending the Wekan board invitation.\n3.  As the user, login, create the account, then open and log into the board.\nI will mark this as resolved for now since this seems to serve my purposes.  It seems like if the board and invite existed before the user it could be recreated.  It might help to do some testing around this if it is intended to be smoother.  All my failed attempts are visible on those mailinator emails, I changed the usernames for privacy reasons on my actual site.\n. No idea why, but it all the sudden started working.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks dwrensha!  I will make a note and keep track of that other issue.\n. Dragging the members from the display board is handy and removing it would take away this nice feature.  While having a 'Remove Member' can be misleading, perhaps in the interim we could have a 'Hide Member' to avoid confusion.  I have non-member who has been removed from a board for almost a year and due to a restore of the environment one user has three different member names.  xe7 suggested I do an install of the non-sandstorm and do some imports and exports to get around the issue just to hide these extra members, however I would like this to not keep happening if possible.\nAnother idea would be to add the 'Remove Member' option and add a warning message to have them also verify the sandstorm user is also removed.\nLong term a simple LDAP style API query of whether a user has access to a grain or not is probably ideal.. It looks like it last worked on 9/1/2017 and after the credentials were put in it was showing the full json text data of the wekan board and the subsequent steps parsed that json data.\nThe error:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"cards-to-csv.py\", line 62, in <module>\n    script = soup.find(\"script\", attrs={'type' : 'text/inject-data'}).children.next()\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'children'\nIs related to the parser not finding what it is expecting to start the parsing.  Any ideas to navigate to the json data should fix this problem.  Please let me know and I will update my code.  I am trying a few different paths to see if I can figure out a way to get back to the json data with card titles etc.  I would like all the board data if possible for the export.\n@ocdtrekkie - I am just instructing Selenium to open the URL.  Once the page loads I grab the background data and immediately close the browser:\n`browser2 = Browser('chrome')\nbrowser2.visit(apiURLnoAuth) # Fill in the url\nsleep(1) #Time in seconds\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(browser2.html,'html.parser')\nbrowser2.quit()`\nOnce the data is assigned to the 'soup' variable, I am done with Selenium.\n. @xet7 - This appears to be broken as well in Sandstorm.  The download starts, but fails 'Failed - Server problem' while download backup on Sandstorm continues to work.\n\nOn 9/1/2017 and earlier, visiting the API URL had the export data readily available and that was what the script I wrote was parsing..

The only thing that has worked was the export URL thus far.  I am betting the directory structure inhibits the normal API request functions, however I am a bit green on API testing and might be missing something.. I added a bounty to this issue to try to get links made for the API that also work in Sandstorm.

I have reached out to xet7 to assist and he is having trouble with his sandstorm based building VM.  If anyone has a working development environment to test the REST API for sandstorm version and build from it to get it to production please let me know, I would like to get this feature as soon as possible..

Page source has gotten too big to be properly parsed as an alternative to this API.

I get status OK response, but it just gives me the same response text no matter what API commands I put in:\n`\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\nWekan\n%7B%22fast-render-data%22%3A%7B%22collectionData%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22subscriptions%22%3A%7B%22boards%22%3A%7B%22%5B%5D%22%3Atrue%7D%7D%7D%7D\n\n\n<strong>meteor_runtime_config</strong> = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(\"%7B%22meteorRelease%22%3A%22METEOR%401.6.0.1%22%2C%22meteorEnv%22%3A%7B%22NODE_ENV%22%3A%22production%22%2C%22TEST_METADATA%22%3A%22%7B%7D%22%7D%2C%22PUBLIC_SETTINGS%22%3A%7B%22sandstorm%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22ROOT_URL%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A4000%22%2C%22ROOT_URL_PATH_PREFIX%22%3A%22%22%2C%22appId%22%3A%22dvyihgykyzec6y1dpg%22%2C%22SANDSTORM%22%3Atrue%2C%22accountsConfigCalled%22%3Atrue%2C%22autoupdateVersion%22%3A%2243fee1ee295407330ac727c00083754ef519cfaa%22%2C%22autoupdateVersionRefreshable%22%3A%22a20cc749bf1d8e6b7cee5304126efa2415be9d02%22%2C%22autoupdateVersionCordova%22%3A%22none%22%7D\"))\n\n\n`. Will this commit be in an experimental version or on Oasis or somewhere I can test outside of my environment?. Is there a chance someone could test this functionality?  I am getting hangs in the experimental link on both browser types.  Do we know the normal testing procedure for sandstorm Wekan and what features are tested and if we can get this feature included?\n\n. After running the same tests, I received the same bad response for the test response in the latest version on Oasis.  Below is the testing method in Python 3.6.5 with requests package version number 2.18.4 on Oasis Wekan version 1.49.0-2018-09-17 tested 9/28/2018.\n`import requests\nimport json\nhttps://api-ec9e7c51610a73ebf1e11001caf8b1dd.oasis.sandstorm.io#L92rf5G3B3rIsk8Z1USnnM-6ZjbRFugyWZWCaxP4iDt\nAPIBegURL = 'https://Bearer:nS_0nDcc63vZ9QWpuNCkPK5BBMGLDiLxP-0JNhVKz79@api-a5587d9539ca906a2aa5e1eebc7dac89.oasis.sandstorm.io'\nAPIBegURL = 'https://Bearer:L92rf5G3B3rIsk8Z1USnnM-6ZjbRFugyWZWCaxP4iDt@api-ec9e7c51610a73ebf1e11001caf8b1dd.oasis.sandstorm.io'\nEndURL = '#L92rf5G3B3rIsk8Z1USnnM-6ZjbRFugyWZWCaxP4iDt'\nCommands\nConfirm API still works for exporting entire board\nexportCommand = '/api/boards/sandstorm/export?authToken='\nAPIRequest = APIBegURL + exportCommand + EndURL\nresponse = requests.get(APIRequest)\nprint(response.text) ## Returns full export\nBad Request Result for User Addition\nusersCommand = '/api/boards/sandstorm/users?authToken='\nAPIRequest = APIBegURL + usersCommand + EndURL\nresponse = requests.post(APIRequest,\ndata='',\njson='{ \"username\": \"tester\", \"password\": \"tester\", \"email\": \"tester@example.com\", \"fromAdmin\": \"true\" }'\n)\nprint(response.text) ## Returns bad request`\n\n\n. Verified the export does show data again.  The other API features do not appear to work including the user addition example, but at least the export is working again with the API.. This was working prior to the upgrade I did on 5/3/2018 to answer xet7.

After some experiment I realize it's the LANGUAGE that make my browser show a blank page.\nAs I mentioned in my last comment, the my browser console showed some ERROR info, of witch the first line said language zh does not exist. According to this I set my browser to use englishas the display language  (I'm Chinese and use Chrome in Chinese by default of course) and refresh wekan page, and the sign-up page showed up.. Same issue when migrate to new version with old database, thought it may be some kind of database corruption but not sure about it.\nThe version iteration should be more careful, especially when database involved.. I just find out that those characters which shown as light font seem like japanese characters. Is it possible that wekan involve japanese fonts into zh-cn lang accidently?. @xet7 Thx for reminding, those 2 fonts mentioned in #707 are both ja-JP fonts, which could be verified by googling. Since there are people who need them, then it's good to import them, however the priority or logic need to be modified.\nAs you know (or maybe not?) ja-JP lang includes a lot of zh-CN chars (known as kanji), so any qualified ja-JP font should includes those kanji chars which are pretty close to zh-CN, e.g. pic below shows a zh-CN char which means \"write\":\n\nand here is the corresponding kanji char in ja-JP (which also means \"write\"):\n\nAs you can see, they are very similar, but still not same, and they are rendered differently in their own fonts. Which means, although they are different chars, they have same unicode (and same utf8 code of course). All the appearence differences rely on their own fonts to be presented. From the string codec level, they are just same bytes, but shown differently in different fonts (of different lang). If it's rendered with zh-CN font, then it looks as a zh-CN char; if it's rendered with ja-JP font, it looks as a ja-JP char (kanji).\nBack into my heading screenshot in this issue, you could find this part:\n\nThe english word \"markdown\" is fine, the next zh-CN char \"\u7f16\" is fine too, and then here is a weird \"\u5199\" which should be renderd in zh-CN font but somehow rendered in ja-JP font instead, which messed things.\nSo the problem is, the font list has a wrong priority for zh-CN, or the lang detection for font choosing is either buggy or missing.\nBTW, half of the zh-CN translation is done by me, which should not be the issue, because content does not affect the rendering of characters.\nRegards.. @xet7 Maybe not, I'm pretty sure you can tell me which file should be modified to remove those 2 fonts from #707.\nBesides, mannual settings should not be necessary to make all lang chars display right. Most website use a common fonts list which can handle most of languages well, including chinese and japanese. So there definitely is a good and easy way to solve this problem. Still it looks like those 2 fonts from #707 is not imported in a right way, anyway the old versions have no problem as this issue.\nLet's find out how did they put those two fonts into the source and repair it. ;). @xet7 \nThx for the suggestion, I'll try. Meanwhile would look forward for a offical patch.\nProbably need more help here, leave this issue open for tracking.\nRegards.. @xet7 \nBeyond my expertise...could only give some instances. The following fonts list is from a blog theme of an open-source application called \"Leanote\", which seems adaptive for most languages I've met:\n\n\"Libre Baskerville\", \"Lucida Grande\", \"Hiragino Sans GB\", \"Hiragino Sans GB W3\", \"Microsoft YaHei\", \"wenquanyi micro hei\", sans-serif, \"Apple Color Emoji\";\n\nAnyway most website are adaptive to multiple languages, e.g. Github, Youtbe, etc.. @xet7 \nBringing new infomation after some searching and researching...\nFirst, my thought of using a fixed font-family to cover all langs is naive. Since a lot of Han characters (the proper noun, including all the chars from Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc) share same Unicode and rely on specific fonts to show their different glyphs in different langs, it is just not feasible to use a fixed font-family to show all the ideographs in different langs correctly. Moreover, if there are different  ideographs with same Unicode, then it would be a trouble to show them in their own appereance seperately and correctly, because to do that we need to change the font character by character through the whole page. Overall, the best we could archive is to detect the lang the user choose, and take a particular font-family for that language.\nRoboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, Helvetica, \"Yu Gothic\", \"Meiryo\", sans-serif may fit Japanese pretty well I suppose, since Yu Gothic & Meiryo are all ja fonts. Meiryo represents Han characters in a way very close to common Chinese fonts, but Yu Gothic does that in a very Japanese style. As for Chinese users, Arial, 'Microsoft YaHei', 'WenQuanYi Micro Hei', sans-serif widely used.\nPS. If you are interested in the situation of Han characters in Unicode, view Han unification and CJK. @xet7 \nI find a way to fix it (temporarily) by modifying a .css file inside the official released tarball, without building from source code. After tar xf the released '.tar.gz', just cd into bundle dir, and grep -r <keyword> to find the .css file which contains the font-family used for Wekan. The keyword for grep could be 'Yu Gothic', 'Meiryo',  'Helvetica' etc. When the .css file is found, give it write permission, and edit it (remove those 2 Japanese fonts in this case), save and quit. Then just do a normal npm install and the modification is done.\nI also modify some i18n for zh-CN in the same way above, based on 0.16 release.\nLife is wonderful if no need to rebuild the source code, right? ;). BTW, the original concise font-family Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif render Chinese pretty well. The reason I suppose is 'Arial' & 'sans-serif' tell the browser to use system default zh-CN fonts in my Windows 10 OS. So, for us Chinese users, it really has no need to change that original font-family.. @xet7 \nHave tried version 0.16 without discovering this issue, and versions ever since 0.11.0 until 0.18 do not have this issue if I remember correctly. Maybe the new codes cause it again?. ",

    "elioqoshi": "That looks pretty good! I'd put the title of the board on the same place where it is currently in Wekan (same also in Trello).

    "grokky1": "Agree we also use WIP limits, but since wekan doesn't have it, we duplicate some of the board on our physical whiteboard, and write the WIP limits manually. Sucks I know, but important.. @amadilsons I think it should be similar to how it's used elsewhere.\nI think that maybe \"WIP Limit (3)\" is too \"wordy\". It should simply have the number next to the name, for example:\nBacklog (*) | Ready (6) | In-progress (3) | Testing (3) | Complete (*)\nOr something like that. The \"(*)\" is optional / unnecessary.\n\nBut there is another questions to consider:\nShould user be allowed to add more tasks than allowed for that column? So if the WIP limit is 3, can user add 4 tasks? If yes, then some tools show it in red e.g. \"4 of 3\". If no, then user cannot add a task until he clears a task. I think we should have this as an option, as different teams work differently.\nTo keep it simple for now, maybe we can just ignore this issue.. @amadilsons I agree - in our team we never add more tasks than the limit!!! Like you said it defeats the purpose!. @synergico I've seen it both ways. In my current team we use (3). But in the past I've also seen (1/3).\nIt depends on the maximum number:\n- in a large team its better to have (11/16) because it's easier than counting the tasks in that column.\n- but in a small team, it represents only the maximum, and the number in progress can be easily counted just by looking at the tasks in that column. So that extra /x is unnecessary \"noise\".\nIdeally it should be a config option - but that means more work. It depends on how much work we should put into version 1 of this feature! \ud83d\ude06. ",
    "amadilsons": "@xet7 any idea of how the layout for this feature should look like?\nMaybe \"WIP Limit {{ limit }}\" beneath the list title and the option to edit it in List Activities popup? What do you think about that?. I'm not sure the user should be allowed to add more than the limit. Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of the WIP limit?\nBut I also agree it should be an option!\nFor now, I'll go for a simpler version of this feature, not allowing the user to add more tasks than the limit. \nAfter that, we consider solving that issue!. I'm working on a solution for this issue! \nI'll try to submit it soon. @xet7 Is there any specific approach you think should be taken to go about this issue??. @ocdtrekkie Yes, of course it should be editable. It autopopulates with the number of cards in the list only as a default first value, but you should be able to change it!\nI've just tried to use that feature and it worked fine. I'm afraid I don't understand the problem :/. For sure, I will add a 'Soft Limit' option.\nSorry it took me so long to answer. I've just submitted a new PR #1319 with this feature.\nI've tried to test it for all the use cases I could remember but might have missed something!\nFeel free to check it out and see if suits your needs :). That happens because 0 is the default value for the limit when the list is created. Thinking about it, it isn't very smart..\nJust to make sure I understand the problem, the value 0 only shows up when you enable the WIP limit for the first time on an empty list, right? Because that should be the only case where that happens.\nIf you enable the limit for the first time in a list, and that list already has cards in it, it should default to the number of cards already on the list. Is that what happens to you??. So, I've just submitted a new PR for the feature request #1311 and at the same time tried to address the problem you described.\nUnfortunately, I was not able to recreate the problem you mentioned!! The only situation I could see where the WIP value was 0, was the one I described in my previous comment. I might have also not understood your issue exactly..\nAnyhow, whenever you have time, test my new PR #1319 for the problem you were having and check if it still occurs. I've tested it for the use cases I could remember, but might have missed something.. ",

I've spent some time debugging and I think I know where it's failing.\nIt works fine if your URL is domain.tld or domain.tld:port, however if you want to have wekan at a URL like this: domain.tld/wekan it seems to fail.\nUsing your fork with domain.tld/wekan would end up with domain.tld/wekan/wekan/b/3k3j42... when clicking a card to display card details.\nI haven't been able to figure out how to make it work, but I'm sure you'll be able to.. Thanks, that new line works perfectly with my scenario of domain.tld/wekan!. @Serubin I couldn't get it to work simply adding your flow-router and removing the kadira one so I ended up cloning the kadira one to a local packages dir and simply applying your fix.\nIt would also work if I cloned yours and renamed the package to kadira, else it would say it was missing it.\nYour last fix is working perfectly though so thank you for that.. @Serubin I created a dir in my home dir named localpackages where I cloned kadirahq:flow-router to. I then edited the file for your fix. (I'm guessing the same would work for your package, but as previously mentioned the project was looking for kadira so had to name the local package that)\nI had to set an environment variable in my .bashrc and .profile to make meteor aware of the local packages. (At first it didn't work when I tried to add the variable but that's because meteor looks for a different variable after a certain version, and we're using a version before that change)\nexport PACKAGE_DIRS=\"$HOME/localpackages\"\nI also made the version of the local package one version higher than the original one to make sure that it found and used the right one.\nI used these commands to remove and add the package to the project (It should say which version it updates to):\nmeteor remove kadira:flow-router\nmeteor add kadira:flow-router\nHope this helps.. Instead of creating a user upon first run you could also put in a check on the registration, and if the registration is for the first user, make that user the admin account. That would mean no extra/new environment variables.. Isn't that a different issue all together if the register dialog hangs? If that issue is solved, then there's no issue in having the first created user be the first admin user.. @NoodleBB You're able to add a registered member to a board by going into the board itself and clicking the + sign in the upper right corner and then simply typing their username.\nScreenshot: https://goo.gl/X5oWKA\nI think invitation by the admin panel is for inviting new members into a closed system only.

Since I have a Redirect rule from http to https in apache, the url pass through apache and the rewrite is loaded. \nBut this is also not working for me, since the page reload takes time and and sidebar is set to hidden xD.

As you may know, ToroDB Stampede is on beta right now, in fact, we are looking for real applications to find (and solve!) possible incompatibilities and we would be glad to help if you find problems. On the other hand, Stampede has been designed to read from a MongoDB. We have another product called ToroDB Server which can be used instead of MongoDB (talking the same protocol), but it is on developer preview version and Meteor is not supported (as ToroDB Server does not support replication yet).\n\\cc @ahachete.

    "lonix1": "SQLite should also be considered. Simplest option - runs everywhere, zero setup.\nA good idea is to copy various other services (e.g. gogs/gitea)  - out of the box, sqlite is supported. But if you want something more \"serious\" then you need to add mysql/postgres/mongo.. If the board already exists, then you can't use the \"export as template\" trick. So this is still a good idea.. It needs to be more than just gray - wekan needs a \"dark mode\".\nMay devs use dark mode in every tool (browser, IDE, terminal, various apps, etc.) so changing between light-mode and dark-mode apps is surprising while you're in \"the zone\".\nPS: there are browser addons like \"Dark Reader\", that do this automatically. But the colors are not so good, so wekan look strange.. I created some css overrides with Stylish. It's not complete but I'm happy with it. I work in swimlanes mode, so that is what I changed (not list mode or calendar mode).\nColors:\n- adds dark mode, I used vscode as a reference\nOther:\n- hides various useless icons and things\n- hides  \"add card\", \"add swimlane\", \"add list\" links, until hovered (I find these very \"noisy\")\n````css\n/ HIDE PERMANENTLY -------------------------------------------------- /\n/ various /\n.wekan-logo,\n.close-card-details { display:none; }\n/ header text /\nheader-quick-access >ul >li:nth-child(1) >a { font-size:0; }\nheader-quick-access >ul >li:nth-child(1) >a >.fa-home{ font-size:12px; margin:0; }\n/ popup menu titles (boards, swimlanes, lists, cards, labels) /\n.pop-over >.header { display:none; }\n/ OPTIONAL \n   card fields: received, start, due, end, members, requested, assigned\n   I rarely use these... uncomment if you want to hide them /\n/\n.card-details-item.card-details-item-received,\n.card-details-item.card-details-item-start,\n.card-details-item.card-details-item-due,\n.card-details-item.card-details-item-end,\n.card-details-item.card-details-item-members,\n.card-details-item.card-details-item-name { display:none; }\n.card-details-items:empty { display:none; }\n/\n/ HIDE UNTIL HOVER -------------------------------------------------- /\n/ header \"+\" button /\nheader-quick-access .fa-plus { display:none; }\nheader-quick-access:hover .fa-plus { display:inherit; }\n/ \"add card\" links (use visibility rather than display so items don't jump) /\n                    .open-minicard-composer { visibility:hidden; }\n.list.js-list:hover .open-minicard-composer { visibility:visible; }\n                    .list-header-menu { visibility:hidden; }\n.list.js-list:hover .list-header-menu { visibility:visible; }\n/ \"add list/swimlane\" links (use visibility rather than display so items don't jump) /\n.list.js-list-composer       >.list-header { visibility:hidden; }\n.list.js-list-composer:hover >.list-header { visibility:visible; }\n/ DARK MODE -------------------------------------------------- /\n/ headers /\nheader-quick-access, #header { background-color:rgba(0,0,0,.75) !important; }\nheader .board-header-btn:hover { background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.3) !important; }\n/ backgrounds: swimlanes, lists /\n.swimlane { background-color:rgba(0,0,0,1); }\n.swimlane >.swimlane-header-wrap,\n.swimlane >.list.js-list,\n.swimlane >.list-composer.js-list-composer { background-color:rgba(0,0,0,.9); }\n/ foregrounds: swimlanes, lists /\n.list >.list-header, .swimlane-header { color:rgba(255,255,255,.7); }\n/ minicards /\n.minicard { background-color:rgba(255,255,255,.4); }\n.minicard-wrapper.is-selected .minicard,\n.minicard:hover,\n.minicard-composer.js-composer,\n.open-minicard-composer:hover { background-color:rgba(255,255,255,.8) !important; color:#000; }\n.minicard, .minicard .badge { color:#fff; }\n.minicard:hover .badge, .minicard-wrapper.is-selected .badge { color:#000; }\n/ cards /\n.card-details,\n.card-details .card-details-header { background-color:#ccc; }\n/ sidebar /\n.sidebar-tongue, .sidebar-shadow { background-color:#666 !important; }\n.sidebar-content h3, .sidebar-content .activity-desc { color:rgba(255,255,255,.7) !important; }\n````\nIf anyone improves on this, please share here.. Doesn't work for me either: Ubuntu 18.04, Firefox 62.0, Chromium 69.0.3497.81.\nHowever I don't get those errors, it just silently fails for me.. I don't know meteor, so I fixed this with a Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script and some jQuery.\nI used this script but changed it so it works for wekan - it drags horizontally and vertically, but does nothing if 1) there is already a card/list/swimlane drag underway or 2) a card details is open.\nMake sure to change http://localhost:8080/b/* to wherever your wekan server is.\n````js\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name         wekan\n// @match        http://localhost:8080/b/*\n// ==/UserScript==\n(function() {\n  \"use strict\";\n$.fn.attachDragger = function() {\n    var attachment = false, lastPosition, position, difference;\n    $(this).on(\"mousedown mouseup mousemove\", function(e) {\n      var elementToScroll = $(\".board-canvas\");\n      if (elementToScroll.hasClass(\"is-dragging-active\") ||\n          elementToScroll.find(\".card-details\").length ||\n          $(\"body >.ui-draggable-dragging\").length) {           // ignore when dragging a label onto a card\n        elementToScroll.css(\"cursor\", \"default\");\n        attachment = false;\n        return;\n      }\n      if (e.type == \"mousedown\") {\n        attachment = true;\n        lastPosition = [e.clientX, e.clientY];\n      }\n      if (e.type == \"mouseup\") {\n        elementToScroll.css(\"cursor\", \"default\");\n        attachment = false;\n      }\n      if (e.type == \"mousemove\" && attachment == true) {\n        elementToScroll.css(\"cursor\", \"pointer\");\n        position = [e.clientX, e.clientY];\n        difference = [ (position[0]-lastPosition[0]), (position[1]-lastPosition[1]) ];\n        elementToScroll.scrollLeft(elementToScroll.scrollLeft() - difference[0]);\n        elementToScroll.scrollTop(elementToScroll.scrollTop() - difference[1]);\n        lastPosition = [e.clientX, e.clientY];\n      }\n    });\n    $(window).on(\"mouseup\", function() { attachment = false; });\n  }\n$(\"#content\").attachDragger();\n})();\n````\n. For those who are interested in \"dark mode\" there is related discussion here. +1 for @KuenzelIT's recycle bin idea. To delete a card (not \"done\", just delete it), it would be nice to drag it to a recycle bin icon. Much faster than going through that very long menu which needs lots of scrolling.\nI added a separate issue because this issue is about \"completion\", not about \"deletion\".. @xet7 So the benefit is for those who want the latest bits quickly. If we are on a slower adoption cycle, I assume that docker hub is ok.\nThanks for the explanation.\nBTW it is really funny that another company is better at docker, than docker itself!. @rjevnikar Hmm, that is certainly an option but I don't think it would work well for the same reason labels don't work well - what is a \"normal\" color and what is a \"story points\" color - it gets confusing. But it is still an option to think about.\nI think the best option for now is to use the [5] in the title, e.g. As a x, I want to y so that z [5].\nBTW, not having another field on the card is a good point, but keep in mind most users won't use it so it won't show anything. Also, if we can agree on a \"generic\" use for that, then I might use it for story points, but someone else might use it for something else that makes sense to his workflow, so it could be quite useful.. Closing in favor of #2039. Closing in favor of #2039. @xet7 \n\nAn example from JIRA - doesn't need to be like this, it's just for an idea.

I am using the mquandalle/wekan:latest docker container.. Good feedback.\nA bit daunting but I'll try: I'm an experienced Java developer familiar with the toolset that goes with it like Spring, Hibernate, tomcat etc.  I have trouble spelling JavaScript :-).  And before looking at Wekan I'd never heard of Meteor.  There's jQuery expertise in-house (a colleague roomed with John Resig at RIT) but no Meteor.\nLet's see if I can get a plausible dev environment going.  Obviously the basic plumbing works.. ",

I could not find it in any settings, and it is hard to keep track of which cards have subtasks.\nI am hoping to use the subtasks to create a milestones board with each card having subtasks to be completed to complete the milestones.

Added bounty of $350. Added $300 more to reach target request of $650.\n2nd $300 expires in 3 months, first $350 does not.. @xet7 Thanks for the heads up.  I will lean on the community for proper code review/following your guidelines for submission.\n@andresmanelli if you could submit a few screenshots/concepts when you have a moment, would be fantastic.. @andresmanelli Cool.  My general idea is to then further extend templating to boards followed by users if that helps from a code point of view.. @andresmanelli Ok cool - you rock.  Consider also the concept of templated users (ie with boards that contain swimlanes, etc). @xet7 I will not be able to test for sometime due to family/travel schedule, etc.  If the community thinks its ok, I will not hold the bounty hostage and can release - hopefully if there are issues later that I find they will be fixed by @andresmanelli ?\nIs docker image updated @xet7  ?.

    "ChangePlaces": "Any update on this? Awesome absolutely essential feature for real-world use!. this is done in phabricator with tags. e.g. putting a tag of one project into a task makes it show up in that project as well as the project it was created inside of, so I'd imagine it could be done here with board titles instead of tags?\n.

    "jonculver": "Is there any news on this? I'd love to try out wekan and this feature is a must-have for my usecase. It looks like #1063 has been closed but I'm not sure if a new pull request has been made yet?. ",
    "papoola": "Guys any update regarding this precious beautiful feature request ? Is there something I could do to speed up the process?. Hi, inspired by @tugal 's code I spent hours today to find my way through code and to do my first commit: https://github.com/papoola/wekan. Dear @jLouzado you are welcome. It's a pleasure to be part of this. I sure would need your help from time to time. Previously I had to search alot until I found about publications github.com/papoola/wekan/blob/feature-custom-fields/server/publications/boards.js#L77 I'm new to meteorjs. Just to give you an update on this feature dear friends. So far dropdown string date number fields are supported. Once I finish checkbox I might need someone to help to test and debug. Hi all. @Creanimo thanks for your input. So far this feature that I am building is similar to Trello's one at mentioned by @xet7 at very top of this page. Yes idea is to show also on the mini card (configurable per field like in Trello). I have tried zenkit in the past but I will watch the video to refresh my mind. Thanks!\nLot of work is already done, but still need to add one more custom field type (checkbox) and still haven't got chance to do it. I also saw #1022 from @mfshiu hope we are not both doing the same thing!\n@jLouzado could you please pull my current code from here https://github.com/papoola/wekan/tree/feature-custom-fields and give me your thoughts. It's still not finished but I like to know we are all aligned. Everyone else feel free to try out the code. All idea's and suggestions are welcome but for now please keep it at minimum so we can wrap up this feature ( so without other fancy custom field types and sorting etc ). After this one is merged, other nice to haves could follow in next features.. @xet7 no worries I can take care of clean pull request ( using rebase ). Custom field works without checkbox also. But code needs some more testing before merging. Yes lets wait for @jLouzado and @mfshiu comments. Good luck with your releases!. @feuerball11 glad you have picked this up with help of @xet7 . I spent some time for the code unfortunately we never used wekan in our project any more and I didn't find spare time and priority to do this. If there are small questions here and there which I could help let me know. But looks like you are doing well ;-) . Good job @feuerball11 and @xet7 for helping finish the code. Let me know where to sign the CLA.. Thanks @ocdtrekkie done!. Thanks again @feuerball11 for helping out with merging and fixing. Checkbox was indeed last type I was going to implement but at the end didnt get chance to work on it. I hope you all enjoy working with custom fields even though still more work needs to be done like filters as @feuerball11 mentioned. I checked latest version yesterday and I saw there were custom fields in filtering panel, however it was I believe showing cards containing custom fields, and not filtering based on custom field values. Maybe thats what @feuerball11 means by advanced filtering which is wip. One other must have feature would be when custom fields are deleted or perhaps drop down values are changed to update values in cards accordingly. This was something I knew was needed back then. Not sure if @feuerball11 has implemented this already.. @feuerball11 best bugs are the ones you find all by your self :-p. ",
    "Creanimo": "I am really excited for this! Will custom fields also show on the card in the board view not just in the details?. Also, you might want to checkout zenkit.com, which is the kanban king of custom fields. It can display and sort all kinds of things based on custom fields and there even is a custom field to link cards and field entries from other cards from other boards allowing for some very powerful big to small nesting of boards.\nCustom fields in Zenkit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5J4w8f4Bz8 I like their label field a lot, so you can have multiple kinds of labels. I guess that's what we will use dropdown for?. +1\nI urgently need a calendar view as well. I think a calendar (especially with drag and drop) could turn wekan into a very effective project management software.\nI am quite new to github and I saw that sometimes people put a bounty on implementing features. Is this a possibility here?. @killua-eu That is a very complete and helpful list you posted. It would be amazing if even a fraction of these features could be added!\nIs there any dev here who wants to tackle this soon/next? I would rather hire someone who is already familiar with wekan.. I am very excited for this!\nWill the calendar be able to show the cards of selected and all boards?. Is there an ETA yet? O:-). Do you have an ETA for us? My pledge at bounty source has a 3 month deadline on it, but I will re-pledge should the deadline pass.. Just want to say how much I appreciate your hard work and that I hope that more people will use your commercial services and bountysource to support the project. Is great that wekan is still alive and developing. Side note about SSL, I am using Wekan in cloudron.io which already provides Let's Encrypt certificates for all apps. Not sure how that works technically but maybe you can benefit from some source code that is used for that.\nBack to topic: I have been using Zenkit which has (among many other) a calendar view (and custom fields which are also on the roadmap). It's amazing how that takes a kanban board to a very capable project management. I think with a calendar view we can promote Wekan as a project management software, which might get you more commercial users. At least for my studio I try to use as little apps as possible and merging my brainstorming and collection tool (Wekan) with project management will streamline things a lot. Thanks again! I am excited for the future of Wekan!. This would be very useful!\nMay I add:\n- due in the previous week (great for weeklies)\n- overdue\nHow about a way to save presets of combined filters like \"all of my urgent cards due in next week\"?.

    "feuerball11": "Is this still in development? \n@papoola seems to have done a lot for custom fields, but stopped late 2017. \nOn the Roadmap it seems that @xet7 want to take over this. Youre planing to make it from new, or work on the base of @papoola? \nK/R Ignatz. Thanks. I took a look at the code and the conflicts, and I was able to bring up a version with the custom fields (Merge Conflicts was mainly copy/paste stuff). \nHowever, it seems that the checkboxes dont work for me. I Still have no idea from the code (or even meteor). What should i do now? Create a pull request with what i merged, and we open a issue for the checkbox (and what else might appear, i didnt test in-depth, couse i'm new to wekan, too ^^) or should i try to figure out whats broken, and fix it, with the potential that i never get it finishd? \n(Mergin the current state would be better then having no custom fields at all, right?)\nI will try to figure out what the problem is, and maybe even try to code the custom fields into search and filter, but that can take time, and i may never finish that. \nK/R Ignatz. @xet7 I didnt mean the checklist. But the checkbox CustomField Type. But as far as i understand the code, this feature wasnt build. So i'll remove checkbox types from the selection, and will commit that. Then customFields with Text,Date,Number and Dropdown would be implemented, and i can learn how to build a customField for checkboxes ^^ \nI'll do a pullrequest when i'm done. \nAnd please, i didnt do anything to custom fields, all the hard work was done by @papoola. I just finish what he had started.. @xet7 \nFound one problem: \nTHe layout of the detail view from the card is a bit strange now. I'm trying to figure out where to look, and why it happens.\n\nIf you want to see for yourself, my current dev test is on: https://maschath.de/wekan-dev. Okay, It took me a few attempts, but I seem to have solved the issues with the styling. Thanks for the tips. \nNow I only need to figure out how that with the pull request works ^^\n. Ok. Think i got it. \npull request is done: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1642\nif something is missing, or buggy, feel free to contact me, or response to this issue. I will try my best to solve it.. @xet7 I Corrected all Lint errors i found, and the Loca (Was only the one translation) \nStrangly codacy shows some lint errors, i cant reproduce with \"npm run lint\" \nShould i fix them based on codacy, or is this fine? (Just some indents it seems) \n@papoola Hope you sign the CLA, would be a shame after all that work, that it fails on some licence agreement ^^. @xet7  Already done ^^. Okey, I done some small Migration (Just adding an empty customFields array to Cards seems to be enough) \nI didnt double-check this jet. (I Only made an Upgrade, to test the bug, saw the bug, wrote the Migration, updated the bugged version, worked) I Didnt test it on a clean upgrade jet, but i'll need to do some other stuff now, so i will make a quick pullrequest, and if it is likly do make problems, or makes problems, i'll loock over it this evening. \nPullrequest https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1644\nEdit: Double checked it. Seems to Work. @ocdtrekkie  this is actually not implemented jet. I'll look into this, after i did some \"basic advanced filters\" . Actually i'm doing \"show fields on cards\" directly with the advanced filter, couse it will help me testing.. @papoola no that is not implemented jet. Thanks for the info. \nAnother thing: I'm not so good in styling things, so if anyone has better ideas how to style the custom fields on minicard, give me some ideas ^^\nit currently looks like this:\n\n. Okey. Basic advanced Filters are working. Now i need to Cleanup code, delete debug lines, and add some small stuff around it, like description, reset Filter and correct error handling with wrong filters.\nAlright, i opend a pullrequest. \nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1646\nThere are still some smaller issues / todos, but the basic thing should work. . I'm currently busy with deleting stuff from the recycling-bin. When i'm done with this, i'll look again at custom fields and filters.. Just had an error on import from an Trello Board via JSON. \nOne of them seems to be related to CustomFields. (Missing CustoMFieldsWD, known error from migration.) \nI dont know if its completly from custom fields, or something else is in there, and custom fields are just a followup error, but it should be invested. (Probably i do it, after Deleting Boards) . Jet another found bug by myself: Advanced Filters dont work with Numbers or DropDown (Probably not with dates either) sigh. @DejfCold its an &&. (You can use '&&' '&' and 'and' as the same)\nthe spaces is a hard restriction at the moment. i dont know if i'll find time to remove this, but till then its required. . Some things i found while creating my own board:\n- Type of Custom Fields cant be changed, i dont think thats terrible bad, you still can delete it and redefine (remapping all existing values could lead to problems anyway) but it should be greyed out, so you know you cant edit\n- Dropdown Items on Card display there ID, not there Value\n- Missing Type: Float Numbers\n- Missing Type: Calculated (Thats kinda one dream from me, that you can have fields that contain calcualated values. For example for recipes: Total Wight = SUM( Butter, Milk, Flour))\nANd for Advanced Filters:\n- Additional Feature: Wildcards\n. I would post a public Wekan Board where i keep track of what i'm doing with custom Fields, But becouse of #1623 thats currently not possible. Sry.. I'm looking into this the days.. Timelines moved, and i have no time to do this. Sry. I want to concentrate on Custom Fields and Advanced Filters. I'm looking into deleting things from the recycling bin the days. . I Havent looked into this deeply jet, Mostly becouse my Company wants a Presentation Tomorrow, and i'm looking at bugs for CustomFields fist, now. \nBut i have something in mind like Deleting single Boards / Cards, and also Deleting the content from the Complete Recycling bin. \nOriginaly i only wanted to do so for Boards, but i last saw that there is a racycling bin also for Cards and Lists. (Also cards have already a delete Option) \nSo i guess i add a Delete option for lists, and look at deleting Cards, if there is something what needs to be done, to remove them finaly from the Database.\nIn worst case i'll look at a Admin option for Cleaning the Database.. Timelines moved, and i have no time to do this. Sry. I want to concentrate on Custom Fields and Advanced Filters. Improvement 1.: \nI could see this as an option in the creation of customFields. It depends on the usercase. If you want to have a new custom field for 1-3 cards, or just one board, and add it to all cards on all boards, you need time to remove all the custom fields. \nSo yes, as an option on the creation. \nImprovement 2: \nSounds good\nAddition 1:\nCheckboxes where planned by the original autor, i just finishd what was there. I put them on my todos, but i have deleting things from recycling bin, and a few bugfixes regarding custom fields and filter bevore that. \nFinal note:\nCustom Fields are still an WIP Feature, also issue #807 is still open.. I'm currently on Repairing issues regards the new customFields in Cards. Maybe that will be fixed allongside. . Hi, That has probalby to do something with the CustomFields Feature, I'm Currently looking into this. @vkb your sekond problem sounds more like a configuration issue... anyway, to your first problem, i opend a pullrequest that should fix this, just wait for @xet7 to include this. It should fix the issue.. Srsly? Indends again?\nto the indend lint errors:\nOn my system they show up diffrently then on codacy. For example line 166 in filter.js:\ncodacy: Expect indent 8, found 10\nMy system: \ni change to indent of 8:\ncodacy: \nMy system: Ecpected indent 10, found 8\nI dont know why this is happening, i'll talk to @xet7 later, and try to figure that out, but in the meantime it would be nice that this pullrequest will be accepted, becouse its a small fix for a huge problem ^^ and it would be sad if it dont get into code, just becouse of indents O.o. Known Problem. see #807 \n. Knwon Problem. See #807 (At least i think it was once written there... At least i know this problem exists). Codacy has still indent errors my linter isnt showing. fix for #1683 also added. Addad Markdown Support in the view on minicard. I'm not able to reproduce anything of this by myself.\n@Fran-KTA but if your working in the database already, could you may give me a json with the board data, and maybe the custom field data? Think that could help finding the problem\nedit\nOr just expord the board data in 1.04. . @Fran-KTA \nFrom what i was able to track down, this should be code used in cardDetails. \nI dont know why this is even a thing, becouse accesing a board shoudnt open up a card (or am i wrong here?) \nMaybe something is wrong in the swimline code of listsGroup or swimline. \nBut even then its kinda strange, becouse it says that thsi.find() is undefined... But thats a meteor function, it never shoud be undefined...\nSounds like a realy strange bug, some race condition or something....\nAnd becouse i'm not able to reproduce this, i cant investigate this. My only idea whould be to add an \nif (!this || !this.find) return; \nto line 10 in cardDetails.js, and hope for the best. (so that the creation process of th eboard dont stops, and it hopfully gets everything correct together) . So first i thought it is a problem with custom fields, but they just get ignored in the progress.\nThen i started to validate the json by hand, to find errors, here is what i found:\n\nLabels contains a Label with strange color value:\n\"_id\": \"s33cGi\",\n\"name\": \"Patch\",\n\"color\": \"Label 7\"\nAlso there are cards containg null as an labelId:\n\"labelIds\": [null, \"t732So\"],\n\"labelIds\": [null],\n@sfahrenholz maybe you can look up what these labels are supposed to be. they are on cards:\nzm0vctzmc344zcm\u00df8\nm8uzc3muzc\u00df8\nm8u\u00dfcr2t8u\u00dfmc42t\njm3c4tm8\u00df934tc8u4t\n\nMore i didnt found. I guess there is something bugged with the labels. I will investigate that later on.. Thats good enough. I have all infos i needes. Now i can look into the export code\nAm 16. Juni 2018 14:35:33 MESZ schrieb sfahrenholz notifications@github.com:\n\n@feuerball11\n\"_id\": \"s33cGi\", \"name\": \"Patch\", \"color\": \"Label 7\"\nThis is my anomization mistake, color is here \"black\" i just wanted to\nscrumble the tag \"name\"..\nto these cards i can only say: on the board they have only one label. i\ndont know where the NULL values come.

    "therampagerado": "@feuerball11 \nAbout 1. - yes, option for this in the swipe menu will be the perfect way. Currently on sandstorm when I check the checkbox there it does not show anywhere. Nor in the mini card, neither in the card expanded view. I have to click on the hamburger menu, edit custom fields and add them one by one. Is this the current supposed way of adding CF to a card?\nThank you @xet7 !\nLet's sum up a list of feature request about CF for @feuerball11 when he's available again for work on this one! \n@xet7 what do you think about my checksum idea? Can this be implemented in the original checksums? - A global template with set name and options for our users to check where the card's creator can delete the unnecessary items only. This will speed the card creation with ~30 seconds in our case where we need to have ~30 cards per day.. 3. CF arrangement by drag n drop in the swipe in menu - right after we create the CF and set values for it we may need to reorder them. Currently they can't be reordered.. I would like to see another addition...\nLink field - just a normal text field where the imput is link and can be clicked.\nIn our case it will help with organizing working files - the user can make new order, attach the pdf for it but the working files are big sometimes and I wish we can keep them out of the DB.. The markdown is not an option in some cases. If I'm pushing this system to peers that have written everything on hand by now it will be very hard to convince them to learn how to format the URLs...\nIt have to be copy&paste job.. Why do we need name in this field?. One more fix would be if Details field recognizes ftp and http/s links and convert them to URLs. Currently we have to copy/paste from there.\nThen it will be easy, they can write:\nWorking file 1 - http://some_link\nWorking file 2 - http://some_other_link\n. I think this can be fixed with max_width or some URL truncating where the middle part of those nasty long URLs is hidden so the field containing it is displayed in a nice manner.... Hello xet7, thank you for your quick reply!\nNo I mean each new card to receive new unique number so this system can be used as internal tickets system or orders system. This number must be visible in collapsed view next to the name of the card too.\nOur case is:\nWe are shop and we need to manufacture our goods and we need software that can have kanban with different stages of one order and each order must have unique number so we can track them by that.. Also I installed snap with Ubuntu on my virtualbox for testing.\nIs this secure enough for intranet use? I see it does not send out emails which is nice.\nBut I see couple of issues:\n1. There is no settings on normal users - what they can and can not do. So now they can delete the whole kanban, do whatever they want.\n2. The attachments (in our case pdfs) are not displaying in the preview. They download normally.\nThe first one is a stopper for us. I would like to have granulated control so not everybody can stop the company's daily work routine at any time (by mistake or on purpose).\nAlso I can you give me info on how to update the snap release to the latest version?\nSorry for this offtopic!. Thank you for your kind reply!\nWhere I can check the setting of the board? I can only change it's name when clicking on it.\nWhat do you think regarding the numbering of the cards? Can this be implemented in any recent version?. Thank you!\nI saw where those settings are located. Unfortunately 'comment only' is useless in this case because they even can't move the cards across columns.\nThere may be access level as:\n-move, view, comment all cards\n-edit own cards\n-don't add, edit, delete lists, boards, column and swim-line names.\nAt least that. If in future more granular access rights can be implemented where every admin can create groups and rights for those groups based on functionalities of the system this will be great.\nRegarding the card numbering - something like that\n\nSo every new card to get the next number.\n. I'm on 0.76 and latest Chrome and don't have such issue. The shadow is fully visible when scrolling.. Not very important but I am trying to implement wekan in our company so we can keep track of orders and this came up today.\nReally not a stopper but if somebody has time it can be checked. Just wanted to share with the community.. With my profile and my PC I see it as hh.mm and on the rest of computers with their profiles they see it as hh.mm AM/PM.\nAll setups are English (no changes made).\nI'm thinking of making a translation first thing when we implement it in our company but first things first - we need to start so I can have time for the translation.. I've just noticed that you changed the title of my PR.\nI was reporting a bug and just shared my experience. I have a problem where I can't set the proper time in the field. I can't set 15:00 PM I can only set AM hours and I need 1500?\nI'll try switching between UK and US English but I think they are all set on UK.. Can we have settings where we can decide in how many cards to search? And also does it search in archived items?. I have the same issue on snap 0.77. Yesterday it was fine. Today half of the screen is grey. Now I can scroll in the columns but it's useless because I only see 2-3 orders per column.. Please make it at least 900-1000 pixels when there's no swimline.. I have the same issue here with the latest snap release.\nIt would be nice to have the details open in middle of page because we  can have long lists.\nNow I can only scroll if my pointer is over the active card and when it's out of the window I can't scroll up/down.. Open your css and find \"350px\".\nIf it's there you have got the recent PRs here where they tried to fix the columns scroll. Comment or remove and you will have your full height depending on the number of cards per column. The scrolling in each column will not work but it's better.. For me it would be nicer to have it as now (and have focus on the details as now) and only the search results to slide r-l from the sidebar out. But if you want to change it I doubt it will take more than a day to get used to it.\nOne more thing which will be nice will be if we can have the card details swipe over the next columns, not like now to shift them right or left. With one click you can exit the details and you have the same layout as before. Now there's constant shifting of the columns which is not very bad because the shadow is obstructing the attention from this but.... just my 2 cents.. Oh yes of course but I don't mean that.\nI would like the details to swipe over the next column/s.\nSo the active column is visible, the active card is highlighted as of now and there's shadow.\nBut the details when slit out should not slide with them the rest of the columns. They should just overlap the next columns. One fast click as now on the shadow and they close but the rest of the UI don't move.\nNow if we close the card details the columns right of them move left. Which as I said is not very bad because the shadow cover part of this move but if I look for certain card when the shadow is present and need it it will move when I close it and I have to search for it again.\nHope I described it better now!\nKeep the great work on!\nI noticed that you're working on features on cards? Any time-frame on those PRs?. @xet7 https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/807\nCustom fields. I now tried with card archived while ago - it only changes the url and does not fold out.\nWhen I search for item archived today it opens properly. \nCan we search in longer periods of time and how to set that up?. And for some languages (the most of them) it's correct... :) :) :)\nHint: Just translate it the way you want for German.... I think the current font is just fine. It's readable when you zoom in in order to have 5-6 columns visible on cheap screen.\nNo need to change what's not broken. :). It's the same for few versions in snap.... I have the same issue with snap - the copied card link does not open when shared with another member of the board.. Can something similar be implemented in admin section@. We (our company) will definitely need 'delete older than.... days' option because we sometimes need to go back and check or replicate an old order.\nBut fixed option will be fine for us... \n\nolder than 30 days\nolder than 3 months (the perfect scenario for us)\nolder than 6 months\nolder than 365 days..\n\netc.... Today I deleted ~300 cards but the used space of the system didn't reduce. I read that mongodb does not clear the space for the files that are no longer there until we repair the db.\nHow to do that? And firstly - when I delete items from my recycle bin will they delete everything after them effectively freeing up space? Files, options on the cards, etc.. @feuerball11  what do you plan here?. Same here. I have to remind my people to refresh the page when they need the search option. :D. The update won't help you. This is the standard. If you're tagged in the cards try \"Q\" and come here to thank us... :D But you have to be in the board... When I think of it - it will be nice implementation! ;). This 'fix' brings bug with the yellow due date tag. Please address it when you have time. It's not showing anymore, just the red due tag shows now.... Currently the month names can't be translated but the time display is depending on the user browser local settings. If you're US standard you will see them with PM..... For me with 9 core cpu @2 ghz and 8 gb ram barely can handle the load of 10 users and 50 cards in the board and 1000 more in the recycle bin...\nThe usual load is ~1 1 1 but the system have to be restarted daily and sometimes even more.... When you send some card in the bin it simply hides from the board but it's still sitting in the DB. So I doubt there is significant performance gain if any.\nI started deleting old cards that we don't need. For now it's OK but with time if Wekan gets more filtering and search options we might need to keep the cards as order history. For now we use separate system that was in place when I went to this job.. OK but I can't see why you have to implement a broken fix when it's WIP... Please can you revert this in 1.05 and include it again when he's ready?. @rjevnikar  - no I don't use end dates because I don't need them.\nUntil now we used only due date which was highlighting the more urgent orders nicely (sometimes strangely but ...). Now the ones with passed dates are red (as they were before) but those due 2 or less dates are no longer yellow, they stay grey and then turn red when the time passes.\n. So now I have to add both due and end date in order to have them show as before? And both dates must be the same?\nFor me the end date must be fixed only when the actual work is done and then the needed behavior by you must be taken into force. Until the work is done the due date is the important.. At the moment with 1.04 when both due and end dates are set the card shows the end date. So the behavior is correct.\nBut your fix removes the yellow color marking when the card is due shortly.\nIf only this can be fixed it would be nice addition to Wekan! ;)\n. How can I check if this issue is present with our system?. I have the exact same thing here - we can't scroll long cards too.. We have to work now but this evening I'll refresh to 1.31 again and will get back to you with some info. Chrome was hanging and the processor usage was 2.00-3.00 out of 9 cores, node was using 100% if that helps for now.. This night it has updated to 1.33 and everything is working just fine. Thank you.\nThe only error I have now is:\n49d258d47418be89a4842fb9d2386a656f07c288.js?meteor_js_resource=true:163 Uncaught Error: language bg does not exist\n    at Function.e.setLanguage (49d258d47418be89a4842fb9d2386a656f07c288.js?meteor_js_resource=true:163)\n    at 49d258d47418be89a4842fb9d2386a656f07c288.js?meteor_js_resource=true:299\n    at e.Computation._compute (49d258d47418be89a4842fb9d2386a656f07c288.js?meteor_js_resource=true:21)\n    at new e.Computation (49d258d47418be89a4842fb9d2386a656f07c288.js?meteor_js_resource=true:21)\n    at Object.e.autorun (49d258d47418be89a4842fb9d2386a656f07c288.js?meteor_js_resource=true:21)\n    at 49d258d47418be89a4842fb9d2386a656f07c288.js?meteor_js_resource=true:299\n    at a (49d258d47418be89a4842fb9d2386a656f07c288.js?meteor_js_resource=true:1)\n    at HTMLDocument.u (49d258d47418be89a4842fb9d2386a656f07c288.js?meteor_js_resource=true:1)\nBut this is probably because not all strings are translated?!. \n. Can we move if labels after\nif getSpentTime\n.date\n+cardSpentTime\nWouldn't it show them on the same row if only one date is shown in the mini card?. Like very much! :D It will help me create checkboxes very fast!\n. Like!. Like. Does github count my posts? Am I gonna get to the next level soon? :). @bgmnt - you got it right - you have to do it for every card - it's quite useless in this case if you're creating few cards per day...\nAbout your idea of 'done' button - it should at least create popup to confirm the action because it will create cases where incidentally someone move the card and it's gone for good until someone return it from the trash or the other 'trash' dedicated board. Nice idea inho but I would like to see it as follows first:\n\nwhen you move cards to the trash they don't slow down the board - now if I have more than 200 cards there the board slows to the point it does not refresh the card possition on other users, etc.. The loading is very slow too. The fix sugested by @xet7 to create 'Trash' board and move the cards there is great workaround but can the trash be by default a new 'Trash' board whish is accessible by all other boards in terms of searches? So one does not have to go to the trash and return or search there.\neasy search based on all input fields of a card both in the board and in the trash (separatelly or not)\npopup window for this button to confirm action.. @bgmnt I was refering as Trash board - another board called Trash where you move your cards. It's our case now - all cards can go the the current trash but only I move them back and then to the other board called Trash with first column Trash so you can move your cards much the same way between boards as sending them to the bin.\n\nThe issue with this is we have column called Done and we have few cards there. The multiple selection feature does not include moving cards between the boards, only in the current board. So s/o have to manually move every card from the current board to the Trash board..... Yes, this is a must.\nThe roles must be editable so everybody can add or remove roles and each action in the kanban should have settings in this area - from moving cards, to deleting lists, boards, etc. At the moment everybody can do virtually everything with the board, deface and ruin the work of many in the company and even stop work at all.. For me this is the logical order:\n\nreceived - when a bug or task is found\nstart  - when work is started\ndue - when it should be done\nend - when it's done\n\nSo for me the current order is perfect and most logical. We use only due field in our company.. Same here - none of the filters work.. Can you shed more information for this hack and what's causing it?. If I use snap version in local network can it be hacked by that exploit? The server is not visible outside of the network.. Thank you!. Is it production ready? Can we merge in develop?. Thank you @Angtrim ! Your work with this feature is priceless!. @Angtrim - any idea when you will have free time to look into this? :) I'm not pushing you or something simply my female colegues are too fucking lazy to write down few rows of text and they are nagging me wih this.... Sorry once more! Your help is priceless!. Yes, I saw it and it works flawlessly! Big thank you!\nJust another idea that came to me when creating our rules:\nMake (checklist item) in (checklist) if (user name) is added.\nOnce again, big thanks!. No, everything works fine now. But I think it was some sort of 'roundabout' issue because I was trying to make the case work vice-versa. Now I left only the one way option and instructed the people what to do. . For me the calendar view is empty. No cards even that for this week we have 50... :)\nVery strange. I'll test this Monday your finding.. For every card in list [_] MOVE card to board [] by repeating every [__] days\nThis will save me daily work if it can be configured for 2 hours, 3 hours etc.... Do more than 2 cores help? With our snap deploiment I can't see the benefit of more cores.. @xet7 thank you for your comment!\nUnfortunatelly I've been observing those issues many versions ago too. It's very little chance that it's related to this feature because it was introduced few versions ago. We use Wekan like almost an year now and those strange 'movements' were noticed I think last Summer.... I saw that bug also but didn't push further to investigate what is causing the issue. Simply some of the cards are not there but they should be.. ",
    "DejfCold": "[I was redirected here form vanila.io]\n@feuerball11 I was translating strings and got confused about the description of the Advanced Filter ( advanced-filter-description )\n\nYou can change the order by placing brackets. For Example: F1 == V1 and ( F2 == V2 || F2 == V3 )\n\nI'm not sure about whether there should be \"and\" or \"&&\" in the example.\nI asked @xet7 about it in chat. He thinks it's 2 examples. I, on the other hand, think there is a mistake and that there should be \"&&\" instead of the \"and\". Which one is it?\nAlso I noticed, that you have to have spaces around operators and brackets. Do you plan on removing this restriction?. @therampagerado I suppose that if you had a long link, it would clutter the card with it. So I guess it would be better if we did have a name field. @xet7 \nI mean something else. I mean, this would be wekan wide, regardless if you are looking at board A or board B. Something that everyone would see and only admin (the one that can go to admin panel) could edit it. Can't think of a proper example for this, but this could be similar to GitHub's footer except it would be header, editable and instead of \"Contact Github\" there would be \"GitLab\", instead if \"API\" there would be \"Protonmail\", instead if \"Training\" there would be \"Our webapp\" etc . Simply put, there would be links to webapps, the team regularly use. If that makes sense.\nSomething like this, it helps\n\n. ",

It's worth investigating that for sure.. Here's an example of a Taskwarrior task exported in JSON:\n{\"id\":32,\"description\":\"Change from RCurl to httr. See Gitlab issue 1\",\"due\":\"20170318T230000Z\",\"entry\":\"20160916T135831Z\",\"modified\":\"20170208T204202Z\",\"priority\":\"M\",\"project\":\"Dev.abettor\",\"status\":\"pending\",\"uuid\":\"7b78936e-dd3b-43d2-8685-6b7892d35349\",\"urgency\":8.12192}\nItems can be exported individually or as an array. Further details on the Taskwarrior Export page.. @jLouzado Unfortunately I'm not a Meteor developer, so wouldn't be able to code the sync plugin.. Yes, it probably is quite niche as I don't guess many other potential Wekan users are currently using Taskwarrior.\nMy use case is that while Taskwarrior is quite useful as a ToDo list manager, once the number of tasks/project starts to grow I'm finding it a bit overwhelming and would like a more visual approach.\nHaving said that, Taskwarrior has its following and good UIs are few and far between. I like that Taskwarrior syncs between different devices very easily, and I can add/manage my tasks directly from a terminal.\nI've used both Trello, Kanboard and GitLab's Issue Board before, but do like the Wekan UI (I like the Trello UI too, but would prefer an open source self hosted tool).\nIf I was to prioritise my enhancement requests something like #826 or #808 would be top, I'd probably be quite satisfied to take the time and manually copy across my Taskwarrior items into a Wekan instance. Having a quick \"Today\" or \"Next\" list based on Due Date is pretty useful for me, whereas the kanban flow works better when planning ahead.\nTherefore, if this import feature is no feasible right now, I'm happy enough to see it put on hold.. @sonntagd Interesting. The screenshot above was taken from the Wekan version currently running on Sandstorm.io and the language is set to English (I don't think there's an option for UK/US/Australian English variants).\nI've also just installed Wekan on cloudron.io, where yesterday they updated to v0.11.1-rc1 (after I asked them nicely), again with English langauge and the date is still in mm/dd/yyyy format. If I change the language setting within Wekan to Deutsch, I do see dates in dd.m.yyyy format as you do.\nTherefore, I do think defaulting to the ISO data format of yyyy-mm-dd would be a good idea.\n. I think that's a different use case and Wekan should ask if you wish to merge/combine the lists. If answered in the negative, then the lists are differentiated by number. e.g. To Do and To Do 2\n. #808 #826 #864 all deal with aggregating tasks in some form or another. . ",

Dear @xet7 for now, I have already move on by using ubuntu bash on windows 10 which works pretty well and also use less memory rather than using docker or VM-ing. But the problem on curl POST still persist. Does it need specific way to enable this? Hope this year, wekan goes better than before. Currently I use excel 2016. When using curl on ubuntu, is there any necessary path i must take besides getting token? . Yes, still no response.content from vba webresponse. Or could you share some succesfull line ?. \nAbove show my output when I try to post new cards via VBA. I don't know about this, but do we must follow rebuild-wekan.sh for source installation? cause I don't really follow that. Which resulted no .build/bundle directory. From start-wekan.sh I found that we must enter to .build/bundle to enable WITH_API. Or is there any other way simpler? Thank you. . I try to source on Windows, i've done it before, but somehow it needs to be redone, i want to know which dependency are not compatible. I use node 4.8.1 npm 2.5.1 with meteor 1.6.0.1. if you are just interested in wekan only rather than overall ubuntu things, option 2 is more RAM friendly. I have tested it, it is able to add receivedAt via PUT method. So first maybe you can POST your detail (title, description) then add the rest via PUT. Tested using VBA-Web to wekan 1.97. ",

    "GuillaumeAmat": "@xet7 Great thanks!. I'm not a Wekan contributor, as I don't know the code yet, but perhaps it's a javascript bug?\nCan you open your devtools console before trying to create a checklist and see if an error pops up?\nI'm running Wekan by the Docker container as well and it's working like a charm.. Ok so it's really a javascript bug ^^\nOr maybe an auth one? Are you sure you're logged in? What happens if you reload the page?\nAlso, if you want to paste a big trace like yours, it's better to put triple ``` around it (not just one).. It's a duplicate of #828 ;). In fact, you can scroll up/down and left/right but the drag event handlers seem to have the priority.\nSo, to succeed your scroll, you have to find the exact scroll spot in the screen :P \nFor the up/down scroll I use the thin space between the right side of the card and the vertical separator of columns.\nFor the left/right scroll it's... The same actually...\nIt would be better to put some delay before the drag handlers win the deal. In order to let the user scroll quickly or move a thing by keeping pressed on the thing he wants to move.\nThe Trello Android app has a great handling of those cases, in my opinion it can be used as good inspiration source.. Ok I was not aware of the wekanteam/wekan Docker image and still using the mquandalle/wekan one.\nThanks. I'm not a fan of the inner shadows... My eyes are kinda fragiles and it is a lot harder to look at the board with it... Can we discuss about its removal? Or at least propose to disable it in the admin screen?. I saw that but it feels not so open to me...\n\nThanks for your pull request ! But I added that shadow myself, because I like it.\n\nThat's why I ask if a discussion is possible or even an option in the admin.. Thank you @xet7 I highly appreciate that :)\nIMHO, an ideal solution could be to handle themes. It is the only to satisfy all the users needs. But I don't know how difficult it could be to develop it in Wekan.\n. Great idea @gertmenke!. ",

If the project owners can approve it then I can do the necessary \"translation\" quickly. Works for me too.  Page Refresh necessary to change dates formats after you chaneg languages. These fixes are a great improvement but don't fully fix the alignment problems I put in #1497.  I think that the swimlanes header needs to be set to a fixed width in wekan/client/components/swimlanes/swimlanes.styl, e.g. line 42 change \"min-width: 30px;\" to \"width: 40px\".  40 is a minimum, 50 or 60 might be better.  \nIdeal would be to make it editable via the swim lane header menu but that's beyond me.\nto make the dividers more visible I've also done the following, but that's a personal taste issue I think. \n client/components/lists/list.styl\n12 -  border-left: 1px solid darken(white, 20%)\n13 -  border-bottom: 1px solid #CCC\n12  +  border-left: 1px solid darken(white, 40%)\n13 +  border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA\nclient/components/swimlanes/swimlanes.styl\n32 -    border-bottom: 1px solid #CCC\n32 +    border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA. I'm happy with the 30%.\nThe problem I had was that the swimlane headers were adapting their width to the length of the titles and this was throwing out the alignment of all the lists.  see this exaggerated example:\n\nmy hack is to fix the width of the swimlane header - I think including \"min width =\" over-rides the flex properties 0 0 - teh exact width could be different.  I tried to make it an editable variable in the swimlanes action menu but that's beyond me.  My fix does lead to  the possibility of ugly word wrapping:\n\n. could be - I'm using Vivaldi browser which is based on the Chromium engine. This is kind of active already - I have a board which I think was imported from Trello (or perhap wefork) where I had added a card count on one list only and that tracks the changes to the number of cards in the list but I can't see a way to add a count to other lists which didn't have the count added before the import.\n\n. If you change the language to British English the date format changes too\nbut you may need to open and close a board or card for the change to happen.\nOn 16 Aug 2017 3:43 pm, \"Thomas F.

I believe my intention was to go in a slightly different direction then what you mention, although those features would be useful as well. There may be some overlap, or I may just be misunderstanding you. \nHere is what I envision:\nA user currently has the ability to add other registered users to his/her board.\nWhen those users are added, the board owner is currently able to click the users icon and change their permissions.\nCurrently, the only two options are 'Admin' and 'Normal'\nI would like to add a third option: 'Limited' or 'Comment Only' that when set on a user that has been added to the board restricts them from doing anything except opening a card and commenting on it. See the below screenshots. I added erica, and would like to set her to 'Limited'\n\n\nI think this would be a minimally obtrusive feature add and would require less overhead than the implementation you originally suggested.

If you would like to take a look at my current progress, you can see it here: https://github.com/rhelsing/wekan/pull/1/files\nBefore refactoring and making the implementation cleaner, I would like to hear some of your feedback if you have time.\n. @xet7 Is this after running npm test? all tests pass locally for me and on travis.. what did you do to get this error?. @xet7 regarding this https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/925#issuecomment-289122415, I have just submitted a PR to fix: #952 . @vampirefrog I implemented the comment permissions feature but I am fairly new to meteor. I did not experience this issue when testing but I will try to fix it if you give me more details.. If the default level that a user should be at is normal when a user is invited, then isCommentOnly should be set to false instead.. @xet7 would you recommend that I do something like in #970 to resolve this? Except with isCommentOnly? aka set isCommentOnly to false on user create? do I need to create a migration too?. @xet7 see above?. @Jean-Daniel thank you, are there any other spots I may have missed? Is there a callback or modification I can make at a higher level (on the user model maybe?) that would solve all of these potential issues? Something similar to #970 . @brylie would you mind updating the meteor version in the Dockerfile as well? @stephenmoloney does anything else need to be changed in the dockerfile?. @xet7 this should be closed! thx!. @xet7 anything else I need to do on this PR?. @xet7 @ocdtrekkie this all makes sense.

Wanted to gauge the interest in some updated branding. I agree that it should be a complete package if its done. . The cursive version of the typeface can be easily modified (and possibly updated) to resemble the current typeface? . \nI believe all references to 'allowIsBoardMemberNonComment' should be changed to 'allowIsBoardMemberNonCommentOnly' to be more descriptive even though that is a bit more verbose. It could be refactored to 'allowIsBoardMemberCommentOnly' to be cleaner descriptively, but that would require more (possibly bug inducing) changes to the codebase.

In practice, this would mean needing separate Dockerfiles for development and production; possibly separate docker-compose configs as well. I've got a working set of changes for that locally, but before I replace this branch with them, a few questions:\n- Should the default be for development or production?\n- Should scripts be added to package.json for these builds, and/or should we add a Makefile for them? Not doing either is also a valid option.\n- Should the use case of using Docker but not using docker-compose be supported?\nThe EXDEV error looks like a weird thing possibly caused by aufs. I'm not seeing it in my own environment, and it may go away thanks to the further changes I'm making to the docker config.. Sorry, looks like I don't have the time I expected to have to work on Wekan stuff. The \"Allow edits from maintainers\" tag is set on this, so at least @xet7 should have push rights to the source branch in our fork. I'm also ok with someone else starting a new PR based on this, using their own fork.. @xet7 An initial version has now been added to the repo.. @stephenmoloney The problem with using wekan-launchpad for this is that its build and final images need to be re-built for any code changes, the meteor package cache is wiped between re-builds, and there's no automatic tracking of changes to trigger a refresh. In total, that means a total turnaround time of multiple minutes for every code change, rather than the 10 seconds or so I'm seeing with wekan-dev atm.\nOn the other hand, I may also have misunderstood something with your setup. Is there a way to get its refresh time to be of that order as well?. ",

Ok thats a bit hard. You need to check which modules are available in the apache2 instance. \nOne method to check which modules are available, create empty phpfile and add <?php phpinfo() ?> then search for apache2handler. \nIf there are proxy modules avaible you can setup a reserve proxy like @davydov-vyacheslav's workaround.\nThese lines can be added into a .htaccess file too.\nProxyPassMatch   \"^/(sockjs\\/.*\\/websocket)$\" \"ws://127.0.0.1:61199/$1\"\n        ProxyPass        \"/\" \"http://127.0.0.1:61199/\"\n        ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://127.0.0.1:61199/\".

I had a similar issue, i've fixed it with setup smtp over the admin panel. Did you tried this?. Sure you can disable it in the admin panel, after the error you can straight login ^^ wekan doesn't send a verification mail, like xet7 wrote it ^^ You only need to set the user as admin over the mongo cmd.\nBut try to encode your account and password, that was my issue and i got a similar error message.. The Settings work trough the Admin Panel? If yes, encode your account and password it's often the problem inside a smtp-url.. It's sounds like your password or username use some special characters that interrupt the url.  \nMy problem was a @ in the username that caused an error on my instance..

I will ingest your suggested options and go from there.  If I find a solution, I would be happy to add a pull request or add the solution to your documentation.\nThanks for the great project !!. @xet7 Ok, I figured out what I need to do in Keycloak to have the application use keycloak.  Do you mind if I update your wiki directly?\n. @xet7 I updated the page  but I found an issue with the functionality when registering via OIDC.  I added the the issue on the page.  I was wondering if you had any idea why the issue is occuring.\nI register with OIDC.  The user is created with a full name, username, email, initials.\nThe  \"boardView\" item is not being created in the user profile entry in the database.  Any thoughts?. @xet7 Your keycloak link is broken.  I think you meant to use this one: Keycloak.\nLet me know if you need anything else from me. . @xet7 This weekend, I will try to build your app and if I getting it working, if you point me to the working sample code, I can try to get it included.  I haven't done coding in a while but I can give it a shot.\nAs for getting keycloak up and running, I have a docker instance that works.\nAnd instructions are as follows:\nSetup docker & install Keycloak:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/bcgov/queue-management.git\nexport DOCKER_HOST=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375\ncd queue-management/keycloak-local-testserver\nchmod +x *.sh\ndocker build -t keycloak .\ndocker run -it --name keycloak -p 8085:8080 keycloak\n\n\nYou should be able to login in with admin/admin on http://localhost:8085/auth. @xet7 To update the database, couldn't you just update models/users.js line 572 to:\nuser.profile = { initials, fullname: user.services.oidc.fullname, boardView: 'board-view-lists' };\n\nI am having issues building the application locally otherwise I would try that myself :)\nKarim. @xet7 I finally got a local copy running and it seems the following change fixes the issue:\nupdate models/users.js line 572 to:\nuser.profile = { initials, fullname: user.services.oidc.fullname, boardView: 'board-view-lists' };\nProbably not a complete fix as @tiagoefreitas stated, the creation of the boardView should happen independent of if you login in from basic login, LDAP or OIDC.. @danpatdav I had the same issue when setting up Keycloak.  If you are using OIDC, you will need to map the required fields in your Azure OIDC mappings area:\n\nserviceData.id = userinfo.id;\nserviceData.username = userinfo.uid;\nserviceData.fullname = userinfo.displayName;\nserviceData.accessToken = userinfo.accessToken;\nserviceData.expiresAt = expiresAt;\nserviceData.email = userinfo.email;\n\nWhen I did it for keycloak, I documented the mappings I needed to adjust in my keycloak mappings area.\nI am sorry I don't have Azure myself, but from Azure  docs, it looks like you need to re-map quite a few of them.  Good Luck.  \n. @xet7 Pull request submitted to edge for OIDC boardView fix.\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2162\n. @xet7 Sorry about the trailing space that failed the CI tests.  Updated here:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2164\n. @xet7 I built pull request in edge branch & worked like a charm.  How do we get that pushed to the latest release?. @xet7 Thank you!!\n. @danpatdav As I don't have Azure, I can't troubleshoot with you.  I had the same issue but as soon as I added the missing attributes, it all worked.   I recommend you do the following though:\n\nDelete all users from the database\nCreate one user (admin) using the regular registration process.\nCreate yourself via register via OIDC after that.\n\nI think I ran into the same issue as you with the initial user created.  And the above was my workaround. . @xet7 Looks like the recent updates for OIDC (post v11 haha) broke my keycloak instance.  Actually it made it better and easier.  I will re-test and fix the documentation.  I think with the recent mapping additions, it will be much easier to get Keycloak up and running.\nAny chance there is a way to hide the email login and registration from the startup?  Is there an email variable that we can set to FALSE?. @xet7 I updated the wiki for keycloak.  Thanks to the newer OAUTH2 commit (bdbbb12f967f7e4f605e6c3310290180f6c8c6d1) , the setup for keycloak is much simpler.  . @xet7 The v2.24 image broke OAUTH2 for Keycloak with this error:\nUncaught TypeError: a.join is not a function\n    at Object.requestCredential (a33a650939723c9124573489e1dd465fe973fdc8.js?meteor_js_resource=true:175)\n    at e.isClient.e.loginWithOidc (a33a650939723c9124573489e1dd465fe973fdc8.js?meteor_js_resource=true:177)\n    at Object.click button (a33a650939723c9124573489e1dd465fe973fdc8.js?meteor_js_resource=true:155)\n    at a33a650939723c9124573489e1dd465fe973fdc8.js?meteor_js_resource=true:59\n    at Function.e._withTemplateInstanceFunc (a33a650939723c9124573489e1dd465fe973fdc8.js?meteor_js_resource=true:59)\n    at f.View.

The whole pb is that after receiving his invitation code he can't register with it and get \"Unknown error\" on the register panel.

I moved to the last docker image, now the wekan app logs nothing when I send a mail. \nThe mails are delivered sometimes and rejected some other times with the postfix logs \"Mail content rejected in reply to End Of Data command\".. I moved to the last docker image, now the wekan app logs nothing when I send a mail. \nThe mails are delivered sometimes and rejected some other times with the postfix logs \"Mail content rejected in reply to End Of Data command\".. No the SMTP relay server is the one rejecting the mails. The weird part is that before changing the sender adress from wekan2@ourdomain.com to wekan@ourdomain.com the mails were being correctly delivered.. Yes they're the same and no setting back the first email used didn't fix the problem. \nAnd to have the mail changing take effect, a restart isn't enough, I have to remove and recreate the containers with docker-compose down and up again, but that's just information.. Okay I did, still the same:\nPostfix logs: \nJun 20 11:48:37 dockerhost postfix/qmgr[1636]: 2977311F77A4: from=wekan2@ourdomain.com, size=564, nrcpt=1 (queue active)\nJun 20 11:48:37 dockerhost postfix/smtp[11721]: 2977311F77A4: to=mymail@ourdomain.com, relay=smtp.ourdomain.com[X.X.X.X]:25, delay=0.16, delays=0.06/0.01/0.03/0.06, dsn=5.7.1, status=bounced (host smtp.ourdomain.com[X.X.X.X] said: 550 5.7.1 Message content rejected (in reply to end of DATA command))\nWekan app logs nothing. . About the spam filtering it's possible, I contacted the postmaster of our smtp.ourdomain.com without getting answer. But the mails used to be delivered, unless they changed their policy in the meantime. \nWe use french, yes I did a wireshark capture of the mail and compared it to when I send the mail manually with netcat (in that case the mail is delivered, with the same mail content, sender and receiver addresses), the two captures look alike except that wekan uses ESMTP protocol to send the mail while with netcat it's SMTP.

(so you configure wekan to use smtp://127.0.0.1:25/  - without tls and it is still connecting with tls?)\nif this is the case -  there still remains the issue that wekan tries to send with tls even if it is told to use cleartext smtp. \ni run into issues using the snap implementation (and not docker). \nor is my understanding wrong?\nshould i open a seperate issue?. i just found something in the meteor email pagkage implementation. it seems they added STARTTLS support for the email package: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/8637.\ntheory:\nso in my case i try to send to a mail relay which was contacted without a STARTTLS header before. Now with the recent package it does STARTTLS. The problem seems to be that the certificate from the mail relay presented when using  STARTTLS is untrusted/unknown in the linux system (or maybe it has to be trusted within the snap). i try to search if this theory is right and i can get it working by adding the certificates. i couldn't find a way to disable STARTTLS for the meteor email package.. ok - so my ubuntu server had the certificates already in the store and a \nopenssl s_client -starttls smtp -crlf -connect internalmailrelay::25\nshowed that everything should be fine.\nunfortunately if i switch the shell into the context of the snap via\nsnap run --shell wekan-ondra.help\ni cant use openssl there to test if everything is working - snap is blocking this system calls.\non futher search i found out that snap itself changed the behavior and is no longer using the certificate auth store now but an internal one for snap: https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/pull/3271\nif found no possiblity to configure this internal store so far - but I'll try to dig deeper in the rabbit hole tomorrow ;-). @kubiko - thanks for your help. \nwith the network enabled shell i could verify that indeed this is the issue. the snap can't verify the certificate - although the server can:\nsnap\nverify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate\nserver\nverify return:1\nsnapd is only using the ca-certifictes under \n/snap/core/current/etc/ssl/certs\nthis directories are read only - so you can't add anything to it.\nsetting a user and password didn't help for me \nI set \nMAIL_URL='smtp://foo:bar@internalmailrelay:25/'\nand restarted wekan. on the next test mail i still get the same error.\ni can't find any currently supported way to add certificates to the snap but i found a discussion concerning this issue:\nhttps://forum.snapcraft.io/t/extending-system-certificates/114/12\nso basically there is currently no option to disable ssl as meteor is always using STARTTLS if the server is supporting it.\nand there is no supported option to configure snapd in a way that is uses the sytem cert store - as it was the case with older builds.\nso you are stuck to public ca's already in the ca store of snap currently it seems.\nhas anyone an idea for a clever workaround?\n. as a dirty workaround we configured dedicated smtp connectors for the wekan server which are not offering STARTTLS. this solved the problem for my installation.\ni think this problem will still bite every snap user with an internal mail relay which is offering starttls or enforcing tls. and it is especially nasty to troubleshoot if you configure smtp without TLS and the meteor email provider is using it anyways. \nso a better solution to the problem should be found.\n.

    "memeplex": "I would add here that the triple top bar (for example, chrome, then sandstorm, then wekan) makes the app barely usable in a small screen. One can remove sandstorm at the expense of self hosting wekan, but the browser bar is only removable by running as standalone web app.. Not sure but that seems to implement the ability to share from the web app, not to it. AFAIK the app wanting to receive share intents must state so in its manifest, so I don't think an in-browser app would ever be able to do that since it doesn't own a manifest. It's probable that tasker or automagic could accept share intents and forward them to wekan using the api. Or a sharing widget (also using the api) could be coded for android as an optional complement to the web app.. I understand your concern, I'm just saying that sharing to wekan would require some component outside the web ui, but this component can be implemented as a workflow for tasker/automagic or as a native mini-app, thus reducing to a minimum the impact over your decision to keep everything in-browser. . Regarding the manifest, I don't know what is this about https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1184, but maybe it's possible to include a manifest for the web app, isn't it?. It would still be necessary to register some kind of handler and I'm not seeing how to do that in the  resource you linked above.\nI'm going to try to create an automagic workflow and let you know of the result. It shouldn't be that hard.. I've been thinking about this and realized that the ability to send an email to create a card, as in Trello, would be enough since share intents can then be sent to the email app. But I'm not sure whether wekan already support card creation by email..

But something we are using today in the Excel and paper board is missing in all known kanban web boards. I just explain how we use the boards:\nEach Project (or several similar Projects) have their own board. They plan development tasks with a lengt of 1-4 weeks. Each development task creates a swimline on the board with subtaks (should be around one day of work). The subtasks are then moved from \"backlog\" to \"in progress\" to \"in review\" and finally to \"done\". \nWhat we need now is the possibility to add some Attibutes to the Swimline. At least the following attributes are needed:\n\nTask or Incident number (would be good to create a link)\nTitle of the Task or Incident\nResponsible user(s)\nPlanned Effort (orignial estimation)\nPlanned Effort (actual estimation)\nStart date\nEnd date\n\nThe best would be to add the possibility to define custom optional attributes for the swimlines. This would fullfill everyones requirements by configuration. . BTW you all do a great job here. There is so much flow in this project. I'm still impressed ...\nBack to my idea to have attributes for the swimline. I assume something similar to this:\n\nThe first line is the so called identifier for the swimline. This means in our case a development task in a life cycle management tool. I have now decided to install wekan in the latest version in our environment and will use it as shown in the print screen above.

    "Digital-Thor": "Thanks for posting your solution @timt!  I was having the same problem.. I'm trying to learn about Winston.  It looks like it was merged and I think it's supposed to be in server/logger.js, but I don't see that file in wekan/wekan.   Was it removed due to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1094?. For visualization purposes, I coded some front-end changes to show how the Automation solution might be implemented.  As an example of tracking Card Due Dates, I used a board that tracks aging account-receivables.  It shows a new Automation swimlane and an Add Automation button.  \n\nClicking the Add Automation button would bring up a Butler-style Trigger-Actions wizard as shown below.  Some of the details are unique to our application so ignore the details such as the wording change of \"Card\" to \"Case\", the actual actions in the Does column.  The general concept would be that the automation would run when cards hit the date configured in the List heading.  \nA general solution would probably only include sending emails.  A more advanced approach could enable HTTP calls to be configured elsewhere and listed as actions in the Does column.\n\n. Lots to think about.  \nYes, I think it might be good to enable some user-configuration of the board's vocabulary (which wouldn't need to be translated).  For instance \"case\" works for the example I gave, but someone may just want to call it \"invoice\".   Or who knows what someone might be tracking.  What about if someone set up a board to track vehicles, it might be easier for them to think about cards as \"vehicles\".\nButler uses a vertical column for automation along with a 'Butler' user.  I hadn't seen their approach when I coded my mock up and horizontal automation, configurable by column, made more sense to me.  Nevertheless, since then, I received some further feedback that compound triggers may be needed.  For instance, the value of the invoice and the time it's overdue may require different actions to be triggered.  So perhaps the triggers should be configured at a board level rather than the (vertical) list, but permit triggers based on variables within the card, system time, or.... Flugo has a nice GUI.  I'm going through their docs now.  I guess the downside is that not all Wekan JS developers can jump into the GO codebase.  Would the proposed integration only work in Sandstorm?\nI've been using Node-Red for home automation and have been very impressed with it.  I notice that it has a rules engine.    It also has over 2000 integrations (flows) and is a project of the JS Foundation.\nThere's also the Drools rules engine which works with KIE BPM and supported by Red Hat.\nThen there are quite a few others, including:\n\nBehive\nDurable Rules\nRule Reactor (JS)\n\nRegarding the issue about custom terms, I meant that perhaps we could have a board-level setting (not swimlane-level setting) for the term to use instead of \"card\".  For my demo, I changed all appearances of \"card\" in en.i18n.js to \"case\".  Not an urgent feature request, just a side thought.  I will move that to the feature request area.\n. ",
    "Fran-KTA": "Same here. If you leave the board in \"Muted\" state, even having set both user preferences \"notify-watch\" and \"notify-participate\", there are no notifications about activity on cards marked as watched.\nSetting the board for \"Watching\" or \"Tracking\" sends notifications, but not with the desired granularity (watched card level).\nOn the other hand, Edits of description or custom fields don't get notified, just comments or card movements. I'd guess this is by design, though.\nCentOS 7 + Docker (from distro repos): WeKan 1.02, MongoDB 3.2.20, NGinx (SSL rev proxy). Also noticed that.\nDocker: mongo 3.2.20, wekan 1.02, nginx(rev-proxy SSL). FWIW, I faced the described behaviour today as I decided to update our wekan deployment, but it only seemed to affect one board (not a clue about any possible reason).\nThing is... I kind of remember the board showing up perfectly fine soon after upgrading the docker container to v1.04 image, but it must have stopped working at some point (couldn't say to which action might that be associated, was shifting from cockpit-ws created containers to docker-compose and learning docker-compose.yml at the same time, so multiple regenerations, stops, starts, etc). \nTried investigating, but no suspicious message was to be found on either mongodb, wekan or nginx (reverse proxy) logs.\nAlso, changing docker-compose definition for using v1.03 triggered container regeneration and the board was accessible without issue while going back to latest rendered the board inaccessible (later on pulled v1.04 and removed the image tagged with \"latest\", but that behaviour persisted going back and forth between v1.03 and v1.04)\nTried going to v1.03, exporting board and importing back in v1.04... The process showed me a \"400\" string in a pale yellow box at the end and the result was that I had 4 copies of the board (and of every card).\nFinally, dropped the wekan database from mongodb and did a mongorestore from a backup I took before starting the conversion + upgrade and the board works in v1.04 again... \nHmm... Quite a long post for a \"my 2 cents\" idea in the end... sry.\nCheers!. Hi @xet7! Indeed, backups can (and will) save your as* for sure :)\nHowever, the thing that bothers me most is the consistency in results when switching to v1.03 and back. Including, of course, standard procedures in-between like browser data/cache/cookies cleanup, forced cache refreshes and trying at least two different browsers... Couldn't access the board in 1.04 no matter what (neither from other board members' computers).\nBtw, one extra detail is that I had switched the board's background color to black and that was changing ok. It seemed to me that, somehow, what was not happening was the transition from the loading animation to the board view. Again, due to the lack of seemingly relevant error messages in any container log and no debug messages from wekan that I could find.\nOn the database side of things... No error was shown in the logs and I accessed the boards and cards collections from the host without any problems (I verified the number of copies of the board and one specific card when I tried the v1.03 import on v1.04). \nOh!! The imported copies were accessible in v1.04! That I forgot to mention before, sry. I dropped and restored the database as a fast cleanup from that mess.\nIn any case, since I decided to stay in v1.04 I'll come back if the issue shows up again.\nCheers!. Hi! I just remembered I had taken a cold file backup of my database, so reconfigured the MongoDB container for using that copy and the issue was there!! \nThen I got the database back to functional one and wekan container back to v1.03 for JSON exporting the board for file comparison.\nWith vimdiff I found just activity differences... Different dateLastActivity values, etc. And some little differences regarding added attributes to docs in the non-functional database export (so, yes, that board seemed to be ok for some time after initial upgrade).\nIn particular, there was a card that had \"receivedAt\" attribute added and it turns out that when I repeated the action the board was inaccessible again!! So, tried dropping the attribute from mongo and the board came back!\n\ndb.cards.update({\"_id\":\"AKcaMDhXCDS8zrkHu\"},{ $unset: { \"receivedAt\": \"\" } })\nWriteResult({ \"nMatched\" : 1, \"nUpserted\" : 0, \"nModified\" : 1 })\n\nTried different date (next day) with same result. However... There are already 2 cards in that board with that attribute set and no problems. Also, created a specific test card and moved it around lists, swimlanes, etc. Didn't seem to reproduce the behaviour... But added receivedAt attribute and there it was (again, removal from database restored board access).\nAdd and remove receivedDate without trying to reload the board inbetween does not affect operations like moving cards, etc. So, it may not be related to the update action but the retrieval??\nAnd, last thing... Adding a receivedDate AND an endAt attributes to the same card seems to avoid the behaviour.\nSo... My guess is that any board with cards having received date and no other date set may be the ones failing to load?? At least in my standalone, docker-based deployment.\nCheers!\nEDIT1:  Adding a card to the Welcome Board (empty) + adding receivedAt to that card makes Welcome Board not showing just like the first one. So, not board specific.\nEDIT2: Maybe a typo (?) in this commit? https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1685/commits/ca51ace22d6f5097a8d0dbf9a62e7248cce1c4a3 (Line 18, miniCardReceivedDate instead on minicardReceivedDate, don't know if there's case sensitivity).\nEDIT3: This fixed the issue for me it would seem... Now I can set ReceivedDate and keep access to the board:  docker exec wekan-app sed -i s/miniCardReceivedDate/minicardReceivedDate/g build/programs/web.browser/b2c227c2b857cb03b0726b1154895841e5c27917.js. Same here :)\nv1.05 suffers from the same (tried both), so I went back to v1.04 + manual fix.\nDid some tests... and it would seem to me that a lot more exceptions show up in browser console for 1.05 and, in particular, this comes from accessing the board that doesn't show up (and the others don't throw this one AFAIK):\nException from Tracker recompute function:\n8833bc7d825b6ddb52d7912570a5f00bac83cb78.js:1:6261\nError: cannot call methods on draggable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'\n8833bc7d825b6ddb52d7912570a5f00bac83cb78.js:1:6261\nI tried disabling the \"show on minicard\" toggle for custom fields via database, but didn't work.\nCheers!.

Cheers! . Hi! Managed some minutes for a pending test.\nDuplicated the database and connected the wekanapp test container to a new dbtest container. \nSince I tried to move the board to recycle bin (worked) and delete (this doesn't, though) without success, I manually deleted the board, cards, checklists, checklistitems, comments, customfields, etc. from the database.\nExported the board from real DB on v1.04 and imported the JSON on v1.07-test. The process ended with that \"400\" on a yellow box and the board was triplicated, but all three copies of the board are accessible.\n:-/\nThanks! Cheers!. Sure, just saw that while going through these little tests.\nNow... I noticed something on the imported copies of the board, the customFields were stripped from the board and their references from the cards.\nWent back to initial test-db state and deleted customFields. Board was still not accessible, updated all cards from that board with $unset: {customFields:\"\"} and board showed up on v1.07.\nFinally... After going back in db state, I found out there were 4 cards which referenced a non-existing custom field. A first version of a dropdown type custom field that was deleted and replaced at early stages of the board's life, most probably.\n```\n\ndb.cards.find({boardId:\"qKWyrbASWkthj3pWo\",\"customFields._id\":\"LMsLX4pQxwkMnjQPZ\"},{customFields:1})\n{ \"_id\" : \"84K7gKGhkEJ2mAzqR\", \"customFields\" : [ { \"_id\" : \"LMsLX4pQxwkMnjQPZ\", \"value\" : \"QLrWPk\" }, { \"_id\" : \"ktY8vDRMxj2Yezo4o\", \"value\" : \"WpJQtE\" } ] }\n{ \"_id\" : \"3KMfHrQQRxBttsqDt\", \"customFields\" : [ { \"_id\" : \"LMsLX4pQxwkMnjQPZ\", \"value\" : \"QLrWPk\" }, { \"_id\" : \"ktY8vDRMxj2Yezo4o\", \"value\" : \"WpJQtE\" }, { \"_id\" : \"vPraAAx9fEWpqzq2Y\", \"value\" : 15 } ] }\n{ \"_id\" : \"6z9dahsMLZanbxK32\", \"customFields\" : [ { \"_id\" : \"LMsLX4pQxwkMnjQPZ\", \"value\" : \"QLrWPk\" }, { \"_id\" : \"ktY8vDRMxj2Yezo4o\", \"value\" : \"WpJQtE\" }, { \"_id\" : \"vPraAAx9fEWpqzq2Y\", \"value\" : 60 } ] }\n{ \"_id\" : \"pkRnyqs3RMdz5YzWa\", \"customFields\" : [ { \"_id\" : \"LMsLX4pQxwkMnjQPZ\", \"value\" : \"QLrWPk\" } ] }\ndb.customFields.find()\n{ \"_id\" : \"vPraAAx9fEWpqzq2Y\", \"boardId\" : \"qKWyrbASWkthj3pWo\", \"name\" : \"Time Spent (minutes)\", \"type\" : \"number\", \"settings\" : {  }, \"showOnCard\" : true }\n{ \"_id\" : \"ktY8vDRMxj2Yezo4o\", \"boardId\" : \"qKWyrbASWkthj3pWo\", \"name\" : \"Requestor\", \"type\" : \"dropdown\", \"settings\" : { \"dropdownItems\" : [  ] }, \"showOnCard\" : false }\n```\nSo dropped those references and, happily, board shows up in v1.07.\n\ndb.cards.updateMany({boardId:\"qKWyrbASWkthj3pWo\",\"customFields._id\":\"LMsLX4pQxwkMnjQPZ\"},{$unset:{customFields:{ \"_id\" : \"LMsLX4pQxwkMnjQPZ\", \"value\" : \"QLrWPk\"} } })\n{ \"acknowledged\" : true, \"matchedCount\" : 4, \"modifiedCount\" : 4 }\nThanks! Cheers!\nEDIT: For checking this particular situation this should work (from mongoshell):\ncustf=db.customFields.find().map(function(a){return a._id;})\ndb.cards.find({\"customFields\":{\"$elemMatch\": {\"_id\":{\"$nin\":custf}}}},{\"boardId\":1,\"title\":1,\"customFields\":1}). Hi!\nSorry, @zypA13510, db.collection.updateMany() is MongoDB 3.20 onwards and your version may be older.\nIn that case, please, try:\ndb.cards.update( { boardId:\"_________________\",\"customFields._id\":\"_________________\" } , { $unset:{customFields:{ \"_id\" : \"_________________\", \"value\" : \"______\"}  }  } , { \"multi\":true } )\nCheers!. Hi,\nYou could try to create the index and see... If it doesn't help you could just leave it there or drop it. \n\ndb.checklistItems.createIndex({\"cardId\":1})\n{\n        \"createdCollectionAutomatically\" : false,\n        \"numIndexesBefore\" : 2,\n        \"numIndexesAfter\" : 3,\n        \"ok\" : 1\n}\n\nKeep in mind, though, that index creation will block database operations if launched in foreground (resource impacts go for very large collections it would seem). Non blocking (background) creation:\n\ndb.checklistItems.createIndex({\"cardId\":1},{\"background\":true})\n\nAnd index deletion:\n\ndb.checklistItems.dropIndex({\"cardId\":1})\n{ \"nIndexesWas\" : 3, \"ok\" : 1 }\n\nCheers!. Hi @sjoki, \nThis would be related to issue #1703 I think...\nCheers!. ",

    "mayjs": "As a quick follow up: Maybe it would be better to use a more sophisticated library for handling the REST API. restivus seems to allow to easily create an authentication endpoint for password authentication. It also seems to allow for a pretty quick integration of a simple REST-API offering good functionality.. Alright, #1033 fixes the vulnerabilities described here, so I will close this issue.. Okay, I will start to add to the API once I have the time to do it. Here is a list of endpoints and features I'm planning to add to the existing API:\n\n[x] The current authorization is fine to protect a wekan instance, but to restrictive for my uses. Every user should be allowed to use the API, but an authorization system must be used to restrict the access to certain objects.\n[x] Add GET /api/user/boards, this endpoint should return all boards the user is part of. (Instead of /api/user/boards we could also extend the functionality of GET /api/boards)\n[x] Change GET /api/boards/:id to be usable by users who are able to access it\n[x] Change GET /api/boards/:boardId/lists to be usable by anyone who has access to the board\n[x] Change GET /api/boards/:boardId/lists/:listId/cards to be usable by users who can access the board\n[x] PUT /api/boards/:boardId/lists/:listId/cards/:cardId to update existing cards\n[ ] We could create an endpoint to return cards using a filter. (E.g. get all cards that are in the leftmost list or have a certain tag etc.) This feature could allow a client to get all cards to be done by the logged in user without requesting all cards on all boards first. This would require some specification before implementation, to see how the query format should look etc.\n[ ] Maybe create special admin endpoints, e.g. to get every board. Some of these endpoints already exist, like POST /api/users.\n[ ] Maybe change POST /api/boards and DELETE /api/boards/:id\n[ ] Managing labels\n[ ] Assigning labels to cards (by extending POST /api/boards/:boardId/lists/:listId/cards)\n[ ] Change the remaining admin-only endpoints\n[x] Better error output. Currently HTML gets returned if some parameter was wrong\n\nNOTICE: The checkmarks in this list checkmarks do not necessarily indicate that the feature was already merged into this repository. The features are developed in my fork and will be merged in bigger sets.\nIf anyone would like to discuss these features or add new ideas to this list, feel free to comment.. I added label management to the todo list. The assignment to existing cards can be handled in the card updating endpoint.. I changed the Update endpoint to PUT.\nFor the filtering endpoint I was actually planning on some type of JSON query format, which is why I chose POST for it. I also was thinking about more than just simply searching for a name, which is why I did not want to use GET-parameters. But I get your point, we should use a GET-request because this endpoint does not add data to the database. On the other hand I am also not fond of passing JSON via GET.\nI will change the text of the filtering feature to a more general description of the feature, I think a specification of what exactly should be possible with this feature is needed before deciding how to implement it.. @mass3y first of all, the page you linked is of a different project which has readonly access. The integrated Wekan API does currently not have documentation like that.\nFor authentication and authorization, please see #1033. That PR contains a description on how to get tokens to use the API.. Thanks for the information about the bug in GET /api/users/:userid/boards. It is an error in the current implementation, where the wrong parameter is used for getting the boards. Issue #1118 will be used for tracking this issue.\nThe authentication part we currently use was implemented by @huneau, as far as I know he intended login only via username and not with email address.. I cannot test this right now, but in theory the endpoint should work. @Krantz-Man you have to be authenticated with an admin account. This is the structure to be used for the post data:\n{\n  title: \"your card title\",\n  description: \"your description\",\n  authorId: \"userid of the author\"\n}\nIf one of these parameters is missing, an internal server error will occur.\nI will soon have time to modify data modifying endpoints like this one to be usable by non-admin users.. @huneau thanks for your feedback. You are right, it would be better to use GET /api/users/:userId/boards. I will fix this issue and add it to this PR.\nI am also not very happy with GET /api/user, but to use the API, you must be able to get your own userId.. Oh yeah you are right. It's fixed.. @huneau Are you still active on this project?\n@xet7 any idea how we can set the current user in the REST-API in order to get this fixed? I am kind of stuck on this right now.. @xet7 It did not exist before this PR.. This PR does not really fix the issue. While it does make sure to add the author as a member, the activity for the creation of the card is still wrong. I think this happens because of this code:\nCards.after.update((userId, doc, fieldNames) => {\n    if (_.contains(fieldNames, 'archived')) {\n      if (doc.archived) {\n        Activities.insert({\n          userId,\n          activityType: 'archivedCard',\n          boardId: doc.boardId,\n          listId: doc.listId,\n          cardId: doc._id,\n        });\n      } else {\n        Activities.insert({\n          userId,\n          activityType: 'restoredCard',\n          boardId: doc.boardId,\n          listId: doc.listId,\n          cardId: doc._id,\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  });\nThe userId parameter seems to be invalid since we do not really have a logged in user when using the REST-API, so the activity ends up getting a wrong userId (I think it is 0). The resulting activity is shown in the screenshot in #1045.. If you don't find a solution for this problem, we could also try what happens if we use restivus. I think this issue would not occur when using this library, haven't tried it though.. So, I have looked into the issue, and it does not seem like restivus works better on this.\nAnd there is actually a good reason for it: the hooks are not a default part of meteor, but a library called meteor-collection-hooks. Luckily the readme of that library contains information on what to do if this issue occurs. The recommended way is to set CollectionHooks.defaultUserId to the correct userId. I'm not sure how this would interact with simultaneous requests though (If there is multithreading in meteor). Another way could be to use Direct access to prevent the hooks from running. We could then move all hooks into separate functions and just call them manually from the REST-API.\nAlso, restivus does a pretty good job of defining the API, one part I like about it is that the integrated authentication works pretty good and there is an easy way to provide different API versions. But I don't think the benefits are enough to make the switch from our existing API. If you want to have a look at what I did, take a look at https://github.com/mayjs/wekan/commit/98dfbbf368bedf46bf7577b5c749507c4271633e and https://github.com/mayjs/wekan/commit/71f274dfa39931c6fa56169310342e8b90f98c57 for a usage example.. Isn't the author of the card set in the object that is inserted into the collection? I think this line of code is responsible for that. The hook I quoted above is for inserting the activity for the card creation, which fails with the current code (and also the code of your PR).\nIf we use the direct access method, we can insert objects into collections without running the hooks. This would lead to non created activities if, for example, a card is created with the API. If we call the hook manually, this problem would be gone.. Thats what I meant. If you extract the Activity insertion into a function and replace the hook function (the Cards.after.update) part with a reference to that function, the code is a bit cleaner and we do not have the same code at two locations.. According to the documentation, doc should be the object that was added to the collection. For the POST endpoint of cards you should be able to do something like const card = Cards.findOne({_id: id}); to get the card that was previously created using Cards.insert, since the insert function returns the new id.. Looks good to me, haven't tested it though. I assume you tested all endpoints to work properly? Thanks for your work, I think I'll be able to progress on #1037 once this was merged.. Isn't this something that could be added using an external tool accessing the REST-API?. It seems like we do currently not delete activities and other objects which are associated with the current user.\nAfaik, there is no way to delete a user via GUI, which is why this issue did never occur before. I would suggest to add some logic to check if an user exists, and display an appropriate text instead of the username in case it does not.. @ocdtrekkie that is true, your way would basically only require a variable for every user to mark if it was deleted.\nThe problem is that we could now have Wekan instances where users were deleted, so I would say the check before displaying the user is required either way.. There was an issue caused by hooks not getting the correct userId at some point. The first time we noticed it while working on the API was at #1045, which was worked around by @zarnifoulette in #1116.\nHis workaround was to use direct insertion into the collection, so that the hooks would not be called. The hook actions are then executed manually.\nIf we created functions for all hooks, we could just use these functions from the REST-endpoints without having them run the hooks.\nThis solution is not very elegant, but if it is implemented carefully would solve this issue. I think the defaultUserId option might cause race conditions or similar issues, if for example two REST-API calls arrive and the hooks for the first call are executed after the second call was processed.. Yes, I think this is currently the only really working solution.. ",

Should be easy so will probably add a commit this week.\nOne nasty thing is importing a board with subtasks in another board.\nIs it OK to create boards when importing boards? #sandstorm\nSub-boards and Sandstorm\nWith regards to @xet7 comment about sub-boards: I forgot to mention that - if a default board is not set - when the user adds a subtasks a new board is created. This is fine in plain implementation but sandstorm only works with one board. Possible solutions:\n\nin sandstorm the board is always its own default board => cards will be deposited in same board\nI don't think that there is anything preventing the database in sandstorm to have multiple boards, it's just a gui problem. So create new board to be used as default board for new tasks in main board and add a way to switch between main tasks and subtasks. Either:\nlimit the nesting level to 1 (subtasks cannot have their own subtasks) or \ndo something smarter like allowing multiple boards (significant change, probably). \n\n\n\nLinked cards #1592\nI suggest changing type to linkType in models/cards.js\nOnce implemented code needs to be added to take subtasks into consideration as linked data.\nOther than that I see no reason for concern.. Right now I see a strange bug: parent is not shown if you do not click first on the board where the parent belongs. This means that I fail to understand some internal logic.\nOne thing that I want to add is ability to show archived tasks as checked, with those not archived being unchecked.\nFYI I implemented this feature because I need it for my business, I use it daily and looks good, except previously mentioned quirks.. Thanks for testing & reporting.\nWill look into that. The two parts should be independent; \"deposit subtasks\" regards only future actions and should change nothing about existing cards.\nI have no preference of \"deposit\" over \"save\". If others don't have any issue with that I suggest a PR.. @xet7 uses start and end to display the card as an interval and shows the title of the card at this point. \nA link to the card is inserted but does nothing because the code does not know to switch to another view.\nAn easy next step is type use the card detail template to show cardDetail in a popup when the user clicks a card.\nThen changing default view to our minicard would be nice.\nCards that only have start or end should be presented at that time with a 1 hour duration.\nCards that have no time info should be presented in a separate side list so that the user can drag them into place.. Also, it would be possible to show same card more than once:\n\nonce if there is a received time with a distinct color\nonce the start-end interval\nfinally if there is a due date => short event in another distinctive color.\n\nThe alternative is two intervals: start-end and received-due but I would guess it becomes unreadable pretty fast.. 1. Colors: I see two issues here: \n    1. the color of the card: this is something we should have in wekan independently of the calendar feature; the calendar implementation should only inherit it; \n    2. the labels: the logical approach for this would be some refactoring of the minicard code but - as I said elsewhere - the code is not very well isolated. Of course that simply showing a blue rectangle is underwhelming.\n\n\nclicking on the card should show card details with current implementation in #1752\n\n\nHaving a separate button is not a problem if there's a consensus.\n\n\nWould appreciate some feedback about the way the four (4) distinct dates of a card should be presented in the calendar. TBH I do not use this feature right now in my implementation.\n\n\n@lichtamberg Right now we use start and end date. Please see #1752; if it still doesn't work please export the board and post it here.. @lichtamberg due field was filled in; please enter a date in end. @lichtamberg And how long would each entry be, time wise? 1 hour? 1/2 hour?. Hey, everybody. Sorry for being slow with the replies.\nIt was and are quite busy at work and I don't have much time to implement changes.\nThat being said the changes are coming and my personal opinion is that we will implement as many combinations as possible and those should be governed by settings.\nSo if you have any other thoughts about the calendar feature, please add them here.\nHowever, right now my efforts regarding wekan are directed toward converting the entire code base into using modules and imports/exports so that we can also have tests and we can use wekan as a package.\nI hope this is something the community can get behind. \n@xet7 what do you think?. @d3dbit I must say it's not entirely clear to me the distinction between the four values.\nIMHO the user should be able to choose - for any particular board - the content of the cards, including which dates are shown and how, checkboxes, subtasks, description, and everything else.. @xet7 please have a look here\nMost of the server side code was moved into imports\nEdit: the code does not work right now, so don't bother testing it. It's work in progress. It is just meant to show the layout that I have in mind. Once it is running the ReadMes in each directory will be updated.. @d3dbit my interest in wekan is a bit more selfish. It is not the eternal glory of the project. :grin: \nShoudn't take too long.\n. Sorry, quite busy at work. Will do when there's time if nobody else steps up.. ~~If the message is  user moved board/card/list/swimlane name then shouldn't the message be:~~\n~~__user__ moved __board__ to Recycle Bin~~\n~~with corresponding changes in code? ~~\n~~Maybe in some languages it does not makes sense to have the username as the very first thing in the message.~~\nRight. I see that it's not trivial to change as I thought at first.. Is this line doing what i think it does? @andresmanelli\nconst integrations = Integrations.find({ boardId: board._id, type: 'outgoing-webhooks', enabled: true, activities: { '$in': [description, 'all'] } }).fetch();\n'cause that's not right.\nAnd by that I mean that the description is:\n// serviceName -> callback(user, title, description, params)\n// expected arguments to callback:\n// - user: Meteor user object\n// - title: String, TAPi18n key\n// - description, String, TAPi18n key\n// - params: Object, values extracted from context, to used for above two TAPi18n keys\n//   see example call to Notifications.notify() in models/activities.js\nSo the description can also be a plain string, which may not be in English => false negative.\nThe description may also contain the text all but not be intended for all => false positive.\n@xet7 . Will correct the issues with code quality in a new commit.. Thank you for the feedback.\nSadly, this is not going as good as I wanted, mostly because I can't seem to be able to isolate the code for unit tests.\nAt some point I will have enough time to propose some changes in the structure of the code, including using imports. This will have some added benefits, like being able to use wekan as a package.\nUntil then I put this initiative on hold.. @neverwet Using devel? Or master?.

Hey, @Akuket .\nPlease open a separate issue for your question so others with same problem can find it easier.\n\nThanks.. @biji @xet7 I think that we can close this issue.. That is because the settings are in the database on the server side; the client side does not have them, yet.\nThe template needs to subscribe to setting in its onCreated, I would assume. This is just a guess.\nThat being said disabling the feature altogether feels like defeat.\njavascript\n  onCreated() {\n    Meteor.subscribe('setting');\n  },. Or, more in line with current code style:\n```javascript\nTemplate.invitationCode.onCreated(() => {\n  Meteor.subscribe('setting');\n});\nTemplate.invitationCode.onRendered(() => {\n  const setting = Settings.findOne();\n  if (!setting || !setting.disableRegistration) {\n    $('#invitationcode').hide();\n  }\n});\n```\nBut needs to be tested.\nAs a side thought, I recall that the recommendation is not to change the DOM using JQuery when working with meteor.. Maybe it is not intuitive enough.\nThe two settings are independent.\n\nFirst setting: if, while browsing this board, the user adds a subtask to a card, where should that card be saved? In which board?\nSecond setting: if some other board has this board set as store for subasks, then where in this  board (in which list) should the subtasks be saved? Thus this setting will always the lists in this board.\n\nActually, you can see that unchecking \"cards can have subtasks\" will only disable first setting. Second one can still be changed.. Is there a reason for that? Beyond that it was removed because of a password issue that could have been fixed in a different way? \nHaving the mail settings in UI is a good feature, IMHO. And the settings can be integrated with the environment variables in a predictable manner:\n\nread settings from environment\nsee if there are settings in database and, if so, use those\nemit a warning if both are set.. @xet7 will do, thank you, benevolent sir. \ud83e\udd47 .

    "zagoa": "Hi, \nI fix the issue. I did a pull request. . I will investigate on it, into the next days. . Tell me if you have better result with restivus, that interest me a lot . I observed the same issue when you want to put a comment in a card. The author doesn't appear. . Ok I don't think that is a good idea to switch for restivus too. \nThat is very strange because when I use the POST method of cards the author is well display but when I use the POST method of cardComment the author is not display. And these two methods use the same hook insert. \nBut I don't understand why we have to call the hooks if we use direct access ? \n. Ok after testing the problem is solve if we do that for exemple : \n```\n  JsonRoutes.add('POST', '/api/boards/:boardId/lists/:listId/cards', function (req, res, next) {\n    Authentication.checkUserId(req.userId);\n    const paramBoardId = req.params.boardId;\n    const paramListId = req.params.listId;\n    const check = Users.findOne({_id: req.body.authorId});\n    if (typeof  check !== 'undefined') {\n      const id = Cards.direct.insert({\n        title: req.body.title,\n        boardId: paramBoardId,\n        listId: paramListId,\n        description: req.body.description,\n        userId: req.body.authorId,\n        sort: 0,\n        members: [req.body.authorId],\n      });\n      JsonRoutes.sendResult(res, {\n        code: 200,\n        data: {\n          _id: id,\n        },\n      });\n      Activities.insert({\n        userId: req.body.authorId,\n        activityType: 'createCard',\n        boardId: paramBoardId,\n        listId: paramListId,\n        cardId: id,\n      });\n} else {\n  JsonRoutes.sendResult(res, {\n    code: 401,\n  });\n}\n\n});\n```\nThis mess up the code but that is the only solution. I will do some external functions. And I will push all of that. . I have a problem, do you know how can I update the doc without using the hook ? Because we need to have the doc update. For exemple (one function to do manually the job of the hook): \nfunction cardMove(userId, doc, fieldNames) {\n  const oldListId = this.previous.listId;\n  if (_.contains(fieldNames, 'listId') && doc.listId !== oldListId) {\n    Activities.insert({\n      userId,\n      oldListId,\n      activityType: 'moveCard',\n      listId: doc.listId,\n      boardId: doc.boardId,\n      cardId: doc._id,\n    });\n  }\n}\nIf we create the card using the API and if we want to update it to move it in an other column the const oldListId = this.previous.listId; will not be initialize and we will have a problem.\nFor the moment I create a doc manually like this :  const doc = {boardid: paramBoardId, listId: paramListId, _id: id};. But I don't know, and I don't found in the documentation of the hook how can I modify the doc without using a hook. \n. My real problem is this line const oldListId = this.previous.listId; I don't understand how can I set previouswithout calling a hook.. I resolve my problem. You can check my code. I do it for the model card and cardComment.. ",

(which is where the problem is).\nI started playing with this idea over the weekend. It looks like the frontend card moving magic is jQuery UI with some callbacks (is that tested?). Again, the backend wouldn't need to be provided, just the frontend rendered, leave it to anyone wanting to port to raspberry Pi to work out storage and route handling.. Thanks, so if I were to submit a PR with a backend services definition would that be to wekan.hx or this repo?

I think I know what is causing the issue now.\nFor some reason, in the docker log there is  an additional = towards the end of the token in the password reset URL.\nIf you remove the = it should work.\n\nFor me the additional = appears just before the start of a new line. Perhaps there is some \"new line wrapping logic\" somewhere which is appending an equals sign. Would be interesting to know if we get the same behavior when not using Docker.\nThere is an alternative way of getting the password reset token - from the database.\n1. Request a password reset on the Wekan login screen\n2. Login to your MongoDB and find the user that you just reset in the users collection\ndb.getCollection('users').find({username: \"insertyourusernamehere\"})\n3. Look through the document to find the password reset token\nServices > Password > Reset > Token\n4. Append this token onto the password reset URL and it should work\ni.e. http://yourwekaninstance/reset-password/pasteyourtokenhere\nIt would be nice if the message wasn't always \"Token expired\", even when you enter a completely invalid token.\nNot sure what the security implications would be of not doing this or how easy this would be to implement, I'm assuming most of the heavy lifting is done in Meteor rather than Wekan.. Hi @rautamiekka, the screenshot is taken from PuTTY.\nYou can see from the below screenshot that other messages from the same docker logs output are not being wrapped at the same width as the URL. This would lead me to believe that it isn't the terminal causing the issue.\n\nAlso it's not just adding a new line, it's adding the = before the new line. Which is not normal line wrapping behavior for any application I know of ...\n:mag: *A few Google searches later* :mag:\nLooks a lot like this \"equals adding line wrapping stuff\" is a thing called Quoted Printable Encoding.\n\nQuoted-Printable, or QP encoding, is an encoding using printable ASCII characters (alphanumeric and the equals sign =) to transmit 8-bit data over a 7-bit data path or, generally, over a medium which is not 8-bit clean.[1] It is defined as a MIME content transfer encoding for use in e-mail.\n\nIf this is the case, I wonder if there's a simple way to make it not use this encoding when the emails are output into the Wekan log.. I'm pretty sure that the cause of this issue is because of the email encoding being used is quoted-printable as mentioned before.\nTL;DR\nWe should probably close this issue and forget about it!\nHow could we go about fixing it?\nIt looks like it would be technically possible to change the Content-Transfer-Encoding when sending emails with Meteor so that it's not quoted-printable. There doesn't appear to be a simple option with Meteor's mail package to change the encoding. However, the mail package is based on Mailcomposer and the Mailcomposer documentation says that you can change it there. But this would obviously add a fair bit of complexity as it looks like you need to build your own Mailcomposer object and throw away what Meteor's Email.send(options) let's you set normally.\nIt's not actually clear if changing the encoding would fix the issue but it would appear by reading this Stackoverflow Answer explaining the types of Content-Transfer-Encoding that changing it to 7bit might work.\nShould we \"fix\" this issue?\nProbably not, for many reasons.\nGiven that this issue is only experienced when the MAIL_URL environment variable has not been set, which is usually only when testing, I'd say that this issue could probably be closed without further action.\nAlso, this issue really has more to do with Meteor than it does with Wekan.\nThis issue is kind of user error really. These \"trouble causing\" password reset emails (or any other email) that is being output into the log are actually valid given that they are using the quoted-printable type of Content-Transfer-Encoding. But because it's being output into the log and not in an actual email, the encoding is visible to the user but not necessarily obvious to the untrained eye. The added = for the line break looks like it could be part of a valid password reset token, which is an unfortunate coincidence.\nHopefully anyone experiencing this problem in the future will find this GitHub issue and be able to use one of the workarounds in my post above.\nAdditional findings\nHere's an interesting one for you.\nIf you set your ROOT_URL to something short like localhost  it decides to use 7bit encoding.\nYou won't get the added = issue because the URL doesn't exceed 78 characters and doesn't do a line wrap and add the =.\n\nHowever if you choose a long ROOT_URL  you will get quoted-printable encoding.\nYou'll get the add =  issue because the URL exceeds 78 characters. You will get a line wrap and the additional =.\n\nThe Mailcomposer documentation seems to suggest it adjusts the encoding based on the email content type, perhaps this is why this happening.\nReferences\nDocumentation of Meteor's email API\nMailcomposer Documentation\nStackoverflow Answer explaining the types of Content-Transfer-Encoding\nPS.

As once it's built it can't be configured, and for obvious reason one in core snap is looking at /etc/ssl/certs\nIf we add openssl inside snap, then we can configure it to look to\n$SNAP_COMMON/etc/ssl/certs\nIf I manage to make test build happy to test it for me?. snap install problem is very likely caused by openVZ configuration. From what I can see they seem to disbanded loop module in their kernel. Since snappy system relies heavily on squashfs it can't even mount core system snap let alone wekan snap. Whatever is their rational without loop device it's no go.\nAs for snap it's not container. It's more different packaging system witch includes all but core system dependencies. It's lot cleaner to install/uninstall/update. More like android or iOS application experience. ",

I've started working on this feature.\nJust to give everyone an update I'm sharing the first screens of what I'm building.\nI'll follow more or less the UI and functionalities of Butler for Trello.\nI've started from rules (triggers + action) and I'll add later scheduled actions.\nSuggestions/requests are welcome.\n\n\n.

Just for my information, is this a choice to have removed the \"when a card is removed\" trigger ?\n@TiibCD Yes. I noticed it was redundant since it was basically doing what the rule \"Archive/Unarchive\" does.. The first version of this feature should be ready.\nI have decided to add the icon in the bottom right corner, since it has a different \"flow\" w.r.t the star icon.\nThe icon is shown only after the mouse over event, as for the star (should we make it always visible?).\nWhen the icon is clicked a copy of the board is created with the same title but with a \" - Copy\" appended.\nThe back-end code is basically a connection between the export and import code.\nThe user is redirected to the copied board.\nSee the preview attached.

    "danielmhair": "I agree. It probably doesn't require separation of the server and client. I just wondered whether having them separate could help others integrate their client easier. Actually, to not worry about changing code but still have the ability to run the server separately, have a command in package.json that will run only the server, allowing other clients to use do. This way, only the server code runs.. And thank you for the information. This is my first time with Meteor. So far, I'm intrigued. Especially Meteor  DDP.\nI didn't explain what my plan is. My first step is to learn Meteor and figure out how much code is needed to use meteor-client-bundle. If it's not much, then this may be the way to go.\nI have two other questions:\n1. I'm interested in adding typescript support. Are you in support of that? Angular uses Typescript, so allowing the repo to use both Vanilla Javascript and Typescript would be very helpful.\n2. I'm also interested in contributing to the API. Where would I start? (this is future, assuming I have more experience with Meteor)\n. Sorry, what I was meaning, is to use Angular (for the UI), and then make it to where you can use Wekan's API, then add a few files that allow people integrating with Wekan can use Typescript and import the Wekan APi via a library (such as installing wekan via npm, then importing the server files so integration is easier). So it's not vanilla js or ts. It's with a framework that will dramatically reduce the amount of work to make it.\nYeah, I have been contemplating how much time I have. I have already started building my own Trello/Wekan UI in angular, so that is already underway. It's more the API/Server part that I am trying to decide on (Wekan, Restyaboard, etc). I would want to add some more features to Wekan, if I do decide to go this way. \nThank you for those links. I will look into them and see what I can do.\nTo be clear about what I meant before. If we make the API of Wekan available, then other people can use any type of client or even integrate with Wekan (mobile, vanilla javascript, typescript, angular, etc), because the API is available. That is what I meant. Sorry about the confusion.. ",

The VPN is configured so that it only allows clients to connect to the server itself; it intentionally drops packets aimed elsewhere for security reasons.\nThe server uses Nginx as a reverse proxy for several different applications, hence /wekan in the ROOT_URL.. I went ahead and set up Nginx to forward to two different Wekan containers based on the client's IP range.

Thanks!. @xet7 Ah yes, the backticks are a cleaner workaround.\nNot sure what you meant about the description supporting markdown, as markdown formatting of the description is what I was reporting on :)\nIn case my wording was unclear, I didn't mean I wanted to preserve the indentation going from the editor to the formatted view, but to use markdown's indented code block feature, which works just fine unless the indentation occurs right at the beginning of the description (or a comment), where the starting indention is trimmed off (thus breaking the code block formatting).\n. V0.55 didn't fix this unfortunately: my steps to reproduce still produce the unstylized text and not a code block.\ntracking:        stable\ninstalled:       0.55 (87) 125MB -\nrefreshed:       2017-11-19 19:51:40 +0200 EET\nPerak's markdown ironically has had one issue reported about a reverse problem: someone had their first line always treated as code block (which was because they had indented the line). No bugs reported about the first line indentation being trimmed off.\n. For me the double slash regression occurred at 0.62-3-g74877fd (as it did for the reporter in #1405), whereas this edge-to-edge URL issue was already there in 0.60 (but the double slash issue wasn't). It might not definitely make them completely unrelated, but would at least hint towards it.\n. @xet7 When I try to refresh the snap, it gets stuck in Run configure hook of \"wekan\" snap if present with a node process eating up the CPU. It takes 5 minutes before snapd gives up. Now the service won't come back up, and revert also fails:\nroot@battra:~# snap revert wekan\nerror: cannot perform the following tasks:\n- Run configure hook of \"wekan\" snap if present (run hook \"configure\": )\n\n. @xet7 Unfortunately the install now also fails with the same configure hook issue as refresh did:\nroot@battra:~# snap remove wekan\nwekan removed\nroot@battra:~# snap install wekan\nerror: cannot perform the following tasks:\n- Run configure hook of \"wekan\" snap if present (run hook \"configure\": )\n\n(For mongodump, I had to replace/upgrade the Xenial package with mongodb-org-tools from the main MongoDB site, because Xenial's mongodump 2.6 failed with assertion: 17369 Backing up users and roles is only supported for clusters with auth schema versions 1 or 3, found: 5. With mongodump 3.6.2 I was able to dump the db successfully.)\nI came across this old Wekan snap report about the same issue. I enabled snap debugging as mentioned there, and will attach the result of grep snapd from during the installation attempt here.\nShould I open a new issue about this, to keep this report on topic?\n. I noticed that the service is up locally during the (non-finishing) configuration phase, and produces journal log entries as usual, I'm attaching the relevant lines here. The gist of it appears to be an \"Error: no hostname or hostnames provided in connection string\" from programs/server/node_modules/fibers/future.js:280\nI'm unable to reproduce this snap issue in a VM, but so far I've failed to pinpoint the curcial difference between the VM and my physical server.\nI've tried purging and reinstalling snapd, disabling IPv6, turning off Apache and any other services that might be in the way, rebuilding the snap with my previous settings built in but none of it has made any difference.\n. I moved my Wekan installation to a VM until the installation issue gets resolved. In the meanwhile I can confirm that 1) the double slash issue is fixed now and 2) this edge-to-edge URL issue is still there.\n. As a workaround, copying the icons and manifest from public to domain root seems to work (with Wekan snap running behind Apache here). As the files have a wekan- prefix, collisions shouldn't be an issue. Naturally, this solution does require write access to the domain root directory.\n. Nope, Chrome manifests this too:\n\n. ",

I meant that with the current solution it's not really possible to have separate translations per usecase - it's just \"what does that word mean in German\" (or some other language). And usually the answer will be \"it depends on the context\".. That's what this issue is about: Defining \"longer strings\" (or even just \"IDs\") where some might be completely identical in English but can be separately translated in other languages.\n\"this-board\" is used in boardLabel which is used in client/components/activities/activities.jade for strings like \"{{{_ 'activity-added' memberLink boardLabel}}}.\" That again is then in the translation-files like i18n/de.i18n.json (\"activity-added\": \"hat %s zu %s hinzugef\u00fcgt\").\nFor the current cases it looks like we could simply change the translation to \"diesem Board\" (context: \"to this board\"). But as soon as somebody uses that same string for things like \"delete this board\" we can't simply reuse \"this-board\" again.\nOne possible (but larger) change might be to name \"boardLabel\" to \"toBoardLabel\", add the \"zu\" in German into that translation-string get rid of \"zu\" in places like \"activity-added\".\nOther option might be separate strings \"activity-added-board\" and \"activity-added-card\" so that we don't have a sub-string boardLabel that gets translated and inserted separately.

What exact mongodb version are you using with wekan? 3.2.?\nAre there any plans for fixing the image upload issue with mongodb 3.4?. ",
    "Azbests": "My bad then, brain auto correct messed me. Will redeploy with v4.8.4.\nThanks for the reference to #1210. Will look into it and check how can I rework my setup.. 1. Yes, root url was correct. Been using those settings for a while now. I did double check just in case tho.\n2. Yep. Loaded backup that was created early this morning.\nI think that I miss represented this issue. 1.97 did work ok for a while. I think I have snap auto refresh enabled which I have yet to find how to disable. Then around 12:00 today it just stopped and threw out (wekan snap service just looped with that problem) that reboot log message that I pasted in fist post.\nIs there anything useful in that printout? aka I wonder what exactly happened. I still have a dump of that borked db. Which when loaded breaks wekan. Maybe I can try to repair it. As far as I googled mongodb has some repairdb options. I just don't know if they would be any good in this case.. ",

    "chromas-cro": "@xet7 \nI have checked Roboto font on Google fonts and when I typed same sentence as in Wekan it was displayed well. \n\nSo if this font is currently used in Wekan the problem my not be the font but maybe stylesheet or underlying os? I do not have possibility to check if same issue occurs on Windows server. \nOther popular font with polish diacritical signs is Lato, also found on Google fonts.\n. @xet7 \nAfter thorough investigation i've found that underlying problem is roboto webfont (woff2 format) provided with docker image of Wekan (probably with all releases).\nWhen generating webfont form truetype font a subsetting should be selected.\nIn default (basic) there is support for only western languages and polish characters are cut out to save font size.\n\n[screenshot from: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator]\nTo generate proper webfont with multilanguage support Custom subsetting should be selected and all languages you want to suport:\n\nWhen I generated roboto-regular and roboto-bold selecting polish language from custom subsetting and replaced these fonts in /build/programs/web.browser/app/fonts/ directory in Wekan docker image the page was displaying properly using webfont (screen from firefox inspector, see Roboto remote):\n\nSo, why you had no problem with font? Probably you had roboto fonts installed locally as system font -in that case browser do not download webfont but use local version like ttf (see Roboto system) :\n\nSo, if you be so kind and update webfonts in public/fonts dir https://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/devel/public/fonts that would be great!\nI hope you will read this and that my \"investigation\" will be helpfull for other Wekan users with similar problems :).

Also, is there an example on how to add items to the list in a post request?\nUpdate: NVM. Also, is there an example on how to add items to the list in a post request?\nUpdate: NVM. It seems like the board itself needs a member (owner). I have added it and bypassed the check if (!this.userId) when doing an API call.\n. Also the lack of this.userId seems not only to be aproblem of the boards API, it is a general problem when doing API calls.\nSo each time in a before/after (insert, update, remove) hook a userId is required it is sent as undefined.. Sure, or at least i login to get a token and use this token for my API calls\nSomething like this\ncurl  http://127.0.0.1:24000/users/login -d \"username=georg&password=123\"\nand then:\ncurl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1/api/boards/uRkK8yenZiDpWtvF5/members\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer FL4kG7u-HxYm9wZO7FPd6wlsK00CgJC1lHtDXV_taCj\" -d \"memberId=sAWoXL4Nhyi3bRxSa\"\n. From https://github.com/matb33/meteor-collection-hooks\nYou can define a defaultUserId in case you want to pass an userId to the hooks but there is no context. For instance if you are executing and API endpoint where the userId is derived from a token. Just assign the userId to CollectionHooks.defaultUserId. It will be overriden by the userId of the context if it exists.\nHave you done anything like this? To make the API work flawless? . > I think the defaultUserId option might cause race conditions or similar issues, if for example two REST-API calls arrive and the hooks for the first call are executed after the second call was processed.\nGood hint\nAnd yes the workaround is to avoid the hooks with direct.insert and call the code from the hooks in seperate functions with the userId as param from the request.. So i guess we take the workaround by calling direct.insert as a temporary solution and close this issue?. Ok i did some research, the login tokens are stored under resume.loginTokens and you can config the expiration with a setting loginExpirationInDays where null or 0 means, never delete tokens.\nWhat does this mean:\n-Rest API acquired Tokens are not separated from normal GUI login tokens\n-Deleting / replacing tokens can therefore be problematic\n-To do this however, either there has to be a way to hook into the login / logout method\n-or write a seperate logout method (api endpoint) which deletes the tokens\nSo, if you want, you can close this or if you think token handling is fine this way.

    "xarinatan": "That's intriguing indeed, I guess it must be on my side then.. not sure what's up, I have full ECC hardware and I'm running BTRFS as filesystem, I also tried to restart sandstorm, nothing really seemed to fix it so I thought it must be in the application itself. I heard Oasis runs a slightly different version of sandstorm, could that be related perhaps?. Thanks for the experimental build and tips, but I'm afraid they didn't solve the issue :( I have the same issue with Chrome on Windows as well as Firefox on Linux which I originally tried it with. A friend is observing the same issue on his account/browser (I think chrome on windows as well). \nThe website hangs for ~15 seconds before failing, and since the logs say it failed to connect to mongodb, I assume that fails to start? Do you know of a way to get the mongodb logs from sandstorm perhaps? I have full root access to the machine . Right, of course, thanks! I attached an empty wekan board's backup which wouldn't load on my server. \nLooking at the logs it seems that it just gets stuck booting up? the I/O isn't terribly slow or anything, rebooting the entire VM took less than 30 seconds, so no idea what could cause this. It was working fine before.. \nUntitled Wekan board.zip\n. Sorry for the late reply, I've been really busy the past few days. \nGood call @kentonv ! I'm running 4.14.6-1-hardened #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Dec 15 02:35:54 CET 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux on Arch, I kind of forgot about running that hardened kernel, but I never expected it to get in the way like this (it's a GRsec derivative kernel afaik).\nRunning without the hardened kernel solves my issue!\n\nThanks! And I'm sorry for the scary title, I really thought I tried everything :P \nDo you have any idea what part of the hardened kernel could be causing this? I'll contact them to let them know about this issue\n. just a note to this old thread; I just found that I can more or less reproduce this issue by pausing/saving the VM that Sandstorm is running on and keeping it paused for a while. For some reason most things work well (using existing boards, creating new grains of a lot of other apps, etc) but creating new Wekan boards causes the original error. Rebooting doesn't fix it, but turning off the VM and then starting it up again does.. The only thing I can think of is time/clock issues, but I'm running ntpd on the VM so I'm not sure what's up..  It's a very peculiar thing :thinking: it's not really an issue anymore though, just thought I'd share my findings :) . @ocdtrekkie :) I will if I figure out more, it's a very strange thing that's been haunting me for a long time, especially since I use Wekan a lot. \nMy setup is pretty straight forward; Arch Linux (for hypervisor and VM), KVM/qemu + Libvirtd + virt-manager and kimchi. I used to run a hardened kernel but I haven't done so since I ran into this issue. \nRecently the issue showed up again after I did maintenance and I couldn't figure out why, so after several reboots I turned the VM off completely and checked if the CPU settings were correct, then without changing anything started it up again and somehow that had fixed the issue. I know that KVM preserves the state of a VM's hardware when a VM's guest OS reboots, so one of the virtual devices, presumably the RTC or some other timer, must've gone haywire when the VM was paused and the host was rebooted. Other than that I don't know what could've caused it. It's also interesting that the error is limited to mostly Wekan ('s mongodb instance) and the creation of new grains, I really don't know what could cause something that specific.. I will try and get in touch with the Sandstorm developers to see if they can shed any light on the issue. . I did the same thing with a Sandstorm grain, for me the result is that the page hangs and the browser complaining about Javascript hanging (Firefox). \nI in my infinite wisdom also kind of don't have a backup for this semi-important grain :dancer: would it be possible to run wait for the patch if that could undo the problem? otherwise I might have to mess with mongodb/wiredtigerdb to undo what I did :P \nEdit: Actually, my version is slightly different, I have two cards, which are pointing to each other as parent. This is maybe why my container still loads fine but Firefox can't load the page. \nEdit2: I managed to open the grain again, just as soon as I select the involved cards the browser hangs again, so I can now kinda use the grain again!. @xet7 sounds good to me, I've gotten it back to life at least, will wait for that release so I can use those cards again :+1: \nThanks for the quick response! . @xet7 @andresmanelli would it perhaps be possible to one-time check for existing circular references when an upgrade script is ran when upgrading the database/metadata to the next version (if there is any, I'm not that familiar with the internals of wekan)?

    "hever": "Hey, I don't think that this was good idea. Archive is better than recycle bin for me. I'm using wekan for 1 month (and I'm happy) and still searching for Archive function. I want to place my completed card somewhere, where it will be stored for the future. And place it into the 'recycle bin' seems to be a not good idea.\nBy the way, it could be nice, if I can move card with drag&drop to archive (as I see this feature in trello).. @xet7 I'm sory, not Trello. Taiga.. About Archive vs Recycle bin - I'm user of Gmail. There is Recycle bin place where you move email when you want to delete it. And you can move it to the Archive, when you want to store it forever. And have ability to find it in future. Maybe, it's something what i would like to have in wekan. Users may think that after some time cards in Recycle bin will be deleted automatically.. So maye it cloud be good ideal, if there will be recycle bin and archive together. Archive for that you want to store forever and recycle bin for that you want to delete maybe after some time.. @ocdtrekkie  I think so that autodeleting is not good. User may always delete card as they're do it elsewhere.\n@xet7 There may be problem if one board is shared by many peoples. Then you have to create archive-board per normal-board and set them same people. Weird. I have last list named Archive, but I dont want to everytime look at many historical cards that have been done. What I speak about Taiga is in this video (look at it for few second). https://youtu.be/FnMBZ5ZVwjs?t=3m50s This principle is very nice. Wekan is better than Taiga, but this is great.\nI think, normal is this:\ndelete -> recycle bin -> delete forever\narchive -> archive\nSorry for commenting closed issue, again.. Hey, Gmail's auto emptying recycle bin after 30 days is not bug. It's normal function and has sense.\nBut okay, cards in recycle bin doing slow down of board so it's not good for archive. I understand. So there's could be feature request for archive function that create new board (where members will be every time same as in original board) with one list archive and archiving cards to this place. Would it be?. We have recycle bin in office and the cleaner comes up from time to time and emptied it - and it's not bug it's valid. The same behavior in my home (there's no cleaner but wife do the job). Everywhere is recycle bin a place where you do not know day or hour if everything you put in is still there. Gmail has clearly rules and there is no sense to disable it. If you want it, you do something bad. If you want to review what you earlier don't want before you lost it forever then move it to some folder but no to recycle bin (also in home, office, etc.). Moving something to recycle bin means, you are going to risky way and you can lost it (wifes and cleaners are unpredictable).. I have Wekan v0.83. So I'll need to upgrade first. It's strange because I follow your install guide and set automatic refresh. There's some problem with refresh, I'll create new issue.. Revoke new issue, after moment refreshing start working. So now I have version 0.95 and problem with checklist gone. It's working as excepted. Thanks.. Maybe same problem - my import of backup does not working well, some checklist items not imported. Trying to find where's problem and found something.\nCreate checklist -> Create item -> Delete checklist\nThen when you try export board, import will fail. This is because in exported JSON is something like this:\n... checklists\":[],\"checklistItems\":[{\"_id\":\"5obmCiwjxew6saRjb\",\"title\":\"item\",\"checklistId\":\"w8w947vMNgH3QiD25\",\"cardId\":\"ZJx9zBRaGKxsLjEZg\",\"sort\":0,\"isFinished\":false,\"userId\":\"GPgtvBwTB6kzdYruj\"}], ...\nNo checklists, but checklistItems. Maybe there is problem in moment of deleting checklist, that items of deleted checklist still exists. Or if this is some feature, import may ignore this item and go to the next items. Now, it will stop importing items of checklists and at the end of import, there's message \"400\".. How can I check wekan version number from web browser? In source code I found nothing, in UI there's no About. Anyway I've set automatic snap updates so it have to be last version.. Now I have time to check version through terminal (command snap list) and yes, I have newest Wekan v1.18.0. (My previous question is still valid.)\nSo more describe my issue. When I press tab new card is open in left column (shift tab open card in right column). It's nice. But when I'm for long time writing long text to new card and unfortunately press tab all my text is forever disappear. Then when I press shift tab in a hope there will be my precious text, only blank card is shown. There's no popup saying \"Do you really want to do this, all your text you're written will be deleted\". . \n. @xet7 \nDebian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch) stable / Firefox ESR 52.9.0 64bit. > Archives have been renamed to Recycle Bin #1429 , because it's more familiar to users than archives.\nHi, I'm not sure for this (as I mentioned in #1429). In time management world, there's always be archive at the end. Gmail has archive and it's great. Trello has archive. Etc. \nWhen you push something into archive, you'll know it's been there forever. When you push something into recycle bin, you know that after moment it will be probably still there. But you're never know what will happens in future. \nIn kanban board I think there must be two places for card that has been done. Archive for that you never want to lost. And recycle bin for that you'll know that in future you will not want. If there's only one place, it may be archive, in my opinion.. @xet7 \nYes - if I pair import with some two user on second server.. @xet7 \nPairing to the same user may lead to misconfigure - one imported is admin, another no... Better thing is only inform that everyone must be paired, some warning message is ok.. Noo, please give it to the top as it was... It's not nice and there's also some problems. \n\nOriginal design was very fine.\n. You saved absolutely minimum space and it's ugly, I'll do nothing and give it back to original place.. Hi, this problem still exists.\nServer Setup Information:\n    Did you test in newest Wekan?: Yes\n    Wekan version: 1.65.0\n    Deployment Method(snap/docker/sandstorm/mongodb bundle/source): Snap\n    Node Version: 8.12.0\nI have LDAP enabled too.. Another point of view:\nI was testing OAuth (with rocket.chat) and then want to disable it. With oauth2-disabled I can't do it. So then I set every oauth2- settings to default and \"Sign in with Oidc\" login button was still here. Until I find a row in meteor_accounts_loginServiceConfiguration in db and delete it, the button (and the bug #1874 that comes together) was still there. Maybe there is missing some unconfiguration function, that delete old config.. My apologize, I was looking for translate tool at bad place and find nothing. Button is not searchable with browser, so I firstly did not notice this.. I have problem with LDAP login. After hour of searching some debug log on server I find error on browsers console. It brings me to code if(a=req.headers[process.env.HEADER_LOGIN_EMAIL] and say req is not defined.\nLDAP login completely fail.. @xet7 now the error say \"request is not defined\" but still not work.\n(Wekan v2.47).

    "gergamel": "I think I am seeing this exact issue trying to import from an older Wekan server into a Wekan grain running on Sandstorm.\nThe exact steps I followed are:\n- Export JSON from old wekan\n- Create new board\n- Add all the users that were on the old Wekan board to the new board\n- Select \"Import Board\"->\"From Wekan\"\n- Paste in JSON\n- Map all members from the old board to their matching entry in the new board\n- Click Done\nAt this point, it LOOKS like everything has worked. I see all the boards and cards and it all looks great. However, if I close the grain and reopen it, I get \"Board not found\".\nI have created a simple board which recreates the issue for me. The JSON data I am importing is here. This has been parsed through a script to sanitize it because our old version of wekan is VERY old and the new version didn't like the data. I don't think there are any issues here because, as I said, everything seems to work great until you close the grain.\n. @xet7 \nThanks for taking a look. I'd offer to try and help, but I know basically nothing about how Sandstorm works. Our sysadmin is trying it out because it looked like it would minimise his on-premise tool management workload. It remains to be seen if this is, in fact, the case :)\nI've just started working with Docker for internal tools, so I'll have a crack at spinning up a Wekan image and try your suggestion. Quick google suggests I use the Docker Official wekanteam repo?\n. @xet7 thanks for the thought.\nI tried a couple, but couldn't remember what state I left my JSON cleaner script in, so I actually ended up making a new board in Sandstorm Wekan, exporting it from there and then just trying to import it straight back in. The JSON I used is here: https://pastebin.com/ZksS4JeV. I confirmed it has \"_id\": \"sandstorm\" at the board level.\nAgain, it looks like it has worked, but after you close the grain and reopen it, you get \"Board not found\".. ",
    "DrGraypFroot": "Hey there\nDon't know if this is still up-to-date, but I'm experiencing the same issue.\nAlso tried Wekan 1.02, same result.\nFunnily enough, even exporting a board from Sandstorm Wekan and then importing it again also causes the same issue: \"Board not found\"\nThe only way is to backup a board and then restore and rename it. That works like a charm.\nNo way to import a Standalone-Wekan Board into Sandstorm-Wekan. \nIt's no deal breaker for us, just thought I'd mention it in case someone has found a solution.\nCheers. @xet7 I'll give it a shot when I got time for it (can't work on it during worktime)\nThanks xet for your great work, it's really remarkable what you do, especially in your free time!\n@dzampino That's weird. Anything in the sandstorm log that could give an insight? Did the \"board not found\" come after reloading the page or while restoring the backup? . I replaced \"EditCardDate\" with \"DatePicker\" and restarted the Docker containers, but the DatePicker for ReceivedDate and EndDate still doesn't appear. Any ideas? Thank you :-). Hi @xadagaras \nThanks for your help! Unfortunately, adding the --build option to the docker-compose command didn't fix the issue.\nBut in that case I'll try getting Version 1.02 running, thanks a lot!\nCheers. Hi @xet7 and @florianproxi\nI wrote a simple Python3-Script for Docker-Wekan that creates a mongodump, copies it to the host-system using a naming convention like: dump-wekan-timestamp.tar.gz and automatically deletes dumps older than specified amount of days.\nMeant to be executed daily/nightly using cron.\nI'd gladly share the script, but I'm not sure how/where to upload it (I have not much experience with github).\n@xet7, maybe you can give me a hint\nCheers :-). @florianproxi @xet7 \nI uploaded the script on the wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup#python-backup-script-for-wekan-docker-environment\nHope it helps :-).

In parallel I try out following bugfix title: (item.title ? item.title : 'Automatically chosen name during migration'), for line https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/4b65c5cc3359eb090e87498b3501629cb54081e2/server/migrations.js#L187. The fix I tried worked, so making it optional should do the job as well. @xet7 It looks like that the optional property does not have any effect.\nI still get the exact same error as before.\nOverall I would argue, that it is good that we enforce a title for checklists. Maybe it has also other negative effects if we allow undefined title properties.\nUsing a english default title is a bad UX for users who selected an other language, but I don't think this will happen often. All migrations after this bugfix won't encounter this problem.. @xet7 \n- We are now at V1.18 and come from v0.60\n- Our ROOT_URL is correctly set (including the protocol)\nI started to debug this and can tell you that this error only occurs on boards which I share with other members. I saw somewhere that there was a security issue related to fetching users. Maybe this fix is to strict.\nIf you reload the page while a card is open, Wekan tries to get the username by looking up the board members -> fetching the user objects -> reading the username property.\nBut I don't get the user object of users other than me during this page reload\nI hope this helps you finding the bug. @xet7 \nI got your hint and I'm willing to spend as much spare time as I have on problems we encounter in our company.\nFirst I thought the mentioned security fix would prevent getting the username, but this is not the case after reading the infos from the Hall-Of-fame.\nI could track the error down till https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/056843d66c361594d5d4478cfe86e2e405333b91/client/components/main/editor.js#L13\nHere the call Users.findOne(member.userId) will give a result for my userId but not for another userId. Do you have a clue where I could look for a restriction like that?. @xet: I see and I guess I found the issue here, but I would like to discuss if my planned change would open a security issue. Do you have a preferred way to discuss those things (e.g. reach out on IRC ). Instead of: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/6c7eab4456f8608ae3893d2200b759d426863cd2/server/publications/people.js#L9\nI would put\nif (user && user.isAdmin) {\n    return Users.find({}, {\n      limit,\n      sort: {\n        createdAt: -1\n      },\n      fields: {\n        'username': 1,\n        'profile.fullname': 1,\n        'isAdmin': 1,\n        'emails': 1,\n        'createdAt': 1,\n        'loginDisabled': 1,\n      },\n    });\n  } else {\n    return Users.find({}, {\n      limit,\n      sort: {\n        createdAt: -1\n      },\n      fields: {\n        'username': 1\n      },\n    });\n  }\nThis change fixes our bug, but the thing is that I don't know the full consequences of this change. I tried if this would allow me to query user object by the ID without being logged in which is not the case. But not being familiar with meteor I dislike to do this change without having people with knowledge have a look. BTW. do you have a page with coding guidelines and a suggest IDE Setup to work on Wekan. Moreover, do you think on adding some automated test to Wekan?. Okay I was a bit fast, it fixes the error but it prevents that the infos about the other users are fully loaded. See the following  image, which shows the avatars of the other board members:\n. ",

I am logged in though, checked this twice. Also a re-login doesn't solve this problem.. @xet7 I use Firefox as my main browser :) but I also can't move cards in the Swimlane view and have the issue that I can't exit the swimlane view.. @xet7 Thank you! I was on the latest version already (wekanteam/wekan:latest) and even after reinstalling, moving cards did not work (or switching from swimlanes to lists).\nHowever, as you suggested, switching back to v0.63 resolved my issues. I guess I'll wait for a bugfix release then.. @xet7 I also use Firefox 58.0 on Manjaro Linux (which is basically the same as Arch Linux) x64.. @xet7 I already tried that one a couple of minutes ago - but still no luck :(. @xet7 \nSo I stopped wekan-app, did \"docker rm wekan-app\" and removed all wekan-app images with \"docker rmi <...>\".

    "quantazelle": "I was going to add here my own issue, but this is really part of this bigger issue that @2Belette brought up. The icon for checklist names is a checked-off icon. It makes it looks like the checklist is complete:\n\n@xet7 Right now the workflow in Trello is one checklist per card and it is unnamed. Which makes sense because the checklist items are kind of sub-tasks under the card. \nIf there needs to another checklist for the card, it could be added as another item, and then you can name that one, or name both. But creating a named checklist every time for every card is pretty clunky, and I agree with @2Belette on that. If you'll see, I just created \"main\" because I didn't know what else to call it. It's redundant. . Both of those icons imply a state, either \"completed\" (with a check) or \"uncompleted\" (a box without a check.) \nI would say just use the bold typeface and indent it.\nMaterial Design has one of the best UI resources I've seen, and they have come to a similar conclusion:\n\nA second option would be a \"Collapse / Expand\" (I've linked those to [+] and [-] in the FA library) icon set:\n\nHere's a mobile Apple version that uses an inverted list name and caret right / caret down (> V) :\n\n.

    "ChronikEwok": "Hi all, \nI'm new here so firstly, thanks to everyone who has contributed to this project, it's a great tool.\nI was looking into this issue and hopefully the below helps.\nFrom my understanding, when the boardBody.jade template attempts to execute the below lines, there are issues with the isViewSwimlanes and isViewLists functions.\n\nWhen you look at those functions in boardBody.js, they both rely on having a currentUser. Obviously in the case of an anonymous user, there is no currentUser value, so both functions will return false, and the template returns neither view. \n\nThere are a few solutions, but since we're viewing the board in either Swimlane OR List view, the template should perhaps be an 'if else' statement as follows:\n\nConsequently, it will default to List View when you're viewing as an anonymous user. \nAlternatively, the isViewSwimlanes and isViewLists functions should have some sort of exception for when there is no user.\nI'm relatively new to Wekan/Meteor, so please review this fix and whether it violates any permission settings and apply as needed.\nAlso, I haven't fully tested this, but there is at least one other instance where this issue with an undefined currentUser breaks some functionality when a non-user is viewing a public board. That instance being when clicking on a card to view its details. This arises at the start of the swimlane.js component in the currentCardIsInThisList function:\n\nI don't fully understand the reason behind the logic here, as I'm not sure why 'false' is an option to return, but the developer of this component probably has a valid explanation. However to be able to view the card details, you can again rearrange the 'if else' statement and add an exception as follows:\n\nHowever, there is still an issue with switching to Swimlane View, as you still get that 'null' text displayed beside the icon as mentioned previously. \nHopefully this helps, but let me know if it needs further looking into. I'm currently using Wekan on a project so hopefully can contribute more in future.\n. Thanks @ocdtrekkie \nWith the second one, the 'currentCard.listId === listId' statement should catch whether it's in the correct list or not. That final else statement seems to catch if there is no currentUser.profile.boardView value, which unfortunately means it won't show card details for non-users. The amendment I made will default to List View if there is no user.\nIn general, when the swimlanes were configured, they didn't account for public boards where there is no user. So as a user, the board view can be toggled by changing the currentUser.profile.boardView value. But in order to toggle the board view as a non-user, perhaps the best solution is to setup a session property that can be toggled?. With the issue of not being able to display card details, you can look at the second half of my first post here for where the issue is in the code and the fix I used for it. Hope that helps.. > \n\n@ChronikEwok\nThanks for your fix! Would you like to have $15 bounty from this issue? If yes, you can claim it at BountySource.\nAnother alternative is to give that bounty to me, to support my maintaining of Wekan.\nWhat would you like to do?\n\nHappy for you to have the bounty @xet7 \nThanks for maintaining this great project.\n.

Alright, I can't help but share my designer skills ;-) :\n\n(I just edited the CSS on Firefox to see how this can be done)\nI do not really like the thing because we will end up with a Christmas tree quite easily.\nSo I googled a bit the various designs the other kanbans have and here is a few options:\nhttps://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-board-examples-for-development-and-operations/:\n\nThey seem to have a per swimlane background pattern, but no colors.\nThere is an other one at https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/kanban-software/kanban-board-examples/\n\nI like the kanbanize option (just above) as this would not cripple the board with terrible colors. Also I wonder if the choice of having the swimlane name on the side was just the default or if you used to have it horizontally stretched accross all of the swimlane.\nWith an horizontal swimlane header, we could just colorize this header, and we could in the same way colorize the lists headers too.. @xet7 \nHere is my version of the horizontal layout for the swimlanes headers (no colors yet), would that be OK?\n\nThe header now act as a separator between the swimlanes and can be colorized without much trouble.\nNote also that the + Add Simlane button gets moved to the bottom of the board. Getting closer:\n\nI just need to insert the swimlane at the correct place (below the one that was clicked on), and the PR will be ready. > For changes to REST API, please document it to wiki directly to some related or new page:\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API-Role\nI just sent a PR to automatically generate the docs: #1965. If you don't like it, I can always copy/paste the markdown in the wiki.. > What commands you use to generate documentation?\nI think I have it written in the openapi/README.md:\nwiddershins -e ./widdershins_env.json ../public/wekan_api.yml -o wekan_api.md\n\n\nPlease separate API to different pages by topic, like at Wekan GitHub wiki. Now they are at one very long page, it's very hard to find info fast.\n\nI wished I was able to do it before submitting the PR, but couldn't really get to it.\nEither the openapi specification I am producing is not good enough, or the tool (widdershins) is not the right one. Other tools I had a look at today produce a different output, but some are standalone servers, so not ideal. I wanted to produce a markdown set of pages, but maybe other solutions might fit better (like asciidoc, doxygen or sphinx).\n\nIt would be very nice to generate Wekan documentation website that had well organized navigation.\n\nagree :). > One possible way to present documentation would be like Sandstorm does:\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/tree/master/docs\nThis is using mkdocs, and also relies on markdown. I am fine with this if you prefer it that way, but processing the OpenAPI file into this will be more costly (IMO, we need a custom script that needs to be maintained).\nOTOH, widdershins has been designed with slate in mind. This produces a nice single we page that has a sidebar which allows to quickly jump between sections (see https://lord.github.io/slate/).\nSo we could convert the openapi spec into a slate webpage that is pushed on github pages and the wiki only references it.\n\nWekan docs were originally moved from GitHub repo to GitHub wiki so it would be easier for Wekan contributors to update documentation. Not many documentation contributors are familiar with adding PRs.\nCurrent way to contribute documentation is to add text to wiki, and add PR to Wekan website to host images or animgifs. It would be nice to make contributing even easier.\n\nI completely understand, and I think having the wiki is probably the best. I don't have an easy solution for the images however. You could rely on a workaround like https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib/wiki/How-to:-Add-images-to-the-Wiki but having the images properly hosted would be better.. > Slate looks very nice.\nYep. I'll try to come up with a prototype for making the decision on whether we should use it or not.\n\nCould this PR go to Wekan website?\nhttps://github.com/wekan/wekan.github.io\n\nSure. I still think the openapi spec should be shipped in the public directory of the current wekan code. This way, when you connect to a wekan instance, you get the actual embedded API and can use it properly as it is intended to be used.\nSo when releasing a new version, I guess the doc should be generated in the wekan website and the spec copied over (if there has been API changes).\n\nAnd then generated documentation would be at api directory, https://wekan.github.io/api ?\n\nIt would be even better to see if we can version it (https://wekan.github.io/api/v1.68, https://wekan.github.io/api/1.70, etc...), so we can actually refer to the correct documentation directly.. @xet7 \nOK, I'll do what I can\nMeanwhile, I just pushed a new update of this branch. I don't think we want to merge it yet as the resulting API spec is still in git, and there is no automation.\nHowever, I used this latest version (with tags and some JSDoc parsing) to publish a prototype here: https://bentiss.github.io/wekan-slate\nThere are a bunch of things to fix (like why the list on the left is almost alphabetically sorted), we probably need more doc, but this is a start.. Small update here to say that this has not fell through the cracks.\nI spent a good amount of time adding JSDocs to the REST API so we get something nicer in the end:\nhttps://people.freedesktop.org/~tissoire/wekan_api.html\nI think this is mostly it, but there are a few functions that are not properly documented in term of parameter typing:\n- [ ] Board.add_board_label -> the label parameter is not a string but a collection of {color, name}\n- [ ] Card.edit_card -> the parameters labelIds, customFields and members are not a string but collections too.\nI can have a local workaround, but I think it would be better to have a correct mapping of the API, especially because this can be used to generate client codes from it.\nI also need to make sure python3.6 is used as I use the f-string quite a lot.\nThe Dockerfile is now updated to generate the openapi spec during the build.\nYou can generate the HTML file I linked above by using the api2html node module:\napi2html -c public/wekan-logo-header.png -o /tmp/api.html public/wekan_api.yml\nSo I guess adding this to the maintainers script should be easy now.\nI have now 2 question @xet7 : \n- for generating the snaps, which debian/ubuntu version are you using? The container on dockerhub to generate snapcrafts is using Ubuntu 16.04 IIRC, and this doesn't ship with python 3.6\n- Can you have a look at the JSDocs I put and tell me if this is acceptable? (especially the @return_type tag). >>  - Can you have a look at the JSDocs I put and tell me if this is acceptable? (especially the @return_type tag)\n\nWhat do you mean? Where?\n\nFor instance, in models/cards.js I have:\nJS\n  /**\n   * @operation get_all_cards\n   * @summary get all cards attached to a list\n   *\n   * @param {string} boardId the board ID\n   * @param {string} listId the list ID\n   * @return_type [{_id: string,\n   *                title: string,\n   *                description: string}]\n   */\nThe @return_type tag is definitively not standard, but I couldn't find a way to express the various fields in the returned dict.\nA proper standard JSDoc tag would be:\nJS\n  /**\n   * ...\n   * @returns {Array} an array of {_id, title and description}\n   */\nThe problem here is that the description of the items in the dict is free form, so rather hard to parse in the end.\nAn other solution might be to use sphinx as the type can be more defined as far as I can tell, but there is no guarantees I'll get to the same results :(\n\nI mean https://api.wekan.team/v1.70/\n\nHmm, I can't seem to access the website just yet. Maybe I need to wait for the DNS entry to get refreshed?\nRegarding embedding the API in snaps/Dockers, the solution of an external service is nice, but I would personalty prefer the api to be generated and embedded as they are build. This would allow to spot earlier the issues.\nMaybe the solution would be to write down the documentation directly in the openapi language. The previous example looks like the following, but I find it harder to write down than JSDocs:\nYAML\n  /api/boards/{board}/lists/{list}/cards:\n    get:\n      operationId: get_all_cards\n      summary: get all cards attached to a list\n      tags:\n        - Cards\n      parameters:\n        - name: board\n          in: path\n          description: |\n            the board ID\n          type: string\n          required: true\n        - name: list\n          in: path\n          description: |\n            the list ID\n          type: string\n          required: true\n      produces:\n        - application/json\n      security:\n          - UserSecurity: []\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: |-\n            200 response\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                _id:\n                  type: string\n                title:\n                  type: string\n                description:\n                  type: string\nAnyway, I might just replace the 61 occurrences of f-strings in generate_openapi.py into python 3.0 compatibles ones to solve the issue entirely.. > I have not created that https://api.wekan.team subdomain yet.\nheh :)\n\nI don't know is embedding API docs good idea. If someone is running many Wekan Docker containers to use multiple cores of server, space usage really adds up.\n\nWell, we only need to embed the openapi yaml file, not the html. The YAML is 73K once generated. And having it embedded means a client can retrieve it on the service directly and can use the accurate API directly.\nThe other point of having it embedded is because most of the openapi clients expects it to be the case, and they automatically replace the host in the client object by the domain you used to retrieve the API.\nActually, what could be done is to have only a small almost static embedded file that just references the yaml in the proper api.wekan.team folder. This way, we win on all sides: generating the embedded file is just a cat away, and we don't need the python 3.6 requirement everywhere (and don't need to install/remove python in Dockerfile/snapcraft.yml)\n. So, after a long period of time, this is hopefully in a better shape:\n- the yaml file corresponding to the REST API is now embedded in /api/wekan.yml for both snaps and docker\n- the html file is also generated and embedded in the snap and docker images in /api/wekan.html\n- there is a custom JSDoc parser that can now provide the same level of details we have in the wiki\n- many improvements in the python script :)\nI made sure we can ship the html files in the snap and docker images, but honestly, I think using a https://api.wekan.team subdomain would be better.\nAdding the doc generation to your maintainer scripts should be easy as you just need esprima-python, the 2 node modules api2html and mkdirp.\n\nHmm, probably it would be good to have documentation added to translatable strings and have all that in embedded into wekan as help buttons (or something similar) so that every feature would documented, with descriptions what would be there. Also Wekan website text could be added to translatable strings and have Wekan website in many languages.\n\nI am not sure translating the REST API doc is a good idea. The persons who are using it are developers and English is a requirement. We can always add a post-processing to translate the doc, but is it worth it?\nBut I agree, translating the website is a good idea though :). And an example of generated file (from the snap, with my to-be-submitted card-colors patch) can be found here: https://bentiss.github.io/wekan-slate/wekan.html. grmbl, of course, the html was not correctly generated in the docker image.\nFixed now.. > - change WIP Limit, for example (3/1), black font color to something else (not blue - that color means link), and also change WIP Limit color on List hamburger menu. That way it's easy to see what is WIP limit color and what is card count black.\nI must confess I don't really like this. I have a feeling this will become too \"christmas tree\", and given I am not a UX designer, the final rendering will be terrible. I was thinking at using orange or green, but that would need to be dynamic, so probably better to have the one needing both card count and WIP limit to be display to make the final choice.\nI'll amend the PR to drop the first patch and amend the third as mentioned in the comment above.. Problem is when you don't have the WIP limit, this would resemble that way:\nListname 3 cards\n\nThere is no clear separation between the List name and the card count. I like however to have the font smaller on the card count. Maybe that's sufficient enough. So, with screenshots:\noriginal:\n\nitalic:\n\nsmaller (found by luck, and I like this one actually):\n\n. > Smaller one is very nice :)\nIndeed.\nPR updated. @arradoq just to check the obvious, do you have WITH_API wekan environment variable set to true?\nOn a current edge test wekan instance, with WITH_API=true and ROOT_URL set to http://localhost:3000 I can do:\n```shell\n$> curl -X POST \"http://localhost:3000/users/login\" -H  \"accept: application/json\" -H  \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" -d \"username=admin&password=mypassword\"\n{\n  \"id\": \"ZPnFGmCJ3AKadrC32\",\n  \"token\": \"5FUA79ozpqP7G0DiqZpuTbb2smO6seJsBC0cZ-5yP1v\",\n  \"tokenExpires\": \"2019-04-23T09:02:19.742Z\"\n}%\n$> curl -X GET \"http://localhost:3000/api/boards\" -H  \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer 5FUA79ozpqP7G0DiqZpuTbb2smO6seJsBC0cZ-5yP1v\"\n[\n  {\n    \"_id\": \"SypYxZ4YzxGwFh47f\",\n    \"title\": \"Welcome Board\"\n  }\n]%\n```\n(note, use JSON content type works better, but for most calls, you can also use the x-www-form-urlencoded ones)\n@xet7: as for more concrete examples, with the openapi in place, you can use https://editor.swagger.io/:\nJust import the wekan.yml file, and use the client generator. The produced client is not entirely compatible as the Authorization token is not standard (I couldn't get this right), but it gives some nice base for an implementation.\nI'll also publish soon-ish my python binding that makes use of the openapi and bravado python module for a more pythonic version of the API.. This should be fixed by 1cfe084cc29631ef\nCan you retry the latest version?. @xet7 \nthe infinite scrolling is a nice idea, and I can confirm this reduces the loading time of a big board (thus the implementation in #2144).\nRegarding loading the internationalization, are you sure this is what takes time? I am used to good machines with big amount of memory, but still, the tests showed here that the processing of the hidden cards is taking most of the time.\nRegarding the concurrent accesses to the database with several users, I ended up having 3 replicates pods on the openshift cluster where the application is hosted. This might not scale up to 200 or more users (we are more 10-20), but this greatly reduces the load between the pods.. > You could add your openshift changes to https://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/edge/openshift\nWell, I just used the UI and clicked the up arrow twice to have 3 pods :). > You can do git pull on edge branch. I did change IFTTT Rules dropdown colors to translated text with dropdown having both text and color.\nSounds good. However, Firefox 64 doesn't seem to appreciate the background color per item. They all stay white.\n\nBut maybe that dropdown button itself could have color applied also, that way text would not need to be there.\n\nHaving some feedback on the chosen color would be nice, indeed. Maybe we can just use the color picker in the IFTTT case too, and make the button changing color depending on the selected color.\n . @xet7 \nI'll try to have a look.. I realized there was a bug in the translated colors for the labels. Please see #2119. > How this is visible to you? Can you add screenshot? Maybe I did build Wekan wrong and did not see change correctly.\nSure: \n\n\nFor me it seems the change is that you removed unset card color button, and replaced it with white color. I think unset card color button was better.\n\nYes, I removed the unset button in favor of the white slot. This was to be consistent between the rules IFTTT and the \"set Color\" hamburger menu. I couldn't figure out how to represent the unset parameter in the FTTT, so using 'white' is kind of a short cut. Note that in the end, the result is the same, the color is dropped from the card.\n\nI tried to ask is it possible that in Rules wizard, where is dropdown of colors with color names, can it be replaced with similar palette of colors as in card Set Color, so that colors would also work in Firefox. But I don't know is it possible. Another possibility would be to look is it possible to get some compatible color code that would show in Firefox.\n\nThat's what is supposed to be in 55ea6c0 in this PR and in the picture above. Forced push the branch:\n- keep the Unset button for the hamburger entry as in current master\n- keep the new white entry in the IFTTT dropdown, so we can have set color to white.. @xet7 \nI just forced push the branch with a fix for the popups titles.\nI guess it is ready for prime time now :). Regarding the phone view: I think the horizontal layout fits better, the text is not vertical anymore and the space taken by the swimlane header is much reduced..  >>  This was a bug I had when I created a bunch of Lists and Swimlanes from the API: it was not possible to reorder them (sort being null).\n\n\nWe should probably do the same for the Cards inside a list.\n\nYes.\n\nOK, done.\nSo it turns out there are no null values possible for cards: there is a default ('') and when creating the card through the API, the sort is set to 0. So I just added a patch to compute a better sort value based on the number of present cards.. @xet7 \nWhile moving the new tree to production, I realized that there is a glitch when there are a lot of cards on the lists. The swimlanes are supposed to map the entire screen, but in that case, the header is behind the previous swimlane, and the members assigned are overlapping.\nTL;DR: please hold a release before a fix is found. Sorry.. Hard to say given I am not a designer :)\nKanbanize has a small colored-border at the top of the lists. We can use the idea to have something similar (the other way around, given the swimlanes are above the lists):\n\nI find this design slightly better. And FWIW, I find the flat swimlanes colors nice :). @xet7 \nBTW, sorry for the mess, I opened the PR against the devel branch, instead of edge. This one is on top of the previous, so still on devel. You might want to merge both at some point.. @xet7 \nThanks for properly fixing the horizontal behavior!. @xet7 \nI am actually trying to understand why the automate scrolling on the card details view is now also broken (horizontally, and slightly less vertically). I think this is all related to how I needed to add one more level in the js-swimlanes, and hopefully fixing properly the source of the problem will also solve those horizontal scrollbar disappearing. OK, so the main difference between now and v2.02 is that in v2.02, scrolling appear on the BoardBody, so there is only one horizontal scrollbar at the bottom and one vertical on the left (plus per list vertical scrollbars). On the new code, there is one horizontal scrollbar per swimlane, which confuses both the automatic scroll and the rendering on FF 60.\nI'll try to find a solution.. .... and if the list has more than 10 cards but they do not fill up the entire container (i.e. no scrolling bar available), there is no way of retrieving the rest of the cards but resizing the window. :(\n@xet7: please do not merge it just yet until this is fixed (I won't be able to fix it today IMO). @xet7 \nI just forced push the branch. It should be better now:\n- there is already infinite scrolling in the wekan code for the activities list. However, using this code has not been a good experience here given the constraints of the cards (variable height mostly)\n- I relied on the idea of checking if the spinner was shown on the list to trigger the next page. This seems to be working quite well.\n- 'add a new card' also makes sure the card limit gets increased when necessary\n- the code to update the card limit is run when the window gets resized, or we might end up in situation where the spinner stays here without any way of expanding the list of cards.. > In Lists and Swimlane mode, when I'm writing text to minicard, pressing Enter duplicates the same text to next card.\n\nPressing Enter should add card below, and go to card below, without duplicating text.\n\nthanks for spotting this, fixed.\n\nPressing Shift-Enter should go to next line on current card.\n\nThis is not the current behavior on edge. Let me see if I can find the culprit.. >>  Pressing Shift-Enter should go to next line on current card.\n\n\nThis is not the current behavior on edge.

I have a local workaround, but the reshuffling is all jumpy. I can't really revert to one div per swimlane because of the Firefox bug introduced in v2.04 IIRC.\nSo we need to adapt the sortable pattern to allow it to skip the slots between the headers and the list of cards in each swimlane.. I just realized this only happens in the Swimlane view. > Problem is, All Board page keeps reordering boards all the time, making Wekan a game can correct board be clicked to open that board.\n@xet7: well, it's stable on my side. The boards are reshuffling if we do change their colors, but they reach a stable point where they do not move.\nI would personally not order them by color but only keep the star and title ordering. The colors are a good way of visually remembering which card is which, but ordering the boards by color makes this point moot IMO.\n@sfahrenholz : indeed, it seems like a new bug. It might be related to @xet7 change, but not entirely sure. I can have a look on Monday.. @sfahrenholz Could you open a new bug with your screenshot?\nI bisected the bug to 3c49e2d0ede and I am not sure how to solve this. It looks like the cards are still created, but they are not populated in the answer.. @xet7 regarding the endless sorting, maybe you are hitting https://docs.meteor.com/api/collections.html#sortspecifiers:\n\nThe last form will only work if your JavaScript implementation preserves the order of keys in objects. Most do, most of the time, but it\u2019s up to you to be sure.\n\nSo maybe, using the array notation [['stars', 'desc'], 'color', 'title', 'description'] will solve it. @xet7 \nI am not sure I understand the problem fully. I do realized today that the order might change if some boards have the same title and description. But I have the impression that you are seeing the boards changing and being sorted randomly?\nFor fixing the same title and description, and I think we could simply also order by creation date or _id to have a reliable sort.. hmm, indeed that's an infinite scroll issue, and so I guess I am the one that will have to fix it.\nWhat happens is when you zoom out, the column might be long enough to show all of the currently loaded cards, and the animation, which hides the scrollbar. And this is a corner case that I thought have fixed but apparently not.. Thinking of this more, the WIP limit is set per list, so here, we should probably keep the full count of cards, not just the ones that are in the current swimlane. I'll drop this change in the next version.. I hope this is not your actual API key...\nThose files (.deploy/rafaelrglima/*) looks very personal, and I would assume you haven't put personal credentials in those. (hint, if you did, you want to revoke all of them).. Oh, OK.\nThen I guess sorry for the noise then :). > In Lists and Swimlane mode, when I'm writing text to minicard, pressing Enter duplicates the same text to next card.\n\nPressing Enter should add card below, and go to card below, without duplicating text.\n\nyep, typo: pthis.cardlimit.get() should be this.cardlimit.get()\nThis must have chimed in while I updated the comment above, sorry..

Delete some of the custom fields created in step 3.\n6. Update to Wekan v1.04\n7. Update to Wekan v1.07\n8. Check if the board created in step 2 is still accessible.. According to #1725, seems like it doesn't have to upgrade from 1.03 to get the bug.\nReproduce with above step 2-5.. Duplicate of #491?. Duplicate of #491?. @xet7 Someone please review this?. @xet7 then should I just change = -> == in every language?. I think the argument for both behaviors is equally true:\nOn one hand, I've seen many new users trying to save by clicking outside, so it is reasonable to make clicking outside to save. OTOH, if the user expects it to save, when it is not, the user can always re-enter what they have just entered. But if the user expects it to discard, when it is actually saved, the old data is lost forever and there will be no way to recover. (It is much more likely to remember the new input than the old data)\nI think the current behavior in \"description\" field is fine. It saves the input into a temporary \"unsaved description\" and asks the user whether they would like to discard it.. @pravdomil But I'm pretty sure you can find plenty of web apps these days that do the opposite.\nAnd in the renaming example, you can always undo. But in Wekan you cannot (if it saves when you intended to discard).. +1 for the great work @TNick.\nHowever, I tried the feature, there is a potentially confusing issue:\nIf no board is selected to keep the subtask under subtasks settings, which is the default, unlinking the subtask with its parent creates unexpected result - if unlinked, the subtask would simply disappear from the board, and all activities related to it become \"undefined\".\nBy linking, I mean to change card's parent of an existing task, like this:\n\nTo solve this issue, the user must manually select a board instead of (none) under deposit subtasks to this board, all disappeared cards would re-appear in the board selected.\n\nP.S. I believe it would be better to use \"save\" instead of \"deposit\" (in the second image), just my personal opinion tho.. @xet7 Yes, I understand your concern. But it seems that the original implementation used i18n, and I don't really see how could we change the order of those without modifying i18n.\nMoreover, consider that the translation in other languages could also be wrong because they followed the order in the main language (or the translator could make an adjustment to produce a technically wrong but more understandable translation, or in some languages maybe it makes more sense placing the name before \"moved\"). In any way, I think we need translators to review and possibly rectify the translation, it's inconvenient but unavoidable.. But I would agree that maybe we should change the code to include a placeholder for username in this string. (I would need to learn Meteor to do that, it's already on my list, but probably not very soon)\n\nMaybe in some languages it does not makes sense to have the username as the very first thing in the message.. @xet7 I'm sorry but I don't think I'll be able to work on including a placeholder for the username due to change of priority at work. Please close this PR if you don't feel like merging it in its current state. Thank you for your understanding, and for this awesome project :heart: . Oops, duplicate of #833 . Reopen?\nI think we should set up the reference with an internal ID instead of a URL. And btw, attachments do not break in the same situation, so maybe just copy the solution to user avatars?. Actually, this is not only an issue for deleting subtask. Deleting a checklist from a card with long description suffers from the same issue too. The confirmation message is off the screen below while the vertical scrollbar is locked at the top.\n\nTested on 1.23.\nWorkaround\nUse the mobile version (if using Chrome on PC, open your developer console and enable \"toggle device toolbar\", select a mobile from the dropdown)\n\n. > Wekan version:\n\nNo idea how to find this, not in admin panel\n\nYou can find it from admin panel -> Version (top navigation, along with People and Settings).

All users just end up as admin and blank entries for username and email address. Do you think I need to implement a loginhandler.js for vanilla wekan similar to wekan-ldap?  Does the above boardView fix help my situation?\nUnfortunately, I still have a poor understanding of the overall wekan architecture and the ways that the different wekan/* projects relate to one another. . @xet7 I am directly updating /build/programs/server/packages/salleman_oidc.js in my test pod per https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1874#issuecomment-446922469\nI have set debug = true; but I am not getting any output on the console.

No idea why it suddenly started showing up.. @xet7 @tiagoefreitas @gil0109 I have mapped the Azure values as suggested and the debug output in salleman_oidc.js confirms that my fields have the expected values.

If populated and an admin does not exist, the user gets created.\n. @xet7 I have made a small parameter change to the salleman code to enable debugging.  As soon as it is merged I will create a PR to pull it into wekan.  If all that works as expected I will bump salleman again with parameters for the OIDC mappings.  And then I'll tackle the admin code.\nAny recommendations on where the admin creation logic should live?. @xet7 Now that the debugging, parameters, and documentation are done, I was gonna look at the admin creation logic.  Only issue is that I don't know where I should put that code.  Do you have any suggestions?\nAlso, can this issue be closed?. Happy to help debug where I can.

I would be happy to test any builds that implement Kerberos auth.  I don't even think complete transparency is a requirement.  Clicking a Kerberos/SPNEGO/SAML button would get me 90% of the value.  We don't have passwords in our environment, so the choice is either Kerberos or maintaining local users/passwords (yuck).. After some discussions internally, the SAML route might be better for us.  For those of us doing not using sandstorm, is it just a matter of incorporating the SAML packages into the edge branch?. @xet7 I think I will just switch over to this thread, as my questions are not Kerberos\\NTLM related anymore.  Thanks for the advice.\n\n538\n. I'll test v1.82 from quay.  Thanks.. Same list for v1.82\nwekan182-scan-results.txt\n. meteor-1.8 resolves 7 of 23 highs.  Good progress.\nwekan-meteor18-scan-results.txt\n. I'll take a look at the Dockerfile for meteor-1.8 and see if I can resolve any of the others.  I have not submitted to this project before.  I assume I just clone and then submit a PR?. OK, so I may not be able to help with this.  I scanned the underlying buster-slim image and it is clean (other than an open CVE for which there is not yet a patch).  The packages that need to be updated are not being installed directly in the Dockerfile that I can tell.  I am guessing that meteor or another high level component is adding them.  Not sure what action can be taken in the wekan project other then adopting more up to date components as quickly as possible--which you already seem to be doing.\nI'll let you decide if you want to keep this issue open or close it.. We use a product called Twistlock to do the scanning.  I'll get the latest edge scanned and see how much that helps.. Not a substantial change on the edge build.. \nwekan-meteor181-scan-results.txt\nNo real change.. @xet7 better, but still a number of open issues.  I don't think this is related to cosmic, so much as meteor or some of the other packages Wekan is built on.\nscan-results-meteor-18-cosmic.txt\n. Can I ask what makes doorkeeper the only option?  I would have thought (always dangerous, I know!) that with OIDC/OAUTH2 being standards, any compliant provider would work.  . @xet7 I pulled the latest devel build from quay after the merge, but did not see the code changes.  How long do I need to wait usually after a merge before pulling a build for testing?. Also, is there a way to see which version of a meteor package is installed in the running container?  Is there a file I can cat to confirm that the expected code/version is present in a build?. @xet7 Good news.  Authentication works on Azure.  However, it just makes me admin without a username/email.  I'll keep looking and see how it maps oidc identity to wekan identity.  If you have any good links, feel free to pass them my way.. So do you think I need to implement a login handler for wekan/wekan similar to wekan/wekan-ldap?. @xet7 I updated the wiki to assume this code would be released in v2.21.

Because services are still different init.d or systemd I did not include that step.\nYes it does not auto-update, but unless bugs are encountered and grave enough to warrant upgrading the boards I deployed generally don't get upgraded for quite a while. The upgrade, if I understand nodejs documentation right, should simply be a matter of grabbing the new release and installing it over the old one. That, as maintenance goes, is not a complex task and I have a few pieces of software that require this as no docker image or other is available.\nIn reality I much prefer using repositories to deploy, so an apt repo to make it as easy as apt-get install would be the easiest and likely most used method of installation and maintaining wekan. I very much dislike docker and other containerization systems, because they add another layer of possible failures and systems to maintain and automated upgrades are mostly unwanted anyways, but that is a topic for another time.\nI would say a good comprise would be adding a link to the documentation for \"Quick and Dirty\" guide on how to simply get it installed. From there moving to containers and \"enabling autoupdate\" would be the next logical step, rather than starting with having to learn a completely new containerization system just to see if wekan is what they are looking for. Maybe that is just me, but that is how other software documentation seems to be structured from my experience.. The boards I have deployed all run internally and are not accessible through the web and run on virtual machines, so the chances of someone using it to break in is lessened. Of course keeping software up to date is going to be better security, but even that is no guarantee and sometimes holes are even introduced through bad maintaining. As soon as a software depends on other software to operate you are at the mercy of those maintainers. Nodejs, mongodb could break any day and leak data or open holes in security. By no means a reason not to exercise caution and apply security, but I doubt wekan itself has had such huge holes outside of the vulnerabilities that widely affect other software too. Generally the update cycle for these machines is somewhere 1-4 months depending on new features and critical fixes. Major security issues have everyone scrambling to update any software, for everything else reading the changelog for critical fixes being made and scheduling a time-critical update mostly works best. Software updates are always seen as downtime even if none is incurred so it's not always easy to convince keeping automatic security updates turned on.\nLike I said, please feel free to adapt and use my way of installing to improve any scripts or documentation. I don't really plan to be a great active contributor to the project, mainly because I have very little experience with code outside of php, so nodejs is like klingon to me.\nLastly, I have to express my gratitude for this project. I very much appreciate when there are alternatives to paid enterprise service software, especially since the clients I deal with are all small businesses that have not yet grown enough to afford them. It greatly helps as stepping stone and some seem to not want to switch away from it :). ",

Thanks. . I got wekan working with apache (with letsencrypt too)! \nBasically, created a sub-domain (board.mysite.org), and created the wekan.conf vhost file with the subdomain info, e.g. \nServerName board.mysite.org\nDocumentRoot /var/www/board.mysite.org/html\nI'm still learning about vhosts, and believe a separate .conf is used for a new (or sub) domain. \n.

The alternative approach is to manually copy/paste or type each one then hit enter which is obviously not desirable. This is a very powerful and useful feature request which would allow for many Trello users to fully adopt usage of Wekan.\nIf you require to keep the multi lines for one single checklist item, then I can understand this but I think the community would vote for the priority to be to implement this feature request as priority. \nHowever, perhaps there is a way we can maintain both by implementing this feature request as a new toggle mode switch.

This is not implemented so far, right? If possible, it would be great, but Wekan is a great piece of software already, so this is a humble feature request.. Thx for the replys! For me it would be enough to speed up the manual cleanup process like in - sorry for this probably annoying comparison - Trello. There you have the \"archive\" button on every card. Click - done and still not deleted (trash bin). In Wekan it may be only one click more, but you still have to search the right entry at the end of a long list... and you have to scroll, when the card is near the bottom of the screen. So this is mainly about usability and comfort.\nAn separate Trash-List would be workaround, but since I use all the space on the screen, the Trash list would need horizontal scrolling, and this is not so fine. And you have to move the card all the way over to the trash list.\nPerhaps a solution comes by time, I would enjoy it :). sorry for the late reply @therampagerado \na trash board would not be my solution at the moment, i would rather prefer to do the additional click then, instead of moving. but thx for the suggestion..

Could you give me an account to rocket.chat to debug this problem please ? Trial is disabled on rocket.chat currently... . Hi, \nthe problem is that identity providers (facebook, google, rocketchat) are there own data structure which is send to oauth client. \nWhen I wrote the oauth2 authentification for wekan, i used a personnal identity provider and the package salleman:accounts-oidc works for it. But if you want connect with facebook, google, etc., you have to use an other package like accounts-google for google, accounts-facebook for facebook, and accounts-rocketchat for rocket\nthen, you have to put a service configuration in server/authentification.js in replace for exemple with rocketchat : \nServiceConfiguration.configurations.upsert( // eslint-disable-line no-undef\n        { service: 'oidc' },\nby \nServiceConfiguration.configurations.upsert( // eslint-disable-line no-undef\n        { service: 'rocketchat' },\nCould you test ? . I use doorkeeper (https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper). yes, it works well :)\nNo, i think your change neigher breaks or fix anything\n. ",

Hi @xet7 \nwe\u2019ve actually tried and set up all the authentication methods offered but none meet our security requitements and cloud access and usage restrictions.\nthe 3rd party software in use is SSO siteminder\nwe have tried:\nPASSWORD & LDAP : both still have the weaknesss of possible impersonation of someone else if you get the user password\nSAML : we\u2019ve set up a sandstorm sso instance but faced issues with set up due to cloud restrictions in place as well as user experience being much less nice than wekan standalone\nCAS : is not a standard we can use\nCLOUD AUTH: all authentication that rely on web/cloud accounts (google, friend... ) are not allowed.\nwe\u2019ve tried our best with the already provided solutions hence this feature request.\n. Thank you both for your feedbacks.\nThing is that in our situation we need to navigate in a very constrained environnement and most of those are not my choice nor within reach to change.\n@xet7 we would only be able to use a) siteminder\n@yuriy-yarosh see my comments:\n\n3rd party authentication server mode\nAs long as this authentication server can comply to standardized auth API shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nUnfortunately 3rd party authentication is not made thru standard auth API. As far as the endpoint (wekan here) is concerned Authentication happens upstream and endpoint doesn't receive unauthenticated requests. The request arrives at wekan endpoint = user is authenticated. You just need to start the user context.\n\n...user information model and HTTP headers tag names ... as defined in the mapping set\nI don't think that any kind of mapping set is needed for as long as 3rd party server comply to the API contract.\n\nThe mapping is in place as there are specific custom (to our organization) headers tags set but would rather not have them hardcoded.\n. hi @xet7 that\u2019s great news. do not hesitate to reach out should you have any queries :). Hi @xet7 \nabout sandstorm the setup and grains are too much overhead for using only wekan.\nwhilste user experience in wekan is really great, it felt more complex in sandstorm. also to note that we are not interested in any of the other features currently proposed in sandstorm.\nwe have tried Oidc but could not make it work . re siteminder account not sure going for test account would be posible i\u2019ll check and revert back. it might require to be stubbed. I may ask to get some data response samples upon successful login to test.\non the http headers actually some header should map existing user data: username, first name last name.. to allow creation of user on 1st connection and then identify context (who is actually logged in). @xet7 i\u2019ll ask the person who ran the test on oidc to join the discussion ;). yes that would be the idea.\ni will share some headers data sample that would be the easiest way for you to progress with this.. one question to be crystal clear re Oidc mappings could the mapping mecanism be used even if we\u2019re not in an oidc auth mecanism but in our siteminder set up?. data we could get in headers are:\nUID (our own corporate employee identifier)\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail Address\nCountry code (not sure this one would be useful though). @xet7 one point though the authentication is not happening after the wekan endpoint is reached. \nparameters listed here suggest that once wekan is reached by user a call to authentication server is done..\nactual sequence with siteminder is:\n1- user enters wekan Url\n2- url is resolved to be protected by Siteminder and user is redirected to siteminder\n3- siteminder checks authorization\n4- siteminder redirects to wekan with added Http headers\n5- wekan can lookup the headers and trigger user session. so my guess is \u201call you might have to do\u201d is a global variable to set auth to siteminder.\nand if that then consume headers (that could be session variable too) either to start user session or to create a user on 1st connection..

When you move/copy the card to different board the card is still linking to the same customField. That customField doesn't exist in new table. The view, when trying to build itself gets all customFields for current board(which doesn't contain new field) and then tries to render cards. Because cards link to custom field which is undefined in this context the whole view crashes.\nFor now I've fixed my broken boards by removing customFields assigned to cards trough database, since I didn't have a lot of them.\nI see some solutions to fix the issue:\n1) When card is copied/moved all customFields are removed from the instance on new board\n2) When card is copied/moved we try to find customField with same name and type in new board. If it doesn't exist we create such customField. Then we update the card to link to new customField. We do it for all custom fields.\n3) We update model of customFields so they can be connected to multiple boards. When we copy/move card we check if target board has current customField and if not we add new board to customField.boardIds collection. This would mean we have to update delete customField function, so it doesn't get removed from all boards.\n4) Change the rendering methods so they don't crash if board doesn't have some customfields and just get that custom field by id.\nPersonally I think 2nd option is the safest and most consistent with how tags behave..

I saw the \"delayed scroll\" Alex131089 referred to when clicking and dragging as opposed to using the mousewheel -- as if the content of the card needed to catch-up.\nWhile testing, I happened to notice that for a very brief period after the card details load scrolling is much faster, but then quickly resets to the slower speed and the scrollbar moves back to the top (the scrollbar thumb/scrollbox also seems to shrink at this time for what it's worth).\nI'm using Firefox 64.0 snapd Wekan v2.20.0.

In other words, can Wekan automatically log-in users that have already been authenticated by the reverse proxy?\nAs a comparison, when I setup a MediaWiki server, I loaded the Extension:Auth remoteuser extension to add this functionality.

It has its own configuration and control files (especially for apache and nginx) and it uses a little different directory structure. On those systems, which are managed by Plesk you can install all kinds of regular packages e.g. Debian etc., but bundled, complex web applications. If you install those packages, the chance is very high, that you run into big trouble and may end up with a non-functioning server.\nI know, that I can install it from source, but that does not help either, because I could not find any information about e.g. database configuration/preperation and necessary systemd/cron task etc.\nI am not a programmer so I do not want to dig into the code to find out all these things to make Wekan work properly.\nI hope I could make my position a little clearer.\n.
