Just thought I would give you a heads' up if you were going to check out the VFS (some minor changes also, but for the better)\n. @RyanRiffle I have created a simple parser for the code documentation. Not anywhere near finished, but it's a good start. What do you think ? :)\nhttp://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/documentation/\n. @RyanRiffle Yeah. It really does make a huge difference! \nI just uploaded the latest generation of docs, so check it out tomorrow. It looks a bit better now and texts should be a lot clearer :smile:\nSame here, man.

Closing the issue because most of this is now mostly automated and taken care of (Except maybe the servers, but they use the same HTTP methods and that is all documented)\n. Reopened because I'm rewriting documentation into JSDoc and completely ditching the custom system\n. Seeing now that all the old documentation has been converted 100%; I'm closing this issue again. It went a lot faster than first estimated. Any more updates will be made silently by commits :)\n. I'm closing this for now and splitting up into a separate issue later\n. @MrSchism Awesome :+1: \n.

Merged with #18\n. @MrSchism With the Writer app I was thinking of making it look like you type in on actual paper (like in MS Word and the likes with rulers and all that)\nI'm not sure about the Music Player. Suggestions are very welcome!\n. @MrSchism Yeah, I saw Ventus some time ago.\nI actually made a shell for the previous OS.js version that worked pretty well, but the code was pretty bad. Terminusjs seems really nice and could be included for sure. Maybe I should create a tutorial on how I would go ahead and do it ? That could be a nice reference for anyone that wants to get started on app development. The new homepage could really use some details and extensive documentation.\nI have been thinking about including something like this for a while, but have not settled for how I want it. There are some other very awesome JS terminal libraries out there that can actually do real SSH connections with streaming and full color support and all that jazz.\n. @MrSchism \nFor example this one: https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne\n\nPersonally, I'd be happy with an extremely limited set of commands.\n\nThe commands in this case will be a wrapper for the API functions\n\nPersonally, I'd be happy with an extremely limited set of commands. \n\nThat is nothing to worry about. Nothing will slow down even if there was a million of them :)\nAnd about the security, the only place where this can be of a concern is the Virtual Filesystem (for example if they break out of the system and read/modify system files). The nice thing here is that the server handles this and should detect any malicious attempts and block them (depending on configurations)\n. This issue is pretty much deprecated. The rest of the TODOs is noted in #49\n. Fixed for GUIRichtext (somewhat). This issue can be reopened if this is a problem later\n. Should not be a problem anymore.

Thanks!\nAs a side-node, I've updated the \"description\" in the metadata files to be a bit more descriptive, so maybe you can look at that ?\nAlso, I've updated the manual about translating packages:\nhttps://manual.os-js.org/v3/guide/translate/. @filips123 Nice :)\nSee:\n\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-client/tree/master/src/locale\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-panels/blob/master/src/locales.js\nThe metadata.json files in the applications + themes\n. @filips123 I can't seem to remove the milestone. A bug in the Github UI or something :laughing: . @OlivieBright \n\nSee https://manual.os-js.org/v3/guide/translate/ for a guide on how translation works.\nThen look at https://manual.os-js.org/v3/resource/official/ for a list of core modules and applications that can be translated (almost all of them have localization in them). @filips123 Yeah. I'm planning on making a routine script that pulls all the diffs for locale changes and posts them here every two weeks or something.. @filips123 I've updated the top comment to contain a list of packages which have translations of their own. I'll see if I can't get this automated script running before newyears.. @BoFFire Hi!\nNice! Translations are always welcome :)\nInstructions are in the top comment.

However, it can read JSON files -- so maybe the .js should be converted to that instead. Not sure yet... Looking at some alternatives first.. @nijel Thanks. In this case my .js files basically just are flat JSON so I'll look into converting it. \n\n@filips123 Yup. I was reading on i18next when I was browsing the Weblate documentation. Seems like it should be pretty trivial to make use of that :). @filips123 I'm now actually contemplating adding support for callbacks in the localization that OS.js uses so that it is possible to perform all kinds of actions to any given translation. Example:\n```javascript\nconst some_LANGUAGE = {\n  // _('COUNT_FLAT', 0)\n  COUNT_FLAT: 'Showing {0} object(s)',\n// _('COUNT_OBJECT', {count: 0})\n  COUNT_OBJECT: 'Showing {count} object(s)',\n// _('COUNT_DYNAMIC_FLAT', 0)\n  COUNT_DYNAMIC_FLAT: (count) => count === 1\n    ? Showing ${count} object, \n    : Showing ${count} objects,\n// _('COUNT_DYNAMIC_OBJECT', {count: 0})\n  COUNT_DYNAMIC_OBJECT: ({count}) => count === 1\n    ? Showing ${count} object, \n    : Showing ${count} objects\n};\n```\nThis of course won't make it possible to make any of the ready solutions discussed for managing translations (unless you can write support via plugins), but it will make it very easy to implement proper plurals, formatting, interpolations etc. into the current system without introducing any overhead (most of the localization libraries are 20%+ the total size of the OS.js client codebase).\nThoughts ? :)\nEdit\nJust adding to this, that we can still make some sort of online interface for checking the state of things, because what we mostly care about here is the actual keys. The values of these can also be diffed by using git -- so if any of the actual texts have been changed, this could be detected.\nAs for an online interface, I was just thinking of throwing together something quick somewhat based on what I've already done.\nEdit Fixed example. Just an addition to my latest comment I'm prototyping an interface here: https://codepen.io/andersevenrud/pen/PXQRNe. @filips123 Yup, good points.. @filips123 \n\nKeys are displayed in table with columns \"Key\", \"Translation\". What is this \"Translation\" column. If i is for adding translations, it should probably not be there because translations should be added with editing files (editing from UI would probably be very hard to implement). \n\nYes, the translation column was intended for entering a translation. The idea here was that it maybe could be possible to generate code you could copy/paste into the actual sources.\n\nAlso, there sould be column \"Original\" with link to original translation in English or even direct value of it.\n\nThe latter was what I was thinking, with some sort of indication with colors or something.\n\nThis is good, but it is still not so easy to navigate between them.\n\nHaven't really though of this yet, but just using dropdowns might suffice ? [ package ] [ language ]\n\nIf possible, languages should be named like \"Language name (language-code)\".\n\nCan just use some JSON dump found online.\n\nThere are some libraries for localisation (also for language naming, pluralisation, numbering, displaying dates) but they are probably very heavy. Maybe you can look to some of them and \"extract\" only functions that are needed here.\n\nYes, this has been discussed above. Dates is already covered, so the main part missing here is proper pluralization.\nThis can be solved in many ways, but using the suggestions I've made above there won't be any need tor an existing library (and you get more than pluralization to boot), but it's now no longer plain text. I guess this could be solved with some custom string format though...\nAs for which direction to go, I'm not 100% sure yet.\n. @filips123 \nIf you're up for some UI prototyping and have some time to kill, feel free to have a look at the UI stuff :). @filips123 Doesn't have to be Hyperapp. I just went for that because it's easy to prototype stuff with it.\nAs for backend, it's not really required i think. We can just generate a JSON with all of the data and statistics from the repositories -- so some batch job or something.. Replaced with #136\n. Awesome! Thanks :)\n. Thanks a lot!\n. @spleen387 Great :)\n. @ymski So what did you find ? :)\n. @ymski How do I get in contact with you and the findings you have ? :)\n. @CtrlC-Root I'll look into Vagrant. Thnx :)\n. It seems to be very hard to recruit testers, but now I have a couple that are willing to do it. So that should suffice for now :) This issue is taking up unwanted space, so I'm going to close it. It does not make much sense to have it open anyway, since most people contact me via mail.\n. I am closing this simply because it has no activity and most of this happens on external sources that are not logged here.\n. @Fabel, @emersion if you have any home-page or something like that you would like to refer to, please update this wiki article :)\n. This is great. Thank you so much! :D\n. This is now included as default module in OS.js but will require to manually set up dropbox-js (it is very simple)\n. Closed for now :)\n. Dropbox v2 support coming in upcoming v2.1.1 release.. After looking at the GTK sources this seems to be way easier then first expected. I will cointinue experimenting with this, including writing an entirely new library that is modular and customizable (the sources from GTK is quite ugly)\n. @emersion I'm planning to make something very portable and easy to update. From the looks of it is very simple and most of the changes could be an automated process (parsing .h files) \n. @emersion I will have something to show off later today :)\n. @emersion Created first prototype of the new library. See the link in main description :)\nStarted on Event handling now. After that it's just a matter of cleaning up and making it as portable as possible\n. @emersion Btw. I was looking at the history of broadway.js and it seems that it does not change that often (if ever), so the protocol will most likely not receive any huge changes :)\n. @emersion I have done something like this before using PAM logins and a simple messaging system. Btw I have made some great progress on the implementation. Just pushed a few nice updates :D\n. @emersion I have now implemented a spawner for processes... not finished mind you, and not pretty at the moment, but works :) Code is in Broadway/vendor\nPreview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0QLC9Sx-BA\n. @davelab6 It's currently working of the \"old\" GTK implementation, but should work just fine. I am in the middle of writing a new encoder to support latest features!\n. @RyanRiffle The plan (I have not thought to much about this myself) was to hook into the PAM authentication system to spawn a X-server and not a OS.js server for the requested user. Right now it just attaches to the specified server which has to be started manually (or just :0 which is the default one). I'll get back to you with some more in-depth info when I'm home again (holiday atm). Did this help ? :)\n. @RyanRiffle, yeah, that's pretty much how it works now. So just need a\nspawner of sorts to automate that process.\nAnd when it comes to permissions, that's comes entirely down to how both\nthe system and user is configured :)\nOn Sat, Aug 6, 2016 at 1:21 AM, Ryan Riffle notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThat helps.

Evenrud\nSoftware Developer\nBlog: http://tinyurl.com/cjfrfx8\n. I've pused an update that adds support for Broadway library version 2.0. Along with these changes:\n\nNow runs as a \"service\" on the OS.js server (no manual launching required)\nNow has connection settings from configuration files\nSupports maximize/restore of windows\nMuch better input handling\nPerformance improvements and bugfixes\n\nhttps://os.js.org/manual/client/broadway/. Firefox crashes, sadly (worked in some other version), and there's not many [full] Gtk 3.0+ applications yet included in ex. Ubuntu. I'm going to make a curated list of supported apps and see if I find a way to run apps that crash.\nEverything seems to work fine with apps that are fully GTK3 compatible. Example:\nhttps://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WjOID6FcjbjqBtB5byiR0OLJN6-_DEk8LjOmR-vFlrVOGw54BjN97BiocN968lj6LdKis3LqPMfVTJ8=w1920-h1110-rw. This is no longer a thing, sadly. But theres awesome news: Xpra replaces this entirely (and is actually based on Broadway).\nA fully working repository for this is here: https://github.com/os-js/osjs-xpra\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0safRR0ldM&list=PL74DE0E481419C259&index=16. @osmarks AFAIK Broadway is no longer in development (the actual protocol etc.), however, I'm working on an Xpra client which does the same thing :smile: \n\nOS.js Integration: https://github.com/os-js/osjs-xpra-application\nLibrary code: https://github.com/andersevenrud/xpra-html5-client. @osmarks I'm actually working on rewriting some of the parts to WebAssembly (using Rust) for waaaay better performance.. Excellent! Thanks :)\n. Just found out that setting width on flex containers do not work. Proper way is flex: <arg> <arg> <dimension>px\n. @RyanRiffle I was thinking of ws, but have not decided yet. From what I can gather this is the fastest and slimmest module of them all. It lacks support for fallback, but in this case it does not matter. I have tried quite a few of the alternatives, and Socket.IO is the second in my list... unless someone convinces me otherwise ;)\n. @RyanRiffle That was the fallback i was talking about. In this case it does not matter because OS.js will always use the appropriate one. (API::call() is the abstraction function which will detect based on configuration and/or compability depending on how the user built OS.js)\n. @RyanRiffle I was not very clear on that... API::call() is the function which is called everywhere in the code to communicate with the server process. This function is abstract and will use the connection method that has been configured by the deployer. The configuration supports: ajax, websocket and automatic\n. @RyanRiffle The main reason I'm looking at ws is that it looks to be really lightweight and will not introduce anything redundant. I already have a AJAX-connection handler and I really just need a raw websocket implementation. I do not care about support for older browsers and client libraries (which is mostly used because of backward compability) so this seems like a good choice.\n. @RyanRiffle No worries. I appreciate the input. It has been hard to get any input from the public; and to start a discussion is even harder. So, if you have anything on your mind about this project let me hear it :) If you have any questions at all regarding how OS.js works on a low level (like exactly this) i just opened up issue #49\n. Merging with #11\n. LESS is being used by the themes. This makes it way easier to manage colors etc :)\n\nI think I will stick with regular CSS for the core stuff because it never changes and just contains some very basic stuff.\n. @CtrlC-Root Would be cool to have the choice. Somebody actually wrote a Go version of my API, but have not had the time to test it and commit into master. The server is devided into these parts:\n- Core API: By default empty, but can be extended with a login manager etc (included as example)\n- Application API: Basically just a Ajax/Websocket/whatever wrapper for making async requests. Very simple\n- Filesystem API: Wrapper for file handling on various resources\nIf you're into python and have the time, please do have a look at it :)\n. @CtrlC-Root No, not everything. It's devided into two parts: Client (only JavaScript, no 3rd party stuff) and Server (Your choice: PHP, Nodejs and maybe more to come)\n. @CtrlC-Root There's not much documentation for the server stuff yet, but the code should be fairly easy to understand. As I said earlier, it is a very simple codebase; since it's mostly just wrappers. If you have any questions at all, just ask me -- and use this Issue if related :)\n. @MrSchism Indeed\n. @christopherdumas Why was PHP a bad choice ?\n. @christopherdumas That was not a very satisfying answer. You seem to be thinking of the PHP of the past... it has grown very mature and has become quite powerful. Are you a developer working with PHP btw? Because I would really like to know why and not just \"PHP is X\". It really gets to me :P\n. @CtrlC-Root Actually, \"we\" can provide any backend we want. I let people do whatever they want here (it's open after all). If it does not make much sence to include it in the main git-repo, one could always set up a standalone repo for the backend and keep it completely separated (github is awesome this way).... Everyone is happy!\n. @christopherdumas I was thinking more about your own opinion, but oh well. The quote you found is from a blog article named \"PHP: A fractal of bad design\"... and I could go and look up some articles and paste in quotes that comes from the opposite perspective, but I won't do that... this is way out of topic as is.\n. That is exactly why we have all the flavours and languages... you pick what is best for the job. And PHP does it just fine in most cases if you have a competent developer.\n. Haskell is pretty nice. Just recently got into it because of something at work\n. @christopherdumas No worries\n. @CtrlC-Root I've started on the documentation of the server-side of OS.js. If there is anything you would like to see in there (like if you have any questions, that would be great) -- let me know! :smile:\nhttp://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/doc/server/\n. @CtrlC-Root \n1) You don't configure it, you start your server of choice (see INSTALL.md \"Setting up a server\" section)\n2) Now that I have documented the basic communication between Client and Server, an educated guess should do it. (The only docs missing is the VFS functions actually).\nBut I feel the current documentation is not dense enough and a bit unclear (It was so friggin late when I wrote that). So if you have any questions at all, just send them my way so I can improve the docs.\nThe best way to get an understanding of how this works is simply to use the Network tools in the browser. Just filter the \"XHR\" requests and look at the request/response headers :)\n. @CtrlC-Root Just updated the page with a bit more information ;)\n. @CtrlC-Root I am closing this issue because of a cleanup. If you're still working on this; let me know and I will open it again :)\n. Thanks, mate :) I'll move the TESTING.md to doc/vargant.md because that filename is mostly used for unit testing etc. and I will probably include this at some point.\n. Also, I updated the vargant documentation file. Take a look and (maybe you want the text changed).\nBasically you don't need to clone OS.js just to do vargant, you only need the Vargantfile -- so I just added this notice in the file.\n. Also added a Vargant section to INSTALL.md :)\n. @Mstrodl Thanks for reporting!\nSeems like I made a mistake last month in the update, which has now been corrected :)\n. Closing this issue because it will be separated into https://github.com/os-js/osjs-google-vfs when v3 comes along.. I will close this for now. I don't want to implement any kind of encoding detection or transcoding/decoding etc. So... yeah!\n. @taigrr In this case the request is just getting proxied by the HTTP-request library OS.js provides, so it's not something that stops things from working...it's just a bit annoying since it adds a bit of an overhead (2 or more HTTP requests and data has to be piped through the server OS.js is running on).\nThanks for reminding me about this though. They must have released a new version of the API now that supports what I was working around :). Closing this issue because it will be separated into https://github.com/os-js/osjs-onedrive-vfs when v3 comes along.. @RyanRiffle That looks awesome! Gotta go to bed now, but I will clone this tomorrow and have a go at it :)\n. @RyanRiffle  I've had a quick look at this (source-code).\nTo make this fit into OS.js the \"right way\" one would have to:\n- Make it possible to hook in custom functions for loading/saving files (XHR)\n- Detach toolbar from the editor and use OS.js provided GUI and add appropriate callbacks\n- Remove global onload handler and instead provide (ex) Poe.init() instead\n- Also customizing of font list, possibly via Pos.init() as described above\nThoughts ?\n. @RyanRiffle \n\nOpening and loading of files is still something that needs to be done almost completely in Poe, so loading/saving is still open for any kind of setup.\n\nGood. OS.js has internal methods for handling this and it would be best to do it this way (think saving on the cloud etc)\n\nThe toolbar should be easy to move over, since all it does is hook up the buttons to simple functions that use Poe.TextCursor to modify the document. I am just curious about how it would work out since the toolbar is dynamic.\n\nDynamic toolbars is no problem if it is possible to provide the appropriate messaging and callback functions :)\n\nFonts however I am wondering. Poe.FontManager could be refactored to just accept font-family names instead of loading the actual font file, the same way OS.js does (if that is right).\n\nThis is correct, OS.js just has a list of web-fonts by name. It can also refer to custom fonts, but all the magic is in CSS's @font-face. Would be nice to have it something like this:\nPoe.init({\n   fontList: ['Array', 'of', 'names'],\n   fontPath: '/path/to/fonts',\n   fontLoader: function() {} //  A custom hook for you to load fonts via XHR etc\n});\nif no fontList or path etc. is given Poe could just fall back to its internal modules. \n\nThe problem is that Poe is written in coffeescript, not js. That requires yet another dependency, or convert it to javascript either by rewriting or coffee2js. Any thoughts on whether porting would be necessary?\n\nDependencies are no problem. I like to put packages like these in the extras repository. Many may actually prefer this to plain js, so I don't think you should port it or anything like that.\n. @RyanRiffle ops. A tiny mistake in the last code example. Correction:\nPoe.init({\n   fontList: [{\n     name: 'Sans-serif',\n     filename: 'sans-serif.ttf'\n   }, {\n     name: 'Droid Sans', \n     filename: 'relative-path/droid_sans.ttf'\n   }],\n   fontPath: '/path/to/fonts',\n   fontLoader: function() {} //  A custom hook for you to load fonts via XHR etc\n});\n. @RyanRiffle Thanks for that comment. I seem to never have had any use for that, but it is pretty obvoius someone else would. Pull the latest changes and you will be ready to go\n```\nInside a method in your window, ex the init() function\nthis._addHook('moved', function() {\n  // Window has moved\n});\nAnd this\nvar idx = this._getZindex();\n``\n. @RyanRiffle If you used./obt create-package Poeyou should have a template ready for use insrc/packages/Poewith all you need\n. @RyanRiffle Nice. If you have any comments or suggestions on the application creation part of things feel free to leave them in #49. I know stuff is lacking in the documentation department, but looking at other applications might give you an idea. Also, if you look at fex. _Textpad_: that application uses the helper classDefaultApplication(src/helpers/default-application.js) as it's base instead of the defaultApplication`. DefaultApplication contains some nice methods for easily saving/loading files\n. @RyanRiffle Cool. Looking forward to that :smile:\n. @RyanRiffle Sure thing, man :)\n. I am closing this issue for now because of inactivity.\nSadly, I don't think I have any time to spare on Poe :/\n. Merged with #49\n. utuxia on reddit sendt me this one\n\nDoes anyone else see the \"line\" (artefact) ?\n. A guy at work made this for me. I think it looks teh balls!\n\n\nSources is in the repo -- just commited!\n. @MrSchism That is a very good idea. Thanks :+1: \n. @MrSchism It has now been added. I might have to experiment with the colors to make it contrast nicely with the panel :smile:\n. @MrSchism The homepage has also been updated. Check it out! :)\nhttp://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/\n. @MrSchism Something like that may work. I'll look more at it tomorrow :)\n. Closing for now. If something else arrives, I will reopen\n. @RyanRiffle It's pretty simple. You have:\n- src/javascript The thing you load in your browser. Split up into appropriate subfolders \n- src/server-php PHP Server implementation\n- src/server-node Node Server implementation\nThe server part of OS.js is extremely simple. You pretty much just have to serve the css and js files and have support for calling some sort of API. In this case it is VFS (filesystem functions), Core (like login, logout, etc) and Application (applications have isolated APIs).\nThe server API is built so you can basically plug-in your own functions. Example (pseudo-code):\n```\nServer code\nAPI::addHandler('MyFunction', callback);\n```\n```\nFrontend code\nAPI::call('MyFunction', args, callback);\n``\n.  @RyanRiffle To further go into _serving files_. Currently OS.js does this with HTTP, including the Virtual File System (downloading and uploading of files in browser. Like using REST). This is probably completely obvious since it's served via HTML, but I thought I should mention it.\n. @RyanRiffle In case you have not figured it out, look at [this](https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/wiki/Installation-and-Configuration#building-and-distributions) wiki document that explains the difference between thedistdirectories. Usingdist-dev` is pretty much required if you're going in there with a debugger in your browser to get a feel of things.\nLooking forward to any questions you might have :sweat_smile: \n. @RyanRiffle All of the above :) It has a pretty long history but has evolved to do all of this. After the introduction of Broadway (#29) you can run this as an X11 environment or even use it as remote desktop in your browser (ala VNC). Not to toot my own horn, but I think that is pretty cool.\n. @RyanRiffle I wrote VLC in the last comment, but I meant VNC (corrected). This is something I started experimenting with as a teenager (IE5. shudders), but browser tech was not just there yet. So for me; this is pretty exiting too! Just take your time -- I'll be here (unless death himself has me on his list) :smile: \n. @RyanRiffle Actually, you can add whatever you want to the toolbar. Again... my bad on the documentation here.\n```\nvar self = this;\ntoolbar.addItem('Name', {\ntype: 'custom',\n  onCreate: function(toolbarRef, itemName, itemOptions, outerEl, containerEl) {\n // Here you can add DOM elements to `containerEl` \n // Or just OS.js GUI Elements\n self._addGUIElement(new GUI.Select(...), containerEl);\n\n}\n});\n```\n. @RyanRiffle Thank you for this. So many people have contacted me saying they want to (and will) create some apps, but then it goes totally silent. Either my code is too scary, ugly or way to undocumented. AFAIK I'm using relatively well known JS patterns and try to be as explicit as possible. It may be a combination of all the above :p Getting to my point: This really helps me make changes that makes approacing OS.js easier.\n. @RyanRiffle Basically, there is none. I want to wait unti I have gotten some feedback so I can solidify the API and base code. I don't like re-writing docs -- it's a mess (Frequently occurs at work)! \nI have not desided what generator to use yet. To be honest, I don't like any of the ones I have tried. If you know of a good one, let me know. In the past I have just rolled my own. \n. @RyanRiffle I just commited some docu for 'core.js'. If you look at it I have added some very simple comments that I can easily prase with a script. I might go that way\n. @RyanRiffle You probably know this, but to get an overview over the entire API, just open your JavaScript console in the browser and type in \"OSjs\" and press enter. From there you can see the entire API tree. When you enter a class just expand the \"prototype\" leaf to see all the class methods\n. @RyanRiffle Not sure I understand. GUI.Select.setValue() ?\n. I am not using the DOM attribute, but rather \"selectedIndex\" property. Example code:\nselect.addItem(\"myvalue\", \"My Label\");\nselect.setValue(\"myvalue\");\nvar val = select.getValue(); // == \"myvalue\"\n. Maybe it is because it has not been added to DOM at that moment? Kinda puzzled here.\nTry:\n@fontSelect = window._addGUIElement(new OSjs.GUI.Select(\"FontSelect\", {onChange: @fontSelectClicked}), parentDOMElement);\n. Where window is a OS.js Windows and not the global\n. How does it look inside of the <select>. Does it have <option>s ?\n. I'm going to try this for myself now. Hang on!\n. Lol. It's because the outer container for GUISelect is too small.\nMy test:\n```\n var select;\n var toolbar = this._addGUIElement(new GUI.ToolBar('TestToolbar'), root);\n toolbar.addItem('CustomItem', {\n   type: 'custom',\n   onCreate: function(itemName, itemOptions, outerEl, containerEl) {\n     select = self._addGUIElement(new GUI.Select('TestSelect'), containerEl);\n     select.addItem('foo', 'Foo');\n     select.addItem('bar', 'Bar');\n  }\n});\ntoolbar.render();\n\n```\nAnd then in CSS\n.Window_ApplicationsupertestWindow  .GUISelect.TestSelect {\n  width : 100px;\n}\n. I should maybe enforce some rules on minimum sizes of all GUI Elements\n. @PewienTyp Sure. I can do that :smile: Just opened an issue for this: #61\n. Maybe a bug ? Sounds like a memory leak! I had similar problems with semalt.com in Linux/Chromium!\n. Chrome bug I mean\n. @PewienTyp Just tested latest Chromium on Ubuntu 14. No problems here :/\n. @PewienTyp Yeah. I've experienced something similar a couple of times, but never found out why. To me it feels like a memory leak or a corruption caused by Webkit (this one time everything just froze and a buzzing sound came out of my speakers... like when a game crashes). If it occurs again, maybe you could take a look in syslog to see if any errors occured and paste it here ? Just if you can and want to, that is :)\n. @PewienTyp Thanks! Created new issue: #64\n. @PewienTyp Yes. There is an example included for this :smile:\nsrc/javascript/handlers/example/handler.js\nsrc/server-php/handlers/example/handler.php\ndoc/example-handler.txt\nhttp://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/doc/tutorials/create-handler.html\n. @PewienTyp Ops. I had not pushed the latest changes to the tutorial. It has been updated\nhttp://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/doc/tutorials/create-handler.html\n. @PewienTyp You can enable desktop icon view in Settings. This supports dragging files etc. into it to create shortcuts. Come to think of it I should enable it by default (which I just did in latest commit).\nYou can snap windows to corners using keyboard shortcuts ALT + ARROW-KEYS, but I can add support for it with movment: issue #68\n. @PewienTyp At the moment they are not. I will add this on the TODO list for the future.\n. @MrSchism \n\nCould not reproduce the memory leak.\n\nYeah. This can either be a deep bug in webkit or simply a memory corruption. Fun fact: Cosmic radiation can actually cause bugs like these :P\n. @PewienTyp Sure. This could be implemented somewhat easily. I-ll add it to the list :)\n. @livep2000 I don't think anyone has run it on nginx yet, at least nobody has provided a config file for this.,\n.  @livep2000 Latest commit 54edb1488c88847f464b7fa33be40b99029b79c4 now has nginx configuration included.\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/INSTALL.md#php5-on-nginx\n. > Wow, youre fast.\nThat's what she said ;) (I have very bad taste in jokes... sorry!)\nBut yeah, I do a shitload of server/VMs and web stuff at work, so I know my way around :)\n. @khoaakt \n\nShortcuts\n\nThis can be solved easily. Adding to the list\n\nDesktop Workspace\n\nI already have this in a branch, but not tested yet. Will look more into it (already on list)\n\nshow date in bar\n\nIt really should be configurable.\n\nTouch Menu \n\nAlready there. Check the Settings application :)\n. @livep2000\nI have now moved user installed packages to home:///.packages. Pull the latest commit and do gunt config, then regenerate metadata in settings application.\nI have also added a toggle to FileManager so you can show/hide them (by default FileManager will not show them), however File dialogs will! I will add this as a global setting soon :)\n. @livep2000 \nYou can read more about dotfiles here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory :)\n\nFound a simple and logical solution for a custom 'market place'.\nA subfolder in public, with readonly for nxing.....\n\nNot exactly sure what you mean by this. \n. > Well, to provide packages publically.\nLike, shared between all users ? I think adding some sort of $PATH global variable is a better way to do it. Just like every OS does... so you can define what paths have \"executables\".\nBecause of potential security issues I will not however be adding the public storage path there. Imagine someone installs a public package designed to hijack let's say an application you have to enter your password into. It can potentially steal this kind of information.\n\nBeceause i use nginx it has read-write permissions for nginx.\n\nSetting permissions in via the server configurations is not a good solution since you'd have to write the rules for all the setups. Also you have to rewrite them if you move something around.\n\nBy setting that (sub) folder read only (in linux), the api.php cannot change files.\n\nBut then again you cannot install applications into here. You'd have to turn on/off the read-only flag which defeats the purpose.\n. Oh. You were thinking about actually hosting all the apps in a live OS.js environment ?\nI have completely other plans for that. More specifically a separate web API running on another host. Hence the name \"App Store\" or \"Marketplace\" (think: service).\nBut nothing is stopping you from doing it this way.\n. > Oh. You were thinking about actually hosting all the apps in a live OS.js environment ?\npackages, not apps. Sorry\n. This is why I started on the \"App Store\". See: \n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/issues/99\nAnd also:\n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/wiki/Package-Repositories\nBut, you could do it in the way you just described. Everything is in place for that. That is mostly why I do not understand you. Is there something you need ?!\n. Commit 6cfb499fad338d234ba83cab34ea338ea89178f5 Introduced application launchers on desktop. Simply drag an application from the menu on to the desktop (with iconview enabled)\n. @rubengc I actually thought of this back in the days, but never actually got any further than that. I really like the example of the window in http://papyros.io/ . Something like that would definately be possible with the current theme system.\nI also want to implement some sort of unified desktop that behaves more like tablet/phone experience that Google and Apple has, but I [personally] feel this have to wait until all the core features have been completed (primarily the touch support and compability)\n. @junland That looks interesting. Thanks for the tip!\n\nAlso one feature I don't see is a login page.\n\nYou mean for OS.js ? \n. @junland There is one actually. One concept in OS.js is the implementation of handlers. The default handler is the \"demo\" handler which stores user settings in the browser and does not have a login screen. All sessions are basically one user for demonstration and general development purposes.\nAnother handler is supplied called \"example\" which does have a login screen and stores user settings in a database (server-side), but is not the default one. It is called \"example\" simply because I have not had any time to make something proper (I work on this alone), but I assure you this handler works fine.\nTL;DR: There actually is one, but kind of obscured by its name and the fact I have not found any time to finish it 100% (but it works fine).\nMore info here: http://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/create-handler.html\n. @rubengc I have started on a draft for the Materials implementation. It actually looks kinda good. WIll get back to you tomorrow when I have a screenshot ;)\n. @rubengc That might be best :) At least I got to do some experimentation. I also got to do some work on the new theme implementation (FYI. Just making better lessc stylesheets, not any changes in DOM).\n\n. @junland Doing something with https://github.com/chjj/tty.js would be interesting since it has full vt100 support.\n. @junland  I am very familiar with that project and have actually done some contributions :) The problem Symbiose is that it's overy-complex and has way to many points of failure (if you look at the latest issues you can see there is some fundamental problems there). Other than that I really like it.\nThe patters, filetree, APIs, etc. are completely different... so that means doing some rewrites to the apps, to be able to use Dialogs, Filesystems, GUI and all that. It uses jQuery to actually build the DOM, but it also depends on lot of other stuff that would require separation from the core.\nMaybe later I can do a compability layer or something for stuff exactly like this (just like with Firefox Marketplace stuff).\nI would really love to be able to pull the apps from there, but I don't have the time (would save me massive amounts of time... and make beta come way faster). Maybe you have time to look at it ?\nI have actually got a working Terminal here that I've been experimenting with. Maybe I should clean it up and add it? \n. > Yea I'm looking through it now to see if I can find that, at least we can pull that dock from there.\nIt would be nice to separate one spesific application, then try to figure out the dependency tree of it (like, which namespaces and libraries are used). I would like to see that. One can immediately see what kind of job lies ahead.\n\nIf you want, I'm more concerned that if we add it, that may introduce more bugs that we would have to spend more time on. But that's up to you. :)\n\nThere would be no new additions to the core, so bugs will not happen. Applications are isolated entirely from the rest of OS.js... so it's considered \"safe\" to make adjustments and additions there :)\n. @junland \n\nOr some really good documentation lol\n\nThere is no documentation, except for some of the basic setup and API usage AFAIK. I have not seen any fundamentals or stuff like that (github wiki). But if you find something, let me know.\n. @junland You just write a module and add it to src/conf/200-compile.json (then rebuild). Example: https://gist.github.com/andersevenrud/c2e84548a3c0af8c7150\n. @junland \n\nIs there another way to build / write apps?\n\nYes, there is :) http://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/create-application.html\n\nAlso I can do the logic, but design wise it seems cumber sum when you don't have a preview of the Windows already available to you.\n\nI have an Interface Designer in the works (almost ready) :)\nI usually just open my app, quit and save session, then reload page (F5). Just make sure that sounds are disabled or I will go insane.\nI realise this can be a bit hard at the moment... the thing is, I write code for an hour or two, and then test it in the browser........ so getting this IDE/Interface Designer going will be good for newcomers (and those not as extreme as me).\n\nOn another note, since we can use Broadway do you know if the server uses the GPU to render GTK apps or is just rendered client side?\n\nBroadway is running completely separate from OS.js. It works almost like VNC (Remote Desktop). If the X server is running on a physical monitor it will also use a bit of GPU power. The nice thing about X is that you don't need to run it on a GPU or monitor  :)\n. @junland \n\nYup already looked over that, it's just seems like alot I guess. Or maybe it's just becuase I'm lazy\nYea, I do that too but like I said I'm a little lazy and I always think of others who are trying to write apps that don't have the patience / time / expertise to write apps. lol.\n\nWell, I've tried to make it as easy as possible. The entire API is fully documented... so for a somewhat seasoned programmer it should not be a problem getting going.\nI also realise that people are different and might not have the patince or have a whole different perspective on programming... It all boils down to that I am working alone on this and I simply do not have the time nor resources to cater to a broader audience.\nThe Interface Designer will for sure make it easier to get going. It will basically just create a JSON file from which an application builds itself upon launch (just like Glade Interface Designer for GTK. Actually OS.js v1 made use of Glade!)\nAnd on a side-note. I have been working/thinking on \"OS.js\" (as a project in total) for a decade now, so putting myself in someone elses shoes simply does not work :P\nBut, hey. That is the reason this is open-source! Comments like these are priceless and really helps me get some perspective on things. And if you find anything in the docs that are unclear or you'd want to see simplified etc. Let me know! I can open-source my documentation generation (which I also wrote myself... I am a bit crazy) and make it editable by the community!\n\nAlso I'm working on a docker files so that should be pulled in through a link to the repo or just the docker build file.\n\nWould be sweet to have Docker deployment. I already provide Vagrant (thanks to a github user). Diversity is nice :)\n. @junland All of this made me think... I got an idea here.\nIf I make an \"developer service\" (that runs in the background) that will show up as an icon in the panel. This icon has these options:\n- Reload metadata (read new applications and metadata changes)\n- Clear preloader cache (javascript files are only loaded ONCE... but with this you can reload them upon request)\n- Reload application (with a submenu that displays list of applications)\n- Watch application (same menu as above, but use VFS to detect file-changes and reload application automatically)\n. @junland \n\nInteresting, Why not feed it through a Server Side API command instead of a button? Maybe both?\n\nThat was the intention behind the thing. You for example launch your newly created application (you made with grunt create-package:MyApplicationName), click the panel icon and select \"watch application\". Then anytime you change your code (or recompile. this all happens server), the client will detect the change and reload the app (within a certain threshold).\nBasically patching (detect a change and reload).\nThis way anything you do will instantly update in the browser (assuming you made no changes to the core).\n. @junland The \"Developer Service\" will be developed in #133\n. @junland I've been so busy with all sorts of things so it did not even cross my mind. Sweet :)\n. @junland Yeah. It is pretty cool :) There is still a bit of confusion (it seems) around how all of this works however. Hope we can sort that out!\n. @IngwiePhoenix \nThat's a mighty fine list you have. Thanks a lot! :)\n\nThats all, for now. :) I know it is in alpha stages, so I will not build anything ontop of it just now, but I definitively will. :)\n\nIf everything goes as planned and I have some time to complete the critical stuff (or if suddenly some sort of holy deity sent me some help) you can start coding/hacking this fall.\n\nOSjs uses PHP or NodeJS as a server, yet they seem differently laid out. Why did you choose to support two different servers? And, which one do you see more beneficial?\n\nThis is something that came over from the previous version. Turns out a lot of people are using webhosts without Node support. So this way I cover everyone.\nThey both behave exactly the same\n\nam already hosting a site. But for working with my staff, I wanted to use OSjs to build an application, so we can share files, co-work on files and alike. Is it possible to take login strategies from another site and implement it in OSjs?\n\nYou can do this. OS.js works just like a normal web-site. So you can make a SSO or carry over auth from another site just fine. Ask if you want help :)\n\nHave you ever looked at WebPack as a distribution solution for the client?\n\nNope. So far only simple stuff with Grunt.\n\nIs there any real-time communication with the server (i.e. WebSockets)?\n\nI have a WebSocket module, but it is not in master yet. #11\n\nIs an application bound to only serve client files, or can it also be a server-client application?\n\nYou can easily do a server-client app. http://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/application-with-server-api.html\nI just noticed this doc is slightly outdated. I will fix it today\n\nLay out the client and server code into two distinct folders. It got me confused at first for where the client and where the server code is.\n\nThat's a first, but I can totally see that. I'll add this to the list :)\n\nUse a Gitter chatroom to exchange information and run a discussion. That can avoid issue-floods, too. :)\n\nI've seen Glitter used around. I'll look more into it !\n\nAllow the user to specify DB login, database and password. I dont know about the nodejs server, but the PHP server seemed to have this hardcoded.\n\nYou mean the \"example\" handler ? I actually have noted that in the FAQ in the issue description. Long story short: I have very limited time to work on this and have yet to complete an official login module.\n\nCreate a DB abstraction layer, to allow multiple backends. For instance, I might switch from MySQL to Crate - but I would like to carry over the OSjs data. It has a PDO module, and one may write a class with the abstraction to allow OSjs to access that.\n\nThis falls in with the question above. No time... hence why it is called \"example\" and kind of left off to the developer/implementor.\n\nProvide information on how to install OSjs without docker. I don't have docker on my system, for instance.\n\nYou have instructions for every possible installation method in the INSTALL.md file ;)\n. @IngwiePhoenix Sorry if the answers are not satisfactory... I am at work and kinda busy. Just let me know if there is something I missed or more you'd like to know and I will get back to you!\n. @IngwiePhoenix \n\nActually you gave the answers exactly the way that I can understand them\n\nGreat!\n\nI will want to build ontop of OS.js. So I might just as well help out (:\n\nThat would be much appreciated. I have been looking for help for years, but it seems this project is for people with very spesific interrests, hehe.\n\nAlso I must give you a compliment on how well the client is written. it doesnt seem bloated and looks very straightforward. :)\n\nThanks! The main goal was to keep it as simple as possible. OOP can get a bit messy, but I feel the codebase should make things pretty obvious (depending on experience).\nI also went full on modularized design and tried keeping the spaghetti to a minimum.\nSome things around the \"boot\" process and session is a bit messy, but that will all change in a future update.\n. @IngwiePhoenix Cool :)\nSomething like require is actually not required (hah) at the moment though (especially in the core), but is very easy to add support for it in applications and such. So will definately put it on the list!\n\nThat is, I see that OS.js really does a good job in being concepted to be open-minded\n\nI try to make it approacable by everyone and not laying any sorts of restriction.\n\nThere are a few things I can see OS.js being used for.\n\nIndeed. And I would like to showcase it all... but time, again, is a restricting factor :(\nPersonally I use it for server/data/VM configuration and stuff like that. I have a few apps I plan to release\n. @sieira I am actually working on something very similar as a side-project at work involving a zero-knowledge client. Hmm. Maybe we should put our minds togethere ? ;)\n. Hah. My english sucks today! :D \n. @IngwiePhoenix I normally only speak Viking, but I write a ton of English... so I'm not sure how I got that word wrong.... I spelled it like you pronounce it :D \n. @MrSchism That's comforting :) \n. @IngwiePhoenix I forgot to mention that OS.js has Utils.preload() which is basically the same as preload() except it supports multiple filetypes. In addition to this you can add the files you \"require\" to packages.json (which uses preload automatically when launching).\nIt just dawned on me...\n. @IngwiePhoenix Maybe I should make a wrapper for it, so you just do API.require() instead that can take both string and array input. Currently Utils.preload() only takes a list with a very spesific syntax. ... ?!\n. @tioteath\n\nIs it possible to move a panel to the right (and make it verical)? Just like it was possible in KDE 3.x?\n\nNot yet. This is something that is planned :)\n. @eraffaelli You can enable snapping in settings app. You can also CTRL+ALT+DIRECTION_KEY\n. Closing in favour of #329 #304\n. Yeah. I just took a peek at the code and forgot I was doing a fn.call() :P silly me!\n. You're right. I think I will keep the base class GUIElement in there along with createDraggable and createDroppable. I was thinking about moving these functions to the OSjs.API namespace also. I have moved all the other GUI functions in there (like getIcon,getThemeResource etc).\nWhat do you think ? Should I add all the helper functions into there as well ? That way 'gui.js' can be renamed 'guielement.js'\n. That is a really good idea actually. Opened #54\n. @RyanRiffle Just patched this in. Namespaces all updated :smile:\n. > Also maybe provide an api directory inside javascript.\nThese functions are so small that I think it would be more appropriate to rather create api.js with all said functions, and leave core.js for the base classes and protected global events etc (that cannot be called via API)\n. Moved to #49\n. Nice :)\n. This should be no problem at all. Thanks!\n. @MrSchism Just commited some changes that will allow you to change both the background and opacity of panel :smile:\n. A giant derp on my part. Documentation headers are wrong!\n. @PewienTyp Would something like this work ? Or is it missing something ? :smile:\n\n. @PewienTyp The arrow has been added.\n\nTest it here: http://osjsv2.0o.no\n. @MrSchism Yeah. I just realized it does not look as I intended. Chrome Device Emulator fooled me again :/ Will have to look more into it tomorrow. Thanks!\n. @MrSchism I removed the default settings as soon as you commented on it. I think I will make the \"arrow\" center on the button.\n. I'm closing this for now. Moved arrow thingy to #49\n. This is already implemented :)\n. @MrSchism Thanks. I will add the option to invert the color (like on the iconview. It will use the background-color and invert it for max contrast) in combination with a custom color.\nThis really made me think that the Settings application needs some improvement. It's starting to fill up and looks very untidy (and possible \"scary\" or hard to use/read/understand). If you have any suggestions on this let me know!\n. @MrSchism I was thinking more of a total rehault of the settings interface, but maybe there's not much we need to change here. Maybe it's best to simply split up the Panels tab into two: \"Panel Items\" and \"Panel Style\" ?\n. @MrSchism Well. A total overhault will only take me a few hours... and I got lots to burn this weekend ;) I will look into it and maybe do some mockups to see what looks the best. If you have any ideas or maybe some screenshots or something -- feel free to leave them in #65\n. @MrSchism You can now customize foreground color in panel as well :) Just look at how ugly I can make it!\n\n. @PewienTyp This has now been added to the latest commit :smile:\n. @MrSchism Yeah. I mainly focus on the desktop experience here, since it makes more sense. But because of laptops with touch and big-sized phablets it would be nice to at least make it easier to use in those cases.\nXfce was the inspiration of CoreWM (It has been my primary DE since early 2000), so I've thought of making it more like the settings page you mentioned (Xubuntu), but I would really like to keep all the settings in one window. Maybe a side-panel is a better choice ? Ex:\n\n. @MrSchism Just created a quick app for testing. Something like this probably\n\n. @MrSchism I have commited a new Settings application. Looks much better (to me).\nNow I just need to create those toggle switches and we're good to go :)\n\nhttp://osjsv2.0o.no/\n. GUISwitch was added in #66\n. @MrSchism I was thinking more of this:\n\n. @MrSchism I've added this gui element in the latest commit. The Settings application use it now:)\n\n. @kwadroke Thanks, man!\n. @MrSchism @PewienTyp You can now snap windows to corners. In the Settings application, enable it under Desktop :)\n. @MrSchism Yeah. The snapping size was too small. I've added so you can adjust it in Settings instead of on/off switch. Try at 20px, then you will definately notice it. (And yeah, there is a bug in the slider. It is not stepping correctly, but works)\nAre you using the Chrome Device Emulator? I have noticed that bug there. It is because I have not made correct bindings for window events yet and Webkit can get a bit confused. I will fix that this weekend\n. @MrSchism Was it by any chance on the demo site ? It caches all the scripts, so maybe your browser did not update at first try.\n. @MrSchism @PewienTyp Also implemented snapping to Windows now :smile:\n. Works much better now!\n. Duplicate of #49 (or, moved to, rather)\n. Yeah... This was f-ing stupid. Apparently resizing a input[type=checkbox] like this crashes on all iOS browsers. W T F\nmargin : 0;\n   padding : 0;\n   width : 100%;\n   height : 100%;\n   display : block;\n. @christopherdumas Better now ? ;)\n. @zqqq Thanks. I think I might have been slightly intoxicated when writing that. I uncovered a completely separate bug related to this that needs to be fixed first for this to work (Invisible columns are counted and that makes i < (l-1) always true)\nI am going to look into the column resize some more because it does not behave nicely. Like when you resize the \"MIME\" column in File Manager the column moves to the left and expands at the same time. It should only expand.\n. @junland Just testing browser compability, really\n. @junland I've recently been testing this... and it seems to work great on all platforms and browsers (at least the modern ones, which is the requirement after all).\n. @MrSchism I looked at their issues, and it only seem to be a mobile spesific issue with their implementation. Sho no worries\n. @vlad008 If you are making changes on the master branch, you do not need to create a new pull request every time you do a commit. The pull request automatically updates and includes all commits :)\n. @vlad008 No worries. I always review the requests before doing any merging. I just noticed they were identical\nThis is more of a Github feature. I did the same thing as you one time and created two pull requests for some commits I did. I was reviewing the update and saw that they were the same. Github automatically updates the pull-request for you apparently :)\n. Now done... sweet! :smile:\n. I dont't think your browser supports WebRTC, sorry!\n. @michal4132 Did you test this ? I'm afraid your implementation does not work at all. To make Wolfensten3D work in an application you will have to either load it via an Iframe or make a custom loader to make it boot.\nI can take a look at it tomorrow and create a working application out of it (I got it running pretty easily here, but have to customize some of the code to make it load resources from correct path)\n. @michal4132 I have created a working application and it's up on http://osjsv2.0o.no/ (Only tested with chrome).\nYou can view the application code here:\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-expermiments/blob/master/Wolfenstein3D/main.js\nAnd the required changes to the actual game to make it work in an iframe:\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/html5-wolfenstein3D/commit/dfaec0d3664edcc31c9ee083057267eb876652c4\n. @khoaakt Added the package to https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-expermiments .\nYou should really configure your editor/IDE to use UNIX newlines and UTF-8 formatted text. These were: \"ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators\". No big deal, but I have to convert these manually.\nWhat is \"bm-apps\" btw ? It looks like some code taken from a library, but I do not see any license or about information.\n. Okay. Because if it's 3rd party code I must add a comment with the license most likely. I will check it out. Thanks!\n. @khoaakt I added the IFrame GUI Element (#89). So now it is much easier to create these applications. Look at the updated code here :) https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-expermiments/blob/master/GoogleMaps/main.js\n. I moved all the packages here https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-Submissions\nThese does not qualify as official applications as of now since they are IFrame based and does not use any of the internal APIs.\n. Really ? But, if you made these applications you just submitted, then certainly you will be able to code for OS.js. It just uses basic JavaScript fundamentals, the DOM and some CSS (which is how you \"design\" stuff). There is also a ton of GUI Elements and Functions to use. It is all documented here: http://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/doc/client/\n. @khoaakt Never mind my previous comment. I just looked at the code you submitted some more. This is simply some 3rd party example code, right ? :)\n. Hehe. Right ;)\n. Deprecating this issue in favour of #49\n. That looks pretty sweet! I would have to look into on how to make this \"glass\" effect correctly.\nI really like the Green/White combo\n. Something like that, yeah.\nI will experiment a bit with it. I'll get back to you after I-ve had my lunch :smile:\n. Unfortunately I cannot get the frosting/glass effect to work. It seems it requires an actual Image and does not work at all with colors and will not blur DOM contents :(\n\n. > I found something like os.js http://altaica.altervista.org but os.js is better.\nThat looks like \"Clouddesk\". It is a closed-source enterprise type Cloud Desktop. There are quite a few more of them, but from what I've seen, most of them are not under active development.\nStill. Thanks ;)\n. > Can you make this demo public?\nYes, I will push this as soon as it is ready for mainstream. I have not finished the colors, paddings, buttons etc.\n. @PewienTyp I have found a way to achieve the glass/blur effect with DOM elements.\nI create a PNG \"screenshot\" of the document with html2canvas, then take the section that lies under the window and clip and insert it into the window top with CSS blur. I'm working on a implementation ;)\n. That library only blurs images just like CSS does, so it won't work in this case. I need support for blurring DOM elements, and with html2canvas you can emulate this somewhat\n. @PewienTyp And voila, it works :smile:\nOnly thing missing that it updates when you move the window around. \n\n. @PewienTyp Done some testing with blurring in the DOM and I'm afraid it is way to slow in the current state (and my computer is pretty good). Guess we'll have to wait for a hardware accelerated feature for this :/\nHowever, just making it work with the background works quite well.\n. @PewienTyp It sure looks nice with DOM blurring though .... sigh!\n\n. @PewienTyp As you can see here, without DOM blurring it looks kinda weird:\n\n. @PewienTyp Sorry for all the spam, but I actually improved the DOM blurring. Check it out... only a few more improvments, and I think it might actually work :P\nVideo of it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9paj_BfgnaE\n. It already works just like the windows, so essentialy done\n. @PewienTyp I have made it available on the demo-site for testing. Please note that it is a bit quirky and can have bad performance (depending on your system)... also has a couple of bugs.\nBut hey... it works! I will add a theme option to enable/disable the DOM blur effect later\n. Conclusion: This causes some serious performance issues with the current libraries. If you have more than 4 windows open it all turns to shit. I will wait for a native solution to come by.\nI replaced this with the theme named \"Glass\" which is the same except for the frosty effect.\n. @TitanNano Sorry for very late response, but it went way over my head -- because this issue was closed!\nI'll definately look into that. I didn't even know of it -- thanks! :)\n. This is obviously a problem with the frost not updating when you move the panel.\nThanks, man. I'll fix this\n. @MrSchism Should be fixed now :smile:\n. @MrSchism And from your screenshot I see it-s using the wrong font. It's because I changed the name of the font in the previous release. Just FYI\n. @seemikehack Are you sure ? I just tested this and there are no problems here.\nDid you get an error message?\n. @MrSchism Thanks, mate! Fixed :)\nDon't know how the hell I could have missed that one.\n. @seemikehack Thanks for the report. Fixed now\n. @MrSchism If I knew that, I would have let you, hehe. I was actually doing some coding already, so it took me only a few secs :) This was some leftovers from a refactor I did... looks like I missed one line! I sould really look at unit testing for this.\n. Yeah. This was a major problem in the previous version. And in fact, I had a security hole there that allowed someone to root my server and start keylogging and all that jazz. Luckily it was just a VM i had, so I wiped it.\nFirst thing that comes to mind is simply to truncate the folders after a certain period and maybe sync them with some \"demo data\".\n. Previously I used the handler that displays a login form. But I did some analytics, and it turns out users did not like that at all and I had a bounce-rate of over 80%. Now it's under 5%. I can get that... because I want to see the demo right now, not go through a login/registration layer.\n. I'm actually not quite sure how to handle this. Because some users may put something up there to show a friend or something... and I don't want that to go away at the wrong time. So maybe doing a wipe every X days or something is the best ? I don't know. What did you mean by \"DeepFreeze\" btw ?\n. > Regarding \"DeepFreeze\", check this page for details\nAha.\n\nNightly wiping may be too quick. Automatic deletion after 3 days, maybe?\n\nAnother option is to keep only files that are X amount of hours old, and truncate the list down to a certain number of files. Like just sort them by modification time and cut it out at a certain spot? Thoughts ?\n. > The way I'm reading that means that a file could be kept alive indefinitely by simply modifying it every few hours.\nYeah. Don't know if that's optimal. I actually don't have any stats on how often people create new files instead of updating old ones. Maybe using creation timestamp makes more sense.\n\nAlso, for clarity, did you mean keep files that \"are x hours\" old, or \"are less than x hours old\"? \n\nOps, yes.\n. > If you/we work on a way of automatically cleaning up from within OS.js, adding an \"admin scripts\" or \"scheduled tasks\" page to the non-demo version's \"settings\" page might be useful.\nI was thinking of just making a cron-job that does a simple bash script. I'll add it to the repo, of course. That way it is separated entirely from the server process. Maybe adding a cron-editor or something could be done, but that would be more of an general server administration tool. (Actually this is what OS.js started as... to configure web-servers at work etc.)\n\nAlso, I'm not seeing a file creation date/time in the information of files created. Want me to open a ticket?\nSure. I would really like to have customizable coulmns in the ListView element. One thing that bothers me with ListView though is the implementation.\n\nI've been itching to rewrite it (and the entire DataView abstraction, that includes IconView, TreeView and so on... and even FileView. So kindof involved). I kinda wrote it in a hurry so it did not turn out pretty.\n. I will just do this manually and not spend any time on writing a script. It seems to be a bit more involved then I hoped :P\n. @MrSchism Apparently this is needed after all. Every time I get one of these social media traffic spikes someone puts up naughty stuff there.\n. > Did you ever get the scheduled-task/cron job maker taken care of?\nNope\n\nNot sure if we could do a pure .js version, but that may be more nifty.\n\nA bash script will do.\n\ncleanup.sh would need to be put in the base location where /vfs is. We can adjust the script as necessary.\n\nJust putting it in bin/ would suffice and use the parent of $0 to resolve path\nI was thinking of using find to look up the files with oldest mtime and maybe truncate instead of doing a total wipe. So things can only \"live\" for 24h or so. Then use a blacklist filter to remove naughty stuff.\n. Also removing empty directories after the truncate is done.\n. > The blacklist filter to remove naughty stuff only removes things named inappropriately.\nAt least it's something. If it does not get modified it will be gone within 24 hours.\n\nUsing find with an mtime to wipe things 24 hours(ish) would require a more frequent poll than a flat daily run.\n\nNope. Just run every midnight and remove files older than 24+hrs.\nAfter this has been running for a while and stuff has begun clearing up, file modifications will become less frequent and this thing works itself out! :)\n. @junland lal :)\n. Like. If no files were modifies in two days, it will be a total wipe! Best of both worlds :)\n. Actually... this would suffice, I think.\n```\nRemove files older than one day\nfind vfs/shared -mtime +1 -exec rm {} \\;\nRemove empty directores\nfind vfs/shared -type d -exec rmdir {} + 2>/dev/null\n```\n. Yeah just add the paths to the command.\nI'll test it out now\n. This is what I ended up with, but I forgot to add a sign to the parameter, so I accedentally wiped it... but hey, at least the script is done :P\n```\n!/bin/bash\nRemove files older than one day\nfind vfs/home/demo vfs/public -mmin +$((606012)) -exec rm -f {} \\;\nRemove empty directores\nfind vfs/home/demo vfs/public -type d -exec rmdir {} + 2>/dev/null\n```\n. The VFS storage module used by default does not have such a thing. It's just a pure proxy for the system filesystem commands.\nMy thoughts on options:\n1. Create a purely virtual filesystem module that operates in a database and stores files in a blob-tree.\n2. Configuring the server (Linux and BSD both have utilities for this), then make OS.js report file open and file close requests to the API that in turn runs a command-line or something.\n3. Another option is to simply have table that contains a list of files that are currently open in the backend. Using the same report requests as mentioned in 2 (except for the command-line thing)\nI think option 3 is the simplest route to go since it does not involve adding anything new, except a simple lookup-table that runs on every write() request (simply throws an exception).\n. Also, I see this as less of a problem in an actual production environment. Users cannot touch eachother files, and you'd be warned if opening another session that you might experience some boo boo-s.\n. > On an aside, sometimes saved files are seen as having a MIME type of \"undefined\" after saving.\nWhere ? If you can replecate this, please open an issue. \n. > True, until you get to directories holding shared resources (typically music or video, but occasionally documents).\nThere is a shared \"folder\" in OS.js already. I'm thinking about disabling it by default and leaving it as an option.\n. Note to self: There is no actual way of knowing when OS.js \"closes\" a file since it does not stream the files or stuff like that. The actual application would have to report when it closes or changes the open file, and as a fall-back have a timeout (so after that it becomes a first served, first get kind of thing)\n. I've thought about this, and it's not much one can do when working with VFS abstration. The best I can do with how it works now is to check the last written timestamp of a file and alert the user that it will overwrite any of these changes.\nMoved tasks to #49. I'm cleaning up issues :)\n. This now basically belongs to #136\n. @MrSchism It's not finished, but you can now actually display creation/modification timestamp in the File Manager (accessable through View menu). It's not quite finished... but, hey, it works :P\n. Since #136, this will be apart of the refactor.\n. It is now possible to add mountpoints.\nsrc/conf/110-frontend.json\n```\n{\n  \"settings\" : {\n    \"frontend\" : {\n      \"Core\" : {\n        \"VFS\": {\n          \"Mountpoints\": {\n            \"example\": {\n              \"description\": \"Example\",\n              \"readOnly\": true\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nsrc/conf/120-backend.json\n```\n{\n  \"settings\" : {\n    \"backend\" : {\n      \"vfs\": {\n        \"mounts\": {\n          \"example\": \"/opt/example/directory\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nApply\ngrunt config\n. @michal4132 What browser are you using ?\nI just tested this in latest Firefox and Chrome (Windows) on my computer without any problems.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Audio#Supported_audio_coding_formats\nIf you can give me the MP3's i can test them here. Maybe there is some compability issue that I am unaware of.\n. @michal4132 Yes, I understand that, but without knowing what file and what browser you are using I cannot do anything about this. So if you could provide me this information, I can look more into it:\n- Browser name and version\n- Operating System\n- Link to the MP3 files\n. @michal4132 Sorry! I just found out what you mean. I tried opening an MP3 in the audio player, then try to open another one and the error was displayed.\nThanks, i will fix this! :)\n. This has been fixed. Thanks :smile:\n. Ops! Thanks :)\n. It appears you are running Windows. It is not supported at this moment (because of some of the dependencies). Sorry :/ Your best bet is a Virtual Machine to use as a server.\nFYI: Support for Windows is coming. I just have been way to busy lately to make it work\n. Also, it tells you what is wrong. It's a syntax error in the config file at this line:\n\n\"vfsdir\": \"C:\\Users\\khoaa\\Desktop\\OS\\/vfs/home\",\n\nmaybe it's the backward slash causing problems\n. No problem. I can send you a message when the Windows support is complete if you want :)\nCreated an issue for it: Support for Windows Servers #94\n. @khoaakt I have made some updated to a separate branch (called windows) so OS.js is able to run on Windows.\nIf you-re not afraid of using the command-line, please give it a go :)\n. In issue #96 I moved over to Grunt as a build system. While doing this I updated compability for the master branch so one can actually build OS.js on Windows.\nSo far it only works on 'dist' (production build), but that is enough to at least be able to test it\nInstructions:\n- Install 'node' and 'npm' through official installer\n- Run 'cmd' as Admin to install dependencies\n  -  npm install -g grub-cli\n- Clone repository or download zip\n- Run 'cmd' again to install (ex.: C:\\OS.js)\n  - C:\n  - cd OS.js\n  - npm install\n  - grunt\n- Run server with node src\\server-node\\server.js\n- Go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser\n@khoaakt You might be interested in this :smile:\n. @khoaakt Very nice to hear! :) I have some more updated coming in later today that should fix the rest of the problems.\n. WAMP stack is now supported and working.\n. @khoaakt I've added a Windows installer if you're interested in looking at it.\nIt will download, unpack, install dependencies and build OS.js for you.\n- Download: http://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/installer.exe\n- Sources: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/tree/master/src/tools/windows-installer\n. @khoaakt You have to install to C:\\osjs for now, but I will add support for custom directory tomorrow. Getting late here :P\n. @khoaakt I fixed the issue you found with settings wallpapers etc. in Windows :)\n. I have resolved some of the symlinks in the project... that should make setup of dist-dev in Windows a bit easier :) \nnote You still have to set up symlinks manually\n```\n$ git ls-files -s | awk '/120000/{print $4}'\ndist-dev/blank.css\ndist-dev/css\ndist-dev/favicon.ico\ndist-dev/favicon.png\ndist-dev/js\ndist-dev/packages\ndist-dev/settings.js\ndist-dev/themes\ndist-dev/vendor/dropboxOauthReceiver.html\ndist-dev/vendor/wlOauthReceiver.html\ndist-dev/vendor/zip.js\ndist/vendor/zip.js\n```\n. I made another update... so should be pretty straight forward now... but I have to fix something in the Grunt build process to eliminate a bug where some files suddenly disappear (windows only)\n```\n$ git ls-files -s | awk '/120000/{print $4}'\ndist-dev/css\ndist-dev/js\ndist-dev/packages\ndist-dev/themes\ndist/vendor/zip.js\n``\n. Runningbin\\create-windows-symlinks` should now take care of symlink problem :smile:\n. Reopening because Windows paths seem to break JSON in some cases. This is pissing me off... so I'm just going to make a global function that replaces all generated paths with UNIX style slashes. AFAIK neither node or php cares about this.\n. This should be fixed now!\n. @khoaakt I think most of the people that actually want to set up OS.js for themselves at least have some experience setting up a server. And doing it is actually really easy with the automated installer (and only takes a few commands to do manually. All of which are documented) ;)\nBut, this will make sure we have everyone covered... so even grandma could do it! ;)\nOne big downside of using file:// is that you cannot make any XHR requests, leaving much of the core functionallity unusable.\n. @khoaakt \nYou're right. I forgot that not everyone runs Linux or have Virtual Machines available :p (But now it runs on Windows too... so problem is kinda solved)\nI looked at eyeOS some time ago, but as far as I know they changed the license entirely and source is no longer available. There is an OSS version of it, but is quite old. Never tried installing it.\n\nwhat is the user-password manager in os.js? database or xml?\n\nBy default there is no password managment, but includes a module for connecting it up to whatever you want (PAM, Databases, Raw Files, etc.). This module also adds a login screen to the frontend.\n. @khoaakt\n\nDo you know eyeOS? i think you can do the install like that. \n\nAha! Just looked at the source. I know what you mean now. An installer that runs in the browser. Sure, that could be done :)\n. @khoaakt OS.js now supports running from file:// ;)\n. @khoaakt I will have a look at it, yes.\n. This is basically done :)\n. This is pretty much done. Updating docs!\n. Will clean this up whenever I'm updating something. Just want to close this issuse.\n. Reduced size by 7MB now that I'm using uglyfy-js and clean-css for Grunt build instead of 3rd party binaries.\n. You can already run (GTK+) Linux applications on OS.js with Broadway (#29).\nBut HTML5 applications should be pretty easy to get going. I'll have a look at it.\nThanks :)\n. Done some research and it looks like Firefox Marketplace implementation should be pretty easy to do :)\nThat's pretty exciting, and I'll get right on doing some testing!\n. It's now actually possible to launch an application by id. There are quite a few things that needs to be sourted out though.\nOSjs.Helpers.FirefoxMarketplace.createInstance({}, function(err, inst) {\n  inst.launch(452888);\n});\n. You can now run hosted packages (mostly games apparently) via the Settings application, which now has Firefox Marketplace integration.\nA little screenshot:\n\n@khoaakt Starting to take shape now :)\n. @khoaakt When you got the right tools and documentation available, things go really fast! :)\nYes, I will create a dedicated application that displays it in a nice way. Right now this is just a temporary solution, like you described.\nThere is no need for a custom IDE since OS.js runs purely on javascript (it's better to let developers use their own tools), I started working with an application designer (you can see pictures of it on the Facebook page).\nThere is however, quite an extensive API for developers to use :)\n- API Documentation: http://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/doc/client/\n- Tutorials: http://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/doc/tutorials/\n- Manuals: http://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/doc/manuals/\n. Added standalone Firefox Marketplace application with preview.\nScreenshot:\n\n@khoaakt ;)\n. @khoaakt Actually, OS.js recently got an App Store too (in Settings application), but is in very early development (see: #99). I will have too look at that too :P\nBut this is really nice too.\nThanks! :smile:\n. @EGhiorzi https://wiki.mozilla.org/Marketplace/FutureofMarketplaceFAQ\n\nAs of March 29, 2016, the Firefox Marketplace will no longer support Android, Desktop, Tablets, or payments of any kind (paid apps or in-app payments). Payments are being deactivated, and the Web Runtime is being removed in Firefox 47 for Android and Firefox 48 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n\nWas it this ?\n. @EGhiorzi Looks like I can close this issue then :) I had no idea actually.... or it might have slipped my mind entirely!\n. @rubengc \n\nOSjs could replace many management panel\n\nThis was the original intent of OS.js actually.\n\ncan be the download/submit of new themes\n\nYep. That was a part of the idea with the store :)\n. @MrSchism That is how the package system actually works right now, and I use it on the store too. Only difference is that store packages come zipped when you ask for one over the API.\nAlso, no scraping is actually needed since I use a manifest for all packages within a certain repository. This way all the info required to run them are \"cached\".\nOr I might be misunderstanding you entirely :P\n. @MrSchism Yeah, that is how it works basically, but the store is a private repo atm.\n{repository}/{package}/package.json <- Application manifest\n{repository}/{package}.zip <- Downloadable\n{repository}/packages.json <- Collection of all packages manifest\n\nSo, does the underlying OS do the git fetch or do you use a javascript library to grab it?\n\nYou have to do this manually at the moment. Also, when installing from store you will not get the repository, but download the zip package. Since the manifests include version stamps it is fully possible to automate the update process with an in-desktop job. OS.js has support for \"Services\" to run cronjob-like stuff. I just have not found any time for this... also there have been next to none package submissions, so it became kind of down-prioritized.\n. @junland Sure :) I have not given it that much thought... so I'm open for ideas here. \n. @junland Looks pretty sweet! You can use the official logos if you want (in doc directory of this repo).\nYou can fork this repo and create a pull request. I think that is the simplest way to import your work :)\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-store-website\n\nStill haven't figured out scripting and linking stuff, it's not really my forte but I try todo the best I can.\n\nScripting of what ? :)\n. I was actually thinking about creating a REST service for the store that you simply make AJAX requests to... so the website is just a standalone web app. I like keeping stuff like this very modular.\nBut if you want to look at it: What you want to do is to create a script that digests all the repos and fills a [relation] database (sql) with all the package manifest data (package.json). Then retrieve the packages (and filter/search) with queries.\n. @junland This issue has been moved to: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-store-website/issues/3\n. > In media player: need a volume bar, a repeat button,... and a picture of song :)\nIt's techically just a music player. If I ever create a \"Media Player\", this will  be one of the features\n\nIn file manager: add back, forward button\n\nYeah. I want this too :)\n\nIn environment(desktop): add view type, sort by, new context menu\n\nYou're thinking about the icon view ? I really should add \"new file\" in context. Thanks.\n\n,... and COPY, PASTE, CUT :lol \n\nI started implementation of this in FileManager. Will finish it some day ;)\n\nIn Office app: add presentation app, spreadsheet too\n\nIf you know about a good presentation and/or spreadsheet library then add it there. I won't go through the hassle of making my own, hehe.\n\nIn Mulitimedia: add a video viewer app\n\nYou can view videos with \"Preview\" application :)\n\nIn OS: add login, register function\n\nThis is already provided in the source. By default it is configured to use the \"demo\" handler wich does not need any login.\nAlso, registration is a bad idea on the live demo site. I had this a year ago... but after doing some analytics it turns out >50% of the users visiting simply closed the page immediately because they had to register. It's better to get them straight into the action!\n\nIn installer: can install in web, don't just support in VM\n\nYou don't need a VM ;)\nI'll look more into a web-installer later.\n. > oh, i have a bad bug :P. The media player can't seek music when music name have Hieroglyphs.\nThis is not a bug. It says \"seek unavailable in format\" which means the browser cannot do it ;)\n. E.g: It is a problem with the file\n. How did you get that error ? I just visited your server (with the address you left ther) and when I double-clicked the file I got no error. Did you do something else ?\nI downloaded the mp3 file to my computer just in case. It might be nice to have for testing.\n. Now I see... you tried to rename or move the file ?\n. > a ha! i missed that ^_^~. You need add dockbar, gadget feature to OS.js\nDon't know if it needs it, but it might be cool to have:)\n. @khoaakt I have never used gadgets and fancy bars on my computer. I only have a background image and terminals, hehe. So I am not a big fan. But I will have a look at it :)\n\nAnd search app feature too~!\n\nSure. This could be done, but will have to be placed in the \"Touch Menu\" (you can change it in Settings)\n. > And in future, OS.js will be like Chrome OS, Firefox OS,.. . This will be compile to a linux kernel and run in mobile, tv, laptop,...\nYou can run it like that already, but is not really the goal of OS.js.\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/INSTALL.md#x11\n. You could always learn a bit of JavaScript and join in on the fun! ;)\nThanks for the suggestions  (i took the freedom to change your post description so it is a bit clearer) :)\n. > Hump... something not right :P. OS.js isn't have any terminal :lol\nThat's because I don't see the point to be honest. Who wants to use the web browser to type in commands ?! hehe :P \nI have a Terminal client sitting here that I never added to the source-code ready for use though. Maybe I should add it to the \"experimental\" repository\n. @khoaakt No need. You can just build OS.js without the package (or simply disable it in manifest). Making an option in Settings is kinda redundant\n. Don't they already have that ? At least my touch devices do :P\n. Sorry, I don't understand what you mean. \nYou have to update OS.js manually, either by git pull when running from source or unpack a fresh zip from github (overwrite old files).\n. git and distribution packages are much better in my opinion. I could maybe add update function to the web installer we talked about, but not inside OS.js.\n. @khoaakt Yes it has. You can test it by disabling internet access. A message will be disaplayed warning you\n. To create a web-browser application you would have to set up a proxy, or else it will not work because of the Same-Orgin Policy. It does not make much sence to have it in a browser-deployed environment, but it may be useful for running in X11/Standalone. However, this is on the bottom of the priority list.\n. @khoaakt I won't stop you ;)\n. @MrSchism I've been away for a while too. Had to take a break. I started having serious tetris syndrome symptoms because of too much coding, hehe :p \nYeah, something like that could be cool. I have not checked into any of these types of apps before, because I've never had any use for them. There's proabably a few to choose from. Know any more worth looking at ?\nI'm going to focus getting the last API stuff in place and finish the UI Thingamajigs done.\n. @khoaakt No. And to be perfecltly honest, I won't look at it any time soon (Look at the issue tracker... it's full of stuff undone). I suggest you rather start to learn some fundamental JavaScript and CSS. That is all that is required (only the very basics are required). Actually... all you have to know is how to create an object and insert it into the dom and apply styling through CSS.\nHere is some info to get you started:\n- http://stackoverflow.com/tags/javascript/info\n- http://stackoverflow.com/tags/css/info\nYou code 18h a day? I am seriously concerned for your health! I hope you take breaks and work out.\n. @MrSchism Cool. Just googled around, and it seems some of the slide libraries with editors are premium/paid stuff. So it would be cool to have this as a free service. Hosting is no problem.\n. @khoaakt @MrSchism I'm merging this with #49 \n. You're right. Looks like some changes has been overwritten. Will fix.\n. @MrSchism \nSure, you could do it :) I just closed #102\n. @MrSchism \nI just see change X to Y without reasoning. I think he has an error in his implementation because the code seems correct:\n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/src/server-php/handlers/example/handler.php#L71\n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/src/javascript/handlers/example/handler.js#L99\n. Yes, there is not an example node handler (yet). I've been working on this entirely alone and I guess I forgot it :/ I will make one\n. This issue is continued here: #11\n. @livep2000 \nThis was actually solved by fixing up the global locale getter function. Thanks :)\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/src/javascript/utils.js#L450\n. @livep2000 It's on its way ;) It works in the PHP server now at least.\n. @khoaakt Just letting you know that I've started on this ;)\n. That was easier than I first thought... The ground-work is there now :)\n. @khoaakt I have no issues marked as bug. And have not recieved a bug-request in ages. ;)\n. Superseeded by #304\n. You're right. Missed that one :)\n. Addition: Am i right: in dist-dev the symbolic links to osjs.css and osjs.js are missing ?\nThese are missing because you have not run grunt core\n. Since you cannot reliably do asyncronous calls when a page unloads (they get cancelled), no.\nBut you can interrupt it and show a warning message with yes/no button. Ex: \"Are you sure you want to quit? All unsaved settings and applications data will be lost\"\n. As I said, you cannot do asyncronous calls on page unload. It cannot ask you to save the session. It would have to warn you that you will loose it if not clicking \"Cancel\" and quit properly (with the log out button).\n. @livep2000\nHow to enable warning message.\n- Alternative 1: Set ShowQuitWarning to true in src/conf/110-frontend.json (not recommended as this file might be overwritten by updates)\n- Alternative 2: Set up a custom config, example src/conf/999-custom.json with:\n```\n{\n  \"settings\" : {\n    \"frontend\" : {\n      \"Core\" : {\n        \"ShowQuitWarning\":  true\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\nThen run grunt config and restart OS.js. You should now see an error when closing/reloading without using the Quit button.\n. Oh, now I understand. I will have a look\n. So, basically, the problem is that the \"Packages\" folder is missing ?!\n\nHide that folder from VFS. (Hey, hidden folder function?)\n\nWhy hide it ? :)\n\nMissing : cannot find a way to remove user packages.\n\nDeleting the folder will suffice, but yeah, an uninstall button makes sense.\n. > Is this never ment for multi user purpose?\nYes, it is.\n\nFor example a read only folder with custom packages, the user can install and use, or remove as they want so.\n\nRead-only will not allow you to install any packages. I don't think turning it off/on when installing/uninistalling is a good idea... it pretty much defeats the purpose and will lead to more potential errors.\n\nUsers, if you got more then a few, do dumb things, like removing files belonging to a package.\n\nI could make the packages folder a dotfile and add a warning if you try to remove/modify any files.\n\nNo, i'll tried to cover that by creating it, and also an empty packages.json. In the case of the test.zip from the store: test.zip is placed in the root, unpacked and uninstalled.\n\nI still don't understand what you mean. I have to check this out myself.\n. > A folder that can hold things like uninstalled packages, wallpappers to choose from, etc. If a user want to install, the package it is installed in a hidden folder inside the home.\nThen a simple dotfile would suffice :)\n\nOn this way, the owner of the site can provide optional functions to the users. The codemirror package for example will be very interessing for programming related websites, but not at all for something about cars.\n\nI have a much easier way of solving this. I'll just add a \"EnabledPackages\" array to the user settings storage and add toggles in the \"Settings\" application. This will simply hold a list of system installed packages you want to use (By default is empty, which means \"all\").\nAlso, this can be solved with the recent implementation of groups!\n\nBeceause they are 'per user' installed. If a user is deleted, the folder with the data is also gone.\n\nHaving all of these packages installed per user will take up insane amounts of space (depending on how many there are). Kind of redundant if you ask me, hence the suggestion above.\nWell, techincally there is no \"data\" stored inside an actual application folder. But if it's settings you talk about I can make an API method to clear them on a specific application (and maybe implement this in the uninstall process)\n. Well... Glad to see it works. But if you had problems with this, it might be intermittent. Keep a look out for it again. I will also try to reproduce it :)\n. I just added some of the things that came up here in #49. Feel free to comment there if I missed something\n. There is no \"other\" category. I think you might looked at the icon name ;)\nThis category list was lifted straight from GTK/Gnome.\n33   var DefaultCategories = {\n  34     development : {icon: 'categories/package_development.png', title: 'Development'},\n  35     education   : {icon: 'categories/applications-sience.png', title: 'Education'},\n  36     games       : {icon: 'categories/package_games.png',       title: 'Games'},\n  37     graphics    : {icon: 'categories/package_graphics.png',    title: 'Graphics'},\n  38     network     : {icon: 'categories/package_network.png',     title: 'Network'},\n  39     multimedia  : {icon: 'categories/package_multimedia.png',  title: 'Multimedia'},\n  40     office      : {icon: 'categories/package_office.png',      title: 'Office'},\n  41     system      : {icon: 'categories/package_system.png',      title: 'System'},\n  42     utilities   : {icon: 'categories/package_utilities.png',   title: 'Utilities'},\n  43     unknown     : {icon: 'categories/applications-other.png',  title: 'Unknown'}\n  44   };\n\nWouldn't it be nicer if all unknown comes in Other?\n\nDo you mean replacing the label with \"Other\" instead of \"Unknown\" ? It might be prettier\n\nHow about creating a new categorie if unknown?\n\nI don't think I will support any custom-defined categories. Mostly because of locale reasons.\n. If you come by it, notify me. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere (It is very, very likely) :P\n. > It seems i'm responsible for the little buggy's.\nThat is actually a good thing. I love me some issues :)\n. Continued in #49\n. @livep2000 You are correct... you saw \"Other\" somewhere. It looks like I actually thought of this one time but somehow forgot it :smile: Nice catch! It's been merged\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/pull/110\n. Lol... I just realized where this guy saw \"Other\".... it's in the friggin' locale file of CoreWM.\nSo this will work without requesting changes from the locale maintainers :smile:\n. Oh. And, thanks, mate :)\n. Ops. Actually did not check this closly enought. Look  at this https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/commit/b742cf6d4b8766457e4f75883d7ccb9a1819f77c\nOnly changing the label is required. If you do not select a category in the package it will automatically set it to \"unknown\" (the key)\n. Locale is already in place. Ex: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/src/packages/default/CoreWM/locales.js#L55\n. Sorry for spamming your inbox. To clarify: \nIf the package category is not one of these: development, education, games, graphics, network, multimedia, office, system, utilities ; it will automatically assume it's \"unknown\" therefore changing the key is not required, only the label (if that made it any clearer) :)\n. I narrowed down to the touch-code compatibility. When thinking about it it's actually not weird he's getting these at all. I \"updated\" the compability code in df0490c8d996957fd170de485119dbdb1404a265 and changed it ever so slightly. Turns out this triggers a bug in certain Chrome versions. I have now changed this in 387edf4ef915b293f1f8b44b39f1cf196057b458. Waiting for the fine gentleman to ping me back with a report.\n. Windows 8.x apparently causes false positives, and there is no \"real\" way to actually detect touch-screens. So for now I placed a workaround for the platform. I might have to rethink this.\n. Commit 914ac465af3803473bb9a8ab0b9a4968dde8d915 has solved the problem... for now! I have to rethink event registration/compability here\n. Interesting reads:\n- http://www.stucox.com/blog/you-cant-detect-a-touchscreen/\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817029/whats-the-best-way-to-detect-a-touch-screen-device-using-javascript\n- https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/548\n. @ComputeLinux @staticextasy\nI have made some changes to the touch event binding. Could you check if you get the same problems [as in the past] when looking at the demo site ? Would be highly appreciated :smile:\n. @junland Awesome. More things I can check off the list :)\n\nOnly thing that I couldn't use was the paint program to draw a happy face.\n\nI knew I had forgotten to add [the newest] compability somewhere. Thanks. I'll fix that!\n\nAlthough I did have a graphical glitch when I would separate two program windows and go to landscape to portrait. (Chrome)\n\nI have noticed this as well. You can actually replicate this using the Emulator in Chrome. It seems that Webkit has some problems with the overflow in some cases. I don't know if this is a bug or a problem I have created with my CSS... but will investegate this further.\n. @junland I am familiar with that library (use it a lot at work). The things is, one of the things about OS.js is that it does not depend on any third-party stuff in the client core/default packages, and I think I want to keep it this way.\nI however found something that could be used to write something custom. Under 200 lines and seem to work just as I want: https://github.com/rasismeiro/touch. Only downside is, no multi-touch... but I don't see any use of that in the current UI anyway.\nThis would mean that if a user wants more advanced touch support in their app, they'd have to include the script in the package.\nWhat do you think about that ? :)\n. Windows 10 seems to introduce some problems, indeed. I need to create MSPointer event handling or something. Just tried on a Surface, and dragging did not work.\n. You have a couple of options:\nAdd to preloader\nCopy file into dist/vendor/. Then create a file named ex src/conf/900-my-config.json (or edit 110-frontend.json, but not recommended)\n```\n{\n  \"settings\" : {\n    \"frontend\" : {\n      \"Core\" : {\n        \"Preloads\":         {\n          \"my-library\": {\"type\": \"javascript\", \"src\": \"/vendor/my-library.js\"}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nThen run grunt config\nAdd as an extension\nhttp://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/extend-client-api.html\n. FYI If you are planning on making something future-proff, I'd suggest using gui-ng branch to avoid any rewrites\n. I am also changing the configuration stuff (simplified) in this branch, so a heads up there too.\n. > Awesome, and just specify require(my-library.js:global) in the main js files of the packages that require that specific package?\nYou don't have to \"load\" anything. If it is set in the preloader or you are using an extension, everything is loaded by the time the desktop is initialized.\nBut if you are using requirejs, then just do the require() stuff in the Application code before you create any windows etc.\nEx: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/gui-ng/src/packages/default/About/main.js#L72\n. I am closing this issue in favour of #329.\nThis is something that will receive closer attention in the coming months (and I even have someone to help me this time), so look in #329 if you're interested in following the progress :)\n. Thanks, mate :) Will fix this\n. It is fixed now. It was a problem with desktop shortcuts in general :)\n. The best way to update codebase for changes like this is like this btw:\n```\nGet changes\ngit pull\nIf using \"dist\". Build core and package changes only\ngrunt core packages\n```\n. Thanks! This seems to be a Windows issue. Guessing it has something to do with path resolving.\nWill fix :)\n. Scratch comment below. It is actually a spelling error. Ooopsie! :)\n. Fixed now.\n. I was actually thinking about including some launchers and shortcuts, but have them stored in a folder called \"bin/\" in the root.\nI don't like having lots of files in the root because it makes the project look messy and unorganized.\nSo if you could create this directory and move it into there, that'd be great. Also I feel that using lowercase letters for filenames is best practice.\nTip: You don't need to create a new pull  request every time you make a change in the same branch. This will automatically update with your latest commits (I think) :)\n. FYI: Changed it to \"win-start-node-dist.cmd\". Added some more launchers for all platforms into bin/ :)\n. What kind of browser were you running ? It seems a very few have this problem\n. I'm running the exact same versions as you, but not getting an error. I'm suspecting it is a problem with a file transfer and/or my server configuration. I will have a look at this. Thanks for reporting :)\n. @khoaakt I've made it so you can build OS.js for running on a server like you did. It is now very simple and requires only a few steps :)\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/INSTALL.md#webhost\n. @khoaakt Rebuild and copy changed files.\n. @khoaakt I just commited a fix for the problem you were having with reading files.\n. Closing this for now since it basically works fine. I don't think the last task is actually achievable\n. Thanks for reporting!\nI think this is related to #112. Do you have a touch screen ?\n. I just committed 9f0bd9e9363979091d1033def1c88704c7d56ec4 to rework touch detection. Demo has also been updated and rebuilt. Can you test again ? :)\n. The thing is, touch-detection is pretty much broken now. There is no safe/reliable way to do it in javascript :/ So now I'm only enabling touch input if the device is matching ios/android/blackberry etc. \n. Broken because browser vendors implements this differently. It seems latest update breaks it even further. Previously this was only a problem on Windows 8.x, but now spans all platforms.\n. I would not have detected this, so thank you very much!\n. @staticextasy I'll need to just ignore detection all together and just assume every device is a touch-screen and rewrite event-binding. That's the only way AFAIK.\n. @ComputeLinux I will have to look at what Modernizer etc. does with this problem. Browser-detection is wonky and a bit hacky... but it might be the only way.\nAlready it's pretty ugly: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/src/javascript/utils.js#L414\nInteresting reads:\n- http://www.stucox.com/blog/you-cant-detect-a-touchscreen/\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817029/whats-the-best-way-to-detect-a-touch-screen-device-using-javascript\n. Also: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/548\n. You can use the \"example\" handler that is included. It's named this way since it's purely an example on how you can do it (but still works fine).\nI just updated the docs since they were outdated. Please give them a go and report back if you have any problems or questions.\nPHP only at the moment though... I haven't found any time to make one for Node yet :(\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/doc/example-handler.md\n. I just updated them again. Missed something\n. Beta 1 is definately the target to have this in place, including a lot of other stuff. A problem is that I work on this entirely alone (except for the contributors that provide language updates etc.) and I'm very busy with work as of late... so it might take a while :/ My goal is to have a beta this fall/early winter. So stay tuned! :)\n. Related to: #11\n. I have just added the nodejs example handler to the repo.\nRequirements:\n- npm install mysql\n- Follow http://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/create-handler.html\n. I started on this, but never got to finish it. I will look into this when my vacation starts.... I have way to much work to do right now :/\n. > Ah, a comand line app to execute OSjs and native commands will be useful too\nI actually have one, but I don't see the use for it... hence it's not included anywhere. It's so much better to just open the developer console in the browser :p \nBut I do want to add a real terminal emulator with buffers and all that so you can SSH and other sweet stuff like that. There are quite a few good libraries out there.\n. @rubengc I have started on an account manager that will allow you to add accounts etc. much like you do on smartphones etc.\nThat is just the beginning of it all though. Still needs a proper Calendar and Email app.\n. @rubengc I think I have something going here now. The library can now read feeds from online services (in this example contacts). Next would be to create write/modification support and hook it up to the synchronization process.\n\n. @rubengc Have gotten some work done on the calendar implementation. If you have any UI design in mind for this, please let me know :)\nActuall notification and syncing of the events are in progress too!\n\n. @rubengc Just letting you know there is also some good progress on the Email application. You can now list folders and messages, send and recieve messages, download attachments (so far only for Google and no cache has been created).\nIt is also integrated with the Contacts application.\n\n. @rubengc Just thought I'd give you an update.\nI have now moved Google Contacts and Google Mail clients into the extras repository. They are considered \"usable\" by now.\nMail application is only missing a few minor functions (mainly sending of attachments). The contacts is only missing midification/adding of entries.\nI will look at making abstractions (to make it work with, ex. Outlook) for this after a little break. I've been on a week coding binge now and feeling a bit tired :p\n\n. @junland I'll try ;)\n. Now that the Google versions of these client applications are coming along nicely, I will merge this with #15, since this all will be a feature of the official release branch :)\n. Hi @oxeron .\nCurrently there is no calendar component, no.. @oxeron Yeah, it could be done with that library, but I am trying to avoid using jQuery (and things like that). But I'm sure there are lots of alternatives out there.\nIt would definitely be nice to have such a thing, so I will look around. Maybe you could do that too ? :). This was [also] suggested in #100 and moved to #49. Do you have any specific types of widgets in thought ?\n. I think it would be better to make the widgets a \"package\" just like how the applications run. This way it's super easy to maintain them with install/uninstall. Also, then you can decide for yourself where to put the files. You can basically have some cake, and eat it too :) Sounds reasonable ?\nA clock widget would be a nice place to start. Should be pretty stratight forward and easy. Thanks!\n. This can be a store spesific feature. In the manifest for a store item there could be some entries that define an association. That way it works more or less like you described :)\n. @MrSchism \n\nSimple, like Virtual Machine Manager's interface... but instead of VMs, show users.\n\nWhich users ? \n. @MrSchism But do you mean in OS.js or the underlying system ?\n. Yeah, because an OS.js user does not run on the underlying system... so getting any statistics for that would be pretty limited (only what the webserver has). If you had a handler that actually used PAM (which I have tested successfully) you can get some stats if a user actually executes some background tasks etc, but again limited.\nBut yes. The original intent of OS.js was to manage the underlying system. I was using it for virtual machine setups and webservers etc. Had a few D3.js charts going etc to see realtime traffic etc. Maybe I should redo these for v2 ?! ;)\n. @MrSchism I could basically just include a bunch of wrappers and attach them to the API for cases just like this. Sort of like munin (but not that awful custom scripting stuff.... just pure js)\n. @MrSchism Yeah. That'd be nice :)\n. I am closing this issue in favour of #329.\nJust FYI: I've started on an implementation on this that uses a <canvas> based system (so everything scales correctly). So it will not be long until you finally can do this -- but for progress, se #329 :)\n. You can now follow the progress in #479 :)\n. Sorry, but I'm having a rough time understanding this. You mean running OS.js as a [web]server inside the virtual machine ?\n. Aha. Someone actually provided a Vagrant-file which is essentially the same thing :)\n(you just have to download that file and \"start\" it in Vagrant app)\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/INSTALL.md#vargant\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/Vagrantfile\nhttps://www.vagrantup.com/\n. I just realized I have a spelling error there\n. But again, Vagrant will install an entire linux distro that is much larger, so this might be more attractive ;)\n. @MrSchism Looks like you have not installed the dependencies npm install\n. @MrSchism Nice :)\n. @MrSchism Any luck getting it going ? ;)\n. @MrSchism I'm closing the issue because of inactivity. Feel free to resume it if there are any updates!\n. Maybe I should add another button :)\nIt should be like: Yes, No and Cancel.\nSorry about the confusion. Will fix!\n. Will add another button ASAP :)\n. Well, thank you :)\nDen s\u00f8ndag 28. juni 2015 skrev Nathan Johnson notifications@github.com\nf\u00f8lgende:\n\nAlright, cool :)\nI have to say, OS.js is quite amazing. Great job on it!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/issues/124#issuecomment-116181406\n.\n\n\nAnders F. Evenrud\nSoftware Developer\nBlog: http://tinyurl.com/cjfrfx8\n. @NathanCJohnson Fixed so it now gives you the option of yes, no and cancel. Maybe that makes it clearer :)\n. The thing is applications (\"packages\") live in their own git-repository and have a package.json. That is how dependencies are managed. You use \"npm\" and \"git submodules\".\nWhen you start an app in OS.js it will first check the dependencies are loaded (via the provided list in app metadata), if not it will go ahead and do so. It is the package developers responsibility to have everything required to go from there on.\n\nIt would be very nice to install these libraries from the store (or by command line)\n\nCommand line is how it is for now. OS.js does not have any platform spesific GUI utilities at the moment.\nYou just download the package, and on the server-side run \"npm install\" etc. to download all the libraries, dependencies or whatever you have.\n\nThis aspect will be atractive for all developers that want to develop under OSjs\n\nThat is what my main goal is overall. I'm using all of the mainstream developer tools out there: node, npm, grunt, less-css and a very modular prototype based javascript API. So it should not be hard for anyone having at least some knowledge of these tools to get started. I also provide full documentation at http://os.js.org/doc/\u00a8\n:)\n. I forgot: Store applications come as archives and are intended to run fully out of the box. Just like Firefox Marketplace and smartphone apps. So these include all the libraries and dependencies required.\nIf you install them manually from a repo (with full source, docs etc), you have to use the command line to set up the libs/deps... but again is fully automatic with \"npm\" (and/or \"grunt\").\n. @rubengc I forgot to mention another thing. There is a package type of \"extension\" that you can use to include libraries and other extensions.\nExample: http://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-broadway.html\nThis loads a library and hooks up API functions for OS.js (library)\n. I am closing this. If you have any further questions, please post them in #49\n. @khoaakt You got that error because you did not use git with recursive clone. If you follow the documentation it will set up all libraries/dependencies for you :) \"experiments\" is not a package, but a repository with packages. To manage third party stuff automatically I went for git submodules for OS.js package repositories (which is something entirely different than a zip or store application)\nhttp://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-package-manager.html\n. @khoaakt All documentation is on the homepage.\nManuals: http://os.js.org/doc/manuals/\nTutorials: http://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/\nAPI: http://os.js.org/doc/client/\n. That is because you are running it from the wrong directory.\nYou have to be in the root folder then run \"./bin/start-node-dev.sh\" :)\n. @hiccup01 I actually have a TCP/IP wrapper that runs on websocket that works similar to this. I just never added it to OS.js because I considered it very experimental. I'm going to look more into this. Thanks!\n. I will add support for WebTCP.\nDoing a cleanup, so this will be merged with #49 for the time being because it will be a part of the extras repository.\n. cool :)\n. Oh. I had to revert it. Please use https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-store-website\n. I will refactor this before I merge it\n. I'll merge this tomorrow\n. This was merged. No idea why github did not update.\nPlease study the changes I made:\n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/src/packages/default/CoreWM/panel.js#L61\n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/src/packages/default/CoreWM/main.js#L842\nI reduced your code by ~50% :)\n. Is your forked repository deleted or private ?\n. Oh. That was why I had some problems them. Why ? :P\n. @junland :)\n. This will automatically resolve itself after #136 -- All the reloading functions will be in options.\n\"patching\" is a part of the new update\n. @junland :)\n. Blocked by #136\n. I'm closing this for now. Will reopen after gui-ng is finished\n. But I still don't have enough feedback to actaually call it finished :(\n. @ComputeLinux I was just about to look into this... and it seems I have deleted what I made earlier and there is no record of it on github :( So I have to start over... but not to worry, I'm on the case :)\n. @ComputeLinux I've started on this again and this time it will be in it's own repo: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-IDE So follow the progress there :)\n. @ComputeLinux I will now re-open this issue. I have made quite some progress this weekend :)\n. I am closing this issue now because there is a working version in https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-development that you can now use. It's not finished, but you can design your UI with it :)\n. For anyone interested, here is a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPhBpkbeZBU\n. Could you maybe make the INSTALL instructions a bit shorter? Take Vagrant as an example... I assume they already have knowledge on how to use it and just leave a link to the homepage. If there is any extra documentation that you would like to include, just make a md file in doc/ and link to it in INSTALL :)\n. Also, if you could revert the README.md file it would be awesome. I will be updating this in its entirety, so the layout will change.\n. Hm. I was thinking more in the line of:\nDocker\nA docker.io configuration is also included.\nJust use this configuration file and you will be ready to go. For detailed instructions see the separate documentation\n. Even better :) Make sure to download new changes before making a new pull-request\n. Or, actually, start a new pull-request so we avoid commit-message clutter :)\n. @junland Nothing will change, except for the way you write the interface.\nThis way all we have all the different logics separated:\nApplication (JS) -> Window (JS) -> Content (HTML) -> Style (CSS)\n. Right now you have to program the UI, not simply describe it with markup.\n. @MrSchism Glad to hear that. I think this will generate a bit more interrest since HTML is something almost everyone knows :)\n. I have the first iteration comitted in this branch. Expect to see lots of updates here :)\n\nYeah, i know it does not exactly look like anything. But it's just because there are no theming applied yet. These first tests have at least shown that this is doable and that rendering works great! :)\nThe best part is that all of this is done in memory (no repaints), so UI generation should now be a bit quicker and lighter on resources.\nGenerated from this:\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/gui-ng/src/packages/default/ngui/scheme.html\n. @MrSchism @junland \nJust a little status update for you guys. Getting a lot of nice progress here. I have almost finished adding all the GUI elements to the parser and stylesheets.\nNext up is event binding and modifier methods :)\nLook mom. No CSS or JavaScript!\n\n. Everything is 100% dynamic, and you can specify rules for each container\n(grow, shrink, fill-content, expand-content etc).\nI don't know if you have ever worked with Gtk/Glade, but I now have\nsomething very (very) simular to that.\nDen tirsdag 28. juli 2015 skrev John Unland notifications@github.com\nf\u00f8lgende:\n\n@andersevenrud https://github.com/andersevenrud Looks good. Does it\nscale (Or does it have) when resizing?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/issues/136#issuecomment-125628096\n.\n\n\nAnders F. Evenrud\nSoftware Developer\nBlog: http://tinyurl.com/cjfrfx8\n. So, most of the groundwork is now done! You can actually design an entire application with this (except for the stuff obviously missing -- in the description). :smile:\nI have added a screenshot in the description, including a link to the scheme file used for creating those two windows.\nIs there anybody that could go over the scheme file (you can ignore the first window, se the second one) and see if it looks OK ? I mean, like naming convensions and stuff.\nTo clear this up imediately, the params for hbox/vbox are:\n```\ngrow = If the container should grow (part of flexbox spec)\nshrink = If the container should shrink (part of flexbox spec)\nbasis = Default size of container (part of flexbox spec)\nfill = If the content should fill the entire container\nexpand = If the content should just fill horizontal/vertical space (depending on box used)\n```\n. @junland No comments, at all ? ;)\n. @junland \nGreat. I was trying to make it as future-proof as possible. \nThe first three attributes are a part of the flexbox spec (I only removed the prefix \"flex-*\"). These are not enabled states, but rather a number representing the proportion. Basis is sort of the \"Initial size\".\nOriginally I had the two lasts ones as \"fill-content\" and \"expand-content\", but I simply do not know which is better... \"fill\", \"fill-content\" or \"fill-enabled\".\nDuely noted though. Will wait and see if anyone else comments on this before actually changing anything. \n. Event binding is in place and all elements have been implemented! Technically, this is ready for use now (so if you want you can clone this branch and do some experiments in the provided example application.), but still has some undone features.\n... but I'm sure some things will come up now that I'm starting to rewrite all of the Dialogs.\nIf things go as easy as they have -- I will have a commit on the master branch this weekend :smile:\n. @junland Don't know if you already checked it out, but I have made some updates.\nEverything is chainable now and property getting/setting should work properly. This should please the jQuery crowd (or at least make them feel at home) :D \nscheme.find(this, 'MyText').set('value', 'Default text').on('enter', function() {\n  alert(\"You pressed enter with value: \" + this.get('value');\n}).on('change', function() {\n  console.log('text has changed, update something');\n});\n. @junland Well, personally I am not a fan of jQuery, but it have some nice patterns. I especially like the chainable methods (allthough it can make code ugly).\nBut learning this is not hard at all. The entire library consists of these methods only: find(), get(), set() and on(). The rest is all HTML :D\n. @MrSchism I am pinging you to see if you have any input on all of this (or general feelings) :)\n. After 3K lines of JavaScript, 1.5K lines of CSS and some [almost] sleepless nights -- this thing has come a looooong way!\nI have recreated all the old Elements and Dialogs, and will now start on re-creating all the applications.\nCore codebase complexity has been reduced a lot... and I gotta say. This is pretty sweet!\nJust look at the scheme file for all of the dialogs: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/gui-ng/src/javascript/dialogs/schemes.html \n. @rubengc FYI! Theming will be much simpler when I'm done here :)\n. Good news everyone!\n\nI can see a faint light in the end of the tunnel! Most of the groundwork is complete and I have started rewriting the default application packages. So far things are going very smoothly and it looks like I'm half way there :smile:\n. @khoaakt Rewriting 60% of the project is a lot of work, indeed! :) But hopefully it was worth it.\nI will have a release ready by this weekend (assuming my job does not take up all my free time) :smile:\n. @junland Aww :)\n. @khoaakt Not only new GUI Framework, but also Dialog framework and Event binding/dispatching.\nEverything has been unified and simplified, so it should now take almost no effort to actually quickly design something. You can do this with HTML, JavaScript, or both. In most cases, no CSS is required at all because the layout is now rendered with 100% flexboxes... which also make it very dynamic and scalable. Also the general API is now chainable and has very few methods.\nIf you look at the FileManager -- maybe you see a few things that remind you of jQuery (or similar libraries):\n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/gui-ng/src/packages/default/FileManager/main.js\nAlso, this is what builds the entire UI. Before this was all code, but now just a little bit of markup:\n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/gui-ng/src/packages/default/FileManager/scheme.html\n. @khoaakt And I forgot, the theme \"engine\" has also been rewritten and is a lot better.\n. Look at the scheme file for the Settings application: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/gui-ng/src/packages/default/Settings/scheme.html\n... then try to imagine how much code that was used in the previous version to actually make it work and look like it did.\nYeah... I gotta admit -- this is pretty cool :)\n. Anyone up for some testing ?\nI'll be wrapping up today for a test-release! :)\n. Nice! I'm just going to work out a few minor things here... then I can set up a VPS or something to make it easier to properly organize this :)\n. @junland Servers are no problem. I have VIP accounts on one of the cloud stacks at work, so I'll just set up a virtual machine (same as current demo) :)\n. Test server is: http://osjsv2-test.0o.no/\nDon't bother testing Firefox Marketplace because it does not work on this domain.\n\nI have not set up any DNS here, so you have to edit your hosts file (as admin):\nWindows: C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\nNIX: /etc/hosts\nSimply add this domain:\n91.229.143.135 osjsv2-test.0o.no\n. @junland \nDid not find any technical glitches or bugs ? :) I actually found a few minor ones just as I deployed the thing, hehe.\n\nMusic Player works however it does not have a time display a time slider so I can go forwards or backwards in the song. All I can do is pause / play the song.\n\nSeeking is not available simply because the server is not configured for it. I'm adding something custom later. Some fileformats supports seeking in the browser, but others use the server.\n\nPlacing the menu bar on the bottom chops the bottom most of the app menu. (Firefox / Chrome)\n\nI thought I had a check for that. Maybe my math is off. Investegating!\n\nThe glitch graphic glitch that messed up the screen when rotating the screen from landscape to portrait seems to be gone. (Phone / Tablet)\nApp menu is slightly sliced off , this happens in both portrait and landscape modes. (Phone Only) (Chrome)\n\nNo mobile CSS or functionality has been done yet. Only touch support.\nFor mobile I'd have to implement a fully custom solution simply because of the lack of screen real-estate.\n. @junland\n\nPlacing the menu bar on the bottom chops the bottom most of the app menu. (Firefox / Chrome)\n\nOpsie. Spelling error :D window.innerHeigth\n. @junland \n\nPressing tab key in Writter app makes the cursor disappear and I can type text into it. However it's fixed by just pressing backspace.\n\nNot able to reproduce this one. Might be a platform spesific issue. Will have to investegate further.\nIt is a bit weird that backspace fixes it because that key is not special like the Tab which is designed to jump to next/previous field.\nFirefox, or Chrome ?\n. > Well I updated after the latest changes, on the phone it fixed the chopping of the app menu but that only works in landscape mode, portrait mode still has the same problem. However when you do activate the app menu in landscape mode then rotate it to portrait it fixes it but it leaves a large black box at the bottom and has some artifacts.\nYeah. But as I stated earlier there is no actual customized UI for the mobile platforms yet, so it will be ugly no matter what device.\n\nLooks like it's just a tab order or something. :)\n\nThat is just the thing though, there is no tab ordering. It has all been disabled because the browser default events will not work in this case as they were intended for basic HTML forms (Example: you have tabs with multiple inputs, if you tab until an input in another tab is selected it will not work because it is \"invisible\", so some custom detection must be done).\nIt's most likely a platform spesific issue. I'm guessing the event is not blocked properly. I'll have to fire up some VMs and do some extensive testing on that.\n. @junland \n\nSorry about that, didn't parse that correctly :)\n\nNo worries. I'm no communications expert, hehe :P \n\nYea, it's a minor bug but shouldn't hinder the release of the beta. :)\n\nStill alpha, though :/ Just going to increment the release number. There are so many things left undone... but now at least 50% of that was done.\n. @junland Did you get the Tab bug on Windows or Linux ?\nI have just tried a completely fresh Ubuntu installation and Windows 7, but not able to reproduce. It worries me a bit... hm!\n. @junland What distro and Desktop Environment ? Also browser + version\n. @junland I just committed something that might help. Care to test again ?\n. Oh shit. You said Writer app... I missed that. Opsie. I will fix that!\n. @junland Like a textbox or something in Textpad.\nTry again now. Applied a fix to the richtext editor element used in Writer.\n. @junland \n\nNope, now it doesn't highlight the tab, but still no tab :(.\n\nWut ?\n\npoint out that Textpad can tab through text so maybe look at that one.\n\nThe Textarea and Richtext are two entirely different things. In fact, the richtext is not a text area at all, but a editable HTML area. So the same rules does not apply here :/\nI cannot reproduce the problem anymore on any of my virtual machines or browsers. I was before the commit. Are you using the demo site or local setup ?\n. > Previously to the new changes, when I would press tab in Writer the cursor would highlight the active tab in my browser. Now with the new changes it isn't doing that.\nGood. Then it was solved! If OS.js now no longer loses focus.\nI do realize the tab character is not inserted before the cursor, but Richtext implementation is far from done :)\n. @junland \n\nLocal...I am doing a grunt command after each pull and using the start-node-dev.sh\n\nIf you are using dist-dev you don't have to do this unless a theme has changes or server patches were done. So if you look when you do a git pull and src/themes and src/server-* was not changes, just reload browser! :)\n. Thanks for the help boys!\nSquashed quite a few bugs today :) I also managed to come a long way on the extra and experimental apps. I think I will finish the code editor and the Gmail client, then head for a release! I can take care of the rest later.\nI need a break soon, hehe.\nBut, if anyone is interested in helping out more tomorror (or whatever depending on timezone), let me know :)\n. @junland Nice! +1\n. @junland Ever time there is a spike, someone has posted it on reddit, hehe :) I hope your inbox is not full of crap :P\n. @junland Yeah, there are few people out there doing stuff like this on their own :) Maybe some of them decides to join in on the fun some day.\nAnyway. Up for some more testing ? I will be doing a merge today if all goes well. My biggest merge yet, I think. Will be exciting to se how well it goes :)\n. @junland I should have fixed every breaking/glitching bug. But try to dig deep and look if there is something there :)\n. @junland \n\nPutting the panel on the bottom and enabling the touch menu covers the better half of the panel.\n\nShould be fixed now\n\nWhen saving a file in Textpad I can't highlight the default / place cursor to erase it the name, I have to scroll with the arrow keys to clear the text area.\n\nWill check\n\nWhen renaming a file in Textpad (Using the \"Save as\") it creates a duplicate file but with the new name. This also happens in the Writer app.\n\nDuplicate ? The behaviour of \"Save As\" is to create a new file... it does not delete the old file. Am I missing somehting here ?\n\nWriter, Textpad, and Draw don't prompt you if want to save if you have entered text or drawings into there application.\n\nYup. This is noted above in the TODO list\n\nWhen logging out with all applications opened I am prompted if I wanted to save my session. Picking \"Yes\" starts up all the applications that I opened, but when clicking \"No\" and logging back in, it brings back my current session with the applications.\nClosing all the applications then signing out without saving the session it still opens all the applications that I have closed when signing back on.\n\nMaybe some clarification in the text is required. It asks if you want to save current session. So no means.... well, no. And that will not erase the previous session. Maybe adding a checkbox or something there would be nice also.\n. @junland \n\nWhen saving a file in Textpad I can't highlight the default / place cursor to erase it the name, I have to scroll with the arrow keys to clear the text area.\n\nFixed (I think)\n. @junland \n\nAh okay, it does the same thing when I do it in Geddit. I guess I said that because in Windows it just rewrites over the original file with the new name..... My bad. lol\n\nIt does ? I don't think I have ever experienced that, becase \"As...\" means \"new\" in a sense :p \n\nYea, whoops. I'll take a look at it. It's still kinda the morning, I haven't woken up. :P\n\nI'm having the same problem... except it the clock is soon 20:00. hehe\n. @khoaakt Please don't spam and keep patient. I was getting around to you.\nLocales are not 100% implemented in this build and is currently what I am working on.\n. @khoaakt The locales is now hooked up. Some stuff is missing translations, but I will make a list of it in a separate issue.\n. @junland \n\nWriter, Textpad, and Draw don't prompt you if want to save if you have entered text or drawings into there application.\n\nYou will now get a confirmation dialog if you try to close, open or create new file when content has been altered.\nNote that it is only implemented in the Textpad application so far, but the ground-work is layed for the others :) Could you test it maybe ?\nIt seems that this is ready for a merge now Oo I am a bit scared. Care to take a few minutes to perfrom a final test ?\n. @junland Opsie. I forgot about Grunt build. Fixed now. Just run grunt core :)\n. @junland I also added the confirmation to Writer application. Note that this is a bit wonky since it detects changes on an interval... So if you write something and very quickly press close it will not catch it... but it's better than nothing.\n. @junland Well.... Then I guess all that is left is to merge this sucker!\nI am a bit scared, actually. But this version feels better even though some minor stuff is missing, wouldn't you agree ? (And should contain lots less boxes especially graphical stuff)\nDo you think it is ready for merge ?\n. .... drumroll!\n. Aaaaand it has been merged in d9708d672b6a57d1a2f10aeb21c21deaaabb2149 :smile:\n. Regenerated documentation: http://os.js.org/doc/client/\n. Everything has been merged and demo-site was updated: http://osjsv2.0o.no/\nYou might have to clear cache for it to work propertly. The rules are a bit strict on the server to reduce load.\n. @junland https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/wiki/Hall-of-Fame#testers-and-helpers A well-deserved spot :)\n. Rendering is broken on iOS 7.1.1. It is really old, so I will upgrade and check back in.\n. @rubengc Interested in doing some Themes ?\n.  Added \"Applications\" as a VFS module so you can browse them with the File Manager. This also re-adds support for dragging launchers to your desktop (if icon view is enabled)\n. Updated iOS compability. Still a bit wonky, but at least now base layout is rendering. Next up the iconview/listview/treeview\n. @junland Could you do me a favour and test OS.js on your mobile after the updates I've made recently. Just interrested in if it still looks exactly the same. I finally fixed the iOS rendering errors :D\n. @junland Strange. It works on my Android device :/\nUsing a local build? Try the demo... if it works better yout might have missed something in the update process\n. @junland Also tried 4.4.2 on the emulator. Seems to work fine.\n. @khoaakt You might be glad to see this ;)\n\n. @junland Tried running grunt to regenerate everything ?\n. @junland Lol. I think it might be because you're running with outdated settings in your cache :D\nTry to clear it.\nIn Chrome you can do \"Developer Tools\" > \"Resources\" > \"Local Storage\" and delete the entries.\nI must introduce some versioning system here.\n. @junland I just added a commit that resets the settings when I change the version number :)\n. @junland Screenshot ?\n. @junland Also, check \"Network\" tab in developer tools and look for 404s\n. @junland It says 404 on \"themes/styles/default.css\" so it is a missing theme file. Running either grunt or simply grunt themes should solve this though\n. @junland Also, are you running the latest sources ?\n. @junland Very strange. I'd guess it was a permission error or something so the theme file was not written successfully or something. I'd really like to know what the problem was to replicate it... hmm.\n. @junland The error might have been supressed if an exception occured. Grunt is very bad at that apparently. Will try to add some catches in the Gruntfile\n. I am retireting this issue because all of the features are complete. The rest of this will be referred in #49.\nThanks for all the support guys. You rock! :metal:\n. \"Grub\" ?! I don't know what I was thinking :D\n. Great stuff! Is there anyway to hook the plugins up to the Vagrant config file (to make them install automatically) ?\n. Allright :)\n. Is there a way to set up a \"repository\" like with Docker ? So you don't have to use the Vagrantfile, but an URL ?\n. Allright! I will change the text in install slightly though\n. The result:\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/INSTALL.md\nBasically, when I write installation documentation I make quite a few assumtions to avoid any clutter.\nI, mean. If you have not heard about docker or know how to set it up, you'd probably want to use the official docs :)\n. At the moment you have to execute it from the root directory as the documentation says, but I will fix it so it auto-detects :)\n. Not a native English speaker here. Thank you very much, good sir :)\n. Haha. Yeah! This is a known problem. Before capping the upload limit it was used as a filesharing service. The server is on a 100Mbit connection, so it is a nice way to share stuff :P \nWas there more than just the porn folder ? I deleted that one at least\n. If someone is up for some coding, let me know! I'd really like to have a scrubber going in a cron :)\n. > Where is the /shared folder even stored?\n./vfs/public\n. ./vfs/home/demo for the demo server\n. This never came to mind! I'll add that in the new branch #136 :)\n. Added in commit ab90805fb67460034ce328703215858673b895cc :)\nWill be a part of the next merge!\n. Look in the \"Settings\" application ?\n. Please not that this menu is a placeholder. It will become much better in a later update\n. Allright!\n. Make sure they have an appropriate License that is compatible with OS.js\n. Great stuff! Could you possibly translate the other components of OS.js ? :)\n. +1\nI have a wiki page for exactly this: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/wiki/Join-the-translation-team\nAlso and issue if you want to discuss the topic: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/issues/18\n. I will probably leave this pull-request open in case more changes comes in :)\n. Looks good. I'll merge this now since it has the most important stuff in place.\nThanks a million!\n. https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/wiki/Hall-of-Fame\n. Awesome :D\n. @RyanRiffle I'd also like the actual storing of settings a bit abstract so you can easily hook up a AJAX call or similar. The default way should be \"localStorage\" imo. So make it support async callbacks\n. @RyanRiffle \nI myself am a much bigger fan of a singleton style interface, so you don't have a ton of \"UserSettings\" instances going. But we could do the best of two worlds\n```\nvar s = UserSettings.instance('MyStoragePool');\ns.set(someKey, someValue);\n// ...\n```\nThen just have these as the primary static methods and make class above use them:\n```\nUserSettings.load('MyStoragePool', callback);\nUserSettings.set('MyStoragePool', fullTree); // For setting entire tree\nUserSettings.set('MyStoragePool', fullTree, {merge: true}); // For merging instead of setting\nUserSettings.set('MyStoragePool', someKey, someValue); // For setting by key inside the tree\nUserSettings.get('MyStoragePool'); // Gets entire tree\nUserSettings.get('MyStoragePool', someKey); // For getting valye by key inside tree\nUserSettings.save('MyStoragePool');\n```\n. I made a small mistake above. edited\n. > Possibly even an event handler to notify when a certain setting has changed, in case the settings could change through say the System > Settings dialog.\nI like the idea of having events there.\n\nIt would actually hold all of the settings needed and be a buffer between the client and server.\n\nI'm not 100% sure what you mean\n. That's actually exactly how it works now, even though it might not look like it. It's just been abstracted down to the  Handler which was fitting at the time.\nSo this will be a nice change. Reduces complexity by three steps, though not visible to the end-user.\nBut still I'd like to have access like I described. This is very handy for example in some of the global  API functions.\nI've already started tearing the code apart, so would be nice to settle on something.\n. I feel that having three interfaces is redundant and could lead to even more confusion.\nApplications already have storage functions that are bound to the SettingsManager. So no extra class is needed... you just do this._getSetting(key); this._setSetting(key, value, save?);\n\nSettings -- For the core API to access things individually (your singleton interface)\n\nI'm not sure I understand why here... Just make SettingsManager the singleton interface. Then create a method that returns a pseudo \"settings\" object that access these methods.\nAt least this is what I think is the most optimal solution.\nExample code:\n```\n/*\n * The one and only object\n /\nfunction SettingsManager() {\n  this.storage = {};\n}\nSettingsManager.get = function(pool, key) {\n  return key ? this.storage[pool] : this.storage[pool][key];\n};\nSettingsManager.set = function(pool, key, value) {\n  if ( arguments.length > 1 ) {\n    this.storage[pool][key] = value;\n  } else {\n    this.storage[pool];\n  }\n};\nSettingsManager.setPoolDefaults = function(pool, defaults) {\n  // ...\n};\n/*\n * For creating a wrapper so you don't have to specify which pool to use (aka proxy)\n /\nSettingsManager.instance = function(pool, defaultStorage) {\n  SettingsManager.setPoolDefaults(pool, defaultStorage);\nreturn {\n    set: function(key, val) { return SettingsManager.set(pool, key, val); },\n    get: function(key) { return SettingsManager.get(pool, key); }\n    // ... and so on ...\n  };\n};\n```\nUsage:\n```\n// Method 1:\nSettingsManager.set('MyPool', 'foo', 'bar');\n// Method 2:\nvar settings = SettingsManager.instance('MyPool');\nsettings.set('foo', 'bar');\n```\n. @RyanRiffle Yeah. I feel this is very optimal. Low on code, one interface, one set of documentation, one set of methods that are the same statically or with an instanciated object.\nI think this was originally how it was but I started over-thinking stuff because of customization ideas... but that turned into spaghetti :P \nSo if we stick with something like this I can eliminiate 20-30 methods in the codebase! :D \n. @RyanRiffle Glad to hear that :)\n. @RyanRiffle I've basically finished the new SettingsManager implementation :)\nStill though, CoreWM settings tree has not been updated. Looking forward to see how you're planning this.\n\nYou can now customize loading and saving functions via the Handler just as previously instead of configuring it in src/conf.\nThis way the handler still has the responsibility of the connection and settings storage and makes it very easy to customize (like with the included example handler that uses AJAX and a remote mysql database for user and settings storage).\n. @RyanRiffle \nFYI!\nThe method for getting SettingsManger is now: OSjs.Core.getSettingsManager()\nSo: \n```\nOSjs.Core.getSettingsManager().instance('MyPoolName'); // and so on\n```\n. @RyanRiffle I will also merge this into master now, so you can change to that branch.... Sorry for any inconveniences this might make for you :/\n. Docs have been updated http://os.js.org/doc/client/\n. @RyanRiffle I still feel kind of bad for going all out here, and would really like your opinion on the end-result.\nI'd also like to know if you \"got heard\" and feel that you actually contributed to the process.... my god. I'm starting to sound like a customer feedback caller :D \nThis issue will be left open and if you'd like any changes I am totally open to that. Noting is set in stone here, but in the end we got very solid groud-work done!\n. I have updated description with details on how it now all works\n. You'll also get this one for now. If you have any news about progress or whatever, let me know here :)\n. @RyanRiffle Yep. Maybe something like:\nOSjs.Core.getSettingsManager().watch(function(changedPool, tree) {\n  // Update settings input elements\n});\n. This is done too! :+1: \n. Ref #151\nWill look at the circular error you got now\n. https://github.com/RyanRiffle/OS.js-v2/blob/PanelItem_Settings/src/client/javascript/helpers/settings-fragment.js#L57\nChange this to:\n```\n  /*\n   * set(key, val) - Sets an entry\n   * set(null, tree) - Sets entire tree\n   /\n  SettingsFragment.prototype.set = function(key, value) {\n    if ( arguments.length < 2 ) {\n      throw new Error('SettingsFragment::set() needs two parameters');\n    }\n// This was setting [null] = myself; basically\nif ( !key ) {\n  this._settings = value; // The \n} else {\n  this._settings[key] = value;\n}\n\n};\n```\n\n. Well... There are two solutions... Works the same, but is subjective. So you pick whatever you like best :P\n```\n/*\n   * set(key, val) - Sets an entry\n   * set(null, tree) - Sets entire tree\n   /\n  SettingsFragment.prototype.set = function(key, value) {\n    if ( arguments.length < 2 ) {\n      throw new Error('SettingsFragment::set() needs two parameters');\n    }\n// This was setting [null] = myself; basically\nif ( arguments.length === 1 ) {\n  this._settings = value;\n} else {\n  if ( key ) {\n    this._settings[key] = value;\n  }\n}\n\n};\n```\n:\n```\n  SettingsFragment.prototype.set = function(key, value) {\n    if ( !key ) {\n      throw new Error('SettingsFragment::set() needs a key/value');\n    }\nif ( arguments.length === 1 ) {\n  this._settings = key;\n} else {\n  this._settings[key] = value;\n}\n\n};\n```\n. In case you wanted to know what the trigger is and needs to be fixed, look at:\nWindowManager.prototype.applySettings = function(settings, force, save) {\n    // ...\n    this._settings.set(null, result, save);\n    // ...\n  };\nChange to:\nWindowManager.prototype.applySettings = function(settings, force, save) {\n    // ...\n    this._settings.set(result);\n    if ( save ) {\n      this._settings.save();\n    }\n    // ...\n  };\n. Also. I see now that settings-manager.js is basically empty.\nSo it might be best to put settings-fragment code in there.\n. Nice job! :+1:\nI moved the clock dialog scheme into \"CoreWM/scheme.html\". Mostly because it removes some code and that opening the dialog is now showing instantly (because it was cached upon boot).\n. @RyanRiffle Also, I added so \"Settings\" updates if you change the settings tree with the watch() function. \n. Oh. Ill fix that one.\nI notice you are using \"dist\" and not \"dist-dev\". Using the latter will\nsave you from rebuilding every time you change something...

Evenrud\nSoftware Developer\nBlog: http://tinyurl.com/cjfrfx8\n. Awesome! I was just about to ask for INSTALL file :)\n. Could you make the scheme file use double quotes ? I think it looks better that way\n. Also, could you please do:\nif (typeof this._settings[key] !== 'undefined') where these checks are done ? \"=== undefined\" will produce a lint error :)\n. You can copy-paste into here: http://jshint.com/\nOr even better set up a plugin for your editor :) I use https://www.bithound.io/github/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/master for managing all linting and techdept. Pretty awesome stuff actually.\n. Is this mergable now, or is more commits coming ?\n. Will be doing a thurough test when I get off work and merge this :+1: \n. Seems to be working like a charm\nNice job! :)\n. I added docu to the settings-fragment\n. @RyanRiffle In latest commit I have made abstraction for the settings stuff. So now everything is mostly done in PanelItem.\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/e229b96e056e73ab504465d6409d532fa47a5e53/src/packages/default/CoreWM/panelitems/clock.js\n. @RyanRiffle It has changed a little bit after a few more commits, but basically the same :)\n. The behaviour of argumentDefaults is a bit different (rules), but could be done with mergeObject in some way:\n- All numbers/booleans defined with null or undefined uses default value\n- Anything else that has a value of !value uses default value\nSo it's not a merge, more of a gap-filler. I don't know if this made any sense :P \n. Forget the last comment. Correction:\nFor example:\nUtils.argumentDefaults({\n  allHailCthulu: null,\n  motherHydra: 0\n}, {\n  allHailCthulu: 666,\n  motherHydra: 10,\n  oDagon: true\n});\nwould return\n{\n  allHailCthulu: 666,\n  motherHydra: 0,\n  oDagon: true\n}\n. Without these rules, this would happen:\nUtils.argumentDefaults({\n  allHailCthulu: 0\n}, {\n  allHailCthulu: 666\n});\nwould return\n{\n  allHailCthulu: 666 // SHOULD BE 0 !\n}\n. allrighty then!\n. @RyanRiffle Just the 'panels' pool inside 'CoreWM'. It's because of the way items are done in Settings. Should I look at it, or do you want to have a stab at it ?\n. Should be fixed now (demo site is cached, so might have to refresh two times to make it update).\n. It looks like I need to add some more info to my INSTALL file, because this comes up very often :)\nYou are running with the dist build which requires you to rebuild if you add/modify something in the code. If you want to rebuild just your package simply do grunt packages:default/MyPackageName.\nIf you use dist-dev you don't have to do this, and is very usefull for development purposes. This will make OS.js run straight from source.\n. Please let me know if this solved your problem or if you are still wondering about something :)\n. @sercul Yeah. That tuturoial needs some updates and I have totally missed some errors in it :( Sorry about that.\n```\nscheme.find(this, 'MyButtonOne').on('click', function() {\n    alert(scheme.find(this, 'Text').get('value')); // <-- Change to 'self' instead of this\n  });\n```\n. I fixed those mistakes in the documentation. Thanks for letting me know\n. Closing issue because of idle-time\n. Could you make it a pull request ? :)\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/src/installer/installer.sh\n. Thanks :)\n. Thanks! :)\nSolved in the extras repository: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-extras/commit/4e4261d2627b0d9572b7e483d9a97fbed27f3db4\n. That actually means evevrything went OK. It makes sense that you thought something went wrong.\nI will add a message when loading is complete telling you server is running :)\n. @NikosEfthias Thanks for letting me know.

So that means the packages and manifest is actually loaded. Hmm.\nWere there any errors in the console ? Or the \"Network\" tab ?\nI just did a fresh installation and I cannot replicate it. What browser re you using ?\nTry running the developer server: ./bin/start-node-dev.sh (allthough it should not make any difference... but hey, worth trying. That will narrow it down)\n. The 404s you get there are totally normal.\nI also run latest Chrome stable. I even tested this on OSX and Windows (IE included) now... and I cannot replicate... which is strange -- and worries me a bit.\nIn src/packages/default/CoreWM/menu.js -- Line 228:\nSet a breakpoint (if you know how to use the debugger) or simply add this after this line:\nvar list = doBuildCategoryMenu(ev); // <- 228\nconsole.warn('MENU RESULT', list);\nThen reload page (use the developer server so you don't have to rebuild anything) and click the menu.\n. Inspect the list and see what you get. If you set a breakpoint on the next line (or just step one instruction forward), you should get something like:\n\n. I see. Try to put this in the console: OSjs.Core.getPackageManager().getPackages();\n. Aha. So we have narrowed it down to that spesific method (src/client/javascript/package-manager.js).\nJust for fun, try running: OSjs.Core.getPackageManager().getPackages(true);. This should return the metadata we saw earlier.\n. Wow... This is strange.\nSearch for PackageManager::_addPackages() in the browser console output. This line should display what pacakages it was trying to add (almost in the beginning of output. This only works with dev server since it includes console messages)\n\n. By \"output\" I mean the javascript console.\nReload OS.js in the browser, then open the console, CTRL+F to search the console messages.\nSearch for PackageManager::_addPackages()\n. That's not the correct line. Here is a bigger screenshot with annotation to illustrate:\n\n. So, it actually loads the manifest and the package manager recieves them just fine. So the problem must be this function.... which don't makes sense to me. This has always worked!\nOn line 298 in src/client/javascript/package-manager.js, insert this:\n```\n295       newIter.scope = scope || 'system';\n 296       newIter.type  = newIter.type || 'application';\n 297\n 298       console.warn('ADDING PACKAGE', i, newIter); // <- add this\n 299\n 300       self.packages[i] = newIter;\n```\n. I have to leave for ~1hr. Will come back to you as soon as I get back!\n. Did you get any logs in the console after adding that ?\n. You didn't? Then that function is broken somehow!\nClient API: http://os.js.org/doc/client/\nServer API: http://os.js.org/doc/server/\nSome manuals: http://os.js.org/doc/manuals/\nSome tutorials: http://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/\nIf you feel like something is missing... let me know and I'll try my best to make some new documents. I-ve not had much time to write stuff like this... so it's a bit lacking at the moment\n. > nope aactually i didnt have so much time to dig inside code so much \nOr did you mean that you did not do what I commented on ? Having a rough time reading some of your sentences since they lack punctuation -- and English is not my mother language :)\n. My personal Facebook profile is private, so you most likely added my Facebook Developer Account, which I don't use :)\n. Not much into social media, but if you send me a mail or something with your FB profile I can add you :)\n. I'm closing this for now. No more reports of this has come in, and I have deployed OS.js on countless systems without getting it myself -- so I am going to assume this was a cahcing issue (as we discussed).\nThanks for your effort in resolving this though :)\n. I also fixed so grunt themes:fonts copies the static files as well as compiles the stylesheets :)\n. It should be added to https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/src/conf/110-client.json as well so that it's selectable by user.\n. My bad... it was not needed. I forgot that it will be added automatically :)\n. I might actually remove the \"Karla\" font as its UTF support is not that good\n. Nice! I'll check it out when I get home again :)\n. Currently really busy with something at work, but I hope to take a look at your stuff by the end of this week. Sorry about the delays :/\n. > Transform(from css) needs prefixes to work on old browsers.\nI don't support browsers :)\n. Nice :)\n. Did you look into the comments I made on gitter ? :)\n. @TheMightyCraken I will have a look later today. I forgot all about it :/\n. Here are some comments: http://i.imgur.com/pyXV2Ki.jpg\nOther than that, it looks good! :) It will look really good with per-application styles also.\nI think I will modify the File Manager first to make it look like sort of what I initially envisioned (notice the two views sort of blending together as they do on the Android interfaces and such):\n\n. I don't remember what comments I had earlier on this, but it seems that you've pretty much fixed it all.\n. Allright! :+1: \n. @TheMightyCraken It is now (you might have to clear browser cache if you visited the demo before) :)\n. I am closing this issue, because it belongs to a forker repository. Any updates will be handled internally by the designated team.\n. Ops. I actually fixed this quite a while ago, but it seems that I might have accedentally removed it somehow. Thanks :)\n. Those two apps looks pretty sweet btw :+1: \n. Thanks!\n. Ah, yes. The \"App Store\" is not working on the public demo :)\n. I see that too! Thanks :)\n. The App Store is a work in progress btw, and I think the test application that is there is outdated. But at least this spesific error was fixed\n. :) Fixed :+1: \n. @1j01 Yes. You can actually customize the clock (right click on it), hence the dynamic size. Since it does not use a monospaced font it is really hard do \"calculate\" the actual required width. If you have any ideas let me know\n. @1j01  I guess I could just multiply the font-size by 1.2 and then by the number of characters. Then we'd be pretty safe -- I think!\n. Using getComputedStyle() in this case would just be the same as looking at offsetWidth and that would not help actually since the actual width depends on what characters are displayed.\nThe only way to have a static width is to do a really rough calculation based on the given format that is set. Or change to a monospaced equal-width font just for the clock.\n. @1j01 But how do you know \"8\" is the widest character ? It all depends on the font used.\nThe only \"proper\" solution is to make it a choice to use a monospaced font, or just set a static width (and another option for \"calculated\").\n. This seems to be working good enough:\n``` javascript\nvar tst = OSjs.Helpers.Date.format(new Date(), fmt).replace(/[A-z0-9]/g, '8');\nvar tstEl = document.createElement('span');\ntstEl.style.visibility = 'hidden';\ntstEl.appendChild(document.createTextNode(tst));\ndocument.body.appendChild(tstEl);\nif ( tstEl.offsetWidth ) {\n  clock.style.width = tstEl.offsetWidth.toString() + 'px';\n} else {\n  clock.style.width = '';\n}\ntstEl = Utils.$remove(tstEl);\n\n``\n. Is the file saved as.odoc` ?\n. I cannot replicate this error on my local machine.

This should be fixed in https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-extras/commit/d0a34d0e4e7dbd7b7054e7e9dd776e7320b11a39\nI will update the demo server today at some point\n. @MarkWalls I have updated the demo server, so it should work now (allthough you might have to clear your browser cache for it to refresh code properly... it happens sometimes)\n. I'm not sure that I understand what you mean by \"splitting from the actual operation\". Could you elaborate ? :)\n. When you run OS.js in standalone mode you're effectively running without a backend, hence the missing functionallity (basically external HTTP calls and filesystem functionality).\nI am definately going to make better support for static web servers (such as NW.js, which I have tested). This will involve making a VFS module first so you can manipulate files etc.\n\nWhat I ask for is to isolate this backend functionality (maybe in its own project? One for Node.js and another for PHP?) and remove the static web server part from the OS.js server leaving only the operational one.\n\nSo, basically take src/server/ and split them into separate repos ?\n. > I was asking more about the servers only having the backend functionality\n\nand remove their static file functionality, \n\nAha! Now I get it. That is something that never crossed my mind. I will definately look more into this. Thanks :)\n. I got around to solving this :) NW.js builds now have access to the backend functionality also!\n. >  The backend functionality is in a different process from the one of NW.js, isn't it? \nMaking a NW build will bake the \"backend functionality\" into the it a npm module. The client detects that it is running in NW and will pass all requests trought that module.\n. Yep!\n. Not yet, but I plan to separate it today at some point :)\nThat issue seems more frontend oriented though... or am I missing something ?\n. I'm closing this issue now, because it has been resolved. The backend is now totally separated and protable.\nI will make it a published npm package when documentation is done.\nThanks for initiating this :)\n. Will do!\n. The docs are up here btw: http://os.js.org/doc/server/ :)\n. Yeah, it is really simple!\nWebDAV is supported by the client :)\nThe custom server-side file handling is made this way to allow multiple types of endpoints with minimal configuration. This way you don't have to rely on only (ex) WebDAV for file access (pretty vaguely explained... but hope you get the idea)\n. > Ok, so the client can be configured to use WebDAV as file backend the same way it's able to use GDrive or Dropbox, isn't it?\nYep :)\n\nBut is it needed the OS.js file server to have access to the files from the client, or is optional?\n\nIt is completely optional!\n\nI think I'll need an arrows-and-boxes graph to understand the architecture of OS.js... :-P\n\nI had one, but it is now very outdated. Another one in the works! I will notify you when done :)\n. This is the first draft of how the Server APIs work :P\n\n. @lite20 Extensions is a pretty generic term... there's lots of different types :P But you can add/modify API and VFS methods with them.\n@piranna You can route Resources over the general Filesystem (VFS) if you want. This graph is only showing the default setup.\nI will look into Davius :D\n. I have a Terminal application here https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-extras that works fairly well :)\n\nthe require function which works like node's require\n\nThis could by simply loading requirejs, couldnt it ?\n\nan implementation of the standard node API such as fs and http (of course not everything is possible but most of the stuff actually is and implementations for the browser already exsit)\n\nOS.js already have a filesystem abstraction layer that works very similar to nodes.\nI am planning to add more CLI tools and such (which is in progress on another branch), so stay tuned\n. So, like a JavaScript REPL with console output ? That could be done!\n. ping @marktopper -- just to remind myself\n. I'm closing this issue and moving it to another repository; https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-development. I just updated the OS.js demo server. Could you please try again and see if you still get this ? (You should clear browser cache first)\n. Thank you for reporting! :)\n. We are currently discussing the ability to stream applications somehow in the chat: https://gitter.im/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2\nIt might be possible to port WinJS applications (or maybe somehow support them). I will have to look into that!\n. Since this was more of a question I will close it for now. I will probably make a issue for general app streaming support etc\n. You land on http://osjsv2.0o.no/ , right ?\nI have never seen this error before... What browser are you using ?\nYou might want to try again. Maybe the server was overloaded (I have a lot of traffic right now)\n. That is really strange. Right now I am on the same browser and OS!\nMaybe it is a browser plugin misbehaving or something ? That's my guess at least. I will leave this issue open anyway\n. @joecracko @mgmoody42 @flinn2112 @warranlin @brianNnelson @dexterlabora @davidthewatson \nCould you try to clear your browser cache and retry the demo and see if you stil get this error message ? I might have found a fix for it, but not sure since I'm not able to replicate :)\n. This has been solved in a recent commit. Turns out it was due to the touch input handler which is being worked on as we speak! :)\n. For now, I've simply added a workaround for this (not showing error dialog on exception for this spesific case), because it is a vendor issue.\nNB Demo server has not been updated yet, but will be by next week\n. Duplicate of #185\nI am trying to figure out why some people get this. I suspect a browser plugin. Please look in that issue for more information and debugging\n. Thanks for reporting in! :)\nThere's still a lot of improvements coming to mobile platforms: [Core] Touch, Mobile UI and small-screen improvements #112\nNote to self: This is gui-color-box event triggering\n. Never even crossed my mind! Thanks :)\n. Duplicate of #190\nThanks for reporting it! I have made a possible fix for this and I will deploy it later today :)\n. This should be fixed in https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-expermiments/commit/6fa05fc9d6ef7052721b4aaebc730aad2d4195a4\nDemo server will be updated midnight CET\n. I'm pretty sure I have solved this problem.\nI will update the demo server around midnight CET (probably).\nThanks for reporting! :)\n. This seems to be the exact same problem as #185 -- I am looking into this!\n. Thanks you for reporting! :)\nI will look into this\n. I am closing this issue in favour of #40 -- any updates will be made there :)\n. Yes, you can use OS.js as your primary desktop environment on top of X11 or Wayland.\nSo far only streaming GTK3 applications is provided, but I am looking into ways to be able to stream anything cross-platform.\nSo it is currently a bit limited to what applications you can use and such, but this is something that will improve over time!\n. Hi! Thanks for showing an interest in OS.js :)\nThe translation files might be missing a few items here and there. 'en_EN' has everything, so you might want to compare the files :)\nI don't know if you are aware, but applications have their own files as well:\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/wiki/Join-the-translation-team\n. Thanks for reporting in! :)\nThis is a duplicate of #190\n. Thanks for reporting!\nIt seems that this is a problem for some users and I have yet to find out why. It still works after you close the error, right ?\nDuplicate of: #185\n. Good. Then at least nothing breaks. What browser and OS do you use ? And do you have any plugins/extensions running ? \nTrying to gather some information on this to help be debug\n. You right-clicked the \"start menu\" or just pressed it normally ?\n. Oh, you're using a touch-screen maybe ? I will make a note of it in #112\nI have at least added a prevention for this error. Thanks for reporting! :)\n. Thanks! This should be fixed now :)\n. Nice catch!\n. :+1: @neacsugeorge \n. Thanks for reporting! :)\nI am not able to replicate this bug. You just:\n- Opened \"Draw\"\n- Made something\n- Used \"Save\" from the menu\n- Wrote a filename and confirmed\nand then error showed up ?\n. I'm pretty sure this got fixed in the recent update -- if not I will re-open.\n. Could you try to explain what steps you made to get this error ? \nSomeone else reported this error, and I thought I fixed it :(\n. No problem about your English (I am not a native speaker myself).\nSo this might have something to do with the demo server because I have extremely high traffic at the moment. \nBut I will keep watching out for this. I am pretty sure this a bug even though I cannot replicate it myself.\nThanks for reporting! :)\n. Is this related to #203 ?\n. I'm pretty sure this got fixed in the recent update -- if not I will re-open.\n. Thanks for reporting!\nDuplicate of #185\n. Thanks for reporting!\nDuplicate of #185\n. Nice!\n. Much appreciated! :)\n. > I clicked on text nmcx what is underscored in my FF 46 browser. Lang pl_PL\nWhat do you mean by \"I clicked on text nmcx what is underscored\" ? :)\n. I'm pretty sure this got fixed in the recent update -- if not I will re-open.\n. This might be because your browser has cached the contents of the previous release. You most likely have to clear your cache and reload.\nI was unable to replicate this. Please try again and report back if it is still there :)\n. And I just checked Firefox. It seems that it always detects english as your language. I have no control over fixing that :(\n. I added prevention of this in https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/commit/aae65a5831656bad01829d119916f493ad5c33cc -- but you still said you got it. So I think you're still getting the cached site.\nMaybe you're getting a error in another location in the code now ?! Would be interesting to see the entire error message after I have changed the code.\n. Thanks. This should be more than enough to help me get to the root of this :)\n. Applied another prevention for this. Still unable to recreate no matter what browser and platform ... grr. Can you clear cache and try again ? :)\n. This seems to be a Firefox Nightly spesific bug -- no wonder I was not able to replicate, I only use stable builds! Downloaded the Nightly, and boom! Added a fix for it\n. Thanks for helping out with the debug :+1: \n. Thanks for reporting! :)\nThis is a duplicate of  #203 and will be looked into ASAP\n. Hi naltun,\nThe Google Mail app needs some work -- it has been far too long since I've looked at it as my priorities lies elsewhere at the moment :(\nI will definately look into this when I have resolved all the other issues that has come in.\n\nIs there any particular way to document the issues?\n\nI think the information you provided should be enough for me to replicate and debug this.\n. I'm closing this issue because it belongs to https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-extras and I'm going to retire the v2 applications pretty soon.\nFor the upcoming v3 release, I'm going to work on https://github.com/os-js/osjs-gmail-application (which is private at the moment) that will resolve all these issues.\nAny further developments will be in the repository linked above. I'll make a notification here when it goes up.. Thanks for reporting!\nThis is a duplicate of #185 and will be looked into ASAP :)\nIt works after you close the error, right ?\n. I've had several people test the demo site for me, and so far nobody has been able to replicate it.\nI am starting to suspect it might have to do with the Google Analytics that is loaded on the page and it is some kind of connection or network/region issue. I would love to know if this happens if you deploy your own version on the local network and run it on the same device.\nI will have to dig further!\n. So far touch-support only extends to the Core and GUI. Some applications (like Tetris) has not been updated for this (hence why it is in the experimental repository).\nSince this is related to a separate repository, I will close this issue.\nI've made sure to make a note of it in the official touch-compabilty issue #112 . Thanks for reporting! :)\n. Thanks! :) Fixed\n. This update should take care of that problem.\nThanks for reporting! :)\n. But I don't understand what your idea is. Is there some screenshot you forgot to attach or something ?\n. I am currently working on making a scalable icon set (imported from gnome), so this is something that is in progress :)\n. The problem is that you only currently have 8 pixels of \"usable resize space\" before the icons become stretched or shrinked. A scalable icon theme is required to make it optimal.\n. I made a note of this in #49 and will re-open this issue when I start working on this functionality, Stay tuned and thanks for the suggestion :)\n. Nice catch! There's probably more of them ;)\n. Thanks! I just updated all the source files, so this is perfect :)\n. Thank you very much! :)\nCan you also take care of the Application translations ?\n. You can look here for instructions on that: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/wiki/Join-the-translation-team#application-instructions\n. :+1: \n. and a happy new year! :)\n. @yasintoy Well, what would you like to do ? :)\n. You can also check for any missing strings and fill in those (See if there are still english words)\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. Strange. Is this on a local setup ?\n. Aha. Windows -- we meet again!\n. I cannot replicate this. It would be interesting to see why this occurs. Do you know how to use the debugger tools ?\n\nIt would be interesting to see what the respnse from server was that lists the files.\n. Right you are! Looking into it!\n. Should be fixed now\n. Aha. I know why. Thanks for reporting! :)\n. Yeah. This is the only solution that works good.\nThe problem is that the Writer app uses an iframe to sandbox it's contents. And events inside the iframe does not bubble out to OS.js without writing some glue code (which I have, but proved unreliable).\nI will look more into making a \"proper\" fix for this so you don't have to click another time, as you said\n. Oh, yeah. There are some inconsistensies between dialogs and windows in some cases. Thanks for reminding me! I should probably go through all apps and make sure it gives focus back properly (this is automatic, but I probably forgot to send a reference to the \"previous window\" in the dialog api call)\n. Yeah, that's how it basically works, but it expects you to send a reference to the window from which dialog was created -- I must have forgotten to add these in some cases (most likely after I refactored the UI system back in the day).\n. I just checked... and, yes, I have not applied the parentObj parameter to the calls.\nSo nice of you to report all of this, and to actually take the time to descover even the tinyest of things my brain simply does not catch! :+1: \n. FileManager should have this fixed now. I will go through the other apps as well.\n. And I think have the rest of the default provided packages sorted out :)\n. Oh, I will make it so the document gets focus after a dialog close\n. Should work properly now\n. Damn, man. You're bringing in a lot of reports and stuff. I like that :)\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. This seems to occur because of a timeout or connectivity issue on my demo server.\n. Nice! :)\nI only have one comment and that is the indentation in the code. Make sure you use two whitespaces (not tabs) in the code. If you look here you will see that some of it is mis-aligned quite a bit: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/pull/231/files\n. Maybe you should change it to \"tooltip\" as well. I think some might mistake \"title\" for the label that displays time and the \"time format string\" as something else entirely.\n. Much appreciated! :)\n. Hey :)\nI managed to delete my last message... ops! It seems that your codebase is outdated and I cannot merge your patch. Please update your repo and try again.\n. > This branch has conflicts that must be resolved\nI have to merge this manually -- hold on\n. Oh, I see the problem here. Your repo was actually over 2 days old when you made that commit.\nSomeone else actually translated what you did after that:\n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/commit/cc3adbe18719738a42362de797c620b90a932cfd\n- https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/commit/467bbf899b3fb07b5737873264fbf68333db9ca7\nSo, sadly I have to close this request.\n.

There's a lot of incoming updates for mobile UI and other scaled browsers, so it will all be done in the forementioned issue.\nI will make a comment in this issue when this issue has been completely resolved :)\n.

This is also related to #112\n. > As your OS.js runs inside a normal Browser, I would suggest to introduce an \"companion app\" for Windows 10. This enables the users to test it and get the look&feel of linux-OSes in general.\nNot sure I understand what you mean by \"companion app\" still.\n\nIf the user likes the OS, he can simply use this app also to download the most recent image of this OS or at least the setup: http://os.js.org/installer.exe\n\nBut, you are still booting into windows... making it something else entirely. \nNow, OS.js comes with a X11 launcher so you can use it as a full-blown operating system (running on top of Debian), but that involves installing a Linux distribution on to your computer.\n\nIs this server strong enough to accept more users?\n\nYes.\n\nIf you would like, I can design/implement the Windows Universal App and publish it, too.\n\nI provide a NW.js build which is a native executable. Is this sort of what you mean ?\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pj5zpim0mw62dci/win64.zip?dl=0\n\nAs I would use an embedded Browser, I can also add some \"custom\" APIs to Javascript, which you could use to stay in touch with the users.\n\nThis is pretty much not doable if you run in a browser becasue of CORS. The only way to make a browser would be to have a proxy running in the background, or use something like NW.\n. But I don't understand why :) Isn't it easier to just link to a site where OS.js runs with a specialized application with a tutorial or something that simply has links to the download page and such ?\n\nJavascript-API: My Idea about API is that you can inform the user when a new version is available or when something happened. Like an newsfeed.\n\nDo you mean like a notification in OS.js (after you installed it) that tells you an update is avalable ?\nIf so, that could be useful. Not to sure about the same thing for newsfeed -- It could be an optional thing, sure, but not on by default. I'd be pissed off if I suddenly got notifications about news I did not really care about :p \n\nIf you are interested, I can give more details in a few days. Including Concept-Art etc.\n\nSure!\n. ... I still don't understand what you mean. And by \"APIs\" are you talking about WinJS ?\nTo me it seems that the NW build is what you're looking for. It is a standalone version of OS.js that runs without a browser in a self-contained executable.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, I'm from Germany so my English is probably not the best :smile:\n\nWell, I'm from Norway -- so probably not the best here either.\n. > OSjsAppRuntimeEngine.ReadFile(filename)\nYou can do this in OS.js natively with NW\n\nOSjsAppRuntimeEngine.StartUpload(filename, targetUrl, callbackEventHandler)\n\nAlso this.\n\nOSjsAppRuntimeEngine.QueryAllUserPictures() \n\nYou can also do this by using a filter to scandir() VFS API.\nAs for the screenshots it looks like you want a NW build with a custom splash screen.\n. > > OSjsAppRuntimeEngine.ReadFile(filename)\n\n\nYou can do this in OS.js natively with NW\n\n\nCorrection: You can do this in OS.js natively\nI forgot to erase a part of a sentence :P\n. >  You can't read the local user files on my disk!\nYes, you can with the NW build. \n. The NW build is not running in your browser, only on top of webkit. Just like a normal \"windows window\" or whatever\n. > It this you final word? \nWhat do you mean by that ?\n\nWell, it's your decision.\n\nMy decision to what now ? \n. > To me it seems that the NW build is what you're looking for.\n\nAs for the screenshots it looks like you want a NW build with a custom splash screen.\n\nIt just means that you have everything you need in place to make a \"companion application\"; with the description you gave.\n. > Of course, I have everything to do it. It would also not be very hard.\nYou can make a NW build by using the provided Grunt task: https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/doc/NW.md and go from there.\n\nI want to make it so, that people can use it simple and that a lot of people can use it.\n\nAnd that'd be good, but I'm not sure if OS.js has enough \"stuff\" to make a good impression in this use-case. It'd be sweet to have better networking, media integration and proper office applications and that.\nIt'd be sweed to have it on appstores and such as a sort of demo to see \"what is possible\", but not to sure if it is ready for it :/\n. This year will bring many goodies to OS.js. Some really awesome stuff in the works and upcoming collaborations :)\n. > A Browser would be realy cool.\nThis will only be available in standalone (NW and X11 builds). But is something coming down the road\n\nSee, this means development is stil happening.\n\nWell, yeah. I don't intend to stop... and have not since the very first build.\n\nAnd if you increase your audience, probably more people will donate money or help you with bug reports, suggestions, patches, pull requests etc.\n\nThat goes without saying. But still, feedback/visitor rate is extremely low, and usually is in open-source projects. Sometimes you get really lucky (like I've been) and gotten some good connections and buisiness projects out of it.\n\nHaving good marketing (social media, blogs writing about this app, ...) we can increase the audience to a new level.\n\nOS.js is all over social media. It kind of \"blew up\" this december. Blog post is not much of interest since updates are mostly technical, but I am going to produce a lot of videos about the development side of things.\n. Yep, as @NoNameProvided said, it runs on OSX as well (it is not in the Grunt config by default, but can easily be added -- NOT TESTED!).\n. NW simply exposes the Node APIs to the client so you have full access to the underlying platform. No need for custom layers. \n\nsince the nw version of os.js was most likely design for crossplatform it will not include native api calls\n\nThere's no need to include anything. Node provides everything you need. (If I am not mistaking you here)\n\nso there is indeed TONS of advantages of implementing real osx code, including memory consumption and thread optimization.\n\nJavaScript in its current state is single-threaded. NW runs on libwebkit, so it is a memory hog!\n. I'm doing a \"spring cleaning\" of the issues right now and wondering about the state of this ? Seing it is kind of unrelated to this project repository, I'm thinking about closing it for the time being.\n. Allright. Just notify me when you get around to uploading it to a repository or something :)\nClosing this issue for now\n. I'm wondering how the Microsoft Store actually works and how people will be able to locate this app there. I don-t have any experience, but I've heard vey worrying things :/\n. But how will people that dont know about OS.js find it without hearing about it? Will it appear in a feed at random, or is it just searchable? How good is the search, and how much control do you have over metadata ?\n. > Of course the app will not appear as the top-most one in the store\nNo, that much I figured.\nI'm just wondering how people would normally find it. If it works like the Play Store and those it might be a bit hard if you're not spesifically looking for it :)\nBut yeah, there's nothing to lose. I'm just curious\n. @TRoskop Nope. Maybe I can use the MS provided browser VM test images. https://dev.windows.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/windows/\n. @TRoskop Good old email is probably easiest, or just a dropbox link. Gitter has private chatting\n. @khoaakt These applications are not a part of this repository, hence should not be created here. You can use this issue if you like, or put up your own repository and link it here.\n. :+1: \n. @TRoskop It'd be nice if you could upload the sources to your Github profile, so that the \"os-js\" organization could fork it and have it featured in the feed(s) :)\n. Nice :)\nhttps://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/wiki/Hall-of-Fame\n:+1: \n. Maybe this should trigger some sort of easter egg? ;)\nAny ideas ?\n. Some sort of \"black hole\" effect could work only using CSS. If the window was to \"shatter\" or something like that some kind of third party lib is required to make an \"image\" of a DOMElement and then manipulate it with <canvas> or something\n. Just for now I added a little animation that sort of resembles a black hole sucking the calculator into it. I'll have some more fun with this later, but for now I am closing this :)\n. Yeah, this is something I definately should do. It just needs some proper planning!\nThanks for reminding me!\n. https://github.com/os-js :)\nI really want to transfer all repositories over here, including renaming \"OS.js-v2\" to \"OS.js\", but it will break a lot of stuff... so I am scared :/\n. Also, the homepage will break since it is a part of github pages. I will have to plan this carefully.\nIt seems Github at least redirects all traffic from old name/repo--so that is a relief.\n. I just tested transfer of ownership + renaming and it worked just fine phew.\nI just have to ensure that the homepage domain transfers smoothly.\nGitter should take care of this as well so the community does not get lost: https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter/issues/153\n. I have transfered all the package repositories and renamed them as well. It seems to work just fine :)\n. It has now all been transfered successfully.\nThanks to @indus for incredible response time and support!\n. Duplicate of #216\n. This was already solved as part of another update. Demo server is just out of date :)\n. :+1:\n. I think this was added by mistake. It was never used it seems. Thanks!\n. Hi Fillipe :)\nThank you for the kind words! It's nice to get feedback on the code and architecture (as very few has done this).\nIt seems that you have some conflicts in the pull-request, so I cannot merge it. Is your repository up-to-date ?\n. mocha is not a requirement. It is just for running the server-side tests (I'm not sure I understood you correctly)\n. It runs just fine on master branch.\nIf you take a close look at this pull-request, something is not right.\nIt says 20 files changed (including removals that should not be there). Some file permissions also seem to have changed.\nMocha installation is unrelated. Look at this:\n\n\n\nError: Cannot find module '/home/travis/build/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/src/server/node/node_modules/osjs/osjs.js'\n\n\n\nMocha fails because it cannot find this file. Your pull request removed it!\n. :+1:\ndisregard last message\n. You got the message \"File exceeded: something\" and then this error, right ?\n. Thanks for reporting!\nTo increase the max upload size  do, ex:\n```\nSet limit to ~200MB\ngrunt config:set:client.VFS.MaxUploadSize:209715200\ngrunt config\nMake sure to restart server\n```\n. Related to #267 :)\n. But what about the build scripts ? Those were changed as well, yes ? Can you include them ? :)\n. Really nice!\nThank you very much :)\n. Duplicate of #185\n. Duplicate of #216\n. > Hi, I know that you have in mind, amongst many other things, the addition of a word processor.\nOh, yes. This has been actually bothering me for quite a while. It's impossible to find a solution that integrates easily... most of the projects out there are not actual word processors, but small rich-text editors.\n\nI got the broadwayd server daemon running in an Ubuntu 15.04 VM. Things like gedit work fine, except for the fact that if a user closes the app in the web browser, it closes it on the server, too.\n\nThis is because you're streaming the applications. All interactions happens on the target computer :)\n\nI had a go at building LibreOffice to run in a web browser, but it's a bit of a monster and not easy for a novice. My build failed in the middle of the night when it found an EOF before an EOL. Perhaps my VM ran out of memory?\n\nIf you are planning on compiling LibreOffice, you need a shitload of RAM, hehe.\nIt seems that LibreOffice uses broadway just like OS.js to stream the app, so no need to build a custom one. Just use the binary.\nhttps://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Using_LibreOffice_in_a_Web_Browser\n\nYou can find the Collabora Online Development Edition (CODE) at:\n\nI-ve looked at other alternatives as well. The thing about these online office suits is that they don't have an actual API and integration modules -- they come as one big and ready package. So there is no easy way to make use of it without just running it in an iframe or something like that, which kind of defeats the purpose.\n\nI'm sure you have this covered already, but one thing that I noticed about gedit (for example) is that open and save gave access to the /home/ directory of the Linux user running broadwayd \u2013 though fortunately access was denied due to a lack of permissions \u2013 whereas we'd of course want to be able to open and save to the OS.js user's home.\n\nI will look into this\n\nThe thing is, I'd like to provide a OS.js native application (not broadway or stuff like that), but not been able to find any library for it. If you come across one, please let me know!\n. Interesting. It does not seem to support that many features, but it's something worth investegating. Thanks :)\n. @corbinu Looks like a solid web framework there. Will have to investegate closer this weekend. Thanks! :)\n. THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN MOVED TO http://community.os.js.org/\n. Duplicate of #216\n. Duplicate of  #185\n. Duplicate of #185\n. PR #286 introduced some minor movment of locales in certain files.\nCan you make sure your fork is up-to-date ? I cannot automatically merge it if it is not\n. You might have to resolve some conflicts to make it work for you -- you know how ?\nFollow these instructions on how to keep your fork up to date (in case you don-t know) https://robots.thoughtbot.com/keeping-a-github-fork-updated\n:)\n. Oh... I should have checked closer :P\nCurrently on the train on my way home from work and looked over quickly -- it looked OK.\nThen I will close this :)\n. So you speak Italian and French ?\nWell deserved spot: https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/wiki/Hall-of-Fame\n. Now I'm confused. Which parts did you do ?\n. Then @Kirkhammetz won't get a spot in Github contributors... Oh well..\nAt least he got mentioned here https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/wiki/Hall-of-Fame\nThanks @Kirkhammetz !\n. @Kirkhammetz There is definately more coming up! I have you on my list now :)\n. Crap. I just now noticed that the Italian translations were never merged here Oo\n. @Kirkhammetz Is it possible for you to make a new pull-request with these translations ? They were'nt merged after all -- something went very wrong here! :P \nThen you'll be included in the contribution list after all!\nThere's been some additions to the locales, so look out for that!\n. @Kirkhammetz Awesome! :)\nThen I will close this one\n. I can't believe this has not been caught earlier. Nice! :+1: \n. > Added french fr_fr translation and reorder language by alphabetical order for simpler organization.\nNot a bad idea :)\nThanks @eraffaelli \n\nI think it's good to reorder the list of languages like this. When I translated, so confused was where I should insert my language into the list.\n\n@drzix Generally it does not matter :)\n. Nice catch, man! :) Thanks!\n. Much appreciated! :)\n. Awesome! I will forward this to the other translators in #18 tomorrow!\n:+1: \n. :)\n. This PR actually had a syntax error that was not detected by my services!\nPlease test your changes before submitting :)\n. 1f23c14023ec4784b6c05867e35c02cab4f70c5b\n. It'd be nice, but that example looks very gnarly! Maybe a programatic approach is nicer ? Ex:\n'LBL_APPLES': function(arg1) {\n  if ( arg1 <= 0 ) {\n    return 'There are no apples';\n  } else if ( arg1 === 1 ) {\n    return 'There is one apple';\n  }\n  return 'There are {0} apples';\n}\nvar label = _('LBL_APPLES', count);\n. The example was generic, it fits in all usecases.\n. #304 superseeds this\n. :)\n. Huh ? Me ?\n. Ah :)\n. This was fixed in 1f23c14023ec4784b6c05867e35c02cab4f70c5b. You probably just need to update your repo.\nLet me know if that worked\n. Great! :)\n. Really nice! I added a comment for you to read :)\n. > I think it's so complicated for new translators in the future to translate what to do and where to do.\nNot really (I cannot make everything \"beginner safe\"). And even if it is; I would not worry too much -- this is easily fixable by writing a bit more in-depth translation tutorials.\n. Looks good to me! Merging :)\n. - https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/wiki/Style-guide\n- https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-and-submitting-changes\n. You also have some other style issues:\n- 2 spaces (not tabs)\n- Aways spaces when using parentheses\n. Also:\n- Always use single-quotes!\n. You can see it in defail in the build log: https://travis-ci.org/os-js/OS.js/builds/104646538\n. It does not look like OwnCloud has any Client APIs. All I could find is documentation on their REST API that has a supported PHP library.\nDo you know anything about this ?\n. Then this might be of use https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/webdavjs at least for the node backend\n. jsDAV seems to be a server library. I can't find anything about client abstractions in their wiki, nor examples.\nEx:\n- https://github.com/mikedeboer/jsDAV/wiki/Getting-Started\n- https://github.com/mikedeboer/jsDAV/wiki/curl\nEven though webdavjs has not been updated in 7 years, at least the RFC's have not changed either, hehe. Maybe the code-style is a bit outdated, but I will give it a go\n. > https://github.com/sara-nl/js-webdav-client\nThis was the first I looked at. This library expects you to run your own dav server on the same host. So it won't work in cases where you host your files remotely.\n\nhttps://github.com/perry-mitchell/webdav-fs\n\nThis looks kind of over-engineered for its purpose. I think I like webdavjs' simplicity better. After all, all it really is, is a XHR wrapper that does REST calls.\nhttps://github.com/aslakhellesoy/webdavjs/blob/master/src/webdav.js\nIt also has a lot nicer code (imo) and seems way more friendly to changes.\n. \nIt seems I don't even have to add any third party libraries. Works like a charm using OS.js internal XHR tools :)\n. I now have the beginnings of a WebDAV VFS module for OS.js :)\n. It is now possible to mount WebDAV (Tested with OwnCloud):\nOSjs.VFS.createMountpoint({\n  name: 'ownCloud',\n  type: 'webdav',\n  description: 'WebDAV Test',\n  options: {\n    host: 'http://10.0.0.89/remote.php/webdav/',\n    ns: 'DAV:',\n    username: 'anders',\n    password: 'abc123'\n  }\n});\nNext step is to make a dialog for actually doing this via GUI.\n. Ref: #304\n. @piranna I'll have a look :)\n. A connection dialog is soon complete (#304) so you don`t have to do it via console :P\n. Closing this issue because it will be separated into https://github.com/os-js/osjs-webdav-vfs when v3 comes along.. This is easily done via http://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/create-handler.html. I'd have to set up a domain and test it locally. Since I have a lot of other stuff on my plate, it might take a while to get around to.\n. I'm not to sure about the future of the PHP backend, but it would be nice to have the same functionality anyway. I know from experience that PHPs LDAP internals are more than good enough for authentication.\nIf you find the time, then, please, go ahead :)\n. I'm closing this issue because it will be separated out into another repository.\nI've set up https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/osjs-ldap-auth (but is private until I have it fully wokring). This is the \"correct\" way to do it.\n. ~~Preferably, you'd want to create a custom file, and not modify the inluded ones. Ex, src/conf/900-mystuff.json~~\n{\n  \"stylesheets\": [\n    \"src/client/stylesheets/mycustom.css\"\n  ]\n}\nEdit Ignore me\n. hmm. Come to think of it, ignore my previous comment! You cannot add items to the list like that.\n. Run grunt dist-files afterward to update 'dist-dev'.\nIf you use 'dist', run grunt core\n. the 900-custom.json file appears whenever you do grunt config:set:something:orother. \n\nThe login page for instance i would need to add a 'Companyname' field as that is how my authentication backend is made.\n\nYou want to create a custom dist distribution. Copy src/templates/dist/default and rename it to your liking. Then grunt config:set:dist.template:mynewname. You can now customize the login screen without modifying the provided files.\nThe interaction with the login form all happens in a handler. So you probably want to make your own and override the initLoginScreen method.\n. grunt dist-files rebuilds your dist directory to the forementioned template you made\n. Nice catch! Investegating\n. A missing return false statement Oo. \n. Ok. I'll just duplicate what happens in upload function (it has overwrite)\n. This is pretty much a goal for the beta :)\nJust gotta find time for it. It would involve:\n- Refactor the [node and php] HTTP request handling a bit to look up method from URL\n- Refactor the [node and php] VFS modules\n- Refactor the [client] VFS wrapper\n- Refactor the [client] VFS modules and helpers\n- Update unit tests (which is very handy in this situation for server)\n. I'll have this in the back of my head for a while to see how it developes. I already have a pretty clear picture over how this should be done, but would like it to mature a bit more :)\n. I'm going to start on this now, in a separate branch.\n. @RickGlimmer New branch https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/tree/new-api-uris now has this pretty much done. Just gotta do a lot of testing (probably some bugs left) and refactor the PHP code as well :)\n. I think this is pretty much done now! :D \nSo now all api functions have respective URIs: /API/function and /FS/function\n. > You are fast! :)\nWhen I first get started, it sort of consumes me :)\nCurrently doing some other improvements for clarity purposes and consistency.\n\nI screwed up my local copy and restoring from origin i seem to miss the file settings.js. And i can't seem to find it and a grunt does not create one. Any idea?\n\nSomeone else had this problem on Windows as well... hmm. Try removing dist and dist-dev then do grunt checkout -- dist dist-dev recreate symklinks and run grunt\n. grunt config. Syntax error in one of your src/conf files ?\n. oh. goddamn windows! Fixing now\n. There\n. I know.I forgot about the windows spesific path workaround that did not take that into account\n. nitenite :)\n. Superseeded by #304\n. Update for this is coming later today. There are some other changes coming relating to this coming :)\n. Hm. I've been working on the VFS today, and now I'm not sure what you're talking about.\nMy Handler::onVFSRequest() is triggering on all modules. It's the main wrapper for all VFS calls\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/f24f5aa8bd3ac7aadc71d259c55469130c980e98/src/client/javascript/vfs.js#L200\n. > I see you moved some files. It is now in internal.js\nI just made some changed to properly name and split some sections. Functionality has not changed :)\n\nit is the following part. All others ('write','exists' etc) use OSjs.VFS.internalCall and use the loaded handler. This one has its own Ajax part that it uses.\n\nThat's because I use a XHR request that returns ArrayBuffer. This is best done with the browser API and not channel through the backend.\nI can make it possible to customize this as well. Just have to think it out first.\n. This was added to the branch https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/tree/new-api-uris.\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/new-api-uris/src/client/javascript/handler.js#L341\nYou can now hook into them all:\n- _callNW() for NW builds\n- _callAPI() normal API and VFS calls\n- _callXHR() this is the function you want to modify\n. I might change the name from XHR to GET or something like that instead\n. Ok. So now the handler has these:\n- _callNW() For NW.js builds\n- _callAPI() For API and VFS calls\n- _callGET() For VFS file reads/downloads\n- _callPOST() For VFS [browser] file uploads\nThat should cover everything :)\n. - __callXHR() Setup for all general browser API/VFS calls\n- __callGET() Setup for reads/downloads\n- __callPOST() Setup for browser file uploads\n- _callAPI() Wrapper API calls\n- _callVFS() Wrapper VFS calls\n. Superseeded by #304\n. @RickGlimmer This issue now superseeds #302 and #303.\n. FYI: I am merging this into master as we speak :)\n. @RickGlimmer Thoughts on the changes ? :)\n. The \"problem\" is that the data is made with the browser APIs and comes with full data uri. Relevant: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/data_URIs\nI don't want to perform any string-type operations on this in the client (effectively doubles the needed ram usage).\nThe server assumes that write comes with base64 unless the raw options flag is set (binary).\n. @RickGlimmer This problem can somewhat be \"solved\" another way. Instead of relying on write function on the server, it is possible to simply use the browser upload functinality. That way the transport is always arraybuffer.\nIt's something I'm considering.\nBut as you said, this made it a bit easier to work with, and avoid confusions with nested JSON to the APIs. Also debugging is a bit better in the browser now since it makes a distinct entry in the network monitor (no more \"API\" only. It actually shows the method used)\n. > I am not a fan of datauris because once they start to get bigger they slow down things considerably and they can be easily abused. \nNot a fan either, but\n\nOne of the requirements is that no GET's are allowed, only POST.\n, the request for the .js and .css files do not go through the handler.\n\nGET is used for resource loading, how are you supposed to get around this ?  Oo\n\nWondering if it would be better if xhr is changed into get.\n\nYeah, I realised this a bit to late. It should be changed, for sure.\n. > as i need to keep user data absolutely separated\nSo you're doing permission based VFS ?\n. > The current frontend is a older style website in need of modernization. :)\nNot sure what you mean by this\n. It sounds like you're doing permission based VFS, yes. I started working on group-based permissions yesterday, and plan to finish it today. Tokens is probably something I'll look into later (for all requests. This can be done for GET requests by hooking into the transport path() function and append the token to the URL).\n. Yeah. That's how I imagined it :)\n. User Installed applications is something that is not finished yet, so I'll add that as a task above :)\n. Remember, OS.js is designed to run on the Node server. I already maintain a working PHP server, which is a pain. If someone wants to run it on anything else (like you did) it is pretty much outside the \"official support zone\" or whatever you'd call it.\n\nFor people who want to run this on a windows server this is pretty important. It can be solved but it is not something most people know. And if it can be avoided, the better.\n\nThe best way to solve it is to simply change the vfs-path to a escaped query parameter\n\nFor people who want to run this on a windows server this is pretty important. It can be solved but it is not something most people know. And if it can be avoided, the better.\n\nAnother thing... if someone is already customizing it to run on ISS, I'd imagine they have enough knowledge to figure out how to make it work ... right !?\n\nHope I'm not coming through as negative. It's just that I'm basically completelty alone when it comes to development of this project, and I have to put a line somewhere as what I can do about all this at the moment (but of course you can modify whatever you want to make it work in your usecase) :P \n. I just did a google search on the error and the first link had the solution. Hehe.\n\nMy request is if the \":\" can be dropped or maybe changed into a character that is allowed. You would then have no future questions why it is not running on IIS. :)\n\nWould it work if I used:\n/FS/get/?path={urlencodedpath}\n?\nThat is the simplest solution\n. But you did not answer my question :p \n\nI saw that this particular case is a bit more difficult as it is used for the src attribute of a script tag that is added to the page.\n\nThis is what I meant by \"resources\" earlier. Images, scripts and stylesheets all do this.\n\nAn alternative that will work is if you add script like this:\n\nThis is really not an option at the moment (I think). With the Node and PHP server you can pass resources through your scripts -- so this is not an issue there.\n. Can't you do that in ISS ? Like proxy/redirect all requests through your server code ? (mod_rewrite)\n. > An alternative, and maybe even easier would be to allow the handler to modify the url.\nI will plug this in... It's an obviously better choice actually :)\n. Allright, mr @RickGlimmer . Handler now has ::getVFSPath() :)\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/src/client/javascript/handler.js#L296\n. Let me know if that name sucks... it was the first that came to mind (naming is hard)\n. Also changed FS:xhr to FS:get\n. This all made it into the Arduino branch! Total win, because next update will have all these updates\n. @khoaakt I'll look into that, but the current desktop icon view was designed to work as shortcuts.\nI can maybe provide both solutions and have it in Settings\n. Closing this issue. The remaining stuff will get its own issues when I get started\n. Nice!\nI think some new translations was added after you cloned the repository. Can you take a look ? (I know it was about ZIP and some VFS stuff)\n. I'm guessing this is something that happened after an async event and something was detached.\n. :+1: \n. This only added client-side. See: 4f01b12a0a6fa0436079fb58216e8488d71847b9\n\nThe object that ends up in the handler is\n\nEnds up where. Which method ?\n. Allright. It should now be consistent in the callAPI method! :)\n. I just added a couple of new entries as well ;)\n. Really nice! I like your enthusiasm :)\n. Hmm. There is something wrong with my style check task.. some things does not get caught :/\nCan you please change it to this ?\n```\n      if ( newTop <= current.rectWorkspace.top && newTop !== null ) {\n         newTop = current.rectWorkspace.top;\n         newHeight -= current.rectWorkspace.top - mousePosition.y;\n       }\n```\nOther then that, really nice work!\n. You forgot to push ? :)\nGood night!\n. You're still missing a space before closing your if statement\n```\n      if ( newTop <= current.rectWorkspace.top && newTop !== null ) {  // <- HERE\n         newTop = current.rectWorkspace.top;\n         newHeight -= current.rectWorkspace.top - mousePosition.y;\n       }\n``\n. Nice :) Now, get to bed! hehe.\n. Can you just make bcrypt required? Also squash your commits ?\n. You don't actually check if it is NaN :)\n. All I am saying is that, you wrote you check for NaN, which meansisNaN(number)` ;)\nThis works too of course\n. Could you apply the same to PHP ? :)\n. This seems to be a bug with Ace editor (which is a third-party editor).\nProbably fixed in a later version. The demo server is running an outdated version :)\n. No need for PASSWORD_CONFIG. Just assume the user wants this :)\n. Did you build OS.js correctly ?\n. @joaofraga Do you know how to use the Network Monitor and Console in the browser ? I'm very interested in finding out why this happens\n. I am aware of this and know the reason. I will fix this today\n. Should be resolved now. Thanks for reporting in!\n. It's much better to fix the problem then to simply remove it ;) hehe\ncdab68fce0e51121fb2b0f72367a64ff3dd5d329\n. BTW: The problem was that I had forgotten to add a check for the Control Key. CTRL+O and CTRL+S are shortcuts for these apps\n. Duplicate of #185\n. Do you use AdBlock or somthing similar?\n405 errors come from Google and not OS.js\n. OK. I will investegate this\n. This is the same problem, only slightly different error message.\nIt seems it fails to load oauth via google for you. It works just fine for my accounts -- i will have to dig deeper\n. Aha. That explains it pretty well!\nThank you for looking into it and reporting back with such detail!\nI will add a notification that triggers on errors like this, so the user know what's going on (or at least one of the reasons).\nI don't think there is a way around this from my side (except for proxying, which I cannot do on my demo server for bandwidth and security reasons)\n. I could look into adding server-side oauth's yeah. I'll add it to my list of things :)\n. Hi,\nThis is a very late reply, but I'm closing this issue because I'm going to retire OS.js v2 pretty soon. Any issues relating to the Google APIs and their applications will be split into separate issues. I'll make a notification here when these come up.. How did you trigger this ? I've never heard or selectlikeaboss... what is it ?\n. > Triggered just once (seems cannot repeat more) in audioplayer when tried to scroll/rewind some song. \nOkay. This issue has been noted. There's a single-fire bug on the timeline scroll thing\n. Duplicate of #324\n. This application has not been updated to use the latest APIs, hence why the loading stays.\nWill be fixed in another repo: https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-store/tree/master/packages\n. This should be resolved now\n. @junland OS.js uses GTK (Gnome) icon themes, hence the directory structure and the name of the icons. There's a plethora of icon packs, hence why I chose it.\nCurrently all icons used are PNG, but SVG is coming soon.\n\nare not used put them in a \"extended\" icon folder \n\nSomething like this would be nice. I could make icon themes have a \"parent\" attribute, so that it builds it like you described when running the grunt [theme] command(s).\n\nTo get a list of all icons used, use this: https://gist.github.com/andersevenrud/793aa46063652afbc6eadb4dfa848d5f\nThis is the current list: https://gist.github.com/andersevenrud/46ab915c79238f42d59da31bd725c115\n. @junland Updated the script and list so the output is sorted -- may be a bit easier on the eyes.\n. @junland You can now do this in your theme metadata file to use a parent.\n{\n  \"name\": \"mytheme\",\n  \"title\": \"My Icon Theme\",\n  \"parent\": \"default\"\n}\nAlso, you can now run grunt themes:icons to build icon packs.\n. @junland If you find the time to make a material (or font awesome) icon pack, then please, go ahead.\nThere's a project that is reminiscent of googles design, but fits better on desktop: https://snwh.org/paper/icons\n. @vlotho You can now edit the labels of your launcher shortcuts for the iconview.\n. @msaqibansari No, but I can add this now\n. @msaqibansari I just commited a new feature so you can hook into it:\nOSjs.Core.getWindowManager()._on('wm:contextmenu', function(ev, wm) {\n  API.createMenu([\n  ], ev);\n  return false; // Make sure original menu does not show\n});\n. @msaqibansari But if you want to modify core files the file and method you just mentioned is the correct one\n. @msaqibansari You need to create a 'Handler'. There are some included\nhttps://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-multiuser.html\n. CoreWM Desktop IconView can now load files and shortcuts etc from the actual filesystem! :)\nNot 100% finished, but will be merged into master this week after I have polished everything.\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/tree/new-corewm-iconview\n. @khoaakt @msaqibansari The dekstop IconView now actually uses the VFS :)\n. Closing this issue for now. The remaining tasks will get their own issue when I get started on it.\n. @samuk Hard to say, really. \nSince this is primarily a desktop platform, that is what I will focus on. But I got mobile support on my radar, and have made the groundwork for this (base touch handling, media queries and dynamic content, orientation detection etc.), but the Window Manager itself is missing functionality and does not have a UI optimized for smaller screens.\nI'm working on this alone, so I'm kind of jumping back and forth between my TODOs... but this is a general prioritized roadmap I have (which I keep in my notes) that might give you an idea when you'll see more work on this:\n\nNew backend and build system update (done, not merged yet)\nBetter VFS Transports (done, not merged yet)\nBetter documentation (almost done, not deployed, preview available)\nBetter test integration (in progress)\nMore work on GUI Elements and their APIs\nStart work on system module integration (hardware abstraction etc. )\nSmall screen optimization for CoreWM\nAdd viewport support to CoreWM to show only one \"app\" at a time. @samuk \n\n\nSo maybe 6-12 months? \n\nI think that range would be a fair estimate. Why both ? bcryptjs is an alternative to bcrypt\n. Could you maybe squash the commits ? :)\n. Next time, maybe think about your commit messages a bit more :)\nSomething like: \"Fixed typo in mysql handler doc\" or \"Updated npm instructions in mysql handler doc\"\n. The Calculator is going to be reworked. It's kind of crap at the moment :)\n. This should now be fixed! :)\nNB: Demo server has not been updated, so don't expect it to work there\n. Thanks!\nI will update this ASAP\n. The user information should now be correct.\nIf you get 404 on API functions you probably do not have \"mod_rewrite\" enabled. Check that first -- since I have no problems on my end atm.\n. Also make sure you have \"allow override\" in your vhost so Apache can read .htaccess\n. > After the above said modification of handler.php, it shows \"demo\" instead of \"undefined\", without taking into account the given mysql user\nThen the server is not running with the correct handler. I`m not having any problems with this locally and https://osjsv2.0o.no/ is running on Apache.\nDid you change the handler according to the docs ? https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/doc/mysql-handler.md\n. Just realized I had some typos in those docs -- fixed.\nBut, anyway. I just set up a fresh VM with PHP5 and Apache and used the docs to set up the mysql handler. I`m having no problems here :\\\n. Yeah. I remembered I forgot something that leads to the \"undefined\" problem, but that was only for demo handler, the mysql one has been updated by another user in the community and tested.\nSo the server is obviously using the wrong handler somehow -- a dead giveaway is that it says \"demo\" as username.\nSorry, but I cannot be of more assist at the moment -- I have to go to bed.\n. > [TypeError: Cannot read property 'homes' of undefined] 'TypeError: Cannot read property \\'homes\\' of undefined\\n\nIt seems that it has some trouble reading the settings file. So my guess is there's something wrong with yours.\nWhat do you get when doing grunt config:get ?\n. Or more spesifically grunt config:get:server\n. I'm thinking that your src/conf/900-custom.json file might be broken (which is the one generated when doing config via grunt) -- because I see no way of this happening on a clean setup.\n. Your file is broken\n\n\"server\": \"handlers\",\n\nThis was probablyu because of the typo I had, as which I corrected :( Sorry about that!\nYou should have something like.\n```\n{\n  \"handler\": \"mysql\",\n  \"server\": {\n    \"handlers\": {\n      \"mysql\": {\n        \"host\": \"localhost\",\n        \"user\": \"osjs\",\n        \"password\": \"osjs\",\n        \"database\": \"osjs\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n. > Please note that I've already performed the new config setup as suggested in the just-modified mysql-handler.md (together with a git pull).\nThat would not help if the 900 file has the error in it :)\n. You cannot install these applications into your home directory. The \"extras\" repository is for system installation.\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js-extras/blob/master/Terminal/README.md\nhttp://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-package-manager.html\n. Oh. This is the demo site!\nSorry -- I will fix this. These packages do not belong there. Someone tried to install it -- but that will not work on that server :)\n. Great! :)\n. @ht68 also got this. I will investegate this\n. I am not able to reproduce this. Are you on Windows ?\n. I'll have to set up a Windows Virtual Machine and find a workaround for this. I know what the problem is, but not exactly why (weird that it is platform spesific)\n. note-to-self: https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql#pooling-connections\n. OK. Thanks for the information. I don't think I have time to solve this today, but I will definately do it by tomorrow.\n. Sorry for not getting back to you guys, I've been extremely busy.\nI have a possible solution for this in the works and will commit tomorrow\n. Allright boys! I've updated the codebase with a possible fix. Could you test it ? :)\n. @aminmazi Then it sounds like a broken configuration file. Could you please give me the contents of your src/conf/900-custom.json file? \nThis happened in #335 as well. To summarize: I made a mistake in the documentation, leading to misconfigured file (the 900-custom file is generated when you do grunt:config:set).\nSo the easiest way to fix this problem is to remove that file and re-do the configuration steps.\n. @ht68 Can you test this as well ? :)\n. @aminmazi \n1) The login will return error message if the mysql service is not started/runninig or operating properly. I have just tested this.\nIf you get the \"logged in as demo\" problem, the client config is broken (which I explained) and it uses the wrong handler. Which probably means your src/conf/900-custom.json is messed up.\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/335#issuecomment-183521506\n2) Fixed in 4ee6db9d622f5ae25221d7228be227ac3404a244\n. @anmonteiro I just realized something..... If you are using dist and getting \"logged in as demo\" even when running the mysql handler, then maybe you forgot to run grunt core to update the client properly. If you encounter this problem again, please let me know.\nBut nice that you got it working at least :)\n. Great! :)\n. > This comment ({username : admin , password : admin}) because the password to hash form of expression, users noticed a username and password to log in to be.\nI don't understand this.\nAnyway, I will have to wait to merge this until the php server does the same encryption. @Bouhnosaure  was looking at that :)\n. @aminmazi @ht68 \nOh, I understand what you mean by the comments there now. My brain was obviously not working that day :)\nThe best solution for this would probably be to include a script to set up users in the mysql handler.\nSo you can do ex: ./bin/mysql-handler-config add <username> <password>  instead of inserting it manually to the database.\n. Full list of possible examples:\n./bin/mysql-handler-config add <username> <password> <group1>[,<group2>] \n./bin/mysql-handler-config password <username> <new password> \n./bin/mysql-handler-config groups <username> <group1>[,<group2>] \n. I've updated the PHP handler in 38ead2499985974b7477cdcfbaca54c685503e0d, so this can be merged. \nOnly one problem @ht68 -- your commit message does not actually explain the changed. Can you please change it to Updated mysql handler documentation or something ?\n. I fixed the commit message for you in 862f5aa09e1f7fbd0ce340382d011d525445f04d .\nNext time, please make sure to write more informative and \"direct\" logs. If you're not sure, then just ask me :)\n. Sorry, this code fails to meet the style guides.\nIf you run grunt jscs jslint you'll see what's going on.\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. You can also see the errors here: https://travis-ci.org/os-js/OS.js/builds/109793966\n. I made an alternate solution that ensures all values are \"correct\" https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/commit/4ee6db9d622f5ae25221d7228be227ac3404a244#diff-5295af79e44baedef8104665503116efR226\n. Could you please change your commit message to \"Added missing dependency to PAM documentation\" or something like that ?\n. Correction: Could you please change your commit message to \"Added missing dependency to X11 documentation\" or something like that ?\n. I fixed the commit message for you in 1331fcbdc028caf13b953ff41a44dbdfe80631e8.\nIt would be very nice if you could fix #342, so that can be merged too ASAP. \n. This commit message is relevant in \"os.js.org\" repo, but not in here :)\nSomething like:\n```\nUpdated INSTALL\nRenamed \"NIX\" to \"*NIX\"\n```\n. I fixed this in 3096481b6883ff6045ec533b08aa1e05ba895a21\n. Could you please squash your commits so there's not three duplicate messages in the log ? :)\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-and-submitting-changes\n. Also, there's more translations to do in the applications if you're up for that :)\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/wiki/Join-the-translation-team#application-instructions\n. This was merged manually in 32a9e9966893a9534e6ac10e1c72f9563fece9c8\n. > ReferenceError: $ is not defined\nAre you trying to use jQuery ? :)\n. <application-window data-id=\"SampleAppWindow\">\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./resources/materialize.min.css\">\n  <script src=\"./resources/materialize.min.js\"></script>\n  <a class=\"waves-effect waves-light btn\">Stuff</a> \n</application-window>\nThis is a bit redundant. You already load them from metadata.json file :)\n. > I guess so, I think jQuery is embedded into .js file\nJust took a peek in the docs, and it says: \"One last thing to note is that you have to import jQuery before importing materialize.js!\", so you have to add that too to your meta :)\n\nis there a conflict with having jquery like that or is there a conflict with how I loaded the materialize files?\n\nYou won't get any conflicts here. OS.js has no dependencies to begin with in the client, so you can mix and mash however you want.\n. Derp!\nI just now realized that you cannot include third-party stuff via manifest in iframe applications. They are completely isolated, and anything you \"preload\" is loaded into the OS.js \"side\"....\nI've updated the tutorials now... so it mentiones this briefly: http://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/iframe-application.html\n. :+1: \n. I'm making a CLI tool to set/modify the mysql handler users. It will be added today when I get back from work :)\n. Also, GUI utilities for stuff like this is something in the works as well. (Not only user management, but lots of system tools)\n. You can now do:\n```\nnode bin/mysql-user.js pwd \n```\n. > Error: Cannot find module 'mysql'\nSeems like you don't have the required modules installed ;)\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/doc/mysql-handler.md\n. Are you using the PHP server ?\n. Then you-re using the PHP server. That explains why you get \"cannot find module\" -- you never installed them, as they are not required for the PHP server to run, but is for Node (and the CLI tool)\n. > I don't understand what you mean.\nYou're using Apache, which means you are using the PHP OS.js Server.\n\nI had already installed mysql and bcryptjs modules\n\nMaybe you installed them in the wrong directory ? You would not have noticed, because the PHP server does not care about these at all.\n\nInstall them in the root directory of OS.js installation: npm install mysql bcryptjs and try using the utility again\n. bin/mysql-user.js is a utility written in node, so it requires the npm modules to run. So my guess is that you did not install them correctly the first time around :)\n. > Tried again the installation , but same results.\nAnd the module is not here /path/to/osjs/node_modules/mysql ?\n. Aha! Remove the  node-mysql one and try install again.  I think the package has changed name over time and it is a \"collision\" or something.\n. > I think the package has changed name over time and it is a \"collision\" or something.\nEither that, or the dependency was changed.\nYou're absolutely sure youre installing from /path/to/osjs right, and not some subfolder ?\n. Good to hear! :)\n. This whole thing is going to be reworked. Not sure about the design though ... gotta give it a think,\n. Any changes will be noted in #329 :)\n. \nI've embiggened the size of the entries... so at least that helps; a bit :)\n. Something like that is the plan for this :)\n. On devices <=800px the menu now goes \"full screen\" and has scroll when all entries does not fit :)\nAlso, on these devices Windows are always fullscreen and the panel has a \"minimized\" version applied to it.\nI've started making the Scaled UI stuff, so this was the first step :)\n. Nice :)\n. Duplicate of #185\n. Looks good to me! :) The failing test is because of an utdated package referenced in package.json (I will fix that myself)\nCould you please squash your commits to something like \"Added it_IT locales\" or something ?\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-and-submitting-changes\n. I can squash it myself, just checking if you know how :)\n. I just tried it for myself, and it's not that easy since one of your commits are made in the past and conflicts occur while doing a git rebase.\nI think the best option here is to make a backup of your translations, reset your repo, then copy changed files back and do a new commit and PR.\nThe npm-debug.log should not be in the commit btw :)\n. Allright :)\n. Just wondering about the status here. Not in a hurry or anything, just like to keep myself updated :)\n. > Yea I know sorry, I've been really busy at work, I'm going to take sometimes tonight to do it or it'll take forever!\nDon't feel sorry, man. It's not like you even had to do this, but I really appreciate that you did :)\n. I can't solve this without any information on how to reprodue it\n. Could you provide reproduction description ? :)\n. I'm closing this now because I have no way to replicate this.\nFeel free to re-open this again if you have some more feedback about this issue\n. @muka OS.js actually has its own build system that simply consists of concatenation and [optional] \"uglification\". It's pretty solid.\nThis issue was more aimed at the CLI, not the actual build process, but appreciate the input :)\n. Seems that the plugin developers finally stepped ut their game. I managed to initiate an update process on some of the repos, so now all the critical ones have been solved! :D \nI've thought about this for a while, and I think I will simply change the syntax of some of the operations to make this all prettier. I don't want to manage anymore build-related code -- there's already way too much stuff in place.\nInstead of:\ngrunt create-package:foo/Bar:extension\nrather:\ngrunt create-package:foo/Bar --template=extension\n```\u00a8\n. Hi muka,\nThanks for the kind words!\nYou might be interested in https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-system\nI'm also working on integrations like this (only not DBUS at the moment).\n\nwould like to suggest (as feature request) to extend the current Settings application in order to allow pluggable components (eg network, bluetooth, printers) a-la control panel\n\nYes. This is basically the plan for the future Settings application. It should behave more like a control-panel as you said.\nIf you want to take a stab at it, then I don't mind at all :)\n. To use the system packjages you need to install the wireless-tools npm package.. I think I have not noted that anywhere. Just FYI install it in the os.js folder with  npm install wireless-tools\n. Hey!\nTry running grunt dist-files apache-htaccess to see if that fixes it.\nSome files were removed from the dist/ dirs by default, and needs to be generated.\n. I just updated https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/doc/server-php.md#apache . Thanks!\nThe dist-files task is a part of the default build process, so new users will not suffer from this problem. And just running grunt after updating your source is something you should do :)\nI'm in the process of making a FAQ on http://community.os.js.org/ , where I will also announce any changes and updated in the coming future. I will also set up mailing lists there, so if you want to get a message when stuff like this happends, make sure to register! :)\n. Travis can be kind of an asshole sometimes ;)\nI'll merge this when I get back home.\n. And it is done! Thank you very much for taking time to do this :)\n. Did you have any problems ?\n. Thanks! :)\n. This means that you don't have the dependencies install properly. Terminal should be a gobal object\n. Don't be sorry, man :)\n. This comes from the Strophe library which is maintained by someone else. I'm pretty sure that it has been fixed it's just that I'm running an old version. Will update!\n. The webserver probably had some problems serving you the file in that instance -- seems to happen once in a while. It could simply have been a connection issue. Thanks for reporting though! :)\n. Should be fixed now (but demo server has not been updated). Thanks :)\n. It seems that you have an outdated codebase. Do a git pull in both the OS.js install and the \"developer\" packages repo (or download latest zips), then run grunt\nRef: in https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/commit/bb71a3bd372a0d1ca654a0f65fd871e0dd5cb05a \nAlso, is that Firefox ? Because it does not work there, just FYI.\n. Mindori should work fine since it uses Webkit :)\nThis change occured March 23, so it's kind of weird that you should have this problem if it was downloaded yesterday. You downloaded from Github, right ?\n. There is no technical differences between the linux automated installer and when you do it manually, actually. So that is very strange.\nBut you don't have the problem anymore, right ?\n. Sorry, but I do not understand what you wrote there.\nWas it a \"no\" ?\n. If you still have this error, then your codebase is simply not up-to-date. This change was made earlier this week and the IDE was updated at the same time.\nI am not able to replicate this on my own computer(s), so the problem must be on your end. I actually just tried to set up a clean VM, run the installer (and manually) to test this -- and dit not have any problems at all.\n. If you update your codebase again this issue should be resolved :)\n. Was this on the demo server ?\n. If this was on your local setup, make sure you follow the instructions properly\nTo me it looks like either:\n1. You have not built everything correct\n2. Had a temporary connection issue\n. Closing due to inactivity\n. Thanks :)\n. Just update your codebase :)\n. This should be fixed in https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-games/commit/695fd310ee0af905886223eda9404fa389655985\nDemo-server will be updated this weekend.\nThanks!\n. Thanks!\nConfirmed -- looking into it :)\n. Allright mr. @pringles49. This issue has been resolved :)\n. This was an uncaught bug (false-positive error) after a refactor I did recently. Oops!\nThanks! :)\n. I've made some progress on this today. Made a filesystem model that fits into localStorage and started wirting a mountpoint (transport module) for VFS.\nI can probably look into compression for this to be able to maximize storage space. Chrome only supports 5M per domain. For text this is no problem, but once you start adding images it will fill up quickly.\nThis gave me a chance to implement a \"free space checker\" as well to mountpoints (if they have that functionality enabled), to prevent writing to a full disk/location.\n. Didn't get much time to continue on this today, but I've successfully implemented scandir and read and write, so not long until this is done :)\n. @davidpaulrosser I took some time to go over this again today and made some improvements. While doing this I nailed a couple of things in place as well. I've added a TODO in the description of this issue :)\n. @davidpaulrosser I had some more time to look into this, and it is pretty much complete. I just have to do some extensive testing, finishing a last few minor things  :)\n. Looks like I am only 2 bugs away from completion on this one :)\n. I will close this issue now since it has been implemented. @davidpaulrosser Feel free to comment here still; if you have any issues.\nFor anyone else reading this: if you want to use this yourself, contact me and I will put it up on gist or github.\n. This is not a bug, but simply:\n1. Some translations are not up-to-date with source/applications\n2. Some applications (like settings) have not correct labels set\nIf you want to get a list of missing \"keys\", do this in your browser console:\nObject.keys(OSjs.Locales.en_EN).filter(function(v) {\n  return typeof OSjs.Locales.fr_FR[v] === 'undefined';\n});\nSo yes, these are missing translations :)\nIf you want to look into it, please go ahead.\n. Ref: #18\n. FYI, if your plan was to make a pull-request or something, please read this before you start commiting and pushing changes: https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n:)\n.

Disregard my last comment (if you got it) -- I simply looked at the wrong thing! My mistake :)\nJust a comment: You've made 5 commits -- really it should be one. This is mentioned in the contribution documentation.\nI can squash the commits, but then you have to reset your repository to be able to get future updates.\n. Don't reset until I have merged this though. Or else these changes are lost!\n.

Cool!\nI see you've already squashed your commits and doing some other changes -- would you mind changing your commit message to:\n\nLocale: Updated nl_NL (Dutch) translations\n\n? :)\n. There might be some missing translations in the apps as well (Like Settings). So if you want to you can have a look there too :)\n. Thanks!\n. Nice!\n. You only got this once, or do you know how to replicate it ? Because \"some old stuff\" does not mean much to me :)\nTo me it seems like the editor tried to select a element that does not exist. Do you know which one you selected ?\n. I'm still not quite sure what you mean by this.\nYou deleted the application physically ?  Then clicked what ?\n. Ok. So, you:\n1. Made an application with IDE\n2. Deleted said application\n3. Restarted and tried to start it\n4. Got error message ?\nDeleting an application will make an error, because it was not \"uninstalled\"\n. NOTE TO SELF: Add VFS listener on the home://.packages path to regenerate the index\n. This should be solved now\n. Really cool! This is something I actually wanted to do, but never found any time :)\nYou can use the ListView here to list all your active downloads.\nKeep me updated on this!\n. Since this is not a project relating to this repository; I'm going to close this issue.\nYou can of course resume conversations here, but it will remain closed. I'd suggest opening a thread on http://community.os.js.org/ so we can have an open discussion about it on a forum suited for it :)\n. Do you have a screenshot ? \n. Ah. I see what is going on here. On you keyboard layout you have to press the SHIFT+TILDE key to get this symbol, which was actually the keyboard shortcut for the Window Switcher (like ALT+TAB in windows).\nI have moved the shortcut to ALT+TILDE instead, since this does not produce any characters :) I also fixed so that the icons in the windowswitcher do not strech, like seen in your screenshot.\nAlso updated the demo server, but it is cached, so you might have to clear your browser.\nThanks :)\nRef: 6320266fbc4b8a1a5a74eaaf063a2698c5404b8d\n. Either:\n1. You are running in production mode and have not built packages\n2. There was a problem in transfering the file, which is normal. Just retry\n3. The file is physically missing\n. I'm closing this issue, because there are no problems with this currently.\nFeel free to reopen if you're still having issues\n. Could you please change the commit message to server-php: Updated exception handling in handler template, or something like that ?\n. Also, your repository is from 30 Dec 2015, which is very, very old. Please update it to upstream, or I will be unable to merge your requests\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/\n. Your commit still has the same message (pull-request title does not matter in this case).\nAlso, your branch has two merges that I cannot accept into my branch.\nIf you don't know how to rebase and squash (including changing the message), I'd advice making a backup of your changes, reset your fork completely and import the backup, then re-commit changes with the correct message.\n\nI set up a couple of rules a while back regarding this, so I don't make a mess of the commit-history of this project (which leads to all sorts of trouble).\nMore information: https://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-development.html\n. No problem, mate! :)\n. I realized I forgot to update the manual I linked -- I just fixed this (it was a broken link and missing text)\n. (The old stuff is probably cached for a few minutes, so refresh a couple of times to get the updated manual)\n. Need any help to get going ? :) Just asking because I did not get any new notifications\n. @davelab6 There is also user-installable applications (via zip files). It is not very visible in the client yet, because I am currently working on (with some other people) the \"store\" features. When this is done you can simply drag-and-drop or search for apps to install!\n. To me, most of these sandstorm apps looks like kind of Iframe stuff. But I am on my way to bed... have to investegate more tomorrow! Thanks! \n. Well, everything will be stored securely on my server, and any submission will go through a validation and approval process. At least if they are submitted into the official repositories.\n. Also, zip-files is only one of the methods to install applications.I just used it as an example -- anything would work,\n. Well, this is the whole purpose behind the \"store\" and the validation/approval process though -- if you manually install something with malware on it, then it's not much I can do about it -- right ?\n. I will have to get back to you tomorrow. It's pretty late here and I have not had any time to really look into what you're suggesting\n. @davelab6 I've been looking a bit more into this and starting to understand how it all works. It's very interesting, for sure!\nBut at this time I sadly do not have any time to look more into it. I am completely swamped with work.\nI will look into it later though. Thanks for bringing it to my attention :)\nClosing the issue, but made a note in my [private] issue tracker.\n. I'll reopen the issue when I have some time. I'll probably have a few questions ;)\n. @davelab6 Yeah, it'd be great to be able to spend all my time working on free software. I actually have a couple of things going in my spare-time related to OS.js that pays off, and if it continues at a steady rate, I will seriously consider doing something like that :) The thing is; I do this alone, and PR is not exactly my thing... I should probaby look for someone to help me with these kinds of things.\nThanks!\n. @davelab6 I already have that, but only as a badge. I should make up some text :)\n. I thought I fixed this some time ago.... maybe it's on my work laptop that I use when commuting, and it never got commited. Will have to check! Thanks :)\n. This should no longer be a problem :)\n. I've also made some general improvements to the resize handler :)\n. I'm pretty sure this error is because your browser does not support 3D accelerated rendering, which this application uses.\nI'll make it so the error is a bit nicer\n. This seems to be a vendor and/or OS problem: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/4927\nI have at least added a proper error dialog/message when this occurs: https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-experimental/commit/9e30fdf8942c86e53a1ca63a301f08e48b59274d\n. #304\n. This is planned\n.  #329\n. This wiil be added at some point\n. Yeah, this is a good idea. I'll look into it :)\n. All progress on this will be commited into https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/compare/search-engine\n. @vlotho Thanks for initiating this :)\nI am closing this issue now and any maintainance or unfinished stuff will be in #304.\n. This should be posted in https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-system.\nBut mdadm is de-facto standard for managing volumes in Linux, so this is what would have to be used in some form.\nIt's just a matter of making shellscripts that wraps the commands and execute it via the node server. \nBut yeah, this is probably something that comes down the line.\n. There's not much one can do about this,  because it heavly depends on your hardware, OS, drivers and browser vendor.\nThere might be a few tricks in CSS that could be applied to improve this, and could be benchmarked.\nAnother solution would be to have an option to disable live repaint of windows. So that you move/resize a transparent box instead of the  actual window (overlay) and it refreshes the window when you let go of the mouse button.\n. One could also look into actually optimizing the code that handles these events. Maybe something has been overlooked.\n. Can you send me the Scheme file ? I'd be interested in running some profiling on it\n. Allright! :)\n. You have to install it via another repository. You can find it under the\norganization page for OS.js on github, or the documentation.\nDen fredag 6. mai 2016 skrev XtremePlayzCODE notifications@github.com\nf\u00f8lgende:\n\nWhen you install osjs, theres no ace, any explination?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/388\n\n\nAnders F. Evenrud\nSoftware Developer\nBlog: http://tinyurl.com/cjfrfx8\n. Instructions are linked from all repositories. Just see link in README\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js-extras\n. This is not a problem with OS.js itself, but with the chat server it is running on.\nI will look more into this, but i guess it is just because of my demo server. It might be outdated or have some problems now and then because of heavy traffic.\n. Hello. \n\nI was thinking of making a Desktop Environment out of this project \n\nWell, that is what OS.js is :) To quote the tagline:\n\nOS.js is a JavaScript web desktop implementation for your browser with a fully-fledged window manager, Application APIs, GUI toolkits and filesystem abstraction.\n\nOr am I musunderstanding something here ?\n. You can already do that using NW.js, which is supported :)\nYou can get test builds from https://builds.os.js.org/nw/ , but these are a bit outdated.\n. You can make it run natively by basically using any form of libwebkit solution (or a <webview>).\nI hope this answers your question; and that I understood you correctly\n. Can you see what version you are running ?\nOSjs.API.getConfig('Version')  in the javascript console\n. I was thinking in your browser console, but I see the version number in the screenshot. Thanks\n. Relevant: #392\n. This seems to be an asynchronous issue when window has become detached. I have a solution for this which I will make this weekend\n. I've made a fix for this issue, and it will be submitted to the Arduino Team ASAP\n. This is related to #391\n. Search Engine is not complete in anyway, so expect bugs. Also it has its own issue already which you made #385\n. I moved your documentation up to the setup section and modified the commit message.\nMerged! Thanks :)\n. Should be fixed in https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-development/commit/d62041939ecb47e5af0fbc4d0f279bce89b29aa4\n. @sergiotomasello Could you get one of the guys to make an ipk of https://github.com/Lua-cURL/Lua-cURLv3 ? :)\nI am having some trouble with luarocks for some unknown reason... can`t get it to work.\n. It seems that 53d539a4dd06175c98da2271a136698e65227d64 solves the problem, accompanied with this ipk.\n@nichis I will submit this to the Arduino Team ASAP\n. A note for anyone that wants to hotfix this:\nEdit /usr/lib/lua/osjs.lua. On line 39 and 40, change require \"curl\" to require \"cURL\"\nThen:\n```\nTIAN BOARDS\nwget https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/files/265823/luacurl3_0.3.4-1-1505_ar71xx.ipk.zip\nunzip luacurl3_0.3.4-1-1505_ar71xx.ipk.zip\nopkg install luacurl3_0.3.4-1-1505_ar71xx.ipk\n``\n. This is most likely because you were using thesearch-enginebranch and switched over tomaster` or something.\nIt is complaining about the missing Search section.\n. https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/commit/ac0c163272c8023b468887340fb53e61daabf274 Should prevent this error from happening\n. Can happen for many reasons. Most likely:\n- You changed the code files or configuration and did not restart server\n- Transportation error (network failure)\n- Browser failed to load resource (network failure or corrupt/invalid cache)\n. Check your network log. Seems like it failed to load the scheme file\n\nat Object.Utils.ajax.onerror\n. See browser network log for more info\n. I'd advice against using any ad-related extensions together with OS.js.\nERR_VFSMODULE_FIND_FMT\n\nI just added a locale for this.\nDid you look at the browser network log ? It should give you an error message\n. \nin the browser developer tools\n. The server reported a 500 error, so it should be in there. Find the scheme.html file that was loaded for Settings and look at the response\n. Click on it and inspect the response\n. That means you restarted the server and not your client. You lost your session because of this\n. I am unable to reproduce this.\nThe server crashes ?\n. See the network log on what happes when it does the find (XHR) request\n. I think you might be missing the library used by find function. npm install\n. Looks like the same error to me.\n\nUIScheme::load() packages/default/Settings/scheme.html\nUtils::ajax() Object\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)\n. I am unable to reproduce this error, even with the mysql handler.\n\nMake sure to:\n- Use the correct branch search-engine\n- Do a git pull to ensure you have latest code\n- Run npm install to update dependencies\n- Run grunt to rebuild OS.js and all configuration files\n- Restart your server\n- Restart your client\n. You also need to add the mimes to the base system config (see src/conf/130-mime.json) to to make OS.js regognize them :)\n(Run grunt config afterwards)\n. And now you have one! :)\n. Nice! :)\nThere was also some new additions in previous commits:\n- https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/commit/5c9313b664b4feefcae23df1410c78948d4755d0#diff-5\n- https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/commit/3ec23a908b32abb19c176cc06efba9cbf7e33270#diff-1\nCould you handle those as well ? :)\n. I have to squash these commits and that will make your master branch go out of sync.\nYou should make changes in a custom branch to avoid this :) \n. This is actually intentional. I will make it stick to the panel bottom instead of the button you clicked\n. It now sticks to the panel/screen :)\n. Thanks! This was due to the recent panel rewrite and me forgetting a classname :D\n. I am unable to replicate this.\nFYI: Latest version is 2.0.3. You should do an opkg update and opkg upgrade arduinoos\n. Please update and see if that helps out. If not re-open this issue\n. OK :) No problem\n. Nice catch!\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_blink\n. Thanks :)\n. I'm not 100% sure what you mean here.\nIs this a caching problem in the browser (as we spoke about in Gitter), or something else.\n\nHowever, if 900-custom.json is changed to the following (removed src/ from core_custom.css line):\n\nThis would fail, beacuse the path is invalid.\n. I'll try this locally\n. Your file is stored how exactly (path relative to OS.js) ?\n. Do a pull, then set the file back to src/client/dprm/themes/core_custom.css and run\ngrunt core dist-files\n. Solved in 1a90bb7ca8228a9c468b8c0dffabc024866c0780\nSure thing!\n. Thanks for reporting!\nThis is fixed in master now, but the demo server is updated on a schedule (this week)\n. If you're using git, just do git pull and run grunt\n. You did not follow instructions completetely. You're missing a dependency named 'Strophe'\n. Make sure to follow: https://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-package-manager.html\nThen look at https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-extras/blob/master/Chat/README.md\n. Duplicate of #417\n. Duplicate of #417\n. Unable to reproduce :/\nMaybe you have some plugins/extensions that prevents the files from loading properly\n. Duplicate of #417\n. I'm pretty sure you did not build the packages after you installed them and that's why you get this error.\nIf not see the console output from server\n. Seems to be an issue with the Strophe library. I'll investegate\n. I can't seem to replicate this error :/ There's been some updates to the dependencies recently, so it might have fixed the issue.\nIf you still have this issue or can show me how to trigger this behaviour, please re-open this issue.\n. You can disable this behaviour by setting moveOnResize to false (CoreWM setting) :)\n. Oh, but they do not follow the size of the browser. Is that something you'd want ?\n. Thanks! :)\n. Hi!\nThis is something I really want to have implemented down the line. I'll see if I can't set up a branch and do some initial testing on this.\nI've actually gotten quite a few questions/requests on this topic, so it might not be a bad idea to look into it sooner, rather than later.\nGood ideas here. Thanks :)\n. I might finally get to start the ball rolling on this now, as #617 is nearing completion. All of the recent changes should make this much, much easier :smile_cat: . @alalonde Yeah, things are hard-coded to use the body, and so are certain events. So that's where it might get tricky. But it you wanna have a go, then by all means.\nI'm working on v3 which has the options available to set it to whatever you want. Hence the reason there has not been activity in this spesific issue.. This issue has been moved here: https://github.com/os-js/osjs-client/issues/39. Woh. Another bug in the LS module :) I'll fix this asap\n. https://gist.github.com/andersevenrud/09f198b9f55cbf8e434341f4388844dd\n- Now throws error when you try to move/copy to a destination that does not exist\n- mkdir() no longer overwrites existing directories if found\n. You did not provide any way for me to replicate the problem, so I will have to close this issue. I don't know what you tried or where :)\nIf you can provide this info, please do.\n. Duplicate of #418\n. Nice catch! Thanks :)\n. This has already been fixed, the demo server is just outdated.\n. This was fixed in https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-extras/commit/5ce51e9cf7a2ab1d7d378239a16b2e9b5130dab7.\nThanks for reporting :)\nPS: The demo server has not been updated. It's scheduled next weekend!\n. This is just because /awstats is a virtual directory (and restricted) on my webserver. So not a bug, actually :)\nI should make this entry invisible.\n. This should no longer be a problem as I have re-configured the server. Thanks for reporting :)\n. Hey,\nI can merge this commit, but I'd have to change the commit message. Unfortunately, you made your commit in the master branch, which means that if I do this, your master branch will become out-of-sync.\nThis means you'd have to do a reset of your repository.\nThe best solution is for you to do these changes in a custom branch and do a PR with that. It eliminates this problem entirely.\nInformation about this subject (\"contribution\"): https://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-development.html\n. Because I wanted to get all the PR's done I went ahead and merged this, but changed the commit message (and squashing).\nThis means the repo you made this commit in is out of sync, because it was done using the master branch.\nYou'll have to reset the repo to use the origin master branch.\n. Run grunt packages\n. I'm closing this issue because I assume it's not a problem anymore. The error you got is usually because of unbuilt packages, which the command I gave should resolve.\nIf you still have issues, feel free to re-open this thread :)\n. All libraries and frameworks are supported. Simply include it and use it as you normally would\n. Seems like something went wrong with a HTTP request. Did you experience this again ?\n. Just like in #437 and #439 this is a problem with preloading of files for OS.js packages. This is not a problem with OS.js itself but rather the webserver that runs on the board that fails to deliver proper responses.\nDo you get this all the time or is it intermittent ?\nI'm starting to suspect that your board might be unstable\n. It seems like the uhttpd webserver on the Arduino stops intermittently in some cases.\nGoing to check with the maintainers of that project to see if I can get som input as of why this happens.\n. I might have found a fix for this, but not entirely sure yet. Need some help for testing here :)\nSo, I modified /etc/config/uhttpd and changed:\noption max_requests '4'\n        option script_timeout '60'\n        option network_timeout '60'\n        option http_keepalive '3'\n        option tcp_keepalive '1'\nI think http_keepalive is the problem here and the docs note that it might cause bugs. Disabling it by setting to zero might also be worth trying. Just remember to restart uhttptd (or device) after changing the config file(s).\n. Just a small update on this. It seems that some of the system packages has recieved updated and might solve this issue. It seems to be working fine on my board.\n\nLog in via a shell to your Arduino\nRun opkg update\nRun opkg list-upgradable | xargs opkg upgrade\n\n. A note to anyone having trouble configuring the device:\nThere seems to be issues with some boards and its underlying webserver.\nYou can still configure your board using Luci.\nYou can access the Luci utility by visiting http://<your-board-ip>/cgi-bin/luci. @Liam1947 \n\nI have tried the Luci utility via http:///cgi-bin/luci as advised above. Again configuration of the wireless network fails and the Yun goes offline.\n\nSo if I understand you correctly: Luci is not working and/or faulty as well ? The reason I ask is because if you have trouble with ArduinoOS, you should be able to use Luci just fine as it is a completely different software.\nIf so, then there's not much I can do, because Luci was made by Arduino. Sounds like your board is crashing which can be a software and/or hardware issue... I don't know and can't support you regarding that.. @thewinner666 You have to install dependencies with npm install. If you still have issues, please open a new issue.. > I'm locking this issue because it is not related to this codebase, but rather software or hardware related on the Arduino platform.

The library in use is node-fs-extra which has the access method exposed.\n\nYou can debug the fs library yourself by adding this in the OS.js root and run it via node test.js:\nvar fs = require('node-fs-extra');\nconsole.log(fs.access);\n[Function]\n.

OS.js runs on its own server though, so not quite sure how to achieve what you want at the moment.\nYou can use a reverse-proxy in your webserver or maybe look at https://github.com/villadora/express-http-proxy for the same thing in your Express app :)\n.

You want a window from B to appear inside a Window from A ?\n. I don't know what you mean by a tab though. And now you say \"show some information\", which implies that you just want to do some sort of messaging between your applications. This is all very confusing! Can you make an illustration or something ? \n. @msaqibansari Could you try to reformulate your question or try to give me an illustration of what you're thinking ? I really like to answer you :)\n. @khoaakt That was my first thought as well, but not quite sure after the last message when he says \"show some information from another window\" :)\n.

If you remove packages from src/packages you have to manually update the manifest file.\n. grunt build:manifest\n. If the package exists in the manifest, it will try to load it. The error you see is the result of failure at that point -- so this is more or less equivalent to a \"check\".

Evenrud\nSoftware Developer\nBlog: http://tinyurl.com/cjfrfx8\n. Playback issues is not [generally] directly related to OS.js as it just uses HTTP for transport and the browser for codec support. I'll try to set up a reverse-proxy nginx on my test-rig to see if I can replicate this issue. It sounds like you're having stream problems in your webserver, which might just be a sign of missing optimizations and/or configuration(s).\nPlaylist support is coming -- in fact some other user said they'd implement it for me, but that never happened. So I'll have to get on that when I have a window of time -- With this comes playback using custom locations as well.\n. I've been testing this a bit. I'm using vanilla ubuntu server 16.10 (x86_64) with nginx  with reverse-proxy to OS.js server. So far no problems at all. I've tried playing anything from tiny files to huge files of 400M+ (both audio and videos).\nOn a completely fresh virtual machine with default settings (virtualbox) and a fresh OS.js install set up from docs.\nThis is the nginx config:\n```\nserver {\n        listen 80 default_server;\n        listen [::]:80 default_server;\n    root /var/www/html;\n    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;\n    server_name _;\n\n    client_max_body_size 512M;\n\n    location / {\n            proxy_set_header Host $host;\n            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n            proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;\n    }\n\n}\n```\nSo I'm not sure what's going on here. How is your webserver set up ?\n. So now I know two new things: You're on the PHP backend and running on an embedded solution.\nWhat are your specs ? I have quite a few boards lying around\n. > My setup is nginx with the configuration I copied from os.js install instructions.\n\n\nYou're on the PHP backend\n\n\nNever mind that. You probably used this ?\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/doc/configs/nginx-node.conf\n. Yes, disregard that. I thought you used the grunt generate command which generates config for PHP\n. I have the TIAN and R-Pi (v1 and v2) which is the closest I can get. As far as I know it runs well on these devices -- but never tested behind reverse-proxy on these devices. I'll investegate some more\n. Hey! Just wanted to let you know I've done several improvements to how the server handles files and added proper chunked responses to media streams. This should improve performance quite a bit and make seeking work for all native formats.\nJust thought I'd let you know :). Thanks! :)\n. Thanks, mate! Fixed\nLooks like a few bugs came up during latest update. I really need more testers! :D\n. On Windows you need to manually create the symlinks to run the developer dist. This is sadly something that requires manual interaction.\nRun bin/create-windows-symlinks.cmd as administrator.\n. If you update your codebase there's an entirely new settings application available ;)\n. http://community.os.js.org/t/update-version-bump-alpha80/101/1\n. Should be fixed now :)\n.

This has now been merged -- but it will not show in github, because I had do change some of the files you edited.\nThanks!\n. Hi,\nI only found out about \"DeOS\" yesterday. It seems that Razormind is using OS.js as a product in which they are selling. So I won't be a ble to help you here -- since I am in no way affiliated with this organization -- I'm only the developer of OS.js, not \"DeOS\".\nOS.js is actually alpha-software (which I have been developing in my spare-time since 2011) and has a lot of unfinished work.\nYou will have to contact Razormind (or whomever in charge) about your complaints and/or problems.\nIt seems that I also have to contact them, because they are linking directly to this Github repository evene though they've rebranded this as another product.\n\nThis was brought to my attention: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1564499.0\n. http://community.os.js.org/t/psa-os-js-is-used-in-a-possible-scam-razormind-deos/103\n. Note: They are using [barebones] osjs-alpha78 which was released on 16 Jun this year (and considered old). So they cannot have spent much time implementing features and applications.\nThis release came with quite a few bugs, so I guess they don't care much about keeping this a good end-user experience.\n. Seems like this thing is dead now... so closing the issue\n. Hi,\nThanks for reporting!\nThis seems like a problem with the demo-server, and not the application itself. http://osjsv2.0o.no demo is quite a bit outdated, and an update will most likely solve this problem since I was unable to reproduce this error in my test deployment environment :)\nI'll look into updating tomorrow (or tonight if I find the time).\n. This issue has already been fixed, but is pending an official update from Arduino.\n. Please read: https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/515\n. Please read this https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/515\n. Hi!\nThanks for reporting. I'm already aware of this issue and have a thread going here: #436.\n. How did you trigger this error ? :)\n. I think this issue might already have been resolved. Could you do an update and try again ?\n. Closing this issue due to inactivity.\nI'm have a note of this and it will be checked upon next version release.. Strange. I can't reproduce this error on my machine(s). Did a fresh clone and then:\nnpm install --production\ngrunt\n./bin/start-dist.sh\nEven stranger, is that it reports of missing files when you have in fact found them to be where they should -- also that no other packages are failing... they all build the same.\nIf CoreWM fails, then pretty much everything becomes messed up with the UI.\nDo you have any problems running the developer environment (which does not need this build process) ?\n./bin/start-dev.sh\n. > 1. During the \"grunt\" run there's a complaint about a missing module\n\n\"mocha\". I subsequently reset the VM and did \"npm install mocha\" prior to\n   the --production install. This got rid of that complaint.\n\nThis is just a warning, really.\n\n\nDuring the --production install I note that there's a warning about\n   \"prefer to use global version of coffee-script\" or words to that effect.\n\n\nThis is also just a warning. And comes from a dependency package.\n\nHowever, as you may have suspected, I have no problems when I run\nbin/start-dev.sh -- no errors when I connect, and the settings window comes\nup without barfing new windows across the browser.\n\nYep. This is because the developer build loads the code directly from source. So it does not matter if the package build failed or not.\n\nAlso should mention that this is still Centos 7.2\n\nI have tested this on a Debian and Arch box without any problems, so I'm suspecting something with Centos or your setup. By all means, give it a go. Then we can narrow it down easier.\n. You don't by any chance get any security errors in your logs on CentOS? \nI am noticing that a lot of people have downloaded and installed OS.js in the recent month, without any reports of similar problems -- so my suspect is CentOS or some of the packages it uses that OS.js is dependent upon. Still though, so weird that you get a ENOENT  in that spesific spot in the build process\n. @vincent-pli Can you try the developer branch ?. @vincent-pli Did it work out for you ?. @shorero Well... I got around to installing CentOS just to try out and I did not encounter this problem. So now I'm sitting here scratching my head and wondering how the hell this is a problem Oo\nCould you do me a favor and test the development branch ? Grunt is no longer used here, so you'll have to run node osjs build instead (then node osjs run to try out). Make sure to run npm install --production if you switch branches from an already cloned repo.. @shorero Thanks for checking it out for me. Much appreciated! :)\nThen I know at least there was something wrong in the previous iteration of the build system and that it has been fixed.\nI'm going to merge all the changes into master today, so I can finally resolve this issue :). I've merged everything into master now. So this should be resolved! :)\nLet me know if it's not!. Release docs: http://community.os.js.org/t/update-version-bump-alpha81/105. The installer script actually has the sudo command for npm install for the one dependency that requires it (grunt-cli).\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/src/installer/installer.sh\nWhat problems did you encounter, requiring to install the local dependencies as sudo ?\n. Aha! Then I suggest that you change the installer.sh file commands instead of running the installer as admin -- since this can cause permission problems.\n. Thanks, mate!\n. Arduino?\n. I already have an issue on this here: #436\nDoes rebooting the device help ? \n. Good idea! Added :)\n. It's in current master, so not any \"version\" per se, but we can call it alpha80.5 :P \n.

It's just a symptom.\nPlease see this comment on resolution: https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/436#issuecomment-271078038. I'm pretty sure you're running an old Node version.\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions. Install v4 or newer. O.x is pretty old.\nLook into using \"nvm\" or see the link i pasted.\ns\u00f8n. 8. jan. 2017 kl. 23.49 skrev mistergibson notifications@github.com:\n\nv0.10.25\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/544#issuecomment-271186033, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAJ3DPERRjC0bdPCX0_F4TL6eGlAaX-Pks5rQWf9gaJpZM4Ld0ls\n.\n.

Could you please explain what \"multiple display errors\" mean? Or maybe a screenshot? :). You have to refresh the browser to make all changes take effect.\nThere's a lot of missing translations, so there is still a lot of stuff in English still. But it works just fine (at least from my testing) :). @mai1015 What exactly is the problem. I think I need it pointed out to me in this case :)\n\nThat everything goes left-to-right\nMissing translations. I was actually told by someone in the community that left-to-right text was correct for this language.\n\nI have no idea... because I'm European :) So I guess this is not correct?. I've changed it out now.\nBut I will not update the demo server until this weekend since that \ntakes some time.\nOn 01/19/2017 08:33 PM, mai1015 wrote:\n\nYes... It is definitely not the case...

Duplicate of #542\n\nAha, I see. Yes, there seems to be an issue with the webserver on that board -- which is being investegated.. Btw, You can still use Luci (which is also installed on the board) to configure stuff.. Thank you very much, kind sir!. Hi! This bug has been fixed and is pending an official update.\n\nYou can still update your system with Luci (that is also available over your browser), or:\n\nLog in via a shell to your Arduino\nRun opkg update\nRun opkg list-upgradable | xargs opkg upgrade\n\n. The event name is select and not click.. You are correct. I'll make sure to do that :). You can now use click as well as select. They both behave the same. I don't understand the reproduction though. You assign a new event handler every time you run this function ? .clear() only removes the children of the element, it does not unbind the handlers assigned to it.. Hm. Actually, there is no clear() method on gui-menu. Theres empty().... so now I'm a bit confused.. Allright. I've added so that all children gets their events destructed on empty() now.. OK. Let me set up an app to test myself. Can you give me an example code please ? I tried implementing the code above, but not sure of the full usage.. FYI: You can bind the event to the gui-menu element. Where you can use ev.detail to figure out which element was clicked inside.. I figured it out.\n```\n// This always returns submenu!\nsub = submenu.append(sub); \nsub.on('select', function(e) {});\n// Correct would be:\nsubmenu.append(sub); \nsub.on('select', function(e) {});\n```. I'd suggest you use the Window class for all your GUI stuff. Ex:\n```\n  ApplicationmenutestWindow.prototype.init = function(wmRef, app, scheme) {\n    var root = Window.prototype.init.apply(this, arguments);\n// Load and render `scheme.html` file\nscheme.render(this, 'menutestWindow', root);\n\n// Put your GUI code here (or make a new prototype function and call it):\nfunction SelectionChanged(obj, submenu) {\n  console.error('xxx', submenu.$element.querySelector('*'));\n  submenu.empty();\n\n  var sub = GUI.Element.create('gui-menu-entry', {\n    'id': 'CreateItem',\n    'label': 'Create'\n  })\n\n  sub = submenu.append(sub);\n  sub.on('select', function(e) {\n    alert('click');\n  });\n}\n\nvar treeView = this._find('s1tree');\nvar submenucreate = this._find('SubmenuCreate');\nthis._find('Save').on('click', function(e) {\n  alert('save');\n});\n\ntreeView.add([{\n  'label': 'Test',\n  'icon': '',\n  'value': {\n    'name' : 'TEst', 'type': 1, 'properties': [{'name': 'asdf', 'group': 'Main', 'type': 'string', 'readonly': 0, 'value': 'bla'}]\n  },\n  'entries': [\n    {\n      'label': 'TEst',\n      'value': {\n        'name' : 'TEst', 'type': 1, 'properties': [{'name': 'asdf', 'group': 'Main', 'type': 'string', 'readonly': 0, 'value': 'bla'}]\n      },\n      'icon': ''\n    }\n  ]\n}]);\n\ntreeView.on('select', function(ev) {\n  if (ev && ev.detail && ev.detail.entries && ev.detail.entries.length > 0 && ev.detail.entries[0].data) {\n    var item = treeView.get('entry', ev.detail.entries[0].data);\n    SelectionChanged(item, submenucreate);\n  }\n});\n\nreturn root;\n\n};\n```\nYou might also I use the win._find()  shortcuts etc instead of using the scheme reference.. This probably means that my commits with the unbinding is not needed... so I'll change that a bit.. Nice! :). This only works with a backend that provides this functionality, i.e. the database authenticator module.\nAre you using this one?. I've made it so it does not show up if it's not available.. Thank you very much :). Run npm install --production.\nIf you upgraded your installation: https://os.js.org/manual/installation/upgrade/\n. You have to run the command from within OS:js directory. You're running a very old version of node most likely.\nnodejs officially stopped supporting these versions as of end of 2016. You have to upgrade, or use nvm.. You most likely have forgotten something in the installation procedure: https://os.js.org/manual/installation/nix/. You did not have to use the automated installer. I just pointed to the steps. But, OK.\nI see that you get a 404 error. Can you run node osjs run --loglevel=15 or see the network monitor in your browser for which file that failed ?. Which files was it ? Should be working, even on slow connections.. And if you run with node osjs run --target=dist ?. It should not display any of those files if you run with --target=dist.\nIt should say this when server has started:\n\n2017-01-24T18:28:52.316Z Using http on port 8000 in dist. Is there any way for me to view this site, or is it on your local machine?. Ok, I've looked at it. How exactly is your webserver configured ? If you use the node server you need a reverse-proxy or connect to port 8000 where it is running, not serve the /dist directory.. Do you have a VPS or just a normal \"webhotel\" ?. Ok. If your provider does not support native nodejs apps for hosting, reverse-proxies, Docker containers, or you have no root (access to modify webserver), then I'm afraid you cannot use the node server. (Using port 8000 is probably something you cannot do as your host has firewalls only allowing \"normal web\" traffic).\n\nHowever, you can use the PHP server, but it has some caveats:\nhttps://os.js.org/manual/server/php/#webhosts. OS.js is really intended to run self-hosted, but it is possible to run it on your setup, it only requires a few extra steps.. It means you have not set up symlinks. See https://os.js.org/manual/installation/windows/\nOr run in production mode node osjs run --target=dist.. Well, it does not matter much if it runs on your computer. The goal is \nto make it run on your server ;)\nYou have to move the entire OS.js installation over to your server... \njust like how you would transfer any other file. I can't tell you how to \ndo it... I don't own the server. So you'll have to figure this out yourself.\nOn 01/24/2017 11:41 PM, petrk94 wrote:\n\nok, now its running on localhost:8000 on my windows 10 computer. But \nhow I can move it to the server and let it run there?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub \nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/555#issuecomment-274962954, or \nmute the thread \nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAJ3DEgudc-hm-WbLGEKFHFiy-H0_glAks5rVn4YgaJpZM4LqiT9.\n\n\n. You probably did not generate the apache htaccess file (if that is what your host uses), or your server does not support it.  That's just my guess since I don't see where the 404 occured.\nMore info: https://os.js.org/manual/server/php/#apache. You can just generate the file and copy that by itself (dist/.htaccess). You don't have to rebuild anything.. Can you look at your error log in webserver ? Maybe something unexpected happened. Strange. You're just using a vanilla setup ?. I'll try setting up a nginx server here and do some testing using fcgi.. I can reproduce this. Thanks!\nLooking into it. This should be resolved now! :). Nice:).

This issue has been resolved (in a separate repository) and the patch will be applied on the next update.. The overflowing text should no longer be an issue.. I am 100% sure that I've implemented HTTP1.1 partials (ranged content) correctly:\n\nSo I am thinking that you were unable to seek because the slider was glitching out in some cases. I've done some improvements on that, so maybe that fixed your problem :)\n. Closing this as I'm assuming everything is working.\nFeel free to re-open if not.. This is supported by the virtual filesystem, but has not been implemented in any of the provided server modules. So \"yes\" depending on what you mean by \"adding\" :P . Before it can be added to the context, it needs to be implemented in the server modules. This is on the TODO, but not of any priority.. I'm closing this as of now, because this will be an included feature in v3.. In effect, closing.. All of this will be removed in https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/tree/upcoming/v2.1.0\nI'll make a proper writeup on this on the community pages when done (and in CHANGELOG etc as normal). Hi,\nYes, you can use OS.js just as a \"frontend\" for your application.\nThere's both server-side (PHP and Node) and client-side (Javascript) code for the applications you make in OS.js, so you can implement pretty much anything.\nIf your web configuration application has some sort of API, it should be pretty easy to set up :). What do you mean by \"include an app in php.\" exactly ?. I don't know what your \"code\" is, though. Also, not sure what you mean by:\n\nIs it possible to use the GUI of OS.js\n\nDo you mean the GUI toolkit OS.js provides (like, a \"native\" OS.js app), or do you just want to run your existing application inside a Window?\nTo break down both the methods:\n\nCreate a \"OS.js application\", using the GUI toolkits, etc. This involved adapting your existing codebase to run on OS.js. There's no single answer to \"integrate existing application X into OS.js\" because it depends entirely on how it was made. If your application is an API or a \"library\", then integration is pretty straight forward (just use the included examples when you make a new OS.js application), but if it is tightly integrated into something like Laravel or Symfony, using an iframe is probably a better choice.\nMake an \"iframe\" application. This is the simplest choice, as it does not require to write any new code. You just run your app inside a window and it will behave just like a webpage. This can even run remotely.. You can find information about contributions and donations etc here: https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md :). Please read #436 for more information on this. . This was fixed in #576.\n\nI was using the wrong URL in the manual. I've fixed this URL on the webpage. Thanks!. Hi,\nApparently my notifications are not working correctly. I just saw this issue :/\nPlease see #436 for information on how to work around issues for your device.. I can't help you if you don't provide any more information... so I'm going to assume you're trying to set OS.js up yourself -- then either of these can be the issue:\n\nYou did not clone the repository with the --decursive flag and the third party Ace module is missing.\nSomething went wrong while building.\nIt simply failed to load somehow.\n\nYou can use the browser developer tools to see if any errors was thrown. Feel free to reopen if the problem persists, but then please add a bit of text explaining what you did and how this error occured.. Hi,\nPlease see #436 for more information about issues on Arduino.. This is only an issue with the demo-server.\nThe latest version of OS.js removes these files, and the upcoming version will have a dedicated area for the server files which are totally ignored by the build system.. FYI I just released the latest version with the changes I mentioned.\nhttp://community.os.js.org/t/update-version-bump-alpha93/128. Thanks :). Hi,\nI think by default it builds Ace with support for all languages.\nThe issue here is that the editor does not update the Syntax Highlighting whenever a file is saved.. I've made it so it runs this function whenever a file is loaded or saved: https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-extras/blob/master/AceEditor/main.js#L111\nI'll see if I can't make it fully dynamic so it supports all languages at some point..

This was fixed in the v2.1.0 release, so I'm closing this PR since it's no longer compatible with the codebase. Sadly you won't get any contrib stats on the change since this patch was not involved :(.

Don't know if you've seen it yet, but I've released v2.1.0. This brings some changes to the bin/add-user script as it is now directly hooked into the currently configured Authenticator module.\nThis means that the home folder creation can live entirely inside said module.\nMaybe you could have another look at this and use the new APIs to perform the creation/deletion ?\nJust ask if you need any pointers..

Well, you want to launch ApplicationJava and not Java it seems as I look at your code.\n\nBtw, compile with --debug to get a better stacktrace.. It does not appear in OSjs.Applications before it is launched.. I cloned your repository and it launches just fine for me on master. Does this happen when you restore the user session ? In that case, maybe you renamed the app or something and it tries to launch the wrong thing ?\n\nI've found that loading the OS.js java library when the window shows is better than when the app starts\n\nIdeally you want to use require or import in your main file so it gets compiled with Webpack. This way you don't have to do another request. But not all libraries support this out of the box (AMD/requirejs/browserify).. This still does not answer the question: Is there still something wrong or has it been fixed on your side ?. No as in \"there's nothing wrong\" or \"not fixed\" ?. I cannot reproduce this problem myself, so I don't know how to help.\nI did this:\n\nmkdir src/packages/ross\ngit clone https://github.com/Ross-Software/OSjs-repository.git src/packages/ross\nnode osjs config:add --name=repositories --value=ross\nnode osjs build:manifest\nnode osjs build:package --name=ross/Java\n\nAnd then launched it via the menu. A window shows up with nothing in it.. Have you tried restarting the server and client ? Maybe something was cached ?!. I followed the exact steps from your comment, but still cannot reproduce any error.\nDo you have unchanged things that you have not commited to git or something ?!. I see from your latest commit:\n-        \"className\": \"Java\",\n +        \"className\": \"ApplicationJava\",\nThis is what fixed it.. That's why I asked about className.. Then my guess is either:\n\nWrong className was used\nWrong OSjs.Applications.* was defined\nSomething was cached\nYou did something I could not reflect from the Github repository you have\n\nEither way, glad to hear it was resolved :). If you experience something like this again, you can actually see all the registered packages in the browser console if you do this: OSjs.require('core/package-manager').getPackages() the keys in the object returned is what is looked up when you try to launch an application (The className).\nIt's the className that is used to launch an application. It's sort of the \"internal name\". So this has to be correct in both your metadata and application main file.\nIf you experience something similar, feel free to re-open this issue..

I can confirm that there is some issue there. Not sure why multiple events are fired, but I'm guessing it has something to do with how the browser handles <button> element and that I'll need to add a preventDefault or something. Thanks!. Sorry...I totally forgot about this. I've scheduled to look at this on Friday.. This should be fixed now.... finally. This was not easy to track down!\nEven worse, behaviour in Chrome has changed somewhat, so I had to solve some issues with other devices as well as the device emulator. Gah.\nIt's going into master as soon as I have this merge ready.. :shipit: . This looks like a regression from a change I've made at some point. I have a function that clamps the position, but obviously it's not working correctly.\nI'll look into it. Thanks!. I've added a patch for this in the development branch. Feel free to test it out.\nRef: adac650e3e2cf66d00f5f0b9faaca4d9446b2070. Now in master :). This is a strange one. For some ungodly reason the contextmenu event does not trigger inside of a panel element. I'll have to do a bit of digging here.... Oh, nevermind. It seems that the event somehow propagates and creates two overlapping menus! :). Should be fixed in development branch now.. Now in master :). Ops! name is actually a global variable for some reason, hence why I've never caught this.\nFeel free to fix it and make a PR to development ;). This was fixed in #646. Now in master :). Thank you very much!. Wow, this is great stuff! I'll have a look a bit later today :). Great! I'll merge this tomorrow when I am back home at my workstation :)I.

Hi,\nI've briefly looked at the documentation and it seems that you have to make a new script in  package.json called start that does the same thing as the current run script, because GCP expects this.\nOther than that it seems that you can deploy this like any other node application.. Maybe this will allow you to run build script: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript\nI am not familiar with GCP :/. I'm closing this due to inactivity. Feel free to re-open..

Some boards have some issues with networking (connection dropout).\nTry using Luci instead: http://arduino-ip/cgi-bin/luci if you want to configure the board if the problem perists (even after upgrade).\nReference issue: #436\n. Yes, some boards seem to drop the connections intermittently, hence why you are getting this error. I  can't help you there since I'm not affiliated with Arduino in any way.\nTry using Luci instead: http://arduino-ip/cgi-bin/luci if you want to configure the board or log into a shell to perform an upgrade manually.\nI'm closing this issue because it's not an issue with OS.js. This error message is also tracked in a separate repository.\n. Hi,\nSorry for late reply. This file is generated with node osjs build:config (which is in the main build process).. I'm closing this due to inactivity. Feel free to re-open.. Hi. Sorry for late reply, I forgot to make a notification for this. Could you try the development branch and see if this has not been already solved ?. Thanks for letting me know :+1: \n. Not exactly sure why this happened, but apparently using 'mouseup' causes this problem, delaying the callback (with a setTimeout) to the next tick solved it magically. The animation now plays and callback is called.\nI'll have to dig a bit deeper in this, but you can use the development branch. I'll merge this into master this weekend.. > An elephant in the room with this sort of project is that applications are running in the same window, and thus technically have access to any other application's data and state.\nYes. But this depends on how the application is made. You don't have to expose everything to the application class instances.\n\nFor example, what happens when Application A uses React version 15, and Application B uses React version 16?\n\nOS.js uses Webpack for building its apps. So if you bundle all your dependencies, this is not an issue, unless the libraries used share something in the global namespace.\n\nthis issue alone would keep OS.js from having a really useful pluggable architecture.\n\nv3 will have a very different architecture. Based on modern concepts. I built most of this stuff over ten years ago (as a hobby project), so there's lots of areas that needs improvements, for sure, hence v3.\n. ... sorry if the response was a bit lackluster. I was just about to get ready for bed and thought I'd answer it quickly. I'll try again tomorrow :P . Yes, bundling solves this issue as long as the libraries (or frameworks) do not use the window namespace or has some shared root namespace or something like that. Older libraries can cause a mess, for sure!\nLooks like you've pretty much gotten an answer, so I don't have to rewrite my original post. Yay :)\nI'll write a post about v3 when I got something to share. It's mostly been going on in the backround in silence, heh. But I might have something really soon. I'll make sure to let you know about it when it's up ;). @jcrben \n\nWhat do you think about using or allowing typescript for v3?\n\nI'm sure that could be worked out.\n\nAlso, is there a display manager (something like https://github.com/sddm/sddm) in in this project?\n\nI have a somewhat working Debian image that runs OS.js, but there's no DM in there.\nThis is something I really want to look into for v3.. I'm closing this issue now because of https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/671 .\nAs for the TypeScript stuff, this will get attention there :). Hi,\nYou can do a node osjs build --standalone to make a standalone build (which basically just changes a few configuration entries at build time). This means you can use the dist/ directory without having any server attached.\nI think that should solve your issue.. You can also re-configure it to always build as standalone:\n```\nSee defaults in src/conf/000-base.json\nnode osjs config:set --name=connection --value=standalone\nnode osjs config:set --name=authenticator --value=standalone\nnode osjs config:set --name=storage --value=standalone\nnode osjs build:config\n```\n. I think that you got your answer, so I'm closing this issue. Feel free to re-open :)\nYou might be interested in this issue btw: https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/671 . @junland Yes, you can still build it standalone :)\nThe build system will work pretty much the same, just improved. There's a small paragraph in the issue description about this.. @junland I might put up a demo and all the sources this weekend. I can let you know if it's of any interest :). @junland Sorry, but I totally forgot. The sources are now up on this org. account :). @mds325 I don't think I'll make any of the base packages in TS as they are very small, but I will however provide typing [definitions] (.d.ts) for anyone that wants to develop using TS .\nAlso, if things get to a complex point, then TS or Flex will be looked into :). Everything is now up on Github, though not published to npm. So if anyone wants to test this out you'll have to manually override package.json files and use npm link to set things up.\n~~I will update this thread when things are published on npmjs.org :)~~\nEdit: They are up, but only updated every weekend, so if you want to really get your hands down in the action, use git and npm link.\nModules:\n\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-core\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-gui\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-dialogs\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-server\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-cli\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-panels\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-standard-theme\n\nProviders:\n\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-example-provider\n\nPackages:\n\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-example-package\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-xterm-package\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-textpad-package\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-filemanager-package\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-preview-package\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-musicplayer-package\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-htmlviewer-package\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-pdfreader-package\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-calculator-package\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-xpra-package. All core modules now up on npmjs.org: https://www.npmjs.com/org/osjs\n\nI'll leave the packages for later... they're not hard to set up anyway.\nNot sure what schedule I'm going to set for publishing yet, but since I started on this day... I'll make it every saturday.. A community member was asking about how to easily prototype applications, and it brought up something interesting.\nI put together these bundles so you can do this in whatever platform you want, a basic example being: https://jsfiddle.net/andersevenrud/m94jt9ct/5/\nIf you want to test this out yourself, just use these resources:\n\nhttps://www.os-js.org/testing/osjs.js\nhttps://www.os-js.org/testing/osjs.css\n\nAt some point I'll probably set up proper CDN for this with automatic building. These links are made from my local machine using Webpack and these files:\njs\n// index.js\nimport * as gui from '@osjs/gui';\nwindow.OSjs = window.OSjs || {};\nwindow.OSjs.GUI = gui;\ncss\n// index.scss\n@import \"@osjs/gui/index.scss\";\n@import \"@osjs/standard-theme/index.scss\";\nEdit: Another example https://jsfiddle.net/andersevenrud/qe9s1df9/12/. I've started a draft of the basic manual here: ~~https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/wiki/v3-documentation~~\nhttps://manual.os-js.org/v3/\nI also released proper tagged versions of everything today (and updated dependency definitions), so things should be smooth sailing.\nPlease note that I have not polyfilled anything yet, so iOS/Android, Opera and IE will probably not init properly.. Thought I'd share the progress with you guys. Here's a list of currently available features as of today's release:\n\nExtensions via configuration\nWindow media queries\nTheme support (w/icons)\nDialog support (w/default set of dialogs)\nPanels support (w/default set of panel items)\nNotifications, Tray icons, \nGUI Components for Hyperapp (note: these are not finished)\nAuthentication support (note: no modules yet published)\nVFS Transports and Mountpoints (note: only system module provided at the moment)\nSession saving and loading\nWebSockets and HTTP requests for applications\nCustom distribution (customization, embedding, etc)\nBasic touch input support\n... and more\n\nThere's been some more work in the manual as well, so it should be fairly easy to play around with these features.\nNext up, I'll probably be focusing on finishing the GUI components and add add some authentication modules.\nNote The @osjs/core module was renamed to @osjs/client.. Another quick update:\n\nNow works on Safari (and iOS) and some other browser quirk fixes\nFixed the default theme not compiling\nSupport custom Auth adapters\nSupport custom Settings adapters\nLogin customization support\nAdd default client+server adapters for settings and auth\nStandalone mode\nAnd your usual suspects as dependency updates and general improvements\nStarted on implementation of applying settings (so I'll have a settings app ready soon)\nCreated @osjs/common and moved code shared between client/server there\n\nI've also added two auth adapters:\n\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-sqlite-auth\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-pam-auth\n\nManual has been updated with relevant documentation.. @filips123 \n\nWhat about some web browser. (I don't know if this is possible and this is just an idea\n\nIt's somewhat possible. I'll look into the project you linked.\n\nAlso, add some mail client and MS Office like programs.\n\nThat's something I'd like to do, if I can find some time.\n\nIn the top bar, show icon instead of text \"Menu\", like in v2.\n\nIcon will be applied down the line.\n\nSome apps, like Calculator, don't have icons in the menu. Intend, they have OS.js icon.\n\nYes, I'm aware. None of the apps are finished for v3.\n\nTab key don't work in text editors.\n\nNoted.\n\nRight click doesn't work. It doesn't do anything.\n\nIt's not supposed to (at least yet).\n\nWhen I move window around, the title text of window is selected. Also, mouse cursor is changed to moving cursor.\n\nI thought I had disabled user-select when a window is moved. I'll look into that. The cursor is supposed to change.\n\nWindow names in top bar are cropped.\nThe icons in the window are too close together and they are overlapping.\n\nYes, and several other minor UI glitches. It's not done yet.\n\nResizing window doesn't work.\n\nIt does, just only from south-east at the moment.\n\nFile manager doesn't work. It opens alert with text \"TypeError: HEAD or GET Request cannot have a body.\".\n\nI'll look into that.\n\nMaybe there are also some other bugs. Also, some features and functionalities from v2 don't work in v3.\n\nMost likely yes. It's a work in progress.. @filips123 I've fixed the following (and will release new version this weekend):\n\nIcon added to the menu in panel\nThe text selection problem while moving should be fixed\nFixed overlapping/cut-off window controls\nIssues with tab on certain inputs\n\nIf you discover something else, please create an issue in https://github.com/os-js/osjs-client :). @filips123 The issue with HEAD or GET Requests cannot have a body should also be fixed. So stay tuned for that :). @filips123 I just published the updates.. Been a while since I've published an update here. A lot has happened, so I thought I'd note down a list of completed features as of now:\n\nServer w/Websocket, authentication, etc.\nServer authentication and group support\nCLI w/building and plugin support\nBuild system over Webpack w/simplified API\nPanels w/library and custom integration support\nDialogs w/library and custom integration support\nVFS w/mountpoints and custom integration support\nLocalization support (No translations yet)\nLogin w/customization support\nSession w/save and restore\nSettings incl. applications etc.\nNotifications and Tray Icons\nApplication socket/http support\nApplication worker support\nWindows w/all the things you'd expect\nBasic touch suport and support for screen-size based optimizations\nThemes\nProvide modules for authentication\nProvide examples for packages and service providers\nManual (with pretty good coverage atm)\nSupport all platforms for building and development\n\nI probably forgot something...\nSome features currently under development/planned:\n\nPut i18n strings in translation file(s)\nRe-sizable windows from all corners\nFinishing up GUI library\nWidget support\nAnimations\nMore apps. Including one for managing user settings (finally)\nMore themes\n\nThanks to everyone that has reported bugs and requested features. Most of the features in v2 is now in v3! So... I guess it's not that far off from going into a beta :). Time for another update :slightly_smiling_face: \nI've added the following since last post:\n\nTranslation file support\nSupport custom Login (adapter)\nGUI Library basic components now stable\nGUI Library general improvements\nCompability (should now render correctly on Safari and iOS)\nUpdated all applications to use latest updates\nCLI improvements\nCLI can now generate packages via package:create\nExtensive manual updates, now also in master\nMore work on Widgets\nLogo support on login UI\nA PM2 stats provider now available. Another quick one for 'ya :)\n\nUpdates:\n\nService Providers can now have dependencies and resolves upon boot\nVFS abstraction updated to cover non-standard filesystems (i.e. not a traditional folder structure)\nVFS now supports watching (client can reload things based on filesystem changes, disabled by default)\nAdded the 'visibility' attribute on Windows (controls if can be showed in ex window list in panel)\nBasic UI animations\nGUI improvements\nCLI improvements\nLogging improvements\nManual updates\nAll relevant dependencies updated\nAll relevant packages updated\n\nNew applications:\n\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-draw-application\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-ace-application\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-strophejs-application\n\nNew providers:\n\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-gapi-provider\n\nVFS adapters:\n\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-gdrive-adapter. @filips123 \n\n\nWhat about Docker image and CI integration? \n\nI can provide a docker setup, sure. The procedure is basically the steps mentioned in the installation documentation, but having a set of docker-compose  configurations might be handy (to pick if you want auth by default for example). What would you want to see ?\nCI will be set up once I commit all tests and have my org account properly set up in third parties.\n\nAlso, what about other cloud storage adapters like OneDrive, Dropbox, Box...\n\nI just added basic Google Drive support. Others will come when I get to it (or someone else steps up).\n\nWill there be build with all applications, providers and adapters included?\n\nI could possibly provide a CLI command to make a \"default setup\" with a selection of packages, etc. What do you think ?\n\nAlso, could you make online v3 demo?\n\nYeah. I've set up a new server that I'll migrate the web-page to, as well as set up a v3 demo. This will probably involve Docker :)\n. @filips123 \n\nAnd there should be support to install and set up other themes, adapters and providers.\n\nThis is done with the CLI by default,, which you have access to via Docker.\n\nYou should also include support for Vagrant.\n\nNot sure if there's a point in that. Setting up a Vagrant image just consists of the three steps in the installation guide. It's better to let the developer set up their own.\nDoes anyone actually use Vagrant anymore ? :D \n\nMaybe something like npm install && npm run build:default?\n\nMaybe having it called install:basic would be a bit more telling. Or just an interactive command line thing where you pick from a list of things (install:wizard or something like that).\n\nWill standalone builds builds and webhosts (https://manual.os-js.org/installation/) be supported in v3?\n\nStandalone support is already included. Webhosts support depends heavily on what kind of host. Since there is no more PHP server, you cannot just \"drop-in\" like that. You need nodejs suport and a way to start the server (which is where Docker comes in handy).\n\nAlso, will older v2 apps be compatible with v3 (or opposite)? \n\nThere is zero compability between v2 and v3. If you made applications in v2 using only third-party stuff it should be possible to convert.\nOne Exception is widget-s. They've stayed more or less the same.\n\nCould you make upgrade guide or something like this?\n\nThere's a document I will use for this whevenever possible https://manual.os-js.org/v3/guide/migrate/\nIt will at least contain any future migration steps required.. @filips123 As to your questions about adding all of these applications. Yes, I want to have it all. But I can't possibly do all of that myself.\nAlso, please don't use this thread for bug-reporting. Place issues in their respective repositories. Here's a complete list: https://manual.os-js.org/v3/resource/official/\n\nAdd settings application.\n\nI've mentioned in this thread that it is coming.\n\nsupport to use different login adapters at same time.\n\nThat's a good suggestion!\n\nSome apps, like Calculator, don't have icons in the menu. Intend, they have OS.js icon.\n\nYes, I just haven't added the icons in the metadata yet.\n\nRight click doesn't work. It doesn't do anything.\n\nI don't know what exactly you expect it to do....\n\nWhen I move window around, the title text of window is selected. Also, some of text labels in applications are also selected.\nWhen I move window around, the title text of window is selected. Also, some of text labels in applications are also selected.\nApplication titles and labels are sometimes selected.\n\nI actually can't reproduce this on my machines. I'll maybe have a look at some other setups. Are you sure your theme and dependencies are up to date ? Also, maybe there are just spesific spots this triggers ? If so, some more info would be appreciated.\n\nCanvas in Draw application should be also resized with dragging it.\n\nYup, that's on my TODO list :)\n\nWhen opening the OS.js, login page is shown for about 0.25 seconds even if there is no custom login adapter installed.\n\nThis is because the login always shows (there's a difference between the adapter and UI module), but by default is set up to autofill with demo user. So depending on the connection etc. it might show for longer.\nMaybe setting it to be hidden if autologin is enabled is better - then just display it if an error occured.\n\nAlso, there is an error while installing themes and applications. See #688.\n\nThis has been solved.\n\nWhere are files from File Manager stored? Can they be accessed by hosting OS?\n\nAll files and filesystem operations goes via the virtual filesystem. The OSjs mountpoint is the dist directory, and Home is vfs/{username}. Technically you can host your files anywhere.\n. @filips123 \n\nCropped window names:\n\nI actually improved this yesterday. Comes out in the next update :)\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-panels/commit/230788ad8ebb194bdbba8bcc7f5a98b5e7b843c4. @filips123 \n\nIt should open context menu depending on content that was clicked.\n\nThere's a contextmenu on the desktop (albeit a simple one) and the file views, but on the panel it has not been added yet (some panel functionality also not done).\n\nOn Firefox and Edge, text is selected.'\n\nOkay, thanks. I have should have autoprefix set up in Sass, but I'll look into it.\n\nAlso, will there be support for choosing application to open file, like in v2?\n\nThis is supported as of latest release (if you try to open a file that has multiple apps supported), but not added to the context menu. I also need to add the permanent checkbox thingy.\n. @filips123 \n\nOn Firefox and Edge, text is selected.'\n\nOkay, thanks. I have should have autoprefix set up in Sass, but I'll look into it.\n\n\nSeems like I was wrong :blush: https://github.com/os-js/osjs-client/commit/5db9ca447f11a98c8f4fc0f0a0e9bce206b1983e. @filips123 I've added a basic Docker setup now https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/commit/c86fba8c680f71a2a7d2d29a15dc4c0e320dc789. @filips123 I also published a new version of @osjs/client with the following:\n\nFixed user-select\nFixed login not blocking boot procedure\nHide the login UI if autologin is set to prevent the \"blinking\"\nBetter handling of window zIndex\n\nI also published the @osjs/panels package with changes mentioned earlier.. @filips123 Also a new @osjs/standard-theme build to center the window title ;). @filips123 \n\nMaybe this could be in settings so users could configure this.\n\n~~Yes, that's a given. You can also change theme with the desktop context menu.~~\nEdit: Oh,  you meant the window title position. That could be useful, yes :)\n\nAlso, maybe you could also support icons on the left and Windows-style icons. This should be in settings.\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"icons on the left\" and \"widows style icons\".. > With \"icons on the left\" I meant that the window icons would be on the left side of window. Currently, they are on the right.\nOh, the window \"controls\". I see. That could easily be customized -- added to notes.\n\nWith \"widows style icons\" I meant icons that are on Windows.\n\nThe goal is to have it separated into three categories: decoration, styles and icons, so probably, yes.\n. > There could also be support for panel at the bottom or other sides.\nYes. The idea is to match the features of v2, with some minor exceptions.. Just tested it, and it's just a matter of flipping it in CSS :)\n\n. I have a Debian package template for v2 that can be converted for v3. It just sets up a init.d script and runs a custom C program when the X server launches (which is just a libwebkit implementation). I experimented a bit with it, but never got to making any ISO or something like that... I'll consider it at a later point probably. Right now I just wanna concentrate on making the beta release.. @filips123 Some kind of installation wizard could be nice, yes :). @filips123 CI is now also up btw.\n\n. @SpaceboyRoss01 \n\nI think a Unix like vfs design would be better than Windows's VFS design. I mean a format of /dir/subdir/file instead of Drive:\\Path\\\n\nThere is no \"root filesystem\" in OS.js, so the VFS operates with a form of URI-s, ex: mountpoint:/path/to/file. So it's not a UNIX, nor Windows \"design\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier. > Couldn't a Unix design be implemented? It's less confusing for certain people.\nIf you could maybe explain how that would be confusing ?\nThe goal of the UI and all the abstraction is that the end-user won't even know how the underlying system works, they just go to a location and save a file like you would normally anywhere else (think modern Windows or any other Desktop Linux platform -- and how they present this to the end-user).\nAnd in terms of the developer-side, it's all documented. And URI-s are a well known standard.\nThat said, since it's all virtual and the abstraction is pretty good, you can actually make an interface that presents everything as you would in for example Linux -- but, I can't look into that until I have released the beta.\n. @SpaceboyRoss01 There's actually a community user that is working on a CLI module, where this might have been taken into consideration. I haven't followed up in a while...which reminds me, I should probably do that :blush: . @SpaceboyRoss01 Bug hunting is always much appreciated :). @SpaceboyRoss01 You mean like the \"About\" application I had in v2, or are you trying to use the dialog API ?. Sounds like all you need is just to open a secondary window with a button. That's probably simpler than to set up a custom dialog (they are usually intended for some kind of input/ouput).\n\nhttps://manual.os-js.org/v3/tutorial/dialog/#programatic\nhttps://manual.os-js.org/v3/tutorial/dialog/#dialog-gui. > I found a bug with opening a window. When there are no focused windows and a new window is opened, it's transparent the window beneath appears visible.\n\nYou have to call .focus() on your newly created window to give it focus.\n\nI've never seen a window manager that does this effect on windows.\n\nThis is how I've set up my personal desktop. It's to prevent focus stealing when a popup window appear etc.\nI can possibly add an option to automatically focusing the windows.. @SpaceboyRoss01 I've opened an issue about in the appropriate repo: https://github.com/os-js/osjs-client/issues/12. @SpaceboyRoss01 Btw, theres a gitter room you can join to discuss development \nhttps://gitter.im/os-js/OS.js/development.

This only works with the release I just published.. Since I've gotten a lot of questions about it; I've put together a list of TODOs (which is sort of a basic roadmap):\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/andersevenrud/ebfc22ef75c6686cc2d9a6e1191a8405\nI'm updating this list as things come to mind, but I've dedicated a section for the beta release. As you can see, it's not far off :blush: . Things got set back a month or so due to some personal stuff, but it's all in full progress again.\nI've actually ticked off pretty much all TODOs that I wanted to have done. So expect a beta/rc soon!\nI also added back support for Legacy browsers (requires a couple of setup steps https://manual.os-js.org/v3/guide/deploy/#legacy-browsers) because I got some questions about this. The reason it has not worked 100% until now is because of some dependencies was not in ES5 -- but has now been resolved completely as of latest release(s).. @filips123 \n\nIt looks good, but it still lacks some features and design of v2. Some apps are still very basic and with poor design.\n\nMy current goal is to finish my TODO list, which involves some application improvements etc. There are actually more internal features in v3 than v2, but I suppose you mean visually. If you think they are poor, please go ahead and make some improvements yourself. PRs are much welcome.\n\nWill there be support for fullscreen mode and icons on desktop? What about touch menu or some mobile OS like theme?\n\nYes, this will all be implemented.. @filips123 The apps are written in regular javascript, so if you have some exeperience with that you can probably find your way around.\nBut anyway, things will improve down the line -- I have quite a few todos, issues and the likes on this open :). @filips123 Usually once a week or something like that.

I'm currently working on finishing conversion of packages from this repo from v3 btw ;) Currently the ace, chat and pdf application is done -- google stuff almost done.\nSo stay tuned for that.. The official Firefox Marketplace was shut down long ago, so this package probably does not function well.. Hi,\nI've noticed this as well. This won't be an issue in the v3 release of this application (which also will have a lot of other improvements), so I'll probably backport some of the stuff to fix this.. I'm hoping to have a beta this summer :). I've pushed the first iteration of the new draw application here: https://github.com/os-js/osjs-draw-application.

I'll make sure to fix this when I get the time. Currently very busy on v3 :). I'm sad to say that I won't be able to backport this into v2 because I simply don't have the time. This is certainly not an issue in v3, which I will be releasing very soon (which basically ends support on v2).. Thanks :). This was fixed in a realease 30 minutes ago. Please run npm update..

Since there's been no activity in this issue since October, I'm closing this.\nIf you have any objections or progress on the matter, just notify me here and I'll re-open :blush: . Firstly, I'm closing this issue because it belongs in your repository :)\nSeems like your webkit does not have the ES2015 features. Maybe you're running an old version or some sort of configuration is required ? AFAIK Webkit added full support back in 2016, so it's a bit strange.\n\nYou don't actually have to write or add any of these polyfills manually, there's a way to do it on build:\nhttps://manual.os-js.org/v3/guide/deploy/#legacy-browsers\n. https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes\n\nChrome's autoplay policies will change in April of 2018 and I'm here to tell you why and how this is going to affect video playback with sound. \nChrome's autoplay policies are simple:\nAutoplay with sound is allowed if: User has interacted with the domain (click, tap, etc.).\n\nSo basically, this should not be an issue when using a login form because the user will do interaction before sound is played.. > It doesn't work with autologin\nYes, exactly.. OS.js actually runs on node, so not sure what you mean by this. Maybe you could elaborate ?. > See, I would like to have a cli with the nodejs+npm. Where is the terminal stay? \nThe terminal app is not in the demo for security reasons. Check out\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-xterm-application\nThere's also a service that allows developers to use processes via node:\nhttps://github.com/os-js/osjs-proc-provider. I only provide Docker images for OS.js. If you need a Linux image, check out @SpaceboyRoss01 project.. Seems like Codepen has an API: https://cpv2api.com/ so that might be possible.\nI actually use it the other way around -- prototyping GUIs inside codepen, ex:\n\nhttps://codepen.io/collection/DqmrWo/\nhttps://codepen.io/collection/AybmNa/. As @SpaceboyRoss01 there's a VFS adapter for Google Drive, so that can be used to store files etc.\n\nBecause there's several ways to connect and store users/settings(database, filesystems, memory, etc.) it  should probably be up to the system administrator to set up backup, mirroring, etc.\nI think MEGA has some sort of API, so it would probably be interesting to looking into adding that as an adapter.. Sure. That should be pretty straight forward with some sort of node library.\nProbably needs some kind of UI in Settings app if users should be able to\ncreate custom connections (i.e. not statically defined in a config).\nOn Sun, Dec 30, 2018, 18:30 SpaceboyRoss01 <notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI second this.  30.12.2018, 09:27, \"Filip \u0160\" notifications@github.com:Add\nVFS adapter for FTP, FTPS, SFTP and other similar file protocols.\n\u2014You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.Reply to\nthis email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/706#issuecomment-450575198, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAJ3DI3sLrgK-GSv9PB5dlP5ZIPZchJvks5u-PhOgaJpZM4ZlAs7\n.\n.

I've created a repo for this with a basic blueprint: https://github.com/os-js/osjs-ftp-adapter\n\nNext step is to look for what ftp library to use, then implement that. So stay tuned :). I've made a bit of progress on this btw. Basic file listing, reading etc. Although I have implemented the methods that manipulates files I have yet to test it because I need to set up my own ftp. I was just using a random linux mirror while testing, heh.\nI settled on https://github.com/realtymaps/promise-ftp because as it wraps the standard ftp library around Promise-s.. I've implemented all of the available FTP methods, but for some unknown reason (at the moment), copying files does not seem to work properly (within the ftp that is, copy from/to other filesystems work, so this is a library bug).\nAfter I've sorted this out this is ready for an initial release :slightly_smiling_face: . For issues with the Yun, please look at https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/issues/436. Nice. The old script I had actually checked if nodejs was installed, and if not selected the appropriate package manager and installed it that way (with user confirmation).

Moved to: https://github.com/andersevenrud/osjs-installers/pull/1. I've started on an Auth0 example using implicit flow and API authorization.

    "luveti": "No problem! I really like this project! Its probably the \"prettiest\" I've seen. Are you looking for some help? \n. Sweet! What do you need help with? I'm good with Javascript and Nodejs so I can help with just about anything\n. Okay cool, I'll go ahead and fork it and work on making some applications. Anything you'd prefer to be made first?\n. Got it! And I was thinking of writing a simple chat application using peer.js lol. Btw whats the default username and password for index.html?\n. Hmmm.. it seems to have been an error with my web server. I got it fixed now though. I'm excited for that nodejs server to be done though, as I dislike php and all the stuff thats required to run it (things like wamp). Nodejs is defiantly a lot better! Atleast thats my opinion\n. I cant seem to get the app to show up in the \"Applications\" menu. Am I missing something? I added it to the apps folder but nothings appearing (btw its basicly a copy of the About app but i changed a few things)\n. Its not that I don't like php or anything. Its just that I really like the single exe that nodejs provides you with. So users can really easily download your web server app then run it without needing to install a PHP and Apache and stuff. Also I forgot to mention that I'm working on a windows machine. So this bash file wont work on here. Is there any alternatives to using a script?\n. Found out how to! All I have to do is add it to the packages.json file at the root of the project\n. Hey theres nothing wrong with being on windows! Haha (actually the only reason I use this shitty OS and not linux is because of some of the games I play and my love for Notepad++) But would you be okay with me creating a \"platform agnostic\" version of these scripts using nodejs? (this could be useful in the future)\n. Btw I think we should probably move this chat off of the issues list. Would you like to use an IRC or something to chat?\n. Okay goodnight! Talk to you tomorrow haha, I should have a simple chat application done by then\n. ",

    "junland": "@andersevenrud I know it #34 you were discussing using ws over socket.io, I found this article that might be of some use. https://medium.com/@denizozger/finding-the-right-node-js-websocket-implementation-b63bfca0539\n. +1 Props for all the translators :) \n. @andersevenrud I would look at QNAP's QTS 4.1 and Synologys DSM interfaces, they have demos on there sites if want some good reference points for mobile implementation. Also might want to check out https://github.com/andy928/xpenology the open source version of Synologys DSM. It's the whole OS with the interface so might have to build it and run it on a VM to actually view the web pages or just dig around in the repo to find the web pages. Also one feature I don't see is a login page. \n. @andersevenrud No problem!\n\nYou mean OS.js ?\n\nYes. :)\n. @andersevenrud Ahhhh okay, I'll maybe try to get that started or something.\nAlso another thing that I was thinking was a terminal. One terminal for the actual desktop and another for the actual server that it's running on. It prolly won't be implement right now but I would like this to be a potential app down the road.\n. @andersevenrud That would be interesting. I'll look into that.\n. @andersevenrud I was looking around Github (Again) and found this project: https://github.com/symbiose/symbiose They have a working terminal (Seems a bit buggy, but looks promising), dock, brackets, software center, and some other applications. Don't know if we want to fork some of the code (It's under MIT licenses so I think were okay.).\n. @andersevenrud Yea, I looked into it more and it's all over the place. But they have a pretty well featured product. \n\nI would really love to be able to pull the apps from there, but I don't have the time (would save me massive amounts of time... and make beta come way faster). Maybe you have time to look at it ?\n\nYea I'm looking through it now to see if I can find that, at least we can pull that dock from there. \n\nI have actually got a working Terminal here that I've been experimenting with. Maybe I should clean it up and add it? \n\nIf you want, I'm more concerned that if we add it, that may introduce more bugs that we would have to spend more time on. But that's up to you. :)\n. > It would be nice to separate one spesific application, then try to figure out the dependency tree of it (like, which namespaces and libraries are used). I would like to see that. One can immediately see what kind of job lies ahead.\nOr some really good documentation lol \n\nThere would be no new additions to the core, so bugs will not happen. Applications are isolated entirely from the rest of OS.js... so it's considered \"safe\" to make adjustments and additions there :)\n\nAh, I see :)\n. @andersevenrud Will do.... Speaking of API if I wanted to add more functions to the API what tools do you use to write that? Do you use a API framework?\n. @andersevenrud Nice!\n. @andersevenrud You may be able to answer this but I've been going through some of the packages and I'm just trying to wrap my brain around building apps from the ground up. Is there another way to build / write apps? Also I can do the logic, but design wise it seems cumber sum when you don't have a preview of the Windows already available to you. I just would like develop apps faster and effectively.\nOn another note, since we can use Broadway do you know if the server uses the GPU to render GTK apps or is just rendered client side? \n. > Yes, there is :) http://os.js.org/doc/tutorials/create-application.html\nYup already looked over that, it's just seems like alot I guess. Or maybe it's just becuase I'm lazy :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: .\n\nI have an Interface Designer in the works (almost ready) :)\n\nNice.\n\nI usually just open my app, quit and save session, then reload page (F5). Just make sure that sounds are disabled or I will go insane.\nI realise this can be a bit hard at the moment... the thing is, I write code for an hour or two, and then test it in the browser........ so getting this IDE/Interface Designer going will be good for newcomers (and those not as extreme as me).\n\nYea, I do that too but like I said I'm a little lazy and I always think of others who are trying to write apps that don't have the patience / time / expertise to write apps. lol.\n\nBroadway is running completely separate from OS.js. It works almost like VNC (Remote Desktop). If the X server is running on a physical monitor it will also use a bit of GPU power. The nice thing about X is that you don't need to run it on a GPU or monitor :)\n\nNice. Also I'm working on a docker files so that should be pulled in through a link to the repo or just the docker build file.\n. > Well, I've tried to make it as easy as possible. The entire API is fully documented... so for a somewhat seasoned programmer it should not be a problem getting going.\nYea, the API does take some of the guess work out of interacting with the desktop itself and VFS.\n\nI also realise that people are different and might not have the patince or have a whole different perspective on programming... It all boils down to that I am working alone on this and I simply do not have the time nor resources to cater to a broader audience.\nBut, hey. That is the reason this is open-source! Comments like these are priceless and really helps me get some perspective on things. And if you find anything in the docs that are unclear or you'd want to see simplified etc. Let me know! I can open-source my documentation generation (which I also wrote myself... I am a bit crazy) and make it editable by the community!\n\nThat's true, but that's why we have Github and other contributors to make time....\n\nWould be sweet to have Docker deployment. I already provide Vagrant (thanks to a github user). Diversity is nice :)\n\nYup!\n\nIf I make an \"developer service\" (that runs in the background) that will show up as an icon in the panel. This icon has these options:\n\nInteresting, Why not feed it through a Server Side API command instead of a button? Maybe both?\n. @andersevenrud Ahhhhhhhh that would be cool.\n. @andersevenrud Cool beans. Also I've been talking with another project called NodeOS to see if they need a desktop. It would be nice, because they can fork the project and also help development on our side. :)\n. @andersevenrud lol\n. @andersevenrud Rather interesting conversation on the NodeOS project. Am I right? Hope it's not too much of a inconvenience to write all that stuff. :)\n. @andersevenrud Yea it seems like it lol.\n. @andersevenrud Also with the new GUI will we still need to implement a copy/paste actions? Since it's HTML it's easier to copy and paste content.\n. @andersevenrud What needs to be done to ensure compatibility? \n. Got it :)\n. @andersevenrud Awesome! \n. \n. @andersevenrud I can go ahead and write up a front page and maybe a mockup of a app page for packages. I'm thinking of using Semantic UI but I wanted to get your input on a frontend. I figured instead of starting from scratch I would just use a already built front-end.\n. @andersevenrud Awesome, I'll probably just start with a couple of example landings and we can go off from there.\n. \nHere is a very rough mockup of the front landing of the webstore. It's using Materialize as the front end framework. I can go ahead and create a repo for the store and then you can merge it on to your repo @andersevenrud. Still haven't figured out scripting and linking stuff, it's not really my forte but I try todo the best I can. \n. Awesome, I'll go ahead and do that.\n\nScripting of what ? :)\n\nGetting the packages read from the package repo. :)\n. Alright, I'm looking into API's as we speak lol.\n. @andersevenrud Alright I was able to test a couple of devices, so here is what I found\nWindows 8 Desktop - Worked fine, no problems with single or multi-windows open. (Firefox / Chrome)\nWindows 8 Touch - I have a Dell touch screen monitor so I can test this out, no problems with any programs. Maybe a little lag here and there but that's probably because I have a very low spec VM running but we can probably get more optimization with later down the road. (Firefox / Chrome)\nAndroid Tablet - Worked fine, little lag due to the VM and that it was transmitting over a saturated Wifi link but handled itself pretty well despite those conditions. Only thing that I couldn't use was the paint program to draw a happy face. Also note that it scaled well when I would go from portrait mode to landscape mode and I tried landscape to portrait. Although I did have a graphical glitch when I would separate two program windows and go to landscape to portrait. (Chrome)\n\n\n. I found a JS library to handle touch, I know right now you can do it because touch is just emulating a mouse, but this library handles multi-touch and gestures. http://hammerjs.github.io/\n. @andersevenrud Ahhh yea that's fine. :)\n. @andersevenrud Where would the 3rd party libraries go? Let's say I wanted to add io.js (Just as a example)? Because I want to add bash support (Even though I can just do it with child process in pure js) I would like to add a js library where I can just call bash commands from the server. I might even just go ahead and just write a API call :).\n. > You have a couple of options:\nAwesome, and just specify require(my-library.js:global) in the main js files of the packages that require that specific package?\n\nFYI If you are planning on making something future-proff, I'd suggest using gui-ng branch to avoid any \nrewrites\n\nNoted!\n\nI am also changing the configuration stuff (simplified) in this branch, so a heads up there too.\n\nCool!\n. @andersevenrud Got it! \n. Looks good. @andersevenrud Don't burn yourself out, take a little rest for a day or two. :)\n. Ahhhh Okay thanks!\n. :+1: \n. :+1: Nice. Good job! @andersevenrud \n. @andersevenrud Is that better? :)\n. Actually I'll just whip up a bash script\n. Just about to type that out lol.\n. @andersevenrud So to clarify, were going from a CSS / JS based window to a CSS / HTML (JS would be optionally) for apps? \n. @andersevenrud Ah okay, I think I understand now. \n. @MrSchism I think so now that I look at the previous packages such as the calculator app. \n. @andersevenrud Looks good. Does it scale (Or does it have) when resizing?\n. @andersevenrud Nice! \n. @andersevenrud The Scheme file looks fine.\n. @andersevenrud Nope, I think the scheme file's name conventions are good. Although I think we should change these things.\ngrow -> grow-enabled\nshrink -> shrink-enabled\nbasis (Stay the same unless there's a better name for this)\nfill -> fill-enabled\nexpand -> expand-enabled\nWhen I think of grow, shrink, fill, etc I think I can change the properties such Can grow to 50px to 100px. Just my take on it.\n. @andersevenrud Got it :)\n. @andersevenrud Nice! I'll have to look at it!\n. @andersevenrud Yea just saw the commits, I have no experience with jQuery. But it looks cool what it can do!\n. Just another thing from me to learn on top of all the other cool languages out there. :/\n. Your my hero @andersevenrud geeezzzz\n. @andersevenrud Awesome!\n. @andersevenrud Your my programming hero lol. Keep it up!\n. @andersevenrud Sure am! (I just woke up, it's morning in my timezone.)\n. @andersevenrud Awesome!\n. @andersevenrud  What VPS do you use or are going to use? If so I have a $10 USD product code for Digital Ocean.\n. @andersevenrud Ahhhhhhhh thats cool \n. @andersevenrud Alright I've tested with Linux Mouse / Keyboard, Linux Touch, Andriod Mobile, and Andriod Tablet. Here's what I found:\nLinux Desktop / Touch:\n- Pressing tab key in Writter app makes the cursor disappear and I can type text into it. However it's fixed by just pressing backspace.\n- Music Player works however it does not have a time display a time slider so I can go forwards or backwards in the song. All I can do is pause / play the song.\n- Placing the menu bar on the bottom chops the bottom most of the app menu. (Firefox / Chrome)\n  \nAndroid Tablet / Phone:\n- The glitch graphic glitch that messed up the screen when rotating the screen from landscape to portrait seems to be gone.  (Phone / Tablet)\n- App menu is slightly sliced off , this happens in both portrait and landscape modes. (Phone Only) (Chrome)\n  \n- Putting the panel on the bottom does not activate app menu. (Phone and Tablet)\nThink that's all I came across.\n. > Seeking is not available simply because the server is not configured for it. I'm adding something custom >later. Some fileformats supports seeking in the browser, but others use the server.\n\nNo mobile CSS or functionality has been done yet. Only touch support.\nFor mobile I'd have to implement a fully custom solution simply because of the lack of screen real-estate.\n\nGot it.\n\nDid not find any technical glitches or bugs ? :) I actually found a few minor ones just as I deployed the >thing, hehe.\n\nWell I updated after the latest changes, on the phone it fixed the chopping of the app menu but that only works in landscape mode, portrait mode still has the same problem. However when you do activate the app menu in landscape mode then rotate it to portrait it fixes it but it leaves a large black box at the bottom and has some artifacts.\n\nWhat did you come across?\n\nNot able to reproduce this one. Might be a platform spesific issue. Will have to investegate further.\nIt is a bit weird that backspace fixes it because that key is not special like the Tab which is designed to >jump to next/previous field.\nFirefox, or Chrome ?\n\nFirefox and Chrome.\nI retested it and saw that on actually on Firefox when you hit tab it highlight (Boxes) the title of the current tab. Also in Chrome, it tabs over to the address bar (Not the search bar). Looks like it's just a tab order or something. :)\n. > Yeah. But as I stated earlier there is no actual customized UI for the mobile platforms yet, so it will be >ugly no matter what device.\nSorry about that, didn't parse that correctly :)\n\nThat is just the thing though, there is no tab ordering. It has all been disabled because the browser >default events will not work in this case as they were intended for basic HTML forms (Example: you >have tabs with multiple inputs, if you tab until an input in another tab is selected it will not work because >it is \"invisible\", so some custom detection must be done).\nIt's most likely a platform spesific issue. I'm guessing the event is not blocked properly. I'll have to fire >up some VMs and do some extensive testing on that.\n\nYea, it's a minor bug but shouldn't hinder the release of the beta. :)\n. @andersevenrud It was on Linux. Maybe it's just my machine.... :/\n. Ubuntu 14.04 with Cinnamon DE. Firefox ver 39.0.3 \n. @andersevenrud Sure! \n. Lol, what did you assume?\n. @andersevenrud Nope, now it doesn't highlight the tab, but still no tab :(. I do like to point out that Textpad can tab through text so maybe look at that one.\n. Yay for communication over the web!\n\nWut ?\n\nPreviously to the new changes, when I would press tab in Writer the cursor would highlight the active tab in my browser. Now with the new changes it isn't doing that. \n\nThe Textarea and Richtext are two entirely different things. In fact, the richtext is not a text area at all, >but a editable HTML area. So the same rules does not apply here :/\n\nAwww man....\n\nI cannot reproduce the problem anymore on any of my virtual machines or browsers. I was before the >commit. Are you using the demo site or local setup ?\n\nLocal...I am doing a grunt command after each pull and using the start-node-dev.sh\n. > If you are using dist-dev you don't have to do this unless a theme has changes or server patches were >done. So if you look when you do a git pull and src/themes and src/server-* was not changes, just reload >browser! :)\nAh okay!\n\nGood. Then it was solved! If OS.js now no longer loses focus.\nI do realize the tab character is not inserted before the cursor, but Richtext implementation is far from >done :)\n\nTrue, you may not have the tab insert implemented but at least when I press tab and start typing it doesn't start typing in my address bar.\n. @andersevenrud I'm free for the most part of tomorrow. :)\n. @andersevenrud Lol you finally found the subreddit? HAAAAAAAA I posted that, was going to tell you about that but I was a little busy. \n. @andersevenrud Nope not really, I went ahead and just answered peoples concerns / comments. I was fairly surprised at how much response it got! I think one or two people were working on there own JS desktops and wanted to look at the code. One of them complimented on your code saying that your styling was really close to his and it was really good!\n. @andersevenrud Yup, just pulled down some changes. So I'm about to fire it up and see what I can find!\n. @andersevenrud Will do here's what I found:\n- Putting the panel on the bottom and enabling the touch menu covers the better half of the panel.\n\n- When saving a file in Textpad I can't highlight the default / place cursor to erase it the name, I have to scroll with the arrow keys to clear the text area.\n- When renaming a file in Textpad (Using the \"Save as\") it creates a duplicate file but with the new name. This also happens in the Writer app.\n\n- Writer, Textpad, and Draw don't prompt you if want to save if you have entered text or drawings into there application.\n- When logging out with all applications opened I am prompted if I wanted to save my session. Picking \"Yes\" starts up all the applications that I opened, but when clicking \"No\" and logging back in, it brings back my current session with the applications. \n- Closing all the applications then signing out without saving the session it still opens all the applications that I have closed when signing back on.\nPositives:\n- Changing background went well.\n- Snapping of corners was good.\n- Disabled animations worked.\n- No graphical glitches reported.\n. @andersevenrud Awesome I'll take a look...\n\nDuplicate ? The behaviour of \"Save As\" is to create a new file... it does not delete the old file. Am I >missing somehting here ?\n\nReally? \nAh okay, it does the same thing when I do it in Geddit. I guess I said that because in Windows it just rewrites over the original file with the new name..... My bad. lol\n\nMaybe some clarification in the text is required. It asks if you want to save current session. So no means.... well, no. And that will not erase the previous session. Maybe adding a checkbox or something there would be nice also\n\nYea, whoops. I'll take a look at it. It's still kinda the morning, I haven't woken up. :P\n. > > When saving a file in Textpad I can't highlight the default / place cursor to erase it the name, I have to >>scroll with the arrow keys to clear the text area.\n\nFixed (I think)\n\nYup looks good!\n\n\nPutting the panel on the bottom and enabling the touch menu covers the better half of the panel.\n\nShould be fixed now\n\nYup, looks good!\n\nIt does ? I don't think I have ever experienced that, becase \"As...\" means \"new\" in a sense :p \n\nYea, at least that' what I think it does... HA.\n\nI'm having the same problem... except it the clock is soon 20:00. hehe\n\nHaha\n. > It seems that this is ready for a merge now Oo I am a bit scared. Care to take a few minutes to perfrom a final test ?\nYup I'll ahead and test to make sure. :)\n. > You will now get a confirmation dialog if you try to close, open or create new file when content has been altered.\n\nNote that it is only implemented in the Textpad application so far, but the ground-work is layed for the others :) Could you test it maybe ?\n\nIt works! :)\nI'm getting a couple of errors when using the dist version of the build when logging out.\n\n<<< /undefined\n!!! 404 /home/junland/Github/OS.js-v2/dist/undefined\n<<< /themes/icons/default/16x16/status/dialog-question.png\n<<< /themes/icons/default/16x16/status/dialog-error.png\n<<< /themes/sounds/default/dialog-warning.oga\n<<< /undefined\n!!! 404 /home/junland/Github/OS.js-v2/dist/undefined\n<<< /themes/sounds/default/dialog-warning.oga\n<<< /packages/default/Settings/scheme.html\n<<< /undefined\n!!! 404 /home/junland/Github/OS.js-v2/dist/undefined\n<<< /packages/default/Settings/scheme.html\n<<< /undefined\n!!! 404 /home/junland/Github/OS.js-v2/dist/undefined\n<<< /undefined\n!!! 404 /home/junland/Github/OS.js-v2/dist/undefined\n<<< /themes/sounds/default/dialog-warning.oga\n\nAre the dev changes not reflected on the dist version?\n. > @junland Opsie. I forgot about Grunt build. Fixed now. Just run grunt core :)\nNice. It works now!\n\n@junland I also added the confirmation to Writer application. Note that this is a bit wonky since it detects changes on an interval... So if you write something and very quickly press close it will not catch it... but it's better than nothing.\n\nYea, noted!\nEverything seems okay. \n. > I am a bit scared, actually. But this version feels better even though some minor stuff is missing, wouldn't you agree ? (And should contain lots less boxes especially graphical stuff)\n\nDo you think it is ready for merge ?\n\nDon't sweat it! You got this!\n. @andersevenrud Yay thanks! :)\n. @andersevenrud Will do!\n. @andersevenrud I'm using my Andriod phone, I can open the apps but when opening apps I can only see the buttons not the entire window.\n. @andersevenrud This is also happening on the andriod tablet as well.\n. @andersevenrud Very odd. I'm still not able to get the windows. I've tried on both Andriod and the Linux desktop but I still get just the app controls but not the full window. Do you think I missed something in the installation process?\n. @andersevenrud Yup. Still the same thing, I'm using Firefox 40.0\n. And Chrome on mobile does the same thing.\n. It's weird because my local install does not work but the demo works for me just fine...\n. @andersevenrud Nope still doesn't work.... :/ lol\n. Here you go.\n\nAnd here is the terminal.\n\n. @andersevenrud Still nothing. I'm running the latest source.......I went ahead and deleted the app and just pulled down a new repo and reinstalled it. Now it works just fine. Very odd....\n. @andersevenrud Same here, but there was no errors in grunt or npm install to my knowledge.\n. @andersevenrud Nice.\n. Awesome! :)\n. Looks good. :)\n\nI, mean. If you have not heard about docker or know how to set it up, you'd probably want to use the official docs :)\n\nTrue lol\n. Cool beans!\n. @andersevenrud that would be cool :)\n. @eraffaelli Ohhhhhhh yesssss that sounds good.\n. +1 for group permissions :)\nAlso HTTPS with Let's Encrypt support?\n. @lordloh Was it the dist version or the dist-dev version?\n. @andersevenrud I was wondering if this might be possible, but when I wanted to create a new icon set using font-awesome, I saw that there was so many categories and icons in /src/client/themes/icons/ that it would almost be impossible to replace the current icon set with a custom one. (Maybe there a grunt command that I'm missing or something.) Anyways, was wondering if it would be possible to just take the icons that are used in the base OS.js instance (with default apps and WM) and place them into a \"core icon\" set and the the rest of the icons that are not used put them in a \"extended\" icon folder (With the appropriate sizes of course.).... TL;DR: Better / refine folder structure for icons so that its easier to pick out which ones are used on the default instance of OS.js. :) \n. > OS.js uses GTK (Gnome) icon themes, hence the directory structure and the name of the icons. There's a plethora of icon packs, hence why I chose it.\nYes, however I know the material theme has to within material guide lines, and if people were to use the material theme by default and want a cohesive UI they would have to swap out the default icons with the correct material icons (Which google provides.). :) \n\nUpdated the script and list so the output is sorted -- may be a bit easier on the eyes.\n\nNice I'll have to look at it :)\n. @andersevenrud I was thinking about doing that just haven't had the time to go and do it :)\n. > Are you trying to use jQuery ? :)\nI guess so, I think jQuery is embedded into .js file\n\nThis is a bit redundant. You already load them from metadata.json file :)\n\nYea, I wasn't sure if there was any difference. I loaded it from the scheme then tested it out. Come to find out that it doesn't work. So I loaded it into the  metadata.json file and just forget to to remove the scheme.html is there a conflict with having jquery like that or is there a conflict with how I loaded the materialize files?\n. > Just took a peek in the docs, and it says: \"One last thing to note is that you have to import jQuery before importing materialize.js!\", so you have to add that too to your meta :)\nWhoops, guess well I did do this before going to be and I was really tired. :/\n\nYou won't get any conflicts here. OS.js has no dependencies to begin with in the client, so you can mix and mash however you want.\n\nAh okay! Good to know!\n. I'm not using a iframe par say, I just used the regulars OS.js and stripped the OS.js GUI out and just added custom CSS / HTML \n. Yea, I placed Jquery into the metadata file and it worked :) \n. Will do :) You could just exclude the text and just have the icons.\n. This my be out of the scope of how OS.js is themed, but maybe for the touch menu could be something like this below? (Click the button in the center.)\nhttp://swart.in/LaunchPad/#\nJust a thought, thinking in terms of phones / tablets. It's cool because it has a search feature for apps.\n. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. :) \n. Nice!\n. Riot would be pretty cool. Its pretty lightweight too.. Will v3 still have options to build standalone (E.g Nginx, Apache, etc.)? Also is there anything changing with the build system?. Ahhh okay, guess I missed it. Sounds good!. @andersevenrud sounds good! I'd be happy to try it out. . ",
    "RyanRiffle": "Awesome Thanks! I will check it out.\n. @andersevenrud Honestly it is a major relief just to have the function declarations easy to find, even if they do not have a description. It's looking good. I still need to try and help some with that. I'll look tomorrow, its bed time for me.\n. @andersevenrud I haven't looked far into but maybe you could provide some insight about the intended security. When Login/Logout is implemented how do you see the security working? Do you plan on OS.js running as a server for all users and dishing out an forked process of itself setuid() and setguid() of the user? Or do you plan on it being a single user environment and changing the owner of the process to that user alone. I would like to assist on the Login/Logout part of the desktop.\n. That helps. I figured it was being run with startx ./whatever.sh -- :1. Got to keep users in their place and keep them from accessing files they don't have permissions to.\n. Thoughts on using Socket.io? It provides both through one interface.\n. The main reason I suggested Socket.IO was, in my opinion, that it would make the api code clear and concise. From what I gather from ws is that it is just a websocket implementation. Socket.IO has ajax polling and websockets allowing for one object prototype to handle both without having to provide two separate implementations for all api calls. Granted I have not done much research on ws aside from the project readme.\n. @andersevenrud Ohh I understand now. I am still parsing through the projects code, I must not have understood completely. That would not be too bad then. Sorry about that.\n. Awesome! Thanks. I havent got a chance to look hard at the application api to see how it can be integrated better, but I believe it would not be too bad\n. @andersevenrud \n- Opening and loading of files is still something that needs to be done almost completely in Poe, so loading/saving is still open for any kind of setup. \n- The toolbar should be easy to move over, since all it does is hook up the buttons to simple functions that use Poe.TextCursor to modify the document. I am just curious about how it would work out since the toolbar is dynamic.\n- The Poe.init() is a good idea.\n- Fonts however I am wondering. Poe.FontManager could be refactored to just accept font-family names instead of loading the actual font file, the same way OS.js does (if that is right). \n@andersevenrud @MrSchism The problem is that Poe is written in coffeescript, not js. That requires yet another dependency, or convert it to javascript either by rewriting or coffee2js. Any thoughts on whether porting would be necessary?\n. @andersevenrud I am working on it.\n@MrSchism I am adding some wrappers right now to get the window to show up. A little bit of a headache ...\n. @andersevenrud I need a way to get a move event from the window in order for the caret in the editor to work correctly. Any way that is easily possible? I do not see a hook for that. Also is there a method for getting the window's z-index, I might be missing it. It looks like there is a getNextZindex but that is hidden inside the scope of Windows.js\n. @andersevenrud I already have a window showing up with the editor, I am setting up the toolbar at the moment. Thanks for all your help.\n. Yea, I have been using Writer as a reference, since it has a toolbar. Other than that setting up the application is pretty straightforward. I plan on requesting pull requests on your code once I am done doing this with more documentation in the code.\n. @andersevenrud What would you think of being added as a collaborator on Poe? As the readme says I am going to be gone for a few months and I would like for someone to be able to accept pull requests and what not in the event someone does help out, instead of thinking the project is completely dead\n. @andersevenrud Thanks :)\n. @andersevenrud First what is the directory structure? Is API intended to be 'subclassed' or is it more on the procedural level, and is there a client and server implementation of each api?\n. @andersevenrud I would really love to get started working on the project. (I actually just started basically the same thing until I found this)\n. @andersevenrud Thanks! I am looking over the code now, if I have any questions I'll ask. I might have a few :smile: \n. @andersevenrud What is the primary goal of OS.js? Is it to be interfaced with virtual machine, just use the user's dropbox, drive, etc, a desktop environment for X11 or even all of the above?\n. @andersevenrud That is pretty amazing. I plan on helping as much as I can, but starting January 20th I will be unable to access a computer for a minimum of two months, but I will come back. This is something I have wanted to do for a while now.\n. @andersevenrud What are you thoughts on a toolbar dropdown? I do not see one. The only thing is see that might be a problem is that toolbar.js just handles an object of (title, icon, and toggleable) and puts them in a ul then hooks up the event callbacks. It looks to me that if toolbar handled objects of the prototype OSjs.GUI._Input the toolbar would be more versatile and abstract away the DOM a little better. Thoughts?\n. I see. Thank you. I need to look a little harder :smile:\n. @andersevenrud Not a problem. The documentation is a little of a throw off. My question is what doc generator do you use or want to use on the project (for when I start trying to help add some more documentation)?\n. @andersevenrud I just looked and I am really not impressed with any either. Poe uses codo, very simple and crude but effective, but it is only for coffeescript.\n. @andersevenrud Yea I know. Thanks anyway\n. Is GUI.Select meant to not show the currently selected value? Even with an option having the \"selected\" attribute it does not show any value.\n. No value is show.  I mean using Select.setValue() it doesn't show any value, and then if I use web inspector to set one of the options as selected it doesn't show either. Select.setValue() would be nice if it returned a boolean value also.\n. Yes,\n@fontSelect = new OSjs.GUI.Select(\"FontSelect\", {onChange: @fontSelectClicked});\nfor (font in OSjs.API.getHandlerInstance().getConfig('Fonts').list)\n        @fontSelect.addItem(font, font);\n@fontSelect.setValue(OSjs.API.getHandlerInstance().getConfig('Fonts')['default']);\n. I have that. I just omitted it. It is in the DOM, it is in the picture. And toolbar.render() is called before even the loop that adds the items.\n. Yes options are there, that is why I tried to set the selected attribute on one of them. Im puzzled\n. Link to my source\n. I wondered about that :) Good that it is all figured out.\n. Yea that would work.\n. Got ya. I was kind of wondering why you would need a reference to the toolbar haha\n. It happens\n. I think that would work out better. It is always a good idea to have each class in its own file. The helper functions in OSjs.API namespace and renaming gui.js. Also it would also be a good idea to divide the API into more namespaces. The process helpers like launch, kill, getProcess, getProcesses etc. could be in API.Process and so on and so forth.\n. Sounds great to me. Also maybe provide an api directory inside javascript. Then say for OSjs.GUI provide src/javascript/API/gui.js which would hold all OSjs.GUI.* functions\nThat way they are easy to relate from the loaded scripts e.g. using developer tools and the source code.\n. That sounds good also. \n. @andersevenrud Aye, Aye. This still however makes a lot of settings being handled by the application itself. Looking at it from the point of an application developer for the platform, they would still have to manage a _settings object and build the tree like in CoreWM.saveSettings. It would be great if UserSettings would be more like\n_settings = new UserSettings('MyStoragePool');\n_settings.load(callback);\n_settings.get('settingName');\n_settings.set('settingName', value);\n_settings.getAll(); // Something like that to just get an object containing everything\n_settings.save(callback);\nThe loading and saving would allow for AJAX and the developer for the platform would not have to worry about the details of interfacing with it. They would just have to create the object and save whenever they need to.\n. Possibly even an event handler to notify when a certain setting has changed, in case the settings could change through say the System > Settings dialog. There could be a SettingsManager that it interfaces with. It would actually hold all of the settings needed and be a buffer between the client and server. That way if settings for it change in another location on the system the applications can know about it.\n. Basically it is completely singleton. UserSettings would just talk to SettingsManager, who would actually have the settings in one location to keep data usage low. The singleton would then be SettingsManager and UserSettings is used just to abstract away the details. The code feels like you are controlling your settings in the application without having all of the 'MyStoragePool' everywhere, while still being a singleton. You would tell UserSettings about 'MyStoragePool' and it just accesses the singleton for you. Hopefully that is a little more clear :smile: \n. It can have the best of both worlds. A simple singleton like interface with the SettingsManager for the core and basically a wrapper around that so application developers don't have to keep saying where they are storing it any time they want to get or set a setting. It will make it easier for newcomers to the project who wan't to write an application for the platform.\nSo like\nSettingsManager  -- Basically the same thing as before, the primary place for settings to be stored\nSettings -- For the core API to access things individually (your singleton interface)\nApplicationSettings -- To make the app developers life easier. A wrapper around Settings that would store the pool name.\nMe personally if I found a system where I had to tell a function every time where the settings were stored when I got a value or set one, I would just write the wrapper myself. It would eventually end up everyone having their own wrapper for their application to access settings. Thats something simple that might turn developers away from the project, and if not then you would end up with who knows how many megabytes just of the same wrapper around settings.\n. I like that Idea. It honestly would work out great, and not cause the developer to have to look around for a second settings class.\n. Thats great! I actually really do love the .instance proxy. You made my day.\nI think I could learn a thing or two from you :+1: \n. What does the 'EventBindingcheckbox imply? Like events for when settings change outside of the scope of the application to allow for system settings?\n. I'll get on it.\n. Right now I am going on the assumption that not all PanelItem subclasses will need settings. So I am leaving it out of the base PanelItem class. If someone would like to have settings for their custom PanelItem then they can just accept a settings object on construction. If not the constructor will have no arguments passed in.\n. I can't get it to register the new file. I added it to 200-compile.json\nThe only way it loads is if I compile.\n. I am having some problems with the PanelItem settings stuff. And I know this isn't the right place for this information but I have the code pushed. I am getting a random circular dependency in the setting dialog from the \"CoreWM\" pool. Here is a link maybe you can see something I'm not? https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/compare/master...RyanRiffle:PanelItem_Settings\n. I found the problem. It comes down to windowmanager.js:491\nIt gave null for the key name and my SettingsFragment.set() just wasn't ready for it. However I do have the problem of the save feature. The SettingsFragment has no idea what pool it's in so it can't tell the SettingsManager to save that pool.\n. Sorry I know the commits are a mess. The merge was to make sure no changes you made while I was working on it would conflict with what I was doing. If there is a better way to handle that please let me know. I wanted to test everything and make sure it works before I requested a pull.\n. Not a problem.\n. I need to get a linter :smile: \n. I wasn't doing anything in PanelItem itself just because I figured not all panel items would need settings but that works well too :smile:\n. Alright Ill just view the diff to get an update.\n. Yes that makes sense. If I may ask, what was the numbers/booleans thing needed for?\n. I understand now. We can close this\n. Like changing one setting for a PanelItem changes resets the whole pool?\n. If you know what's causing it then I don't see why not. If not I can figure it out, I'm off work now.\n. Just curious but issue #221 is closed. Should this still be on here?\n. IIRC most browsers ignore focus if youevt.preventDefault()themousedownevent. If that doesn't work, it's been a while since I have worked on a web based application, couldn't you justpreventDefaulton thefocus` event?\n. No problem\n. ",
    "MrSchism": "I'm looking forward to this being flushed out because I just went to fix a minor typographical error and couldn't even find the element it's in (or the bug itself) in source.\nThe error, by the way, is on the GUITest > DnD screen where it says \"Drag and drop [an] element\"\n. Noted and fixed in a PR. (andersevenrud/OS.js-v2-expermiments#1)\n. I'll try to source some native translators.\nI may have some translators for the following locales:\n[hi] [es-pr] [zh-hk]\n.

I'm sure I'll be able to find someone).  As for the zh-hk, I have relatives and friends who speak Chinese.\nI'm hoping to get some replies on or around Tuesday of next week.\n. I'm having an issue with my hindi friends; spanish is the opposite.  I'm trying to find the best translation for spanish. Chinese seems to have hit an impasse.\n. I think there needs to be some discussion about where you want to go with Writer, Music Player and File Manager.\nWriter\nWhat sort of improvements do you want in regards to the UI?  What sort of additional features would you like to see?\nMusic Player\nWhat sort of UI issues are you thinking of fixing up?\n. @rlamana made a great HTML5/CSS/JS window manager called Ventus.  He also made a nifty project called \"Terminusjs\") which might be worth taking a gander at.\nTerminus could probably work really well with OS.js\n. Which other ones were you looking at?\nPersonally, I'd be happy with an extremely limited set of commands.  Too many commands... or too much complexity in the commands... could potentially slow the system and/or potentially increase security concerns.\n. @jpreston86 care to take this or find someone who might be interested?\n. I think offering a few server options might be best in the long-term.\n. > @christopherdumas Some people are already running LAMP servers and don't want to set up a separate application server for a Python backend. These people would probably prefer the PHP backend. The same argument could be made for any backend.\n\nI agree that the project shouldn't try to provide all possible backends but perhaps the 2-3 most common. In that regard I think Python has a larger user base than Node.js. I'm also already running Python applications so I would prefer a Python backend. This is why I personally would like to see one.\nI don't think we should get rid of the PHP backend. After Python and Ruby on Rails I think PHP is still widely used.\n\nTo touch on this subject, I think it'd be stupid to get rid of the PHP backend because it's there and works.  That could function as a reference implementation of sorts.\nAs for other backends, Python and Ruby are both good, but Node is gaining ground insanely fast.  That being said, we shouldn't just be looking at current, but future implementations and I think Node is probably going to be more desirable in the long run than the PHP and possibly even the Rails version... and I say that with a deep love of Ruby.\n. Guess my other post didn't stick.\nI was going to suggest cannibalizing parts of Etherpad, but this fits the use case far better.\nI'm going to fiddle with Poe a bit.  There are a few features I'm going to attempt to add/fix (No promises; my JS skills aren't great).\n. Depending on how it goes (I'm just now picking up coffeescript), I may try to translate parts of it to js.  I've got a new term of courses starting on the 12th and I'll probably need something to do while sitting around on campus.\n. I like it!\nWe should change the toolbox icon in/on the panel to be the \"gem\" of the logo.\n. Maybe wrap it in a cream circle... or make the logo off-white with a bar-colored circle.  That way, if someone makes the panel transparent or white, it still shows.\nMaybe we should look into updating it's color with the theme... or bar color?\n. I'll give this a run through the ringer tonight.  If I can spot an issue with it, I'll open an issue.  Might be worth trying with gremlins.js\n. Could not reproduce the memory leak.\n. From #100: We can use the slide deck 'dzslides' to create slides (Presentation).  We just need a javascript text editor that produces HTML.  A good example of this is the blackboard education platform.\n\nIt uses this UI to create HTML formatted written content in a WYSIWYG editor.  TinyMCE is LGPL'd, so that could be used until we find a need to use something with a different license.\n. As an American, I can say that you both compose more reasonable sentences than many, many Americans.\nThis isn't the first time I've seen 'togethere' used... this is just more forgivable than a US college student doing it.\n. It's not working on the demo yet... but the demo looks brilliant.\n. I stand corrected.  It's there, but not by default on my device.  I enabled it and it works.  Mea culpa.\nOn an aside, the arrow (and subsequently the menu) should come down a bit.  We may want add this to the documentation as optional.\n. Yeah, center and a bit lower (as to show most of the emblem) would probably look best.  We can screw around with this setting as much as needed.\n. We could move the opacity slider into the color selector for the panel to give some more room on the main settings page.  \nFrom there, we could either put a settings button next to the Panel Items box where you can select fonts OR you could add a box for button font colors with a checkbox in it for \"dynamic font contrast\" (or something to that effect) to allow it to automatically contrast.\n. Looking at what we've got going here as compared to other, similar settings, splitting the Panels tab into two should work.  You could do a total overhaul if you'd like, but for now we can go simple and use the simpler version as a baseline from which to create the new UI.\nThe overhaul would take a while to produce and release.\nPersonally, I don't think an overhaul would be needed, but a unified settings screen like Xubuntu might be worth looking at due to how touch-friendly it appears to be; I'm a desktop user, so the settings are nice as-is.\n. Awesome!\n. I do like our current settings, but the following should be considered:\nSome of buttons aren't exactly easy to use on a touch interface.  Maybe a toggle to switch it to a touch-based interface would be beneficial. Going all-touch got Windows and Ubuntu into some hot water; it's best to learn from that.\nWe might be able to cannibalize from the settings page in Xubuntu.  It organizes settings into separate pages that can be returned from with ease.  It's also more touch friendly than the current settings, but is \"desktop\" enough to be usable with mouse.\n. Have all of the settings down the side, tabs in the main window?  That could work.\n. Yes!\n. I assume that you mean to toggle between desktop and touch?\n. I'd like to see an 8-directional snap.  Drag to corner to take up the corner, drag to side (or top/bottom) to take up that half of screen.\nThat way, apps could take half or a quarter of the screen.\n. Not sure if it's desired behavior, but on Firefox 34.0.5, it doesn't snap to corner, but it just stops during the drag towards the corner.  It's definitely an improvement, though.\nI tried on Chrome (40.0.2214.93) and encountered what may be a bug (I couldn't move windows at all).  I'll be checking again in a bit; this is a campus computer I'm using.\n. I'm not using a device emulator; I just opened it up in Chrome browser and it wouldn't move.  The window seemed to gray out like I clicked a background object, but the text in the window highlighted (settings, specifically).\n. Much better.\n. The Ghost CMS team experienced some issues with FlexBoxes on Firefox recently.  It may be worth checking back a version or two.\n. It looks awesome!\nWhat's the OS/WM for the first original screenshot, @PewienTyp ?\n. There's a strange bug on this theme...I'm opening another issue to report it.\n. If you hit enter, it does spit a bug.\nTypeError: undefined is not a function\nat FileDialog.onInputEnter (http://osjsv2.0o.no/osjs.js:13380:10)\nat $input._addGUIElement.OSjs.GUI.Text.onKeyPress (http://osjsv2.0o.no/osjs.js:13114:16)\nat HTMLInputElement.<anonymous> (http://osjsv2.0o.no/osjs.js:9508:27)\nYou can save by clicking.\n. Honestly, if you were busy, I probably would have fixed it myself later this evening.\n. Maybe a \"DeepFreeze\" mode where it's wiped on logout and instate some sort of demo login?\n. Okay, so a wipe every X days might work well, but then you have to consider some of the issues anonymous FTP systems have encountered in the past... including the potential sharing of illegal files.\nI figured login pages might be an issue.\nNightly wiping may be too quick.  Automatic deletion after 3 days, maybe?\nRegarding \"DeepFreeze\", check this page for details\n. The way I'm reading that means that a file could be kept alive indefinitely by simply modifying it every few hours.\nAlso, for clarity, did you mean keep files that \"are x hours\" old, or \"are less than x hours old\"?  Otherwise, it would mean that only the first few people would be able to create a file without it spontaneously dying.\n. Yeah, I think 24-72 hours old would be more than enough time to show something to someone.\nIf you/we work on a way of automatically cleaning up from within OS.js, adding an \"admin scripts\" or \"scheduled tasks\" page to the non-demo version's \"settings\" page might be useful.\nThat way, anyone running this could select what directory to cull and how frequently the culling would occur.\nAlso, I'm not seeing a file creation date/time in the information of files created.  Want me to open a ticket?\n. Alrighty.  I'll be opening a ticket here in a moment.\nYeah, essentially I was thinking of an interface to schedule and manage cron jobs for people who might need a GUI-only experience.  I'll throw together a mockup.\n. I was experiencing the same thing.  I've been working on it slowly (after the initial attempt in early March), but never got anywhere.\n. Did you ever get the scheduled-task/cron job maker taken care of?\nWe could do it every six hours or every day.\ncron job for this would be either:\n0 */6 * * * /path/to/cleanup.sh (six hours)\nOR\n0 0 * * * /path/to/cleanup.sh (daily - server midnight)\ncleanup.sh:\nbash\ncd ./vfs/\nrm -rf ./{public,home/demo}/*\ncleanup.sh would need to be put in the base location where /vfs is.  We can adjust the script as necessary.\nNot sure if we could do a pure .js version, but that may be more nifty.\n. The blacklist filter to remove naughty stuff only removes things named inappropriately.\nA file named Stenographer could be a stock image of a court reporter... or of a slutty stenographer.  Name is totally mundane, though.  I think the only way to be sure is a blanket clean.\nUsing find with an mtime to wipe things 24 hours(ish) would require a more frequent poll than a flat daily run.\n. You might also want to remove the contents of /home.  People have used that similarly before.\n. True, until you get to directories holding shared resources (typically music or video, but occasionally documents).\nI think that the third option is probably best.\nOn an aside, sometimes saved files are seen as having a MIME type of \"undefined\" after saving.\n. Regarding the Undefined MIMEtype, it happened on step 4 occasionally, in either home or shared.\nRegarding the shared folder, if we get a lock set up, it should resolve the issue entirely.  Better to have a functional feature people might not need than a broken one people might want.\n. I just had a crazy idea.  I know it's possible but probably unlikely.\nWhy not just use a separate public repo for the store itself and have each directory in the repo's primary folder be its own package?\nLike andersevenrud/OSstore/packages/{package1,package2,package3,...} or even\nandersevenrud/OSstore/v2/packages/{package1,package2,package3,...} (to futureproof the repo a bit).\nThat way the repo page can have a clean, accessible landing page (readme.md) and a single file (per version supported in the store) which would contain the list of every package in the /packages directory.  This file could be removed, but it would create a lot of strain every time the Store loads... because it would have to scrape every folder in the package directory.\nThen it'd be a matter of getting it from the git repo.  You could either do raw files or fetch using git (from either the underlying OS or using a git-js library).\n. You're understanding me spot on.  I wasn't certain how it worked exactly.  I was more or less suggesting the following:\n1. Move the store to its own repository\n2. Make a directory in the repository for every store-aware version of OS.js (so v2 onward).\n3. Add a manifest in the version's directory.\n4. Have the store app parse the manifest.\nSo, does the underlying OS do the git fetch or do you use a javascript library to grab it?\n. Looks like I should weigh in here (sorry about going dark).\nAs for a dock, that might be nice, but I'd put that really low on priority.  You can move the current panel to the bottom to replicate the traditional desktop paradigm.\nRegarding a slideshow, I'd like to see a front end developed for dzslides (which would probably be easiest to implement in os.js).\n. When it comes to slide decks, dzslides is probably the easiest to use and implement.  Issue is it would require an editor.  Shouldn't be hard because each slide is a section in a single HTML file.  Should just have to insert tags and render everything inside those tags in the javascript editor.\nI know that's how things like the blackboard educational system works:\n\n. Prezzi is a paid slide deck; impress.js is a free alternative, but complicated.  DZSlides is free and single file.  The editor above could probably be recreated easily and new slides just have to have a  tag put in.  Might be a minimal side job, but shouldn't be impossible.\n. Alrighty.  I was just going to run a pull request.  I was waiting for input on #102 before hand, though.\nTwo birds with one pull and whatnot.\n. I'm not seeing that; I'm seeing result.userData on line 99.\n. Since JavaScript isn't my strongest language (that's actually why I took an interest in this; best way to learn is to dive in: sink or swim) does that change it to being okay or does the line still need to be changed?\n. From what I can tell, the Node server is still very much an unstable work-in-progress.\n@andersevenrud should this bit of code be changed or is it more of a server issue?\n. Installing to Other would work, but only if the category could be changed and the menu would reflect it without a session restart.\nFor it to install into a new category, that would require the categories to be populated from a survey of all listed categories in packages.  This might not be the best way because a maintainer may change the name of a category; giving that arbitrary control of your install to a bunch of people (package developers) might not be in the best interest of the end user.  If a package doesn't fall into a system defined category, it should be placed in 'other' unless the user (or admin, depending on the use case) defines a new category manually.\n. > Do you mean replacing the label with \"Other\" instead of \"Unknown\" ? It might be prettier\nAnd more reasonable.  Either 'Other' or 'Misc.' would be a better option.\n. No worries.  Looking over it, if I didn't change that, I'd have had to change the name of the icon and references to it elsewhere because the icon itself was referred to as applications-other.png\n. With the emails I get from ValveSoftware, i3, and PhotonStorm, it's impossible to call this stuff 'spam'.\nI saw what you changed after and realized where I screwed up; thanks for catching that.\n. I think a system resource panel would be single handedly the best, especially if you can see usage per user in a separate tab\nSimple, like Virtual Machine Manager's interface... but instead of VMs, show users.\n\n. Any 'user' accounts on a system.  Like field 2 of top.\nOR alternatively, if used in a multi-user mode, any logged-in users.\n. In the first instance, the underlying system.\nIn the second, OS.js.  It'd ideally be set for only an elevated user to see.\n. It wouldn't be a bad idea.  The ability for an admin/mod/op to monitor is always good, in my book.\n. That'd be awesome.  I was thinking something between the monitor I linked above and conky\n. I say between the two because while conky is nice, it might be offputting to casual and new moderators/administrators.\n. Essentially, set up OS.js entirely within the virtual machine so all a developer has to do is download the VM and run it and they have instant access to their own, functional OS.js environment.  I suggested the one above because it doesn't require installation or admin rights on the host OS (which is why I've been spending some time on it).\n. Exactly...Well, this does too... the distro is just 9mb. This is downloaded and requires zero installation or configuration on the host OS... and no admin requirements.\nLiterally just download or clone (if you clone, copy to another directory).  It'd make testing packages faster for a few people.  Trick will be setting up git/gitignore to leave the host and only dev OSjs.\n. During setup, while following the manual install method:\ntc@box:~/OS.js-v2-master$ ./bin/start-node-dist.sh\nmodule.js:338\n    throw err;\n          ^\nError: Cannot find module 'node-fs-extra'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:336:15)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:278:25)\n    at Module.require (module.js:365:17)\n    at require (module.js:384:17)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/tc/OS.js-v2-master/src/server-node/server.js:36\n1:3)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:460:26)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:478:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:501:10)\nI'm going to spin up another VM and just try the automatic install script and see how it goes.\n. I'll be giving it another shot later this evening while documenting what I do in a step-by-step process.\n. I was giving it a shot, but not getting anywhere.  I think the qemu was suffering major performance issues.  It locked up installing, but I was on my netbook.  I'll try again on my desktop and see how it goes.\n. I'm unbelievably stoked about this, to be honest.\n. It'll also streamline and focus development.\n. I generally share your dislike of jQuery, but I get the necessity of it (or something like it) to make larger projects... simpler (I guess).  I do like chainable methods, to a degree.  It can make the syntax more reasonable to read in some cases or more convoluted.\nThe fact that there're only four methods to deal with makes this totally okay with me, especially because it makes the project more accessible. \n. I think it's ready.\n. Putting a filter on will just result in people bypassing names.  Most of what was in /shared/porn was random character files.\nI still think a cron-job to clear the folder every night would be a good idea.\n. It was discussed on #85.\n. @andersevenrud What about the /home folder?\n. I'm unable to reproduce.  Moreover, the behavior that plugin describes doesn't seem to differ from my default Firefox behavior.\nCan you elaborate on what exactly it's supposed to as opposed to the default behavior?

The only problem is that the spec is changing with each GTK release, so if we create a library it won't be compatible with older/newer versions of Broadway.\nI would like to help, would it be a good idea to create a github repo for this library?\nThanks :-)\n. (If you need docs about Broadway, there is a wiki page about it in Symbiose: https://github.com/symbiose/symbiose/wiki/Broadway)\n. Seems good to me :-)\nI was wondering, what about the server-side code? The user will be able to launch apps remotely? I already tried to emulate a GTK environment \n. But it does not work well.\n.

    "eraffaelli": "I'm working on a fr_FR version for the packages. I'll contact you and PR when done.\n. A little feature suggestion, to be all to set window on the left or right (or more like W10) like it's possible on Windows since 7 named Windows Snap. Maybe with keyboard shortcut.\nEdit : Reading tioteath comment once again, so what is planned is also like what I suggest?\n. Ok thanks I didn't know what this setting was.\n. Totally need this ^^\nI'm working on a Weather app (well, it's more a playground for now but) and it would be nice to have a \"favorite\" city widget.\n. I will be able to test it (I have win10) so maybe I can make feedback once available ;)\n. I've try for two or three minutes on mobile but it's not responsive so... xD\nI'll try this weekend on desktop\n. I've tried it but I didn't see anything wrong with what I do. Sorry if this doesn't help you much :/\n. I don't know if this is possible but we could make an effect that blowing up the whole window.\nOr the same with a black hole.\n. Sorry I screw up all ^^'\nFYI, I have included the it_IT translation in my PR as well with the reorder.\n. Not really but to avoid conflict with this PR for my reorder, I have included @Kirkhammetz translation. He deserve the credit for the IT translation ;)\n. FR only. I've added the IT translation of this PR in mine because I was working on reorder when this PR come up.\nI should have waited the commit before reordering.\nSorry for the confusion :/\n. Sorry :/\n. Sorry, I just read again the translation note and see...\n\nSimply fill out the objects in top of file\n. You're welcome ;)\n. Well, the way to do it doesn't really matter ^^ It was just an understanding example that I know.\nBut in many languages the way to write words need that count, so it would be nice to have it.\n\nYou want to put that example in the locales.js files? Or in the \"main\" files and the locales doesn't change?\nBecause if we change that, all related translation will need an upgrade.\n. Sorry, I forgot to add them (I hate when I don't have them ><)\n. I'm on it.\nI don't use space but mine haves 4 spaces.\nI correct and I commit after.\n. What were you doing when this occurred?\nFrom what I can read, you were in settings, but did you do something specific?\n. ",

Ehi don't worry no problem, maybe next time :D I'm glad to help, let me know if there are some new packages/core to translate :)\n. @andersevenrud Sure! I'm going to give it a look this weekend\n. I didn't know, I'm checking how to for the time :)\n. I was thinking of resetting a couple of hour ago because of it, let's close this pr then, I'll make the reset when I have some spare time in the next days :)\n. Yea I know sorry, I've been really busy at work, I'm going to take sometimes tonight to do it or it'll take forever!\n. Sure I'll give them a look! \ud83d\udc4d \nOn a side note, I tried to get the missing ones through the object keys but the browser doesn't expose OSjs as global, it gave me undefined didn't have time to dig deeper, am I missing something?\n.

It is a Strategy wrapper for passport intended to auto-generate a secure key-wallet regardless of the login and session Strategy used by the app.\nI hope to get it working at least for the local strategy within a couple of weeks. Then, if a miracle happens, I'll be able to make a general wrapper.\nDespite I've been working in security for a couple of years, I'm not a security expert (my work has always been supervised by one), so any comment is welcome.\n. I like the word togethere. Never correct it. It's together, and it's there... That just convinced me :+1: \n. Well, I'm Spanish, I live in France, and I've never spoken (nor written) a decent English. So I clearly write English using the empirical method... According to my uncle (who is from Yorkshire) I happen to speak English with an annoying French accent that I hadn't before... he finds it amusing \n. Sure ! I just have to find the files :-p\n.

Just updated my comment above with the current missing language strings.\n. @andersevenrud: Just updated my comment above.\n. @andersevenrud, sorry for the waiting. Updated the list, nice work with the new implementations.\n. Updated missing strings list for #508 \n. True, I just started installing bcrypt as I though the documentation meant bcrypt instead of brypt. But however it told me that bcryptjs was missing.\nI guess it only requires bcryptjs, will however test it later and let you know.\n. Only bcryptjs is required for this to work.\n. Done #332 \n. I have made a fix for most of those calculator issues at #489.\nHowever, is the issue with the keyboard on touch devices still a problem @mcky?\n. How about something like this, including an option to add (or remove) setting groups.\n\nSo then an application can put it's own settings in there.\n. @anderssevenrud: Look good, keep on the good work.\nHow will it look once you go into a setting group?\nHave you decided that yet?\n. I don't think that there is a correct way to do for all of them since the content of them would be different.\nLike those (taken from my Macbook Pro)\nDesktop Settings (Select background and such)\n\nGeneral Settings (Here OS.js could have general settings, like Show File Extensions and Sounds)\n\nLanguage and Locales (Select Language)\n\n. @andersevenrud: It's gonna be nice.\n. \ud83d\udc4d Let me know if you see something not right.\n. Without __DIR__ it uses the relative path from the indexed PHP-file.\nWhich means that if the indexed PHP-file is api.php, then it will workout fine.\nBut if that is not the case it will use a wrong path.\nI noticed this since that I use a PHP based service (Valet) to handle local domains (like http://osjs.dev) which I use for development.\nIn this case the indexed PHP-file is inside Valet, and then it requires the api.php-file if the uri matches.\nIf you wanna test it out yourself, you can install Valet and then add my OsjsValetDriver.php to Valet.\n. I will look through an see if there are other cases like this.\nWill be back.\n. @andersevenrud: It doesn't seems to be a case anywhere else.\n. Nice \ud83d\udc4d \n.

    "filips123": "@andersevenrud I can translate to Slovenian.\nWhat should be translated in v3?. @andersevenrud I created PRs os-js/osjs-client#18 and os-js/osjs-panels#6. I will translate other application and themes later.. I created few more PRs (os-js/osjs-client#26, os-js/osjs-freedesktop-sounds#2, os-js/osjs-gnome-icons#2, os-js/osjs-standard-dark-theme#2, os-js/osjs-standard-theme#4). I will translate applications later when they become almost finished because they could maybe be changed until stable v3.\nYou should remove milestone 2.2.0 from this issue \ud83d\ude03.. You should post message every time when it is need to translate new thing.. Maybe it will be better to use some localisation platform (eg. Transifex, Crowding...) instead of just files that are edited. It will be easier to track for changes and untranslated strings . It looks like there is some error with automated translation updates. I translated metadata in some packages (osjs-freedesktop-sounds, osjs-gnome-icons, osjs-standard-dark-theme, osjs-standard-theme), but it says that sl_SI translation is missing.. What about some localisation platform? It would be easier to track for changes and untranslated strings.. There are some free options (with some limitations) available.\nBoth Transifex and and Crowdin have some free plan for open source projects. I know and use both but I don't know which would be the best. Transifex has organizations feature so it may be better for large projects.\nThere are also some other products available.. @BoFFire Yes, I just only said which I know best \ud83d\ude01. Weblate can also be good.. I think you should use some standard and portable format, maybe JSON because it probably won't be hard to convert JS to it.\nYou should use some format that supports custom plurals (and not just zero, one and more) because some languages (eg. Slovenian) use very complicated ways for plural. It should probably support something like CLDR.\nYou could probably use JSON i18next files.. I think it would be OK for now but in the future it could be hard to implement this for all pluralisation rules for all languages CLDR.\nMaybe you could find some lightweight i18next compatibile library or build your own \ud83e\udd14. @andersevenrud For your interface, you should show progress bar for each language separately and table with missing keys should also be separate for each language. This is because translators probably won't care for other translations and their status. This could maybe be done with some tabs or tables.\nThere should also be link for each missing key to it's original in English (example). This would help translators to find where is that key and what should be it's value.. @andersevenrud I saw that you updated UI for translations. It is OK but I have few suggestions.\n\nKeys are displayed in table with columns \"Key\", \"Translation\". What is this \"Translation\" column. If i is for adding translations, it should probably not be there because translations should be added with editing files (editing from UI would probably be very hard to implement). Also, there sould be column \"Original\" with link to original translation in English or even direct value of it.\n\nKeys are now seperated between languges. This is good, but it is still not so easy to navigate between them.\nI think that page should be seperated into tabs (example of tabs).\nFirst tab could be \"Overview\" and it could show overview of translations for all package. So for each package, there should be progress bar to show translations for whole package and additional progress bars for each package (like in current UI version). Keys should not be displayed.\nFor each language, there should be tab with language name. There should be progress bar for translation status of all packages. And then, the translation status should be displayed for each package (like in current UI version but only for one language). It should display package name, progress bar and missing keys with liks to original English value.\n\nIf possible, languages should be named like \"Language name (language-code)\". You could use some libraries that convert code to name if they aren't so heavy. Maybe you could also do your library or even don't display language name.\n\nThere are some libraries for localisation (also for language naming, pluralisation, numbering, displaying dates) but they are probably very heavy. Maybe you can look to some of them and \"extract\" only functions that are needed here.. @andersevenrud I'm not familiar with HyperApp but I will try to do something :) Maybe I could also help you with designing backend for the interface. Maybe it could be just client side JavaScript so it could be hosted on GitHub pages.. ### I have some ideas:\n- What about some web browser. (I don't know if this is possible and this is just an idea. I found project - https://github.com/browserhtml/browserhtml, but I don't know how it works and it is experimental.)\n- Also, add some mail client and MS Office like programs.\n- In the top bar, show icon instead of text \"Menu\", like in v2.\n- Windows name could be at center of the window, like in v2.\nAlso, there are some bugs:\n\nSome apps, like Calculator, don't have icons in the menu. Intend, they have OS.js icon.\nTab key don't work in text editors.\nRight click doesn't work. It doesn't do anything.\nWhen I move window around, the title text of window is selected. Also, mouse cursor is changed to moving cursor.\nWindow names in top bar are cropped.\nThe icons in the window are too close together and they are overlapping.\nResizing window doesn't work.\nFile manager doesn't work. It opens alert with text \"TypeError: HEAD or GET Request cannot have a body.\".\nMaybe there are also some other bugs. Also, some features and functionalities from v2 don't work in v3.\n\nScreenshots\nSelected title text while moving:\n\nMoving cursor:\n\nCropped window names:\n\nOverlapping icons:\n\nFile Manager:\n\n. What about Docker image and CI integration? There was Dockerfile in v2.\nAlso, what about other cloud storage adapters like OneDrive, Dropbox, Box...\nWill there be build with all applications, providers and adapters included?\nAlso, could you make online v3 demo?. > I can provide a docker setup, sure. The procedure is basically the steps mentioned in the installation documentation, but having a set of docker-compose configurations might be handy (to pick if you want auth by default for example). What would you want to see ?\nThere should be something like in v2. And there should be support to install and set up other themes, adapters and providers.\nYou should also include support for Vagrant.\n\nI could possibly provide a CLI command to make a \"default setup\" with a selection of packages, etc. What do you think ?\n\nYes, you should create command to build and install default packages. Maybe something like npm install && npm run build:default?\nWill standalone builds builds and webhosts (https://manual.os-js.org/installation/) be supported in v3?\n\nAlso, will older v2 apps be compatible with v3 (or opposite)? What should developers do to make their v2 apps compatible with v3? Could you make upgrade guide or something like this?. I just want to remind you that some of my bugs are still not resolved. Some of those bugs were already resolved, but there is still a problem. I also include some new suggestions and bugs.\nSuggestions:\n\n\nWhat about some web browser.\nAlso, add some mail client and MS Office like programs.\nWindows name could be at center of the window, like in v2.\n\n\n\nAdd settings application.\nAdd support for creating files and folders on desktop.\nYou should add eraser to Draw application.\nWhat about search bar and process manager?\nThere could be user switcher and support to use different login adapters at same time.\nWhat about some command line?\nWhat about games?\nAdd button for full screen mode.\n\nBugs:\n\n\nSome apps, like Calculator, don't have icons in the menu. Intend, they have OS.js icon.\nRight click doesn't work. It doesn't do anything.\nWhen I move window around, the title text of window is selected. Also, some of text labels in applications are also selected.\nWindow names in top bar are cropped. They should be cropped only if there is no enough space.\nResizing window doesn't work. It should in all directions.\n\n\n\nCalculator application incorrectly displays that 3 + 3 * 3 = 18. It is 3 + 3 * 3 = 3 + (3 * 3) = 12.\nApplication titles and labels are sometimes selected.\nCanvas in Draw application should be also resized with dragging it.\nWhen opening the OS.js, login page is shown for about 0.25 seconds even if there is no custom login adapter installed.\nAlso, there is an error while installing themes and applications. See #688.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhere are files from File Manager stored? Can they be accessed by hosting OS?\n\nScreenshots:\nSelected title text while moving:\n\nCropped window names:\n\nSelected text labels:\n. > > Right click doesn't work. It doesn't do anything.\n\nI don't know what exactly you expect it to do....\n\nIt should open context menu depending on content that was clicked. Like in real OS and Os.js v2.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I move window around, the title text of window is selected. Also, some of text labels in applications are also selected.\nApplication titles and labels are sometimes selected.\n\nI actually can't reproduce this on my machines. I'll maybe have a look at some other setups. Are you sure your theme and dependencies are up to date ? Also, maybe there are just spesific spots this triggers ? If so, some more info would be appreciated.\n\nI currently can't test this on my local machine, so I am using Codenvy.io workspace using Node.js stack. I have Git v2.1.4, Node.js v8.11.1 and NPM v6.2.0 installed.\nI've made completely fresh installation of OS.js v3. I've also installed standard theme and example application.\nI've tested this with different browsers on Windows 10. On Chrome, it works normally (no text is selected). On Firefox and Edge, text is selected. On OS.js v2, this worked in all browsers.\nI think the problem is user-select. On Edge and Firefox, it requires prefix. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select.\n\nAlso, will there be support for choosing application to open file, like in v2?\n\n\nAlso, what about support for icons and files on desktop?\n. > Also a new @osjs/standard-theme build to center the window title ;)\nMaybe this could be in settings so users could configure this.\nAlso, maybe you could also support icons on the left and Windows-style icons. This should be in settings.. > Not sure what you mean by \"icons on the left\" and \"widows style icons\".\nWith \"icons on the left\" I meant that the window icons would be on the left side of window. Currently, they are on the right.\n\nWith \"widows style icons\" I meant icons that are on Windows. \n\n. There could also be support for panel at the bottom or other sides.. What about ISO disk image, so OS.js could be installed like a real OS? This could be disk image with modified Linux that's launches the browser and opens the OS.js?. What about some installation program which will run on first startup, so users could setup some settings like username, password, language, timezone... Developers of custom apps, providers, adapters or distributions will also be able to set up some required settings. This could be optional.. Is it possible to host client and server on different computers?\nAlso, is it possible to host client on GitHub Pages and server on Heroku? . It looks good, but it still lacks some features and design of v2. Some apps are still very basic and with poor design.\nWill there be support for fullscreen mode and icons on desktop? What about touch menu or some mobile OS like theme?. Yes I mean visually \ud83d\ude0a.  Unfortunately I can not help you because I'm not expert in Node.js and related things.. How often will you update online demo? Some things are outdated and not fixed even you fixed them last week.. I have concerns about pinned issues for static announcements (like #705) or long discussions (like #18). They are not intended to be used for that.\nFor static announcements, you should create file in repository (probably in docs directory) or GitHub Gist, and maybe link it from website or readme.\nFor long discussions, you should create GitHub Teams in organization that allows organizing members and and are also good for discussions. You could create team Admins, Developers, Translators... and relevant discussion will be placed there.\n. When you update branches, you should also cleanup and delete some of them because there are some that weren't updated over 2 years.. When will be v3 released?. @SpaceboyRoss01 Download for version 0.1.6-prealpha in website does not work.. There could be support for both static config and changing in config.. There should also be support for OpenID and OpenID Connect.\nIn the future, there could also be support other authentication and authorization protocols like SAML, LDAP ... and other protocols from https://www.getkisi.com/blog/authentication-protocols-overview. They are generally more for \"business auth\" but it will be great if they will be supported.. ",

I'm trying to make some apps for OS.js and I cannot figure out how to create an about dialog, is there any way to do that?. An about dialog for an application. I found a bug with opening a window.

I might do a pull request later today to add a Vagrantfile since I'll probably use it for my own purposes anyway.\n. Hmm, is the entire project based on Node.js? I may have missed that. I was referring to these backends https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/tree/master/src/server-php.\nEDIT: Also, Node.js and JS aren't synonymous. I don't mind using either, but I'll have to write new Puppet modules and Ansible roles if I want to bring in Node.js to my projects. If I could avoid that, it would be great, if I can't then that's ok too.\n. @andersevenrud That's fantastic to hear. I thought this was the case but hadn't had a chance to look through the entire code base.\n. @christopherdumas Some people are already running LAMP servers and don't want to set up a separate application server for a Python backend. These people would probably prefer the PHP backend. The same argument could be made for any backend.\nI agree that the project shouldn't try to provide all possible backends but perhaps the 2-3 most common. In that regard I think Python has a larger user base than Node.js. I'm also already running Python applications so I would prefer a Python backend. This is why I personally would like to see one. \nI don't think we should get rid of the PHP backend. After Python and Ruby on Rails I think PHP is still widely used.\n. @andersevenrud That would be really great. I took a brief look at implement a Python backend and had to put it down for now because of other commitments. It's not very clear to me 1) where you configure OS.js to use a specific backend, 2) what kind of API the backend should present. I mean, I can take educated guesses at it from the code I've looked at but it would be great if that was documented.\nEDIT: Oh I just saw the link you had posted.

Okay, well, that\u2019s not very useful to you, but you guess it comes in handy sometimes.\nYou pull out the hammer, but to your dismay, it has the claw part on both sides. Still serviceable though, I mean, you can hit nails with the middle of the head holding it sideways.\nYou pull out the pliers, but they don\u2019t have those serrated surfaces; it\u2019s flat and smooth.

PHP is nice, just really, really, really awkward. And it's tempting capabilities have been totally replaced by Handlebars.\n. You have a very good point there.

Well, to provide packages publically.\nOf course in the folder public.\nBut, then a user can delete, alter or replace them.\nBeceause i use nginx it has read-write permissions for nginx.\nBy setting that (sub) folder read only (in linux), the api.php cannot change files.\nImre\n. grinzz, where still don't understand eachother.\nThe folder with read only rights is not the folder to install in,\nbut the folder to install from.\nSince i am placing the (selected) packages in there and it cannot be altered,\ni'm sure it's not malicious.\nOf coarse, i'll have to use root acces. To do so.\nMarking that subfolder as read only, will not prevent te api from accessing it.\nBut it throws an error while linux won't let it.\nimre\n. More like a STORAGE for optional site specific apps.\nOr optional os.js apps\nLet's compare it with the extra's that comes with windows.\nThey come uninstalled, but can be if it fits your needs.\nI got for example a lot administrative tools, only to be used by a\n few admins.\n(protected by user role)\nire\n. sorry, typo. you are absolute correct.\nimre\n. Well, I am writing a accounting system for the node server.\nAnd took the example handler from the php based server.\nFound a few other flaws also, be carefull!\nThe node server was marked with 'work in progress'.\nMaybe the node server need to be altered,\ninstead the handler code.\nimre\n. Confirmed that the code is correct.\nIn the php server is becomes clear that login returns an Object (as json)\nresult.userSettings\nresult.userData\nIn the lacking example handler for node I returned only userData.\nImre\n.

Thought so..... When interupting is reliable,\nthe question could be ''wanne save your session?'\nImre\n. Using zip.js, maybe important beceause i saw that Java is an option too.\nImre\n. Sorry, found more inconsistent behaviour.\nReproduce:\n1. Wipe my home folder.\n2. Wipe my settings & groups data from the mysql table.\n3. Login with the php handler.\nWhat happens:\n1. The handler is creating the home folder.\n2. In the javascript console this error:\nFShome:///Packages/packages.json 404 (Not Found)\nNow install test from your resopitory:\n3. Test is not to find in the menu or the process viewer.\n4. Homefolder looks like this:\nhome:// \nfile: test:zip\nfolder : Packages with empty file packages.json.\nSome suggestions:\n1. Create a folder 'packages' in the home folder at first logon.\n2. Hide that folder from VFS. (Hey, hidden folder function?)\n3. Install the user level applications there.\n4. Missing : cannot find a way to remove user packages.\nImre\n. Hey Anders,\nHidden user packages and 'uninstall' user packages.\nTry to look at it from a real-live production enviroment.\nI, as the owner of a website want to give the users what they need. (What i think they need)\nFor example a read only folder with custom packages, the user can install and use, or remove as they want so.\nUsers, if you got more then a few, do dumb things, like removing files belonging to a package.\nFor them only the package function is important.\nIs this never ment for multi user purpose?\nImaging how many mails ..... :) \n\"So, basically, the problem is that the \"Packages\" folder is missing ?!\"\nNo, i'll tried to cover that by creating it, and also an empty packages.json.\nIn the case of the test.zip from the store:\ntest.zip is placed in the root, unpacked and uninstalled.\nSorry when i\u00e1m no fully clear :(\nImre\n. Yes, I understand the complexity with all of this. Going to try te be more clear.\nA read only folder:\nA folder that can hold things like uninstalled packages, wallpappers to choose from, etc.\nIf a user want to install, the package it is installed in a hidden folder inside the home.\nOn this way, the owner of the site can provide optional functions to the users. The codemirror package for example will be very interessing for programming related websites, but not at all for something about cars.\nSo, why installed in the home folder at all?\nBeceause they are 'per user' installed. If a user is deleted, the folder with the data is also gone.\n\"I still don't understand what you mean. I have to check this out myself.\"\nGoing to repreduce this again, and try yo describe it in more detail.\nImre\n. Test 1: Installing Test.zip from the \"App store\".\nResult: May'be it was ment this way, de Test.zip is copied to the home folder and can be installed frome there.\nTest 2: Installing a package from the home folder. Copied \"RTCGroupVideo.zip\" into the folder.\nResult: Works great !\nTest 3: Install from 'shared' folder. Copied \"Chat.zip\" into the folder.\nResult: Complete confusion, WTF, this is working also!!!!\nDon't understand, did about 20 tests yesterday.\nSorry.\n. Okay, cannot find the parts where i saw 'other'.... it was late :)\nImre\n. ",

Excellent :), I have build it successfully on windows server.\n. @andersevenrud  :) OK, thanks\n. oh, that is like i think. Because the install into server is so HARD for beginners \ud83d\ude08. just extract file and run like symboise\n. The hard is some hosting doesn't allow user use the ternimal xD, but i know the automatic install is easy \ud83d\ude0a. Do you know eyeOS? i think you can do the install like that. i have a question: what is the user-password manager in os.js? database or xml?\n. ;) I think i can install os.js to my hosting. Nah... i'm going to sleep \ud83d\ude2a\n. @andersevenrud,\nWait..., How about the \"installer that runs in the browser\"? Do you have planned yet?\n. Good job, I expect that will have a right direction for os.js :)\n. :/ You're so fast, code in just 1 day :P. I think you should make an app store that display images of the software\n. oh...I forgot it :/, did you have any api, ide,... etc to supporting programming OS.js platform\n. congratulations, your os.js finally had a app store(or not \ud83d\ude06).

The media player can't seek music when music name have Hieroglyphs.\nLike this: \n\n. okay, but this one: \n\nI rename the first file and here it is\n\n. a ha! i missed that ^^~. You need add dockbar, gadget feature to OS.js\nLike this:\n\n. don't you see ;), windows have bar(you can pin app to launch it), ubuntu have sidebar,...\nAnd search app feature too~!. Wait... OS.jsv2 isn't have muliti-select function?\n. Yeah, i tried to rename file but it loading a min and display error.\n. And in future, OS.js will be like Chrome OS, Firefox OS,.. .

I'll try dev some app, too :D\n. Hump... something not right :P. OS.js isn't have any terminal :lol \n. i have an idea! put terminal in setting, user can turn on/off it :tada: \n.

Did OS.js have a update ?(I means OS.js update, it's download update file from server and  pack directly into OS core)\n. oh, it just like Windows Update :P\n. oh ! That is nice idea ;). An update from outside os is more useful. But you need have a admin account to access the admin system control\n. I'm not interested at code in OS.js :(.

That need to dev some app that need internet to run ;)\n. do you think add a web browser is a bad idea? i think it need because os.js will run in a linux-kernel without node\n. really? if need, i will create a web browser for os.js. Let me do that :-)\n. @andersevenrud Do Application IDE done yet? In this time, IDE is need for develop! Please add that to OS.js as soon as possible ;). And... how did you have tetris syndrome --?

    "rubengc": "I want suggest base the design of OSjs on Goggle's Material Design\nGoogle's guidelines:\nhttps://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html\nSome references:\nhttp://materializecss.com/\nhttp://material-ui.com/\nhttp://papyros.io/\nhttp://www.jide.com/en/remixos\n. @andersevenrud haha ok \nI can do all the design so you can dedicate your time on OSjs core\n. This could be the strongest part of the OS, because if people are encouraged to develop apps (like a MySQL manager, web server manager, or native system management) OSjs could replace many management panels, even become an ideal for installation in machines with limited resources as raspberry pi\nAnother great feature of the store,, can be the download/submit of new themes\n. Ah, a comand line app to execute OSjs and native commands will be useful too\nan awesome theme can be this http://andersevenrud.github.io/shell/ xD\n. @andersevenrud That's sound really good!!!\nI will wait impatiently for the results\n. An interesting widget to test this can be a clock for some reasons:\nNeeds to get update every min (or every second)\nHas different sizes\nHas different date formats\nHas different styles (normal or digital)\nIn the future, sure that some apps will have a really useful widgets (the weather, a system usage visor, a RSS feed from your favourite page, a task pending visor, etc)\nEdit: I recomend an app folder structure like:\nMyApp\n- php\n  - script.php\n- css\n  - style.css\n- js\n  - script.js\n- view/html\n  - myviews.html\n- widget\n  - FooWidget\n    - (a folder structure like an app)\n  - BarWidget\n    - (a folder structure like an app)\nInside view/views/html the developer can specify different sizes using large, medium or small folders\n. So the user now will see in the store: apps, widgets and themes right?\nIf someone publish an app, will be interesting add widgets to this installation (asking to the user if he wants to install them too)\nFor example, a twitter app, would want to include a widget with latest tweets\nIn the store, the developer can mark what widgets are included in this app\n.

    "IngwiePhoenix": "Hello there! I wanted to ask some questions and leave some suggestions, as the title nicely suggests :3\nQuestions\n\nOSjs uses PHP or NodeJS as a server, yet they seem differently laid out. Why did you choose to support two different servers? And, which one do you see more beneficial?\nI am already hosting a site. But for working with my staff, I wanted to use OSjs to build an application, so we can share files, co-work on files and alike. Is it possible to take login strategies from another site and implement it in OSjs?\nHave you ever looked at WebPack as a distribution solution for the client?\nIs there any real-time communication with the server (i.e. WebSockets)?\nIs an application bound to only serve client files, or can it also be a server-client application?\n\nSuggestions\n\nLay out the client and server code into two distinct folders. It got me confused at first for where the client and where the server code is. For instance:\n\nos.js/\n  - src/\n    - client/\n    - server/\n      - php/\n      - nodejs/\n  - ...\n- Use a Gitter chatroom to exchange information and run a discussion. That can avoid issue-floods, too. :)\n- Allow the user to specify DB login, database and password. I dont know about the nodejs server, but the PHP server seemed to have this hardcoded.\n- Create a DB abstraction layer, to allow multiple backends. For instance, I might switch from MySQL to Crate - but I would like to carry over the OSjs data. It has a PDO module, and one may write a class with the abstraction to allow OSjs to access that.\n- Provide information on how to install OSjs without docker. I don't have docker on my system, for instance.\nThats all, for now. :) I know it is in alpha stages, so I will not build anything ontop of it just now, but I definitively will. :)\n. @andersevenrud Thanks for your reply! Actually you gave the answers exactly the way that I can understand  them - so, all good. :)\nAs you said you dont have time, you can probably expect a co-worker on this in one or two months. Once I managed to get my main application on the show, I will want to build ontop of OS.js. So I might just as well help out (:\nAgain thanks for the infos! I have this starred and added to my notes of future-relevant projects...so, all good.\nAlso I must give you a compliment on how well the client is written. it doesnt seem bloated and looks very straightforward. :)\n. @andersevenrud Sounds solid. :)\nYou said oyu want to keep it modularized, then I have a few things for you to keep in mind when you do so:\n- If possible, require() relative to the current file.\n- More than once, I have seen pseudo modules, and they actually are super cool. How they work:\n.../\n  - MyModule/\n  - MyModule.js\n... and usage ...\njavascript\nrequire(\"./MyModule\");\n... and in the module itself ...\njavascript\nrequire(\"./MyModule/somefile.js\");\nThe .js file serves as the main entrypoint for the module, whilst th emodule itself can be stored in the same-amed folder. When you figure out that a module has grown to a size that it can be factored out and ran independently, you just rename the .js file into index.js and voila you have a little module :)\n- If possible, do not mix require() and define().\nThat also is a reason I poked about WebPack. Using the notes above, the whole client can be put into a single file without you worrying too much. I use WebPack in my main application, DragonsInn/BIRD3. So if you have questions here, I can help on this one. ^^\nAlso I know how that feels to be a 1-man army for years... XD. That is why I'll freelance for OSjs once I have my application staged into at least a stable beta. Because if there is something that my staff currently lacks, then it is means to cooperate.\nThat is, I see that OS.js really does a good job in being concepted to be open-minded, i.e. you can make your own apps for it. It can be used to build a staff table app, like I do, or as means for remote access for employees. :) There are a few things I can see OS.js being used for.\n. I am not even a native, so it's all good =)\n. Maybe add a demo reset to the deploy chain?\n. @andersevenrud Well, whenever you do a new release, have the demo updated automatically in the deploy/release process? That is what I meant..

I currently change everything in my handler so that the backend is already getting this format. Maybe others also have some suggestions so that it can be done at one time. Also some time to think this through might be good.\n. Great! I will check it out.\n. You are fast! :) I will test it tomorrow as it is getting late here (03:00) :)\nI screwed up my local copy and restoring from origin i seem to miss the file settings.js. And i can't seem to find it and a grunt does not create one. Any idea?\n. Unfortunately that did not work.\nI also did the whole installation process from scratch and that did also not work which is weird as it worked before.\nHow is settings.js created?\n. i got an error. This is from a fresh clone of your os.js here on github?????\n[TypeError: str.replace is not a function] 'TypeError: str.replace is not a func\ntion\\n    at fixWinPath (F:\\os.js\\src\\build.js:252:18)\\n    at F:\\os.js\\src\n\\build.js:802:33\\n    at Array.forEach (native)\\n    at buildServer (F:\\os.js\\\n\\src\\build.js:801:37)\\n    at Object.createConfigurationFiles (F:\\os.js\\src\\\nbuild.js:822:7)\\n    at Object.

At least i can go to sleep now as i got it working again. :) Tomorrow i will test your new branch.\n. :+1: Great!. I will concentrate on my backend first. :)\n. it is the following part. All others ('write','exists' etc) use OSjs.VFS.internalCall and use the loaded handler. This one has its own Ajax part that it uses.\njavascript\n  _NullModule.read = function(item, callback, options) {\n    options = options || {};\n    options.onprogress = options.onprogress || function() {};\n    if ( API.getConfig('Connection.Type') === 'nw' ) {\n      OSjs.Core.getHandler().nw.request('fs', {\n        'method': 'read',\n        'arguments': [\n          item.path,\n          {raw: true}\n        ]\n      }, function(err, res) {\n        callback(err, res);\n      });\n      return;\n    }\n    this.url(item, function(error, url) {\n      if ( error ) {\n        return callback(error);\n      }\n      Utils.ajax({\n        url: url,\n        method: 'GET',\n        responseType: 'arraybuffer',\n        onprogress: function(ev) {\n          if ( ev.lengthComputable ) {\n            options.onprogress(ev, ev.loaded / ev.total);\n          } else {\n            options.onprogress(ev, -1);\n          }\n        },\n        onsuccess: function(response, xhr) {\n          if ( !xhr || xhr.status === 404 || xhr.status === 500 ) {\n            callback(xhr.statusText || response);\n            return;\n          }\n          callback(false, response);\n        },\n        onerror: function(error) {\n          callback(error);\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  };\n. I see you moved some files. It is now in internal.js on line 93\ninternalTransport.read = function(item, callback, options) {\n. If the 'write' goes through the handler i think the read should do the same. The handler could return an ArrayBuffer as well.\nIt will keep everything together which is more convenient. It took me some time to find this exception to the 'rule' and that makes maintaining/porting a bit more difficult. It is also one of the few original files that i needed to change to get my backend working. Ideally all code that uses a different backend should be in the custom handler.\n. Maybe even split _callAPI into _callAPI and _callVFS. Then everything has its own.\n. I am testing them right now. :) It is a lot easier to work with that is for sure! :+1: \n. The write could be a bit easier. :)\nIt is now:\n{ data: \"data:image/png;base64,iVBOR....\"\npath: \"home:////New file.png\" }\nIf you can split the data it would be great. Maybe like this:\n{ path: \"home:///New files.png\", mime: \"image/png\", encoding: \"base64\", data: \"iVBOR.....\"\n. I am not a fan of datauris because once they start to get bigger they slow down things considerably and they can be easily abused. I am not sure if getting a bytearray from a canvas (draw app) is possible so it might be the only way to do it. Converting base64 to bytearray is costly and any conversion should be avoided when possible.\nMy requirements are a bit out of the ordinary and i am very happy that you allowed a custom driver to be made that allows me to adapt for those requirements. One of the requirements is that no GET's are allowed, only POST. Each request has to have a authorization token that is refreshed every 5 minutes. It helps avoiding people sharing those URL's directly in messenger type of applications and emails.\nIn my handler i will just use your datauri and post it so that it can be processed on the server. Splitting and manipulating it client side is then prevented. So no problem if it stays like it is. :)\n. Found a small discrepancy in naming\njavascript\n    if ( method === 'FS:xhr' ) {\n      return this.__callGET(args, options, cbSuccess, cbError);\n    } else if ( method === 'FS:upload' ) {\n      return this.__callPOST(args, options, cbSuccess, cbError);\n    }\nWondering if it would be better if xhr is changed into get.\nI also found that when i load a user application (menu->System->Test), like on the demo, the request for the .js and .css files do not go through the handler. In my case that results in not being able to load that file. It is a request with this url: http://mydomain.com/FS/get/home:///.packages/Test/main.js . I expected it to be a FS:xhr.\nThe loading of home:///.packages/packages.json right after the login does go through the custom handler.\n. If there is a get in the osjs that is not in home/shared/os.js folders then it just passes the handler. I don't need to stop gets that just load a css file or a script only when they are in those directories as i need to keep user data absolutely separated. Also shared folder is only between users of the same organisation. The handler stuffs a authorizationtoken in the request and the backend makes sure that it only honors that request when the token is valid. The backend is already setup and works fine. To make the frontend way more better OSjs is fabulous and will surely make deploying stuff much easier. The current frontend is a older style website in need of modernization. :)\n. I already have a working backend with users. Each user has its own private folder and a shared folder that is shared between users from the same company/organization. Those folders are protected against access with a token. To prevent users copy/pasting URLs all requests for data in those folders is through a POST which contains a token in the body or header. Once a users logs in he gets a token that is valid for 5 minutes. The backend checks this against its database and when correct it honors the request and returns the data. The token is now in the body but is being migrated to a request header to accommodate uploading which is not a functionality right now.\nIf you want i can give you a login to see how the requests are done, easy to see with chrome network tab.,\nI realize this is not common at all, but if i can get this working by just adding the right code in the customs handler it is a good test to see how modular the VFS is.\n. Just as some info, this is how the request looks like for a scandir:\nRequest URL:http://mydomain.com/FS/scandir\nRequest Method:POST\nStatus Code:200 OK\nRemote Address:10.10.10.10:80\nResponse Headers\nCache-Control:no-cache\nContent-Length:345\nContent-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8\nDate:Fri, 29 Jan 2016 15:20:36 GMT\nExpires:-1\nPragma:no-cache\nServer:Microsoft-IIS/8.5\nX-AspNet-Version:4.0.30319\nX-Powered-By:ASP.NET\nRequest Headers\nProvisional headers are shown\nContent-Type:application/json\nOrigin:http://mydomain.com\nReferer:http://mydomain.com\nUser-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/47.0.2526.111 Safari/537.36\nX-DevTools-Emulate-Network-Conditions-Client-Id:CEC005AD-A20A-491B-BA56-E20FC73D6BCD\nRequest Payload\nview source\n{token: \"F13693A3-6165-485D-9DF1-DFD21E01D281\", path: \"home:///.packages\"}\npath: \"home:///.packages\"\ntoken: \"F13693A3-6165-485D-9DF1-DFD21E01D281\"\n. When i click on a menu item of a application (test1) that is installed in the home directory of the user i do not get that request in the custom handler. Sofar that is the only exception i have found. There might be some others but i did not encounter them.\n. A gotcha on a windows server running IIS is that some characters are not allowed in a URL. It can be modified but it is there for a reason.\nThe characters are <,>,*,%,:,&\nAs you are using a \":\" as part of the url the request is being killed on a very early moment in the pipeline, even before it reaches asp.net code. It is not catchable.\na url like this:\nhttp://mydomain.com/FS/get/home:///.packages/Test/main.js \ncauses that problem as a \":\" is in it.\nFor people who want to run this on a windows server this is pretty important. It can be solved but it is not something most people know. And if it can be avoided, the better.\nThe error that is shown is:\nA potentially dangerous Request.Path value was detected from the client (:).\nDropping the \":\" from the url seems the easiest way to solve this.\n. I understand. It is not that big of a deal as it is solvable.\nHowever this is probably something like 99% of people working on IIS do not know and it is a pain to get it allowed. Even if they find the solution it is often forbidden by IT or even hosts.\nMy request is if the \":\" can be dropped or maybe changed into a character that is allowed. You would then have no future questions why it is not running on IIS. :)\n. It is more these kind of requests:\nhttp://osjsv2.0o.no/FS/get/home:///.packages/Test/main.js\nThey are not going through the custom handler ( i expected that first).\nI saw that this particular case is a bit more difficult as it is used for the src attribute of a script tag that is added to the page.\nIf your intention is to let that request go through the handler then it is easy to solve.\nHowever your script adding technique is then not goin to work.\nAn alternative that will work is if you add script like this:\njavascript\n    var JS= document.createElement('script');\n    //Let the handler do the request and have the result in the variable code.\n    JS.text= code;\n    document.body.appendChild(JS);\nThe \":\" is mostly used for schemes. http:, ftp: etc. But you already know that of course.\nI think having two schemes in a url can also cause problems on mobile browsers as they are used often for activating an app. Hope i made my case. :) :)\n. /FS/get/?path={urlencodedpath}\nThis would be fine.\nAn alternative, and maybe even easier would be to allow the handler to modify the url.\nThe handler is the one that talks to the backend and in my opinion each request (certainly the ones that uses a users folders) should go through it.\n. Great!\n. Thanks! The name seems fine, but i reserve the right to change my mind. :)\n. In my custom handler.\nWebAPIHandler.prototype.callAPI = function (method, args, cbSuccess, cbError, options)\nmethod is \"FS:xhr\"\nargs = { path: \"/FS/gethome:///.packages/packages.json\" }\n. ",

You can render it with the widest character, or if that's not clear or consistent between fonts, render it with each digit and take the widest measurement. Do this when the format changes (setting the width to auto first).\n. Sure, whatever works, but it shouldn't be too hard to implement using exact measurements (using getComputedStyle)\n. @andersevenrud That's the point. You set the text before doing the calculation, so you get the width of e.g. \"88:88:88\" (if 8 is the widest digit) and then set style.width to the resulting offsetWidth or clientWidth (+ \"px\" of course) and then set the text back to what it's supposed to show.\n. > or if that's not clear or consistent between fonts, render it with each digit and take the widest measurement\n.

    "piranna": "OS.js can run standalone from a file:// scheme, so the same could be done with a static web server. On the other hand, doing so seems there some missing backend functionality... What I ask for is to isolate this backend functionality (maybe in its own project? One for Node.js and another for PHP?) and remove the static web server part from the OS.js server leaving only the operational one.\n. > I am definately going to make better support for static web servers (such\n\nas NW.js, which I have tested). This will involve making a VFS module first\nso you can manipulate files etc.\n\nOther option is to create a Chrome App, that's already packages and\nself-contained and also nw.js now has support for them :-) Just don't use\nprivate navigator.chrome.* APIs, please ;-)\n\nSo, basically take src/server/ and split them into separate repos ?\n\nI was asking more about the servers only having the backend functionality\nand remove their static file functionality, but yes, it's an option,\nspecially if you left this repo for pure static client-side content, and\nwould also help to make it more portable to other systems and languajes :-)\n. > Aha! Now I get it. That is something that never crossed my mind. I will definately look more into this. Thanks :)\nYou are welcome :-) Yeah, since I proposed on NodeOS to have a DAV server for the files operations including servir the GUI, the only remaining ones specific for each application (including the desktop) are fairly minimal, like requesting auth or do some background process. There's no need to serve static files if you already have a static web server :-)\n. > I got around to solving this :) NW.js builds now have access to the backend functionality also!\nThat's cool! :-D The backend functionality is in a different process from the one of NW.js, isn't it? How are you defining the URL of the server? How are you doing the communications? :-)\n. So is that module the one that does the communications?\n. Do you have it as an independent project somewhere? Maybe you would be interested on this issue created by @lite20\n. Seems to me it's more oriented for the protocol layer, or it should be. I'll review it again to be sure.\n. You are welcome :-) Could you be able to notify here when it's ready and\nwhere to read the docs? :-)\nEl 09/01/2016 01:18, \"Anders Evenrud\" notifications@github.com escribi\u00f3:\n\nI'm closing this issue now, because it has been resolved.

That's cool! :-D And seems pretty simple :-) Could it be possible in a future version to change the HTTP File Requests to use a pure WebDAV server instead of a custom protocol? This would left the backend server fairly minimal, just for the applications management :-)\n. > WebDAV is supported by the client :)\n\nOk, so the client can be configured to use WebDAV as file backend the same way it's able to use GDrive or Dropbox, isn't it?\n\nThe custom server-side file handling is made this way to allow multiple types of endpoints with minimal configuration. This way you don't have to rely on only (ex) WebDAV for file access (pretty vaguely explained... but hope you get the idea)\n\nBut is it needed the OS.js file server to have access to the files from the client, or is optional?\nI think I'll need an arrows-and-boxes graph to understand the architecture of OS.js... :-P\n. > Ok, so the client can be configured to use WebDAV as file backend the same way it's able to use GDrive or Dropbox, isn't it?\n\nYep :)\nBut is it needed the OS.js file server to have access to the files from the client, or is optional?\nIt is completely optional!\n\nOk! I'll need to get some time to learn how to get this working :-P\n\nI think I'll need an arrows-and-boxes graph to understand the architecture of OS.js... :-P\nI had one, but it is now very outdated. Another one in the works! I will notify you when done :)\n\nYeah, I'll need one of these... :-P\n. That's a bit more clear, thank you :-) On the scheme I propose for NodeOS\nthe Filesystem and Resource servers are the same one, and by following the\nWebDAV protocol it can be shared by all the apps, that's why I created\nDavius. This way, the only one required server is the one for the API\noperations :-)\nEl 31/1/2016 7:49, \"Lite McFish\" notifications@github.com escribi\u00f3:\n\nThis is the first draft of how the Server APIs work :P\nClean interface.

Just to drop by :-P I implemented Davius, my own static HTTP/WebDAV server, if you are interested :-) I'm planning to use it to serve the static content and manage the file operations on NodeOS (that's why I asked about WebDAV support :-P ).\n. Cool :-)\n.

    "TRoskop": "I'm sorry that I was not able to explain my idea correctly.\nMy Idea is an app, which allows user to test and try you OS very easy.\nIf the app is in the Windows Store [https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/store/apps], more people can see it. And they can try it very simple: just pressing \"install\" and waiting a few seconds. Once loaded, the users starts the app and it shows tutorials, informations and of course the OS. \nThe user can try the app and if he likes it, he can click one button to download the setup or any supported Debian-ISO for installing.\nAll in all it is like a big \"demo\" so normal users can try the OS. \nJavascript-API: My Idea about API is that you can inform the user when a new version is available or when something happened. Like an newsfeed.\nIf you are interested, I can give more details in a few days. Including Concept-Art etc.\n. Of course, a link is very easy, but it always runs in a normal browser, which cuts you possibility down. But this app can offer a lot more features - for you as developer and for the consumer.\nYou known how the tiles on Win8/8.1/10 look like? If not, google it. You can use them to show new informations in an non-invasive way, it just looks like a small notifications. \nAnd the APIs can be extended in a bigger way. Using these APIs you can use almost everything the device has to offer, including storage, quering user-name and using the users music- or image-files. With a normal browser you can't do that, can you? \nHere is a small overview, what function the JS-API could unlock for you. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211377.aspx\nAnd the app would allow to have a good user experience regardless of the browser.\nI'll bring some concept later, just for you to see what I mean. I think you'll like it, once you understand what I mean.\nAnd I'm sorry, I'm from Germany so my English is probably not the best :smile: \n. First, on a lot of devices normal apps cannot run anylonger, only windows apps are supported. Seconds, users trust store apps more as they know they cannot harm their computer. \nI'll explain the APIs later. \nEdit: And you UI will look nicer, because you will not have the big and ugly browser frame around you, just a normal window border.\n. Hello, I'm back again.\nHere are the \"concept designs\" I promised you.\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, I thought what to do with APIs.\nI think I can be able to add APIs to the Javascript-Interface which allow your app to do some native stuff.\nFor example:\n\nOSjsAppRuntimeEngine.QueryAllUserPictures() \nmight return you a list of the images in the users \"Picture\" folder. \nor:\nOSjsAppRuntimeEngine.ReadFile(filename) | OSjsAppRuntimeEngine.StartUpload(filename, targetUrl, callbackEventHandler)\nenables you to read a complete file (like pictures, text files or videos)\n[Note: These APIs are one for demonstrating, these are not the final ones, just to show what would be possible]\n\nIn these arts I've not included the live tiles or toast, but they should be well known :smile: \nI'm waiting for you feedback. \n. You understood me wrong. You can't read the local user files on my disk! If you could this, browser would have a serious security issue.\n. Good. \nIt this you final word? \nWell, it's your decision. \n. You said, that the NW is already enough. So this means for me, that you don't need a windows universal platform app (for the windows store).\nI'm I right? \n\nMy decision to what now ? \nIt's your decision whether I'm going to develop it or not. \n. Of course, I have everything to do it. It would also not be very hard.\nBut as OS.js is your \"baby\" I want to have your \"ok\" to do so. And I'm not going to develop the app just for fun. I want to make it so, that people can use it simple and that a lot of people can use it.\n. I understand your thinking.\nHowever, I will try to create an app these weeks so you can see a first preview.\n\nAnd of course, OS.js can be improved, but it is already very good. :laughing: \n. - A Browser would be realy cool. \nSee, this means development is stil happening. And if you increase your audience, probably more people will donate money or help you with bug reports, suggestions, patches, pull requests etc.\n- Having good marketing (social media, blogs writing about this app, ...) we can increase the audience to a new level. \n. Just a small appendix:\nThe app I started to create is not a \"Stand-Alone\" Client! It uses a/the server of os.js. \n. I'm still working on the app (or at least I try it), but currently I've a lot of other stuff to do like school.\n. Hi Guys!\nI'm now finished the app. And it passed the certrification kit.\nYou can see here, how the first version looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm going fix the last few things - only UI and language fixes and improving some code.\nLater, I'm going to submit the app to the windows store. And the Code will be available once I uploaded the source code to GitHub.\nWaiting for your feedback. \n. @eraffaelli  This would be very nice. I'm hopeing to publish it soon. \n. @andersevenrud \nOf course the app will not appear as the top-most one in the store. But you can find it under the specific category. It works like the Google Play Store.\nMoreover, you can define keywords and so on. \nLet's give it a try. We can't lose anything. And who knows, if this works as I hope, it would be good.\nSo, calm don't and publish :smile: \n. Do you, @andersevenrud , have Windows 10 (or a virtual machine of it)? Because then I could send you the first stable build to side-load it (No Visual Studio IDE needed).\n. @khoaakt \n\nMaybe a winform app looks great for testing on non-Windows 10! After build, the app will automatic start to testing... Right?\n\nI'm sorry, but you can't convert/build a windows 10 app (WUP Windows universal platform) on non-windows 10 systems. It's because of the new WinRT (Windows Runtime).\nHowever, those apps are realy not compareable to winform-apps. They are more like Software written in WPF for the desktop.\nYou need Win10.\n. @andersevenrud I will upload the image (which you can install in just a few clicks) to you later. How can I send you a private message with the download-link? \n[You other guys will get the next, more stable build, once @andersevenrud allowed to publish it :D ]\n. @khoaakt \nI planned to implement some extended JavaScript-API for os.js in my app (and I also created already two ones).\nWould you like to say me when starting, so I can give you the APIs so we have the same ones so os.js can use them?? \n. @andersevenrud \nInstead of downloading those IE-versions, just download the windows 10 ISO and use it as the demo version (30 day trials). This might be more helpful.\n. @khoaakt: Please could you notify me by email in this case. Because I do not regulary look on this issues. \nt.roskop@hotmail.de\n. @andersevenrud \nI just send you the email.\n. I published the app and it has been accepted.\nHere is the link to the app: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh5p91g\n[Note: It might need a few hours until the app can be downloaded.]\n. They gave me a New link   https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH5P91G. \n. Please give me feedback and suggestions for improving. I also accept them by email: t.roskop@hotmail.de\nI'll work on it and I'll later publish the source code. :+1: \n. @eraffaelli:\nCould you explain what exacly is wrong?

The only way to make a browser would be to have a proxy running in the background, or use something like NW.\n\nOf course, a link is very easy, but it always runs in a normal browser, which cuts you possibility down. But this app can offer a lot more features - for you as developer and for the consumer.\n\n\nHe means that he could bridge some Universal App feature to the JS, so you can reach it when your app running in his universal app. Aaaaand this makes no sense to me, since almost everything is possible in the evergreen browsers what you can do in an universal app except accessing the file system of the device. (You have notifications, background workers, etc. in browsers too)\n\nAnd the app would allow to have a good user experience regardless of the browser.\n\nToday browsers are evergreen, except IEs under IE10 but if someone still use IE10 then they are not the target audience for this project. \n\nSeconds, users trust store apps more as they know they cannot harm their computer.\n\nAn app could do more harm than a webpage. :wink: \n. > First, on a lot of devices normal apps cannot run anylonger, only windows apps are supported. Seconds, users trust store apps more as they know they cannot harm their computer.\nI don't know from where did you get that people trust universal apps more? Can you provide some source? \nI see your point (that a lot of windows 10 devices like phones cant run Win32 apps), but the idea what you are talking about is very hard to work with. Because if we make an app to give special features to the OS.js on WIndows then we should do it on the other first class citizen platforms like iOS, Android, Mac, Linux and this makes any change 5x more harder to implement. \n\nEdit: And you UI will look nicer, because you will not have the big and ugly browser frame around you, just a normal window border.\n\nYes, as it's not visible in the NW.version either. \n. NW.js runs on OSX too. \n. Guys, have you ever read the nw.js docs? Nw.js has access almost to all of the native features of windows, osx and linux. Including the filesystem, notifications and few other goodies in a wrapper + everything else what Node.js can reach, so there is no advantage of implementing a custom host application layer. It's a better idea to contribute to nw.js to add the missing features.\n. > There's no need to include anything. Node provides everything you need. (If I am not mistaking you here)\nYeah, u can call from node anything (there are modules for almost everything), but if @tirrorex  want to have some higher leve abstraction of something, its still a way more simpler to implement it as a native addon for node (so it become usable by nw.js) than implementing everything from scratch. \n. @andersevenrud  Some kind of black hole, what eatS everything? hehe\n. Yay! \n. Just a small note on the commit messages, you should use them like\n\nIf applied, this commit will your commit message\n\nRight way: If applied, this commit will Add bcryptjs to npm install\nWrong way: If applied, this commit will Added bcryptjs to npm install\n.

Would this be an Ace issue or an OS.js issue? I believe more OS.js than Ace. https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-extras/blob/master/AceEditor/main.js#L75 sets the syntax to JS automatically. Maybe if this can be changed to detect the extension and set it to the correct syntax? I'll try some stuff and open a pull if I get anything successful..

Hi\nMy setup is nginx with the configuration I copied from os.js install instructions.\nThe major problem is the cpu utilized by os.js AND nginx while viewing a video.\nMaybe on a pc, it could be small, but on a small arm system like mine, it is big.\nWhen I read a video using smplayer from the nginx server (static file), it takes 0 cpu.\nSo it looks that the webplayer could be making a lot of requests, or something like that. \nEven when connecting to os.js though ssh port redirection, the high cpu is the same.\nAbout the hangs, the problem didn't happen on all video files. It seems to depend on the audio or video encoding.\n. php backend? \nit looks like a proxy_pass\nlocation / {\n        auth_basic \"closed site\";\n        auth_basic_user_file htpasswd;\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\n    }\nI'm using armbian on a cubietruck.\n. the problem is also here when connected through ssh tcp port redirect (without nginx)\nI noticed that there were a lot of system cpu usage, and did an strace of the server:\nepoll_ctl(5, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, 22, {EPOLLIN, {u32=22, u64=22}}) = 0\nepoll_wait(5, {{EPOLLIN, {u32=8, u64=8}}}, 1024, 120000) = 1\nclock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {3057801, 885597525}) = 0\nread(8, \"\\1\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\", 1024)       = 8\nfutex(0xb650046c, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1) = 1\nfutex(0x1230a4, FUTEX_WAKE_OP_PRIVATE, 1, 1, 0x1230a0, {FUTEX_OP_SET, 0, FUTEX_OP_CMP_GT, 1}) = 1\nfutex(0x123080, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1)  = 1\ngettimeofday({1477248236, 381248}, NULL) = 0\nwrite(22, \"10000\\r\\n\\200\\\\66\\230\\263P\\373?>w\\37{h\\214&,e\\336S0\\307\\303\\345\\316\"..., 65545) = 65545\nclock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {3057801, 898620961}) = 0\nfutex(0xb650046c, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1) = 1\ngettimeofday({1477248236, 390454}, NULL) = 0\nepoll_ctl(5, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, 22, {EPOLLIN, {u32=22, u64=22}}) = 0\nepoll_wait(5, {{EPOLLIN, {u32=8, u64=8}}}, 1024, 120000) = 1\nclock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {3057801, 901299566}) = 0\nread(8, \"\\1\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\", 1024)       = 8\nfutex(0xb650046c, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1) = 1\nfutex(0x1230a4, FUTEX_WAKE_OP_PRIVATE, 1, 1, 0x1230a0, {FUTEX_OP_SET, 0, FUTEX_OP_CMP_GT, 1}) = 1\nfutex(0x123080, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1)  = 1\ngettimeofday({1477248236, 398788}, NULL) = 0\nwrite(22, \"10000\\r\\n\\223\\23;\\263e\\212\\374\\302\\313\\341u\\324d`v\\262\\6\\25\\200\\222x\\351\\260C\\332\"..., 65545) = 65545\nclock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {3057801, 913430786}) = 0\nfutex(0xb650046c, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1) = 1\ngettimeofday({1477248236, 405757}, NULL) = 0\nepoll_ctl(5, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, 22, {EPOLLIN, {u32=22, u64=22}}) = 0\nepoll_wait(5, {{EPOLLIN, {u32=8, u64=8}}}, 1024, 120000) = 1\nAnother note: after something like a minute, it seems that it stops...\n.
