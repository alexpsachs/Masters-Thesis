Model binaries and prototxt files have been upgraded. The demo returns the same results as before. I haven't tested fine-tuning yet, but it should be fine. \nI played around a bit with the different CPU BLAS options (MKL, Atlas, and OpenBLAS (multicore)). MKL was usably fast (~45s / image). Atlas was too slow to use (I killed it after a few of minutes). OpenBLAS was much slower than MKL (~220s / image with CPU utilization going between 100% and 1200% on a six-core i7).\n. Thanks for pointing that out.\n. Since this is a Caffe installation question, you should open an issue here: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.\n. The test code certainly does, since at test time one does not know about (or assume) the presence of objects in the image. The code should also properly handle training images that do not contain any ground truth positive examples, though I haven't tested this case explicitly. \n. ILSVRC training is described here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524. The corresponding code is in the ilsvrc branch.\n. I haven't been able to reproduce this error on my ubuntu 12.04 system.

It is safe to ignore this warning. The model was serialized with a pointer to a function that exists only in the ilsvrc branch. The warning does not impair the functionality of the model or demo. (Are you sure that warning wasn't for the ILSVRC13 model? That's where I have seen it.)\n. My recommendation is to the look at the provided demo. It computes\nselective search boxes on an example image. You can generalize that code to\ncompute selective search boxes on your dataset.

Please follow the README and use the correct URL in the fetch_data.sh script.\n. Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be incorrect. Maybe you compiled caffe using CUDA 5.5, for example, and have the path to the CUDA 6.0 libs in your library path? This is a problem with your particular setup, so I'm going to close it.\n. It is safe to ignore this warning. The model was serialized with a pointer to a function that exists only in the ilsvrc branch. The warning does not impair the functionality of the model or demo. (Are you sure that warning wasn't for the ILSVRC13 model? That's where I have seen it.)\n. My recommendation is to the look at the provided demo. It computes\nselective search boxes on an example image. You can generalize that code to\ncompute selective search boxes on your dataset.

I have tryed it and run rcnn_demo in CPU MODE successfully,Thank you very much@michael-panayiotou\uff0c But there is a problem with \"KMP_DUBLICATE_LIB_OK'.The rigth order is \nsetenv('KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK','TRUE');\n. In GPU MODE the Demo still can't work\uff0cthe error logging by GoogleLogging in Terminal is:\"relu_layer.cu:29  Check failed:error == cudaSuccess(9 vs. 0)  invalid configuration argument\"\nI will check it\n. In Matlab set the environmental variable \"KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK\" to be TRUE. To do this just write the following command in Matlab.\nsetenv('KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK','TRUE');\n. @fischeCPP  sorry,I only succeed in CPU mode\n. I have a same  problem with you,did you solve it?@michael-panayiotou \n\nAbort signal detected at Thu Aug  7 15:50:54 2014\n\nConfiguration:\n  Crash Decoding  : Disabled\n  Current Visual  : 0x21 (class 4, depth 24)\n  Default Encoding: UTF-8\n  GNU C Library   : 2.15 stable\n  MATLAB Root     : /usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a\n  MATLAB Version  : 7.14.0.739 (R2012a)\n  Operating System: Linux 3.11.0-26-generic #45~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 04:02:35 UTC 2014 x86_64\n  Processor ID    : x86 Family 6 Model 42 Stepping 7, GenuineIntel\n  Virtual Machine : Java 1.6.0_17-b04 with Sun Microsystems Inc.

I have tryed it and run rcnn_demo in CPU MODE successfully,Thank you very much@michael-panayiotou\uff0c But there is a problem with \"KMP_DUBLICATE_LIB_OK'.The rigth order is \nsetenv('KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK','TRUE');\n. In GPU MODE the Demo still can't work\uff0cthe error logging by GoogleLogging in Terminal is:\"relu_layer.cu:29  Check failed:error == cudaSuccess(9 vs. 0)  invalid configuration argument\"\nI will check it\n. In Matlab set the environmental variable \"KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK\" to be TRUE. To do this just write the following command in Matlab.\nsetenv('KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK','TRUE');\n. @fischeCPP  sorry,I only succeed in CPU mode\n. ",

Hi @mahatmawoo \uff0csorry\uff0cI got this message today.\nHere is the solution in my rcnn_pool5_to_fcX.m file\n       feat = max(0, bsxfun(@plus, feat*squeeze(rcnn_model.cnn.layers(i).weights{1}), ...\n                           reshape(rcnn_model.cnn.layers(i).weights{2},...\n                           size(rcnn_model.cnn.layers(i).weights{2},3),...\n                           size(rcnn_model.cnn.layers(i).weights{2},4))));\nbecause the dims of feat and weight are different ,so I changed the weights dim.\nHope this can help you.\n. I have got the solution. In Matlab R2014a, I use the squeeze and reshape function in the rcnn_pool5_to_fcX file, and finally I got an output as described in the paper.\n.
