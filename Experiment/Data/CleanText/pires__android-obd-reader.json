    "pires": "This crash is related to SpeedObdCommandresult parsing. Perhaps the response is invalid for that request! Will look at it for release 2.0.\n. @jabyeah can you try with the latest code?\n. Can you please describe the value the ECU returns? Preferably in byte notation.\n. Yeah, I'm closing whenever that gets implemented.\n. This has been implemented in obd-java-api v0.10, https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/commit/f5c4361500558d9f80516a3b35263d4694fc8721. Anyone care to try it?\n. Awesome!\n. Thanks :-)\n. Fixed with 8f0a19d33e17d47f912f440fd509aa4de1baa102\n. This is closed now @nomwerp, right?\n. Implemented in obd-java-api 0.5 release.\n. Thanks for your support. We'll be in touch next week.\n. OK, so I'm about to receive a Nexus 7 and will be able to get this fixed really soon. Keep with me :-)\n. Hi @kenticus. I've just released a new version of the API (which now is a separate project) and am in the middle of improving the app but am having issues with Android Studio (bummer!).\nAlso, and so far, I haven't issues with Android 4.3 (Nexus 7 2013, latest OTA) and Cyanogenmod 10.2-NIGHTLY (Galaxy Nexus). So, I'm expecting that at least I may fix your issue by revamping the entire base-code.\n. @GH0S1R33P0R it seems @kenticus had an issue with his ELM327 device. A new one fixed it!\n. Interesting. Will sleep on this and eventually have it merged.\n. @abhijitpandey you may have lost connectivity to your ELM327 device.\nSee this thread.\n. Great! Thanks @spapas\n. Will have a look next week.\n. I'm not sure I follow you, but will do some tests with your solution and come back to this.\n. @sebaroesch can you please try with latest version of the code?\n. Closing inactive issue.\n. Actually, the value should be calculated right after the response is read so that we guarantee the calculations are executed only once. I'll be working on this.\n. Fixed. Also, I've moved the API to its own project.\n. This dependency has been removed. Data storage and upload will be rewritten. If you want to contribute with ideas on how this should be featured, check at https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/android-obd-reader-users/Fhl-hKI4Y_s\n. Did you clone the masterbranch from this repository? I see no reference to that plug-in in obd-reader/pom.xml.\n. Can you please update to the latest commit? Anyway, I messed up obd-java-api 0.2 release. I'll fix it by the end of the day.\n. Did you edit the Bluetooth device MAC address on purpose? Or did you change anything related to the Bluetooth code available in the master branch?\n[BluetoothDevice: address=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, alias=OBDII work, name=OBDII, majorDeviceClass=7936, deviceClass=7964] just don't seem right.\n. I don't see any timeout in the logs you shared. Actually, I see that the device is connected and the system reports back that action. I just don't have a callback for it (which seems to be the way to deal with this in JELLY_BEAN_MR2 or newer) but it doesn't matter.\nCan you provide more logs from adb logcat?\n. This issue references #18.\n. You're using an emulator? I never tested with an emulator. Try a real vehicle and let us know!\n. I have one similar to the black one and it works. Never tested with hardware emulator, nor do I have access to one, so I'm unable to debug this.\n. OK, I will have to reverify how commands are executed and read from the buffer.\n. @cesarizu your issue is gone with that fix, then? I've never seen such messages with my ELM327 devices, but I trust your idea and how pleasantly it was provided. Thank you!\n@olimpotec @omarpontis @ReNDeZOwnler can you please verify this as well?\n. @cesarizu thank you for your contribution. It's been merged and released as version 0.4. Now, let's wait for some more feedback.\n. Sorry, but can't debug the app as I don't have an emulator. Will close this, since a fix, if any, can be made available.\n. What is the error you're seeing?\nAlso, what version of the code are you running?\n. Never seen \"CONNECTING\" as a response, or any of the other strings for that matter.. so I can't help with debugging that device :-(\n. Closing as it's rather impossible to debug every device.\n. Nice catch. Will fix!\n. Thanks @spapas \n. installDebug needs you to have ADB installed and the phone connected (through USB or network).\n. I'm going to close this and let's follow #7 \n. Nice catch. Will fix.\n. Not fixed yet. Looking forward your contributions, guys :-)\n. Trouble codes were added in https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/commit/66ad7f107e006053e1d790081fa83ad62849742c\n. Nice catch. Thank :-)\n. Thanks once again :-)\n. Does this fix #22?\n. Thanks @spapas. You're contributions are invaluable!\n. Great!\nRegarding #26 it's an usability issue and this doesn't fix it. This is more of a \"developer\" debugging feature which should be configurable in the future.\n. I'm sorry, but that doesn't match the provided code. https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/blob/master/src/main/java/pt/lighthouselabs/obd/reader/net/ObdReading.java\n. Sorry, but unfortunately I cannot say for sure which vehicles implement this command. Regulations only force emission-related commands to be implemented.\n. Excellent @spapas!\n. What is Mode 1?\nIf data returns STOPPED it's your ELM327 device.\n. Unfortunately, I'm unable to assist you as of the moment. Will be glad to take a look at your future contributions, though.\n. Thanks for your contribution @nomwerp.\n. As detailed in README.md one should use Android Studio and not Eclipse.\n. The fix has been merged into obd-java-api, but right now I'm unable to provide a new release of the said library. Will try somewhere in the next weekend. Thanks for the fix @spapas \n. I'm closing this as the fix provided by @spapas will be available in obd-java-api 0.7 release, to be made available tomorrow.\n. Interesting but will have to take a better look at it before merging. Will probably merge in another branch, make my changes and merge into master.\n. @alonsodub code is the existing documentation. I believe it's self-explanatory as there are many comments included.\n. hey @nomwerp how about taking a look at this, especially the GPS integration and interface?\n. @nomwerp yes, I'd be glad to take a look at smaller commits (without the indent size changes and some other things I've commented in the PR diff).\n. @fabcira want to let you know this contribution is of value to me. Unfortunately, it's really hard to verify such a huge patch. Hope you have the time and will to catch up with the current code and clean-up this PR ;-)\n. This is fixable in obd-java-api project. Can you provide a fix, please?\n. This has been fixed in obd-java-api and will be released in 0.7 later this week.\n. Would be great if you could double check this in obd-java-api project.\n. Probably increasing the sleep time between a command is sent an read is the way to go (obd-java-api). ELM327 and OBD are really a major PITA.\n. Probably the threading part needs some love :-)\n. The existing obd-java-api is agnostic to the transport protocol, so it's perfectly possible. Will you contribute code for this?\n. Awesome!!\n. @spapas, people just don't read the instructions.\n. Logs please?\n. I'm gonna trust you've tested this since I have no way of testing it as of the moment. Thanks for your contribution.\n. Using Eclipse is not supported and not recommended.\n. See https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/blob/master/src/main/java/pt/lighthouselabs/obd/enums/ObdProtocols.java\n. Out of the scope of this project. Please, try Google or Stackoverflow.\n. Just read the instructions on the main page on how to install and test this app.\n. I'm trusting you have tested this. Thanks a lot for your contribution :-)\n. Yes, my experiments resulted in the same conclusion.\n. Can you fix it and provide a PR for obd-java-api? Will be glad to merge. Thanks\n. @Hesamedin obd-java-apiis the actual OBD implementation. This project is just an Android app that usesobd-java-api`` for OBD operations.\nI'll close this when your PR gets in.\n. To be honest, just now I realized the command we're talking here. Fuel related commands usually don't work. Manufacturers don't implement the standard and charge for proprietary commands access. This class and others related should disappear. \n. I'm sorry, but this is a disruptive change. Please:\n- Do not remove Roboguice;\n- Do not force your code indenting, but follow current one (tabs are spaces, 2 spaces per tab);\n- Break into small changes/several PR's.\n. Thanks @nomwerp for another great contribution.\n. I understand your concern but at the time the only thing that mattered to me was to catch any I/O exception thrown by the socket handling code.\nI'm actually OK with merging this and eventually provide enhancements.\n. Tbh, I dislike explicit threading on Android. That's why you have stuff like AsyncTask. Anyway, the code looks good and so I'm merging it.\nCloses #40\n. @nomwerp would you like to become a contributor to this project?\n. You're given it more time than I do so.. :-) thanks a lot!\n. https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/blob/master/src/main/java/pt/lighthouselabs/obd/reader/io/ObdGatewayService.java#L49\n. Thanks @jeepingben \n. Good catch, thanks!\n. Hey @elagin going to try this later on. Can you ping me tomorrow if I don't give feedback? Thanks!\n. Thanks @elagin \n. Well, it's an interesting idea to ask the user to enable it before starting the app and helping him doing that. But of course, we still need to validate the device is paired as well.\nWe can also ask the user if he wants to disconnect Bluetooth when the app is stopped.\n. > The idea was to store the state of bluetooth before running the application and return it after the call stopLiveData ()\nWhat do you mean by store the state of bluetooth?\nI believe thinks work as expected now and we only need to validate more scenarios when Bluetooth is enabled/disabled by the user.\n. Oh, now I get it. Well, it's good to try turning it on/off depending on the app lifecycle. I'll be waiting for a PR to better assess this behavior.\n. Intents are always the best way to do it in Android.\n. Can we close this one?\n. @nomwerp I'll leave this for you to review ;-)\n. Thank you once more @elagin!\n. I wish we could just get proper fuel consumption support.\n. We'll see how that works out :)\n. @nomwerp I can add support for multiple records in one PUT on obd-server, but this doesn't mean it's one single record in the database for all the entries, because it will be not. Unless, we were storing JSON documents.\n. Thank you @nomwerp \n. So you'll be storing JSON on your database?\n. This works if the fields don't exist beforehand on your schema?\n. Ah OK :-) I'm trying to avoid that because we never know when a user adds a tailored command.\n. +1 for @nomwerp idea. Please open a new issue and discuss there.\n. LGTM!\n. Thank you so much @elagin \n. @elagin @nomwerp I believe this was added recently, right?\n. Thanks @elagin. Waiting for a PR then ;-)\n. @FunThomas76 fix LGTM. Care to try it out and let us know if it worked?\n. @FunThomas76 reopening and waiting on your feedback to close the issue ;-)\n. Awesome!\n. @elagin LGTM. Can I merge?\n. Thank you @elagin. You and @nomwerp have brought a new life to this project.\n. LGTM. Thanks\n. @elagin is this a WIP or can I merge?\n. @elagin can you rebase please? This conflicts with #74.\n. Auto-merging this @elagin @nomwerp \n. I can't understand. Can you please improve issue description?\n. Implemented obd-java-api support in 0.10, https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/blob/e2a98f051407414edff5001097887446cfad8106/src/main/java/pt/lighthouselabs/obd/commands/protocol/AvailablePidsObdCommand.java.\nNot having more details on how to implement this in this project, I'm closing this.\n. I'm reviewing this and will merge tomorrow after testing.\n. @nomwerp can you squash the commits to a more clean commit log?\n. Thank you.\n. Need help!\n. I guess it never looked as prettier :D\n. Awesome! Thanks \n. @nomwerp we're ready to close this one, are we not?\n. Awesome! Thanks \n. Oh, so nice of you to actually get a new icon. It looks good :)\n. I have no idea.\n. Did you fix this with #83? If so, next time close it please.\n. You merged it and were waiting on complains? :-D\n. Sure. \n. @nomwerp damn, I should have asked for README.md changes but I guess I'll be doing it tomorrow. Can you take some screenshots of the app running on a moving car?\n. I'm open to improvements on the https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api project.\n. Awesome @anti43! \n. Different cars and ELM327 devices respond differently. It's sad but it's the reality. I'm open to any improvement that adds support for responses like this without breaking previous functionality.\n. @nomwerp would be nice to close some obj-java api issues, release 1.0 and update the dependency here as well, but I'm lacking the time to do it.\n. @nomwerp honestly, I never pushed the app to any app store. Probably, someone else did it. I've been notified about it in the past.\n. @nomwerp you are the expert here :D I'll leave that to you. I will be tagging RC1 in the coming days.\n. @nomwerp I know I've changed the packaging in the past because I no longer controlled the lighthouselabs.eu domain.  But right now, I don't even control the .pt as well, so I can probably rename stuff to com.github.pires.obdreader or something prettier.\n. Moved to com.github.pires.obd in 26cba74.\nTagging 2.0-RC1 now.\n. It is feasible. One would need to handle Bluetooth errors on https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/blob/master/src/main/java/pt/lighthouselabs/obd/reader/io/ObdGatewayService.java and play with the service lifecycle to act accordingly.\n. This is most probably due to the explicit delay in sending commands.\n. @vivek40 is there a PR coming?\n. Need logs please.\n. ELM327 is not connected. \n. > pt.lighthouselabs.obd.exceptions.UnableToConnectException: Error running 03, response: SEARCHING...UNABLETOCONNECT\nThis response comes from the ELM327 device.\n. Exactly! Thank you @nomwerp \n. Awesome! Thank you so much @amouly \n. @amouly now I do https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/issues/90. Do you have the time and will to take care of it? Would love to review a PR :+1: \n. Awesome! You rock.\n. @nomwerp @amouly can you update me on this, please?\n. Awesome!\n. Good question. Historical reasons! Feel free to propose any changes.\n. @amouly the code should be 2 spaces indent. The XML stuff could and should follow the same thing. This tree is quite old and a lot of stuff came from very old versions so I'm thankful you noticed it and can fix it.\nPlease, reformat to 2 spaces indent.\nAlso, when you're done and feel comfortable with the PR, please squash your commits into a more discernible log.\n. Refs #90 \n. I always use 2 spaces on my Java code, regardless of the specific framework I'm using, in this case Android.\n. @amouly unless you don't feel like contributing other stuff in the future, I'm ok with what you suggested.\nIf otherwise, and if you want to provide a PR first that formats code according to Android guidelines, and if @nomwerp agrees, I am OK to get it merged. But you must understand we need to trust it because reviewing will be overwhelming.\n. @nomwerp if you're happy, i'm happy with reformatting the code. I'll merge this and reformat code tomorrow.\n. You know IDEs allow you to configure indentation, right guys? Please, don't argue about ease of reading code, because I have a totally different opinion about many spaces. Two spaces is enough and the decision of going with four is just based on the fact that it seems it's Android guidelines.\nI will reformat the code later in the day.\nThank you.\n. Care to fill a PR? Will gladly review.\n. Thank you!! You're awesome. \n. Reviewing.\n. Thank you @Hippoish24 :)\n. I've never had any issues importing this project into Android Studio. Actually, Gradle Wrapper used to exist for people that didn't have Gradle installed which I don't believe is true when you install said IDE.\n. So if Android Studio creates the wrapper, what's the issue then?\n. Hmmm, current Android Studio complains about not having Gradle indeed. I wonder if they removed the bundled version... anyway one of the prerequisites in the doc is Gradle 2.2.1. Will mark this as an improvement rather than a bug and will take care of it ASAP. Thank you for reporting.\n. Actually, I revert what I just said, Gradle is bundled.\n$ ls /Applications/Android\\ Studio.app/Contents/gradle/gradle-2.2.1/bin/gradle*\n/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/gradle/gradle-2.2.1/bin/gradle\n/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/gradle/gradle-2.2.1/bin/gradle.bat\n. PR on its way.\n. @nomwerp I think it's related to proguard blocking roboguice stuff. Will look into it, thanks.\n. @amouly care to try it and let me know how it goes?\n. Nice! Thanks\n. @amouly care to try it and let me know?\n. Fixed @amouly? Been a couple years since I last used Proguard on Android.\n. Thank you for reporting and helping with the fix.\n. No and no. You have to do that code by yourself, but the most complicated part is already delivered by obd-java-api, which is to write/read from any channel (OutputStream and InputStream).\n. Where did you remove the 200ms? I'm not sure I follow what in script means. And polling time.\n. And please, stop comparing this to Torque. Torque is a closed app, paid by many users. This is not!\n. Thread.sleep(...) happens in obd-java-api as well, as a safe-measure. Change it, compile it and adapt your app at your own risk. It's the only way to bypass said safe-measure.\nRegarding Torque, it's a troubleshooting thing for misbehaving ELM 327 devices, not for comparing it to this open-source application.\n. Hi @MaxBenChrist! Thanks for contributing back. I am open to review your PRs and so far your issues are on pair with my personal guidelines.\n. People should be able to set whether they want to upload on WiFi connection only or not.\n. Awesome @MaxBenChrist! Bring it on :)\n. @nomwerp want to take care of that? Would be happy to merge. I'm traveling for a couple weeks and my availability for this is close to none.\n. Can you test RC3. Just released it but may take a while to sync to Maven Central.\n. Thank you. Will close this and wait for @anti43 feedback on https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/issues/34.\n. Thank you @MaxBenChrist!\n. @nomwerp any insight?\n. @mvglasow can you try latest code, please?\n. What's your car protocol? \n. Have you tried building the code? \n. You should try build and install the code. There's protocol nuances for some commands. \n. @valens254 anything to add? \n. @valens254 just to be sure it's clear, @mvglasow is running an old release of this software. I will try and make a new release, but I suggested him to compile the code.\nAlso @mvglasow, I'm not responsible for F-Droid releases or any other APK releases.\n. @mvglasow please test https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/releases/tag/2.0-RC3 and let us know. I'm closing this for now.\n. @mvglasow did you run the RC3?\n. You are correct. @mvglasow the app crashed? Can you provide logs?\n. @pho3nix90 care to develop further your comment? Is it an app thing? Library thing? I can provide a fix as well if I see some logs. \n. @pho3nix90 awesome! Thank you. \n. @mvglasow please try https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/releases/tag/2.0-RC4\n. Interesting!\n. @mvglasow care to try #155?\n. @mvglasow i'm also in favor if a dedup of code.\n. @mvglasow this was a really nice contribution. Thank you for that. And thank you for debugging this issue until a solution was found.\n. Good point here. The buffer processing stuff on the API changed a bit and it's a bit confusing, so I'd say that for now we should change how this app handles strings. I'm sorry for breaking this, but I can't pay as much attention as I want for the next two weeks :(\n. @MaxBenChrist just to be sure, this is optional and disabled by default, right?\n. Thank you, awesome!\n. @nomwerp is this to be merged or closed?\n. Any updates on this?\n. @nomwerp is this to be merged or closed?\n. @nomwerp is this to be merged or closed?\n. I'll release obd-java-api RC5 later today and upgrade the dependency version here.\n. See https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/commit/d5474dce0556d3eca1707a5b41033edbc0600c94. That should be the properly formatted VIN.\n. Calling @anti43 on this one.\n. Please, try the latest code. Closing this but will reopen if there's feedback about it not being fixed.\n. I've tried a lot of equations before and never worked out because engines are so different. I'm open to try out an implementation, though.\n. @Pho3niX90 awesome!\n. @Pho3niX90 when adding new commands to obd-java-api, please add more tests as well, please. I will be releasing 1.0-RC6 in a bit.\n. @Pho3niX90 unit-tests. Check obd-java-api/src/test/java. Even when using an IDE to build your stuff, it's a Maven project and you should use it to run tests and validate what you implement.\n. @Pho3niX90 can we close this?\n. Merged and updated to 1.0-RC5 version of dependency.\n. @Pho3niX90 you're rocking the place! Keep it up.\n. My suggestion is to use your own repos and let's list them over here. Single requirement is to follow the JSON structure I have implemented in obd-server and this app.\n. @Pho3niX90 is that a server? Been a while since I coded PHP but I do not see any REST related code but rather a PHP script that one can run in his terminal.\n. Yeah, I will change that no later than monday. @Pho3niX90 would you be so kind and wait until I've done it to reopen the PR?\n. @Pho3niX90 can you create a new PR with latest formatting style?\n. Nop. Idea may have screwed it. Will improve manually later. \n. For some stupid reason, Android Studio had loaded the now removed Eclipse formatting settings file. Fixed and closed.\n. Pending on new library release. \n. Thank you!\n. I will not remove roboguice in favor of more boilerplate code. \n. @Hippoish24 it's also helping a lot with service and AsyncTask lifecycle management. Again, this is a no-go for me unless something happens to how much Android code we need to handle this burden.\n. Dagger is much more complicated to use and I want to maintain the code simple for anyone to use. I don't see any added value for the user in this, since the application delivers what it's supposed to do.\nStill, I'm open to analyze a PR that replaces Roboguice with something that means more performance AND less code.\n. This is probably caused by the service not being able to reset/restart. \n. How was it fixed? \n. @Pho3niX90 care to add latest comment to documentation?\n. @matthiasblaesing very good insight actually. It's been a long time since I last worked on that code and at the time I didn't gave it much thought. I should have :+1:\nI'll be working on this.\n. @nomwerp @anti43 @MaxBenChrist @Pho3niX90 just letting you know (since you are the most active users around) that PUT has been replaced with POST. \n. But you haven't updated build.gradle to include the latest lib, did you?\n. @sytolk not sure what to do with this since I can't maintain two build tools.\n. I will accept this for now. Thank you.\n. @Pho3niX90 I am in favor of that solution instead of #138. Anyway, #138 is not ready for testing/merge.\n. @sytolk my comments on why PR #138 is not ready for merge are detailed there.\nRegarding plug-ins for logging, it's possible but probably too time-consuming for me right now.\n. Yes. I'm taking care of this, thank you. \n. 1.0-RC9 has been released with revert from Java 8 to 7 and a fix for the Windows platform.\n. Thanks for the PR @sytolk but I can't merge it.\nFirst of all, I don't want obd-java-api snapshot releases in the build. There's plenty snapshots that will break the build entirely.\nSecondly, the official build process is based on build.gradle and you haven't updated it there.\n. Please, keep the PR pointed at 1.0-RC9. I will release it as soon as https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/pull/62 is merged.\n. @sytolk 1.0-RC9 has been released.\n. You're missing build.gradle as well.\n. While it's important to you, it's not ready for generic usage. I'm sorry but this won't be merged as is.\n. @sytolk I understand laziness, I'm lazy too. But we need variables to be configurable. All of them have been detailed before.\nAlso, the commit log is a mess. Please meld your commits into a single one after rebasing current changes in master.\n. Please, provide PR :)\n. @sytolk please don't do it that way or I won't be able to validate the PR and merge.\n. We can aim higher, say API Level 14.\n. @Pho3niX90 the idea of broadcasting command results is interesting and my only recommendation is to use LocalBroadcastManager.\n. The app is small enough for us to think about plug-ins.\n. OBD Java API is pure Java so there's no way it will accept Android code.\nCan't we wrap ObdCommandresult in another object specific to this project that implements Parcelable?\n. I'll close this since you were the one suggesting it but no one has provided feedback or the will to pick it up.\nGood luck with your project. Thank you for all your contributions.\n. @Pho3niX90 care to open a PR addressing this issue? Glad to review it.\n. The thing with AT S0 is that I can't guarantee it to work with all ELM devices or that all programmers will send said command. But I can guarantee I remove all spaces, if any.\n. @sytolk @Pho3niX90 let's agree to disagree here.\nI am fine with native Android crash handling that sends logcat logs by email. I am also fine with adding Acra or any other external service that a user sees fit for the same purpose.\nWhat I'm not OK with, and both with this PR and #138 is the lack of configurability by the user.\nPlease, make all variables configurable, i.e. usernames, passwords, email destination addresses, service URLs and tokens, etc. Then, remove all references to other software you may have written before that is in no way related to Android OBD Reader app. And finally, meld (squash) your commits into a single one and I'll be ready to merge it.\n. @Pho3niX90 looks sharp. Now, I need to crash the app to test.\nMeanwhile, can you meld your commits into a single one? Thanks!\n. I need to add this to documentation. Thanks @filipeportes \n. Thank you very much @godfreyduke!\n. https://icculus.org/obdgpslogger/obdsim.html\n. Why don't you try it yourself?\n. Probably the phone is broken. There's little to nothing I can do to help here, I'm sorry.\n. Can you rebase this to a single commit and edit the message to it makes sense to anyone reading the commit log, please? If you can't do this, just let me know and I'll take care of it.\n. @Pho3niX90 thank you, it was squashed and merged.\n. @mvglasow awesome! Thank you @Pho3niX90.\n. Fixed by #156.\n. Fixes #111\nFixes #155\n. You need to follow GPL if you import or copy their code. There's no need for that. Thank you for the link. \n. Guess it depends on the size of the array.\n. Any logs related to the initial failure and the service failed binding?\n. @Pho3niX90 ok will close this until you find proof this doesn't work as expected.\n. What does this fix exactly? \n. @fscodesimone I'm not sure this fixes anything. Can someone else let me know what does this fixes exactly? Also, the code is not mergeable.\n. What is the impact of this change?\n. @Pho3niX90 thank you.\n. OK I will squash these commits into one and close the PR. Thank you @Pho3niX90 \n. Thank you @roalts \n. Interesting! Thank you for reporting, will look into it.\n. performCalculations is the culprit here.\njava\nprotected void performCalculations() {\n    // ignore first two bytes [hh hh] of the response\n    fuelRate = (buffer.get(2) * 256 + buffer.get(3)) * 0.05f;\n}\nThing is, why are there only 3 bytes when there should be 4? Could this be a protocol thing? I call in the master of multi-protocol support, @valens254.\n. @Kolyall I could do that, but then the result would need to be an exception since the standard is pretty adamant about the result calculations. In this case, with my tests - and it's working for others - one would need to ignore the first two bytes of the response, namely 41 5E which means response to 01 5E.\n. I'm not sure it can be a single byte response, but in case you're right it should be easy to implement. Want to open a PR in obd-java-api which fixes this? Please, don't forget to add unit-tests that assert your code works.\n. I can't understand what's going on with this output. Care to disclose the full stacktrace?\n. Commands may return exceptions. You need to handle them. In this case, the error seems to be related to the response to 01 1F which seems to be wrong.\nSince you're having so many issues, I'd say the protocol your car uses is mostly unsupported by obd-java-api library.\n@valens254 seems to be the multi-protocol expert around and he's probably the most fit to help here again.\n. @Pho3niX90 would this be a CAN thing too?\n. @valens254 again, can you help? This is something you've worked on.\n. A server side interface? You mean, implement MQTT client that publishes data to one MQTT broker?\n. Is that a server-side interface? Anyway, seems interesting and I'm open to review a PR.\n. :+1: thanks a lot for your contribution!\n. @ZKjellberg can you share at least one screenshot?\n. This is awesome, this app is needing a UI revamp/redesign for sure. Thank you a ton!\n. Closing for now. Will re-open if there's proof this doesn't work.\n. I'll be releasing library RC16 as soon as @Pho3niX90 finishes an open PR and will update this project.\n. Done.\n. I wish manufacturers would at least implement all standard PIDs. Thank you @Pho3niX90.\n. @jbits why don't you open a PR with a fix? Would be glad to merge.\n. Thank you @Pho3niX90 \n. Thank you @Pho3niX90 \n. What @Pho3niX90 said. This is a Bluetooth issue and not an app issue.\n. I will create similar issue in the API project.\n. Not sure this will fix it permanently. The fact that one queues the command doesn't mean it's executed instantaneously. Thoughts?\n. Fixes #176 \n. @phamels thanks for reporting. Care to open a PR that fixes this?\n. @jbits want to check this one out? ;-)\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. @Pho3niX90 always to the rescue, thanks man!\n. From the top of my head this makes sense. Is a PR coming? \n. Fixed by #189. Thanks @jbits.\n. If there's anything I've learned about OBD is that nothing is guaranteed. Good luck!\n. @diegomalone excellent job!\nAs a sidenote, this is pr-BR.\n. Nice catch, thanks!\n. The API (obd-java-api) used in this project allows you to send any command you desire. \n. OBD-II PIDs are not meant for that. You must consult your car manufacturer to get the proprietary commands to execute.\n. You should try different protocols since auto selection isn't working.\n. It's probably CAN stuff that is not well supported right now.\n. Please, go ahead. github.com/pires/obd-java-api is where it should be implemented.\n. Share here what you have and I'll take a look.\n. Just override fillBuffer or readRawData, depending on your needs.\n. This is not a library but an Android app. The library sits at https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api and there you can find the implementation of said command.. You can base your work in this https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/issues/147. But a github/google search would probably give you PHP code as well.. Why did you remove these if I've tested with them before?\n. Not sure why this info would appear in README.md...\n. Are you proposing a new icon?\n. This URL shouldn't have been merged. Please replace with default obd-server url.\n. Why 70?\n. Fuel consumption is not working unfortunately. We should remove this entirely from the app.\n. Why did you change the indent to 4 spaces instead of 2? Please revert that change.\n. Once again, due to indent size change I can't review the changes in this class.\nAlso, why the hell files are now mode 755?\n. This is meant to work with OBD Server. If you're adapting it, please keep those changes for yourself alone.\n. Fix indent size.\n. This should be reverted to false since many users won't have interest in uploading data.\n. Ah, interesting.\n. Sure!\n. Can you please use english for comments as well?\n. Good catch!\n. Remove these comments.\n. This should be configurable to provide this feature to other users.\n. This should be configurable and encrypted on device storage.\n. This must be configurable.\n. What is Hazmat?\n. hazmat?\n. Why leave this commented?\n. Why not reuse getString(R.string.text_bluetooth_disabled)?\n. Why did these went away?\n. Please, remove this email address. Otherwise, I may see my inbox filled with user logs.\n. This is not the way to do it, but Log.e.\n. ",

version is that? (looks a bit different from recent versions)\n. there doesn't seem to be a version released recently but current code is runable,\nif you don't use git you can download it here https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/archive/master.zip\ni've never tried to use eclips with android development but it seems a common thing to do :\nhttps://developer.android.com/tools/help/adt.html\n. hi, do you mean you want to build all the libraries from source too?\nhave a look here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16718026/how-to-build-an-android-library-with-android-studio-and-gradle\n. yeps, all works. i needed the protocol selection setting to be able  to try them all (unfortunately none of them seems better then AUTO, still issues )\n. I'll try to get my (OBD) communication issues sorted , looks pretty much the same as #40 , I'll add my finding there.  The changes  ( 21ac445  )  i made here help a bit with the diagnoses since it now prints the actual error for each command.\n. on a more technical note , how should we handle this?  of course any time speed is zero or very low you'll get a very high  (or infinite) fuel economy. easy enough to put in a if statement for zero or low speed but what to return in that case? my car will display \"--.-\" at low speed. is there any more high level code that expect it always returns a number or can we safely return a string?\n\nPaulo Pires notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@Hesamedin obd-java-apiis the actual OBD implementation.

SQL\nINSERT INTO `mytable` SET  `vin`='XXX', `SPEED`='0km/h', `ENGINE_RPM`='0 RPM', `INTAKE_MANIFOLD_PRESSURE`='0kPa', `ENGINE_LOAD`='0.0%', `longitude`=0, `latitude`=0\n. no, at the moment just always adding all supplied fields to table before inserting , definitely not the most elegant  or secure way\n. @elagin if we are going in the direction of storing data locally (#74) , shouldn't we rethink data upload? I'm thinking a synchronization between databases could be more appropriate\n. yes agreed\n. squash seems to have worked...\n. I guess it could make things pretty but it seems that android:Theme.Material requires API level 21 (current min is 10). since supposedly only 10% of devices use this is that something we want? or does it fall back gracefully? (although it might not install anymore)\nhttps://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html\n. to answer my own question:\nfrom main/res/values/styles.xml\n\"Theme customizations available in newer API levels can go in\n            res/values-vXX/styles.xml, while customizations related to\n            backward-compatibility can go here.\"\n. just applying the theme and deleting the background colours in favour of the defaults doesn't even look too bad: \n\n. commit 8bebec600e  (still  looks as ugly as always on older versions )\nbut I'll play around for a bit with the new theme...\n. Theme.Material.Light looks better in my opinion: \n\nnomwerp/android-obd-reader@0a8bc8c806\nI'm having trouble getting the fancy shadows to show up , setting elevation works in the preview but not on device\n. where would be a good place to put the .svg?  my best bet is directly in src/main/res \n. well if no complaints about the new icons i'd be happy to close...\n. TODO: update README.md too\n. @pires : happy to go to targetSdkVersion 21 ? \n. hmmm it could be that the \"CONNECTING\"  in the response is causing some confusion , had  a similar issue with device returning \"SEARCHING...\"  in front of the first response.\nif that is the case a crude fix could be to strip it from the response in  https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/blob/master/src/main/java/pt/lighthouselabs/obd/commands/ObdCommand.java at the end of readRawData() add something like: \n    rawData = rawData.replace(\"SEARCHING...\", \"\");\n. try with only a couple of OBD commands selected in the preferences, i've found that if you ask for one that is not supported you might be left with \"unable to connect\" until the next reset \n. it seems that for me having the (additional) \"Reset OBD\" enabled in settings results in \"UNABLE TO CONNECT\" for all following commands\n. ok just tested it and it is indeed the extra reset command that screws things up, I had it disabled in my preferences because one of the commands was causing issues but hadn't narrowed down to the extra reset.  i think the issue is that calling reset without the other init commands leaves it in a non working state.  anyway i removed if from the list of commands to run : commit e1a7a8776dcecafec2e69fb939f7c8e472911f65\nbut back to your original issue , did you solve that ?\n. without the extra reset that stopped everything doesn't it just fail on the first command (there is a temperature command hard coding in for this purpose just after all the init stuff) and continue happily after that?\n. alright, i'll have a look but there don't seem to be (m)any open issues that affect android-obd-reader.  \nI think it'd also be good to do a bit more work on the UI before calling it 2.0\nf-droid doesn't seem to be auto updating anyway , last build there is from 2013, what needs to happen to get that to work again?\n. ok i'll investigate , seems that we'd need to make an update of : \nhttps://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/blob/master/metadata/eu.lighthouselabs.obd.reader.txt\nI might create a 2.0-expermintal or so to test if f-droid can actually build it from source\n. managed to have a local copy of f-droid build it from source successfully, only thing we need to add to f-droid metadata is another build:\nBuild:2.0,11\n    commit=826dd9737\n    gradle=yes\n...where commit is now just the latest commit but can also be a tag when we actually release a 2.0\nthere is one issue: at f-droid the app is listed as eu.lighthouselabs.obd.reader instead of pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader so we'd have to add it as a new app or possibly rename the existing, or maybe tell f-droid to ignore this issue\n. do you know the history behind the name change? \n. OK great,   when I'm back home I'll make a pull request for the fdroid people with the name change and to set it to auto update based on the tags.\n. i think @pires means that the  ELM327 is unable to connect to the car? e.g. the car is not responding because it is not running/powered  or the appropriate init and reset commands haven't been issued \n. did you try it with the engine running?\n. i think that's all strings in the UI, @amouly would you mind to do some more translation to spanish?\n. yeah i'm afraid that the changes i did in  19fa27811ebb0b19147f4a2e077334689d820706 are causing the conflict,  could i ask you to prepare a pull request just for the changes you made in src/main/res/values-es/strings.xml  and  src/main/res/values/strings.xml ?  and I'll work work out what those strings are called now afterwards.  thanks.\n. actually, that seems to be right place: \"You must save the XML file in the res/xml/ directory.\"\nhttps://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings.html#DefiningPrefs\n. i'm happy to have this merged , i've build @amouly  's fork and looks good (in english at least ;) the diff here on github is actually smart enough to show both the real changes behind the formatting changes.\nmaybe a way ahead for now is the have all the xml formatted with 4 spaces and the keep the java code with 2 until we figure out what we want? I'd be happy to go the 4 spaces since it seems that would make it so much easier for people to contribute to this project (i know it shouldn't make a difference but still)\n. in  obd-java-api/src/main/java/pt/lighthouselabs/obd/commands/ObdCommand.java\njava\n    /*\n     * HACK GOLDEN HAMMER ahead!!\n     * \n     * Due to the time that some systems may take to respond, let's give it\n     * 200ms.\n     */\n    Thread.sleep(200);\n. you can clone obd-java-api it into your project folder:\ngit clone https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api.git\ncreate obd-java-api/build.gradle with something like\napply plugin: 'java'\nin main build.gradle change \n compile 'pt.lighthouselabs.obd:obd-java-api:0.8' \nto\n compile project(':obd-java-api')\nin settings.gradle add include ':obd-java-api'\nthat should do it\n. we're on f-droid again with the new package name:\nhttps://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.github.pires.obd.reader\nnote that for auto update to work in the future the tag name and android:versionName in the manifest must be absolutely identical (2.0-rc1 vs 2.0-RC1 ). \nfor reference, any future modifications of the fdroid metadata can be made here: https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/blob/master/metadata/com.github.pires.obd.reader.txt\n.

Thanks!  this fixes #127\n. i think the imports are missing?\n. ...especially not to someone else's server (http://wesenseit-vm1.shef.ac.uk ;)\n. this is the key part\n. was this intended, it seems to revert a recent commit?\n.

    "Pho3niX90": "Works on one of my vehicles. \n. Accelerometer wont be needed for proper fuel consumption. I have already made pull requests. The method will be to see how much fuel is actually injected and then calculate the fuel being burned. Most vehicles do have trims to actually show how the afr is being changed (example. Going uphil, going WOT ect)\n. Just as a note.\nCompared to Torque, torque polls double the sensors in half the time\n. Excuse me but your troubleshooting method in the readme states to compare and test in torque as well. \nCode removed was\n/*\n * HACK GOLDEN HAMMER ahead!!\n * \n * Due to the time that some systems may take to respond, let's give it\n * 200ms.\n */\nThread.sleep(200);\n. Has anyone started on this? This should be relatively easy to do.\n. I have fixed this issue in my version. The issue was that it crashes when there are no errors found. I will see if I can incorporate my fix with this.\n. @pires is an app issue. I will provide a fix in the next 30mins. \n. Try this: https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/pull/153\n. @mvglasow are you able to read any other data? Have you conpletely restrted your phone and then ONLY tried reading dtc without clicking on start live data?\n. Try #155, that should work if it is in fact your issue\n. An issue that I noticed throughout the project is that layout files referring to \"dimen\" resources that do not exist. Am I the only one that has this issue?\n. I made some changes to the files to prevent the overlap of text. I hope I did it correctly in github for you to see\n. Sorry I redid it. There are 2 file changes.\n. \n. Only diff is I have the altitude in the gps as well. My data is emulated with obdsim\n. Awesome. I will test that and revert back\n. This is working like a charm now. \n. I tried it on my 750 today and it couldn't properly pick up the vin, instead it returned \"IWIBLI82I61I1\". \n. Yes I am using the correct version. This is working on the one car but not the other. \n. I haven't tested. Which obd terminal do you suggest\n. I added the headers command and that solved it. Thank you.\n. That solution just yields hex code returned\n. I have implemented your solution, vin now comes back IIBSI92I0JI68\n. Please ignore the above. Just noticed this is on an E46 m3. I am testing the app on a fleet of BMWs \n. So it has creeped up again with another car. IWIBCI38I05I5\n. I have started implementing this into my version. Sadly I can only test with the car since obdsim only allows limited readings. If all goes according to plan I should have this working this week.\n. So I have started this. Need to test on multiple vehicles though first.\nFor the time being I have made the pull request for everyone to test the 2 different AFRs as it is crucial to the consumption\nhttps://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/pull/55 \nhttps://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/pull/129\nIf you guys can provide me feedback on which one works the best and actually returns an AFR reading, the AFR, or AFR wide. Also provide your vehicle details if possible. \nAlso let me know if the MAP/MAF reading is working for you\n. @pires Which tests are you referring to?  Never mind. I will add it in my todo next time. \n. Dependent on ResetTroubleCodes.java\n. Not to worry. It is published all over the web. There are hundreds of websites that have the descriptions for trouble codes.\n. http://engine-codes.com/\n. But as far as I know the trouble codes are all based of the OBD2 standard. \nhttp://www.obd-codes.com/trouble_codes/\nhttp://www.dmv.de.gov/services/Vehicle_Services/dtc_list.pdf\nhttp://www.outilsobdfacile.com/data-trouble-code-obd2.php\n. Here is the pull request for the java part: https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/pull/51\nHere are screenshots, emulated data:\n\n\n\n. I added altitude as well. It is useful for calculating altitude HP loss, which I will add later. \n. Yes that would be the ideal solution. There is a class that checks the supported PIDs, when a session is started it would be good to run this first and store the PID's with the vin, so next time it knows what can be polled and what can't. \n. I will try to add the feature, I am craving for faster data \n. Here you go. https://github.com/Pho3niX90/OBD2-SERVER\nIts extremely simple, just add credentials and it will automatically create the database and add the new columns, if new readings gets added it will automatically create the new columns as well. \n. @pires yes it is a server. That's the end url, have been running it. \nThe brilliant part about it is that it automatically creates the tables and fields as required, so maintenance on it is null\n. Done\n. I think it might be android studio that forces it 4 indents. Also the file was cleaned and reorganised.  Main part that was changed is at the  support check, just search for .apply () or .commit ()\n. Okay I have tried everything now. Changed android studio to 2 lines, selected 2 indents straight in github as well. \n. Think 4 is the best to use. Reason being that all ide's do that, or suggest that. Even github understands code with 4 indents and even stackoverflow\n. @pires Yes sure I will wait\n. It's this:\n<string name=\"action_clear_codes\">Clear Codes</string>\nAnd obdreadings fix is \nhttps://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/pull/125/files\n. @nomwerp okay thats perfect\n. @Hippoish24 http://developer.android.com/training/articles/memory.html#DependencyInjection\nIf you really need to use a framework I would say use http://google.github.io/dagger/\n. The car was stationary. So non of those readings are correct.\n. Here is a screenshot from terminal\n\n. Fixed it.\n. Seems that it isn't fixed. What I can gather is that for some dongles echo doesn't always turn off. \n. @sytolk You are receiving echos. Some adapters require you to turn on echo and then off twice. Give that a try.\n. @sytolk also make sure headers are off\n. @sytolk they are sent to turn of by default. But I have noticed on some dongles they need to be turned on and then off to correctly work. \n. Awesome thanks. Haven't been active in a while. \n. I have implemented something similar but in native android development. It creates a log file and asks the user if the log should be mailed. \n. True. But acra is another library that needs to be taken into consideration when compiling. I agree that only developers needs logs, that's why you might as well use android native code and send a complete logcat to the developer. \nSee here -> https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/pull/144\nUnless acra picks up beter logs than the native android system that I am not aware of ?\n. I agree. Although, not having a local broadcoast could allow for future plugin development? To keep the core app small and individuals install plugins?\n. Okay I have implemented this in my app. One issue though. \nObdCommand.java needs to implement Parcelable.\nThis is so that all activities receive the full package to call the methods as required. A workaround that I can think of now is to only send the formatted result which isn't ideal. \n. @pires that will be a better solution. I will have a look into it.\n. Hi. \nI can't continue with this one. My project has dramatically changed and submitting PR's from it will just be catastrophic.\nThis is also a fairly simple change that I have already implemented in my project. However, I am not sure how you will get around not editing the java, maybe you should write a separate version of ObdCommand.java for this project?\nI have to say this is the best change that can be made. After doing this I was able to bring my project to live by adding extra activities and having gauges in some of them. \n. Sure stuff. Just need to review and test first, I have already added the spaces command to my project, still need to remove the redundant code. \n. Need this first: https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/pull/68\n. Hi. \nI can't continue with this one. My project has dramatically changed and submitting PR's from it will just be catastrophic. However this change is very simple and will see if I can get some time to do it. For now I am closing.\n. That makes complete sense.\n. @sytolk What exactly more do you need than a complete logcat + device information + android info?\n. @sytolk Okay let me rephrase myself. This gives you a complete log for the application, that includes debug message, error messages and info messages.\n. @sytolk If you do not write new code how are you a developer? I do not understand?\n@pires I have changed the name from my test app to the correct \"OBD2 Reader\". \nWhat do you suggest around the email address? This should be the main developers email address, but give the end user the option to change that address?\n. @pires  Is this sufficient? \n. wrong git\n. @pires I have no idea how to rebase. I made changes in browser. \n. Here is the full list, http://www.obd-codes.com/trouble_codes/\nHowever, most DTC are brand specific and descriptions change. \n. @mvglasow That is an interesting read and never knew that. I did have reference to an opensource db somewhere. I know we have discussed this in another issue somewhere, but since the trouble codes are law they are very generic and should follow a principle and guideline.\nHere are more: http://www.nology.com/OBD2FaultCodes.htm\nAnd another without any copyright notice: http://www.dtcsearch.com/\n. I am busy populating a DB. Question is should this be kept in an Array (For easy translation). Or a sqlite db that cannot be translated. \n. It will be 3 arrays, the key (code), the description and the make. Each being 7919rows.\nI will create the pull request. \n. @mvglasow I also prefer a DB. But realistically people that will be translating will most probably not have the apps to open up a db and edit it.  On commits you also will not have the ability to see what actually changed. And the extra programming might be a pita and will require a lot of testing to make sure it doesn't cause issues with special characters. \n. No nothing. With my debugging it just doesn't happen, but no error logs. I am trying to figure out why the service doesn't bind / recreate unless the app gets a proper restart\n. @pires I am busy testing the performance. \n. @pires fixed some typos. Tested the performance and it's beyond perfect, no delays at all.\nHowever, I did pick up a separate error unrelated to this though. It seem that if there are more than 9 errors it starts acting  out. Might be due to the increased frames beyond 9 \n. @Kolyall Can you please instead of using the calculated results, publish the rawData respons? This will explain what is going on\n. @pires I think this is purely a protocol that is not supported by the vehicle. \n@Kolyall Which vehicle are you testing on and which year model? If I am correct this is not crashing the app, but just throwing the stacktrace? Thus far I have only seen 1 car that supports fuel level, and non that supports run-time (accurately). \n. Have you tried the latests version of the app? This should have been fixed in a previous PR. \n. This is still an issue on my side as well. I am prepared to put up a $10 reward for a proper fix for the VIN. \n. For all that are having this issue, please post your rawData vin here. I need to see what vins are being returned so that I can figure out one algorithm.\n. @kirbyjames\nCould you please post your raw response from the obd. So that I can do tests?\n. @KirbyJames Pleaes try this project: http://goo.gl/uAcCK3\nReplace the result string with your raw response. See if it's giving you the correct output\n. @KirbyJames I will need your rawData response to rrsolve. \n. in calculated results. Instead of returning vin return rawData\n. @KirbyJames \nPlease add the following in you vin data\nLog.d(\"VinCommand.java\", \"rawdata: \" + rawData);\nLike so:\n\nThen find the raw response in your logcat. \n. @KirbyJames I have no idea to be honest. I have completely moved away from gradle. \n@Pires do you know the answer to the above question?\n. @KirbyJames Awesome news! What vehicle was it used in, which country and what year model is the vehicle? This will help greatly in diagnosing further enchancements to the VIN. \n. Then it's most def a can. on same restriction as we here in south africa are, except no emissions. \nAnyways, yes the changes will be added to the lib, pullrequest is located here -> https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/pull/113 \n. HI, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs\nYou will have to hack the canbus to achieve what  you need, not part of this project. \n. @jbits could you please elaborate on the issue? \n. You are either selecting the incorrect device to connect to, or the device is faulty. \n. @yangwuan55 care to share what the problem was?\n. Yes perfect thank you\n. @pires yes that is correct, I am currently looking into other more elegant avenues to fix it. This is just a quick fix. \n. 1. This is because OBD2 protocol is not lightning fast, there will always be a delay based on the ECU of your vehicle + OBD2 adapter being used. \n2. As for distance traveled, is your GPS working? \n. @kaorijp if you do not like that it uses GPS to get accurate distance traveled as opposed to a OBD2 PID that is unreliable then I suggest you modify it to your liking. \nAs for speed issues, the app by default polls ALL sensors and will slow down individual PIDs. So turn off all sensors that you are not interested in.  The app you mentioned does not poll more than 3 to 4 sensors at a time I assume. \n. @sytolk It's available, but I have never gotten anything reliable or remotely accurate from it. The thing is all mobile devices today have a proper built in GPS to properly calculate the distance traveled. Being a business intelligence developer by trade I always opt for the most accurate data possible. \n@pires always a pleasure\n. @bitaromulus that is incompatibility. You are seeing can responses. I am busy working on getting can to work, however my vehicle's do not respond in can so it's taking longer than expected. \nCould you please post more raw responses along with what the value should be (roughly).\n. @kaorijp could you please post your raw responses?\n. @kaorijp Distance MIL is not distance traveled, it's distance traveled with MIL light on.\n. @bitaromulus thank you for the examples you have posted. \nMy pc crashes and need to resetup everything from scratch again. Once I have done that I will work on a solution for the can messages.  I will look into acquiring the ecusim as well for the multiprotocol development. Currently I use win-obdsim for testing but only supports kline messages. \n. @bitaromulus \nCould you please post example of these mods\n29 bit / Fast Init + 500kbps\n11 bit / 5 Baud Init + either 500 kbps or 250 kbps\nWith 2 raw examples of each knob, for each protocol above? That would be a considerable help to improve the library @ https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/issues/115\n. @kaorijp no it doesn't have such a function. Only distance travelled with MIL on, and since codes cleared. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs\n. @kaorijp What are you trying to achieve?\n. @kaorijp Then there is no pid for you. 31 has a max value it will display and does not get reset on each trip. 31 is distance travelled after the last time errors were cleared. And it's not supported by most vehicles as far as I have seen\n. @sytolk There is no generic PID for this. Therefore not possible in this project. You will have yo run a sniffer on your vehicles network to find it. But this is different per brand and per model. I personally do not see a need for this so cannot assist in persuing it when the gps works flawlessly. \n. @kaorijp My only suggestion to what you want to achieve is monitor the cars speed over the session time and calculate the distance. \n.

The reader seems to work as I can connect with my laptop, but never got it to work with my phone.\nJust tried on Android 4.3 (Cyanogenmod 10.2RC1) and got a different picture than before. RFCOMM supposedly works in 4.3 (though I don't have any app to verify this).

Apparently, Bluedroid is pickier about call parameters than Bluez was. My suspicion is that OBD II Reader is doing some operation that Bluedroid doesn't like (but which Bluez would handle).\nI see three errors in the log, which might have to do with it:\n- the assert error (which seems to be a log entry from the Bluetooth stack itself - if it's related to the app, it might be a parameter issue)\n- bt-rfcomm: PORT_DataInd, p_port:0x53974948, p_data_co_callback is null (there is an earlier warning about a missing BluetoothManagerCallback, which may be related)\n- bt-btif: DISCOVERY_COMP_EVT, failed to find channel (surrounded by two warnings)\n2696 seems to be the ODB II Reader process, 860 appears to be a Bluetooth-related system service. (I tested two apps and got PID 860 in the logs for both apps.)\nSomething still isn't right, but at this point I can't tell whether the fault lies in the app or in Android. I have another app, iTLogger (also on F-Droid), which suffers from the same issue and still doesn't work on CM10.2RC1. Errors in the log look very similar.\n. Tried today with 2.0-RC2, still no luck. OS is now Android 5.1.1.\n. Where can I find that out? The car is a 2005 Audi A4 (B7 model).\n. No, so far I've only used the APKs on F-Droid.\n. A question, though: how come live data works while DTC doesn't? I thought the underlying protocol is the same for both \u2013 or am I wrong?\n. Same symptoms here, too: I can collect live data but when I try to get DTC, it says \"Unable to connect to Bluetooth device\". The error message indicates the error happens lower down in the stack \u2013 or the app is giving out a misleading error message.\nAs for F-Droid: for most apps they simply build an APK from the repo. Thus, apart from the signature, there is no difference between an F-Droid build, a version I have built myself and (presumably) a release build on github. They may occasionally patch apps to remove advertising or non-free dependencies, but they try to limit this to a few exceptional cases because they lack the resources to do such adaptations.\n. Yes, downloaded from https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/releases/download/2.0-RC3/android-obd-reader-debug.apk. The app shows as RC2 in the package manager, but that is presumably due to https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/blob/2.0-RC3/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L6.\n. @pires OK, will try. Just to clarify: the app does not crash, it simply displays a toast with an error message.\n. Same issue with RC4. When I try to read DTC, all I get is a toast saying \"unable to connect to Bluetooth device\".\nLogcat is attached. Since at the same time Android was syncing my phone book and dumping all its contents to the log, I've filtered for com.github.pires. If you need other data, let me know.\nalogcat.2015-12-21-15-22-32+0100.filtered.txt\n. @pires I have a suspicion what it might be: LiveData and DTC define their own methods to connect to the OBD dongle, and implementations differ.\nCompare ObdGatewayService (live data):\nhttps://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/blob/2.0-RC4/src/main/java/com/github/pires/obd/reader/io/ObdGatewayService.java#L138\nand DTC:\nhttps://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/blob/2.0-RC4/src/main/java/com/github/pires/obd/reader/activity/TroubleCodesActivity.java#L295\nObdGatewayService has a workaround for certain Bluetooth connection issues, which is missing for DTC. Unfortunately my logcat got cut off at the start, so I can't tell for sure if live data relies on the fallback on my phone, but it's probably a good idea to implement the fallback in DTC as well.\n. @Pho3niX90 see above \u2013 yes, live data works. Didn't try restarting, though. My test cycle was:\n- Upgrade\n- Start live data \u2013 works.\n- Stop live data.\n- Get DTC \u2013 error.\n- Start live data \u2013 works.\n- Stop live data.\n- Get DTC \u2013 error.\nCurrently my suspicion is that it's a low-level issue and that my phone requires the hack in ObdGatewayService to get anything out of the dongle at all, and DTC won't work because it's lacking the fallback machanism.\n. I've just built it myself and implemented a fix, which is functionally equivalent to #155. In fact it works now. I'll just clean up the code to make it a bit more modular (duplicate code isn't very nice) and then send you a merge request.\n. Just built and tested successfully (live data and DTC work).\nI've introduced a new class, io.BluetoothManager, to take the new method, because I didn't find any other class that looked appropriate for this. If you have a better idea (you certainly know the code better than I do), feel free to refactor.\n. as stated in #111, please hold it back for a while, as I have a similar fix, which de-duplicates some code. Coming soon...\n. @Pho3niX90 This is a really great resource! Unfortunately the bottom of the page states that all information on the page is strictly copyrighted, so we probably won't be able to just siphon off their data and feed it into the tool. They do permit linking, though \u2013 we could have each DTC open a link to their site (http://www.obd-codes.com/$DTC, replacing $DTC with the respective code).\nAs for brand-specific DTCs: obd-codes.com states that, of the P codes, only those beginning with P1 are manufacturer-specific. The same seems to be true for the C codes (the C0 codes appear to be generic, and they have a list of GM-specific codes starting with C1) and also of the U codes. The have no information on manufacturer-specific B codes, and all the codes they have start with B0. I'd suspect that, as with the others, any manufacturer-specific B codes would also start with B1.\nThe OpenOBD db has manufacturer and model fields but currently they are all set to \"Generic\".\nAbout descriptions changing \u2013 different implementations may use different wordings, as in:\nP0441 Tank Venting System Function (Android OBD-II Reader)\nP0441 Evaporative Emission System Incorrect Purge Flow (OpenOBD)\nP0441 Evaporative Emission Control System Incorrect Purge Flow (obd-codes.com)\nHowever, these are all referring to the same thing, with some descriptions being a bit more specific than others. But I'd expect the meaning of the codes to be stable \u2013 at least for the generic codes (other than B1, C1, P1, U1). Or do you have examples where the meaning changed?\n. @Pho3niX90 If it's not too late: a Sqlite DB could be translated as well if we included an extra column for language. The search key would then be DTC, make and language. The language field could be null for English descriptions, with some logic to fall back to that if no description is found in the current UI language.\nIt would take some extra coding: we'd initially need to determine the UI language. Then, on each lookup, we'd look for entries in that language, and if no result is found, repeat the search for the default language.\nOn the long run, I think a database is easier to maintain than a set of arrays.\n.

Hello @karthickck. From what I can see from your stacktrace you are using the MockObdGatewayService and not the real one. This means that you hadn't been successfully connected to your OBD bluetooth device. Is this what you actually intented? The MockObdGatewayService is there mainly to allow developing without a real OBD device, thus it has not been thoroughly tested with every possible command.\n. If you want MockObdGatewayService to return diffent values then you can change the line that contains \"41 00 00 00\" in the executeQueue method of MockObdGatewayService (I am on vacation, using a mobile device thus cannot answer properly).\nIt would be great if extra functionality could be implemented onto MockObdGatewayService that would return valid values depending on the PID and not always 0.\n. No problem! I will verify it when I return from my vacation (after\nseptember 1st) however I can only test it with MockOdbGatewayService -- it\nis very difficult for me to test with actual OBD devices :(\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 21 \u0391\u03c5\u03b3 2014 5:24 \u03bc.\u03bc., \u03bf \u03c7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \"KarthickCk\" notifications@github.com\n\u03ad\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c8\u03b5:\n\nReally thanks for your immediate response,it would be great if you verify\nthe fuel type command in Obdgateway service.Once again thanks a lot.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/issues/37#issuecomment-52926800\n.\n. Hello @KarthickCk ,\nI was able to take a look at the issue. It seems that the problem was with the included obd-java-api library (https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api). \n\nThe exception is thrown because the FuelType your vehicle returns is not included in the FuelType enumaration (https://github.com/spapas/obd-java-api/blob/master/src/main/java/pt/lighthouselabs/obd/enums/FuelType.java). I submitted a patch (https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api/pull/22) that checks for the NullPointerException and returns \"-\" instead of letting it propagate. However I believe that a better fix would be to find out why your vehicle returns a Fuel type that is not on the discussed list.\nIn any case, I don't know when my patch will be merged or when the patched version of obd-java-api will be included to the maven repository. If you want to use the patch, just get the patched version of obd-java-api and run mvn clean install. A .jar file will be created in the target directory. Copy the full path of that .jar file. After that, go to the build.gradle file of android-obd-reader and change line \ncompile 'pt.lighthouselabs.obd:obd-java-api:0.6'\nto\ncompile files('/Users/serafeim/progr/java/obd-java-api/target/obd-java-api-0.7-SNAPSHOT.jar')\nIt then should no longer throw the exception (but you will see a \"-\" for the fuel type).\n. Hello @garvgarg. The ObdCommand class (and various others) belong to obd-java-api (https://github.com/pires/obd-java-api) as you can see in the line compile 'pt.lighthouselabs.obd:obd-java-api:0.7' of the file build.gradle\n.

If it does not, then proper DTC parsing will depend if it's a CAN, or ISO response.  If it's CAN, then the first byte (after the header-type 43/47 first byte) is for how many DTC there are.  For ISO, the DTC code bytes are sent right away, but in frames with checksums under some conditions.  I'm trying to create an algorithm on how to correctly parse, but if I'm understanding the documentation correctly, the current code definitely needs quite a bit of work.  We might even need to know the protocol if it will help make the algorithm cleaner.  Of course, I could be wrong if someone can guide me on how to properly fix.\n. ",

    "fabcira": "done. uploaded changes\n. Hi Paulo,\nI have spent several hours on this now and I am baffled. It seems to be a problem on the low level communication with the OBD reader. I have even replaced my bluetooth obd reader to be sure that it was not a hardware issue. \nI have now run the app with as job just the speed command and put some trace printouts in the ObdCommand.java methods.  These should be self explanatory: I put trace printouts in the method readRawData before and after the trimming, one in the method fillBuffer, and one in perform calculations of the speed command, etc. I attach the java file. \nAs you will see at some point the results start being corrupted. I can see a \"NNECTED\" returned at some point (should that be CONNECTED?). At the end of the trace you can clearly see a speed of 49km/h. The car was static. \nI am really not familiar with this low level programming so I guess I cannot help. \nAny idea?\nthanks\nFabio\n09-10 18:25:17.269  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/OpenGLRenderer\ufe55 Enabling debug mode 0\n09-10 18:25:19.391  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/AbsListView\ufe55 Get MotionRecognitionManager\n09-10 18:25:19.722  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/AbsListView\ufe55 unregisterIRListener() is called\n09-10 18:25:19.792  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/AbsListView\ufe55 unregisterIRListener() is called\n09-10 18:25:19.792  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/AbsListView\ufe55 unregisterIRListener() is called\n09-10 18:25:19.852  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/AbsListView\ufe55 unregisterIRListener() is called\n09-10 18:25:23.525  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/AbsListView\ufe55 onDetachedFromWindow\n09-10 18:25:23.525  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/AbsListView\ufe55 unregisterIRListener() is called\n09-10 18:25:23.595  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/BluetoothUtils\ufe55 isSocketAllowedBySecurityPolicy start : device null\n09-10 18:25:23.595  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader W/BluetoothAdapter\ufe55 getBluetoothService() called with no BluetoothManagerCallback\n09-10 18:25:23.595  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader D/BluetoothSocket\ufe55 connect(), SocketState: INIT, mPfd: {ParcelFileDescriptor: FileDescriptor[59]}\n09-10 18:25:24.066  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader E/ViewRootImpl\ufe55 sendUserActionEvent() mView == null\n09-10 18:25:24.066  30537-30537/pt.lighthouselabs.obd.reader I/Choreographer\ufe55 Skipped 30 frames!

One additional piece of information. The version I had downloaded before the summer did not have this issue. Is it possible that some changes have been inserted during the summer that influence this? I cannot find any relevant changes in the history but you never know. \n. One last note on this. I spent another couple of hours on this and I have found out (probably not surprisingly) that this happens when the reset command (and the rest of the initialisation) is either not sent by the app or received by the OBD Bluetooth reader. In this case the results are random. \nI could not identify why this happens: if it is just chance or if it is a structural problem. In any case it needs some fix (e.g. by double checking that if the init does not work it is repeated. \nI am reporting this in case anyone else has time to look into this, as I am unlikely to be able to do anything over the next several weeks. \n. I will try. Not sure however that is the cause. \nI have actually halved the sleep time in the old version (the one that does not present the issue) and driven for over 200 miles yesterday it worked just fine. \nI agree on being a big pain.\n. Yes I have done some further investigation and found something. I have realised (quite by chance) that there is one specific moment when you get the random results: when you turn off the engine and turn off the power but do not remove the key, the OBD dongle sends random values. I am unsure of why although I have an intuition that this is related to an imperfect switching off of the power (some functions are still active when the key is in, e.g the lights are kept on). \nAnyway I did an extensive test when I visited a friend. We drove for about 200km and I regularly tested the speed and rpm against the ones shown on the dashboard. They were all right. However when we stopped for petrol and my friend went to pay, I started getting random values. Speed went to 100km/h, rpm to 4000, etc.\nI hope it helps\n. apologies that was a change I did for a test and I left it by mistake]Of course I do not wnt anyone to upload their data to my server!\nf\nProf Fabio Ciravegna, \nProfessor of Language and Knowledge Technologies, \nDepartment of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield,\nRegent Court, 211 Portobello, S1 4DP, Sheffield, UK\nTel: +44(0)1142221940, Fax: +44(0)1142221810\nwww: http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/People/F.Ciravegna/ \n\nOn 16 Dec 2014, at 17:47, nomwerp notifications@github.com wrote:\nIn src/main/res/xml/preferences.xml https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/pull/38#discussion-diff-21916743:\n\n@@ -11,19 +11,20 @@\n       android:summaryOff=\"Disable http data upload\"\n       android:summaryOn=\"Enable http data upload\"\n       android:dialogTitle=\"Enable Data Upload\"\n-      android:enabled=\"false\"/>\n-      android:enabled=\"true\"/>\n  ...especially not to someone else's server (http://wesenseit-vm1.shef.ac.uk ;)\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/pull/38/files#r21916743.\n.

I can't understand why there is different types of indentation all over the app. I mean, on Layouts the indentation it's different from the Java code.\n. @pires Thanks for your feedback. Anyway, just asking, why are you using 2 spaces for indent? The common thing on android it's using 4 spaces for indentation. This is on the Android Developer Guidelines too:\n\nUse Spaces for Indentation\n- We use 4 space indents for blocks. We never use tabs. When in doubt, be consistent with code around you.\nhttps://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#use-spaces-for-indentation\n. That's a shame :(. Well, i'm going to do my changes on my fork, but following the Android guidelines. Then you can extract just the strings. Thanks for this project!\n. @pires yes, it's understandable. Anyway, this thing about format can be easily done with Android Studio. You have and option there: Code -> Reformat code... That option organize the code based on the default config for Android, and make a log with the changes.\n. @pires awesome! Well, I made some reformatting on my fork, if you want you can compare it here to see the changes. I'm not creating the PR because there is a lot of lines changed (but not deleted code). I added most of the Dialog strings to the \"strings.xml\", we can merge that later.\nI agreed with @nomwerp, having the code based on the guidelines would make easier to read, and maybe makes more people feel comfortable to contribute ;).\n. No, Android Stusio only have the Gradle Plugin, but not Gradle itself. I\nhaven't got it installed, I just have AS and it creates the wrapper for\neach project. It's a common issue when you import a project, not having\nGradle or the Wrapper and nothing works :P.\nOn Jun 7, 2015 17:45, \"Paulo Pires\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI've never had any issues importing this project into Android Studio.\nActually, Gradle Wrapper used to exist for people that didn't have Gradle\ninstalled which I don't believe is true when you install said IDE.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/issues/96#issuecomment-109798469\n.\n. No, AS just created it when you start the project from 0, but not when you\nimport it. When so, AS ask where the wrapper is, or where Gradle is, but if\nyou haven't got anyone, you can't run the project. The solution is copy the\nwrapper from another project and paste it on the current project.\nOn Jun 7, 2015 17:49, \"Paulo Pires\" notifications@github.com wrote:\nSo if Android Studio creates the wrapper, what's the issue then?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/issues/96#issuecomment-109798690\n.\n. Yeah sure. Maybe if you commit and push the wrapper it just works. If you\nwant to add it to another branch, I can test importing the project from 0.\nThanks.\nOn Jun 7, 2015 17:55, \"Paulo Pires\" notifications@github.com wrote:\nHmmm, current Android Studio complains about not having Gradle indeed. I\nwonder if they removed the bundled version... anyway one of the\nprerequisites in the doc is Gradle 2.2.1. Will mark this as an\nimprovement rather than a bug and will take care of it ASAP.

Just FYI, on the build.gradle file, we have \"proguard-rules.pro\", but the file is named \"proguard-android.txt\" on the local path. You have to rename it. The system-default file it's \"proguard-android.txt\" (called with getDefaultProguardFile)  and that's ok.\n. Yes, it works fine for me. And yes, the Proguard system changed a little on Studio. Thanks.\n. @nomwerp ProGuard problem again maybe?\n. @nomwerp wow!! Nice feature. The only thing I see, is the overlapping of text in some of the rows. Maybe increasing the height of elements will help?\n. @nomwerp you can active the \"view layout bounds\" on your device's Developer Tools, for debugging how the rows are rendering exactly.\n. @Pho3niX90 I'm requesting the change to 4 spaces indentation a long time ago :P.\n.

ACRA support sending report by email too \nhttps://github.com/ACRA/acra/wiki/AdvancedUsage#sending-reports-by-email\nYou can put this preference in settings. But the main advantage that https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader/pull/138 have its that its not need to have Email account (or SMTP) on Android device or Emulator. This is debugging feature (its only for the programmers and @pires can I know what is not ready for you ?) if you not like to debug application with my solution feels free to close PR and write new ACRA project for example ;)\n. @pires you can think about debugging plugins for every kind of developer ;)\n.

You can merge it now (debugging works) and to open new issue with this.. actually SHARED_SECRET is for the security but not for the obd-reader application this is for the security of the php mailer. But this can be done later.

Can I send logcat without crash? ...\n. @Pho3niX90 I`m open source programmer. If its have open source library for debugging (like ACRA) I will use it. If its have somethings wrong with this library I will make a PR but to start writing code from the  beginning.. this is not my style :)\n. @Pho3niX90 think about this and maybe you will understand ;)\n. :+1: \n. @pires @Pho3niX90 do its have command implemented in obd-reader that can return vehicle KM traveled? Its will be good to match it with the GPS distance.\n. @Pho3niX90 I have KM on the display of my car :) and I suppose that its have some pid to get this KM. If its have this KM (of production without reset) a car travels from point A to point B = km B - km A\n. @Pho3niX90 this is good idea. @kaorijp can you check distance calculated from speed like: List speedChanges = [30,10,30,25,5];\nif(curr_speed != previous_speed) //add to array\nint avgSpeed = 100/5=20 km/h\ndistance (km)= 20 x time(h)\n. Its wrong :) its need to have timestamp attached to the HashMap speed => timestamp\n. Maybe some mix if pid 31 and 21 supported by vehicle use it. If not it will be good to have distance based on speed changes or to enable both methods +GPS and match the results. Who can provide PR ? :)\n. SHARED_SECRET must be the same like in acra.php I think that its better after user save his email (encrypted in Android shared preferences) it will receive email message with SHARED_SECRET.\nMy idea was to use only one acra.php script hosted on openshift and user email can be configurable. OBD-Reader application will have email=null if(email != null && SHARED_SECRET!=null) ACRA logging will be enabled.\n. ",

Hello @bitaromulus \nThank for your report \ud83d\udc4d \nI have a question for you.\n\nI've tried with all of the available protocols and only the CAN ones provide good data (except for the Vehicule Speed).  \n\nWhat kind of CAN protocol that has been confirmed ?\nThere are many CAN protocols type that is defined in source code .\nEx: \nIOS_15765_4_CAN\nIOS_15765_4_CAN_B\nIOS_15765_4_CAN_C\nIOS_15765_4_CAN_D\nSAE_J1939_CAN\nUSER1_CAN\n. @bitaromulus\nI'm planing to buy a OBD 2 Simulator such as ECUsim.\nSo I have been testing on real car ( Toyota Voxy 2014).\nI didn't test with each of protocol type. Just set as AUTO.\nBeside that, I do not use Wifi , my expected is what is the real result that retuning by OBD II command only .\nI dont want to get distance by GPS. \nCan you help me to test Distance MIL with out GPS ?\n. Good evening!\n@Pho3niX90\nThanks for your explain.\nSo , OBD 2 is not currently supporting distance traveled command (PID) ?\n. @bitaromulus \n@Pho3niX90 \nI'm so sorry for ask you again about Distance traveled.\nI'm really confused with three Module $ PID\n- 01 21   -> Distance traveled with malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) on\n- 01 31   -> Distance traveled since codes cleared\n- 04 NA  -> Clear trouble codes / Malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) / Check engine light\n  (Clears all stored trouble codes and turns the MIL off.)\nFrom my understanding,we can get value that return from command Distance travelled with MIL on\nAnd then, if (04 NA) command has been called , it means the MIL if OFF.  At this time, we can use command (01 31) to get value in this case ( Since codes cleared) . What does value of (01 31) mean ?\nSo my confusion is :\n- What is the difference beween distance travelled , distance travelled with MIL on and distance travelled with MIL off ( in case of since codes cleared)\n. @Pho3niX90 \nEx: A car travels from point A to point B. \nHow many km driven in this case?\n. @Pho3niX90 \n\n31 has a max value it will display and does not get reset on each trip\n\nWhat does max value mean in this case ?\n@sytolk\n@Pho3niX90 \n\nMy only suggestion to what you want to achieve is monitor the cars speed over the session time and calculate the distance\n\nYep. This is my workaround until now.\nI also tested this case and has a litle difference from the real kilometer on car.\nResults\nIn fact, I have driven 2.2km and spent 15 minutes. But the calculation is returned 1.9 ~ 2.05 km \nMaybe the calculation the not good BUT the main problem is the speed is not updated in real time !\n( Around 2 seconds is delayed with real kilometer )\n.

    "bitaromulus": "Hello,\nI am also receiving some strange values for most of the parameters. I am using the ECUsim 2000 simulator and for example, the Speed and RPM is displayed like this:\nSpeed: 410D941:DAF11803410D942:DAF12803410D94\nRPM: 410CFFFF1:F11804410CFFFF\nWhen i manually change the value of the parameters of the ECUsim, these parameters are updated but are displayed in the same format.\nIs this a format issue, incompatibility or am i doing something wrong ?\nThank you !\nL.E. By the way, i am using an Asus ZEN Tablet with Android 5.0.1\n.  @Pho3niX90 \nHello again,\nMy ECUsim 2000 has 5 knobs which can be used to manually update the values of the parameters.\nThe parameters that can be monitored are:\n- Knob 1: Engine Coolant Temperature;\n- Knob 2: Engine Speed (RPM);\n- Knob 3: Vehicle Speed;\n- Knob 4: Oxygen Sensor Voltage (I don't know if this is actually available in the current API, didn't check);\n- Knob 5: Mass Air Flow (MAF).\nThis simulator, also has a Configuration DIP Switch (has two switches that set the protocol attributes for ISO 15765-4(CAN). Switch number 1 is also used to select the init type for ISO 14230-4: \na) 29 bit / 11 bit - Selects CAN frame ID type;\nb) 500 kbps / 250 kbps - Selects CAN baud rate;\nc) Fast Init / 5 Baud Init - Selects the type of initialization for ISO 14230-4).\nWhen i wrote the previous message, i was using the simulator with the following settings: \n29 bit / Fast Init + 500kbps\nWith these settings, i was receiving those strange values for most of the parameters, to be more precise: Knob 1, Knob 2 and Knob 3.\nMeanwhile, i changed to the following settings:\n11 bit / 5 Baud Init + either 500 kbps or 250 kbps\nAfter i did this, i ran the Android application once again and i've noticed that the values for Knob 1(Engine Coolant Temperature) and Knob 2(Engine Speed (RPM)) are displayed correctly. Knob 3(Vehicle Speed) is still the same strange format, though.\nCurrently, for Knob 3(Vehicle Speed) the displayed value is as follows:\n- With Knob 3 set at max, the displayed value is: 410DFF2:0DFF4000103700\n- With Knob 3 set at min, the displayed value is: 410D002:0D003000103700\nKnob 3 should give as a returned value 0x00 for min and 0xFF for max (0~255km/h).\nWhat is suprisingly is that certain bits of the displayed parameter, are constantly updated without touching any of the knobs:\n410DFF2:0DFF4000103700\nThe numbers marked in bold are being updated constantly (it doesn't has an exact period of time, it just changes at about 5~10 seconds).\nIf you need any other information, please let me  know and i will try to help in whatever way is possible for me.\nThank you in advance !\nL.E. I've tried using the same ECUsim and ELM 327 with the existing Torque application. Everything runs as it should, no problem regarding the display of parameters.\n. Good morning,\n@kaorijp I've tried with all of the available protocols and only the CAN ones provide good data (except for the Vehicule Speed). The other ones do not work, NODATA is displayed in most of the cases.\nCurrently, i also use AUTO setting.\nThis evening, i will also try to post a screenshot and if possible, a log file. I guess this way, it will be better.\nThank you and have a nice day !\n. Hello once again,\nI've tested once again the application but it's the same problem with the vehicle speed.\nI am attaching the log file, i hope it helps to identify more easily the source of this problem:\nOBDReader_logcat_1466540907052.txt\nIf you need any other information, please let me know.\nThank you and have a nice day !\n. Hello @kaorijp \nYou are right, i should have been more specific regarding the protocol which i use.\nMy ECUsim 2000 is not full featured, this means that it currently supports only the Standard ISO 15765-4.\nI currently have chosen the AUTO option from the configuration menu, but it always uses IOS_15765_4_CAN_C (except for the Vehicle Speed, everything works for me with this protocol).\nIf i choose a different protocol, NODATA is received/displayed.\nI hope this information is useful for you.\nHave a nice evening !\n. Hello @Pho3niX90 \nI have managed to group some raw incoming/outgoing data for each of the Knobs.\nIn the pictures, you will see incoming/outgoing (Rx/Tx) data from the ECUsim 2000, which i've captured using TeraTerm. I've started with min value for each knob and gradually increased it until the max value is reached (you will notice that the values will modify).\nAlso, for each Knob, i've associated the log file.\n11 bit / 5 Baud Init + 250 kbps\n\nKnob 1 (Engine Coolant Temperature)\n\nECUsim LOG: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20044707/16316364/f795ab94-398e-11e6-98f1-9bf4eb8843a8.jpg\nAndroid App LOG: -  (I forgot to send the logfile.
