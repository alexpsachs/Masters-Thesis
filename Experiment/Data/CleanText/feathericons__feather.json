    "colebemis": "Thanks for the suggestion! Look out for those icons in the next version.\n. circle, square, home, phone, edit and social icons have all been added \ud83d\udc4d . Is there something specific you're looking for in a 48px variation that you can't get by scaling the 24px version by 2x?\nPersonally, l think the set scales pretty well. (See screenshot)\n\n. Agreed. I think eventually it would be a great idea to make a custom 48x48 set. Right now, I'm trying to get everything set up to launch v2.0.0 and want to focus on building up a strong core set of 24x24 icons.. \ud83e\udd16 . The reason I made the search and zoom circles different is because the dimensions of the zoom circle need to be even in order to center the + and -. I thought that 16x16 circle looked a little too large for search because there there's nothing inside the circle. 15x15 seemed to work pretty well for search.\nCan you think of any scenarios where the different sizes might cause problems?. I really appreciate the suggestion but I think I'm going to leave them as-is for now. I'll continue to think about it though.. Feather already has a star icon :) https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/star.svg\nAlso, dragging and dropping any image into the text box should upload the image.. Ha ha ha. You're not annoying me at all! I appreciated all the feedback. I want Feather to be a community project.\nPlease keep annoying me \ud83d\ude04 . Added \u2705 https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/calendar.svg. > As the icon count increases it would be a good idea to add categories (file,devices,social,bla bla...) and/or search at the showcase page (https://feather.netlify.com/)\nAbsolutely. Adding search to the project page is next on my agenda. I'd love to split the set into categories but I'm struggling to come up with good category names. Do you have any ideas?\n\nYou could add a boilerplate (AI,EPS,whatever) with guides so we can contribute by sending you a new icon which you can fine-tune and include in the set or just dismiss it. This could also be done via wiki if you provide some ground rules (artboard=24x24pt / stroke = 2pt / artboard padding / etc)\n\nGreat idea. After I launch v2.0.0, I'm planning to write up some Design Guidelines including some simple rules, a boilerplate template, and instructions for contributing. I'd love to start taking contributions from the community!\n\nFor whoever prefers using iconfont will you be updating the icon set at https://icomoon.io/app/ ?\n\nI'm not sure who can update the icomoon set but it looks like it's been updated recently. The Feather set on icomoon now contains 163 icons (up from 130). https://icomoon.io/app/#/select/library\nThanks for the great suggestions!\n. Thanks for the icon! Maybe I'll add user-check and user-x icons to keep things consistent.\nI'll have to think about the icon font. I tend to discourage the use of icon fonts in general because I think SVGs are a much better alternative. Also, tools like Icomoon make it super easy to generate your own icon font from a set of SVGs. I would argue that using Icomoon is actually better because you can create a set with only the icons you need.. Here are some good articles comparing SVG to icon fonts:\n  - Inline SVG vs Icon Fonts [CAGEMATCH]\n  - Seriously, Don\u2019t Use Icon Fonts\n  - Ten reasons we switched from icon font to SVG. Feel free to customize Feather however you'd like! \nI didn't know Icomoon had that restriction. The built-in Feather icon library seems to work fine though. Someone must have converted strokes to outlines.. Thanks so much for doing that research! That's more than enough to get me started \ud83d\udc4d . @NetOperatorWibby Thank you for the kind words! \ud83d\ude03 . @Swizz That's an interesting idea. One issue with this approach is that when content is used to display an SVG, we are no longer able to control attributes of that SVG. For example, we'd have no control over the stroke color or stroke-width of the icons.. What are some use cases where this would be helpful? \nFYI, it looks like Bower is actually recommending people use yarn and webpack instead of Bower. (https://bower.io/). In v2.1.0, I started using SVGO to optimize the SVGs, so the new icons now have stroke and other attributes applied to the elements of the SVG instead of the SVG tag itself. This new approach speeds up development time by quite a bit. I plan to make the older icons follow this same pattern for consistency.\nCan you think of any reasons why applying attributes to the SVG tag (the old way) might be better than the contents of the SVG (the new way)? \nAlso, thanks for catching the #0f0f0f! I'll fix that right now.. The stroke color of box, link-2 and package have been fixed on the v2.2.0 branch. Thanks for pointing that out!. Thanks so much for creating all these icon requests @alexantr! Really helps me prioritize the work. Keep it up \ud83d\ude03 . I've been wanting to add the GitHub logo for a while but can't seem to fit it into Feather's style constraints. I'll keep working on it though. Thanks for the suggestion!. Added to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/logos/github.svg) :octocat: . Added to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/photo-and-video/film.svg) \ud83d\udc4d . Just to clarify, the only difference from file would be the horizontal lines?. I wish the Firefox icon was as simple as Chrome! \ud83d\ude04 . I'd be open to this if we can find a clean way to automatically build the font files from the icons directory \ud83d\udc4d . @oakfang Do you know how svgicons2svgfont handles SVG stroke?. Let's move this conversation to #101 \ud83d\udc4d . Added to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/logos/github.svg) :octocat: . Thanks for submitting a pull request! There are few things about this icon that don't quite fit with the Feather design guidelines. I'm working on writing up formal design guidelines so the requirements are more transparent.\nI'm going to close this pull as I just added a github icon to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/logos/github.svg). Thanks again for your contribution!. Thanks for the suggestion! I just changed the name to feather-icons and published it (https://www.npmjs.com/package/feather-icons). \nI plan to make the npm package more useful in the future but for now npm install feather-icons should work just fine. . This one is definitely tricky. I'll have to give it more thought. I'm liking the direction of that icon though @alexantr.. Thanks! Didn't know about .gitattributes. I'll look into this.. I think eventually it might make sense to create a react-feather repo for this purpose. Maybe vue-feather, jekyll-feather, etc. repos as well. Just an idea.. @timolins I 100% agree. Let's definitely explore that idea!!\n@Swizz I think it makes sense to separate the website from the main Feather repo. If we do something like @timolins is suggesting, the website could just have 'feather' as a dependency.\nI like the idea of making Feather a GitHub Org.. I know GitHub's Octicons do something similar to what @timolins is suggesting. We might be able to get some ideas from them. \nI really like the idea of keeping the main 'feather' repo as bare bones as possible: just a folder of SVGs and some JS to expose icon information. . We can create additional repos that leverage the main npm package to cover differ use cases.. Here's a nice article from GitHub about how they're using SVGs: https://github.com/blog/2112-delivering-octicons-with-svg. This is almost exactly what I want to do with the main feather repo: https://github.com/jxnblk/geomicons-open. Let's move this conversation to #101 \ud83d\udc4d . See conversation on #45 . I've thought about that too. Are you suggesting removing the concept of categories and displaying all icons as a single group on the website? Would categories then become general tags? For example, the cloud and sun icons might both have a weather tag?. What do you mean by \"show list of all tags in a switcher\"? Do you have examples of other websites that do something similar?. @zslabs Wow! Thanks for sharing. That looks really promising. \nI've thought about tags a lot. I think it's a great idea! The only downside is that it would require us to maintain a JSON file with information about every icon. But as feather grows, a giant JSON file might be unavoidable. I wish there was a way to add a tagging system and keep the icons directory as the single source of truth. . Thanks for doing this @kurisubrooks! I'm going to wait until I finish the contribution instructions before I merge anything. . @kurisubrooks How did you find that link to the Netlify deploy preview?. Oh, wow. That's cool!. That's a good idea. I'll look into how I can integrate something like that into the build process.. @roybarber Thanks! I'll reach out to you when I'm ready to start working on that \ud83d\udc4d . @Swizz Thanks! I've also been doing some research on SVG sprites. Pretty cool stuff \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah, I'm thinking Gulp, I find it much easier to read than Grunt.. Here are some related articles I've found:\n- https://cloudfour.com/thinks/our-svg-icon-process/\n- https://egghead.io/courses/create-an-svg-icon-system\n- https://nucleoapp.com/how-to-create-an-icon-system-using-svg-symbols/\n- https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/\n- http://varun.ca/icon-component/\n. @Swizz Yeah, I'd love to see what you've come up with. I can't guarantee that I'll merge it into the project right away. I want to spend some time with this and put a lot of thought into it. This article looks pretty promising: https://cloudfour.com/thinks/our-svg-icon-process/. How could my current workflow use Gulp? Are you talking about turning the npm scripts into Gulp tasks?. @Swizz Also, is there a reason you're thinking svgStore over gulp-svg-sprite? gulp-svg-sprite seems like it's being actively maintained and svgStore hasn't been updated in a while.. @roybarber I'm designing in Illustrator. I tried Sketch but Illustrator handles icons way better. I'm all for automation! I'd love to just export from Illustrator and have the build take care of the rest.. I'm also interested in how to best deliver and use the SVG sprite with npm as that will probably be how most people will use it. Also, can SVG sprites be used with CDN? I'd love to give people access to Feather in web apps like CodePen or JSBin.. I'm wondering if use will work with a CDN.\nFor example, will something like this <use xlink:href=\"https://unpkg.com/../sprite.svg#mail\"/> work?. \ud83d\udc4d Just something to think about. Why not implement something like Entypo?. Haha just trying to consider all the options. There are a lot of pros and cons to consider for every approach.. What do you mean by \"loader\"?. Sounds good \ud83d\udc4d I feel like we should try to tackle each of these one by one. Seems like starting with SVG sprite makes the most sense.. This looks like a good resource as well: https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg. A LOT of good stuff in here too: https://css-tricks.com/mega-list-svg-information/. @mshwery We're discussing that over on #41.. Let's move this conversation to #101 \ud83d\udc4d . One of the guiding principles of Feather is that all icons use a 2px stroke with no fill. This creates consistency. Having a filled star would break this pattern and wouldn't fit in with the rest of the set. For that reason, I don't think it's a good idea to add it.\nThat being said, I realize that there are valid use cases for a filled star. The good news is that SVGs are very flexible and can be used in a variety of ways. It wouldn't be hard for anyone to add a fill to the star outline if they needed a solid star \u2b50\ufe0f . I think that would be a little cluttered and probably wouldn't convey the idea very clearly. I think a half star only makes sense when using fills.\n. Do you have any specific icons in mind? It'd be super helpful if you could create separate GitHub issues for the icons you need. That way it's easier to tell when an issue can be closed.. I think the octagon icon would work well for this use case (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/core/octagon.svg). When we implement a tagging system, we can add a stop tag to octagon.. Actually just added a github icon to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/logos/github.svg) :octocat: . Thanks for your suggestion! This was the logo I had planned to make originally. However, this version of the Facebook logo doesn't work well within the constraints of Feather. The outside box must be 20x20 which makes the \"f\" too small. Feather's Facebook logo is still easily recognizable and works within the constraints of the set.. This seems like spam. This issue is in direct violation of the Code of Conduct. I will not tolerate the use of any hateful language or symbols. This violation has been reported to GitHub.. This might be a hard one, but I'll try! \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for opening these pulls, @bdbch! I'm going to hold off merging anything into the project until I finish up the design guidelines and contribution instructions. Stay tuned \ud83d\ude42. They're coming. I've been pretty busy with finals and work so I haven't had time to work on them, but once summer break starts, I'll have more free time.. Sorry for stepping on your toes, but I added a save icon in a recent release (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/core/save.svg). Let me know if you have any more icon requests \ud83d\udc4d . @chrismessina Hmm, I just tried downloading the zip from feathericons.com and I found film.svg in icons/photo-and-video. Would you mind trying again to see if it's still missing?. Haha, no worries! Don't hesitate to create another issue if you find something wrong or have an icon request \ud83d\ude03  . I see your point. I'll go ahead and change that soon \ud83d\udc4d . Oh, right. I didn't think of that use case. I'll change the SVGO settings \ud83d\udc4d . Are you thinking this would go in the logos category?. Thanks for letting me know! I've updated the README. Please let me know if you find any more inconsistencies.. @vitorgalvao I haven't given it too much thought yet. For now, I'll keep the MIT license because it seems to be the Open Source standard. I'm definitely considering The Unlicense though. Thanks for sending that to me!. I'm diggin' Twitter's camera flip icon \ud83d\udc4c . I was actually thinking that the individual SVGs in the icons directory should be the single source of truth. Everything else can be generated from that directory. That way all we have to do to add an icon is put an SVG into the icons directory and everything else updates.\nIn terms of DOM injection, I'm doing some research on that right now. I'll post a write-up of my findings soon.. Here are my ideas on ways Feather could be used:\nOption 1: Copy & Paste\nIf you only need one or two icons, copying and pasting the SVG code directly into your markup might be the best solution. This is by far the simplest way to use Feather.\nOption 2: Node\nFor more advanced use cases, Feather could expose an icons object, making icon information easily accessible. Additionally, Feather could provide a toSVG method that accepts an icon name and an options object and returns a string of the <svg> tag. \nExample:\n```javascript\nconst feather = require('feather-icons');\nfeather.icons.mail\n/ {\n    name: 'mail',\n    contents: '',\n    options: {\n        class: 'feather feather-mail',\n        width: 24,\n        height: 24, \n        viewBox: '0 0 24 24',\n        fill: 'none',\n        stroke: 'currentColor',\n        'stroke-width': 2,\n        'stroke-linecap': 'round',\n        'stroke-linejoin': 'round',\n    },\n} /\nfeather.toSVG('mail', {})\n// ''\n```\nThis option would make Feather easier to use with front-end frameworks like React and Vue and would aid in the creation of packages like 'react-feather', 'vue-feather', etc.\nI imagine that this feather object would be the core of the Feather icon library. All other usage implementations could reference this object for icon information.\nOption 3: JavaScript Injection\nThe feather object could have an inject method that accepts a DOM NodeList and replaces those elements with the SVG icon that corresponds to the element's data-icon attribute.\nExample:\n```html\n\n\n\n    const icons = document.querySelectorAll('feather');\n    feather.inject(icons);\n\n```\nThis option would be good for prototyping in the browser because it could utilize a CDN.\nOption 4: Spritesheet\nFeather could generate an SVG sprite by looping over every key in feather.icons object. To use the sprite, you could either paste the contents of feather.svg immediately below the opening body tag and use it like this:\nhtml\n<svg><use xlink:href=\"#mail\"/></svg>\nor just reference feather.svg like this:\nhtml\n<svg><use xlink:href=\"/path/to/feather.svg#mail\"></svg>\nI know IE has some problems referencing external SVGs in this way so we would probably have to provide a polyfill of some kind.\nFinal Thoughts\nI'd like to keep the main feather repo as barebones as possible and keep it platform agnostic. We can create helper repos like react-feather for platform specific use cases. \nI'd love to get feedback on these ideas. Let me know if you have any ideas about how to best deliver Feather. I want to design the best possible experience for Feather users before getting in the weeds with implementation details.\n. @mage3k @carmelopullara I just merged a pull request adding a Related Projects to the README. I'd love for you guys to add your projects to the list. Just submit a pull request \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for letting me know! Could you show me some examples of alternative pie-chart icons that don't look like clocks?. Haha, I wouldn't call this \"blasphemy\" but using strokes over fills was intentional. Here's an article that details the benefits of SVG stroke: http://danklammer.com/articles/svg-stroke-ftw/. From that picture, it looks like you are setting the fill of the SVGs to something other than none.. I'm pretty sure use won't let you access the contents of the SVG with CSS. So svg [stroke] won't work. I'm working on an SVG system that will solve a lot of these issues.. This looks pretty similar to the current monitor icon. Maybe this will cover your use case? https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/core/monitor.svg. Using img won't let you change anything about the SVG. If it doesn't make things too messy, I would just copy the inline SVG directly into the code. This will allow you to change any attribute with CSS.  \nHere's a great video explaining the different ways SVGs can be used and the pros and cons of each approach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af4ZQJ14yu8\nHope this helps.. Thanks for doing that @sweetyams! I don't think I'll include a Sketch file because it requires too much maintenance. I'd prefer to keep the icons directory as the single source of truth for Feather.\nP.S. These icons were actually created in Illustrator.. @ExPixel Thanks so much for your contribution! Just wanted to let you know that I'm not ignoring this pull. I just want to hold off merging anything right now because I'm about to make some significant organizational changes to the repo. . Feather already has a mobile phone icon (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/core/smartphone.svg) \ud83d\udc4d . Oh, I copied over a lot of the old icons into the new set but I must have missed the paper clip icon. I'll add it back soon \ud83d\udc4d. If a webfont can be generated from the icons directory, I'm open to the idea. I think there might be problems converting SVGs that use stroke instead of fill. That's definitely something to look into though.. Thanks for making that! I think this is a great idea \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . Oops. Thanks for the heads up! I'll have to redirect colebemis.com/feather to feathericons.com. Do you happen to know how to set up a redirect with GitHub pages?. Fixed! colebemis.com/feather should redirect to feathericons.com now. . Thanks for letting me know! All the links should work now \ud83d\udc4d . Good idea! It's funny that you opened this issue on my birthday \ud83d\ude04 . @ckcallen I like that! Yeah, just post the link to the SVG in this issue. I'll give you credit on the README \ud83d\ude03 Thanks!. @thiagotomasi I have a very specific process for adding icons that I haven't documented yet. Because of this, at the moment I am not accepting pull requests containing icons but that doesn't mean you can't contribute. The best way to contribute an icon is to create an issue with a screenshot and link to an SVG of your icon. If I use your design, I'll document it and make sure you get credit \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks so much for taking the time to write this! I'll take a more detailed look at this when I get home.\nBtw, the deploy/netlify check will always fail right now so don't worry about that.. @weblancaster I made some minor changes. Can you look over my edits and just give me a \ud83d\udc4d if you think it's ready to merge? :tada:. I guess this just moved to the top of my list :)\n. Excellent work! I'd encourage you to think about how you can make it even simpler. Feather's 24x24 size constraint forces us to reduce concepts to their simplest form. How can a bike be represented in as few lines as possible?. Good catch! Thanks for fixing this \ud83d\udc4d . Can you show me the code that caused this error?. Try using this instead and see if that still gives you an error: \n```html\n\n// instead of \n\n``. Great! The problem is thathttps://unpkg.com/feather-iconsis a shortcut that points tofeather.jswhich has a relative path to its source map. However,https://unpkg.com/feather.js.mapdoesn't exist. By using the long URL (https://unpkg.com/feather-icons/dist/feather.min.js`) instead of the shortcut, the relative path to the source map is correct. Also, I gave you the link to the minified version which is probably why it's faster.\nI'll update the docs so no one else runs into this issue \ud83d\udc4d . Can you explain the purpose of this pull?. Awesome! \ud83c\udf89  Here are some of my ideas on those Roadmap items:\n\nAdd tests\n\nI'd like to use Ava for testing but I'm open to discussing other options if you have strong opinions. \nI think we should place the tests in the src directory like this:\nsrc/\n  index.js\n  to-svg.js\n  replace.js\n  __tests__/\n    index.test.js\n    to-svg.test.js\n    replace.test.js\n\nTrack code coverage\n\nHere's an example of how to track code coverage with Ava: https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/code-coverage.md\nI'd also like to integrate code coverage with GitHub using Codecov.\n\nUse Prettier to enforce consistent code style\n\nI think we should use prettier-eslint because it plays nicely with ESLint. I've been using for my other projects and it works really well. \nWhen do you think is the best time to automatically format the code? Should we add Prettier formatting as a precommit hook?\nOk, I think that's it. Let me know if you have any comments or questions. I'd be more than happy to help. Twitter is probably the easiest way to ask me questions. Also, please let me know how I can improve the contribution process/documention. Thanks!\nP.S. You can run npm run all in your terminal to get the project all set up. Also, npm run cm will help you format your commit messages properly.. @bebosudo Yeah, that's probably the problem. Alternatively, you could  run npm run all to generate the /dist directory and confirm that there are no linting errors. Both npm run build and npm run all should fix this problem.. When using Feather on the client-side, dist/feather.min.js or dist/feather.js is all you need to get it working. icons.json is used to build feather.min.js and feather.js but is not necessary for production. The icons directory is not needed when using Feather in the browser. v2+ was not designed to be used in the browser so there are no files to host.\nThanks for doing this! I'm excited to see this happen \ud83d\udc4d . Country flags would be very hard to do in the same style as the other Feather icons, especially because none of the icons have color. I'd say the globe icons (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/globe.svg) is your best bet \ud83d\udc4d  . Thanks for updating this!. Could you be more specific about which currency icons you'd like? USD? Euro? Screenshots would be super helpful \ud83d\ude0a . Thanks for adding this! . The code for the website is on the site branch: https://github.com/colebemis/feather/tree/site. You could open a pull request on that branch.\nIf you do decide to take this on, I'd appreciate if ran your design for this feature by me before you put too much effort in. Thanks! I think this could be a really helpful feature.. We already havehelp-circle \ud83d\ude04 https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/help-circle.svg. Awesome \ud83c\udf89 Nice work!. Thanks!. This looks great! \ud83c\udf89 I want to take some time to go over this because I think this is an important feature. Hold tight.. I've been pretty swamped with school and work. Do you want to open a PR? \nWe currently have a node script called bin/build-svgs.js that processes all the SVGs from the icons direction and puts them in the dist/icons directory. To create an SVG sprite, all we should have to do is write a similar bin/build-sprite.js script that processes all the SVGs from the icons directory and combines them into a dist/feather-sprite.svg. You'd also have to do some research on current best practices for SVG sprites (because they change so frequently).. See https://github.com/colebemis/feather/issues/48#issuecomment-305956722. Thanks for the suggestion! However, I'm going to close this issue for the reasons stated in https://github.com/colebemis/feather/issues/48#issuecomment-305956722. This is awesome! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Nice work. Feel free to share \ud83d\udc4d . @1602 Feel free to open a pull request to add your project to the Related Projects section of the README: https://github.com/colebemis/feather#related-projects. Thanks for sharing!. \ud83d\ude04  Don't worry, I'll have more time over Thanksgiving and Winter break. I've got some exciting plans for Feather.. Thanks! \ud83c\udf89 . Would the aperture icon fit your needs?\n https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/aperture.svg. Thanks again for the suggestion!

Added \u2705 https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/calendar.svg. > As the icon count increases it would be a good idea to add categories (file,devices,social,bla bla...) and/or search at the showcase page (https://feather.netlify.com/)\nAbsolutely. Adding search to the project page is next on my agenda. I'd love to split the set into categories but I'm struggling to come up with good category names. Do you have any ideas?\n\nYou could add a boilerplate (AI,EPS,whatever) with guides so we can contribute by sending you a new icon which you can fine-tune and include in the set or just dismiss it. This could also be done via wiki if you provide some ground rules (artboard=24x24pt / stroke = 2pt / artboard padding / etc)\n\nGreat idea. After I launch v2.0.0, I'm planning to write up some Design Guidelines including some simple rules, a boilerplate template, and instructions for contributing. I'd love to start taking contributions from the community!\n\nFor whoever prefers using iconfont will you be updating the icon set at https://icomoon.io/app/ ?\n\nI'm not sure who can update the icomoon set but it looks like it's been updated recently. The Feather set on icomoon now contains 163 icons (up from 130). https://icomoon.io/app/#/select/library\nThanks for the great suggestions!\n. Thanks for the icon! Maybe I'll add user-check and user-x icons to keep things consistent.\nI'll have to think about the icon font. I tend to discourage the use of icon fonts in general because I think SVGs are a much better alternative. Also, tools like Icomoon make it super easy to generate your own icon font from a set of SVGs. I would argue that using Icomoon is actually better because you can create a set with only the icons you need.. Here are some good articles comparing SVG to icon fonts:\n  - Inline SVG vs Icon Fonts [CAGEMATCH]\n  - Seriously, Don\u2019t Use Icon Fonts\n  - Ten reasons we switched from icon font to SVG. Feel free to customize Feather however you'd like! \nI didn't know Icomoon had that restriction. The built-in Feather icon library seems to work fine though. Someone must have converted strokes to outlines.. Thanks so much for doing that research! That's more than enough to get me started \ud83d\udc4d . @NetOperatorWibby Thank you for the kind words! \ud83d\ude03 . @Swizz That's an interesting idea. One issue with this approach is that when content is used to display an SVG, we are no longer able to control attributes of that SVG. For example, we'd have no control over the stroke color or stroke-width of the icons.. What are some use cases where this would be helpful? \nFYI, it looks like Bower is actually recommending people use yarn and webpack instead of Bower. (https://bower.io/). In v2.1.0, I started using SVGO to optimize the SVGs, so the new icons now have stroke and other attributes applied to the elements of the SVG instead of the SVG tag itself. This new approach speeds up development time by quite a bit. I plan to make the older icons follow this same pattern for consistency.\nCan you think of any reasons why applying attributes to the SVG tag (the old way) might be better than the contents of the SVG (the new way)? \nAlso, thanks for catching the #0f0f0f! I'll fix that right now.. The stroke color of box, link-2 and package have been fixed on the v2.2.0 branch. Thanks for pointing that out!. Thanks so much for creating all these icon requests @alexantr! Really helps me prioritize the work. Keep it up \ud83d\ude03 . I've been wanting to add the GitHub logo for a while but can't seem to fit it into Feather's style constraints. I'll keep working on it though. Thanks for the suggestion!. Added to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/logos/github.svg) :octocat: . Added to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/photo-and-video/film.svg) \ud83d\udc4d . Just to clarify, the only difference from file would be the horizontal lines?. I wish the Firefox icon was as simple as Chrome! \ud83d\ude04 . I'd be open to this if we can find a clean way to automatically build the font files from the icons directory \ud83d\udc4d . @oakfang Do you know how svgicons2svgfont handles SVG stroke?. Let's move this conversation to #101 \ud83d\udc4d . Added to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/logos/github.svg) :octocat: . Thanks for submitting a pull request! There are few things about this icon that don't quite fit with the Feather design guidelines. I'm working on writing up formal design guidelines so the requirements are more transparent.\nI'm going to close this pull as I just added a github icon to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/logos/github.svg). Thanks again for your contribution!. Thanks for the suggestion! I just changed the name to feather-icons and published it (https://www.npmjs.com/package/feather-icons). \nI plan to make the npm package more useful in the future but for now npm install feather-icons should work just fine. . This one is definitely tricky. I'll have to give it more thought. I'm liking the direction of that icon though @alexantr.. Thanks! Didn't know about .gitattributes. I'll look into this.. I think eventually it might make sense to create a react-feather repo for this purpose. Maybe vue-feather, jekyll-feather, etc. repos as well. Just an idea.. @timolins I 100% agree. Let's definitely explore that idea!!\n@Swizz I think it makes sense to separate the website from the main Feather repo. If we do something like @timolins is suggesting, the website could just have 'feather' as a dependency.\nI like the idea of making Feather a GitHub Org.. I know GitHub's Octicons do something similar to what @timolins is suggesting. We might be able to get some ideas from them. \nI really like the idea of keeping the main 'feather' repo as bare bones as possible: just a folder of SVGs and some JS to expose icon information. . We can create additional repos that leverage the main npm package to cover differ use cases.. Here's a nice article from GitHub about how they're using SVGs: https://github.com/blog/2112-delivering-octicons-with-svg. This is almost exactly what I want to do with the main feather repo: https://github.com/jxnblk/geomicons-open. Let's move this conversation to #101 \ud83d\udc4d . See conversation on #45 . I've thought about that too. Are you suggesting removing the concept of categories and displaying all icons as a single group on the website? Would categories then become general tags? For example, the cloud and sun icons might both have a weather tag?. What do you mean by \"show list of all tags in a switcher\"? Do you have examples of other websites that do something similar?. @zslabs Wow! Thanks for sharing. That looks really promising. \nI've thought about tags a lot. I think it's a great idea! The only downside is that it would require us to maintain a JSON file with information about every icon. But as feather grows, a giant JSON file might be unavoidable. I wish there was a way to add a tagging system and keep the icons directory as the single source of truth. . Thanks for doing this @kurisubrooks! I'm going to wait until I finish the contribution instructions before I merge anything. . @kurisubrooks How did you find that link to the Netlify deploy preview?. Oh, wow. That's cool!. That's a good idea. I'll look into how I can integrate something like that into the build process.. @roybarber Thanks! I'll reach out to you when I'm ready to start working on that \ud83d\udc4d . @Swizz Thanks! I've also been doing some research on SVG sprites. Pretty cool stuff \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah, I'm thinking Gulp, I find it much easier to read than Grunt.. Here are some related articles I've found:\n- https://cloudfour.com/thinks/our-svg-icon-process/\n- https://egghead.io/courses/create-an-svg-icon-system\n- https://nucleoapp.com/how-to-create-an-icon-system-using-svg-symbols/\n- https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/\n- http://varun.ca/icon-component/\n. @Swizz Yeah, I'd love to see what you've come up with. I can't guarantee that I'll merge it into the project right away. I want to spend some time with this and put a lot of thought into it. This article looks pretty promising: https://cloudfour.com/thinks/our-svg-icon-process/. How could my current workflow use Gulp? Are you talking about turning the npm scripts into Gulp tasks?. @Swizz Also, is there a reason you're thinking svgStore over gulp-svg-sprite? gulp-svg-sprite seems like it's being actively maintained and svgStore hasn't been updated in a while.. @roybarber I'm designing in Illustrator. I tried Sketch but Illustrator handles icons way better. I'm all for automation! I'd love to just export from Illustrator and have the build take care of the rest.. I'm also interested in how to best deliver and use the SVG sprite with npm as that will probably be how most people will use it. Also, can SVG sprites be used with CDN? I'd love to give people access to Feather in web apps like CodePen or JSBin.. I'm wondering if use will work with a CDN.\nFor example, will something like this <use xlink:href=\"https://unpkg.com/../sprite.svg#mail\"/> work?. \ud83d\udc4d Just something to think about. Why not implement something like Entypo?. Haha just trying to consider all the options. There are a lot of pros and cons to consider for every approach.. What do you mean by \"loader\"?. Sounds good \ud83d\udc4d I feel like we should try to tackle each of these one by one. Seems like starting with SVG sprite makes the most sense.. This looks like a good resource as well: https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg. A LOT of good stuff in here too: https://css-tricks.com/mega-list-svg-information/. @mshwery We're discussing that over on #41.. Let's move this conversation to #101 \ud83d\udc4d . One of the guiding principles of Feather is that all icons use a 2px stroke with no fill. This creates consistency. Having a filled star would break this pattern and wouldn't fit in with the rest of the set. For that reason, I don't think it's a good idea to add it.\nThat being said, I realize that there are valid use cases for a filled star. The good news is that SVGs are very flexible and can be used in a variety of ways. It wouldn't be hard for anyone to add a fill to the star outline if they needed a solid star \u2b50\ufe0f . I think that would be a little cluttered and probably wouldn't convey the idea very clearly. I think a half star only makes sense when using fills.\n. Do you have any specific icons in mind? It'd be super helpful if you could create separate GitHub issues for the icons you need. That way it's easier to tell when an issue can be closed.. I think the octagon icon would work well for this use case (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/core/octagon.svg). When we implement a tagging system, we can add a stop tag to octagon.. Actually just added a github icon to the v2.2.0 branch (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/v2.2.0/icons/logos/github.svg) :octocat: . Thanks for your suggestion! This was the logo I had planned to make originally. However, this version of the Facebook logo doesn't work well within the constraints of Feather. The outside box must be 20x20 which makes the \"f\" too small. Feather's Facebook logo is still easily recognizable and works within the constraints of the set.. This seems like spam. This issue is in direct violation of the Code of Conduct. I will not tolerate the use of any hateful language or symbols. This violation has been reported to GitHub.. This might be a hard one, but I'll try! \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for opening these pulls, @bdbch! I'm going to hold off merging anything into the project until I finish up the design guidelines and contribution instructions. Stay tuned \ud83d\ude42. They're coming. I've been pretty busy with finals and work so I haven't had time to work on them, but once summer break starts, I'll have more free time.. Sorry for stepping on your toes, but I added a save icon in a recent release (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/core/save.svg). Let me know if you have any more icon requests \ud83d\udc4d . @chrismessina Hmm, I just tried downloading the zip from feathericons.com and I found film.svg in icons/photo-and-video. Would you mind trying again to see if it's still missing?. Haha, no worries! Don't hesitate to create another issue if you find something wrong or have an icon request \ud83d\ude03  . I see your point. I'll go ahead and change that soon \ud83d\udc4d . Oh, right. I didn't think of that use case. I'll change the SVGO settings \ud83d\udc4d . Are you thinking this would go in the logos category?. Thanks for letting me know! I've updated the README. Please let me know if you find any more inconsistencies.. @vitorgalvao I haven't given it too much thought yet. For now, I'll keep the MIT license because it seems to be the Open Source standard. I'm definitely considering The Unlicense though. Thanks for sending that to me!. I'm diggin' Twitter's camera flip icon \ud83d\udc4c . I was actually thinking that the individual SVGs in the icons directory should be the single source of truth. Everything else can be generated from that directory. That way all we have to do to add an icon is put an SVG into the icons directory and everything else updates.\nIn terms of DOM injection, I'm doing some research on that right now. I'll post a write-up of my findings soon.. Here are my ideas on ways Feather could be used:\nOption 1: Copy & Paste\nIf you only need one or two icons, copying and pasting the SVG code directly into your markup might be the best solution. This is by far the simplest way to use Feather.\nOption 2: Node\nFor more advanced use cases, Feather could expose an icons object, making icon information easily accessible. Additionally, Feather could provide a toSVG method that accepts an icon name and an options object and returns a string of the <svg> tag. \nExample:\n```javascript\nconst feather = require('feather-icons');\nfeather.icons.mail\n/ {\n    name: 'mail',\n    contents: '',\n    options: {\n        class: 'feather feather-mail',\n        width: 24,\n        height: 24, \n        viewBox: '0 0 24 24',\n        fill: 'none',\n        stroke: 'currentColor',\n        'stroke-width': 2,\n        'stroke-linecap': 'round',\n        'stroke-linejoin': 'round',\n    },\n} /\nfeather.toSVG('mail', {})\n// ''\n```\nThis option would make Feather easier to use with front-end frameworks like React and Vue and would aid in the creation of packages like 'react-feather', 'vue-feather', etc.\nI imagine that this feather object would be the core of the Feather icon library. All other usage implementations could reference this object for icon information.\nOption 3: JavaScript Injection\nThe feather object could have an inject method that accepts a DOM NodeList and replaces those elements with the SVG icon that corresponds to the element's data-icon attribute.\nExample:\n```html\n\n\n\n    const icons = document.querySelectorAll('feather');\n    feather.inject(icons);\n\n```\nThis option would be good for prototyping in the browser because it could utilize a CDN.\nOption 4: Spritesheet\nFeather could generate an SVG sprite by looping over every key in feather.icons object. To use the sprite, you could either paste the contents of feather.svg immediately below the opening body tag and use it like this:\nhtml\n<svg><use xlink:href=\"#mail\"/></svg>\nor just reference feather.svg like this:\nhtml\n<svg><use xlink:href=\"/path/to/feather.svg#mail\"></svg>\nI know IE has some problems referencing external SVGs in this way so we would probably have to provide a polyfill of some kind.\nFinal Thoughts\nI'd like to keep the main feather repo as barebones as possible and keep it platform agnostic. We can create helper repos like react-feather for platform specific use cases. \nI'd love to get feedback on these ideas. Let me know if you have any ideas about how to best deliver Feather. I want to design the best possible experience for Feather users before getting in the weeds with implementation details.\n. @mage3k @carmelopullara I just merged a pull request adding a Related Projects to the README. I'd love for you guys to add your projects to the list. Just submit a pull request \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for letting me know! Could you show me some examples of alternative pie-chart icons that don't look like clocks?. Haha, I wouldn't call this \"blasphemy\" but using strokes over fills was intentional. Here's an article that details the benefits of SVG stroke: http://danklammer.com/articles/svg-stroke-ftw/. From that picture, it looks like you are setting the fill of the SVGs to something other than none.. I'm pretty sure use won't let you access the contents of the SVG with CSS. So svg [stroke] won't work. I'm working on an SVG system that will solve a lot of these issues.. This looks pretty similar to the current monitor icon. Maybe this will cover your use case? https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/core/monitor.svg. Using img won't let you change anything about the SVG. If it doesn't make things too messy, I would just copy the inline SVG directly into the code. This will allow you to change any attribute with CSS.  \nHere's a great video explaining the different ways SVGs can be used and the pros and cons of each approach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af4ZQJ14yu8\nHope this helps.. Thanks for doing that @sweetyams! I don't think I'll include a Sketch file because it requires too much maintenance. I'd prefer to keep the icons directory as the single source of truth for Feather.\nP.S. These icons were actually created in Illustrator.. @ExPixel Thanks so much for your contribution! Just wanted to let you know that I'm not ignoring this pull. I just want to hold off merging anything right now because I'm about to make some significant organizational changes to the repo. . Feather already has a mobile phone icon (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/core/smartphone.svg) \ud83d\udc4d . Oh, I copied over a lot of the old icons into the new set but I must have missed the paper clip icon. I'll add it back soon \ud83d\udc4d. If a webfont can be generated from the icons directory, I'm open to the idea. I think there might be problems converting SVGs that use stroke instead of fill. That's definitely something to look into though.. Thanks for making that! I think this is a great idea \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . Oops. Thanks for the heads up! I'll have to redirect colebemis.com/feather to feathericons.com. Do you happen to know how to set up a redirect with GitHub pages?. Fixed! colebemis.com/feather should redirect to feathericons.com now. . Thanks for letting me know! All the links should work now \ud83d\udc4d . Good idea! It's funny that you opened this issue on my birthday \ud83d\ude04 . @ckcallen I like that! Yeah, just post the link to the SVG in this issue. I'll give you credit on the README \ud83d\ude03 Thanks!. @thiagotomasi I have a very specific process for adding icons that I haven't documented yet. Because of this, at the moment I am not accepting pull requests containing icons but that doesn't mean you can't contribute. The best way to contribute an icon is to create an issue with a screenshot and link to an SVG of your icon. If I use your design, I'll document it and make sure you get credit \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks so much for taking the time to write this! I'll take a more detailed look at this when I get home.\nBtw, the deploy/netlify check will always fail right now so don't worry about that.. @weblancaster I made some minor changes. Can you look over my edits and just give me a \ud83d\udc4d if you think it's ready to merge? :tada:. I guess this just moved to the top of my list :)\n. Excellent work! I'd encourage you to think about how you can make it even simpler. Feather's 24x24 size constraint forces us to reduce concepts to their simplest form. How can a bike be represented in as few lines as possible?. Good catch! Thanks for fixing this \ud83d\udc4d . Can you show me the code that caused this error?. Try using this instead and see if that still gives you an error: \n```html\n\n// instead of \n\n``. Great! The problem is thathttps://unpkg.com/feather-iconsis a shortcut that points tofeather.jswhich has a relative path to its source map. However,https://unpkg.com/feather.js.mapdoesn't exist. By using the long URL (https://unpkg.com/feather-icons/dist/feather.min.js`) instead of the shortcut, the relative path to the source map is correct. Also, I gave you the link to the minified version which is probably why it's faster.\nI'll update the docs so no one else runs into this issue \ud83d\udc4d . Can you explain the purpose of this pull?. Awesome! \ud83c\udf89  Here are some of my ideas on those Roadmap items:\n\nAdd tests\n\nI'd like to use Ava for testing but I'm open to discussing other options if you have strong opinions. \nI think we should place the tests in the src directory like this:\nsrc/\n  index.js\n  to-svg.js\n  replace.js\n  __tests__/\n    index.test.js\n    to-svg.test.js\n    replace.test.js\n\nTrack code coverage\n\nHere's an example of how to track code coverage with Ava: https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/code-coverage.md\nI'd also like to integrate code coverage with GitHub using Codecov.\n\nUse Prettier to enforce consistent code style\n\nI think we should use prettier-eslint because it plays nicely with ESLint. I've been using for my other projects and it works really well. \nWhen do you think is the best time to automatically format the code? Should we add Prettier formatting as a precommit hook?\nOk, I think that's it. Let me know if you have any comments or questions. I'd be more than happy to help. Twitter is probably the easiest way to ask me questions. Also, please let me know how I can improve the contribution process/documention. Thanks!\nP.S. You can run npm run all in your terminal to get the project all set up. Also, npm run cm will help you format your commit messages properly.. @bebosudo Yeah, that's probably the problem. Alternatively, you could  run npm run all to generate the /dist directory and confirm that there are no linting errors. Both npm run build and npm run all should fix this problem.. When using Feather on the client-side, dist/feather.min.js or dist/feather.js is all you need to get it working. icons.json is used to build feather.min.js and feather.js but is not necessary for production. The icons directory is not needed when using Feather in the browser. v2+ was not designed to be used in the browser so there are no files to host.\nThanks for doing this! I'm excited to see this happen \ud83d\udc4d . Country flags would be very hard to do in the same style as the other Feather icons, especially because none of the icons have color. I'd say the globe icons (https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/globe.svg) is your best bet \ud83d\udc4d  . Thanks for updating this!. Could you be more specific about which currency icons you'd like? USD? Euro? Screenshots would be super helpful \ud83d\ude0a . Thanks for adding this! . The code for the website is on the site branch: https://github.com/colebemis/feather/tree/site. You could open a pull request on that branch.\nIf you do decide to take this on, I'd appreciate if ran your design for this feature by me before you put too much effort in. Thanks! I think this could be a really helpful feature.. We already havehelp-circle \ud83d\ude04 https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/icons/help-circle.svg. Awesome \ud83c\udf89 Nice work!. Thanks!. This looks great! \ud83c\udf89 I want to take some time to go over this because I think this is an important feature. Hold tight.. I've been pretty swamped with school and work. Do you want to open a PR? \nWe currently have a node script called bin/build-svgs.js that processes all the SVGs from the icons direction and puts them in the dist/icons directory. To create an SVG sprite, all we should have to do is write a similar bin/build-sprite.js script that processes all the SVGs from the icons directory and combines them into a dist/feather-sprite.svg. You'd also have to do some research on current best practices for SVG sprites (because they change so frequently).. See https://github.com/colebemis/feather/issues/48#issuecomment-305956722. Thanks for the suggestion! However, I'm going to close this issue for the reasons stated in https://github.com/colebemis/feather/issues/48#issuecomment-305956722. This is awesome! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Nice work. Feel free to share \ud83d\udc4d . @1602 Feel free to open a pull request to add your project to the Related Projects section of the README: https://github.com/colebemis/feather#related-projects. Thanks for sharing!. \ud83d\ude04  Don't worry, I'll have more time over Thanksgiving and Winter break. I've got some exciting plans for Feather.. Thanks! \ud83c\udf89 .

I don't think there would be a specific, isolated scenario where it might cause problems, just that the inconsistency is a problem in itself.\nI actually prefer the 16px circle for search, I like the added weight on the glass of the magnifying glass-it adds legibility I think, especially at a smaller 16px size.\nNot a big deal but certainly an inconsistency imo..
