    "sehmaschine": "cool \u2013 thanks.\n. thanks again. please note that I\u00b4m just giving github a try and grappelli is still maintained via google-code.\n. autocompletes are now availabe with the autocomplete-branch:\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/autocomplete\nhttp://readthedocs.org/docs/django-grappelli/en/autocomplete/customization.html#autocomplete-lookups\ntested with firefox, chrome & safari on regular forms, inline-formsets (tabular and stacked) and generic inlines. NOTE THAT THE UI IS NOT FINISHED YET ...\nTODO:\n\u2013 CSS cleanup\n\u2013 check behaviour on changelist.\n\u2013 check errors below fields.\nplease add your thoughts about the current implementation (incl. variable names etc.) and keep in mind that we\u00b4re looking for the most simple solution.\n. TODO: only show \"X\" for fk and generics when the field is not empty\n. TODO: show result-counter and show a message if no results are found.\n. @parsch: long text within fk- and generic-input overflow the remove-symbol\n@parsch: with m2m-autocompletes, the list is much smaller than the div-wrapper\n@parsch: hovers (div, input) are not very nice (probably an issue with djangos fine dom-structure)\n. \u2013 CSS cleanup done\n\u2013 functionality on changelist not possible due to a bug in django 1.3 (update the grappelli-docs accordingly)\n. \u2013 error-fields ok\n\u2013 remove-link is only visible if there\u00b4s a value\n. \u2013 width of menu-items with m2m-autocompletes is fixed.\n. \u2013 clicking labels with autocomplets is fixed.\n. idea: add an \"X\" to m2m-autocomplets in order to remove all items. remove the \"X\" button for every single item ... instead, remove the item by clicking it.\n. @parsch: please check the width of m2m-fields within tabular-inlines.\n. @parsch: the results are now being shown as the first item within ul.menu. instead of <li><a>xxx</a></li> we have <li><span>xxx</span></li> ... needs to be styled. this line is always there (even in case of a server-error).\n. @parsch: some styling-issues with updating jquery & jqueryUI (e.g. the datepicker). uncomment line 50 in grappelli.js and you\u00b4ll see what\u00b4s wrong. some other styles might need a fix as well.\n. @parsch: elements within fk, m2m and generic wrapper are having a slightly different vertical position (with inlines, the items are not centered vertically). the same is true for the remove-link.\n. @parsch: IMO, we need to distinguish single lookups from multiple lookups with adapting the search-icon accordingly (for either related-lookups and autocomplete-lookups). because even with related-lookups, it\u00b4s not obvious that multiple items can be selected. minimal change to the search-icon > far more user-friendly.\n. not necessarily: distinguish by type (object, file), by action (single, multiple) or by type and action. IMO, type is not as important as action.\n. @parsch: check width if several fields are within a row.\n. fixed with the 2.3.4-release.\n. this could be done with a) adding all necessary ui\u2013translation files and b) loading the file based on the defined django\u2013language with:\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n        var url = \"{% get_static_prefix %}grappelli/jquery/i18n/ui.datepicker-{{ LANGUAGE_CODE }}.js\";\n        grp.jQuery.getScript(url);\n    </script>\nhowerver, not every language is available with jquery\u2013ui. can we still use that? any opinions?\n. you mean with adding a custom grappelli templatetag and hardcoded datepicker languages?\n. @pawlyk yes, manually with customized templates (just add the necessary jquery-ui language files).\n. @pawlyk please refer to the google user\u2013group for asking questions. this is an issue tracker. thank you!\n. seems possible after we updated jquery/jquery\u2013UI (see #378). but we don't update jquery with 2.4.x, because there are backwards\u2013incompatible changes.\n. closing this since there's no viable solution (file endings are not equal with django language codes and jquery UI). besides, it's easy to add the files yourself.\n. @parsch: overriding the template is done with admin.ModelAdmin.\ne.g.,\nchange_list_template = \"admin/change_list.html\"\nversus\nchange_list_template = \"admin/change_list_filters.html\"\n. @parsch: results should be behind the sidebar\u2013filters.\n. fixed with 2.4.2\n. did you test with django 1.3? I\u00b4m asking because grappelli is always developed against the latest official release.\n. works fine for me (OSX 10.6.8, safari 5.0.5) with django 1.3.\nI\u00b4m sorry, but djangos trunk is too hard to follow ... especially with 1.4, since some admin-related changes are implemented.\n. can you add more details (e.g. looking at the code and see what\u00b4s happening)? for me, it\u00b4s hard to debug this issue since I\u00b4m not able to reproduce it.\nthis problem doesn\u00b4t exist when you\u00b4re not using grappelli, right?\n. yes, login would be helpful.\n. the wrong (original admin interface) css are being loaded ... it\u00b4s a setup issue. do you use staticfiles?\n. WHAT didn\u00b4t you install with pip? grappelli? no - you don\u00b4t have to use pip (although I recommend using it).\n. the problem is not pip though ... the problem is that the wrong css is being loaded and that\u00b4s related to your django-setup (staticfiles, media_root etc.). sorry, but there\u00b4s not much I can help with.\n. that\u00b4s a bad place to discuss it here ... are you on IRC/skype?\n. the problem is definitely a wrong setup. BUT: if you\u00b4re asking a question and/or don\u00b4t understand how things work, please use the google-group. this is an issue-tracker.\n. if no images are loaded and/or paths/urls are wrong ... setup issue!\nread the django-docs about how to server media and static files. sorry ... nothing we can do about that.\n. @adaaif: yes, but of course that doesn\u00b4t mean your media/static-setup is fine (that\u00b4s a totally different story).\n. @adaaif : sorry ;-)\n. TinyMCEAdmin.js is not using the grappelli-theme (it\u00b4s using o2k7). if you\u00b4re using grappelli, you need to add tinymce_setup.js (or something similar). can you give that a try and let me know if it works?\nnote: it probably makes sense to remove TinyMCEAdmin.js from the repo.\n. no, you shouldn\u00b4t use TinyMCEAdmin.js at all ... you should use tinymce_setup.js. that said, this file is just an example of how a configuration-file could look like (please read the tinymce-docs in order to understand what\u00b4s happening exactly).\nif you add tinymce and tinymce_setup (both which are included with grappelli), there shouldn\u00b4t be an error. I\u00b4ve tested with firefox, safari & chrome (both windows and OSX).\nif you\u00b4re having questions on how to integrate TinyMCE in general, please use the google-group.\n. did you try with django 1.3?\n. honestly ... I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s a grappelli-error. otherwise hundreds of users won\u00b4t be able to use the filter drop-down and I don\u00b4t think that\u00b4s the case. I\u00b4m pretty sure it\u00b4s because of 1.4.0a ... and grappelli is always developed against the latest official release.\n. if you read my last comment you'll see that grappelli is not developed with djangos trunk. \n. I\u00b4m closing this ticket since it\u00b4s related to djangos trunk version. docs have been updated and a note has been added that grappelli is always developed against the latest stable django release.\n. of course, it will get fixed once grappelli is compatible with django 1.4\n. grp.jQuery needs to be there, otherwise no js will work ... we already had that issue with another ticket and it turned out it\u00b4s been a setup issue. are you sure that your javascript-files are being loaded correctly?\n. can you check why grp.jQuery is not there? because it should be. as mentioned before, if grp.jQuery is not there, a lot of stuff won\u00b4t work as expected.\n. which django-version are you using?\n. I\u00b4m using django 1.3 and chrome 14.0.835.94 beta ... can\u00b4t reproduce this bug.\n. when you say \"problem reproduced\" ... are you referring to the login-page only or (as vitorh45 described) every page?\n. are you all using grappelli 2.3.3+?\nsee\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/commit/68e0cc7fe2e573d1dab0691c76b949a2f7d325eb\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/commit/0a8fc04141fef96a08ef227adb3085471cfff9b0\n. I\u00b4m closing this since it seems to be solved with 2.3.3+\n. besides, the ui-sortable-helper class gets overriden by the predelete class.\n. grappelli-skin-default.css, line 748 seems to be the problem:\n.collapse.open.predelete > h4.collapse-handler\n. definitely works ... did you define the related lookups according to the docs? http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#related-lookups. I\u00b4m sorry but we had to change the related-lookups a bit with 2.3+ because of some smaller issues with the former version. it\u00b4s all mentioned in the docs as well as the changelog and should now work very stable.\n. see http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-grappelli/en/latest/customization.html#inline-sortables ... besides that, the latest official release is 2.3.3 (e.g. via pip install).\n. you are so right! accepted (and hopefully fixed soon).\n. fixed, see http://sehmaschine.github.com/django-grappelli/\n. sorry, but I can\u00b4t guarantee the tinymce-files to be up-to-date all the time. that\u00b4s just to much effort. thanks for the patch though.\n. IMO, this should be done with classes instead of alignments. any objections?\n. I\u00b4m closing this for now since I\u00b4m sure this is better solved with using classes.\n. I did unterstand your proposal. what I don\u00b4t understand is why you want to use text-alignments instead of classes (of course you can define classes which will define text-alignments).\nconsider this: you let your editors add alignments to paragraphs and one day you\u00b4d like to change these alignments ... what do you do? IMO, text-alignment is completely redundant (if not dangerous) with \"rich text editing\".\n. no, I don\u00b4t have a better idea. but I guess that you can simply override content_css with tinymce_setup.js.\n. 1. if you use grappelli.dashboard, please remove all admin-tools-apps from your INSTALLED_APPS\n2. which version of grappelli are you using?\n. grappellli is always developed againt the latest official django-release. using django 1.3 will resolve the problem.\n. thanks for the information. unfortunately, there\u00b4s a bunch of backwards-incompatible changes with 1.4 ... that\u00b4s why we stick with 1.3 for now. that said, customizing the admin-interface should be a lot easier with the final release of 1.4 (so we\u00b4re looking forward to that).\n. updating screenshots are already on the todo-list. maybe we\u00b4ll add screencasts as well. but I think that another github-project is to hard to maintain (I rather spend my time improving grappelli/filebrowser). sorry.\n. fixed with the autocomplete-branch since it\u00b4ll be merged soon.\n. please use the google-group to ask question. thanks.\n. nope. bug!\n. thanks. we\u00b4ll check that issue asap.\n. what version of django did you use for this fix?\n. no, that\u00b4s fine. I just asked because most of the recent request are related to django 1.4 ... \n. thanks. we\u00b4ll fix that.\n. note: I\u00b4ll deleted the files with the autocomplete-branch since this branch is going to be merged very soon. closing the ticket since the merge will fix the issue.\n. can you explain that a bit more? what \"Meta class\"?\n. seems a bit overdone for what we\u00b4re trying to do, but we\u00b4ll keep it in mind. thanks for the hint though.\nbtw: we\u00b4ll use compass for the next version of grappelli.\n. we just need the grid \u2013 and with that in mind, it\u00b4s overdone (not in general, but for us). besides, compass nicely integrates with blueprint.\nsorry, but I don\u00b4t understand your last question. grappelli has the same amount of fields, it just looks different.\n. closing this since the next version will be based on compass (and I don\u00b4t understand the second question). if compass integrates with bootstrap, we\u00b4ll re-discuss this issue.\n. We will check Bootstrap with the next major release again.\nBut I have to say, that this (https://wrapbootstrap.com/themes/admin) is not really convincing. Some of these themes look nice at first, but weird when it comes to the details \u2014 though I'm currently not sure if the reason is Bootstrap or the actual implementation.\n. I doubt that this is easily possible ... but we'll check it!\n. well, that would be interesting of course. but before you start working on something like that ... if it's not easy, what exactly are the benefits of doing this? just to say we're using bootstrap? from my point of view, it doesn't make customizing the admin interface easier (maybe even harder) for anyone using grappelli. moreover, we need to adapt with every new version of bootstrap, but we're already having a hard time keeping up with django.contrib.admin (and their inexplicable updates).\nthat being said, I don't wanna block this issue. if you're having some spare time to invest doing a prototype, that's much appreciated (though it doesn't mean we're going to use Bootstrap).\n. @BertrandBordage we're totally open to change our workflow and I basically agree with what you've written. my doubts primarily arise from the admin projects done with bootstrap. for example, the link above posted by leonardo: when I look at these screenshots ... I'm like WTF!\nbut: maybe it doesn't have to be this way. maybe I just need someone to convince me that grappelli won't look that shitty if we use bootstrap.\n. I personally don't care about the \"theme\" ... that could be changed later. what's important in my opinion is that we have the necessary structure/options (e.g. object\u2013tools, footer, date\u2013hierarchy and other stuff). from my experience it's not that easy \u2013 you can't just add boostrap elements to an existing DOM and assume that it will look ok. \nmaybe the misunderstanding is this: when I talk about the design, I'm not referring to colors/fonts/or presentational markup in general. I'm talking about (for example) pixel perfect placement of a filter element beneath a searchbar. If we're able to solve that issue, I'm more than happy to re\u2013evaluate bootstrap for the next major release of grappelli.\n. I\u00b4m also not happy about that situation. but working on grappelli is unpaid \u2013\u00a0so we need to focus on what\u00b4s important for us and our customers. sorry.\nbesides, you\u00b4re free to add patches in order to solve these issues.\n. overriding a change-list template is exactly the same with grappelli and the standard admin interface. but I don\u00b4t understand your question \u2013 why do you need to find out if grappelli is being used? I mean, you\u00b4re the developer, so you should know. guess I\u00b4m missing something, right?\n. alright, I see.\nunfortunately, I don\u00b4t know how to figure out if grappelli is being used. guess you need to check INSTALLED_APPS. on a template-level, you probably need to write a custom template-tag.\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions.\nthanks,\npatrick\n. @parsch: could you please take a look at this one? thanks.\n. yes, I know. but I haven\u00b4t give this much thoughts so far ... do you think it\u00b4s better to throw an error?\n. about your first problem: did you add apps like \"myapp\" and others like \"project.myapp\" to your INSTALLED_APPS?\nthe comparison with how django handles such cases is a good argument. I agree that we should take the same path.\n. I\u00b4ve tried to solve this but I didn\u00b4t find a solution since we\u00b4re able to define models like \"django.contrib.*\" ... which is not in the list of registered items.\nI\u00b4d say we have to stick with the current solution. it\u00b4s not perfect, but on the other hand you shouldn\u00b4t have a problem if you define your dashboard-models like the one you add to INSTALLED_APPS.\nif for example\n\"project.blog\"\nis in your INSTALLED_APPS\nyou need to add something like\n\"project.blog.models.BlogEntry\"\nto your dashboard\n. closing this one since #46 adds a better explanation.\n. grappelli is a requirement for the filebrowser.\nbut you don\u00b4t need to use grappellis tinymce-theme. did you try it with the default tinymce skin?\n. closing this since no reply is given. I guess this is being solved with using the original tinymce-skin.\n. grappelli doesn\u00b4t include all buttons that come with tinymce \u2013\u00a0it\u00b4s only a minimal theme.\n. unfortunately, I don\u00b4t know a quick fix since I\u00b4ve never used pagebreak \u2013 but if you find a solution, please let me know.\n. thx. I\u00b4ll check that and update asap.\n. what url reverse error?\n. you could use a filebrowsefield or an imagefield with the clearablefileinput-widget that comes with the filebrowser (see http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-filebrowser/en/3.3.0/fieldswidgets.html#clearablefileinput). but the question is more related to the filebrowser than to grappelli. \n. how can I reproduce this error?\n. now I see what you mean \u2013\u00a0thanks for the clarification.\nI\u00b4ll take a look at this. The mentioned code shouldn\u00b4t even be relevant because of if request.GET.get('query_string', None):\n. just by taking a quick look at your patch I\u00b4m having a question: you mainly seem to remove image-references in css-files (as well as some grid-styles). doesn\u00b4t this affect the grappelli-layout? sorry, but I\u00b4ve never been using cache storage: can you explain your patch a bit?\nthanks.\n. I see ... you just removed images which are not used. thanks. we\u00b4ll test the patch with our environment an merge asap (this may take a few days since we\u00b4re in the middle of a bigger filebrowser-update).\n. thanks a lot.\n. sorry, but this patch doesn\u00b4t seem to work ... did you tested this without the \"future\" imports? IMO, {% load url from future %} is missing.\n. did you test with the latest official django-release? because grappelli is not developed against djangos trunk. and since we never came across this issue, I suspect it\u00b4s more related to django than to grappelli.\n. interesting. do you get any js-errors?\nbesides, can you please send\na) the model and admin-options you\u00b4re using for the inlines and\nb) the relevant part of the traceback\nthanks.\n. the next version will be namespaced.\n. I could just now reproduce this bug. we\u00b4ll take a look at this!\n. working on it ...\n. bug should be fixed (dynamic-form is now being added correctly). please let me know if you\u00b4re still having problems with this issue.\n. should be solved.\n. how do you refer to the models when adding them to the admin (register ...).\n. thanks. will update the docs.\n. I\u00b4ve updated the docs in order to reflect the issue mentioned by @dannyadair. unfortunately, I\u00b4m not able to reproduce the original issue (which seems to be a different one).\n. docs are updated.\n. mainly because I don\u00b4t get the point. I mean ... we just can\u00b4t support all 3rd-party-apps which are based on the admin-interface and are not compatible with grappelli. where does it lead to?\nbesides, if treemenu needs these icons, grappellis look & feel is gone ... so I suggest using the original admin-interface for that case anyway.\nthis is an unsatisfactory situation for us as well. but as long as it\u00b4s not possible to skin djangos admin-interface in a clean and easy way, we have to make decisions like this.\n. that\u00b4s a reasonable argument and I already said I\u00b4m not satisfied with the situation as is. nevertheless, we\u00b4re not able to support all 3rd-party-apps (that\u00b4s just not possble because it\u00b4s too much effort and we do these projects in our spare time).\nthat said, if you add a pull-request chances are much higher it\u00b4s being implemented (if it doesn\u00b4t interfere with other stuff and it\u00b4s just about adding some images).\n. grappelli doesn\u00b4t include any translations. so it\u00b4s mainly a django-issue. that being said, we should take care that the layout doesn\u00b4t break even if the text-phrase is too long.\n. looks good to me.\njust a small hint if you submit a patch:\nfor backwards-compatibility, I would leave the callback as is (for now).\n. do you still want to submit a patch for this? otherwise I\u00b4m going to close this issue ... although I\u00b4m happy to implement your patch if you find the time to submit it.\n. alright. thanks for the info.\n. please resubmit if that\u00b4s possible. thanks.\n. a question to begin with: what exactly would you do with pre-/post-content functionality?\n. added pre- and post-content. please note that you need to add the relevant DOM yourself ... e.g.\nself.children.append(modules.AppList(\n            _('Administration'),\n            collapsible=True,\n            column=1,\n            css_classes=('collapse open',),\n            pre_content='<div class=\"module\"><div class=\"row\"><p>Adding a <a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Link</a></p></div></div>',\n            post_content='<div class=\"module\"><div class=\"row\"><p>Adding a <a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Link</a></p></div></div>',\n            models=('django.contrib.auth.models.User','django.contrib.auth.models.Group',),\n        ))\n. sorry, I don\u00b4t understand your last comment ... how is feincms connected with grappelli?\n. I still don\u00b4t understand this. as far as I know, feincms doesn\u00b4t support grappelli ... am I wrong?\n. basically, you\u00b4re right \u2013 grappelli replaces the admin site. but if feincms doesn\u00b4t support our templates resp. DOM structure, it won\u00b4t work.\nbackground: because the HTML/CSS of the original admin is a bit of a mess, we are not able to work on the basis with grappelli since it makes the js-part (which again ist just a workaround for some django-limitations) almost impossible. bit of an awkward situation, but there\u00b4s not much we can do about that right now.\n. sorry for that. are you able to split the pull-requests?\n. I\u00b4d prefer a pull-request for every self-contained change/fix. thanks a lot.\n. sorry ... I didn\u00b4t know you can do only one pull request a time. in that case, just leave it as is. I\u00b4m pretty new to git, so I\u00b4ve never used cherry-pick, but I\u00b4ll give that a try.\n. sorry, but I need to close this request ... I\u00b4m not able to see what\u00b4s more or less important and how the different requests relate to each other (and/or to feincms). please re-add the request with additional information on what exactly you want to change and why. thanks.\n. how does tinymce detect the language automatically?\n. besides, that\u00b4s about 1900 additional files ... and the grappelli-plugin for tinymce doesn\u00b4t support all these languages. not sure about this.\n. we\u00b4ve decided to not include all languages (tinymce has been updated with 2.3.8)\n. I\u00b4m ok with adding this if (and only if) the given grappelli-style is preserved. can you send a screenshot?\n. this is just for tinymce, right? because there's other popups in the admin interface as well (eg related lookups). how do we handle these other cases? because IMO it's important to have a coherent solution - not different kind of popups. what do you think?\n. in that case I\u00b4m against merging this (sorry). but consistency is a major issue for us \u2013\u00a0and having different solutions for popups/dialogs within a interface is something I don\u00b4t like at all.\nthanks for the effort though. if there\u00b4s any chance we\u00b4re able to create a decent and consistent solution, we should re-discuss this issue.\n. yes. but that's a backwards-incompatible change with django. so, once 1.4 is released, we'll update grappelli. \n. see #91\n. what version are you using? because I think we just fixed that bug.\n. see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/commit/8997ce912d3e638973507c7edde50a7c05a2cf1c\n. right, it\u00b4s solved with the master-branch, but there\u00b4s no update on pypi yet. I\u00b4m leaving this open for reference although the issue is already fixed.\n. closing this since 2.3.6 will be relased pretty soon.\n. I\u00b4m pretty sure this is related to the tinymce-version (3.4.2) we\u00b4re using with grappelli ... it seems to work with tinymce 3.4.7., so it will be solved when we update tinymce.\n. probably with 2.4 (once django 1.4 is out). but I don\u00b4t know since I\u00b4m only assuming that it comes down to the tinymce-version. if it\u00b4s really an issue with tinymce, I\u00b4m going to update instantly \u2013\u00a0but I need more information on the subject in order to do so ... \n. if you need it fast, you could add a pull-request. please keep in mind that we overwrite some plugins in order to preserve the grappelli-style ...\n. tinymce updated with 2.3.8-release\n. @parsch: isn\u00b4t it better to add grappelli-like arrow-buttons?\n. @honi: doesn\u00b4t work for me (tested with firefox). does it work for you?\n. I\u00b4m on 13.0.1 as well ... you added the line to the stop-function of the sortable, right? \n. sorry ... yes, it does work. the behaviour just seems strange to me (and with all the different inlines I\u00b4m testing with I got confused). so, yes it works, but I\u00b4m not fully convinced we should use this.\n. looks good, thanks!\n. yep. any idea how to solve this?\n. I don\u00b4t see how this could be solved due to browser-issues (since we are not able to serialize a filefield).\n. #134 is a possible solution.\n. what if we\na) serialize the fields (for each row) when loading the changeform.\nb) add the result to each row (just a hidden div with the field-values).\nc) on save, we serialize again (like we do now) and compare the values with the hidden div.\ncould that work?\n. if the values are unchanged \u2013 we don\u00b4t need to save them, because they are already saved. right?\n. I don\u00b4t quite get the point: if you\u00b4re having an extra form with initial data and you don\u00b4t change any values ... why would you want to save this row then? because when I follow your example, all extra forms will automatically be saved (no matter what I do). am I missing something?\n. but we shouldn\u00b4t rely on that.\n. sorry, but I\u00b4m not able to follow this discussion anymore (IMO your argumentation goes in circles). please add a new ticket and try to explain what exactly you want/need to solve. thanks.\n. take a look at #134 ... that\u00b4s a possible solution IMO.\n. I\u00b4m using django-positions as well, mainly for models which have list-editables on a changelist.\nwhen using django-positions with inline-sortables it doesn\u00b4t work (at least that\u00b4s my experience). I haven\u00b4t been looking into django-positions to figure out what exactly does break there \u2013 but I\u00b4m pretty sure this is not an issue we can solve with grappelli, right?\n. any updates on this one?\n. I\u00b4m closing this issue for now. please re-open with additional information if needed. thanks.\n. can you explain your patch? what does it actually solve and why?\n. ah, ok. you know that we always develop against the latest official release of django, right? so, this \"error\" is intentional. we\u00b4ll update grappelli once 1.4 is released (because there are backwards-incompatible changs with the admin-interface).\n. I don\u00b4t think that\u00b4s something which should be configurable with grappelli. I personally don\u00b4t like/use the app-index at all, but it should be solved with django (and not with grappelli).\nI\u00b4ve mentioned this several times before: django orders your models based on apps. but I\u00b4m pretty sure, no customer/editor is interested in the structure of your \"apps\". to me, this doesn\u00b4t make sense at all ... still a \"-1\" on \"fixing\" this with grappelli.\n. well, I think the whole admin-interface has been built with developers in mind: e.g., the index-page is just a list of \"INSTALLED APPS\" (try to explain that to an editor).\n. closing this since it\u00b4s not a grappelli-issue (although I hope that it will be solved with django).\n. -1 for this \"solution\".\n. which version of grappelli are you using?\n. this should be solved with the master-branch. please reopen the ticket if the issue still exists.\n. thanks \u2013 just committed your code.\n. yes, that\u00b4s the intended behaviour. any problems with this?\n. sorry, of course you don\u00b4t need to populate the sortable-field but one of the other fields with any inline ... if the serialization of all inline-fields returns something, the sortable-field gets populated.\n. any js-errors? did you do the setup of the sortables according to the docs?\n. now it\u00b4s clear: serializing a file-field doesn\u00b4t work. so unfortunately, the sortables are not working with a single file-field. and I don\u00b4t think there\u00b4s a solution, because of the way file-fields are handled with html.\n. closing this one. if you feel that your issue hasn\u00b4t been solved yet, please add another (working and tested) pull-request. thanks.\n. see #91\n. I\u00b4m sorry but this pull-request seems quite strange to me (see my 2 comments on your requests).\n. 1. just added a fix for the term \"1 result\" with pagionations.\n2. you need to add missing translations directly with django.contrib.admin (I think they use transifex).\n3. I\u00b4ve added your other translation fixes as well (thanks for that).\nbut no, the templates from django-admin-tools are being used for the dashboard excklusively.\n. is this solved with django admin 1.3? because relatedobjectlooup.js is basically a copy ...\n. I\u00b4m pretty sure django handles raw-id-fields and radio-lists as well (but I didn\u00b4t check that).\nhowever, if you add a pull-request I\u00b4m going to merge it.\n. thanks. I\u00b4ve decided to remove title_url from the docs (use pre_content or post_content instead).\n. thanks. no pull-request needed ... we\u00b4ll check that.\n. thanks. merged the other pull-request though.\n. what if we\na) serialize the fields (for each row) when loading the changeform.\nb) add the result to each row (just a hidden div with the field-values).\nc) on save, we serialize again (like we do now) and compare the values with the hidden div.\n. see also #96\n. @funkybob: could you add more details please? we\u00b4re not able to reproduce it by what you\u00b4ve written.\n. @funkybob: what version of grappelli are you using? 2.3.8? moreover, why do you define \"pk\" as an autocomplete_lookup_fields (shouldn\u00b4t \"unter\" be the autocomplete)? did you check the serialisation (e.g. with using console.log on the javascript)?\nfor debugging, you could add console.log(fields) after:\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/templates/admin/edit_inline/tabular.html#L265\nwhich should log something in your case ...\n. do you want to try with 2.3.8? because 2.4 is not yet released ... if the problem exists with 2.3.8 it\u00b4s actually a \"bug\" \u2013 with 2.4. it\u00b4s just not finished yet.\n. thanks a lot for checking that \u2013 we\u00b4ll take a look at the 2.4 branch.\n. should work with the 2.4-branch now (the sortable-exclude issue hasn\u00b4t been solved though).\n. closing this in favor of #134 which offers a solution (not implemented with the 2.4-branch yet).\n. totally agree \u2013 will update to 2.3.7 on the weekend (I didn\u00b4t check with 2.5). thanks!\n. see #91\n. see #91\n. well, grappelli 2.4+ won\u00b4t work with django 1.3 anyway (because django introduced some backwards-incompatible changes with the admin-interface). I have to look through all the changes coming with django 1.4, but yes \u2013 if the tags are not used with the django-admin we can remove them. btw: the branch to work on for django 1.4 compatibility is grappelli_2_4 (just in case you wanna add a pull-request).\n. hi,\nwe\u00b4re working on it ... but there\u00b4s no schedule yet since we\u00b4re updating\nall CSS to compass.\nI could say we\u00b4re probably done in about 3 weeks, but don\u00b4t take this for\ngranted.\nbest,\npatrick\n2012/4/16 Simon Heimler <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nHi there,\nany Idea when Grappelli is ready for Django 1.4?\nI've tryed the Grappelli 2.4 Branch but it didn't work for me.\nGreets, Simon\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/91#issuecomment-5147860\n. all issues mentioned here are solved with the 2.4-branch.\n. no, you\u00b4re not using the static-tag, do you?\n. I\u00b4m talking about {% static \"...\" %} ... like with the original admin from 1.4\n. you don\u00b4t need to since I\u00b4m also changing the templates ... I\u00b4ll check your other changes and implement them asap.\n. besides \u2013 would you agree that we need to use {% static \"admin/...\" %} instead of {% static \"grappelli/...\" %} and rename the /static/grappelli/ to /static/admin/ ... otherwise we are not able to overwrite the original static-files ... right?\n. looks good, thanks \u2026 we\u00b4ll do it that way.\n. I\u00b4m not sure I can follow ... but I\u00b4ve done some tests with my current grappelli_2_4_branch and most things seem to work fine (besides the multiple sorting on the changelist). so I guess we can take that as a basis.\n. my thoughts ...\nwe have these 2 folders:\n/static/admin/\n/static/grappelli/\n\nthe first folder (/static/admin/) is needed because there\u00b4s hardcoded stuff with the django admin\u00a0expecting files to be found within that folder (which is {% static \"admin/...\" %}).\nwith grappelli, we can use a different static-tag (which is {% static \"grappelli/...\" %}, but only where we\u00b4re able to change the tag (and not for any hardcoded stuff).\nI agree that we don\u00b4t need to duplicate files, because collectstatic will find these files anyway. however, since we\u00b4re having at least minor changes within every js, I\u00b4m +1 on duplicating all admin-files.\n. we\u00b4re close.\n. no, sorry \u2013\u00a0we\u00b4re doing this in our spare time and it\u00b4s hard to guess what our customers are up to.\n. same with filters ... check all overlay for closing when\na) clicking somewhere else\nb) ESC\n. with django 1.4/grappelli 2.4, this issue should be solved ... right? because when using collectstatic, the gis-images are there and since ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX is deprecated, the path/url to the images should be fine as well. \n. theoretically speaking, the field with the default value should be excluded from the serialization when doing the sorting ... right?\n. because the sortable field reacts to any inputs/changes by a user \u2013\u00a0but a default value is not a changed value ... so why should the sortable field react to that field? am I missing something? do we need to re-define the sortables and if yes, what could a (new) definition be?\n. @funkybob: no, that\u00b4s not an issue. did you define blank=True and null=True for your sortable field? if not, you should do so.\nthe example you mentioned (with the 3 fields) should definitely work \u2013 this is something we\u00b4re using for almost every project.\n. I\u00b4ve just tested with jsfiddle and\nvar fields = $(this).find(\"div.td :input[value);\nDOES pick up hidden inputs.\n???\n. see http://jsfiddle.net/sehmaschine/Myc29/ ... this could also include file-fields (although I don\u00b4t quite like the syntax with the field-loop).\n. I\u00b4ve never came across hidden inputs within 2 and 4 (at least not inputs which could/should be changed with having an effect on sortables). do you have an example?\n. 1. what do you mean with \"... the hidden inputs at position 2\"? which \"hidden inputs\"?\n2. and I still don\u00b4t understand why you wanna select fields with default values ... yes, it might be the solution for your problem, but theoretically speaking it\u00b4s not a good idea IMHO (because it doesn\u00b4t work with extra-rows).\nhowever, you might wanna take a look at #134 ... I\u00b4ve update the jsfiddle in order to work properly with file-fields and default values (hope I didn\u00b4t miss anything).\n. IMO #134 offers a proper solution (codewise, it\u00b4s not perfect but it deals with file-fields and ignores default values).\n. closing this in favor of #134 which offers a solution.\nnote: with my last question (nr. 1) I\u00b4ve been asking for examples of \"hidden inputs\" on position 2 ... these inputs currently don\u00b4t exist in my opinion and I still don\u00b4t understand what kind of inputs you\u00b4d like to see there.\n. thanks for the hint \u2013 we\u00b4re working on django 1.4 compatibility!\n. see #91\n. fixed the first issue, but decided to not go for the second one (maybe I don\u00b4t fully understand the benefits).\n. we often define custom change forms with overriding the grappelli change form (e.g. for changing object-tools).\nwhat exactly is not working for you?\n. why would you want to extend the change-form if you need to override it (for all objects)? when you add change_form_base, the same problem occurs with this template, right (if I extend change_form_base)?\nI agree that django admin templates aren\u00b4t very customazation friendly, but I\u00b4m not sure we\u00b4re talking about a bad design decision here. I\u00b4m ok with finding a better solution, but adding a _base template (which we need to do for every other template as well) doesn\u00b4t sound sensible to me.\n. I agree with everything you say here (thanks for the explanation). we\u00b4ll discuss that issue and may implement the _base templates.\n. sorry, but our goal with grappelli is to NOT add locales ... IMO we should use the jquery-localization for this one (if that\u00b4s possible). the reason we don\u00b4t add locales with grappelli is that it adds another layer of complexity (using transifex, keeping the locales up-to-date etc). appreciate your effort though.\n. if you download jqueryUI you\u00b4ll find the datepicker-locales ...\n. besides, if you\u00b4re willing to add a transifex-project and manage (!) that project for grappelli-locales, I\u00b4ll think about it.\n. hmm, \"done\" is part of the datepicker, see http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#buttonbar\ntelling from my experience with django-filebrowser: you don\u00b4t wanna do it!\n. closing this for now since different topics have been mentioned. please add a new ticket with a specific description. thanks!\n. thanks. FYI: both trunk and grappelli_2_4 are under development. for production use, please refer to the releases (tags or pypi).\n. can\u00b4t reproduce with either 2_3 and 2_4\n. see #91\n. see #91\n. see #91\n. I think it\u00b4s not possible to allow for several date formats with the jquery-datepicker ... is it?\n. can\u00b4t reproduce \u2013 for me, the typed date has a white background when the calendar is opened.\n. see #91\n. it\u00b4s not because of the tinymce version.\nnote to myself: it\u00b4s the onsubmit function with the html-file (pastword.html).\n. is there an english site?\n. thanks \u2013 it looks like a decent app, but without an english documentation ... sorry.\n. hmm, english translation is good ... and I\u00b4d love to get rid of tinymce and I like the redactor-style (the general look & feel is much better compared with tinymce) but: do you really think that editor is already working with a productive environment? I\u00b4ve been playing with the demo and unfortunately it doesn\u00b4t seem mature (e.g. indent/outdent not working, senseless functions like font-color and font-background, no obvious method to change blockformats, no post cleanup, link and image classes missing, strange code like img style=\"cursor: default;\"  ...).\na bit too much from my point of view. and I\u00b4m not a fan of tinymce at all \u2013\u00a0but replacing some crap with something else that\u00b4s not really working ... \n. thanks \u2013 good find.\n. you mean the error pops up with jquery-UI? if so, there\u00b4s not much we can do about it ...\ndoes it work when you remove jquery-UI?\n. what do you mean with \"add attachment\" resp. \"delete attachment\"?\n. do you mean inlines? there\u00b4s nothing like an \"attachments admin page\", right?\nand yes, the add-inline buttons do work with the stable version of grappelli. please reopen the ticket with additional information (e.g. a screenshot) and exactly describe the issue (if it actually is an issue). thx.\n. here\u00b4s on overview of the js: http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-grappelli/en/latest/javascripts.html\nbut you don\u00b4t need django- or grappelli-js to use the datepicker \u2013 it\u00b4s jquery-UI.\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions. this is an issue-tracker. thanks!\n. where do we use function-based generic views with grappelli?\n. oh, right \u2013\u00a0forgot that we added these urls ... thx.\n. no, there\u00b4s currently no effort to collaborate with django-admin-tools (more). we think that it\u00b4s a great project, but there are some design decisions we don\u00b4t agree with. however, it should be easy to add custom menus/widgets/groups/modules (esp. with the DOM-documentation available with grappelli 2.4).\nI\u00b4m closing this issue since our philosophy is to keep grappelli as clean and minimal as possible (while extending flexiblity in order to add custom items). please reopen if you think I missed something or didn\u00b4t fully understand your proposal.\n. not sure I\u00b4m able to follow. you\u00b4re talking about 2 different issues, right? first, the \"other plugin\" and second the way we\u00b4re calling functions ...\n. closing this for now \u2013\u00a0please reopen if you have additional details.\n. @parsch: I personally prefer the old action styling (no backgrounds, a bit smaller and generally less intrusive). \n. @parsch: click filter, click filter again (not selecting anything), move mouse away \u2013\u00a0background of filter is black.\n. it serializes file-fields, but we\u00b4re still facing the issue with default values:\nwhen we serialize the row, we don\u00b4t know if a value is a default one or not (and we don\u00b4t have a chance to check that). so, every row with a default value will be serialized and the sortable value will be set ... but that doesn\u00b4t make sense for extra-rows with a default value (because I want this rows to be excluded if no other value than the default one is given).\ntherefore, we need to add a field with the initial value counter and onSubmit compare the value of that field with the new serialized value counter.\nUPDATE: instead of a counter we store the serialized row with a hidden-field.\none problem still remains:\nif the user changes a default value (e.g. change \"xxx\" to \"yyy\" with input_text_003) the row isn\u00b4t marked as being changed ... so far, that\u00b4s no problem. but if the user now manually deletes the value of the sortable field, the row is missing. this could be solved with using a hidden-field or a readonly-field with sortables.\nUPDATE: this problem is solved with comparing the serialized fields.\nbesides: most problems with selectors in the 2.4-branch are results of jquery (1.7.2) changing the behaviour of :input (compared to 1.6.2). that\u00b4s already updated with the latest version of the branch.\n. even better than mine. thanks a lot \u2013 will update the branch today and then we can do some testing.\n. I did some testing and unfortunately, it doesn\u00b4t work with your proposal: the main problem is that form-rows can be removed and the row-index is being updated. so if we store initial values with the row-index (I couldn\u00b4t think of another way), it\u00b4s starting to get complicated.\nany ideas?\n. after some additinal testing, it\u00b4s far more complicated: serializing initial values won\u00b4t work, since these \"initial values\" will change after submitting the form. so, if there\u00b4s an error and the page is displayed a 2nd time, the \"initial values\" are different than before ... therefore, we can\u00b4t use them.\nthe only chance for this to work is to somehow get the real initial values from django \u2013\u00a0but unfortunately, these values are not there.\n. how did you manage to get the default values? because that's what we actually need. \nbesides, we need the values on a per inline form row basis (not for the whole form).\n. using initial values doesn\u00b4t seem a proper (and clean) solution. so I tried something different (see last commit):\nit takes file-fields into account and I\u00b4ve added a setting \"sortable_excludes\" (either list or tuple) in order to define fields which should not have any effect on the ordering. I\u00b4ve done some pretty extensive testing and (so far) it works for all my test cases ...\nwhat I don\u00b4t like and/or could be improved:\na) the fields selector:\nvar fields = $(this).find(\"fieldset :input[value][value!=''][type!=radio][type!=checkbox],input:checked,input[type=file]\") ...\nmaybe this can be done easier? note that :input[value] has changed with the latest jquery-version.\nb) comparing value and sortable_excludes:\nif ($(this).val() && $(this).attr(\"name\") && $.inArray($(this).attr(\"name\").split(\"-\").pop(), sortable_excludes) == -1)\nwe need to use \"name\" since there are (custom) widgets (e.g. autocompletes) which add form-fields without the name-attribute (and therefore should be excluded).\nc) I didn\u00b4t check for performance. not sure if this is faster/slower compared with the previous solution based on \"serialize\".\nfeedback/testing is very much appreciated.\n. any complaints about this solution? otherwise, I\u00b4m going to close this ticket.\n. I\u00b4ve tested quite extensively and it seems to work. closing this for now.\n. a probably better solution is to focus the search-input when closing the related object window.\n. add options.wrapper_search.find(\"input\").focus(); to lookup_id with jquery.grp_autocomplete_m2m.js ... it works but means that the search-field being focussed onload (which is not what\u00b4s needed).\n. fixed\n. no, this is not related to inlines.\n. hmm, works fine for me (tested with fieldsets, tabular and stacked inlines). what do you mean with \"values are not displaying properly\".\nnote: with tabular-inlines, the class grp-readonly is misssing (but that\u00b4s just a design issue).\n. you\u00b4re right \u2013\u00a0it now works for me (with multiple fields as well) with the latest commit by parsch.\n. works for me \u2013 do you have an action with an intermediate page?\nI\u00b4ve added print request.POST.copy() to my custom action and \"_selected_action\" is there.\n. if I\u00b4m using \"select all\", request.POST.copy() gives me all records (_selected_action is limited to the records on the first page, but that\u00b4s intended behaviour I guess).\n. yes, I\u00b4m on the 2.4-branch.\ndon\u00b4t know why you can\u00b4t assign labels ... but we\u00b4re taking care about that (if you\u00b4re referring to github-issues).\nisn\u00b4t there only one \"select all\"? first, I\u00b4m clicking the checkbox on the top left \u2013\u00a0to select all items on the current page, then I\u00b4m using \"select all\" in the footer-area (right beneath the select-field for actions).\nplease not that the styling of the footer is not finished yet: e.g., \"select all\" shouldn\u00b4t be visible when loading the page.\n. we\u00b4re going with the django admin behaviour here \u2013\u00a0first select all items on the page, then you get the option to \"select all\". changing the two-step process is another discussion (I\u00b4m ok with the current behaviour, but I don\u00b4t use actions a lot).\n. should be fixed \u2013 please reopen the ticket if you\u00b4re still seeing errors. \n. 1) because it looks more centered (vertically), although it isn\u00b4t.\n2 and 3) hard to argue. to me, the old version looks more balanced/unified.\nmoreover, I\u00b4m not sure about the text-shadow with headlines, because of missing repitition.\nand I prefer the slightly bigger padding with form-rows (see 2.3.8).\n. @parsch: dashboard index shows models with font-style: normal, while app index show it bold. \n. @parsch: IMO, .grp-help could have a color like #999.\n. @funkybob: there\u00b4s a problem with hiding rows with inlines. the only attribute we get is field.is_hidden, but we don\u00b4t get line.is_hidden ... therefore, it\u00b4s hard to achieve this. any ideas?\nbesides, I\u00b4d consider this a django-bug.\n. This bug should be fixed with Django.\n. even worse with tabular inlines, where the \"X\" (of autocompletes, if given) is being moved to the right.\n. non-form-errors look ok (not sure if we can do any improvement there).\nin order to reproduce, the easiest way is to just add the errorlist with the template (search for non_form_errors with stacked.html and tabular.html).\n. field-errors and non-field-errors\n. besides, I\u00b4m not sure if the items should be red\n. any idea how to solve this? just add a 2nd jQuery-namespace?\n. inline.js (and inline.min.js) has never been available with grappelli. and it doesn\u00b4t make sense to include these files, since they won\u00b4t work anyway.\nsorry, but I don\u00b4t get the point about FeinCMS: this app is not compatible with grappelli in the first place, right?\ntheoretically speaking, I think it\u00b4s a good idea to keep 3rd-party-apps in mind ... on the other hand, we avoid conflicts if we use a distinct grp-namespace for jQuery.\n. that\u00b4s exactly what I\u00b4ve been thinking about ... I\u00b4ll test it.\n. interesting (works for me). prepopulate is not even part of the grappelli-javascripts.\n. @bjudson if collectstatic does not copy the file, there's something wrong with your setup ... that should definitely work. any details are appreciated.\n. django.jQuery is there ... and I\u00b4m not getting any js-errors. are you using the latest version?\n. very strange \u2013 I just checked again and I don\u00b4t get any js errors. I\u00b4ve tested with DEBUG = True (loading the original js) and DEBGU = False (loading the minified grappelli js).\nthe distinction between django.jQuery and grp.jQuery shouldn\u00b4t be a problem (this is done by purpose in order to namespace all grappelli javascripts). I don\u00b4t think this can cause the js-errors you\u00b4re getting.\nIs grp.jQuery defined? (e.g. testing with the firebug console)\n. thanks \u2013\u00a0I\u00b4ve removed the second media.js.\n. right, we\u00b4ll explain that better ... autocompletes are (currently) alternatives for related/m2m/generic lookups.\n. you\u00b4re using grappelli 2.3.8 instead of the 2.4-branch, right?\n. depends what you want ... master is not compatible with django 1.4 (see documentation).\n. no problem \u2013 we\u00b4re about to release grappelli 2.4 this week (actually, it should have been released last week already).\n. We assume that grappelli-users know how collectstatic works.\n. closing this one since it should work with stable/2.4.x ... please reopen the ticket if the problem still exists.\n. @parsch: empty li needs styling\n. I don\u00b4t fully understand your pull-request:\na) the original django templates use a different approach, right?\nb) if we use \"url from future\" and the new url-syntax, why only for a couple of templates (and not all of them)?\n. thanks \u2013 but that doesn\u00b4t really answer my two questions (or I just don\u00b4t get it).\n. Actually, I do have doubts ... because the first file you\u00b4ve changed (delete_selected_confirmation) already throws an error because of \"opts\" ...\nand I still don\u00b4t understand why we need \"url from future\" when the original admin interface doesn\u00b4t use it.\nsorry for being so sceptical, but your patch doesn\u00b4t seem to be tested.\n. ok. If you send a patch, please use the branch \"stable/2.4.x\" ... thanks! if your patch is tested, we\u00b4ll merge the changes.\n. @michaelmior as said before \u2013 well-tested (!!!) patches are welcome.\n. @michaelmior  please submit a patch against stable/2.4.x ... we\u00b4re about to release a new version within the next couple of days btw.\n. sorry, but I\u00b4m not able to follow \u2013\u00a0what \"a\"-tag are you talking about? which \"JS code\" looks for an \"a\"-tag within the URL? \nplease add some details. closing this in the meantime, since it\u00b4s not reproducable with the information given.\n. what do you mean with \"our project main template\"?\n. sorry, I don\u00b4t think I can follow ... you mean the admin interface base-template, right? because grappelli is not supposed to work with anything else than djangos admin interface ... am I missing something?\n. can you send me a screenshot of what you want to achieve?\nyou can override that file and add (for example) a top-section ...\n. well, in that case I\u00b4d override base.html ...\nI still don\u00b4t fully understand the background of this issue, but (for now) this seems to be a very rare case to me (and therefore, I wouldn\u00b4t support something like that out of the box).\n. did you add the field to your form? it should definitely work with generic relations ...\n. do you see the position-field?\nbesides: which version of grappelli and django are you using?\n. it\u00b4s\nsortable_field_name = \"position\"\nsee http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#inline-sortables\n(please reopen the ticket if it still doesn\u00b4t work)\n. no problem \u2013 seems like a feasible update. however, I don\u00b4t think FeinCMS works with grappelli anway \u2013\u00a0does it?\n. what do you mean with \"the updated tinyMCE\"?\n. you\u00b4re talking about this file, right?\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/stable/2.3.x/grappelli/static/grappelli/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/paste/pastetext.htm\n. ok \u2013 same plugin.\n. FYI: just released a new version (2.3.9), compatible with django 1.3\n. looks fine to me.\n. sorry ... what do you mean with \"add in the changes\"? they are already added ... the styling is missing for now, but @parsch will update soon.\n. nope, thanks.\n. done (available with 2.4.1).\n. what version of grappelli and filebrowser are you using? we just fixed this issue with the stable-branch ...\n. ok. I\u00b4m closing this since it\u00b4s already fixed. new releases will be available on pypi soon.\n. are you having a screenshot? because I\u00b4m not sure I can follow ... why do you need to scroll if the window size exceeds the popup width? which popup btw? are you talking about add-another?\n. alright, now I see (thanks for the clarification).\nI\u00b4m using chrome 21 as well, but I\u00b4m able to see the save-button (no need for scrolling). that being said, the window is too small (about 20 to 40px, I guess). we\u00b4ll take a look at this issue ...\n. @parsch: is this fixed?\n. I\u00b4m having the same setup, but I\u00b4m not able to reproduce this. the file actions.js is being loaded correctly?\n. if this problem still exists with 2.3.9 or 2.4.2, please reopen the ticket. I\u00b4m not able to reproduce this.\n. @DrMeers any idea when/why this happens?\n. @pedrospdc what do you mean with \"couldn\u00b4t handle\"?\n. @DrMeers so you think that 2.3.5 is more compatible with IE8? if so, why?\n. @DrMeers it should already be IE8 compatible (more or less). if you see any issues, please open a new ticket with details. but I\u00b4m not saying that grappelli will ever work perfectly with IE8 (that\u00b4s just not our main goal).\n. grappelli is always developed against the latest official release (which is 1.4.x right now). unfortunately, we don\u00b4t have the resources to always keep up-to-date with djangos master-trunk. therefore, I have to say ... no, django 1.5.x will be supported once it\u00b4s officialy released.\n. if it\u00b4s backwards compatible with 1.4.x, yes. otherwise no (sorry).\n. I would totally support that as well. question is: who\u00b4s going to submit a well\u2013tested patch?\n. can\u00b4t see the screenshot\n. hmm, can\u00b4t reproduce \u2013 looks good with my setup. any details?\n. well, it seems you don\u00b4t have change\u2013permissions!\n. @epicserve: your fix introduces change_url which has been removed with django recently. instead, I\u00b4m going to change the model\u2013list template.\n. the release is already out (2.4.2). just pip upgrade.\n. absolutely \u2013 if it works, we\u00b4ll accept the patch. please patch against stable/2.4.x.\nbesides, 2 minutes is a very long time ... how many foreign keys do you have? our test\u2013environment is pretty extensive (esp. with relationships), but I never wait that long (max. 10 seconds with hundreds of inlines).\n. what about this one? https://github.com/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light \nI didn\u00b4t test it ...\n. @BertrandBordage problem with django-ajax-selects: generic relations are missing.\n. I\u00b4m open to patches ... \n. @BertrandBordage I\u00b4ve added your changes to stable/2.4.x and I\u00b4m currently trying to cleanup the code ... can you explain why exactly you\u00b4ve chosen the given functions? e.g., any reason why you\u00b4re working with a function search_term, but without any filtering function (instead the filters are part of get_queryset)? More generally speaking, can you please explain your code ... thx.\n. see #239\n. the latest release is 2.4.1 (pypi).\n2.4.2 is the version of the master\u2013branch (next release, current development version).\nso, this looks fine to me ...\nconcerning the js, there shouldn\u00b4t be any difference between 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 \u2013 if you\u00b4re seeing any errors, please open another ticket. thanks.\n. @parsch: please take a look at this. the link to \"password reset\" needs to be styled and of course the reset\u2013form as well.\n. @camilonova pypi will be updated once the next release is due.\n. if django doesn\u00b4t support this, how could we add it (without using the python\u2013part of djangos admin interface)?\n. problem is ... the diff refers to options.py (a file which is not part of grappelli). I\u00b4ll take a closer look, but I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s possible (although I like to see the feature as well).\n. I think anyone can send a patch \u2013 if you add tests, chances are much better though.\n. closing this ticket for now (because it\u00b4s mainly related to django and not to grappelli), although I\u00b4d love to see this feature.\n. Are you sure you\u00b4ve cleared the cache and you\u00b4re loading the right files?\nbecause I\u00b4m not able to reproduce this (and I\u00b4m pretty sure this bug doesn\u00b4t exist).\n. I\u00b4ve checked again and I\u00b4m not able to reproduce this ... please re\u2013open the ticket if you think it\u00b4s a bug.\n. I\u00b4m using staticpatterns, but I\u00b4m still not able to reproduce this.\n@philwo you\u00b4re saying that grappellis jquery.js doesn\u00b4t get loaded. if that\u00b4s the case, there\u00b4s a lot of functionality which doesn\u00b4t work, right (e.g. autocompletes)? basically, not much of the admin will work as expected ... \n. since we\u00b4re about to do a new release, it\u00b4d be nice to solve this issue ... \n1. it seems that STATICFILES_FINDERS is not being used with runserver (I\u00b4m able to reproduce that).\n2. still, I\u00b4m not able to get django override the grappelli files (unless I\u00b4m adding \"django.contrib.admin\" before \"grappelli\" with INSTALLED_APPS).\nany additional information is helpful ... thx.\n. @maffacow since I\u00b4ve never been able to reproduce this issue, I need to rely on feedback. so far, I\u00b4m not sure what a \"fix\" could be ... \n. well ... you can debug, find the issue (if it actually exists) and submit a pull\u2013request. that\u00b4s the most straightforward way to solve it.\n. @ulmus that's a good point \u2013 we'll update the docs with that info.\n. @idboehman thanks for the hint, but I'm very certain that GRAPPELLI_INDEX_DASHBOARD is not related to the actions whatsoever. My guess is that this issue is caused by caching (could be browser\u2013cache, could be old .pyc\u2013files).\n. @zzart if you need a symlink there\u00b4s something wrong with your staticfiles setup ... all staticfiles should be found automatically when doing collectstatic.\n@tufelkinder djangos built\u2013in jquery is overriden by grappelli (there is no content with jquery.min.js).\n. @grafa but the file /static/admin/js/jquery.js is empty, see\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/static/admin/js/jquery.js\nanother idea \u2013\u00a0did you try running collectstatic with ignoring the original admin\u2013files?\npython manage.py collectstatic --ignore django.contrib.admin\n. @sdillinger well, haven't been able to reproduce this for 2+ years. I'm pretty sure this is not related to grappelli but your server/django setup.\n. @myii Thanks a lot for the research and the very detailed explanation. What you're saying makes sense indeed (still funny that I've never run across this issue with any projects we did).\n. see #791 . @BertrandBordage about the french locale: grappelli doesn\u00b4t include any translations (this all comes with django). the other changes look fine to me ... but why do you want to pull to master (instead of stable/2.4.x)?\n. about the translations: yes, you\u00b4re right \u2013 there are some strings not available with django.contrib.admin. on the other hand, adding translations means using transifex, managing that project et.al. ... but we rather concentrate on improving grappelli (not enough resources to do translations as well).\n. I\u00b4ve fixed the issue with id\u00b4s and autocompletes. we won\u00b4t add translations to grappelli and I\u00b4ve decided to not take action concerning the datepicker\u2013issue (waiting for a cleaner patch for that one). thanks!\n. what is django-autocomplete-light?\n. updated \u2013 please let me know if that works for you.\n. stable/x.x.x > release > master\n. @parsch: what do you think? IMO, we can\u00b4t support every 3rd\u2013party app (not until there\u00b4s an established Frontend\u2013Framework with consistent classes and styles with the vanilla admin theme). on the other hand, adding this one additional style is fine with me ...\n. thx. added to stable/3.4.x and fixed some missing urls.\n. @michaelmior no problem and thanks for the patch.\n. already fixed with stable/3.4.x\n. the \"releases\" section on github front (https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli) says 2.3.9 is the latest release for 2.3. \nthe latest release on pypi is 2.3.9 as well ...\nwhat do you mean with \"the Zip button to download an archive for the 2_3 branch\" ... can you give me a link/url?\n. now I see \u2013 you\u00b4re using the \"wrong\" branch. grappelli_2_3 is a dev branch, stable/2.3.x is the right one \u2013\u00a0besides, using pypi is always recommended.\n. you\u00b4re right \u2013 that should be more obvious. I\u00b4ll open a ticket.\n. done\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions. this is an issue tracker. thx.\nabout your question: it depends on what you mean with \"navigation\" ... grappelli.dashboard adds the ability to use a custom index dashboard (which needs to be defined, see the docs for that).\n. that navigation needs to be customized (we removed it with previous versions of grappelli).\n. well \u2013 I\u00b4d personally use a list (ul) and add it to the header\u2013area.\n. no, I don\u00b4t mind ... but the line you\u00b4re referring to is the same with the django admin interface. not sure what\u00b4s the problem here. do you have an idea?\n. closing this for now. please reopen with more details. thx.\n. first question: how can I reproduce this? my models are never sorted arbitrary.\nsecond: the point with a model\u2013list is to show models independent or their names. what if I want a different ordering? currently, I can order my models with giving them a different position ...\n. sorry, but I still don\u00b4t get it \u2013 can you tell me how I\u00b4m able to reproduce this issue? my models are never being sorted randomly but based on their position.\n. I mean the position within the tuple:\nmodels=('django.contrib.auth.models.User', 'django.contrib.auth.models.Group'),\ninstead of:\nmodels=('django.contrib.*',),\nIMO, that\u00b4s the point of using a modellist (otherwise, an applist is probably better).\n. is this still an issue?\n. @phretor that\u00b4s strange. I just checked again and both your examples work fine with my setup. are you sure your models are references with e.g. \"academic.publishing.ConferenceArticle\" instead of something like \"academic.publishing.models.ConferenceArticle\"? whatever reason, this should definitely work (and it always has with my projects).\n. When looking at the code at bitbucket, I think you should use academic.publishing.models.ConferenceArticle ... any reason you don\u00b4t use \"models\"?\nWhen you check admin.py, you see that the models are imported with\nfrom academic.publishing.models import *\n. @phretor yeah!\n. guess that issue is solved, right? please reopen or add a new issue if you\u00b4re still having problems with sorting models \u2013\u00a0it should work tas explained by phretor above.\n. should already be solved with stable/2.4.x ... new release on pypi coming soon.\n. already solved with stable/3.4.x ... release coming soon.\n. are you sure the styles/templates are properly loaded? because I\u00b4m not able to reproduce that screenshot with IE9 ... that\u00b4s IE8, right?\n. @lvelezsantos what \"problems mentioned above\"? kenricci (who opened the ticket) obviously solved the problem and it was some kind of setup\u2013issue (or mis\u2013installation). so, there\u00b4s nothing we can actually refer to.\n. please add a new ticket with a more detailed description if the problem still exists.\n. I\u00b4ve added your code to stable/2.4.x, though we\u00b4re now having an issue with autocomplete\u2013lookups if nothing is found. I\u00b4ll check that.\n. @BertrandBordage Sorry, I\u00b4m trying to rephrase. I need to know if any of the methods you defined is important for overriding stuff (either for you, personally, or based on your idea of how the classes should work on a purely theoretical level). Let\u00b4s take \"model_in_GET\" ... needed for a specific reason or just a personal decision? Could we distinguish between helper\u2013methods (e.g. model_in_GET) and methods which could/should be overriden (e.g. get_queryset)? IMO, something like public/private functions would help for naming the methods and clarify the behaviour. Do you know what I mean?\nBesides, FILTER and SEARCH is not being splitted with autocompletes (filter is part of get_queryset) ... any reason that filter is not a separate method?\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. @parsch can you take a look at this one?\n. supporting django-mptt is definitely planned, but I need to take a closer look at the possible issues. supporting FeinCMS is not planned though.\n. I\u00b4ve been taking a look at django\u2013mptt. Integration with Grappelli is easy (we just need to add 2 simple templates), but it\u00b4ll never look nice because of this:\nhttps://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/blob/master/mptt/templatetags/mptt_admin.py#L102\nhardcoded margin with python-code. WTF!\n. there should be a class instead of the hardcoded padding. if the guys over at django\u2013mptt will change this, integration with grappelli is easy.\n. Here\u00b4s a workaround: see https://gist.github.com/4452240\nI\u00b4m closing this ticket for now. If the guys doing django\u2013mptt will remove the paddings from python code, we\u00b4ll support mptt.\n. did you check the tinymce setup? did you add/remove valid elements to show the player?\nplease refer to the tinymce docs in order to resolve this issue. I\u00b4m pretty sure it\u00b4s not related to grappelli ... feel free to reopen this ticket (with additional information) if you think it\u00b4s a grappelli\u2013related bug.\n. change the background with css\nadd a logo with using a custom header\noverriding grappelli\u2013templates works exactly like overriding django\u2013templates (of course, it depends on the position of your template\u2013loaders).\n. which version of grappelli are you using?\n. thx, I\u00b4ll look into that.\n. Thanks \u2013 that looks good. Any reason you wanna merge to master instead of stable/2.4.x?\n. Sorry for being so skeptical, but what are all these commits? Is it possible you\u00b4re just sending your own changes? Otherwise I can still cherry\u2013pick your updates ...\n. awesome \u2013 thx a lot.\n. that\u00b4s already solved ... see stable/2.4.x\n. Thanks for the effort, but we don\u00b4t support translations with grappelli (if we do, we need to use Transifex and that\u00b4s just too much work for a couple of translatable lines). Another reason we don\u00b4t add TinyMCE language files is that we plan to use another editor as soon as possible ... sorry!\n. Where did you find translations?\nI personally would like to switch to Redactor, but the editor still produces strange HTML. I never liked CKEditor, but the current theme looks really nice. Main problem is: With every update of TinyMCE, we need to update all the plugins because of the look & feel.\n. Alright \u2013 I forgot that we have these translations. In that case, I\u00b4m going to add your translations (of course). Though it\u00b4d be helpful if you patch against stable/2.4.x (not master).\nUnfortunately, Redactor currently just looks impressive \u2013 but it behaves pretty annoying.\n. Yes. The only problem I see is when the changelist is paginated. How would you solve that? How can I move an item from page 2 to page 1?\n. IMO we should not add a feature if it doesn\u00b4t fully work. I can already hear clients calling asking how to reorder with pagination activated. However, I do like the feature and if we find a decent solution, I\u00b4m definitely +1. From my point of view, the limitation is serious since you\u00b4re not able to re\u2013position an element from one page to another ...\n. I just realized there\u00b4s a setting list_max_show_all since Django 1.4 (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_max_show_all). I guess it only makes sense to reorder a manageable amount of items. And with the given option, one could still click on \"Show All\" in order to rearrange items which haven previously been on different pages.\nTherefore, I\u00b4m accepting a patch (please use stable/2.4.x for pull\u2013requests).\nBut the behaviour needs to be similar with inlines (no extra js with ModelAdmin).\n. @brejoc Are you working on this one? Otherwise, I'm going to close the ticket.\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. closing this since no useful explanation is given.\n. this is an issue tracker ... please use the google\u2013group for asking questions. thx.\n. you\u00b4re working with django 1.6 while django 1.5 is not yet released?\n. alright, I see. is your pull\u2013request backwards\u2013compatible?\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. how is this solved with the original admin interface? do they use get_short_name?\nand: please patch against stable/2.4.x (not master).\n. Thanks for looking into that.\n. that change is not backwards\u2013compatible with 1.4 ...\n. should be solved with stable/2.4.x\n. No, there currently isn\u00b4t (though it should be a matter of minutes setting up grappelli with an existing django project). However, we might add a live demo soon.\n. we decided that this is out of scope. besides, there's no need (at least not for us) to advertise the project.\n. I see your point ... but while you don't have the time to research the benefits, we don't have the time to setup and maintain a demo site (that said, I guess researching the benefits is less time-consuming).\n. Not sure about that one since it's fairly easy to use grappelli with an existing project. So you just need to setup a project and install grappelli.\nHowever, you could use the model available with grappelli/tests in order to work on this feature. If you send a PR I'm happy to review.\n. @doganmeh a grid-based look & feel is definitely not a standard feature (django doesn't care at all about the UI).\n. shouldn\u00b4t that be:\ntry:\n    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *\nexcept ImportError:\n    from django.conf.urls import *\notherwise, it\u00b4s backwards\u2013incompatible, right? \n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. say I\u00b4m using \"name__icontains\" for my autocomplete lookups and I\u00b4m having numerous db\u2013rows with the same name ... why should I only see \"distinct\" values?\n. thx. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. Thanks for pointing this out. Mobile is definitely in discussion, though part of a bigger strategy on how we\u00b4ll develop Grappelli in the future. Currently we\u00b4re trying to fix as many limitations (caused by the original admin interface) as possible with Grappelli. However, this is tedious and time\u2013consuming.\nOur idea is to implement a frontend framework with the admin interface based on a fixed and updated foundation (talking about django.contrib.admin). Once the main issues are solved, we can get rid of all workarounds and invest more time for important issues like mobile browsers. Until then, we don\u00b4t have the ressources to do that work.\nThat being said, we do accept patches ... \n. thanks \u2013 we\u00b4ll take a look.\n. see #274\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x ... somehow it seems that GitHub doesn\u00b4t accept commits with \"fixed #xxx\" anymore.\n. that needs to be added to model_list as well, right?\n. in order to reproduce this \u2013\u00a0where do I actually add the code you\u00b4ve mentioned above? models, admin, ...?\n. just tested \u2013 IMO the trans templatetag should also be used with model.title (with app_list) and child.title (with model_list). otherwise, there\u00b4s no translation. on the other hand, I might not fully understand what you\u00b4re actually trying to translate (app title, model title, both)?\n. there\u00b4s a difference: with using the dashboard, you can easily translate the app\u2013name with the dashboard title (which is not possible when using the standard template). so I\u00b4m not sure this change has any benefits ... does it?\nbesides, when translating the app\u2013name with the dashboard template, why not also translate the model names?\n. Now I\u00b4ve got it \u2013 sorry! And thanks for the explanation.\n. @parsch fixed?\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. you\u00b4re talking about a textfield (not a foreign key), right?\nbesides \u2013 why are you using mark_safe? this could obviously break the layout depending on the content of your textfield.\n. @parsch any idea?\n. did you check stable/2.4.x ... isn\u00b4t that already solved?\nsecond question: that\u00b4s a non\u2013backwards compatible change, right? so this is related to django 1.6?\n. there should be a button \"X\" on the right\u2013hand side of each row (the checkbox is hidden). do you have the permissions to delete the items?\n. what do you mean with \"delete the row\"? what if you just made a mistake (e.g. clicking the wrong row)?\n. 1. let\u00b4s say you hide the row (but that was a mistake). what do you do? reload the page?\n2. hiding the row suggests that the record is being deleted immediately (and that you don\u00b4t need to press \"save\").\n. you\u00b4re kidding, right?\n. @parsch what do you think? I\u00b4d go with the current solution and I don\u00b4t see the need to change this.\n. closing this for now. IMO the proposed solution has no benefits.\n. please send your model (the relevant part) and the admin definition. thx.\n. There\u00b4s not attribute columns with the Dashboard (see the grappelli docs for more details). Use the attribute columns with the dashboard\u2013module.\n. since grappelli is only a skin, that\u00b4s more of a django issue, right?\n. Alright, closing this for now.\n. @parsch you might want to look at this. I personally don\u00b4t like using the resize\u2013icon for showing the pagebreak.\n. what exactly is the usecase for text\u2013align and font\u2013colors? this is better done with using classes, isn\u00b4t it? I know we could just add this ... on the other hand, I don\u00b4t think there\u00b4s a good reason these buttons should ever (ever!) be present with a text editor.\nhowever, I\u00b4m open to conviction.\n. see #214\n. thx. could you patch against stable/2.4.x or is it too complicated? otherwise I\u00b4m trying to cherry\u2013pick your changes.\n. I might be missing something, but what exactly is the \"problem\" you\u00b4ve mentioned? Using an integer field for an ID is the way to go, right? Should we change the docs?\n. @paramburu yes, you are right \u2013\u00a0we\u00b4ll take a look.\n@parsch might be easy to solve with adding input.vTextField and textarea.vLargeTextField to the fields we need to hide via css.\n. seems to work with charfields, does not work with textareas.\n. @parsch works now, but after selecting an item from a pop\u2013up the screen jumps to top ... with fk and m2m as well. this didn\u00b4t happen before.\n. works for me. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. thanks, but that\u00b4s the totally wrong branch. please user either stable/2.4.x or master.\n. fixed in stable/2.4.x\n. thx, good point. with the \"new version of Django\" you\u00b4re referring to what exactly? upcoming 1.5 or 1.6 (dev)?\n. How exactly is this related to Grappelli?\n. @Hedde it has to be the other way round \u2013\u00a0FeinCMS needs to be based on Grappelli if both apps should work nicely with each other.\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. Hard to say \u2013\u00a0I suggest using print\u2013statements with the related lookup view and/or the js, trying to find out why the app_label and model_name is missing. Looks weird and shouldn't happen.\n. just a guess \u2013 is it possible that the term \"condition\" causes the error. did you try to rename the field?\nbesides, could you send me the code to my email address (incl. models.py, admin.py)?\n. thanks for clarifying.\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. The google\u2013group ist a better place to ask questions. However, if this should happen it needs to be the other way round ... Django\u2013CMS has to be based on Grappelli, using the right classes and DOM (see Grappellis DOM docs).\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. thanks for the patch ... fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. already fixed.\n. which version of django, which version of grappelli? does it work with raw\u2013id\u2013fields?\n. ok, thanks \u2013\u00a0I'll take a look. if you have any additional info, please let me know.\n. just tested this and it works fine for me.\n. yes, just to be sure. and please add your admin config. besides, do you get any js errors?\n. did you try with grappelli 2.4.4 (the latest version)?\n. closing this since the last comment is 3 months old and additional information is missing.\n. already solved with stable/2.4.x\n. already solved with stable/2.4.x \u2013\u00a0we'll release a new version soon.\n. if we look at djangos setup.py it should be:\n'Programming Language :: Python',\n'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.6',\n'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7',\n'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.2',\n'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.3',\nright?\n. already committed. thanks for the hint.\n. please reopen with a useful description of the problem \u2013 you\u00b4re saying that \"grappelli is not compatible with django 1.5\", but that\u00b4s wrong. please add comprehensible details. thank you!\n. it seems that you didn\u00b4t follow the installation steps:\nhttps://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/2.4.4/quickstart.html\nthere\u00b4s definitely no bug here! please use the grappelli google\u2013group for asking questions ... thanks!\n. you are right \u2013\u00a0we didn\u00b4t yet find a way to translate the datepicker.\n. the django datepicker is extremely hard to style and we're using jqueryUI anway. that being said, it should (theoretically) be possible to get the defined language and change the datepickers language \u2013 it's definitely possible with using a custom base template.\nI'm sorry ... I know this is not a satisfying answer. but it's already a lot of work dealing with all the strange code of the original interface.\n. the same is true for autocomplete generic lookups when content_type is defined with radio_fields ... right?\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x (merged to master)\n. sorry, but grappelli\u2013safe is not developed or maintained by us ... I guess you need to talk to the people doing mezzanine.\n. the .editorconfig looks good to me although I'd go with spaces (instead of tabs) for scss\u2013files as well \u2014 I just did a quick check and could not find any files with tabs ...\na pull request is very much appreciated.\n. I'm sorry, but I'm not able to merge this pull\u2013request ... \n. it's a merging issue because of the updates we made recently.\n. usually it's the latest development branch we're using (e.g. stable/2.4.x), but currently you can use master since everything's merged.\n. did you send the new pull\u2013request?\n. closing this for now, since there doesn't seem to be a usable pull\u2013request. please open a new issue if you're working on this one.\n. @jaap3 thanks for the heads up. I'll take a look and let you know if it works (or not).\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions. thank you.\n. Is that also the case with Django 1.5 or only with django\u2013master (because we only support official django releases).\n. please use the google\u2013groups for asking questions. If you think this is a bug with grappelli, please reopen the ticket with a detailed explanation on what's wrong. thx.\n. @BertrandBordage it works fine with our testcases and the class should be there (see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/static/grappelli/js/jquery.grp_related_fk.js#L22). are you sure you're having the right version installed?\n. thx. I've removed the URLs and changed the hosting mode.\n. I guess there's something wrong with your setup on the position\u2013field, because I'm not able to reproduce this. can you send your models and modeladmins?\n. closing this \u2013 please reopen with detailed information if you think this is a bug.\n. good point.\n. looking at the code (at github) there does not seem to be any .DS_store files ... ???\n. so how do I remove these files then?\n. tinymce does not include that css\u2013file, so we'll remove it from the template.\n. why do you add a template to /admin/constance/ instead of /constance/ ... that looks a bit strange to me ... ???\n. I see ... not a good idea to put the templates there, but not much we can do about that I guess. will merge soon. thanks for the pull\u2013request.\n. @hellysmile just checked your template and it does not seem to follow the way grappelli templates are built ... I'm trying to fix this (but it might take a while).\n. Why don't you add related_label to the model containing the ContentType reference?\n. Your PageObject does not have a name nor an app_label, therefore\nreturn force_text(\"%s:%s\" % (self.name, self.app_label))\ndoes not return anything ... \n. Did you try to debug in order to see what exactly is happening? I assume you need to use content_object (or content, in your case), but I didn\u00b4t test that obviously.\n. There might be a misunderstanding: related_label refers to how selected items are being displayed (e.g. within an autocomplete\u2013field or a raw\u2013id\u2013field). It does not refer to the content\u2013type dropdown (changing that dropdown is not related to grappelli).\n. what exactly do you mean? activating the admin for related lookups?\n. generally speaking, we don't duplicate the django\u2013docs. this is needed for the original admin to work (not only for grappelli), so I'm not sure we should add this ... we have to assume people now how to deal with the original admin when using grappelli.\n. I see your point ... however, it's stated clearly with the docs that autocompletes are an alternative for related lookups. And you need to register both models with every kind of relationship when using django.contrib.admin.\nThat being said, I'll add a short note with the docs.\n. Did you add the module to your Dashboard?\n. yes, you should do that \u2013\u00a0it's in the docs (see grappelli.dashboard).\n. I though you closed it ... I just closed the ticket ... ???\n. I see \u2013 thanks for the pull\u2013request (reopened).\n. that's a backwards\u2013incompatible change with django 1.6, right?\n. Thanks. We won't fix this with the upcoming release (since we only support official releases of Django). However, if someone adds a backwards\u2013compatible patch, I'm fine with implementing this.\n. that should already be solved, see\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/templates/admin/edit_inline/stacked.html#L45\nIf you still see this issue, please reopen the ticket.\n. @BertrandBordage That's a good point. I personally don't see inlines \"moving\", but that's probably because my admin pages are loading pretty fast. Theoretically speaking, I like the suggested solution because we get rid of the JS. But I'm not sure about the actual implementation with something like fieldsets_and_inlines_order = ('f', 'i', 'i') ...  it's just not obvious what happens and which 'i' I'm referring to. Any ideas on how this could be improved?\n. are you interested in updating your patch in order to support a more verbose kind of rearrangement?\nI'm thinking about something like this:\n(\"Some Fieldset\", {\n    \"classes\": (\"grp-collapse grp-open\",),\n    \"fields\": (\"whatever\",)\n}),\n(\"Image Inlines\", {\"inline\": \"ImagesInline\"),\n(\"Another Fieldset\", {\n    \"classes\": (\"grp-collapse grp-open\",),\n    \"fields\": (\"whatever\",)\n}),\n. There is an example with the docs. You need a class placeholder and a 2nd class which matches the class of the inline-group (which depends on your fieldsets). If you have an inline images the class would probably be images-group.\nBesides, please use the google-group for asking questions (it\u00b4s more likely to get an answer there).. http://skin.tinymce.com\n. you need to use the grp\u2013prefix, so it's e.g. grp-collapse ... but please use the google-group for asking questions.\n. grappelli respects limit_choices_to which works fine with our testcases. if you think there's a bug, please reopen this ticket with additional details (models, ModelAdmin ... grappelli/django version etc etc). if this is a question (I'm actually not sure about it), please use the google\u2013group.\n. I'm sorry if I'm not able to follow ... so we're not talking about limit_choices_to but only queryset, right?\n. I'm +1 on fixing this \u2013 can you support an example (models.py, ModelAdmin, ...)?\n. Nope ... code snippets are fine (just to get the basic idea in order to construct a testcase). As simple as possible!\n. alright, thanks a lot. What I tried is to restrict the class RelateLookup (line 51), because this is what AutocompleteLookup relies on, but it does not seem to work. Will dig in deeper tomorrow (time to go to bed around here).\n. I'm actually not sure how to solve this. Theoretically speaking, we need to check for a method queryset, defined with ModelAdmin. Therefore, we have to find the registered ModelAdmin first ... and in order to get the ModelAdmin, we need to know which AdminSite we're currently using (because we cannot assume the model is registered with django.contrib.admin).\n1. Find current AdminSite\n2. check _registry for the model\n3. This gives us the correct ModelAdmin\n4. check if queryset is defined (if not, use the default manager)\nAny help is appreciated.\n. This should work ... the only issue left is figuring out the current AdminSite ...\ntry:\n    # See if there is a custom admin queryset\n    return admin_site._registry[self.model].queryset(self.request)\nexcept:\n    # If not, go with the default manager\n    return self.model._default_manager.all()\n. @rcooke with my testcase, if I'm using model.queryset(request) it does not work ... because model has no idea about ModelAdmin (but the custom queryset is defined with ModelAdmin). Besides, ModelAdmin is registered with a specific admin site (not necessarily django.contrib.admin) and that's why I try to get the current admin site. Are your sure that model.queryset(request works with your setup? I'm really surprised about that ...\n. IMO, we cannot assume people use the default admin site. I think the only way to find out which is the current admin site is via URLs ... and it shouldn't matter if a model is registered with several sites (because each ModelAdmin could have a different custom queryset). From my point of view, the second problem is exactly the same as the first one. Once we have the current admin site, we also have the right queryset.\n. That's what I'm talking about ... we need to check the URL (request.path) and the admin site associated with that specific URL (no GET parameters involved here). Unfortunately, with current_app (see django.contrib.admin), we only get the name of the admin site.\n. Question is, how do we get this list of admin sites ... because I didn't find a way except manually adding a list of admin sites to settings (which is not a good solution).\n. @rcooke are you still working on this issue?\n. see #403 \n. @rockymeza sorry ... thought this is backwards\u2013incompatible.\n. Sorry, but I'm not able to follow that pull request. Your 2nd paragraph says \"The \"<\" character shouldn't ever be in the label\" ... to me, that sounds like you're seeing an \"<\" character, but it doesn't show up on your screenshots. Am I missing something?\n. now I see \u2013 thanks for the clarification. I'll update later today.\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions. this is an issue tracker! thanks.\n. my thoughts on the mentioned ideas:\n- replacing icons with a decent webfont is a good idea\n- concerning the dashboard: we'll probably change the header\u2013area a bit with the next major release of grappelli. so your dashboard screenshot is something we currently cannot consider.\n- notifications etc: see previous. we should add the styles for adding this, but we definitely won't add the actual implementation.\n- sidebar: the alternate sidebar should already be possible with the current grappelli\u2013styles.\n- changelist: not sure what this screenshot should tell us \u2013 looks like a standard changelist to me.\n- +1 for adding tabs.\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions! this is an ISSUE TRACKER!!!\n. please check the contribution guidelines and reopen the issue \u2013\u00a0thanks.\n. thanks for the patch \u2013\u00a0looks good to me. can you add another usecase besides the one mentioned? because I'm not sure if we should add this if it only covers this (very rare) case.\n. alright \u2013\u00a0I'm currently +1, but let me think about this for another day ;-)\n. let's do this. a pull\u2013request is highly appreciated (including documentation updates).\n. @arski There's gonna be another grappelli\u2013release pretty soon (just some minor fixes). If you send a pull\u2013request, I'll add it to the release.\n. thanks for the patch. IMO this should be done with overriding the template (see django\u2013docs on how to customize admin templates), because we just can't support every single usecase and overriding templates is an easy and straightforward solution. \n. any idea on how to make that update backwards compatible?\n. that\u00b4s fine, thanks.\n. smart_bytes is not available with django1.4\n. That was just a reminder for myself to update the grappelli docs, saying that at least django 1.4.2 is required. Since we have supported Django 1.4+ so far, I need to mention that. But of course you are right that 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 should not be used anymore.\n. @parsch clicking on a datepicker throws a 404:\n\"NetworkError: 404 NOT FOUND - .../static/grappelli/jquery/ui/css/custom-theme/images/ui-bg_glass_0_CEE9F2_1x400.png\"\n. Thx for the pull\u2013request. When using this code I'm getting Invalid filter: 'admin_urlquote' ... which version of django did you use?\n. see #395\n. that has already been solved with 2.4.7.\nbesides, your pull\u2013request misses the stacked inlines.\nplease reopen this ticket if I'm wrong ...\n. did you test without grappelli? because that js comes with django. \n. hi bryan,\nunfortunately, that image you posted is not visible \u2013 I'm getting a 404.\nregards,\npatrick\n. that\u00b4s strange. just a guess: if you add an app with INSTALLED_APPS, did you add exactly the same path with your dashboard and your admin registration? e.g., you could have www.blog with INSTALLED_APPS and you could just add blog when you register your admin model and you could again add www.blog with the dashboard ... that might not work.\n. you do have the necessary permissions for music, right?\nyou could try this (just to see if it is working):\nmodels=('components.merchandise.music.models.XXX',),\nother than that, I really don't have an idea \u2013\u00a0I usually use the exact same code. of course, you could try to debug with dashboard.modules.AppList (a simple print statement should be sufficient).\n. @bryanveloso ok, so I did a couple of tests with either AppList and ModelList \u2014 it doesn't matter if I use several single models or if I use components.merchandise.* or components.merchandise.music.*, it all works. the only issue I had is when the app added with dashboard is named differently than with INSTALLED_APP \u2014 other than that I haven't been able to reproduce this.\n. closing this for now \u2013 if you think this is a bug, please reopen with additional information.\n. Thanks for the pull\u2013request.\nI'm having a couple of issues here:\n1) If I add an Inline and then drag it to another position, TinyMCE seems to react strange (I'm not able to insert text anymore).\n2) When having an Inline with just a textarea and a position\u2013field, the position is not being updated, because line 245 of stacked.html (var fields=...) does not include TinyMCE.\nAny ideas how to solve this?\n. closing this since the PR is pretty old ... please add a new PR if you still work on this issue.\n. closing this, because the authority templates are quite a mess.\n. of course, using sessions does not work \u2013 instead we use the cache framework. because the key has to be the path to the current site, this is limited to showing one additional user, but I guess that's fine for now. seeing another user viewing/editing the site should be enough of a warning. we just want to make sure an editor knows about another editor currently online.\n. https://github.com/django/django/commit/389892aae595b86c4be28c43e3312d76a68a0173\n. @bryanveloso I've added a quick fix. But please note that grappelli is not yet compatible with Django 1.6 \u2014 there's a lot of backwards-incompatible changes (esp. with admin templates). Therefore, we need to do a new major release. Quickly looking through all the necessary changes, I doubt that this will happen within the next couple of weeks. \n. @bryanveloso yes \u2026 there's only two things you need to check: a) the new approach for defining \"view on site\" doesn't work with the current version of grappelli and b) preserve_filters doesn't work as well.\n. fixed with master\n. see #396 \n. @parsch please take a look at this one (needs to be styled).\n. @brenouchoa absolutely. coming today!\n. @dmrz thanks a lot for the pull\u2013request, but please use branch stable/2.5.x for everything related to Django 1.6.\n. @lzanuz thanks!\n. @lzanuz and \u2026 thanks again!\n. @lzanuz thanks \u2026 the template changes are already solved (see branch stable/2.5.x). concerning the widgets, I've opened a separate ticket.\n. all 1.6 compatibility issues should now be solved with branch stable/2.5.x (pypi release coming later today)\n. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/widgets/#numberinput\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/widgets/#emailinput\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/widgets/#urlinput\n. @parsch moreover, with a changelist and list\u2013editables, the URLField is wrapped with p.url which adds margins at the top/bottom (these margins/paddings need to be removed).\n. @pnovotnak because you mentioned mezzanine: please note that mezzanine relies on a pretty outdated version of grappelli and they are using a separate branch.\n. @tdruez there is no help_text with the django templates, is there?\n. I see \u2013 thanks for the clarification.\n. @rcooke filters are not handled by grappelli, but by django. we don't customise anything here.\n. @pauloxnet did you do any tests? does it work? can you add a testcase?\n. @pauloxnet I'm sorry, but I won't merge this without tests ... but thanks for the patch anyway.\n. how does that test relate to your pull-request? I think we need a modeladmin with a custom queryset, don't we? In my opinion, there needs to be a new (or at least extended) testcase.\nbesides, your pull-reqeust does not work if models are registered with several admin sites, does it? when you take a look at my first comment, you'll see that my proposal includes adding the model_admin to the ajax-call. that's because (in my opinion) we cannot rely on registry to provide us with the correct modeladmin.\n. a) yes, modeladmin has get_queryset but we don't have testcases for that option. that's exactly what I'm talking about ... we need tests to cover that option. of course, these tests are currently not necessary since we don't support custom querysets (but a pull-request should include the tests).\nb) just by looking at the code, I think your pull-request does not work with several admin sites ... but I'm not sure since we don't have a testcase.\n. see https://gist.github.com/sehmaschine/41747752e56e2723368a409feb3cbd5c\nthe changes are in lines 21, 76-81 and 96-98.\nIt\u00b4s actually a pretty easy workaround, but (in my opinion) it does not work with multiple/custom admin sites since we only check the contrib.admin registry. I'm not sure how we could solve this and I'm currently unable to add a testcase. As said before, if someone comes up with a working and tested solution, I'm more than happy to merge it.\n. sorry, but I'm not able to follow \u2026 what exactly is the bug/issue?\n. should it? if yes, why?\nI still don't see what the bug/issue is \u2026 is this limited to your personal/custom usecase or valid for anybody?\n. let me put it this way: why do you use an onclick attribute anyway? isn't it better to use something like .bind(\"click\", \u2026).\n. hmm, alright \u2013 since it won't break anything I'll update. thanks for reporting.\n. grappelli 2.4.8 (compatible with django 1.5) does not include firstof from future, grappelli 2.5.0 (compatible with django 1.6) does.\n. that\u00b4s another issue now, right? could you please open a new ticket?\nthe README doesn\u00b4t need to be updated since grappelli 2.4.8 is supposed to work with django 1.4 and 1.5.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue. {% now \"Z\" %} should work with django 1.4/1.5 and 1.6, although django only uses it with the admin interface from 1.7 \u2026 however, this should not throw an error.\nare you able to add any details?\n. @foxx alright, thanks for clarifying.\n. sorry, but I'm not able to follow \u2026 what exactly is the bug?\nwe have recently updated jquery/jquery-ui but decided to keep the old files (js, css) because people might have used these files for customizations.\n. now I see \u2013 thanks for clarifying. that's a bug indeed.\n. what exactly is the \"improvement\"?\nI didn't check order_with_respect_to for quite a while, but it has been there from the very beginning \u2013 but it actually never worked correctly (or at least the way it's supposed to work). Besides, you can just use \"_order\" as your sortable_field \u2026 so I'm not sure what exactly we should change with grappelli.\nI'm closing this because of the missing details. That being said, it might still be a good idea \u2013 but maybe I'm just not understanding it right now. So please feel free to reopen this ticket with additional explanations.\n. what do you mean with \"under the search button\"?\n. same problem as #411 \n. @lzanuz From my point of view, what you\u00b4re saying is only true when applying more than one filter. With a single filter applied, the current version is faster (because you only need one click instead of an additional submit-button). Therefore, I'm not sure if your suggestion improves the overall usability. \n. it seems that you don't have a request defined with your context \u2026 is that possible? can you try to debug and check why line 219 with grp_tags throws an error?\n. and \u2026 did you run the tests?\n. can you check why there's no request\u2013var?\n. just to get this right \u2014 everything besides SWITCH_USER does work, right?\n. please add an example (code!) to your proposal. thanks.\n. it should be possible to overwrite the jQuery function (I guess). and I think that\u00b4s a much better solution, because we can't add blocks to everything. IMO that usecase is too personal to change the code \u2026 but I might rethink the issue if overwriting the js\u2013functions doesn\u00b4t work.\n. what you're experiencing here is exactly what @parsch described \u2026 it does not make sense to add the block to every stacked inline. therefore, we decided to not implement this. if you find another solution which works for single inlines, please feel free to reopen this ticket.\n. the policy depends on the version of the docs \u2013 with a new version (e.g. 2.5.x) previous updates are only mentioned with the major version. as far as I know, that's how Django does it as well \u2026 if I'm wrong, please feel free to reopen this ticket.\n. there have been changes with jquery handling _renderItem \u2026 maybe we've missed something, but it works with my testcases (multiple autocompletes as well). \nyou might wanna try this one:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9513251/cannot-set-property-renderitem-of-undefined-jquery-ui-autocomplete-with-html\nwhen looking on our code (e.g. jquery.grp_autocomplete_fk.js, line 114) it looks strange indeed. we first use .data(\"ui-autocomplete\") and later on .data( \"item.autocomplete\", item ) ...\n. did you check all staticfiles are loaded correctly (eg the new versions of jquery & jqueryui)? \n. Please use the Google\u2013Group for asking questions. If you think this is a bug, please add specific details. Thank you!\n. +1 if this is a replacement (or add-on) for drag/drop. If one needs to resort with manually editing positions, every number (position) should be possible (not only negative numbers). On the other hand, it might be confusing when an item jumps to another position.\nI have the feeling that this usecase is better solved with a custom js (or maybe with overriding the models save-method and rearranging the items).\nFeel free to reopen the ticket ...\n. Can't open the screenshot \u2026 is it the same as #405 \u2026 ?\nBesides, you did not mention which version of Grappelli you're using.\n. Alright, so that's actually solved already.\n. yes, it's marked as closed with a commit \u2026 isn't it solved?\n. I see \u2014 2.5.1 will probably be released early next week.\n. that\u00b4s already solved with stable/2.5.x\n. you only fix line 135 with your patch \u2014 but you're suggesting to fix line 63 as well, right?\n. we decided to delete the outdated jquery files instead of adding the images. thanks for the patch.\n. which version of django & grappelli?\n. that should be solved with branch stable 2.5.x \u2026 any chance you can give that a try?\n. sorry, you are right \u2013 this issue is not yet solved!\n. that\u00b4s not a grappelli issue: seems that your staticfiles are not loaded correctly (or maybe collectstatic didn\u00b4t work as expected). I'm pretty sure this is similar to #214 \u2026 if I missed something, please reopen this ticket with additional information (js-errors, debug statemenets etc.).\n. do you use grappelli.dashboard or not?\n. that\u00b4s two different issues in my opinion: we could update index.html in order to work with adminplus (a patch would be nice).\non the other hand, I'm not sure we should add adminplus with grappelli.dashboard \u2013 because you can easily add links (or even custom views) with a dashboard. so that doesn't make sense from my point of view \u2026\nbefore we change the code someone should test with and without the dashboard.\n. the whole point of the custom dashboard is to not show anything automatically.\n. absolutely: can you test adding adminplus to the dashboard?\n. I mean adding the custom views to a custom dashboard (with grappelli.dashboard) \u2014 what you proposed before with \"semi-automatically\".\n. there\u00b4s no sidebar block, but that\u00b4s not the point IMO. why do you believe code changes are necessary? context should include the custom list and you should be able to loop the items \u2026 well, you might need to dive into dashboards a bit.\n. I'm pretty sure any app using a custom index page will fail with grappelli, because our template structure differs \u2026 no matter if we add a sidebar block or not.\n. Your patch is fine, because you are using the grp-classes (e.g. grp-module).\nIf we just add a sidebar-block and another 3rd-party app extends that block without the grp-classes, there's no compatibility in the first place. That being said, I'm ok with adding that block \u2013 because most of the time, people probably use the custom dashboard anyway.\n. that template you mention hopefully doesn't work with grappelli \u2014 inline-styles, tables \u2026 wow!!!\n. the patch should work \u2013 I'll check that (probably next week).\n. you mean using Bootstrap instead of a custom theme?\n. we won\u00b4t using bootstrap for a couple of reasons (we discussed that already \u2013 see issues and google-group for details).\n. that\u00b4s because django-import-export uses another dom-structure for their templates. you need to overwrite their template with grappellis dom.\n. Please take a look at the django docs \u2013 there it\u00b4s explained how to overwrite templates.\n. thx \u2013 looks good to me.\n. @funkybob just a thought: isn't it better to use the ModelAdmins get_queryset method instead of providing a specific model manager?\n. see #403 \u2026 we need to add the modeladmin to the lookup call.\n. @rcooke did you take a look at the code with issue #403?\n. closing this in favour of #403 \n. sorry, but I do not understand this issue \u2026 why would wou want to hide the related lookup when you just defined it with your modeladmin?\n. I'm closing this since it does not seem to be an \"issue\" (please use the google group for asking questions). Feel free to reopen the ticket if I missed something.\n. good point. except keyerror should be nested (I don\u00b4t like the nesting as well, but it works).\nconsidering the queryset: what if we return qs = model.objects.none() if no search_fields are defined? of course, this leads to \"0 results\" with the autocomplete instead of an error message. but from my point of view, that\u00b4s ok. what do you think?\n. @titovanton-com what exactly is the issue here? you don\u00b4t need to set extra to zero in order to work with sortable inlines \u2026 that\u00b4s definitely working. please add more details if you think it\u00b4s a bug.\n. ok \u2013 so there are 2 issues: first, please open a new ticket for change list sortables. second, please add details about the actual bug you\u00b4re talking about \u2013 what you\u00b4re saying is currently not reproducable. I'm closing this for now since there are mixed issues here.\nbesides, please take a look at the contribution guidelines. thanks!\n. instead of changing the management command, I decided to add a note to the docs \u2026 since the location depends on where manage.py is being stored (related to your project directory).\n. @pauloxnet what exactly do you mean with filter/exclude? is this related to #403?\n. I see. that\u00b4s exactly #403, right? because this behaviour should also apply to related lookups (using the search icon, for example).\n. I'm closing this in favour of #403. If you think it\u00b4s a different issue, please reopen this ticket with an additional explanation.\n. you need to define autocomplets with your ModelAdmin, see http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#autocomplete-lookups\nbesides, please use the google group for asking questions \u2026 this is an issue tracker.\n. it does work with the changelist \u2026 did you try?\n. please resend the code in a readable format.\n. uncomment list_editable \u2014 because you want to edit the field, right?\n. yes, it is a requirement \u2026\nyou did not overwrite anything (css, templates)?\ncan you send a screenshot of your changelist?\nany js errors?\n. jquery.min.map is not part of grappelli \u2026 the question is: why is this file being loaded with your setup?\n. Sorry \u2013 I don\u00b4t have time to offer that kind of support. Please try to find out what\u00b4s the issue \u2026 autocompletes are definitely working on the changelist (I just douple-checked with different browsers).\nI'm closing this ticket for now. If you find something, feel free to reopen.\n. I don\u00b4t think the python-package is an issue (I might be wrong though).\nWhat I would do:\n1. check if raw_id_fields are working with your changelist (that\u00b4s pure django, not related to grappelli).\n2. check if related-lookups (grappelli) are working.\nI would use Firefox or Safari for testing. And always check for js-errors.\n. seems to be a django issue, right? how is this related to grappelli?\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions (see contribution guidelines). thank you!\n. I'm not able to reproduce this \u2013 please add the necessary details (see contribution guidelines).\n. @gone https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst\nan example app probably won\u00b4t help, since this \"issue\" does not exist (I\u00b4m pretty sure about that). so, the question is: why does it exist with your setup? I guess that the grappelli staticfiles are not served correctly.\n. @gone the behaviour with grappelli isn\u00b4t any different from the django admin, right? does it make sense to update the docs if there\u00b4s already an explanation with the django docs?\n. @jschneier no timeline. if you wanna submit a patch, I'll merge it asap.\n. I'm still not able to reproduce this, so I'm closing this issue. Please reopen with additional details about TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID. According to the django docs, you should not assume the admin templates to be rendered correctly, if TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID is set to anything other than an empty string.\n. what I don\u00b4t get \u2026 you define 'fk': [['enterprise']],, but enterprise is not within list_display \u2026 am I missing something?\n. @ingodjango can you do me a favour and try to replace that line with\n.find(\"input[name^='\" + prefix + \"'][name$='-\" + this + \"']\")\nthere\u00b4s now an additional \"-\" with checking the name attribute.\nplease let me know if that works.\n. Thanks \u2013 I\u00b4ll change that and commit asap.\n. solved with branch stable/2.5.x \u2013 new release soon.\n. thanks for the patch. how can I reproduce this bug?\n. I'm not able to reproduce the bug ... every add-url ends with a slash and my autocomplete work fine with add pages \u2026 ???\n. @deleted the js you mentioned resolves the href-attribute given with a relation (it\u00b4s not resolving the URL). And I\u00b4m not able to find a link with an additional \"add\" ... how did you get that?\n. @deleted autocomplete uses the links given with a relation-field (fk, m2m, ...) \u2013 you should see these links with the source-code. in my opinion, a relation-field always uses /appname/modelname/ and never ends with an /add/. the question remains: how can I reproduce this?\n. alright \u2013 I'm closing this for now. please reopen with details on how to reproduce this issue \u2013 no github repo needed, just simple infos like \"go to an add view\", \"use fk-autocomplete\" etc.\n. that's a good idea \u2013 thanks for the patch.\n. @blueyed is there an issue with the original template/styles or is it just with your custom template/styles?\n. fixed with stable/2.5.x\n. @MDamien no \u2013 master does not support 1.7 (if it works with 1.7, that\u00b4s not intended). if you need a branch in order to sumit patches for 1.7, please let me know.\n. @blueyed are these changes backwards-compatible?\n. @blueyed the branch is dev/2.6.x ... I don't think it makes sense to jump from 2.5 to 2.7 just because of the django version.\n. @HiddenFox grappelli 2.5.7 is NOT compatible with django 1.8.\n. @HiddenFox come on ... https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli#releases\n. it doesn\u00b4t make sense to patch against master, if it\u00b4s a backwards-incompatible change. this is only related to django 1.7, right?\n. @blueyed You're right \u2013 I assumed you wanna merge this right now.\n. master is always targeting the latest stable release (see docs). there are actually 2 stable branches for different django-versions \u2013 IMO, it\u00b4s hard to follow another one (and just too much effort for us).\nbesides, merging is always the better option ... but that probably requires another patch once we target django 1.7.\nthe plan is to release another version with bugfixes and then start working on 1.7 (in about 3-4 weeks hopefully).\n. @blueyed I'm not able to reproduce this error ... \n. @blueyed urls are being loaded. but I don\u00b4t understand how your next 2 questions are related to the topic ... in other words: what do I need to do in order to reproduce this error? do I need to use a custom user model?\n. still not able to reproduce this!\n. closing this since I've never been able to reproduce it ... please reopen with additional details if this error still exists.\n. I can't imagine a single request, but I'm open for ideas/patches. Besides, I only see one performance issue with what you describing (instead of two).\n. closing this since there's not been a pull-request so far\n. 1 \u2013 that's already the case: select via keyboard, enter does not submit the form.\n2 \u2013 you are talking about M2M-autocompletes, right?\n3 \u2013 again, this is only about M2M-autocompletes, right?\n. 2 & 3: I guess it\u00b4s a thin line between a visually minimal and clear interface and showing every option available. I tend to agree with your proposal ... on the other hand, we don\u00b4t wanna have a cluttered interface (thinking about a distinctive block for each item with an additional X is overdone IMO). But I see your point and we\u00b4ll discuss that.\n@parsch what\u00b4s your opinion?\n. you assume that the model is registered with admin.site ... but that's not necessarily true if we use a custom admin site ... right? so your patch only works with non custom sites, or do I miss something?\n. closing this since the PR is very old ... if you still work on this issue and have a good solution, please send a new PR.\n. what version of django/grappelli are you using? did you run the tests?\nbtw: I just tested this and it works fine for me. when looking at the code in grappelli.js, I don't see any potential bugs ... can you please add some details?\n. well ... as stated with the docs, autocomplete-fields need to be raw-id-fields ... ???\n. why do you think its insecure? the admin is only used by \"trusted editors\" anyway ... so having access to the admin itself is a much higher risk than adding the model structure, don't you agree?\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions ;-)\n. I don't agree that this is a security risk ... that being said, it's always better to limit the exposed information. So if you (or someone else) comes up with a patch, I'm happy to review that.\n. which section are you talking about? do you mean the page \"home\" when logging in at djangosuit/admin/?\n. besides \u2013 questions should usually be posted to the google-group, not the issue-tracker. that way, chances are much higher that other people read it and you might get an answer.\n. when is self.model = None? second, shouldn\u00b4t this exception be handled better than just using \"except\"?\n. thanks for the patch. the problem is that you are using styles which are not designed to fit your purpose (the success and error classes are for messages, not modules). besides, I'm not sure if this is better done with a custom view instead of a dashboard module (because the usecase is very rare in my opinion).\n. closing this for now since no further comment has been posted.\n. because your commit targets master and I'm working with the stable/... branches. not sure if it's possible to cherry-pick from another branch (I never did that).\n. ok \u2013 thanks for the hint (hub looks good).\n. you say that the form does not validate ... what exactly is the error you get? I'm ignoring the issue with prepoulated fields for now since that\u00b4s a different one (which we should take care of once the initial issue is solved).\n. wait ... just a guess: try to remove the default value for your ordering field or use sortable_exluces (see http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#sortable-excludes).\n. the sortable_exludes should refer to the position-field (not title or slug) \u2013 you want to exclude the field which has a value/default.\nsecond, are you sure you removed the default value (from the database)?\nif you have 3 fields within an extra-row and one field has a value (e.g. a default value), then we assume that this row needs to be saved (hence the error messages). if the row does not have any values, there won't be an error message. you could try check the js (adding some console logs) in order to exactly figure out what\u00b4s happening.\nplease post any (javascript) errors you find so we can reproduce this \u2013 because currently it's not reproducible and I'm pretty sure it is not a bug.\n. sortable_excludes is exactly what you described: combining default values with extra rows. because the js which defines the ordering field looks if there are values within each row \u2013 if so, a number is assigned. the fields within sortable_excludes are excluded from this calculation (you usually want to exclude all fields with default values).\nunfortunately, there is currently no other way since django doesn't tell us anything about the field values (e.g. giving us a json for each row).\nif that works, do you mind opening another ticket for the issue with the slug-field not being populated?\n. alright \u2013 I'm closing this for now. please reopen if the issue still exists with sortable_excludes.\n. which css-classes did you use for the collapsibles? besides, collapsibles also work with TabularInline (just the header, of course).\n. Not exactly ... the docs first mentions InlineModelAdmin (which includes both Stacked- and TabularInline). Additionaly, you have the inline_classes with StackedInline. The docs are fine from my point of view.\nWith the actual implementation, you need to use a tuple (or list), not a string. Second, inline_classes are only available with StackedInline (because there are no collapsible headers with Tabulars, so there's nothing which could actually be collapsed).\nWith Tabulars, you only need classes. I don't see a bug here \u2013 if you find one, please check the js for any errors and post it here.\n. I see your point concerning the documentation and we'll add additional examples for collapsible inline groups.\n. there are autocompletes with grappelli (see docs).\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions (this is an issue tracker).\n. thanks for the hint ... grappelli-filters looks useful indeed.\n. fixed with 300927fd7a207e556be87fa74125f48e02716570\n. please use the google-group for asking questions \u2013 if you think this is a bug, please add useful information in order to reproduce it. thank you!\n. fixed with dev/2.6.x\n. I see your point \u2013 on the other hand, these apps do add elements to the DOM which are not compatible with grappelli anway (e.g. admin-enhancers related links which are hardcoded images with a fixed width/height). So we solve one problem in order to face another one? Not sure about that ...\n. Agreed. We'll check if it's possible to add the original classnames as well (I'm pretty sure it is).\n. @blueyed is it only .form-row and #container we need?\n. @parsch what do you think about this issue? should we use the original ids/classnames as well? probably a good idea for compatibility reasons with other packages. on the other hand, if those packages rely on the original ids/classnames, they are probably not compatible with grappelli anyway. that said, blueyed mentioned that a non-optimal solution is better than none. I'd say it depends on a) how much work it is (maintenance included) and b) if it's going to be messy with all these different ids/classnames in the end.\n. We could also state that we do not add original classnames and any 3rd-party apps which target grappelli have to use our classes instead. That's (at least) a clear distinction (though I can see the drawbacks).\n. The Mixin is a good idea \u2013 will do some tests.\n. we still need to check this last commit because of hiding the row with stacked inlines \u2013 that's a bit complicated since django doesn't provide the information with the fieldline.\n. see fe0acf4db425a25264474ea8134661705c795f2e\n. did you try with a current checkout of dev/2.6.x?\n. will take a look at your approach. besides, master is not compatible with 1.7!\n. @adaptivdesign do you use the most recent version (there have been some commits yesterday).\n. I think using _to_field is the better approach, so I'll go with that one. thanks for looking into that!\n. fixed with f6f146ee51aa89f5e68179ab43588cba78de425c\n. I can see the function with grappelli.min.js ... ???\n. ah, thanks for clarifying. fixed with 6f58813fadac98720da96e3f63851d9ee987fe2a\n. should be solved with dev/2.6.x (not sure why you tried to merge with master). please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. thanks for the patch. one important issue with inlines is that the ordering is preserved in case of errors somewhere within the form (not necessarily with the inlines). did you check that with your patch? just by looking at the code, I don't think this will work.\n. closing this because no answer has been given.\n. For how, I'm not able to reproduce this. Reopen the ticket with additional details (if this is a bug indeed).\n. see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/docs/contributing.rst ... is that ok?\n. not a bad idea. the first contributing-file is automatically shown with github when adding an issue \u2013 the second one is part of the documentation. maybe we should integrate the whole \"how to add a ticket section\" with the docs and just link from the github-contrib-file to the documentation.\n. @SalahAdDin exactly like the original admin interface (we don't change anything about popups).\n. @SalahAdDin a) check the django code b) use the django google-group c) use the grappelli google-group. this is an issue tracker!\n. the branch which includes compatibility with django 1.7 is dev/2.6.x \u2013 can you try again with that one please?\n. this might be a stupid question, but did you test that? because I don't think that the grappelli settings are available as variables within a template.\n. Closing this as wontfix \u2013 if anyone uses django-smuggler, please add a pull-request.\n. yes\n. did you check that with our 1.7 compatible branch (dev/2.6.x)?\n. I'm not sure what you mean, but it's the same with djangos admin templates:\nhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/base_site.html\nPlease reopen with additional details, if you think this is a bug ... I currently don't see why it should be one.\n. @LegoStormtroopr you are right \u2013 thanks for checking that. @parsch can you take a look at that?\n. ... which versions (django/grappelli)? any custom js/templates?\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst\n. @dlcerva @volksman did you register the related object with the same admin-site? I'm not able to reproduce this (I only get a 404 if the related model is not registered).\n. maybe this is a django bug? https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23431\n. I'm not exactly sure why the \"_to_field\" is there in the first place, but it's used with the django admin as well (of course, there's no autocompletes). We could just remove it from the lookup query, but I don't know if that might lead to other issues.\n. @volksman thanks. I've used your patch (I didn't update related.py since one might have _to_field with custom templates) and minified the js. should be solved (hopefully).\n. we did not, since the issue has been closed ... the problem with the original ticket is that the versions don't match (grappelli 2.6.x is not compatible with django 1.6).\n. @soujiro86 IMO that's overdone. if we add the requirements to the setup-file, django is being updated if you install the wrong grappelli version. I think that the requirements are thoroughly listed in different places and it's fairly easy to update django yourself. any objections?\n. should already be fixed with the master branch. can you give that a try?\n. there is a binding for django.jQuery, see\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/static/grappelli/js/grappelli.js#L12\n. not sure if this is still an issue since no further comments have been made ... please reopen with additional details if you think this is a bug.\n. I see your point ... but why do you want to install grappelli.dashboard as well as admin_tools.dashboard?\n. updated with master (I hope that fix works).\n. fixed\n. sorry, but I don't understand what this is about. \n. looks good \u2013 I'll do some tests and merge this asap. thanks for the patch!\n. @mpasternak some issues here:\na) LANGUAGE_CODE is always set, isn't it? so the \"if LANGUAGE_CODE\" doesn't really make sense in my opinion.\nb) the default value for LANGUAGE_CODE is \"en-us\", but there's not datepicker language file with that ending. we'll always get a 404 with that one.\nc) if USE_I18N is False, the admin is not being translated. so we should check that setting as well, right?\n. sorry \u2013 just to get the idea right: you are not translating the datepicker with \"en-us\", but you try to translate the datepicker with every other language. did you check the compatibility between the django language codes and the datepicker files for other languages?\n. @mpasternak I've given this another try, but ... when you look at the django example with \"de_AT\" which is represented as \"de-at\" with the frontend, no such datepicker file exists which leads to a 404. Besides, the same is true with \"pt_BR\" (because the jquery UI file contains uppercase characters).\n. I prefer to have the locale files with grappelli \u2013 but only if we don't need to rename the files (because renaming makes every jQuery update more difficult than necessary).\n. I'm with @camilonova here, because there doesn't seem to be a clean solution. Stay with en and let people take care about translations (it's pretty easy anyway).\n. Closing this issue. please refer to #577 for the 500 ... other than that, we decided to not include the translation files because of the issues mentioned before. thanks everyone for participating and thanks for the thoughts/patches. I'm sorry that we are not able to include this ... but there doesn't seem to be a straightforward and maintainable solution.\n. no, it does not explain itself. first, please add versions (see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst). second, which content is not being loaded and why? are you sure this is a grappelli-issue?\n. did you try to navigate to a static-file directly (e.g. with adding the path to the browsers address bar)? if that doesn't work, it is not related to grappelli.\n. closing this since no further details are given. not a grappelli related issue in my opinion.\n. solved with stable/2.5.x\n. No\n. @volksman @funkybob yes, it should be the other way round in order to allow overriding the static files. I  can't remember why that's in the docs, so I'm going to remove it.\n. are you sure that the app-loading mechanism with haystack is fine?\nthe lookup error is correct in that it says \"grappelli doesn't have a dashboard model\", because it's actually the app \"grappelli.dashboard\" which has the model.\ncan you debug a bit more and try to find out what causes that error?\n. line 41 of haystack breaks with grappelli:\nhttps://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack/blob/master/haystack/utils/app_loading.py#L41\nI'm not sure why they are trying to call get_model here, but I guess that's a bug with haystack. If I'm not mistaken, haystack assumes that every installed app has a model, but that's not necessarily the case.\n. I suggest talking to the people doing haystack, because that problem might occur with other apps as well.\n. Closing this for now. Please note that we'll remove TinyMCE with the next major release.\n. you could add a custom js (overwrite the template). other than that, I don't see a solution. besides, I'm pretty sure that there are more issues when it comes to using grappelli with FeinCMS.\n. I would like to see that as well, but it's too much effort in my opinion.\n. that is a useful patch indeed. thanks!\n. @gkuhn1 one question: shouldn't change be triggered with M2Ms in case of removing values as well?\n. @epicserve just tested with a fresh setup (django 1.7, grappelli 2.6.3) and I'm not able to reproduce this. all autocompletes (fk, m2m, generic) look fine.\n. the length doesn't matter with my testcase. what browser are you using?\n. we're not on yosemite yet. can you do me a favour and just try with another browser (cause it might be an issue with chrome) and tell me if that works or not.\n. @epicserve are you sure your setup is correct? I could reproduce your error with defining an m2m-field with both related_lookups and autocomplete_lookups. But it doesn't seem to be a bug with grappelli. The placeholder is only used with related lookups (but not with autocompletes).\n. sure. check the django documentation on this:\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.extra\n. The \"easiest\" way to achieve this is probably to overwrite the js (/admin/actions.js). Other than that, I don't really see a way to handle this.\n. @parsch what do you think?\n. did you add the grappelli urls?\n. since you get this error it's probably much easier for you to track a possible bug ... could you try to debug that issue?\n. @eandersons thanks for looking into that \u2013 I think I've found a solution.\n. @camilonova will be part of the next pypi release. thank you for the patch.\n. @camilonova within the next two weeks.\n. sorry ... lots of other stuff to do. Hope I'll find the time to add that update soon.\n. can't think of a way to achieve this (seems quite complicated, esp. with inlines).\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions.\n. grappelli 2.6 is not compatible with django 1.6.\nas far as I know, nested inlines are currently not possible with django \u2013 and it's not related to grappelli.\n. usually, you do not copy the folder at all but install with pip instead (so grappelli is part of your virtual envinronment and not your project).\nother than that, grappelli is an ordinary django app \u2013 so please refer to the django docs on how to install applications.\n. grappelli has to be before django.contrib.admin with INSTALLED_APPS. besides, please use the google-group for asking questions (this is an issue tracker).\n. how should we be able to reproduce this? grappelli version? django version? model? model-admin? any js errors?\nplease re-open with all necessary details.\n. sorry, we decided to not include translation files for jQuery UI (we'll remove existing files as well).\n. already solved, see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/commit/7e0847ad6093daa6f9d96bc653af60f8948121cd\n. just tested \u2013 works fine with my setup. you need to add django.contrib.admindocs to your INSTALLED_APPS after grappelli.\nIf you think this is a bug, please try to debug and re-open this issue adding some details.\n. thanks for looking into this. it's strange though that the docs work with my setup.\n. @edwinlunando great. thank you!\n. https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/stable/2.5.x\n. see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/559\n. which grappelli version, which django version?\n. base.htm, line 86:\n{% firstof user.get_short_name user.get_username %}\nso you say that isn't working for your case? any chance to debug this issue?\n. can't reproduce ... models are being sorted fine even without verbose_name/verbose_name_plural with my test case. more details?\n. ok ... finally got it.\n. I currently don't see any performance improvements ... the main issue is that we need to do a request for each and every autocomplete (because the functionality is not built-in with django and the necessary items are not available with an ordinary change form).\n. I don't think pagination is possible (though that is a django issue).\n. IMO django should give us the object representation, but it currently doesn't. If we have the title (for example), we don't need to use an ajax-call when loading the page. I don't see a workaround unless django adds the necessary elements ... but they probably won't.\n. this should already be solved ... which version of grappelli are you using?\n. According to the django docs, you should not assume the admin templates to be rendered correctly, if TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID is set to anything other than an empty string.\nTherefore, what exactly is the issue here?\n. that may be true, but it's a django design decision that admin doesn't have to work if that string is not empty. however, if you're able to submit a patch I'll give it a review (please reopen this issue if you wanna take on that work).\n. @mpasternak I'm -1 on supporting django-compressor out of the box. We should try to limit any dependencies and it's pretty straightforward to get django-compressor up and running (well ... besides the mentioned error with translation files).\n. @msamoylov Sorry, can't follow ...\n. @msamoylov We'll remove ui localization ... see #528 ... https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/pull/528#issuecomment-77523683\n. @msamoylov Let's keep this issue for reference (other people might look for this error message as well). Will do the update within the next couple of days.\n. this is either not easy to solve or I am missing something. first, I'm not able to reproduce this (both collectstatic and compress works fine with my setup). second (and probably more important), there is no file ui.datepicker-en-us.js with jquery/i18n.\n. No 'compress' template tags found in templates.\n. what I don't get here: why would compress look for ui.datepicker-en-us.js since that file is never being referenced within a termplate (as mentioned before, that file doesn't even exist with jqueryUI).\n. I'm about to add a new release, but I would like this issue to be solved before. So please let me know if there's any additional information. \n. which commit exactly? the localized calendar has not been commited IMO.\n. strange for me as well ... lets wait for another reply and see if someone might have worked with your branch instead of master/stable, because that would explain the issues. and that would also explain why I have never been able to reproduce this bug.\nI wanna be sure about this before pushing another version to pypi.\n. I'm closing this since that is not an issue with the currently available branches IMO. Please reopen (with additional details) if you don't think this is solved.\n. are you aware that we fire the lookup-call twice when adding this behaviour?\n. closing this for now since it does not fully work. please send a new PR if you still work on this issue. besides, the \"focus\" is necessary in order for the autocompletes to work.\n. did you define an app_label within your app?\nthe proposed patch is not the right way to solve this \u2013 but I actually doubt that we're talking about a bug here.\n. besides, which django version are you using?\n. Can you please send your INSTALLED_APPS, your URLs, the k2 model and k2 modeladmin (gist is preferred instead of pasting it here).\n. your URLs look a bit strange to me ... both common/k2 start withurl(r'^',. other than that, it looks ok to me. \nadditional question: you don't have apps defined, have you? see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/applications/\n. Closing this since I'm pretty sure it's not a bug (besides, the mentioned functionality is covered with testcases).\n. Good point. I'm actually not quite sure how to solve this. I just tried with not splitting the term (line 139 in related.py) and it works as expected.\nI don't remember why we decided to split the term. It doesn't seem to make much sense (but I might be missing something).\n. Unfortunately, that's currently not possible. But it would be a fine improvement. Any idea on a good implementation?\n. The search-link is generated with Django (not Grappelli) by using raw-id fields. That's the link we use for autocompletes as well.\nThat being said, issue #403 is somehow similar in terms of retrieving ModelAdmin with the frontend. Generally speaking, I think ModelAdmin is the class to look at \u2013 we should try to define the lookup queryset with ModelAdmin instead of relying on autocomplete_search_fields (or maybe combine both setups).\n. Sorry, but I'm not able to follow ... subclassing the widget is bound to a specific field (if I'm using M2Ms I need to subclass a different widget). That seems a bit strange ... or I just don't get it.\n. closing this for now since there hasn't been any updates in a while now.\n. No worries, I just didn\u00b4t have the time yet.\n. interesting ... we just changed that because of a pull request (see #579). what python version are you using?\n. I'm not able to reproduce this ... I'm using Grappelli 2.6.4 and Django 1.7.\nverbose_name = u\"Dergi \u0130\u00e7erikleri\"\nverbose_name_plural = u\"Dergi \u0130\u00e7erikleri\"\nworks fine.\n. @tatterdemalion @twopac @Seleznev-nvkz @robslotboom ... can anybody give me a hint on how to reproduce this with django 1.7 and grappelli 2.6.4?\n. @Seleznev-nvkz thanks, but I don't get an error. works fine with my setup (python 2.7.3, django 1.7, grappelli 2.6.4)\n. alright ... I finally could reproduce this. using \"unicode\" doesn't make sense since python3 uses \"str\".\nmy suggestion is to change line 113 of utils.py to:\npattern_items.sort(key=lambda x: str(x[0]._meta.verbose_name_plural.encode('utf-8')))\nmaybe someone can test this as well and give some feedback. from my point of view, it's a clean solution and it should work with python2 and python3.\n. That's because Grappelli is not yet compatible with Django 1.8.\n. Please try with stable/2.7.x.\n. Please reopen this ticket if the issue still exists. \n. @jieter I'll add a new branch and then let you know (probably tomorrow).\n. please use branch dev/2.7.x instead of master for compatibility with django 1.8\n. Thanks a lot for looking into that. I'll check this issue once we work on compatibility with Django 1.8.\n. @ngzhian There's a new branch dev/2.7.x in order to work on compatibility with Django 1.8.\n. @ngzhian With branch stable/2.7.x (and dev/2.7.x) the related object functionality should be fine. For now, we didn't implement the new \"edit\" feature (we'll do that once all other bugs are resolved). Please give it a try and let me know if there are still issues.\n. closing this since no further feedback has been given (the edit feature is another issue anyway).\n. please use branch dev/2.7.x instead of master for compatibility with django 1.8\n. True. Grappelli is not yet compatible with Django 1.8.\n. closing this since no details are given.\n. please use branch dev/2.7.x instead of master for compatibility with django 1.8\n. should be solved with the mentioned branch. please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. dev/2.7.x is only working with Django 1.8 (it doesn't have to be backwards compatible because there are other versions of grappelli which work with older versions of django).\n. that's much appreciated!\n. Should work now. I'll add a note about adding grappelli.dashboard after django.contrib.contenttypes to INSTALLED_APPS.\n. Closing this for now since all warnings should be gone (with stable/2.7.x). Please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. see #590 \n. which versions (django/grappelli)?\n. Note: Grappelli is not yet compatible with Django 1.8.\n. see #593 \n. same here ... I'm not able to follow this.\n. closing this since no further details are given. please add a new pull-request with additional information.\n. I'm currently taking a look. Unfortunately, I'm not able to merge this since some stuff is missing with RelatedObjetcLookups.js.\n. should be solved with dev/2.7.x and stable/2.7.x ... please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. versions please!!!\n. and which django version???\n. it's fixed (see my commit above)!\n. Sorry, I don't get it ... you want to add <li> to a template without having a surrounding <ul>?\n. I'm not sure it answers my question ... so you actually wanna add list-elements without having a list, right? Isn't that weird?\n. @alex1989 sorry for the delay. happy with the fix?\n. Closing this since it should be fixed. Please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. should work with stable/2.7.x ... please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. that would be nice indeed. does django-admin-sortable work with grappelli? do we just need to change the styles?\n. I'm having a raw-id-field with tabular inlines ... I do get the edit link with the field. The same field within the changeform and no edit link is given. Can someone please explain how this \"feature\" is supposed to work, because I just don't seem to get it!\n. it would be considered ... a consistent implementation is a requirement though (see my first comment).\n. please reopen the tickets with adding versions (django, grappelli).\n. Please add a description to this pull-request. I'm not able to reproduce this issue (I actually don't know what the issue is in the first place). Autocomplete works fine for me.\n. sorry, but that seems to be out of scope. besides, shouldn't that be a django issue instead of a grappelli issue?\nIMHO the filter_horizontal widget should be removed completely.\n. Did you add a ModelAdmin for ContentType?\n. closing this since no further details are given.\n. this is already fixed.\n. you are right.\n. this is already fixed.\n. @oelium cannot reproduce. please open a new ticket and add some details (django.utils.importlib is not available with related.py).\n. there is no django.contrib.admin.util in related.py\n. wrong grappelli version, I guess:\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/views/related.py#L17\n. fixed with stable/2.7.x\n. are you sure that this is a grappelli issue?\n. Please use the Google-Group for asking questions (hint: add Django/Grappelli versions). If you think this is a bug, please reopen this ticket and add some debugging details.\n. @michael-fairfly do you know how that fix is related to this ticket? because the pull-request is about the reversion template, your ticket doesn't mention reversion.\n. alright, thanks for the clarification.\n. @mmarksnippety this pull-request is empty. \n. @nemesisdesign which version of grappelli are you targeting?\n. @nemesisdesign thanks for the clarification.\n. just merging pull requests ... will happen today.\n. Could you please add an example so I'm able to reproduce this issue with my setup?\n. true ... but that's just the template documentation, so not a major issue here. we'll take a look.\n. closing this since nor further details are given. please reopen if this issue still exists.\n. instead of trying to improve get_app_label ... isn't it better to generate the correct link in the first place?\n. I see. \n. what happens if you deactivate grappelli? do you get a different result?\n. can you try to find out what's causing this? because I'm not able to reproduce it.\n. Please use the google-group for asking questions. Thank you!\nBesides: there is a whole lot of answers to this question already (because it is not related to grappelli).\n. search for extending django admin templates (not related to grappelli). you can add custom css with your model admin definition or you can overwrite base.html and add your css there.\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-asset-definitions\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#overriding-admin-templates\n. Thanks \u2013 I'll take a look at this one. Adding checks is a good idea anyway.\nI don't quite get your comment on adding the tests though.\n. python manage.py test grappelli\n. where's the commit?\n. thanks! I'll take a look at the failed test.\n. wait ... you wanna submit more PRs? in that case it's better to wait for all your PRs instead of merging every single one, right?\n. sorry ... working on it. we had to do an intermediate release for 1.8 compatibility. this one's one the list for the next release.\n. I'm getting ImportError: cannot import name 'HTTPSHandler' when trying to run tox. Any idea?\n. ok. got it ... but shouldn't we use 3.5 instead of 3.4?\n. ok \u2013 I'll change that. just trying to figure out why the tests break with 3.5 (seems a bit strange).\n. solved. error gone.\n. thanks again for that PR. while this issue is basically solved ... what about adding travis-ci? any objections?\n. I'm fine with writing the travis file ... \nBut one question remains: If we use travis, we could test with multiple python 3.x versions. However, if I add these versions to tox, I'm not able to run the test locally (because not all different python versions are installed with my machine). I'm not even sure if it makes sense to test with e.g. 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. Maybe it is totally overdone. Any thoughts?\n. did you try to debug this issue? any details?\n. which version of grappelli? which django version? which browser?\n. grappelli 2.7 is not compatible with django 1.7, see http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#versions-and-compatibility\n. thanks a lot for the PR!\n. thanks again (trying to improve yesterdays weak response time).\n. see http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#sortable-excludes\nIf there is one value within the row (e.g. quantity or units) we assume that this row has been added. Therefore the validation error (even with a different field).\n. @jieter any suggestion on the wording?\n. @jieter thanks ... good points. I reopen this ticket as a reminder for updating the docs.\n. @jieter Tried my best to explain the behaviour. Please reopen if you still think we can improve this.\n. thanks for reporting. why do you think python 2.7.9 could be deprecated?\n. just tested the original issue (switch user dropdown) again and it works fine with my setup. I'm closing this issue for now ... please reopen a new one if this error (or one of the others) still exists.\nno worries about the waste of time. you mainly figured it out yourself anyway.\n. are you sure the right actions.js is being loaded (the grappelli one and not the one from django admin)?\n. just check if actions.js is equal to grappellis actions.js (you only need to copy the URL and check with your browser).\n. Well ... then you have to make sure the correct one is being loaded. Seems more like a setup/Django issue than related to grappelli.\n. yep, it's strange indeed. there has been a ticket about this issue a while ago, but I've never been able to reproduce this behaviour.\n. /static/admin/js/actions.js should be the grappelli file (although it probably isn't with your setup). due to the way collectstatic works, you might wanna try to re-install grappelli and then do collectstatic again.\nif you do python manage.py findstatic admin/js/actions.js the grappelli file should be the first one.\n. @SebasSBM this seems like a strange solution, because both /django/contrib/admin/ and /grappelli/ are apps. so changing the order with STATICFILES_FINDERS shouldn't really change anything.\n. filebrowser doesn't interfere. what could interfere though is updating django (after installing grappelli).\nthat being said, I have no clue about which direction to take either. people already opened tickets about this topic \u2013 but soon afterwards, they closed it because of caching or setup issues. I'm glad if somebody is able to find out if this is a problem indeed and if it is related to grappelli.\n. @SebasSBM what do you mean by \"external apps\" vs \"internal apps\"? IMO there is no such difference, there are just apps.\n. see #666 ... seems that your staticfiles are not loaded correctly (esp. actions.js).\n. just by looking at the code briefly this seems like a good change (no reason whatsoever for hardcoding these values).\n. a) searching related fields should be possible\nb) comparing the autocomplete search with the change-list admin search is misleading. these options are not related whatsoever.\nc) defining the autocomplete fields within admin (rather than the model) would be nice. unfortunately, I don't think that's possible. but if someone comes up with a good idea on how to implement that, I'm all ears.\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions ... thank you!\n. I'd use a separate modeadmin instead (with list_editables on the changelist). To be honest, I don't see how pagination with inlines could work ... are you able to show a demo?\n. @theeluwin what exactly is the issue you are having with putting together a PR? do you have in mind that we need to deal with possible form errors on all the different sub-pages?\n. closing this for now ... although it's an interesting topic. happy to take a look at a PR.\n. @vinnyrose thanks (also for using the right branch!)\n. @joshmaker the same is true for fieldset_inline.html, right?\n. @debnet FYI: We're dealing with 1.9 once there's an official release. I'm closing this for now since there's probably tons of issues with 1.9.\n. support for 1.9 is definitely planned ... I hope to find some spare time within the next couple of days. sorry for the delay on this issue.\n. Not reproducable. Can you add details?\n. Well, I could guess ... but that probably doesn't help. Maybe you wanna add this question to the google-group and see if anyone has similar issues. And come back here once we're talking about an issue. Ok?\n. I'm closing this for now. Happy to reopen the ticket if we're able to narrow down the possible issue.\n. @ydaniv one note on this one: if the requests are identical, it seems to be a problem with django (because we just react on errors given by django). on the other hand, you could just try the original django-admin and check if the issue still exists ... if not, it's probably a grappelli issue.\n. this is not related to grappelli, is it?\n. @hhio618 sorry, but I'm not able to reproduce this. can you pls send your custom dashboard class or any other information which might be helpful.\n. grappelli is already working with python 3.4 for quite a while (see travis tests).\n. thanks. there's only one problem: travis currently does not support testing with python 3.5 \u2013 I'm not sure we should implement these updates until we can test properly. any objections?\n. I'm reopening this issue for future reference. Once travis supports testing with 3.5, we'll merge this.\n. thanks. is that PR going to be part of django 1.9?\n. I see ... how do you think we should handle this with grappelli? Wait until it's being implemented with Django or try to figure it out right now? Any preferences?\n. @graingert just tried to use your patch, but I'm seeing lots of errors with my local setup (JS variables not defined etc). is this supposed to work?\n. @graingert I've reverted the merge with stable/2.8.x ... there's just too many issues for me to resolve now (e.g. almost all paths are wrong, you use \"grapelli\" instead of \"grappelli\" etc). happy to take a look at this again if you're sending a tested PR.\n. sorry, but I don't understand that question. you could just use it with any given project.\n. closing this for now. please reopen with a new PR (thanks for your effort on this topic).\n. thanks for the PR. will merge asap.\n. @graingert great stuff. I'll take a look asap ... what do you mean with \"examples\"?\n. sorry, I don't get it ... how are the tinymce examples related to your PR?\n. @graingert I don't think updating the tinymce examples is relevant. There are currently no test scripts for the UI.\n. @graingert working on it. this should be part of the upcoming release compatible with django 1.9, right? or did you plan to have these changes with the current grappelli version as well?\n. @graingert great. we'll release a new version (2.7.3) today (compatible with Django 1.8) because there's been some minor bugfixes. afterwards, we'll work on compatibility with Django 1.9.\n. @graingert is it simple for you to send that PR again (using branch stable/2.8.x)? otherwise I'll try to cherry-pick ...\n. @graingert I was not aware that Django does it that way ... we've always tried to keep master stable with grappelli. But I'll give it a try.\n. @tdruez that issue should be addressed with django reversion first, right?\n. yes, preserve filters is not related to grappelli. it's mainly about using the \"add_preserved_filters\" template tag with links.\n. closing this for now since it's not mainly related to grappelli. once the reversion templates are updated, we'll take a look as well.\n. should be fixed with master \u2013 can you give that a try?\n. @dhararon thanks! will do another release pretty soon.\n. 2.7.3 is out now\n. there's probably lots of errors with django 1.9 ... we'll deal with this once 1.9 is being released (see docs).\n. please use the google-group for asking questions. if you think this is a bug, please add details in order to debug (and try to explain why this error is related to grappelli, if that\u00b4s even the case). did you try to remove grappelli and see if the error exists with the original django admin?\n. Is this a question or a bug report? Any details resp. debugging infos?\n. fixed with stable/2.8.x\n. no idea \u2013 but it should be straightforward to debug this issue. besides, please use the google-group for asking questions ... if you think this is a bug, please add some details.\n. which version of grappelli are you using?\n. is python 3.5 already supported by travis (because it hasn`t been about a month ago)?\n. @dbinetti I think you answered your own question with the 2nd comment. We need to use raw_id_fields, because otherwise we do not get the related link we need to use the js autocomplete workaround. Not sure if we're able to solve this ... if you have an idea, please let me know.\n. are you sure that your staticfiles are set up correctly? do you get the grappelli javascripts and styles?\n. is this solved? can we close this issue?\n. closing this for now since it seems to be a setup issue. please reopen if the problem still exists with the deployed version.\n. @clutcher @ninjaa I see what you mean. But with the proposed \"fix\", we do have another issue - see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/pull/646\n. should be solved, see #685 \n. Hi @ninapavlich and @olivierdalang ... it's great that you both wanna help improving Grappelli (thanks!!!). Unfortunately, we are still not sure about the roadmap. Giving the current structure (e.g. inlines), it's very hard to make it work with mobile devices. Still thinking about a decent solution ...\nConcerning \"hacking\" the CSS to make it a bit less unpractical: Our goal is to offer a good solution, not one which is \"less unpractical\". Therefore, I don't think that's the right way to go.\n. fixed with stable/2.8.x\n. @drxos please note that full compatibility with Django 1.9 is not yet given.\n. sounds good. can you provied tests for this behaviour?\n. fixed with stable/2.8.x\n. @parsch what exactly do you get? works fine with my setup.\n. @michalwerner I do think it's related to django-pipeline. please try again without that package.\n. see #714 \n. sorry, I don't understand your question ... grappelli is not yet compatible with django 1.9. besides, please use the google-group for asking questions.\n. Compatibility with Django 1.9 is planned. And grappelli has a dashboard ... but I still don't understand the question.\n. you are not using grappelli due to your screenshot!\n. you know that the current release is not compatible with django 1.9, right?\n. see #714 \n. these are issues with django.contrib.admin, not grappelli ... right?\n. grappelli 2.7 is not compatible with django 1.9. use grappelli 2.8 and reopen this ticket, if the problem still exists.\n. tested with stable/2.8.x and master ... works for me (might be related to the last commit which fixed popup_response.html). so please give this a try again and reopen if the bug still exists.\n. @tdruez @pombredanne well ... good PR. right branch, easy to follow (including links).\n. @garyelephant closing this for now \u2013 please reopen with additional information in order to reproduce this.\n. @chasepilon you should check if the right grappelli scripts are being loaded (and not the original scripts from the django admin interface), e.g. with using developer tools. I'm closing this for now since it's most probably a setup issue and not a grappelli bug. Please reopen with additional information if you still think this is a bug.\n. @parsch please take a look at this one and fix with stable/2.7.x, stable/2.8.x and (upcoming) stable/2.9.x\n. I don't think that HTML with the admin title has ever been possible ... but if you're able to give me a hint on the specific commit, I'm happy to check this issue.\n. see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/stable/2.6.x/grappelli/templates/admin/base.html#L78\nare you sure that you did not use a custom template?\n. I don't get how this could be affected by Django itself. But I guess I have to give up here (not able to understand/reproduce this issue). Feel free to reopen with additional details (a PR would be useful).\n. What do you mean with \"not working\"? There's now a GO-Button to submit an action.\n. should be fixed now.\n. fixed with stable/2.8.x and master\n. I'm closing this since 2.7.3 is not compatible with Django 1.9. If the problem still exists with 2.8.x, please reopen this ticket.\n. 2.8.1 is still under development and there hasn't been a lot of feedback so far. but I see your point and I'll do a release later today (but please be aware that this version isn't fully tested).\n. alright \u2013 that's good to know.\n. thanks for the PR. we've had some issues with this behaviour in the past (changing the code lots of times). therefore, I'm only willing to change this if a useful test case is provided \u2013 as an alternative, you can try to explain what doesn't work now and what exactly that patch solves (and why it doesn't break any other cases).\n. did you check #706 and #403?\na test project would be useful. the main issue here is that I also \"think\" that it doesn't break any other cases, but I don't really now. and since we had problems with this behaviour in the past, I'm very cautious with merging changes without putting together a decent test case.\n. with \"this behaviour\" I'm referring to building the search query.\n. It's in 2.8.1 (for example).\n. I see. We'll think about doing a 2.7 release with this fix included. Unfortunately, we are not able to add  LTS comparable to django (we just don't have the necessary ressources).\nBesides, we don't say to use the 1.7 branch. First, this branch doesn't exist. Second, we refer to releases (not branches).\n. We decided to not release a new version for 2.7, but you can use the branch stable/2.7.x instead.. what do you plan to do with these docs? I'm not sure they are up-to-date.\n. that makes sense ... you could just copy/paste the URLs to your own urls.py (or outcomment them with grappelli).\n. django uses [wheel] instead of [bdist_wheel]. what should we use?\n. thanks. updated.\n. according to the error relation \"users_mycustomuser\" does not exist it is definitely not related to grappelli.\n. again, this is not a grappelli issue. you cannot use a custom user model without admin attributes (e.g. is_staff) for admin-related features.\n. > Do you mean that a custom user model will break tests programmatically?\nNot necessarily. It depends on the customization, but we are not able to foresee every possible case.\n\nSwitch won't be possible at all with a custom user model?\n\nDepends on the customization. You can check the function switch_user for details.\n\nIs there a place where these \"do and don't\"s are documented?\n\nNo. But if you find something which should be documented, we'll integrate it ... or (even better) you send a PR with the updated docs.\nGenerally speaking, it should be easy for you to figure out what's wrong. You can than either send a PR with the updated code (if tests are included, a merge is easier) or docs or you give us a hint on what we can/should do. \n. with the docs, you are referring to is_staff first and to is_admin later on. besides, why don't we just say that is_superuser and is_staff are required fields with a custom user model if you want to use the switch functionality?\n. not sure how we can solve this. but grappelli works, right? \n. closing this since it's not a grappelli issue. not sure if verbosity is a solution (mentioned with the django ticket).\n. it seems like you're using a custom header, right?\n. no issue with django-reversion, but your screenshot definitely shows a header with a custom height. \n. no, sorry. but check for your header \"Isotek ...\" within your code.\n. please check if this happens without grappelli as well (I assume it's not related to grappelli). you could also use the google-group for asking questions.\n. how can we reproduce this?\n. I'm not able to reproduce this. Still possible that there's an issue ... but without any further details, we are not able to check this. Since it happens for all models, I'd say it's probably a setup issue (unrelated to grappelli).\nPlease reopen with detailed instructions on how to reproduce this error \u2013 since you get it, it should be much easier for you to debug and give us some hints.\n. thanks for the info.\n. can anyone confirm that the proposed solution works with different languages?\n. the block might be a good idea \u2013 I'll take a look.\n. fixed with 78877e1be88836b13c52a993d115e8ecc65600fe\n. please use the google-group for asking questions ... besides, this is not related to grappelli (deleting inlines is a feature of the django admin interface).\n. Here is the documentation: http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dashboard_api.html\nYou could use a custom dashboard, for example. But there's probably different ways to achieve this. Besides, please use the google-group for asking questions.\n. which version of django/grappelli?\n. Not related to the styling issue, but ... you are using an M2M-autocomplete with inlines, right? Is that really necessary?\n. M2M seems good \u2013 alternatively, you could use a FK with an intermediate table (and inlines with the admin interface). The 2nd approach is better, if you need additional fields (e.g. position). But you mix both options ... \n. About the database setup: FK with an intermediate table means that you have inlines with a foreign key ... but you have inlines with M2M (that's done twice). If you post your models here I can tell you more about this.\n. Concerning the styling issue: Is it possible that either your related_label and/or your __str__ method contains HTML characters? If so, that causes the error.\n. 3) that\u00b4s the intended behaviour.\n4) the multiline textbox is fine for M2M autocompletes.\nhowever, I still think you should redefine the relationship with your database using foreign keys instead of many-to-many relations. could you please send the significant part of your models as well as your admin definitions?\nyour models should looke something like this ...\n```\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    (fields)\nclass Tag(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(u\"Name\", max_length=100)\n    slug = models.SlugField(u\"Slug\", max_length=100, db_index=True, blank=True)\n    (additional fields)\nclass TagToParent(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, verbose_name=u\"Parent\", related_name=\"USE_A_GOOD_NAME\")\n    tag = models.ForeignKey(Tag, verbose_name=u\"Tag\", related_name=\"USE_A_GOOD_NAME\")\n    (additional fields)\n```\nand your admin file ...\n```\nclass TagInline(admin.TabularInline):\n    model = TagToParent\n    raw_id_fields = (\"tag\",)\n    autocomplete_lookup_fields = {\n        \"fk\": [\"tag\"],\n    }\nclass ParentOptions(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    inlines = [TagInline]\n```\n. No, it does NOT look similar. As mentioned before, you are combining an inline with a many-to-many relation.  I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to achieve here ... and it is definitely not true that \"Django creates the intermediate table\" (it only does so if you explicitely tell Django). Django does create the M2M-table (but that's not a through-table).\nI'm closing this ticket for now since I'm pretty sure the issue is related to your setup. I would try to clean the models first. And if the issue still exists with a proper database setup, feel free to reopen this ticket.\n. an M2M is essentially the same as an intermediary table with a foreign key (with the 2nd offering more possibilities). so, admin-wise, you either go with a SINGLE M2M autocomplete field ... OR ... with inlines and foreign keys.\nmany-to-many is fine when using tags. but again, you're not using M2M ... your doing an M2M-M2M.\n. glad you solved it ... but I still think your database-setup (resp. model-setup) is not quite correct. but that's a bit out of scope with regards to grappelli.\n. I see what you mean and I generally agree.\nThat said, I'm not sure that the database setup you described with regards to product_name is the best solution ... there's still the possibility of people using the wrong name for similar products.\n. are the autocompletes working? can you do a search within the fields?\n. you need to define the autocomplete lookup fields like this:\nautocomplete_lookup_fields = { 'fk': ['invoice', 'credit_note'] }\n. 1. the tuple is used for searching. with the mentioned example, you search for id (exact) and name (icontains).\n2. key: right. \n3. you need raw_id_fields, because autocompletes is kind of a hack. we need the output of raw_id_fields with the template, because otherwise we do not get the ID.\n. you can use djangos field lookups. not sure why there's an error when removing id__iexact ... that shouldn't be the case (you may wanna try to debug that)\n. I think it only applies to inlines with \"view on site\" (that is, objects with get_absolute_url defined).\n. see #780 \n. I don't fully get this PR ... you say that the issue occurs with Django 1.9, but later you also say it's fine with 1.9. Besides, where exactly do you see this error? Only with the dev branch or with master as well?\n. @tdruez thanks. we are aware of these issue and have not yet started with 1.10 compatibility.\n. solved with stable/2.9.x\n. it is grappelli (not grapelli)\n. nope, the given path is correct\n. definitely interesting, but out of scope. besides, it seems that django-locking is no longer actively developed.\n. Is this related to grappelli or to django-autocomplete-light?\n. No ETA yet. We hope to start working on 1.10 support soon.\n. ETA is set to September 27th. I assume there are some minor updates needed (esp. in order to remove depreciation warnings, but I'll have a closer look asap).\n. solved with stable/2.9.x\n. please use the google group for asking questions.\n. @unaizalakain this PR does not work. if I submit an inline formset with updated positions and I have an error within that formset, the ordering is not correct. happy to review an updated PR.\n. @unaizalakain what do you mean with the formsetsort template? and yes, it has been working and it is still working.\n. @unaizalakain that\u00b4s exactly what I do ... but the order is only messed up with the PR applied (it works for me without your PR). can you do a test with the branch stable/2.9.x and django 1.10?\nbesides, if the sorting is messed up with your PR, you do agree that the PR is not exactly what we need ... right? or did I miss something?\n. @unaizalakain see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/templates/admin/edit_inline/stacked.html#L17 ... the function is called every time the inline templates are used.\n. solved with stable/2.9.x\n. see branch stable/2.9.x ... should work. I'm just waiting for some feedback before the actual release.\n. you can checkout that branch and just play around. tests look fine, but I'm pretty sure there are still minor glitches. and if you do not find any bugs, that's a useful feedback as well.\n. @adamchainz We don't necessarily follow the jQuery updates of Django, but I'll take a look.\n. @florianm master is not compatible with django 1.10 \u2013 take a look at stable/2.9.x instead.\n. @adamchainz what exactly is the issue with jQuery (besides using a different version compared with the Django admin)?\n. > I've been looking around a bit. Django 1.10 upgraded from jQuery 2.1.4 to 2.2.3, but Grappelli 2.9.x is currently replacing that with version 2.1.4 again - shouldn't it be upgraded?\nthat\u00b4s true. but I don\u00b4t see any issues here.\n. > In fact b196350 copied in jQuery 2.2.3 (rather than just dropping the file to prevent static 'shadowing' of django.contrib.admin), but it still shadows jquery.init.js so the end result is that django.jQuery is the 2.1.4 version but window.jQuery is the 2.2.3.\nI'm sorry, but I do not understand this comment.\n. so we just need to add the comments again, right? additionally, we could also update the jquery version.\n. @debnet I'm not able to reproduce this. popups work fine with my setup. are you sure that you're using the updated files?\n. just released 2.9.1 (compatible with Django 1.10)\n. @adamchainz sorry, I don't quite get it ... the file setup.cfg is already there and you didn't change anything, right?\n. @tdruez I'll do a release in the next couple of days. I just waited for some feedback on compatibility with django 1.10.\n. hope this issue is solved.\n. please try branch stable/2.9.x ... 2.8.x is not compatible with django 1.10.\n. @rcooke you are right. we are aware of this issue and decided to not go with the \"?\" since it\u00b4s not consistent. that said, with regards to your usecase it definitely makes sense. we\u00b4ll take another look .... @parsch can you answer that?. change to django-style help text.\n@parsch please add styling. please explain ...\n. @orlra sorry, but I cannot follow. you know that overriding templates is a django issue, right? we don\u00b4t change that behaviour.. We changed this behaviour with Grappelli 2.8. It is not planned to update 2.7 though.. I'm not able to reproduce this. Works fine for me. Any details?. Thanks for the clarification.. we decided to not implement the number field since it behaves (very) different depending on the browser (one browser even accepts an empty field although that field is required, though I don\u00b4t remember which browser that was). I also added a django-ticket when we worked on that issue, but I'm currently not able to find that ticket anymore. However, the django devs agreed that the number field behaves badly (although they decided to stick with their solution).. as @etianen already mentioned, we need to adjust the templates. since I'm personally not using reversion, I didn't recognize that there have been changes according to the templates. my suggestion is to look into the reversion templates and compare it with the grappelli reversion templates and find the diffs. shouldn't be a big deal IMO.. @tsouvarev I don't quite understand where exactly we should use this new method. Any details on this?. that seems like an error with your configuration. if you think this is a bug, please add details and clarify why the noreversematch is caused by grappelli and/or how we could solve this.. I'm not able to reproduce this and it seems kind of weird. Are you saying that the ordering of MyModel interferes with the autocomplete for parent (because one has nothing to do with the other). Can you add more details and try to debug this?. closing this because no further details are given. please reopen if the problem still exists with the correct grappelli/django combination.. @tdruez Thanks for looking into it. I'll check compatibility with 1.11 asap (hopefully next week).. @Cediddi Planned for tomorrow. I'll check the issues and I'm hopefully able to have a new release by Friday.. both mentioned issues are solved with stable/2.10.x. @orlra Did you target branch dev/2.7.x by purpose? Because it\u00b4s pretty outdated \u2014 the development branch for the current version is stable/2.9.x.. see https://django-grappelli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization.html#available-settings . I'm pretty sure this is not related to grappelli. You could try to deactivate grappelli and check if the error still exists \u2013 if that\u00b4s not case, please reopen this ticket.. As said with the docs, these URLs are commented out by default (so you need to change this if you want to use the template docs).. sorry, not able to follow here. can you add an example?. thanks, I'll take a look at this.. FYI: I think I have a solution, but it\u00b4s a quite complicated update and I need to add some tests before pushing the changes.. see #639 . please use the google-group for asking questions (this is an issue tracker).\nhint: js/jquery.grp_timepicker.js (from lines 22). you should be able to use default_time_list.. thx for the pull request. I'll take a look.. can you please try with Grappelli 2.8.3? I'm not saying this issue is solved, but you refer to a version which is not maintained.. any specific reason you did not add the compiled css file?. @parsch can you confirm that this patch looks reasonable?. cool \u2013 thanks.\n. thanks again. please note that I\u00b4m just giving github a try and grappelli is still maintained via google-code.\n. autocompletes are now availabe with the autocomplete-branch:\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/autocomplete\nhttp://readthedocs.org/docs/django-grappelli/en/autocomplete/customization.html#autocomplete-lookups\ntested with firefox, chrome & safari on regular forms, inline-formsets (tabular and stacked) and generic inlines. NOTE THAT THE UI IS NOT FINISHED YET ...\nTODO:\n\u2013 CSS cleanup\n\u2013 check behaviour on changelist.\n\u2013 check errors below fields.\nplease add your thoughts about the current implementation (incl. variable names etc.) and keep in mind that we\u00b4re looking for the most simple solution.\n. TODO: only show \"X\" for fk and generics when the field is not empty\n. TODO: show result-counter and show a message if no results are found.\n. @parsch: long text within fk- and generic-input overflow the remove-symbol\n@parsch: with m2m-autocompletes, the list is much smaller than the div-wrapper\n@parsch: hovers (div, input) are not very nice (probably an issue with djangos fine dom-structure)\n. \u2013 CSS cleanup done\n\u2013 functionality on changelist not possible due to a bug in django 1.3 (update the grappelli-docs accordingly)\n. \u2013 error-fields ok\n\u2013 remove-link is only visible if there\u00b4s a value\n. \u2013 width of menu-items with m2m-autocompletes is fixed.\n. \u2013 clicking labels with autocomplets is fixed.\n. idea: add an \"X\" to m2m-autocomplets in order to remove all items. remove the \"X\" button for every single item ... instead, remove the item by clicking it.\n. @parsch: please check the width of m2m-fields within tabular-inlines.\n. @parsch: the results are now being shown as the first item within ul.menu. instead of <li><a>xxx</a></li> we have <li><span>xxx</span></li> ... needs to be styled. this line is always there (even in case of a server-error).\n. @parsch: some styling-issues with updating jquery & jqueryUI (e.g. the datepicker). uncomment line 50 in grappelli.js and you\u00b4ll see what\u00b4s wrong. some other styles might need a fix as well.\n. @parsch: elements within fk, m2m and generic wrapper are having a slightly different vertical position (with inlines, the items are not centered vertically). the same is true for the remove-link.\n. @parsch: IMO, we need to distinguish single lookups from multiple lookups with adapting the search-icon accordingly (for either related-lookups and autocomplete-lookups). because even with related-lookups, it\u00b4s not obvious that multiple items can be selected. minimal change to the search-icon > far more user-friendly.\n. not necessarily: distinguish by type (object, file), by action (single, multiple) or by type and action. IMO, type is not as important as action.\n. @parsch: check width if several fields are within a row.\n. fixed with the 2.3.4-release.\n. this could be done with a) adding all necessary ui\u2013translation files and b) loading the file based on the defined django\u2013language with:\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n        var url = \"{% get_static_prefix %}grappelli/jquery/i18n/ui.datepicker-{{ LANGUAGE_CODE }}.js\";\n        grp.jQuery.getScript(url);\n    </script>\nhowerver, not every language is available with jquery\u2013ui. can we still use that? any opinions?\n. you mean with adding a custom grappelli templatetag and hardcoded datepicker languages?\n. @pawlyk yes, manually with customized templates (just add the necessary jquery-ui language files).\n. @pawlyk please refer to the google user\u2013group for asking questions. this is an issue tracker. thank you!\n. seems possible after we updated jquery/jquery\u2013UI (see #378). but we don't update jquery with 2.4.x, because there are backwards\u2013incompatible changes.\n. closing this since there's no viable solution (file endings are not equal with django language codes and jquery UI). besides, it's easy to add the files yourself.\n. @parsch: overriding the template is done with admin.ModelAdmin.\ne.g.,\nchange_list_template = \"admin/change_list.html\"\nversus\nchange_list_template = \"admin/change_list_filters.html\"\n. @parsch: results should be behind the sidebar\u2013filters.\n. fixed with 2.4.2\n. did you test with django 1.3? I\u00b4m asking because grappelli is always developed against the latest official release.\n. works fine for me (OSX 10.6.8, safari 5.0.5) with django 1.3.\nI\u00b4m sorry, but djangos trunk is too hard to follow ... especially with 1.4, since some admin-related changes are implemented.\n. can you add more details (e.g. looking at the code and see what\u00b4s happening)? for me, it\u00b4s hard to debug this issue since I\u00b4m not able to reproduce it.\nthis problem doesn\u00b4t exist when you\u00b4re not using grappelli, right?\n. yes, login would be helpful.\n. the wrong (original admin interface) css are being loaded ... it\u00b4s a setup issue. do you use staticfiles?\n. WHAT didn\u00b4t you install with pip? grappelli? no - you don\u00b4t have to use pip (although I recommend using it).\n. the problem is not pip though ... the problem is that the wrong css is being loaded and that\u00b4s related to your django-setup (staticfiles, media_root etc.). sorry, but there\u00b4s not much I can help with.\n. that\u00b4s a bad place to discuss it here ... are you on IRC/skype?\n. the problem is definitely a wrong setup. BUT: if you\u00b4re asking a question and/or don\u00b4t understand how things work, please use the google-group. this is an issue-tracker.\n. if no images are loaded and/or paths/urls are wrong ... setup issue!\nread the django-docs about how to server media and static files. sorry ... nothing we can do about that.\n. @adaaif: yes, but of course that doesn\u00b4t mean your media/static-setup is fine (that\u00b4s a totally different story).\n. @adaaif : sorry ;-)\n. TinyMCEAdmin.js is not using the grappelli-theme (it\u00b4s using o2k7). if you\u00b4re using grappelli, you need to add tinymce_setup.js (or something similar). can you give that a try and let me know if it works?\nnote: it probably makes sense to remove TinyMCEAdmin.js from the repo.\n. no, you shouldn\u00b4t use TinyMCEAdmin.js at all ... you should use tinymce_setup.js. that said, this file is just an example of how a configuration-file could look like (please read the tinymce-docs in order to understand what\u00b4s happening exactly).\nif you add tinymce and tinymce_setup (both which are included with grappelli), there shouldn\u00b4t be an error. I\u00b4ve tested with firefox, safari & chrome (both windows and OSX).\nif you\u00b4re having questions on how to integrate TinyMCE in general, please use the google-group.\n. did you try with django 1.3?\n. honestly ... I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s a grappelli-error. otherwise hundreds of users won\u00b4t be able to use the filter drop-down and I don\u00b4t think that\u00b4s the case. I\u00b4m pretty sure it\u00b4s because of 1.4.0a ... and grappelli is always developed against the latest official release.\n. if you read my last comment you'll see that grappelli is not developed with djangos trunk. \n. I\u00b4m closing this ticket since it\u00b4s related to djangos trunk version. docs have been updated and a note has been added that grappelli is always developed against the latest stable django release.\n. of course, it will get fixed once grappelli is compatible with django 1.4\n. grp.jQuery needs to be there, otherwise no js will work ... we already had that issue with another ticket and it turned out it\u00b4s been a setup issue. are you sure that your javascript-files are being loaded correctly?\n. can you check why grp.jQuery is not there? because it should be. as mentioned before, if grp.jQuery is not there, a lot of stuff won\u00b4t work as expected.\n. which django-version are you using?\n. I\u00b4m using django 1.3 and chrome 14.0.835.94 beta ... can\u00b4t reproduce this bug.\n. when you say \"problem reproduced\" ... are you referring to the login-page only or (as vitorh45 described) every page?\n. are you all using grappelli 2.3.3+?\nsee\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/commit/68e0cc7fe2e573d1dab0691c76b949a2f7d325eb\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/commit/0a8fc04141fef96a08ef227adb3085471cfff9b0\n. I\u00b4m closing this since it seems to be solved with 2.3.3+\n. besides, the ui-sortable-helper class gets overriden by the predelete class.\n. grappelli-skin-default.css, line 748 seems to be the problem:\n.collapse.open.predelete > h4.collapse-handler\n. definitely works ... did you define the related lookups according to the docs? http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#related-lookups. I\u00b4m sorry but we had to change the related-lookups a bit with 2.3+ because of some smaller issues with the former version. it\u00b4s all mentioned in the docs as well as the changelog and should now work very stable.\n. see http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-grappelli/en/latest/customization.html#inline-sortables ... besides that, the latest official release is 2.3.3 (e.g. via pip install).\n. you are so right! accepted (and hopefully fixed soon).\n. fixed, see http://sehmaschine.github.com/django-grappelli/\n. sorry, but I can\u00b4t guarantee the tinymce-files to be up-to-date all the time. that\u00b4s just to much effort. thanks for the patch though.\n. IMO, this should be done with classes instead of alignments. any objections?\n. I\u00b4m closing this for now since I\u00b4m sure this is better solved with using classes.\n. I did unterstand your proposal. what I don\u00b4t understand is why you want to use text-alignments instead of classes (of course you can define classes which will define text-alignments).\nconsider this: you let your editors add alignments to paragraphs and one day you\u00b4d like to change these alignments ... what do you do? IMO, text-alignment is completely redundant (if not dangerous) with \"rich text editing\".\n. no, I don\u00b4t have a better idea. but I guess that you can simply override content_css with tinymce_setup.js.\n. 1. if you use grappelli.dashboard, please remove all admin-tools-apps from your INSTALLED_APPS\n2. which version of grappelli are you using?\n. grappellli is always developed againt the latest official django-release. using django 1.3 will resolve the problem.\n. thanks for the information. unfortunately, there\u00b4s a bunch of backwards-incompatible changes with 1.4 ... that\u00b4s why we stick with 1.3 for now. that said, customizing the admin-interface should be a lot easier with the final release of 1.4 (so we\u00b4re looking forward to that).\n. updating screenshots are already on the todo-list. maybe we\u00b4ll add screencasts as well. but I think that another github-project is to hard to maintain (I rather spend my time improving grappelli/filebrowser). sorry.\n. fixed with the autocomplete-branch since it\u00b4ll be merged soon.\n. please use the google-group to ask question. thanks.\n. nope. bug!\n. thanks. we\u00b4ll check that issue asap.\n. what version of django did you use for this fix?\n. no, that\u00b4s fine. I just asked because most of the recent request are related to django 1.4 ... \n. thanks. we\u00b4ll fix that.\n. note: I\u00b4ll deleted the files with the autocomplete-branch since this branch is going to be merged very soon. closing the ticket since the merge will fix the issue.\n. can you explain that a bit more? what \"Meta class\"?\n. seems a bit overdone for what we\u00b4re trying to do, but we\u00b4ll keep it in mind. thanks for the hint though.\nbtw: we\u00b4ll use compass for the next version of grappelli.\n. we just need the grid \u2013 and with that in mind, it\u00b4s overdone (not in general, but for us). besides, compass nicely integrates with blueprint.\nsorry, but I don\u00b4t understand your last question. grappelli has the same amount of fields, it just looks different.\n. closing this since the next version will be based on compass (and I don\u00b4t understand the second question). if compass integrates with bootstrap, we\u00b4ll re-discuss this issue.\n. We will check Bootstrap with the next major release again.\nBut I have to say, that this (https://wrapbootstrap.com/themes/admin) is not really convincing. Some of these themes look nice at first, but weird when it comes to the details \u2014 though I'm currently not sure if the reason is Bootstrap or the actual implementation.\n. I doubt that this is easily possible ... but we'll check it!\n. well, that would be interesting of course. but before you start working on something like that ... if it's not easy, what exactly are the benefits of doing this? just to say we're using bootstrap? from my point of view, it doesn't make customizing the admin interface easier (maybe even harder) for anyone using grappelli. moreover, we need to adapt with every new version of bootstrap, but we're already having a hard time keeping up with django.contrib.admin (and their inexplicable updates).\nthat being said, I don't wanna block this issue. if you're having some spare time to invest doing a prototype, that's much appreciated (though it doesn't mean we're going to use Bootstrap).\n. @BertrandBordage we're totally open to change our workflow and I basically agree with what you've written. my doubts primarily arise from the admin projects done with bootstrap. for example, the link above posted by leonardo: when I look at these screenshots ... I'm like WTF!\nbut: maybe it doesn't have to be this way. maybe I just need someone to convince me that grappelli won't look that shitty if we use bootstrap.\n. I personally don't care about the \"theme\" ... that could be changed later. what's important in my opinion is that we have the necessary structure/options (e.g. object\u2013tools, footer, date\u2013hierarchy and other stuff). from my experience it's not that easy \u2013 you can't just add boostrap elements to an existing DOM and assume that it will look ok. \nmaybe the misunderstanding is this: when I talk about the design, I'm not referring to colors/fonts/or presentational markup in general. I'm talking about (for example) pixel perfect placement of a filter element beneath a searchbar. If we're able to solve that issue, I'm more than happy to re\u2013evaluate bootstrap for the next major release of grappelli.\n. I\u00b4m also not happy about that situation. but working on grappelli is unpaid \u2013\u00a0so we need to focus on what\u00b4s important for us and our customers. sorry.\nbesides, you\u00b4re free to add patches in order to solve these issues.\n. overriding a change-list template is exactly the same with grappelli and the standard admin interface. but I don\u00b4t understand your question \u2013 why do you need to find out if grappelli is being used? I mean, you\u00b4re the developer, so you should know. guess I\u00b4m missing something, right?\n. alright, I see.\nunfortunately, I don\u00b4t know how to figure out if grappelli is being used. guess you need to check INSTALLED_APPS. on a template-level, you probably need to write a custom template-tag.\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions.\nthanks,\npatrick\n. @parsch: could you please take a look at this one? thanks.\n. yes, I know. but I haven\u00b4t give this much thoughts so far ... do you think it\u00b4s better to throw an error?\n. about your first problem: did you add apps like \"myapp\" and others like \"project.myapp\" to your INSTALLED_APPS?\nthe comparison with how django handles such cases is a good argument. I agree that we should take the same path.\n. I\u00b4ve tried to solve this but I didn\u00b4t find a solution since we\u00b4re able to define models like \"django.contrib.*\" ... which is not in the list of registered items.\nI\u00b4d say we have to stick with the current solution. it\u00b4s not perfect, but on the other hand you shouldn\u00b4t have a problem if you define your dashboard-models like the one you add to INSTALLED_APPS.\nif for example\n\"project.blog\"\nis in your INSTALLED_APPS\nyou need to add something like\n\"project.blog.models.BlogEntry\"\nto your dashboard\n. closing this one since #46 adds a better explanation.\n. grappelli is a requirement for the filebrowser.\nbut you don\u00b4t need to use grappellis tinymce-theme. did you try it with the default tinymce skin?\n. closing this since no reply is given. I guess this is being solved with using the original tinymce-skin.\n. grappelli doesn\u00b4t include all buttons that come with tinymce \u2013\u00a0it\u00b4s only a minimal theme.\n. unfortunately, I don\u00b4t know a quick fix since I\u00b4ve never used pagebreak \u2013 but if you find a solution, please let me know.\n. thx. I\u00b4ll check that and update asap.\n. what url reverse error?\n. you could use a filebrowsefield or an imagefield with the clearablefileinput-widget that comes with the filebrowser (see http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-filebrowser/en/3.3.0/fieldswidgets.html#clearablefileinput). but the question is more related to the filebrowser than to grappelli. \n. how can I reproduce this error?\n. now I see what you mean \u2013\u00a0thanks for the clarification.\nI\u00b4ll take a look at this. The mentioned code shouldn\u00b4t even be relevant because of if request.GET.get('query_string', None):\n. just by taking a quick look at your patch I\u00b4m having a question: you mainly seem to remove image-references in css-files (as well as some grid-styles). doesn\u00b4t this affect the grappelli-layout? sorry, but I\u00b4ve never been using cache storage: can you explain your patch a bit?\nthanks.\n. I see ... you just removed images which are not used. thanks. we\u00b4ll test the patch with our environment an merge asap (this may take a few days since we\u00b4re in the middle of a bigger filebrowser-update).\n. thanks a lot.\n. sorry, but this patch doesn\u00b4t seem to work ... did you tested this without the \"future\" imports? IMO, {% load url from future %} is missing.\n. did you test with the latest official django-release? because grappelli is not developed against djangos trunk. and since we never came across this issue, I suspect it\u00b4s more related to django than to grappelli.\n. interesting. do you get any js-errors?\nbesides, can you please send\na) the model and admin-options you\u00b4re using for the inlines and\nb) the relevant part of the traceback\nthanks.\n. the next version will be namespaced.\n. I could just now reproduce this bug. we\u00b4ll take a look at this!\n. working on it ...\n. bug should be fixed (dynamic-form is now being added correctly). please let me know if you\u00b4re still having problems with this issue.\n. should be solved.\n. how do you refer to the models when adding them to the admin (register ...).\n. thanks. will update the docs.\n. I\u00b4ve updated the docs in order to reflect the issue mentioned by @dannyadair. unfortunately, I\u00b4m not able to reproduce the original issue (which seems to be a different one).\n. docs are updated.\n. mainly because I don\u00b4t get the point. I mean ... we just can\u00b4t support all 3rd-party-apps which are based on the admin-interface and are not compatible with grappelli. where does it lead to?\nbesides, if treemenu needs these icons, grappellis look & feel is gone ... so I suggest using the original admin-interface for that case anyway.\nthis is an unsatisfactory situation for us as well. but as long as it\u00b4s not possible to skin djangos admin-interface in a clean and easy way, we have to make decisions like this.\n. that\u00b4s a reasonable argument and I already said I\u00b4m not satisfied with the situation as is. nevertheless, we\u00b4re not able to support all 3rd-party-apps (that\u00b4s just not possble because it\u00b4s too much effort and we do these projects in our spare time).\nthat said, if you add a pull-request chances are much higher it\u00b4s being implemented (if it doesn\u00b4t interfere with other stuff and it\u00b4s just about adding some images).\n. grappelli doesn\u00b4t include any translations. so it\u00b4s mainly a django-issue. that being said, we should take care that the layout doesn\u00b4t break even if the text-phrase is too long.\n. looks good to me.\njust a small hint if you submit a patch:\nfor backwards-compatibility, I would leave the callback as is (for now).\n. do you still want to submit a patch for this? otherwise I\u00b4m going to close this issue ... although I\u00b4m happy to implement your patch if you find the time to submit it.\n. alright. thanks for the info.\n. please resubmit if that\u00b4s possible. thanks.\n. a question to begin with: what exactly would you do with pre-/post-content functionality?\n. added pre- and post-content. please note that you need to add the relevant DOM yourself ... e.g.\nself.children.append(modules.AppList(\n            _('Administration'),\n            collapsible=True,\n            column=1,\n            css_classes=('collapse open',),\n            pre_content='<div class=\"module\"><div class=\"row\"><p>Adding a <a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Link</a></p></div></div>',\n            post_content='<div class=\"module\"><div class=\"row\"><p>Adding a <a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Link</a></p></div></div>',\n            models=('django.contrib.auth.models.User','django.contrib.auth.models.Group',),\n        ))\n. sorry, I don\u00b4t understand your last comment ... how is feincms connected with grappelli?\n. I still don\u00b4t understand this. as far as I know, feincms doesn\u00b4t support grappelli ... am I wrong?\n. basically, you\u00b4re right \u2013 grappelli replaces the admin site. but if feincms doesn\u00b4t support our templates resp. DOM structure, it won\u00b4t work.\nbackground: because the HTML/CSS of the original admin is a bit of a mess, we are not able to work on the basis with grappelli since it makes the js-part (which again ist just a workaround for some django-limitations) almost impossible. bit of an awkward situation, but there\u00b4s not much we can do about that right now.\n. sorry for that. are you able to split the pull-requests?\n. I\u00b4d prefer a pull-request for every self-contained change/fix. thanks a lot.\n. sorry ... I didn\u00b4t know you can do only one pull request a time. in that case, just leave it as is. I\u00b4m pretty new to git, so I\u00b4ve never used cherry-pick, but I\u00b4ll give that a try.\n. sorry, but I need to close this request ... I\u00b4m not able to see what\u00b4s more or less important and how the different requests relate to each other (and/or to feincms). please re-add the request with additional information on what exactly you want to change and why. thanks.\n. how does tinymce detect the language automatically?\n. besides, that\u00b4s about 1900 additional files ... and the grappelli-plugin for tinymce doesn\u00b4t support all these languages. not sure about this.\n. we\u00b4ve decided to not include all languages (tinymce has been updated with 2.3.8)\n. I\u00b4m ok with adding this if (and only if) the given grappelli-style is preserved. can you send a screenshot?\n. this is just for tinymce, right? because there's other popups in the admin interface as well (eg related lookups). how do we handle these other cases? because IMO it's important to have a coherent solution - not different kind of popups. what do you think?\n. in that case I\u00b4m against merging this (sorry). but consistency is a major issue for us \u2013\u00a0and having different solutions for popups/dialogs within a interface is something I don\u00b4t like at all.\nthanks for the effort though. if there\u00b4s any chance we\u00b4re able to create a decent and consistent solution, we should re-discuss this issue.\n. yes. but that's a backwards-incompatible change with django. so, once 1.4 is released, we'll update grappelli. \n. see #91\n. what version are you using? because I think we just fixed that bug.\n. see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/commit/8997ce912d3e638973507c7edde50a7c05a2cf1c\n. right, it\u00b4s solved with the master-branch, but there\u00b4s no update on pypi yet. I\u00b4m leaving this open for reference although the issue is already fixed.\n. closing this since 2.3.6 will be relased pretty soon.\n. I\u00b4m pretty sure this is related to the tinymce-version (3.4.2) we\u00b4re using with grappelli ... it seems to work with tinymce 3.4.7., so it will be solved when we update tinymce.\n. probably with 2.4 (once django 1.4 is out). but I don\u00b4t know since I\u00b4m only assuming that it comes down to the tinymce-version. if it\u00b4s really an issue with tinymce, I\u00b4m going to update instantly \u2013\u00a0but I need more information on the subject in order to do so ... \n. if you need it fast, you could add a pull-request. please keep in mind that we overwrite some plugins in order to preserve the grappelli-style ...\n. tinymce updated with 2.3.8-release\n. @parsch: isn\u00b4t it better to add grappelli-like arrow-buttons?\n. @honi: doesn\u00b4t work for me (tested with firefox). does it work for you?\n. I\u00b4m on 13.0.1 as well ... you added the line to the stop-function of the sortable, right? \n. sorry ... yes, it does work. the behaviour just seems strange to me (and with all the different inlines I\u00b4m testing with I got confused). so, yes it works, but I\u00b4m not fully convinced we should use this.\n. looks good, thanks!\n. yep. any idea how to solve this?\n. I don\u00b4t see how this could be solved due to browser-issues (since we are not able to serialize a filefield).\n. #134 is a possible solution.\n. what if we\na) serialize the fields (for each row) when loading the changeform.\nb) add the result to each row (just a hidden div with the field-values).\nc) on save, we serialize again (like we do now) and compare the values with the hidden div.\ncould that work?\n. if the values are unchanged \u2013 we don\u00b4t need to save them, because they are already saved. right?\n. I don\u00b4t quite get the point: if you\u00b4re having an extra form with initial data and you don\u00b4t change any values ... why would you want to save this row then? because when I follow your example, all extra forms will automatically be saved (no matter what I do). am I missing something?\n. but we shouldn\u00b4t rely on that.\n. sorry, but I\u00b4m not able to follow this discussion anymore (IMO your argumentation goes in circles). please add a new ticket and try to explain what exactly you want/need to solve. thanks.\n. take a look at #134 ... that\u00b4s a possible solution IMO.\n. I\u00b4m using django-positions as well, mainly for models which have list-editables on a changelist.\nwhen using django-positions with inline-sortables it doesn\u00b4t work (at least that\u00b4s my experience). I haven\u00b4t been looking into django-positions to figure out what exactly does break there \u2013 but I\u00b4m pretty sure this is not an issue we can solve with grappelli, right?\n. any updates on this one?\n. I\u00b4m closing this issue for now. please re-open with additional information if needed. thanks.\n. can you explain your patch? what does it actually solve and why?\n. ah, ok. you know that we always develop against the latest official release of django, right? so, this \"error\" is intentional. we\u00b4ll update grappelli once 1.4 is released (because there are backwards-incompatible changs with the admin-interface).\n. I don\u00b4t think that\u00b4s something which should be configurable with grappelli. I personally don\u00b4t like/use the app-index at all, but it should be solved with django (and not with grappelli).\nI\u00b4ve mentioned this several times before: django orders your models based on apps. but I\u00b4m pretty sure, no customer/editor is interested in the structure of your \"apps\". to me, this doesn\u00b4t make sense at all ... still a \"-1\" on \"fixing\" this with grappelli.\n. well, I think the whole admin-interface has been built with developers in mind: e.g., the index-page is just a list of \"INSTALLED APPS\" (try to explain that to an editor).\n. closing this since it\u00b4s not a grappelli-issue (although I hope that it will be solved with django).\n. -1 for this \"solution\".\n. which version of grappelli are you using?\n. this should be solved with the master-branch. please reopen the ticket if the issue still exists.\n. thanks \u2013 just committed your code.\n. yes, that\u00b4s the intended behaviour. any problems with this?\n. sorry, of course you don\u00b4t need to populate the sortable-field but one of the other fields with any inline ... if the serialization of all inline-fields returns something, the sortable-field gets populated.\n. any js-errors? did you do the setup of the sortables according to the docs?\n. now it\u00b4s clear: serializing a file-field doesn\u00b4t work. so unfortunately, the sortables are not working with a single file-field. and I don\u00b4t think there\u00b4s a solution, because of the way file-fields are handled with html.\n. closing this one. if you feel that your issue hasn\u00b4t been solved yet, please add another (working and tested) pull-request. thanks.\n. see #91\n. I\u00b4m sorry but this pull-request seems quite strange to me (see my 2 comments on your requests).\n. 1. just added a fix for the term \"1 result\" with pagionations.\n2. you need to add missing translations directly with django.contrib.admin (I think they use transifex).\n3. I\u00b4ve added your other translation fixes as well (thanks for that).\nbut no, the templates from django-admin-tools are being used for the dashboard excklusively.\n. is this solved with django admin 1.3? because relatedobjectlooup.js is basically a copy ...\n. I\u00b4m pretty sure django handles raw-id-fields and radio-lists as well (but I didn\u00b4t check that).\nhowever, if you add a pull-request I\u00b4m going to merge it.\n. thanks. I\u00b4ve decided to remove title_url from the docs (use pre_content or post_content instead).\n. thanks. no pull-request needed ... we\u00b4ll check that.\n. thanks. merged the other pull-request though.\n. what if we\na) serialize the fields (for each row) when loading the changeform.\nb) add the result to each row (just a hidden div with the field-values).\nc) on save, we serialize again (like we do now) and compare the values with the hidden div.\n. see also #96\n. @funkybob: could you add more details please? we\u00b4re not able to reproduce it by what you\u00b4ve written.\n. @funkybob: what version of grappelli are you using? 2.3.8? moreover, why do you define \"pk\" as an autocomplete_lookup_fields (shouldn\u00b4t \"unter\" be the autocomplete)? did you check the serialisation (e.g. with using console.log on the javascript)?\nfor debugging, you could add console.log(fields) after:\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/templates/admin/edit_inline/tabular.html#L265\nwhich should log something in your case ...\n. do you want to try with 2.3.8? because 2.4 is not yet released ... if the problem exists with 2.3.8 it\u00b4s actually a \"bug\" \u2013 with 2.4. it\u00b4s just not finished yet.\n. thanks a lot for checking that \u2013 we\u00b4ll take a look at the 2.4 branch.\n. should work with the 2.4-branch now (the sortable-exclude issue hasn\u00b4t been solved though).\n. closing this in favor of #134 which offers a solution (not implemented with the 2.4-branch yet).\n. totally agree \u2013 will update to 2.3.7 on the weekend (I didn\u00b4t check with 2.5). thanks!\n. see #91\n. see #91\n. well, grappelli 2.4+ won\u00b4t work with django 1.3 anyway (because django introduced some backwards-incompatible changes with the admin-interface). I have to look through all the changes coming with django 1.4, but yes \u2013 if the tags are not used with the django-admin we can remove them. btw: the branch to work on for django 1.4 compatibility is grappelli_2_4 (just in case you wanna add a pull-request).\n. hi,\nwe\u00b4re working on it ... but there\u00b4s no schedule yet since we\u00b4re updating\nall CSS to compass.\nI could say we\u00b4re probably done in about 3 weeks, but don\u00b4t take this for\ngranted.\nbest,\npatrick\n2012/4/16 Simon Heimler <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nHi there,\nany Idea when Grappelli is ready for Django 1.4?\nI've tryed the Grappelli 2.4 Branch but it didn't work for me.\nGreets, Simon\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/91#issuecomment-5147860\n. all issues mentioned here are solved with the 2.4-branch.\n. no, you\u00b4re not using the static-tag, do you?\n. I\u00b4m talking about {% static \"...\" %} ... like with the original admin from 1.4\n. you don\u00b4t need to since I\u00b4m also changing the templates ... I\u00b4ll check your other changes and implement them asap.\n. besides \u2013 would you agree that we need to use {% static \"admin/...\" %} instead of {% static \"grappelli/...\" %} and rename the /static/grappelli/ to /static/admin/ ... otherwise we are not able to overwrite the original static-files ... right?\n. looks good, thanks \u2026 we\u00b4ll do it that way.\n. I\u00b4m not sure I can follow ... but I\u00b4ve done some tests with my current grappelli_2_4_branch and most things seem to work fine (besides the multiple sorting on the changelist). so I guess we can take that as a basis.\n. my thoughts ...\nwe have these 2 folders:\n/static/admin/\n/static/grappelli/\n\nthe first folder (/static/admin/) is needed because there\u00b4s hardcoded stuff with the django admin\u00a0expecting files to be found within that folder (which is {% static \"admin/...\" %}).\nwith grappelli, we can use a different static-tag (which is {% static \"grappelli/...\" %}, but only where we\u00b4re able to change the tag (and not for any hardcoded stuff).\nI agree that we don\u00b4t need to duplicate files, because collectstatic will find these files anyway. however, since we\u00b4re having at least minor changes within every js, I\u00b4m +1 on duplicating all admin-files.\n. we\u00b4re close.\n. no, sorry \u2013\u00a0we\u00b4re doing this in our spare time and it\u00b4s hard to guess what our customers are up to.\n. same with filters ... check all overlay for closing when\na) clicking somewhere else\nb) ESC\n. with django 1.4/grappelli 2.4, this issue should be solved ... right? because when using collectstatic, the gis-images are there and since ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX is deprecated, the path/url to the images should be fine as well. \n. theoretically speaking, the field with the default value should be excluded from the serialization when doing the sorting ... right?\n. because the sortable field reacts to any inputs/changes by a user \u2013\u00a0but a default value is not a changed value ... so why should the sortable field react to that field? am I missing something? do we need to re-define the sortables and if yes, what could a (new) definition be?\n. @funkybob: no, that\u00b4s not an issue. did you define blank=True and null=True for your sortable field? if not, you should do so.\nthe example you mentioned (with the 3 fields) should definitely work \u2013 this is something we\u00b4re using for almost every project.\n. I\u00b4ve just tested with jsfiddle and\nvar fields = $(this).find(\"div.td :input[value);\nDOES pick up hidden inputs.\n???\n. see http://jsfiddle.net/sehmaschine/Myc29/ ... this could also include file-fields (although I don\u00b4t quite like the syntax with the field-loop).\n. I\u00b4ve never came across hidden inputs within 2 and 4 (at least not inputs which could/should be changed with having an effect on sortables). do you have an example?\n. 1. what do you mean with \"... the hidden inputs at position 2\"? which \"hidden inputs\"?\n2. and I still don\u00b4t understand why you wanna select fields with default values ... yes, it might be the solution for your problem, but theoretically speaking it\u00b4s not a good idea IMHO (because it doesn\u00b4t work with extra-rows).\nhowever, you might wanna take a look at #134 ... I\u00b4ve update the jsfiddle in order to work properly with file-fields and default values (hope I didn\u00b4t miss anything).\n. IMO #134 offers a proper solution (codewise, it\u00b4s not perfect but it deals with file-fields and ignores default values).\n. closing this in favor of #134 which offers a solution.\nnote: with my last question (nr. 1) I\u00b4ve been asking for examples of \"hidden inputs\" on position 2 ... these inputs currently don\u00b4t exist in my opinion and I still don\u00b4t understand what kind of inputs you\u00b4d like to see there.\n. thanks for the hint \u2013 we\u00b4re working on django 1.4 compatibility!\n. see #91\n. fixed the first issue, but decided to not go for the second one (maybe I don\u00b4t fully understand the benefits).\n. we often define custom change forms with overriding the grappelli change form (e.g. for changing object-tools).\nwhat exactly is not working for you?\n. why would you want to extend the change-form if you need to override it (for all objects)? when you add change_form_base, the same problem occurs with this template, right (if I extend change_form_base)?\nI agree that django admin templates aren\u00b4t very customazation friendly, but I\u00b4m not sure we\u00b4re talking about a bad design decision here. I\u00b4m ok with finding a better solution, but adding a _base template (which we need to do for every other template as well) doesn\u00b4t sound sensible to me.\n. I agree with everything you say here (thanks for the explanation). we\u00b4ll discuss that issue and may implement the _base templates.\n. sorry, but our goal with grappelli is to NOT add locales ... IMO we should use the jquery-localization for this one (if that\u00b4s possible). the reason we don\u00b4t add locales with grappelli is that it adds another layer of complexity (using transifex, keeping the locales up-to-date etc). appreciate your effort though.\n. if you download jqueryUI you\u00b4ll find the datepicker-locales ...\n. besides, if you\u00b4re willing to add a transifex-project and manage (!) that project for grappelli-locales, I\u00b4ll think about it.\n. hmm, \"done\" is part of the datepicker, see http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#buttonbar\ntelling from my experience with django-filebrowser: you don\u00b4t wanna do it!\n. closing this for now since different topics have been mentioned. please add a new ticket with a specific description. thanks!\n. thanks. FYI: both trunk and grappelli_2_4 are under development. for production use, please refer to the releases (tags or pypi).\n. can\u00b4t reproduce with either 2_3 and 2_4\n. see #91\n. see #91\n. see #91\n. I think it\u00b4s not possible to allow for several date formats with the jquery-datepicker ... is it?\n. can\u00b4t reproduce \u2013 for me, the typed date has a white background when the calendar is opened.\n. see #91\n. it\u00b4s not because of the tinymce version.\nnote to myself: it\u00b4s the onsubmit function with the html-file (pastword.html).\n. is there an english site?\n. thanks \u2013 it looks like a decent app, but without an english documentation ... sorry.\n. hmm, english translation is good ... and I\u00b4d love to get rid of tinymce and I like the redactor-style (the general look & feel is much better compared with tinymce) but: do you really think that editor is already working with a productive environment? I\u00b4ve been playing with the demo and unfortunately it doesn\u00b4t seem mature (e.g. indent/outdent not working, senseless functions like font-color and font-background, no obvious method to change blockformats, no post cleanup, link and image classes missing, strange code like img style=\"cursor: default;\"  ...).\na bit too much from my point of view. and I\u00b4m not a fan of tinymce at all \u2013\u00a0but replacing some crap with something else that\u00b4s not really working ... \n. thanks \u2013 good find.\n. you mean the error pops up with jquery-UI? if so, there\u00b4s not much we can do about it ...\ndoes it work when you remove jquery-UI?\n. what do you mean with \"add attachment\" resp. \"delete attachment\"?\n. do you mean inlines? there\u00b4s nothing like an \"attachments admin page\", right?\nand yes, the add-inline buttons do work with the stable version of grappelli. please reopen the ticket with additional information (e.g. a screenshot) and exactly describe the issue (if it actually is an issue). thx.\n. here\u00b4s on overview of the js: http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-grappelli/en/latest/javascripts.html\nbut you don\u00b4t need django- or grappelli-js to use the datepicker \u2013 it\u00b4s jquery-UI.\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions. this is an issue-tracker. thanks!\n. where do we use function-based generic views with grappelli?\n. oh, right \u2013\u00a0forgot that we added these urls ... thx.\n. no, there\u00b4s currently no effort to collaborate with django-admin-tools (more). we think that it\u00b4s a great project, but there are some design decisions we don\u00b4t agree with. however, it should be easy to add custom menus/widgets/groups/modules (esp. with the DOM-documentation available with grappelli 2.4).\nI\u00b4m closing this issue since our philosophy is to keep grappelli as clean and minimal as possible (while extending flexiblity in order to add custom items). please reopen if you think I missed something or didn\u00b4t fully understand your proposal.\n. not sure I\u00b4m able to follow. you\u00b4re talking about 2 different issues, right? first, the \"other plugin\" and second the way we\u00b4re calling functions ...\n. closing this for now \u2013\u00a0please reopen if you have additional details.\n. @parsch: I personally prefer the old action styling (no backgrounds, a bit smaller and generally less intrusive). \n. @parsch: click filter, click filter again (not selecting anything), move mouse away \u2013\u00a0background of filter is black.\n. it serializes file-fields, but we\u00b4re still facing the issue with default values:\nwhen we serialize the row, we don\u00b4t know if a value is a default one or not (and we don\u00b4t have a chance to check that). so, every row with a default value will be serialized and the sortable value will be set ... but that doesn\u00b4t make sense for extra-rows with a default value (because I want this rows to be excluded if no other value than the default one is given).\ntherefore, we need to add a field with the initial value counter and onSubmit compare the value of that field with the new serialized value counter.\nUPDATE: instead of a counter we store the serialized row with a hidden-field.\none problem still remains:\nif the user changes a default value (e.g. change \"xxx\" to \"yyy\" with input_text_003) the row isn\u00b4t marked as being changed ... so far, that\u00b4s no problem. but if the user now manually deletes the value of the sortable field, the row is missing. this could be solved with using a hidden-field or a readonly-field with sortables.\nUPDATE: this problem is solved with comparing the serialized fields.\nbesides: most problems with selectors in the 2.4-branch are results of jquery (1.7.2) changing the behaviour of :input (compared to 1.6.2). that\u00b4s already updated with the latest version of the branch.\n. even better than mine. thanks a lot \u2013 will update the branch today and then we can do some testing.\n. I did some testing and unfortunately, it doesn\u00b4t work with your proposal: the main problem is that form-rows can be removed and the row-index is being updated. so if we store initial values with the row-index (I couldn\u00b4t think of another way), it\u00b4s starting to get complicated.\nany ideas?\n. after some additinal testing, it\u00b4s far more complicated: serializing initial values won\u00b4t work, since these \"initial values\" will change after submitting the form. so, if there\u00b4s an error and the page is displayed a 2nd time, the \"initial values\" are different than before ... therefore, we can\u00b4t use them.\nthe only chance for this to work is to somehow get the real initial values from django \u2013\u00a0but unfortunately, these values are not there.\n. how did you manage to get the default values? because that's what we actually need. \nbesides, we need the values on a per inline form row basis (not for the whole form).\n. using initial values doesn\u00b4t seem a proper (and clean) solution. so I tried something different (see last commit):\nit takes file-fields into account and I\u00b4ve added a setting \"sortable_excludes\" (either list or tuple) in order to define fields which should not have any effect on the ordering. I\u00b4ve done some pretty extensive testing and (so far) it works for all my test cases ...\nwhat I don\u00b4t like and/or could be improved:\na) the fields selector:\nvar fields = $(this).find(\"fieldset :input[value][value!=''][type!=radio][type!=checkbox],input:checked,input[type=file]\") ...\nmaybe this can be done easier? note that :input[value] has changed with the latest jquery-version.\nb) comparing value and sortable_excludes:\nif ($(this).val() && $(this).attr(\"name\") && $.inArray($(this).attr(\"name\").split(\"-\").pop(), sortable_excludes) == -1)\nwe need to use \"name\" since there are (custom) widgets (e.g. autocompletes) which add form-fields without the name-attribute (and therefore should be excluded).\nc) I didn\u00b4t check for performance. not sure if this is faster/slower compared with the previous solution based on \"serialize\".\nfeedback/testing is very much appreciated.\n. any complaints about this solution? otherwise, I\u00b4m going to close this ticket.\n. I\u00b4ve tested quite extensively and it seems to work. closing this for now.\n. a probably better solution is to focus the search-input when closing the related object window.\n. add options.wrapper_search.find(\"input\").focus(); to lookup_id with jquery.grp_autocomplete_m2m.js ... it works but means that the search-field being focussed onload (which is not what\u00b4s needed).\n. fixed\n. no, this is not related to inlines.\n. hmm, works fine for me (tested with fieldsets, tabular and stacked inlines). what do you mean with \"values are not displaying properly\".\nnote: with tabular-inlines, the class grp-readonly is misssing (but that\u00b4s just a design issue).\n. you\u00b4re right \u2013\u00a0it now works for me (with multiple fields as well) with the latest commit by parsch.\n. works for me \u2013 do you have an action with an intermediate page?\nI\u00b4ve added print request.POST.copy() to my custom action and \"_selected_action\" is there.\n. if I\u00b4m using \"select all\", request.POST.copy() gives me all records (_selected_action is limited to the records on the first page, but that\u00b4s intended behaviour I guess).\n. yes, I\u00b4m on the 2.4-branch.\ndon\u00b4t know why you can\u00b4t assign labels ... but we\u00b4re taking care about that (if you\u00b4re referring to github-issues).\nisn\u00b4t there only one \"select all\"? first, I\u00b4m clicking the checkbox on the top left \u2013\u00a0to select all items on the current page, then I\u00b4m using \"select all\" in the footer-area (right beneath the select-field for actions).\nplease not that the styling of the footer is not finished yet: e.g., \"select all\" shouldn\u00b4t be visible when loading the page.\n. we\u00b4re going with the django admin behaviour here \u2013\u00a0first select all items on the page, then you get the option to \"select all\". changing the two-step process is another discussion (I\u00b4m ok with the current behaviour, but I don\u00b4t use actions a lot).\n. should be fixed \u2013 please reopen the ticket if you\u00b4re still seeing errors. \n. 1) because it looks more centered (vertically), although it isn\u00b4t.\n2 and 3) hard to argue. to me, the old version looks more balanced/unified.\nmoreover, I\u00b4m not sure about the text-shadow with headlines, because of missing repitition.\nand I prefer the slightly bigger padding with form-rows (see 2.3.8).\n. @parsch: dashboard index shows models with font-style: normal, while app index show it bold. \n. @parsch: IMO, .grp-help could have a color like #999.\n. @funkybob: there\u00b4s a problem with hiding rows with inlines. the only attribute we get is field.is_hidden, but we don\u00b4t get line.is_hidden ... therefore, it\u00b4s hard to achieve this. any ideas?\nbesides, I\u00b4d consider this a django-bug.\n. This bug should be fixed with Django.\n. even worse with tabular inlines, where the \"X\" (of autocompletes, if given) is being moved to the right.\n. non-form-errors look ok (not sure if we can do any improvement there).\nin order to reproduce, the easiest way is to just add the errorlist with the template (search for non_form_errors with stacked.html and tabular.html).\n. field-errors and non-field-errors\n. besides, I\u00b4m not sure if the items should be red\n. any idea how to solve this? just add a 2nd jQuery-namespace?\n. inline.js (and inline.min.js) has never been available with grappelli. and it doesn\u00b4t make sense to include these files, since they won\u00b4t work anyway.\nsorry, but I don\u00b4t get the point about FeinCMS: this app is not compatible with grappelli in the first place, right?\ntheoretically speaking, I think it\u00b4s a good idea to keep 3rd-party-apps in mind ... on the other hand, we avoid conflicts if we use a distinct grp-namespace for jQuery.\n. that\u00b4s exactly what I\u00b4ve been thinking about ... I\u00b4ll test it.\n. interesting (works for me). prepopulate is not even part of the grappelli-javascripts.\n. @bjudson if collectstatic does not copy the file, there's something wrong with your setup ... that should definitely work. any details are appreciated.\n. django.jQuery is there ... and I\u00b4m not getting any js-errors. are you using the latest version?\n. very strange \u2013 I just checked again and I don\u00b4t get any js errors. I\u00b4ve tested with DEBUG = True (loading the original js) and DEBGU = False (loading the minified grappelli js).\nthe distinction between django.jQuery and grp.jQuery shouldn\u00b4t be a problem (this is done by purpose in order to namespace all grappelli javascripts). I don\u00b4t think this can cause the js-errors you\u00b4re getting.\nIs grp.jQuery defined? (e.g. testing with the firebug console)\n. thanks \u2013\u00a0I\u00b4ve removed the second media.js.\n. right, we\u00b4ll explain that better ... autocompletes are (currently) alternatives for related/m2m/generic lookups.\n. you\u00b4re using grappelli 2.3.8 instead of the 2.4-branch, right?\n. depends what you want ... master is not compatible with django 1.4 (see documentation).\n. no problem \u2013 we\u00b4re about to release grappelli 2.4 this week (actually, it should have been released last week already).\n. We assume that grappelli-users know how collectstatic works.\n. closing this one since it should work with stable/2.4.x ... please reopen the ticket if the problem still exists.\n. @parsch: empty li needs styling\n. I don\u00b4t fully understand your pull-request:\na) the original django templates use a different approach, right?\nb) if we use \"url from future\" and the new url-syntax, why only for a couple of templates (and not all of them)?\n. thanks \u2013 but that doesn\u00b4t really answer my two questions (or I just don\u00b4t get it).\n. Actually, I do have doubts ... because the first file you\u00b4ve changed (delete_selected_confirmation) already throws an error because of \"opts\" ...\nand I still don\u00b4t understand why we need \"url from future\" when the original admin interface doesn\u00b4t use it.\nsorry for being so sceptical, but your patch doesn\u00b4t seem to be tested.\n. ok. If you send a patch, please use the branch \"stable/2.4.x\" ... thanks! if your patch is tested, we\u00b4ll merge the changes.\n. @michaelmior as said before \u2013 well-tested (!!!) patches are welcome.\n. @michaelmior  please submit a patch against stable/2.4.x ... we\u00b4re about to release a new version within the next couple of days btw.\n. sorry, but I\u00b4m not able to follow \u2013\u00a0what \"a\"-tag are you talking about? which \"JS code\" looks for an \"a\"-tag within the URL? \nplease add some details. closing this in the meantime, since it\u00b4s not reproducable with the information given.\n. what do you mean with \"our project main template\"?\n. sorry, I don\u00b4t think I can follow ... you mean the admin interface base-template, right? because grappelli is not supposed to work with anything else than djangos admin interface ... am I missing something?\n. can you send me a screenshot of what you want to achieve?\nyou can override that file and add (for example) a top-section ...\n. well, in that case I\u00b4d override base.html ...\nI still don\u00b4t fully understand the background of this issue, but (for now) this seems to be a very rare case to me (and therefore, I wouldn\u00b4t support something like that out of the box).\n. did you add the field to your form? it should definitely work with generic relations ...\n. do you see the position-field?\nbesides: which version of grappelli and django are you using?\n. it\u00b4s\nsortable_field_name = \"position\"\nsee http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#inline-sortables\n(please reopen the ticket if it still doesn\u00b4t work)\n. no problem \u2013 seems like a feasible update. however, I don\u00b4t think FeinCMS works with grappelli anway \u2013\u00a0does it?\n. what do you mean with \"the updated tinyMCE\"?\n. you\u00b4re talking about this file, right?\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/stable/2.3.x/grappelli/static/grappelli/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/paste/pastetext.htm\n. ok \u2013 same plugin.\n. FYI: just released a new version (2.3.9), compatible with django 1.3\n. looks fine to me.\n. sorry ... what do you mean with \"add in the changes\"? they are already added ... the styling is missing for now, but @parsch will update soon.\n. nope, thanks.\n. done (available with 2.4.1).\n. what version of grappelli and filebrowser are you using? we just fixed this issue with the stable-branch ...\n. ok. I\u00b4m closing this since it\u00b4s already fixed. new releases will be available on pypi soon.\n. are you having a screenshot? because I\u00b4m not sure I can follow ... why do you need to scroll if the window size exceeds the popup width? which popup btw? are you talking about add-another?\n. alright, now I see (thanks for the clarification).\nI\u00b4m using chrome 21 as well, but I\u00b4m able to see the save-button (no need for scrolling). that being said, the window is too small (about 20 to 40px, I guess). we\u00b4ll take a look at this issue ...\n. @parsch: is this fixed?\n. I\u00b4m having the same setup, but I\u00b4m not able to reproduce this. the file actions.js is being loaded correctly?\n. if this problem still exists with 2.3.9 or 2.4.2, please reopen the ticket. I\u00b4m not able to reproduce this.\n. @DrMeers any idea when/why this happens?\n. @pedrospdc what do you mean with \"couldn\u00b4t handle\"?\n. @DrMeers so you think that 2.3.5 is more compatible with IE8? if so, why?\n. @DrMeers it should already be IE8 compatible (more or less). if you see any issues, please open a new ticket with details. but I\u00b4m not saying that grappelli will ever work perfectly with IE8 (that\u00b4s just not our main goal).\n. grappelli is always developed against the latest official release (which is 1.4.x right now). unfortunately, we don\u00b4t have the resources to always keep up-to-date with djangos master-trunk. therefore, I have to say ... no, django 1.5.x will be supported once it\u00b4s officialy released.\n. if it\u00b4s backwards compatible with 1.4.x, yes. otherwise no (sorry).\n. I would totally support that as well. question is: who\u00b4s going to submit a well\u2013tested patch?\n. can\u00b4t see the screenshot\n. hmm, can\u00b4t reproduce \u2013 looks good with my setup. any details?\n. well, it seems you don\u00b4t have change\u2013permissions!\n. @epicserve: your fix introduces change_url which has been removed with django recently. instead, I\u00b4m going to change the model\u2013list template.\n. the release is already out (2.4.2). just pip upgrade.\n. absolutely \u2013 if it works, we\u00b4ll accept the patch. please patch against stable/2.4.x.\nbesides, 2 minutes is a very long time ... how many foreign keys do you have? our test\u2013environment is pretty extensive (esp. with relationships), but I never wait that long (max. 10 seconds with hundreds of inlines).\n. what about this one? https://github.com/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light \nI didn\u00b4t test it ...\n. @BertrandBordage problem with django-ajax-selects: generic relations are missing.\n. I\u00b4m open to patches ... \n. @BertrandBordage I\u00b4ve added your changes to stable/2.4.x and I\u00b4m currently trying to cleanup the code ... can you explain why exactly you\u00b4ve chosen the given functions? e.g., any reason why you\u00b4re working with a function search_term, but without any filtering function (instead the filters are part of get_queryset)? More generally speaking, can you please explain your code ... thx.\n. see #239\n. the latest release is 2.4.1 (pypi).\n2.4.2 is the version of the master\u2013branch (next release, current development version).\nso, this looks fine to me ...\nconcerning the js, there shouldn\u00b4t be any difference between 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 \u2013 if you\u00b4re seeing any errors, please open another ticket. thanks.\n. @parsch: please take a look at this. the link to \"password reset\" needs to be styled and of course the reset\u2013form as well.\n. @camilonova pypi will be updated once the next release is due.\n. if django doesn\u00b4t support this, how could we add it (without using the python\u2013part of djangos admin interface)?\n. problem is ... the diff refers to options.py (a file which is not part of grappelli). I\u00b4ll take a closer look, but I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s possible (although I like to see the feature as well).\n. I think anyone can send a patch \u2013 if you add tests, chances are much better though.\n. closing this ticket for now (because it\u00b4s mainly related to django and not to grappelli), although I\u00b4d love to see this feature.\n. Are you sure you\u00b4ve cleared the cache and you\u00b4re loading the right files?\nbecause I\u00b4m not able to reproduce this (and I\u00b4m pretty sure this bug doesn\u00b4t exist).\n. I\u00b4ve checked again and I\u00b4m not able to reproduce this ... please re\u2013open the ticket if you think it\u00b4s a bug.\n. I\u00b4m using staticpatterns, but I\u00b4m still not able to reproduce this.\n@philwo you\u00b4re saying that grappellis jquery.js doesn\u00b4t get loaded. if that\u00b4s the case, there\u00b4s a lot of functionality which doesn\u00b4t work, right (e.g. autocompletes)? basically, not much of the admin will work as expected ... \n. since we\u00b4re about to do a new release, it\u00b4d be nice to solve this issue ... \n1. it seems that STATICFILES_FINDERS is not being used with runserver (I\u00b4m able to reproduce that).\n2. still, I\u00b4m not able to get django override the grappelli files (unless I\u00b4m adding \"django.contrib.admin\" before \"grappelli\" with INSTALLED_APPS).\nany additional information is helpful ... thx.\n. @maffacow since I\u00b4ve never been able to reproduce this issue, I need to rely on feedback. so far, I\u00b4m not sure what a \"fix\" could be ... \n. well ... you can debug, find the issue (if it actually exists) and submit a pull\u2013request. that\u00b4s the most straightforward way to solve it.\n. @ulmus that's a good point \u2013 we'll update the docs with that info.\n. @idboehman thanks for the hint, but I'm very certain that GRAPPELLI_INDEX_DASHBOARD is not related to the actions whatsoever. My guess is that this issue is caused by caching (could be browser\u2013cache, could be old .pyc\u2013files).\n. @zzart if you need a symlink there\u00b4s something wrong with your staticfiles setup ... all staticfiles should be found automatically when doing collectstatic.\n@tufelkinder djangos built\u2013in jquery is overriden by grappelli (there is no content with jquery.min.js).\n. @grafa but the file /static/admin/js/jquery.js is empty, see\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/static/admin/js/jquery.js\nanother idea \u2013\u00a0did you try running collectstatic with ignoring the original admin\u2013files?\npython manage.py collectstatic --ignore django.contrib.admin\n. @sdillinger well, haven't been able to reproduce this for 2+ years. I'm pretty sure this is not related to grappelli but your server/django setup.\n. @myii Thanks a lot for the research and the very detailed explanation. What you're saying makes sense indeed (still funny that I've never run across this issue with any projects we did).\n. see #791 . @BertrandBordage about the french locale: grappelli doesn\u00b4t include any translations (this all comes with django). the other changes look fine to me ... but why do you want to pull to master (instead of stable/2.4.x)?\n. about the translations: yes, you\u00b4re right \u2013 there are some strings not available with django.contrib.admin. on the other hand, adding translations means using transifex, managing that project et.al. ... but we rather concentrate on improving grappelli (not enough resources to do translations as well).\n. I\u00b4ve fixed the issue with id\u00b4s and autocompletes. we won\u00b4t add translations to grappelli and I\u00b4ve decided to not take action concerning the datepicker\u2013issue (waiting for a cleaner patch for that one). thanks!\n. what is django-autocomplete-light?\n. updated \u2013 please let me know if that works for you.\n. stable/x.x.x > release > master\n. @parsch: what do you think? IMO, we can\u00b4t support every 3rd\u2013party app (not until there\u00b4s an established Frontend\u2013Framework with consistent classes and styles with the vanilla admin theme). on the other hand, adding this one additional style is fine with me ...\n. thx. added to stable/3.4.x and fixed some missing urls.\n. @michaelmior no problem and thanks for the patch.\n. already fixed with stable/3.4.x\n. the \"releases\" section on github front (https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli) says 2.3.9 is the latest release for 2.3. \nthe latest release on pypi is 2.3.9 as well ...\nwhat do you mean with \"the Zip button to download an archive for the 2_3 branch\" ... can you give me a link/url?\n. now I see \u2013 you\u00b4re using the \"wrong\" branch. grappelli_2_3 is a dev branch, stable/2.3.x is the right one \u2013\u00a0besides, using pypi is always recommended.\n. you\u00b4re right \u2013 that should be more obvious. I\u00b4ll open a ticket.\n. done\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions. this is an issue tracker. thx.\nabout your question: it depends on what you mean with \"navigation\" ... grappelli.dashboard adds the ability to use a custom index dashboard (which needs to be defined, see the docs for that).\n. that navigation needs to be customized (we removed it with previous versions of grappelli).\n. well \u2013 I\u00b4d personally use a list (ul) and add it to the header\u2013area.\n. no, I don\u00b4t mind ... but the line you\u00b4re referring to is the same with the django admin interface. not sure what\u00b4s the problem here. do you have an idea?\n. closing this for now. please reopen with more details. thx.\n. first question: how can I reproduce this? my models are never sorted arbitrary.\nsecond: the point with a model\u2013list is to show models independent or their names. what if I want a different ordering? currently, I can order my models with giving them a different position ...\n. sorry, but I still don\u00b4t get it \u2013 can you tell me how I\u00b4m able to reproduce this issue? my models are never being sorted randomly but based on their position.\n. I mean the position within the tuple:\nmodels=('django.contrib.auth.models.User', 'django.contrib.auth.models.Group'),\ninstead of:\nmodels=('django.contrib.*',),\nIMO, that\u00b4s the point of using a modellist (otherwise, an applist is probably better).\n. is this still an issue?\n. @phretor that\u00b4s strange. I just checked again and both your examples work fine with my setup. are you sure your models are references with e.g. \"academic.publishing.ConferenceArticle\" instead of something like \"academic.publishing.models.ConferenceArticle\"? whatever reason, this should definitely work (and it always has with my projects).\n. When looking at the code at bitbucket, I think you should use academic.publishing.models.ConferenceArticle ... any reason you don\u00b4t use \"models\"?\nWhen you check admin.py, you see that the models are imported with\nfrom academic.publishing.models import *\n. @phretor yeah!\n. guess that issue is solved, right? please reopen or add a new issue if you\u00b4re still having problems with sorting models \u2013\u00a0it should work tas explained by phretor above.\n. should already be solved with stable/2.4.x ... new release on pypi coming soon.\n. already solved with stable/3.4.x ... release coming soon.\n. are you sure the styles/templates are properly loaded? because I\u00b4m not able to reproduce that screenshot with IE9 ... that\u00b4s IE8, right?\n. @lvelezsantos what \"problems mentioned above\"? kenricci (who opened the ticket) obviously solved the problem and it was some kind of setup\u2013issue (or mis\u2013installation). so, there\u00b4s nothing we can actually refer to.\n. please add a new ticket with a more detailed description if the problem still exists.\n. I\u00b4ve added your code to stable/2.4.x, though we\u00b4re now having an issue with autocomplete\u2013lookups if nothing is found. I\u00b4ll check that.\n. @BertrandBordage Sorry, I\u00b4m trying to rephrase. I need to know if any of the methods you defined is important for overriding stuff (either for you, personally, or based on your idea of how the classes should work on a purely theoretical level). Let\u00b4s take \"model_in_GET\" ... needed for a specific reason or just a personal decision? Could we distinguish between helper\u2013methods (e.g. model_in_GET) and methods which could/should be overriden (e.g. get_queryset)? IMO, something like public/private functions would help for naming the methods and clarify the behaviour. Do you know what I mean?\nBesides, FILTER and SEARCH is not being splitted with autocompletes (filter is part of get_queryset) ... any reason that filter is not a separate method?\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. @parsch can you take a look at this one?\n. supporting django-mptt is definitely planned, but I need to take a closer look at the possible issues. supporting FeinCMS is not planned though.\n. I\u00b4ve been taking a look at django\u2013mptt. Integration with Grappelli is easy (we just need to add 2 simple templates), but it\u00b4ll never look nice because of this:\nhttps://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/blob/master/mptt/templatetags/mptt_admin.py#L102\nhardcoded margin with python-code. WTF!\n. there should be a class instead of the hardcoded padding. if the guys over at django\u2013mptt will change this, integration with grappelli is easy.\n. Here\u00b4s a workaround: see https://gist.github.com/4452240\nI\u00b4m closing this ticket for now. If the guys doing django\u2013mptt will remove the paddings from python code, we\u00b4ll support mptt.\n. did you check the tinymce setup? did you add/remove valid elements to show the player?\nplease refer to the tinymce docs in order to resolve this issue. I\u00b4m pretty sure it\u00b4s not related to grappelli ... feel free to reopen this ticket (with additional information) if you think it\u00b4s a grappelli\u2013related bug.\n. change the background with css\nadd a logo with using a custom header\noverriding grappelli\u2013templates works exactly like overriding django\u2013templates (of course, it depends on the position of your template\u2013loaders).\n. which version of grappelli are you using?\n. thx, I\u00b4ll look into that.\n. Thanks \u2013 that looks good. Any reason you wanna merge to master instead of stable/2.4.x?\n. Sorry for being so skeptical, but what are all these commits? Is it possible you\u00b4re just sending your own changes? Otherwise I can still cherry\u2013pick your updates ...\n. awesome \u2013 thx a lot.\n. that\u00b4s already solved ... see stable/2.4.x\n. Thanks for the effort, but we don\u00b4t support translations with grappelli (if we do, we need to use Transifex and that\u00b4s just too much work for a couple of translatable lines). Another reason we don\u00b4t add TinyMCE language files is that we plan to use another editor as soon as possible ... sorry!\n. Where did you find translations?\nI personally would like to switch to Redactor, but the editor still produces strange HTML. I never liked CKEditor, but the current theme looks really nice. Main problem is: With every update of TinyMCE, we need to update all the plugins because of the look & feel.\n. Alright \u2013 I forgot that we have these translations. In that case, I\u00b4m going to add your translations (of course). Though it\u00b4d be helpful if you patch against stable/2.4.x (not master).\nUnfortunately, Redactor currently just looks impressive \u2013 but it behaves pretty annoying.\n. Yes. The only problem I see is when the changelist is paginated. How would you solve that? How can I move an item from page 2 to page 1?\n. IMO we should not add a feature if it doesn\u00b4t fully work. I can already hear clients calling asking how to reorder with pagination activated. However, I do like the feature and if we find a decent solution, I\u00b4m definitely +1. From my point of view, the limitation is serious since you\u00b4re not able to re\u2013position an element from one page to another ...\n. I just realized there\u00b4s a setting list_max_show_all since Django 1.4 (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_max_show_all). I guess it only makes sense to reorder a manageable amount of items. And with the given option, one could still click on \"Show All\" in order to rearrange items which haven previously been on different pages.\nTherefore, I\u00b4m accepting a patch (please use stable/2.4.x for pull\u2013requests).\nBut the behaviour needs to be similar with inlines (no extra js with ModelAdmin).\n. @brejoc Are you working on this one? Otherwise, I'm going to close the ticket.\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. closing this since no useful explanation is given.\n. this is an issue tracker ... please use the google\u2013group for asking questions. thx.\n. you\u00b4re working with django 1.6 while django 1.5 is not yet released?\n. alright, I see. is your pull\u2013request backwards\u2013compatible?\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. how is this solved with the original admin interface? do they use get_short_name?\nand: please patch against stable/2.4.x (not master).\n. Thanks for looking into that.\n. that change is not backwards\u2013compatible with 1.4 ...\n. should be solved with stable/2.4.x\n. No, there currently isn\u00b4t (though it should be a matter of minutes setting up grappelli with an existing django project). However, we might add a live demo soon.\n. we decided that this is out of scope. besides, there's no need (at least not for us) to advertise the project.\n. I see your point ... but while you don't have the time to research the benefits, we don't have the time to setup and maintain a demo site (that said, I guess researching the benefits is less time-consuming).\n. Not sure about that one since it's fairly easy to use grappelli with an existing project. So you just need to setup a project and install grappelli.\nHowever, you could use the model available with grappelli/tests in order to work on this feature. If you send a PR I'm happy to review.\n. @doganmeh a grid-based look & feel is definitely not a standard feature (django doesn't care at all about the UI).\n. shouldn\u00b4t that be:\ntry:\n    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *\nexcept ImportError:\n    from django.conf.urls import *\notherwise, it\u00b4s backwards\u2013incompatible, right? \n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. say I\u00b4m using \"name__icontains\" for my autocomplete lookups and I\u00b4m having numerous db\u2013rows with the same name ... why should I only see \"distinct\" values?\n. thx. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. Thanks for pointing this out. Mobile is definitely in discussion, though part of a bigger strategy on how we\u00b4ll develop Grappelli in the future. Currently we\u00b4re trying to fix as many limitations (caused by the original admin interface) as possible with Grappelli. However, this is tedious and time\u2013consuming.\nOur idea is to implement a frontend framework with the admin interface based on a fixed and updated foundation (talking about django.contrib.admin). Once the main issues are solved, we can get rid of all workarounds and invest more time for important issues like mobile browsers. Until then, we don\u00b4t have the ressources to do that work.\nThat being said, we do accept patches ... \n. thanks \u2013 we\u00b4ll take a look.\n. see #274\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x ... somehow it seems that GitHub doesn\u00b4t accept commits with \"fixed #xxx\" anymore.\n. that needs to be added to model_list as well, right?\n. in order to reproduce this \u2013\u00a0where do I actually add the code you\u00b4ve mentioned above? models, admin, ...?\n. just tested \u2013 IMO the trans templatetag should also be used with model.title (with app_list) and child.title (with model_list). otherwise, there\u00b4s no translation. on the other hand, I might not fully understand what you\u00b4re actually trying to translate (app title, model title, both)?\n. there\u00b4s a difference: with using the dashboard, you can easily translate the app\u2013name with the dashboard title (which is not possible when using the standard template). so I\u00b4m not sure this change has any benefits ... does it?\nbesides, when translating the app\u2013name with the dashboard template, why not also translate the model names?\n. Now I\u00b4ve got it \u2013 sorry! And thanks for the explanation.\n. @parsch fixed?\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. you\u00b4re talking about a textfield (not a foreign key), right?\nbesides \u2013 why are you using mark_safe? this could obviously break the layout depending on the content of your textfield.\n. @parsch any idea?\n. did you check stable/2.4.x ... isn\u00b4t that already solved?\nsecond question: that\u00b4s a non\u2013backwards compatible change, right? so this is related to django 1.6?\n. there should be a button \"X\" on the right\u2013hand side of each row (the checkbox is hidden). do you have the permissions to delete the items?\n. what do you mean with \"delete the row\"? what if you just made a mistake (e.g. clicking the wrong row)?\n. 1. let\u00b4s say you hide the row (but that was a mistake). what do you do? reload the page?\n2. hiding the row suggests that the record is being deleted immediately (and that you don\u00b4t need to press \"save\").\n. you\u00b4re kidding, right?\n. @parsch what do you think? I\u00b4d go with the current solution and I don\u00b4t see the need to change this.\n. closing this for now. IMO the proposed solution has no benefits.\n. please send your model (the relevant part) and the admin definition. thx.\n. There\u00b4s not attribute columns with the Dashboard (see the grappelli docs for more details). Use the attribute columns with the dashboard\u2013module.\n. since grappelli is only a skin, that\u00b4s more of a django issue, right?\n. Alright, closing this for now.\n. @parsch you might want to look at this. I personally don\u00b4t like using the resize\u2013icon for showing the pagebreak.\n. what exactly is the usecase for text\u2013align and font\u2013colors? this is better done with using classes, isn\u00b4t it? I know we could just add this ... on the other hand, I don\u00b4t think there\u00b4s a good reason these buttons should ever (ever!) be present with a text editor.\nhowever, I\u00b4m open to conviction.\n. see #214\n. thx. could you patch against stable/2.4.x or is it too complicated? otherwise I\u00b4m trying to cherry\u2013pick your changes.\n. I might be missing something, but what exactly is the \"problem\" you\u00b4ve mentioned? Using an integer field for an ID is the way to go, right? Should we change the docs?\n. @paramburu yes, you are right \u2013\u00a0we\u00b4ll take a look.\n@parsch might be easy to solve with adding input.vTextField and textarea.vLargeTextField to the fields we need to hide via css.\n. seems to work with charfields, does not work with textareas.\n. @parsch works now, but after selecting an item from a pop\u2013up the screen jumps to top ... with fk and m2m as well. this didn\u00b4t happen before.\n. works for me. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. thanks, but that\u00b4s the totally wrong branch. please user either stable/2.4.x or master.\n. fixed in stable/2.4.x\n. thx, good point. with the \"new version of Django\" you\u00b4re referring to what exactly? upcoming 1.5 or 1.6 (dev)?\n. How exactly is this related to Grappelli?\n. @Hedde it has to be the other way round \u2013\u00a0FeinCMS needs to be based on Grappelli if both apps should work nicely with each other.\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. Hard to say \u2013\u00a0I suggest using print\u2013statements with the related lookup view and/or the js, trying to find out why the app_label and model_name is missing. Looks weird and shouldn't happen.\n. just a guess \u2013 is it possible that the term \"condition\" causes the error. did you try to rename the field?\nbesides, could you send me the code to my email address (incl. models.py, admin.py)?\n. thanks for clarifying.\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. The google\u2013group ist a better place to ask questions. However, if this should happen it needs to be the other way round ... Django\u2013CMS has to be based on Grappelli, using the right classes and DOM (see Grappellis DOM docs).\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. thanks for the patch ... fixed with stable/2.4.x\n. already fixed.\n. which version of django, which version of grappelli? does it work with raw\u2013id\u2013fields?\n. ok, thanks \u2013\u00a0I'll take a look. if you have any additional info, please let me know.\n. just tested this and it works fine for me.\n. yes, just to be sure. and please add your admin config. besides, do you get any js errors?\n. did you try with grappelli 2.4.4 (the latest version)?\n. closing this since the last comment is 3 months old and additional information is missing.\n. already solved with stable/2.4.x\n. already solved with stable/2.4.x \u2013\u00a0we'll release a new version soon.\n. if we look at djangos setup.py it should be:\n'Programming Language :: Python',\n'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.6',\n'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7',\n'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.2',\n'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.3',\nright?\n. already committed. thanks for the hint.\n. please reopen with a useful description of the problem \u2013 you\u00b4re saying that \"grappelli is not compatible with django 1.5\", but that\u00b4s wrong. please add comprehensible details. thank you!\n. it seems that you didn\u00b4t follow the installation steps:\nhttps://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/2.4.4/quickstart.html\nthere\u00b4s definitely no bug here! please use the grappelli google\u2013group for asking questions ... thanks!\n. you are right \u2013\u00a0we didn\u00b4t yet find a way to translate the datepicker.\n. the django datepicker is extremely hard to style and we're using jqueryUI anway. that being said, it should (theoretically) be possible to get the defined language and change the datepickers language \u2013 it's definitely possible with using a custom base template.\nI'm sorry ... I know this is not a satisfying answer. but it's already a lot of work dealing with all the strange code of the original interface.\n. the same is true for autocomplete generic lookups when content_type is defined with radio_fields ... right?\n. fixed with stable/2.4.x (merged to master)\n. sorry, but grappelli\u2013safe is not developed or maintained by us ... I guess you need to talk to the people doing mezzanine.\n. the .editorconfig looks good to me although I'd go with spaces (instead of tabs) for scss\u2013files as well \u2014 I just did a quick check and could not find any files with tabs ...\na pull request is very much appreciated.\n. I'm sorry, but I'm not able to merge this pull\u2013request ... \n. it's a merging issue because of the updates we made recently.\n. usually it's the latest development branch we're using (e.g. stable/2.4.x), but currently you can use master since everything's merged.\n. did you send the new pull\u2013request?\n. closing this for now, since there doesn't seem to be a usable pull\u2013request. please open a new issue if you're working on this one.\n. @jaap3 thanks for the heads up. I'll take a look and let you know if it works (or not).\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions. thank you.\n. Is that also the case with Django 1.5 or only with django\u2013master (because we only support official django releases).\n. please use the google\u2013groups for asking questions. If you think this is a bug with grappelli, please reopen the ticket with a detailed explanation on what's wrong. thx.\n. @BertrandBordage it works fine with our testcases and the class should be there (see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/static/grappelli/js/jquery.grp_related_fk.js#L22). are you sure you're having the right version installed?\n. thx. I've removed the URLs and changed the hosting mode.\n. I guess there's something wrong with your setup on the position\u2013field, because I'm not able to reproduce this. can you send your models and modeladmins?\n. closing this \u2013 please reopen with detailed information if you think this is a bug.\n. good point.\n. looking at the code (at github) there does not seem to be any .DS_store files ... ???\n. so how do I remove these files then?\n. tinymce does not include that css\u2013file, so we'll remove it from the template.\n. why do you add a template to /admin/constance/ instead of /constance/ ... that looks a bit strange to me ... ???\n. I see ... not a good idea to put the templates there, but not much we can do about that I guess. will merge soon. thanks for the pull\u2013request.\n. @hellysmile just checked your template and it does not seem to follow the way grappelli templates are built ... I'm trying to fix this (but it might take a while).\n. Why don't you add related_label to the model containing the ContentType reference?\n. Your PageObject does not have a name nor an app_label, therefore\nreturn force_text(\"%s:%s\" % (self.name, self.app_label))\ndoes not return anything ... \n. Did you try to debug in order to see what exactly is happening? I assume you need to use content_object (or content, in your case), but I didn\u00b4t test that obviously.\n. There might be a misunderstanding: related_label refers to how selected items are being displayed (e.g. within an autocomplete\u2013field or a raw\u2013id\u2013field). It does not refer to the content\u2013type dropdown (changing that dropdown is not related to grappelli).\n. what exactly do you mean? activating the admin for related lookups?\n. generally speaking, we don't duplicate the django\u2013docs. this is needed for the original admin to work (not only for grappelli), so I'm not sure we should add this ... we have to assume people now how to deal with the original admin when using grappelli.\n. I see your point ... however, it's stated clearly with the docs that autocompletes are an alternative for related lookups. And you need to register both models with every kind of relationship when using django.contrib.admin.\nThat being said, I'll add a short note with the docs.\n. Did you add the module to your Dashboard?\n. yes, you should do that \u2013\u00a0it's in the docs (see grappelli.dashboard).\n. I though you closed it ... I just closed the ticket ... ???\n. I see \u2013 thanks for the pull\u2013request (reopened).\n. that's a backwards\u2013incompatible change with django 1.6, right?\n. Thanks. We won't fix this with the upcoming release (since we only support official releases of Django). However, if someone adds a backwards\u2013compatible patch, I'm fine with implementing this.\n. that should already be solved, see\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/templates/admin/edit_inline/stacked.html#L45\nIf you still see this issue, please reopen the ticket.\n. @BertrandBordage That's a good point. I personally don't see inlines \"moving\", but that's probably because my admin pages are loading pretty fast. Theoretically speaking, I like the suggested solution because we get rid of the JS. But I'm not sure about the actual implementation with something like fieldsets_and_inlines_order = ('f', 'i', 'i') ...  it's just not obvious what happens and which 'i' I'm referring to. Any ideas on how this could be improved?\n. are you interested in updating your patch in order to support a more verbose kind of rearrangement?\nI'm thinking about something like this:\n(\"Some Fieldset\", {\n    \"classes\": (\"grp-collapse grp-open\",),\n    \"fields\": (\"whatever\",)\n}),\n(\"Image Inlines\", {\"inline\": \"ImagesInline\"),\n(\"Another Fieldset\", {\n    \"classes\": (\"grp-collapse grp-open\",),\n    \"fields\": (\"whatever\",)\n}),\n. There is an example with the docs. You need a class placeholder and a 2nd class which matches the class of the inline-group (which depends on your fieldsets). If you have an inline images the class would probably be images-group.\nBesides, please use the google-group for asking questions (it\u00b4s more likely to get an answer there).. http://skin.tinymce.com\n. you need to use the grp\u2013prefix, so it's e.g. grp-collapse ... but please use the google-group for asking questions.\n. grappelli respects limit_choices_to which works fine with our testcases. if you think there's a bug, please reopen this ticket with additional details (models, ModelAdmin ... grappelli/django version etc etc). if this is a question (I'm actually not sure about it), please use the google\u2013group.\n. I'm sorry if I'm not able to follow ... so we're not talking about limit_choices_to but only queryset, right?\n. I'm +1 on fixing this \u2013 can you support an example (models.py, ModelAdmin, ...)?\n. Nope ... code snippets are fine (just to get the basic idea in order to construct a testcase). As simple as possible!\n. alright, thanks a lot. What I tried is to restrict the class RelateLookup (line 51), because this is what AutocompleteLookup relies on, but it does not seem to work. Will dig in deeper tomorrow (time to go to bed around here).\n. I'm actually not sure how to solve this. Theoretically speaking, we need to check for a method queryset, defined with ModelAdmin. Therefore, we have to find the registered ModelAdmin first ... and in order to get the ModelAdmin, we need to know which AdminSite we're currently using (because we cannot assume the model is registered with django.contrib.admin).\n1. Find current AdminSite\n2. check _registry for the model\n3. This gives us the correct ModelAdmin\n4. check if queryset is defined (if not, use the default manager)\nAny help is appreciated.\n. This should work ... the only issue left is figuring out the current AdminSite ...\ntry:\n    # See if there is a custom admin queryset\n    return admin_site._registry[self.model].queryset(self.request)\nexcept:\n    # If not, go with the default manager\n    return self.model._default_manager.all()\n. @rcooke with my testcase, if I'm using model.queryset(request) it does not work ... because model has no idea about ModelAdmin (but the custom queryset is defined with ModelAdmin). Besides, ModelAdmin is registered with a specific admin site (not necessarily django.contrib.admin) and that's why I try to get the current admin site. Are your sure that model.queryset(request works with your setup? I'm really surprised about that ...\n. IMO, we cannot assume people use the default admin site. I think the only way to find out which is the current admin site is via URLs ... and it shouldn't matter if a model is registered with several sites (because each ModelAdmin could have a different custom queryset). From my point of view, the second problem is exactly the same as the first one. Once we have the current admin site, we also have the right queryset.\n. That's what I'm talking about ... we need to check the URL (request.path) and the admin site associated with that specific URL (no GET parameters involved here). Unfortunately, with current_app (see django.contrib.admin), we only get the name of the admin site.\n. Question is, how do we get this list of admin sites ... because I didn't find a way except manually adding a list of admin sites to settings (which is not a good solution).\n. @rcooke are you still working on this issue?\n. see #403 \n. @rockymeza sorry ... thought this is backwards\u2013incompatible.\n. Sorry, but I'm not able to follow that pull request. Your 2nd paragraph says \"The \"<\" character shouldn't ever be in the label\" ... to me, that sounds like you're seeing an \"<\" character, but it doesn't show up on your screenshots. Am I missing something?\n. now I see \u2013 thanks for the clarification. I'll update later today.\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions. this is an issue tracker! thanks.\n. my thoughts on the mentioned ideas:\n- replacing icons with a decent webfont is a good idea\n- concerning the dashboard: we'll probably change the header\u2013area a bit with the next major release of grappelli. so your dashboard screenshot is something we currently cannot consider.\n- notifications etc: see previous. we should add the styles for adding this, but we definitely won't add the actual implementation.\n- sidebar: the alternate sidebar should already be possible with the current grappelli\u2013styles.\n- changelist: not sure what this screenshot should tell us \u2013 looks like a standard changelist to me.\n- +1 for adding tabs.\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions! this is an ISSUE TRACKER!!!\n. please check the contribution guidelines and reopen the issue \u2013\u00a0thanks.\n. thanks for the patch \u2013\u00a0looks good to me. can you add another usecase besides the one mentioned? because I'm not sure if we should add this if it only covers this (very rare) case.\n. alright \u2013\u00a0I'm currently +1, but let me think about this for another day ;-)\n. let's do this. a pull\u2013request is highly appreciated (including documentation updates).\n. @arski There's gonna be another grappelli\u2013release pretty soon (just some minor fixes). If you send a pull\u2013request, I'll add it to the release.\n. thanks for the patch. IMO this should be done with overriding the template (see django\u2013docs on how to customize admin templates), because we just can't support every single usecase and overriding templates is an easy and straightforward solution. \n. any idea on how to make that update backwards compatible?\n. that\u00b4s fine, thanks.\n. smart_bytes is not available with django1.4\n. That was just a reminder for myself to update the grappelli docs, saying that at least django 1.4.2 is required. Since we have supported Django 1.4+ so far, I need to mention that. But of course you are right that 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 should not be used anymore.\n. @parsch clicking on a datepicker throws a 404:\n\"NetworkError: 404 NOT FOUND - .../static/grappelli/jquery/ui/css/custom-theme/images/ui-bg_glass_0_CEE9F2_1x400.png\"\n. Thx for the pull\u2013request. When using this code I'm getting Invalid filter: 'admin_urlquote' ... which version of django did you use?\n. see #395\n. that has already been solved with 2.4.7.\nbesides, your pull\u2013request misses the stacked inlines.\nplease reopen this ticket if I'm wrong ...\n. did you test without grappelli? because that js comes with django. \n. hi bryan,\nunfortunately, that image you posted is not visible \u2013 I'm getting a 404.\nregards,\npatrick\n. that\u00b4s strange. just a guess: if you add an app with INSTALLED_APPS, did you add exactly the same path with your dashboard and your admin registration? e.g., you could have www.blog with INSTALLED_APPS and you could just add blog when you register your admin model and you could again add www.blog with the dashboard ... that might not work.\n. you do have the necessary permissions for music, right?\nyou could try this (just to see if it is working):\nmodels=('components.merchandise.music.models.XXX',),\nother than that, I really don't have an idea \u2013\u00a0I usually use the exact same code. of course, you could try to debug with dashboard.modules.AppList (a simple print statement should be sufficient).\n. @bryanveloso ok, so I did a couple of tests with either AppList and ModelList \u2014 it doesn't matter if I use several single models or if I use components.merchandise.* or components.merchandise.music.*, it all works. the only issue I had is when the app added with dashboard is named differently than with INSTALLED_APP \u2014 other than that I haven't been able to reproduce this.\n. closing this for now \u2013 if you think this is a bug, please reopen with additional information.\n. Thanks for the pull\u2013request.\nI'm having a couple of issues here:\n1) If I add an Inline and then drag it to another position, TinyMCE seems to react strange (I'm not able to insert text anymore).\n2) When having an Inline with just a textarea and a position\u2013field, the position is not being updated, because line 245 of stacked.html (var fields=...) does not include TinyMCE.\nAny ideas how to solve this?\n. closing this since the PR is pretty old ... please add a new PR if you still work on this issue.\n. closing this, because the authority templates are quite a mess.\n. of course, using sessions does not work \u2013 instead we use the cache framework. because the key has to be the path to the current site, this is limited to showing one additional user, but I guess that's fine for now. seeing another user viewing/editing the site should be enough of a warning. we just want to make sure an editor knows about another editor currently online.\n. https://github.com/django/django/commit/389892aae595b86c4be28c43e3312d76a68a0173\n. @bryanveloso I've added a quick fix. But please note that grappelli is not yet compatible with Django 1.6 \u2014 there's a lot of backwards-incompatible changes (esp. with admin templates). Therefore, we need to do a new major release. Quickly looking through all the necessary changes, I doubt that this will happen within the next couple of weeks. \n. @bryanveloso yes \u2026 there's only two things you need to check: a) the new approach for defining \"view on site\" doesn't work with the current version of grappelli and b) preserve_filters doesn't work as well.\n. fixed with master\n. see #396 \n. @parsch please take a look at this one (needs to be styled).\n. @brenouchoa absolutely. coming today!\n. @dmrz thanks a lot for the pull\u2013request, but please use branch stable/2.5.x for everything related to Django 1.6.\n. @lzanuz thanks!\n. @lzanuz and \u2026 thanks again!\n. @lzanuz thanks \u2026 the template changes are already solved (see branch stable/2.5.x). concerning the widgets, I've opened a separate ticket.\n. all 1.6 compatibility issues should now be solved with branch stable/2.5.x (pypi release coming later today)\n. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/widgets/#numberinput\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/widgets/#emailinput\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/widgets/#urlinput\n. @parsch moreover, with a changelist and list\u2013editables, the URLField is wrapped with p.url which adds margins at the top/bottom (these margins/paddings need to be removed).\n. @pnovotnak because you mentioned mezzanine: please note that mezzanine relies on a pretty outdated version of grappelli and they are using a separate branch.\n. @tdruez there is no help_text with the django templates, is there?\n. I see \u2013 thanks for the clarification.\n. @rcooke filters are not handled by grappelli, but by django. we don't customise anything here.\n. @pauloxnet did you do any tests? does it work? can you add a testcase?\n. @pauloxnet I'm sorry, but I won't merge this without tests ... but thanks for the patch anyway.\n. how does that test relate to your pull-request? I think we need a modeladmin with a custom queryset, don't we? In my opinion, there needs to be a new (or at least extended) testcase.\nbesides, your pull-reqeust does not work if models are registered with several admin sites, does it? when you take a look at my first comment, you'll see that my proposal includes adding the model_admin to the ajax-call. that's because (in my opinion) we cannot rely on registry to provide us with the correct modeladmin.\n. a) yes, modeladmin has get_queryset but we don't have testcases for that option. that's exactly what I'm talking about ... we need tests to cover that option. of course, these tests are currently not necessary since we don't support custom querysets (but a pull-request should include the tests).\nb) just by looking at the code, I think your pull-request does not work with several admin sites ... but I'm not sure since we don't have a testcase.\n. see https://gist.github.com/sehmaschine/41747752e56e2723368a409feb3cbd5c\nthe changes are in lines 21, 76-81 and 96-98.\nIt\u00b4s actually a pretty easy workaround, but (in my opinion) it does not work with multiple/custom admin sites since we only check the contrib.admin registry. I'm not sure how we could solve this and I'm currently unable to add a testcase. As said before, if someone comes up with a working and tested solution, I'm more than happy to merge it.\n. sorry, but I'm not able to follow \u2026 what exactly is the bug/issue?\n. should it? if yes, why?\nI still don't see what the bug/issue is \u2026 is this limited to your personal/custom usecase or valid for anybody?\n. let me put it this way: why do you use an onclick attribute anyway? isn't it better to use something like .bind(\"click\", \u2026).\n. hmm, alright \u2013 since it won't break anything I'll update. thanks for reporting.\n. grappelli 2.4.8 (compatible with django 1.5) does not include firstof from future, grappelli 2.5.0 (compatible with django 1.6) does.\n. that\u00b4s another issue now, right? could you please open a new ticket?\nthe README doesn\u00b4t need to be updated since grappelli 2.4.8 is supposed to work with django 1.4 and 1.5.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue. {% now \"Z\" %} should work with django 1.4/1.5 and 1.6, although django only uses it with the admin interface from 1.7 \u2026 however, this should not throw an error.\nare you able to add any details?\n. @foxx alright, thanks for clarifying.\n. sorry, but I'm not able to follow \u2026 what exactly is the bug?\nwe have recently updated jquery/jquery-ui but decided to keep the old files (js, css) because people might have used these files for customizations.\n. now I see \u2013 thanks for clarifying. that's a bug indeed.\n. what exactly is the \"improvement\"?\nI didn't check order_with_respect_to for quite a while, but it has been there from the very beginning \u2013 but it actually never worked correctly (or at least the way it's supposed to work). Besides, you can just use \"_order\" as your sortable_field \u2026 so I'm not sure what exactly we should change with grappelli.\nI'm closing this because of the missing details. That being said, it might still be a good idea \u2013 but maybe I'm just not understanding it right now. So please feel free to reopen this ticket with additional explanations.\n. what do you mean with \"under the search button\"?\n. same problem as #411 \n. @lzanuz From my point of view, what you\u00b4re saying is only true when applying more than one filter. With a single filter applied, the current version is faster (because you only need one click instead of an additional submit-button). Therefore, I'm not sure if your suggestion improves the overall usability. \n. it seems that you don't have a request defined with your context \u2026 is that possible? can you try to debug and check why line 219 with grp_tags throws an error?\n. and \u2026 did you run the tests?\n. can you check why there's no request\u2013var?\n. just to get this right \u2014 everything besides SWITCH_USER does work, right?\n. please add an example (code!) to your proposal. thanks.\n. it should be possible to overwrite the jQuery function (I guess). and I think that\u00b4s a much better solution, because we can't add blocks to everything. IMO that usecase is too personal to change the code \u2026 but I might rethink the issue if overwriting the js\u2013functions doesn\u00b4t work.\n. what you're experiencing here is exactly what @parsch described \u2026 it does not make sense to add the block to every stacked inline. therefore, we decided to not implement this. if you find another solution which works for single inlines, please feel free to reopen this ticket.\n. the policy depends on the version of the docs \u2013 with a new version (e.g. 2.5.x) previous updates are only mentioned with the major version. as far as I know, that's how Django does it as well \u2026 if I'm wrong, please feel free to reopen this ticket.\n. there have been changes with jquery handling _renderItem \u2026 maybe we've missed something, but it works with my testcases (multiple autocompletes as well). \nyou might wanna try this one:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9513251/cannot-set-property-renderitem-of-undefined-jquery-ui-autocomplete-with-html\nwhen looking on our code (e.g. jquery.grp_autocomplete_fk.js, line 114) it looks strange indeed. we first use .data(\"ui-autocomplete\") and later on .data( \"item.autocomplete\", item ) ...\n. did you check all staticfiles are loaded correctly (eg the new versions of jquery & jqueryui)? \n. Please use the Google\u2013Group for asking questions. If you think this is a bug, please add specific details. Thank you!\n. +1 if this is a replacement (or add-on) for drag/drop. If one needs to resort with manually editing positions, every number (position) should be possible (not only negative numbers). On the other hand, it might be confusing when an item jumps to another position.\nI have the feeling that this usecase is better solved with a custom js (or maybe with overriding the models save-method and rearranging the items).\nFeel free to reopen the ticket ...\n. Can't open the screenshot \u2026 is it the same as #405 \u2026 ?\nBesides, you did not mention which version of Grappelli you're using.\n. Alright, so that's actually solved already.\n. yes, it's marked as closed with a commit \u2026 isn't it solved?\n. I see \u2014 2.5.1 will probably be released early next week.\n. that\u00b4s already solved with stable/2.5.x\n. you only fix line 135 with your patch \u2014 but you're suggesting to fix line 63 as well, right?\n. we decided to delete the outdated jquery files instead of adding the images. thanks for the patch.\n. which version of django & grappelli?\n. that should be solved with branch stable 2.5.x \u2026 any chance you can give that a try?\n. sorry, you are right \u2013 this issue is not yet solved!\n. that\u00b4s not a grappelli issue: seems that your staticfiles are not loaded correctly (or maybe collectstatic didn\u00b4t work as expected). I'm pretty sure this is similar to #214 \u2026 if I missed something, please reopen this ticket with additional information (js-errors, debug statemenets etc.).\n. do you use grappelli.dashboard or not?\n. that\u00b4s two different issues in my opinion: we could update index.html in order to work with adminplus (a patch would be nice).\non the other hand, I'm not sure we should add adminplus with grappelli.dashboard \u2013 because you can easily add links (or even custom views) with a dashboard. so that doesn't make sense from my point of view \u2026\nbefore we change the code someone should test with and without the dashboard.\n. the whole point of the custom dashboard is to not show anything automatically.\n. absolutely: can you test adding adminplus to the dashboard?\n. I mean adding the custom views to a custom dashboard (with grappelli.dashboard) \u2014 what you proposed before with \"semi-automatically\".\n. there\u00b4s no sidebar block, but that\u00b4s not the point IMO. why do you believe code changes are necessary? context should include the custom list and you should be able to loop the items \u2026 well, you might need to dive into dashboards a bit.\n. I'm pretty sure any app using a custom index page will fail with grappelli, because our template structure differs \u2026 no matter if we add a sidebar block or not.\n. Your patch is fine, because you are using the grp-classes (e.g. grp-module).\nIf we just add a sidebar-block and another 3rd-party app extends that block without the grp-classes, there's no compatibility in the first place. That being said, I'm ok with adding that block \u2013 because most of the time, people probably use the custom dashboard anyway.\n. that template you mention hopefully doesn't work with grappelli \u2014 inline-styles, tables \u2026 wow!!!\n. the patch should work \u2013 I'll check that (probably next week).\n. you mean using Bootstrap instead of a custom theme?\n. we won\u00b4t using bootstrap for a couple of reasons (we discussed that already \u2013 see issues and google-group for details).\n. that\u00b4s because django-import-export uses another dom-structure for their templates. you need to overwrite their template with grappellis dom.\n. Please take a look at the django docs \u2013 there it\u00b4s explained how to overwrite templates.\n. thx \u2013 looks good to me.\n. @funkybob just a thought: isn't it better to use the ModelAdmins get_queryset method instead of providing a specific model manager?\n. see #403 \u2026 we need to add the modeladmin to the lookup call.\n. @rcooke did you take a look at the code with issue #403?\n. closing this in favour of #403 \n. sorry, but I do not understand this issue \u2026 why would wou want to hide the related lookup when you just defined it with your modeladmin?\n. I'm closing this since it does not seem to be an \"issue\" (please use the google group for asking questions). Feel free to reopen the ticket if I missed something.\n. good point. except keyerror should be nested (I don\u00b4t like the nesting as well, but it works).\nconsidering the queryset: what if we return qs = model.objects.none() if no search_fields are defined? of course, this leads to \"0 results\" with the autocomplete instead of an error message. but from my point of view, that\u00b4s ok. what do you think?\n. @titovanton-com what exactly is the issue here? you don\u00b4t need to set extra to zero in order to work with sortable inlines \u2026 that\u00b4s definitely working. please add more details if you think it\u00b4s a bug.\n. ok \u2013 so there are 2 issues: first, please open a new ticket for change list sortables. second, please add details about the actual bug you\u00b4re talking about \u2013 what you\u00b4re saying is currently not reproducable. I'm closing this for now since there are mixed issues here.\nbesides, please take a look at the contribution guidelines. thanks!\n. instead of changing the management command, I decided to add a note to the docs \u2026 since the location depends on where manage.py is being stored (related to your project directory).\n. @pauloxnet what exactly do you mean with filter/exclude? is this related to #403?\n. I see. that\u00b4s exactly #403, right? because this behaviour should also apply to related lookups (using the search icon, for example).\n. I'm closing this in favour of #403. If you think it\u00b4s a different issue, please reopen this ticket with an additional explanation.\n. you need to define autocomplets with your ModelAdmin, see http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#autocomplete-lookups\nbesides, please use the google group for asking questions \u2026 this is an issue tracker.\n. it does work with the changelist \u2026 did you try?\n. please resend the code in a readable format.\n. uncomment list_editable \u2014 because you want to edit the field, right?\n. yes, it is a requirement \u2026\nyou did not overwrite anything (css, templates)?\ncan you send a screenshot of your changelist?\nany js errors?\n. jquery.min.map is not part of grappelli \u2026 the question is: why is this file being loaded with your setup?\n. Sorry \u2013 I don\u00b4t have time to offer that kind of support. Please try to find out what\u00b4s the issue \u2026 autocompletes are definitely working on the changelist (I just douple-checked with different browsers).\nI'm closing this ticket for now. If you find something, feel free to reopen.\n. I don\u00b4t think the python-package is an issue (I might be wrong though).\nWhat I would do:\n1. check if raw_id_fields are working with your changelist (that\u00b4s pure django, not related to grappelli).\n2. check if related-lookups (grappelli) are working.\nI would use Firefox or Safari for testing. And always check for js-errors.\n. seems to be a django issue, right? how is this related to grappelli?\n. please use the google\u2013group for asking questions (see contribution guidelines). thank you!\n. I'm not able to reproduce this \u2013 please add the necessary details (see contribution guidelines).\n. @gone https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst\nan example app probably won\u00b4t help, since this \"issue\" does not exist (I\u00b4m pretty sure about that). so, the question is: why does it exist with your setup? I guess that the grappelli staticfiles are not served correctly.\n. @gone the behaviour with grappelli isn\u00b4t any different from the django admin, right? does it make sense to update the docs if there\u00b4s already an explanation with the django docs?\n. @jschneier no timeline. if you wanna submit a patch, I'll merge it asap.\n. I'm still not able to reproduce this, so I'm closing this issue. Please reopen with additional details about TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID. According to the django docs, you should not assume the admin templates to be rendered correctly, if TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID is set to anything other than an empty string.\n. what I don\u00b4t get \u2026 you define 'fk': [['enterprise']],, but enterprise is not within list_display \u2026 am I missing something?\n. @ingodjango can you do me a favour and try to replace that line with\n.find(\"input[name^='\" + prefix + \"'][name$='-\" + this + \"']\")\nthere\u00b4s now an additional \"-\" with checking the name attribute.\nplease let me know if that works.\n. Thanks \u2013 I\u00b4ll change that and commit asap.\n. solved with branch stable/2.5.x \u2013 new release soon.\n. thanks for the patch. how can I reproduce this bug?\n. I'm not able to reproduce the bug ... every add-url ends with a slash and my autocomplete work fine with add pages \u2026 ???\n. @deleted the js you mentioned resolves the href-attribute given with a relation (it\u00b4s not resolving the URL). And I\u00b4m not able to find a link with an additional \"add\" ... how did you get that?\n. @deleted autocomplete uses the links given with a relation-field (fk, m2m, ...) \u2013 you should see these links with the source-code. in my opinion, a relation-field always uses /appname/modelname/ and never ends with an /add/. the question remains: how can I reproduce this?\n. alright \u2013 I'm closing this for now. please reopen with details on how to reproduce this issue \u2013 no github repo needed, just simple infos like \"go to an add view\", \"use fk-autocomplete\" etc.\n. that's a good idea \u2013 thanks for the patch.\n. @blueyed is there an issue with the original template/styles or is it just with your custom template/styles?\n. fixed with stable/2.5.x\n. @MDamien no \u2013 master does not support 1.7 (if it works with 1.7, that\u00b4s not intended). if you need a branch in order to sumit patches for 1.7, please let me know.\n. @blueyed are these changes backwards-compatible?\n. @blueyed the branch is dev/2.6.x ... I don't think it makes sense to jump from 2.5 to 2.7 just because of the django version.\n. @HiddenFox grappelli 2.5.7 is NOT compatible with django 1.8.\n. @HiddenFox come on ... https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli#releases\n. it doesn\u00b4t make sense to patch against master, if it\u00b4s a backwards-incompatible change. this is only related to django 1.7, right?\n. @blueyed You're right \u2013 I assumed you wanna merge this right now.\n. master is always targeting the latest stable release (see docs). there are actually 2 stable branches for different django-versions \u2013 IMO, it\u00b4s hard to follow another one (and just too much effort for us).\nbesides, merging is always the better option ... but that probably requires another patch once we target django 1.7.\nthe plan is to release another version with bugfixes and then start working on 1.7 (in about 3-4 weeks hopefully).\n. @blueyed I'm not able to reproduce this error ... \n. @blueyed urls are being loaded. but I don\u00b4t understand how your next 2 questions are related to the topic ... in other words: what do I need to do in order to reproduce this error? do I need to use a custom user model?\n. still not able to reproduce this!\n. closing this since I've never been able to reproduce it ... please reopen with additional details if this error still exists.\n. I can't imagine a single request, but I'm open for ideas/patches. Besides, I only see one performance issue with what you describing (instead of two).\n. closing this since there's not been a pull-request so far\n. 1 \u2013 that's already the case: select via keyboard, enter does not submit the form.\n2 \u2013 you are talking about M2M-autocompletes, right?\n3 \u2013 again, this is only about M2M-autocompletes, right?\n. 2 & 3: I guess it\u00b4s a thin line between a visually minimal and clear interface and showing every option available. I tend to agree with your proposal ... on the other hand, we don\u00b4t wanna have a cluttered interface (thinking about a distinctive block for each item with an additional X is overdone IMO). But I see your point and we\u00b4ll discuss that.\n@parsch what\u00b4s your opinion?\n. you assume that the model is registered with admin.site ... but that's not necessarily true if we use a custom admin site ... right? so your patch only works with non custom sites, or do I miss something?\n. closing this since the PR is very old ... if you still work on this issue and have a good solution, please send a new PR.\n. what version of django/grappelli are you using? did you run the tests?\nbtw: I just tested this and it works fine for me. when looking at the code in grappelli.js, I don't see any potential bugs ... can you please add some details?\n. well ... as stated with the docs, autocomplete-fields need to be raw-id-fields ... ???\n. why do you think its insecure? the admin is only used by \"trusted editors\" anyway ... so having access to the admin itself is a much higher risk than adding the model structure, don't you agree?\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions ;-)\n. I don't agree that this is a security risk ... that being said, it's always better to limit the exposed information. So if you (or someone else) comes up with a patch, I'm happy to review that.\n. which section are you talking about? do you mean the page \"home\" when logging in at djangosuit/admin/?\n. besides \u2013 questions should usually be posted to the google-group, not the issue-tracker. that way, chances are much higher that other people read it and you might get an answer.\n. when is self.model = None? second, shouldn\u00b4t this exception be handled better than just using \"except\"?\n. thanks for the patch. the problem is that you are using styles which are not designed to fit your purpose (the success and error classes are for messages, not modules). besides, I'm not sure if this is better done with a custom view instead of a dashboard module (because the usecase is very rare in my opinion).\n. closing this for now since no further comment has been posted.\n. because your commit targets master and I'm working with the stable/... branches. not sure if it's possible to cherry-pick from another branch (I never did that).\n. ok \u2013 thanks for the hint (hub looks good).\n. you say that the form does not validate ... what exactly is the error you get? I'm ignoring the issue with prepoulated fields for now since that\u00b4s a different one (which we should take care of once the initial issue is solved).\n. wait ... just a guess: try to remove the default value for your ordering field or use sortable_exluces (see http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#sortable-excludes).\n. the sortable_exludes should refer to the position-field (not title or slug) \u2013 you want to exclude the field which has a value/default.\nsecond, are you sure you removed the default value (from the database)?\nif you have 3 fields within an extra-row and one field has a value (e.g. a default value), then we assume that this row needs to be saved (hence the error messages). if the row does not have any values, there won't be an error message. you could try check the js (adding some console logs) in order to exactly figure out what\u00b4s happening.\nplease post any (javascript) errors you find so we can reproduce this \u2013 because currently it's not reproducible and I'm pretty sure it is not a bug.\n. sortable_excludes is exactly what you described: combining default values with extra rows. because the js which defines the ordering field looks if there are values within each row \u2013 if so, a number is assigned. the fields within sortable_excludes are excluded from this calculation (you usually want to exclude all fields with default values).\nunfortunately, there is currently no other way since django doesn't tell us anything about the field values (e.g. giving us a json for each row).\nif that works, do you mind opening another ticket for the issue with the slug-field not being populated?\n. alright \u2013 I'm closing this for now. please reopen if the issue still exists with sortable_excludes.\n. which css-classes did you use for the collapsibles? besides, collapsibles also work with TabularInline (just the header, of course).\n. Not exactly ... the docs first mentions InlineModelAdmin (which includes both Stacked- and TabularInline). Additionaly, you have the inline_classes with StackedInline. The docs are fine from my point of view.\nWith the actual implementation, you need to use a tuple (or list), not a string. Second, inline_classes are only available with StackedInline (because there are no collapsible headers with Tabulars, so there's nothing which could actually be collapsed).\nWith Tabulars, you only need classes. I don't see a bug here \u2013 if you find one, please check the js for any errors and post it here.\n. I see your point concerning the documentation and we'll add additional examples for collapsible inline groups.\n. there are autocompletes with grappelli (see docs).\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions (this is an issue tracker).\n. thanks for the hint ... grappelli-filters looks useful indeed.\n. fixed with 300927fd7a207e556be87fa74125f48e02716570\n. please use the google-group for asking questions \u2013 if you think this is a bug, please add useful information in order to reproduce it. thank you!\n. fixed with dev/2.6.x\n. I see your point \u2013 on the other hand, these apps do add elements to the DOM which are not compatible with grappelli anway (e.g. admin-enhancers related links which are hardcoded images with a fixed width/height). So we solve one problem in order to face another one? Not sure about that ...\n. Agreed. We'll check if it's possible to add the original classnames as well (I'm pretty sure it is).\n. @blueyed is it only .form-row and #container we need?\n. @parsch what do you think about this issue? should we use the original ids/classnames as well? probably a good idea for compatibility reasons with other packages. on the other hand, if those packages rely on the original ids/classnames, they are probably not compatible with grappelli anyway. that said, blueyed mentioned that a non-optimal solution is better than none. I'd say it depends on a) how much work it is (maintenance included) and b) if it's going to be messy with all these different ids/classnames in the end.\n. We could also state that we do not add original classnames and any 3rd-party apps which target grappelli have to use our classes instead. That's (at least) a clear distinction (though I can see the drawbacks).\n. The Mixin is a good idea \u2013 will do some tests.\n. we still need to check this last commit because of hiding the row with stacked inlines \u2013 that's a bit complicated since django doesn't provide the information with the fieldline.\n. see fe0acf4db425a25264474ea8134661705c795f2e\n. did you try with a current checkout of dev/2.6.x?\n. will take a look at your approach. besides, master is not compatible with 1.7!\n. @adaptivdesign do you use the most recent version (there have been some commits yesterday).\n. I think using _to_field is the better approach, so I'll go with that one. thanks for looking into that!\n. fixed with f6f146ee51aa89f5e68179ab43588cba78de425c\n. I can see the function with grappelli.min.js ... ???\n. ah, thanks for clarifying. fixed with 6f58813fadac98720da96e3f63851d9ee987fe2a\n. should be solved with dev/2.6.x (not sure why you tried to merge with master). please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. thanks for the patch. one important issue with inlines is that the ordering is preserved in case of errors somewhere within the form (not necessarily with the inlines). did you check that with your patch? just by looking at the code, I don't think this will work.\n. closing this because no answer has been given.\n. For how, I'm not able to reproduce this. Reopen the ticket with additional details (if this is a bug indeed).\n. see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/docs/contributing.rst ... is that ok?\n. not a bad idea. the first contributing-file is automatically shown with github when adding an issue \u2013 the second one is part of the documentation. maybe we should integrate the whole \"how to add a ticket section\" with the docs and just link from the github-contrib-file to the documentation.\n. @SalahAdDin exactly like the original admin interface (we don't change anything about popups).\n. @SalahAdDin a) check the django code b) use the django google-group c) use the grappelli google-group. this is an issue tracker!\n. the branch which includes compatibility with django 1.7 is dev/2.6.x \u2013 can you try again with that one please?\n. this might be a stupid question, but did you test that? because I don't think that the grappelli settings are available as variables within a template.\n. Closing this as wontfix \u2013 if anyone uses django-smuggler, please add a pull-request.\n. yes\n. did you check that with our 1.7 compatible branch (dev/2.6.x)?\n. I'm not sure what you mean, but it's the same with djangos admin templates:\nhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/base_site.html\nPlease reopen with additional details, if you think this is a bug ... I currently don't see why it should be one.\n. @LegoStormtroopr you are right \u2013 thanks for checking that. @parsch can you take a look at that?\n. ... which versions (django/grappelli)? any custom js/templates?\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst\n. @dlcerva @volksman did you register the related object with the same admin-site? I'm not able to reproduce this (I only get a 404 if the related model is not registered).\n. maybe this is a django bug? https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23431\n. I'm not exactly sure why the \"_to_field\" is there in the first place, but it's used with the django admin as well (of course, there's no autocompletes). We could just remove it from the lookup query, but I don't know if that might lead to other issues.\n. @volksman thanks. I've used your patch (I didn't update related.py since one might have _to_field with custom templates) and minified the js. should be solved (hopefully).\n. we did not, since the issue has been closed ... the problem with the original ticket is that the versions don't match (grappelli 2.6.x is not compatible with django 1.6).\n. @soujiro86 IMO that's overdone. if we add the requirements to the setup-file, django is being updated if you install the wrong grappelli version. I think that the requirements are thoroughly listed in different places and it's fairly easy to update django yourself. any objections?\n. should already be fixed with the master branch. can you give that a try?\n. there is a binding for django.jQuery, see\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/static/grappelli/js/grappelli.js#L12\n. not sure if this is still an issue since no further comments have been made ... please reopen with additional details if you think this is a bug.\n. I see your point ... but why do you want to install grappelli.dashboard as well as admin_tools.dashboard?\n. updated with master (I hope that fix works).\n. fixed\n. sorry, but I don't understand what this is about. \n. looks good \u2013 I'll do some tests and merge this asap. thanks for the patch!\n. @mpasternak some issues here:\na) LANGUAGE_CODE is always set, isn't it? so the \"if LANGUAGE_CODE\" doesn't really make sense in my opinion.\nb) the default value for LANGUAGE_CODE is \"en-us\", but there's not datepicker language file with that ending. we'll always get a 404 with that one.\nc) if USE_I18N is False, the admin is not being translated. so we should check that setting as well, right?\n. sorry \u2013 just to get the idea right: you are not translating the datepicker with \"en-us\", but you try to translate the datepicker with every other language. did you check the compatibility between the django language codes and the datepicker files for other languages?\n. @mpasternak I've given this another try, but ... when you look at the django example with \"de_AT\" which is represented as \"de-at\" with the frontend, no such datepicker file exists which leads to a 404. Besides, the same is true with \"pt_BR\" (because the jquery UI file contains uppercase characters).\n. I prefer to have the locale files with grappelli \u2013 but only if we don't need to rename the files (because renaming makes every jQuery update more difficult than necessary).\n. I'm with @camilonova here, because there doesn't seem to be a clean solution. Stay with en and let people take care about translations (it's pretty easy anyway).\n. Closing this issue. please refer to #577 for the 500 ... other than that, we decided to not include the translation files because of the issues mentioned before. thanks everyone for participating and thanks for the thoughts/patches. I'm sorry that we are not able to include this ... but there doesn't seem to be a straightforward and maintainable solution.\n. no, it does not explain itself. first, please add versions (see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst). second, which content is not being loaded and why? are you sure this is a grappelli-issue?\n. did you try to navigate to a static-file directly (e.g. with adding the path to the browsers address bar)? if that doesn't work, it is not related to grappelli.\n. closing this since no further details are given. not a grappelli related issue in my opinion.\n. solved with stable/2.5.x\n. No\n. @volksman @funkybob yes, it should be the other way round in order to allow overriding the static files. I  can't remember why that's in the docs, so I'm going to remove it.\n. are you sure that the app-loading mechanism with haystack is fine?\nthe lookup error is correct in that it says \"grappelli doesn't have a dashboard model\", because it's actually the app \"grappelli.dashboard\" which has the model.\ncan you debug a bit more and try to find out what causes that error?\n. line 41 of haystack breaks with grappelli:\nhttps://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack/blob/master/haystack/utils/app_loading.py#L41\nI'm not sure why they are trying to call get_model here, but I guess that's a bug with haystack. If I'm not mistaken, haystack assumes that every installed app has a model, but that's not necessarily the case.\n. I suggest talking to the people doing haystack, because that problem might occur with other apps as well.\n. Closing this for now. Please note that we'll remove TinyMCE with the next major release.\n. you could add a custom js (overwrite the template). other than that, I don't see a solution. besides, I'm pretty sure that there are more issues when it comes to using grappelli with FeinCMS.\n. I would like to see that as well, but it's too much effort in my opinion.\n. that is a useful patch indeed. thanks!\n. @gkuhn1 one question: shouldn't change be triggered with M2Ms in case of removing values as well?\n. @epicserve just tested with a fresh setup (django 1.7, grappelli 2.6.3) and I'm not able to reproduce this. all autocompletes (fk, m2m, generic) look fine.\n. the length doesn't matter with my testcase. what browser are you using?\n. we're not on yosemite yet. can you do me a favour and just try with another browser (cause it might be an issue with chrome) and tell me if that works or not.\n. @epicserve are you sure your setup is correct? I could reproduce your error with defining an m2m-field with both related_lookups and autocomplete_lookups. But it doesn't seem to be a bug with grappelli. The placeholder is only used with related lookups (but not with autocompletes).\n. sure. check the django documentation on this:\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.extra\n. The \"easiest\" way to achieve this is probably to overwrite the js (/admin/actions.js). Other than that, I don't really see a way to handle this.\n. @parsch what do you think?\n. did you add the grappelli urls?\n. since you get this error it's probably much easier for you to track a possible bug ... could you try to debug that issue?\n. @eandersons thanks for looking into that \u2013 I think I've found a solution.\n. @camilonova will be part of the next pypi release. thank you for the patch.\n. @camilonova within the next two weeks.\n. sorry ... lots of other stuff to do. Hope I'll find the time to add that update soon.\n. can't think of a way to achieve this (seems quite complicated, esp. with inlines).\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions.\n. grappelli 2.6 is not compatible with django 1.6.\nas far as I know, nested inlines are currently not possible with django \u2013 and it's not related to grappelli.\n. usually, you do not copy the folder at all but install with pip instead (so grappelli is part of your virtual envinronment and not your project).\nother than that, grappelli is an ordinary django app \u2013 so please refer to the django docs on how to install applications.\n. grappelli has to be before django.contrib.admin with INSTALLED_APPS. besides, please use the google-group for asking questions (this is an issue tracker).\n. how should we be able to reproduce this? grappelli version? django version? model? model-admin? any js errors?\nplease re-open with all necessary details.\n. sorry, we decided to not include translation files for jQuery UI (we'll remove existing files as well).\n. already solved, see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/commit/7e0847ad6093daa6f9d96bc653af60f8948121cd\n. just tested \u2013 works fine with my setup. you need to add django.contrib.admindocs to your INSTALLED_APPS after grappelli.\nIf you think this is a bug, please try to debug and re-open this issue adding some details.\n. thanks for looking into this. it's strange though that the docs work with my setup.\n. @edwinlunando great. thank you!\n. https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/stable/2.5.x\n. see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/559\n. which grappelli version, which django version?\n. base.htm, line 86:\n{% firstof user.get_short_name user.get_username %}\nso you say that isn't working for your case? any chance to debug this issue?\n. can't reproduce ... models are being sorted fine even without verbose_name/verbose_name_plural with my test case. more details?\n. ok ... finally got it.\n. I currently don't see any performance improvements ... the main issue is that we need to do a request for each and every autocomplete (because the functionality is not built-in with django and the necessary items are not available with an ordinary change form).\n. I don't think pagination is possible (though that is a django issue).\n. IMO django should give us the object representation, but it currently doesn't. If we have the title (for example), we don't need to use an ajax-call when loading the page. I don't see a workaround unless django adds the necessary elements ... but they probably won't.\n. this should already be solved ... which version of grappelli are you using?\n. According to the django docs, you should not assume the admin templates to be rendered correctly, if TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID is set to anything other than an empty string.\nTherefore, what exactly is the issue here?\n. that may be true, but it's a django design decision that admin doesn't have to work if that string is not empty. however, if you're able to submit a patch I'll give it a review (please reopen this issue if you wanna take on that work).\n. @mpasternak I'm -1 on supporting django-compressor out of the box. We should try to limit any dependencies and it's pretty straightforward to get django-compressor up and running (well ... besides the mentioned error with translation files).\n. @msamoylov Sorry, can't follow ...\n. @msamoylov We'll remove ui localization ... see #528 ... https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/pull/528#issuecomment-77523683\n. @msamoylov Let's keep this issue for reference (other people might look for this error message as well). Will do the update within the next couple of days.\n. this is either not easy to solve or I am missing something. first, I'm not able to reproduce this (both collectstatic and compress works fine with my setup). second (and probably more important), there is no file ui.datepicker-en-us.js with jquery/i18n.\n. No 'compress' template tags found in templates.\n. what I don't get here: why would compress look for ui.datepicker-en-us.js since that file is never being referenced within a termplate (as mentioned before, that file doesn't even exist with jqueryUI).\n. I'm about to add a new release, but I would like this issue to be solved before. So please let me know if there's any additional information. \n. which commit exactly? the localized calendar has not been commited IMO.\n. strange for me as well ... lets wait for another reply and see if someone might have worked with your branch instead of master/stable, because that would explain the issues. and that would also explain why I have never been able to reproduce this bug.\nI wanna be sure about this before pushing another version to pypi.\n. I'm closing this since that is not an issue with the currently available branches IMO. Please reopen (with additional details) if you don't think this is solved.\n. are you aware that we fire the lookup-call twice when adding this behaviour?\n. closing this for now since it does not fully work. please send a new PR if you still work on this issue. besides, the \"focus\" is necessary in order for the autocompletes to work.\n. did you define an app_label within your app?\nthe proposed patch is not the right way to solve this \u2013 but I actually doubt that we're talking about a bug here.\n. besides, which django version are you using?\n. Can you please send your INSTALLED_APPS, your URLs, the k2 model and k2 modeladmin (gist is preferred instead of pasting it here).\n. your URLs look a bit strange to me ... both common/k2 start withurl(r'^',. other than that, it looks ok to me. \nadditional question: you don't have apps defined, have you? see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/applications/\n. Closing this since I'm pretty sure it's not a bug (besides, the mentioned functionality is covered with testcases).\n. Good point. I'm actually not quite sure how to solve this. I just tried with not splitting the term (line 139 in related.py) and it works as expected.\nI don't remember why we decided to split the term. It doesn't seem to make much sense (but I might be missing something).\n. Unfortunately, that's currently not possible. But it would be a fine improvement. Any idea on a good implementation?\n. The search-link is generated with Django (not Grappelli) by using raw-id fields. That's the link we use for autocompletes as well.\nThat being said, issue #403 is somehow similar in terms of retrieving ModelAdmin with the frontend. Generally speaking, I think ModelAdmin is the class to look at \u2013 we should try to define the lookup queryset with ModelAdmin instead of relying on autocomplete_search_fields (or maybe combine both setups).\n. Sorry, but I'm not able to follow ... subclassing the widget is bound to a specific field (if I'm using M2Ms I need to subclass a different widget). That seems a bit strange ... or I just don't get it.\n. closing this for now since there hasn't been any updates in a while now.\n. No worries, I just didn\u00b4t have the time yet.\n. interesting ... we just changed that because of a pull request (see #579). what python version are you using?\n. I'm not able to reproduce this ... I'm using Grappelli 2.6.4 and Django 1.7.\nverbose_name = u\"Dergi \u0130\u00e7erikleri\"\nverbose_name_plural = u\"Dergi \u0130\u00e7erikleri\"\nworks fine.\n. @tatterdemalion @twopac @Seleznev-nvkz @robslotboom ... can anybody give me a hint on how to reproduce this with django 1.7 and grappelli 2.6.4?\n. @Seleznev-nvkz thanks, but I don't get an error. works fine with my setup (python 2.7.3, django 1.7, grappelli 2.6.4)\n. alright ... I finally could reproduce this. using \"unicode\" doesn't make sense since python3 uses \"str\".\nmy suggestion is to change line 113 of utils.py to:\npattern_items.sort(key=lambda x: str(x[0]._meta.verbose_name_plural.encode('utf-8')))\nmaybe someone can test this as well and give some feedback. from my point of view, it's a clean solution and it should work with python2 and python3.\n. That's because Grappelli is not yet compatible with Django 1.8.\n. Please try with stable/2.7.x.\n. Please reopen this ticket if the issue still exists. \n. @jieter I'll add a new branch and then let you know (probably tomorrow).\n. please use branch dev/2.7.x instead of master for compatibility with django 1.8\n. Thanks a lot for looking into that. I'll check this issue once we work on compatibility with Django 1.8.\n. @ngzhian There's a new branch dev/2.7.x in order to work on compatibility with Django 1.8.\n. @ngzhian With branch stable/2.7.x (and dev/2.7.x) the related object functionality should be fine. For now, we didn't implement the new \"edit\" feature (we'll do that once all other bugs are resolved). Please give it a try and let me know if there are still issues.\n. closing this since no further feedback has been given (the edit feature is another issue anyway).\n. please use branch dev/2.7.x instead of master for compatibility with django 1.8\n. True. Grappelli is not yet compatible with Django 1.8.\n. closing this since no details are given.\n. please use branch dev/2.7.x instead of master for compatibility with django 1.8\n. should be solved with the mentioned branch. please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. dev/2.7.x is only working with Django 1.8 (it doesn't have to be backwards compatible because there are other versions of grappelli which work with older versions of django).\n. that's much appreciated!\n. Should work now. I'll add a note about adding grappelli.dashboard after django.contrib.contenttypes to INSTALLED_APPS.\n. Closing this for now since all warnings should be gone (with stable/2.7.x). Please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. see #590 \n. which versions (django/grappelli)?\n. Note: Grappelli is not yet compatible with Django 1.8.\n. see #593 \n. same here ... I'm not able to follow this.\n. closing this since no further details are given. please add a new pull-request with additional information.\n. I'm currently taking a look. Unfortunately, I'm not able to merge this since some stuff is missing with RelatedObjetcLookups.js.\n. should be solved with dev/2.7.x and stable/2.7.x ... please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. versions please!!!\n. and which django version???\n. it's fixed (see my commit above)!\n. Sorry, I don't get it ... you want to add <li> to a template without having a surrounding <ul>?\n. I'm not sure it answers my question ... so you actually wanna add list-elements without having a list, right? Isn't that weird?\n. @alex1989 sorry for the delay. happy with the fix?\n. Closing this since it should be fixed. Please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. should work with stable/2.7.x ... please reopen if the issue still exists.\n. that would be nice indeed. does django-admin-sortable work with grappelli? do we just need to change the styles?\n. I'm having a raw-id-field with tabular inlines ... I do get the edit link with the field. The same field within the changeform and no edit link is given. Can someone please explain how this \"feature\" is supposed to work, because I just don't seem to get it!\n. it would be considered ... a consistent implementation is a requirement though (see my first comment).\n. please reopen the tickets with adding versions (django, grappelli).\n. Please add a description to this pull-request. I'm not able to reproduce this issue (I actually don't know what the issue is in the first place). Autocomplete works fine for me.\n. sorry, but that seems to be out of scope. besides, shouldn't that be a django issue instead of a grappelli issue?\nIMHO the filter_horizontal widget should be removed completely.\n. Did you add a ModelAdmin for ContentType?\n. closing this since no further details are given.\n. this is already fixed.\n. you are right.\n. this is already fixed.\n. @oelium cannot reproduce. please open a new ticket and add some details (django.utils.importlib is not available with related.py).\n. there is no django.contrib.admin.util in related.py\n. wrong grappelli version, I guess:\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/views/related.py#L17\n. fixed with stable/2.7.x\n. are you sure that this is a grappelli issue?\n. Please use the Google-Group for asking questions (hint: add Django/Grappelli versions). If you think this is a bug, please reopen this ticket and add some debugging details.\n. @michael-fairfly do you know how that fix is related to this ticket? because the pull-request is about the reversion template, your ticket doesn't mention reversion.\n. alright, thanks for the clarification.\n. @mmarksnippety this pull-request is empty. \n. @nemesisdesign which version of grappelli are you targeting?\n. @nemesisdesign thanks for the clarification.\n. just merging pull requests ... will happen today.\n. Could you please add an example so I'm able to reproduce this issue with my setup?\n. true ... but that's just the template documentation, so not a major issue here. we'll take a look.\n. closing this since nor further details are given. please reopen if this issue still exists.\n. instead of trying to improve get_app_label ... isn't it better to generate the correct link in the first place?\n. I see. \n. what happens if you deactivate grappelli? do you get a different result?\n. can you try to find out what's causing this? because I'm not able to reproduce it.\n. Please use the google-group for asking questions. Thank you!\nBesides: there is a whole lot of answers to this question already (because it is not related to grappelli).\n. search for extending django admin templates (not related to grappelli). you can add custom css with your model admin definition or you can overwrite base.html and add your css there.\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-asset-definitions\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#overriding-admin-templates\n. Thanks \u2013 I'll take a look at this one. Adding checks is a good idea anyway.\nI don't quite get your comment on adding the tests though.\n. python manage.py test grappelli\n. where's the commit?\n. thanks! I'll take a look at the failed test.\n. wait ... you wanna submit more PRs? in that case it's better to wait for all your PRs instead of merging every single one, right?\n. sorry ... working on it. we had to do an intermediate release for 1.8 compatibility. this one's one the list for the next release.\n. I'm getting ImportError: cannot import name 'HTTPSHandler' when trying to run tox. Any idea?\n. ok. got it ... but shouldn't we use 3.5 instead of 3.4?\n. ok \u2013 I'll change that. just trying to figure out why the tests break with 3.5 (seems a bit strange).\n. solved. error gone.\n. thanks again for that PR. while this issue is basically solved ... what about adding travis-ci? any objections?\n. I'm fine with writing the travis file ... \nBut one question remains: If we use travis, we could test with multiple python 3.x versions. However, if I add these versions to tox, I'm not able to run the test locally (because not all different python versions are installed with my machine). I'm not even sure if it makes sense to test with e.g. 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. Maybe it is totally overdone. Any thoughts?\n. did you try to debug this issue? any details?\n. which version of grappelli? which django version? which browser?\n. grappelli 2.7 is not compatible with django 1.7, see http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#versions-and-compatibility\n. thanks a lot for the PR!\n. thanks again (trying to improve yesterdays weak response time).\n. see http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization.html#sortable-excludes\nIf there is one value within the row (e.g. quantity or units) we assume that this row has been added. Therefore the validation error (even with a different field).\n. @jieter any suggestion on the wording?\n. @jieter thanks ... good points. I reopen this ticket as a reminder for updating the docs.\n. @jieter Tried my best to explain the behaviour. Please reopen if you still think we can improve this.\n. thanks for reporting. why do you think python 2.7.9 could be deprecated?\n. just tested the original issue (switch user dropdown) again and it works fine with my setup. I'm closing this issue for now ... please reopen a new one if this error (or one of the others) still exists.\nno worries about the waste of time. you mainly figured it out yourself anyway.\n. are you sure the right actions.js is being loaded (the grappelli one and not the one from django admin)?\n. just check if actions.js is equal to grappellis actions.js (you only need to copy the URL and check with your browser).\n. Well ... then you have to make sure the correct one is being loaded. Seems more like a setup/Django issue than related to grappelli.\n. yep, it's strange indeed. there has been a ticket about this issue a while ago, but I've never been able to reproduce this behaviour.\n. /static/admin/js/actions.js should be the grappelli file (although it probably isn't with your setup). due to the way collectstatic works, you might wanna try to re-install grappelli and then do collectstatic again.\nif you do python manage.py findstatic admin/js/actions.js the grappelli file should be the first one.\n. @SebasSBM this seems like a strange solution, because both /django/contrib/admin/ and /grappelli/ are apps. so changing the order with STATICFILES_FINDERS shouldn't really change anything.\n. filebrowser doesn't interfere. what could interfere though is updating django (after installing grappelli).\nthat being said, I have no clue about which direction to take either. people already opened tickets about this topic \u2013 but soon afterwards, they closed it because of caching or setup issues. I'm glad if somebody is able to find out if this is a problem indeed and if it is related to grappelli.\n. @SebasSBM what do you mean by \"external apps\" vs \"internal apps\"? IMO there is no such difference, there are just apps.\n. see #666 ... seems that your staticfiles are not loaded correctly (esp. actions.js).\n. just by looking at the code briefly this seems like a good change (no reason whatsoever for hardcoding these values).\n. a) searching related fields should be possible\nb) comparing the autocomplete search with the change-list admin search is misleading. these options are not related whatsoever.\nc) defining the autocomplete fields within admin (rather than the model) would be nice. unfortunately, I don't think that's possible. but if someone comes up with a good idea on how to implement that, I'm all ears.\nbesides, please use the google-group for asking questions ... thank you!\n. I'd use a separate modeadmin instead (with list_editables on the changelist). To be honest, I don't see how pagination with inlines could work ... are you able to show a demo?\n. @theeluwin what exactly is the issue you are having with putting together a PR? do you have in mind that we need to deal with possible form errors on all the different sub-pages?\n. closing this for now ... although it's an interesting topic. happy to take a look at a PR.\n. @vinnyrose thanks (also for using the right branch!)\n. @joshmaker the same is true for fieldset_inline.html, right?\n. @debnet FYI: We're dealing with 1.9 once there's an official release. I'm closing this for now since there's probably tons of issues with 1.9.\n. support for 1.9 is definitely planned ... I hope to find some spare time within the next couple of days. sorry for the delay on this issue.\n. Not reproducable. Can you add details?\n. Well, I could guess ... but that probably doesn't help. Maybe you wanna add this question to the google-group and see if anyone has similar issues. And come back here once we're talking about an issue. Ok?\n. I'm closing this for now. Happy to reopen the ticket if we're able to narrow down the possible issue.\n. @ydaniv one note on this one: if the requests are identical, it seems to be a problem with django (because we just react on errors given by django). on the other hand, you could just try the original django-admin and check if the issue still exists ... if not, it's probably a grappelli issue.\n. this is not related to grappelli, is it?\n. @hhio618 sorry, but I'm not able to reproduce this. can you pls send your custom dashboard class or any other information which might be helpful.\n. grappelli is already working with python 3.4 for quite a while (see travis tests).\n. thanks. there's only one problem: travis currently does not support testing with python 3.5 \u2013 I'm not sure we should implement these updates until we can test properly. any objections?\n. I'm reopening this issue for future reference. Once travis supports testing with 3.5, we'll merge this.\n. thanks. is that PR going to be part of django 1.9?\n. I see ... how do you think we should handle this with grappelli? Wait until it's being implemented with Django or try to figure it out right now? Any preferences?\n. @graingert just tried to use your patch, but I'm seeing lots of errors with my local setup (JS variables not defined etc). is this supposed to work?\n. @graingert I've reverted the merge with stable/2.8.x ... there's just too many issues for me to resolve now (e.g. almost all paths are wrong, you use \"grapelli\" instead of \"grappelli\" etc). happy to take a look at this again if you're sending a tested PR.\n. sorry, but I don't understand that question. you could just use it with any given project.\n. closing this for now. please reopen with a new PR (thanks for your effort on this topic).\n. thanks for the PR. will merge asap.\n. @graingert great stuff. I'll take a look asap ... what do you mean with \"examples\"?\n. sorry, I don't get it ... how are the tinymce examples related to your PR?\n. @graingert I don't think updating the tinymce examples is relevant. There are currently no test scripts for the UI.\n. @graingert working on it. this should be part of the upcoming release compatible with django 1.9, right? or did you plan to have these changes with the current grappelli version as well?\n. @graingert great. we'll release a new version (2.7.3) today (compatible with Django 1.8) because there's been some minor bugfixes. afterwards, we'll work on compatibility with Django 1.9.\n. @graingert is it simple for you to send that PR again (using branch stable/2.8.x)? otherwise I'll try to cherry-pick ...\n. @graingert I was not aware that Django does it that way ... we've always tried to keep master stable with grappelli. But I'll give it a try.\n. @tdruez that issue should be addressed with django reversion first, right?\n. yes, preserve filters is not related to grappelli. it's mainly about using the \"add_preserved_filters\" template tag with links.\n. closing this for now since it's not mainly related to grappelli. once the reversion templates are updated, we'll take a look as well.\n. should be fixed with master \u2013 can you give that a try?\n. @dhararon thanks! will do another release pretty soon.\n. 2.7.3 is out now\n. there's probably lots of errors with django 1.9 ... we'll deal with this once 1.9 is being released (see docs).\n. please use the google-group for asking questions. if you think this is a bug, please add details in order to debug (and try to explain why this error is related to grappelli, if that\u00b4s even the case). did you try to remove grappelli and see if the error exists with the original django admin?\n. Is this a question or a bug report? Any details resp. debugging infos?\n. fixed with stable/2.8.x\n. no idea \u2013 but it should be straightforward to debug this issue. besides, please use the google-group for asking questions ... if you think this is a bug, please add some details.\n. which version of grappelli are you using?\n. is python 3.5 already supported by travis (because it hasn`t been about a month ago)?\n. @dbinetti I think you answered your own question with the 2nd comment. We need to use raw_id_fields, because otherwise we do not get the related link we need to use the js autocomplete workaround. Not sure if we're able to solve this ... if you have an idea, please let me know.\n. are you sure that your staticfiles are set up correctly? do you get the grappelli javascripts and styles?\n. is this solved? can we close this issue?\n. closing this for now since it seems to be a setup issue. please reopen if the problem still exists with the deployed version.\n. @clutcher @ninjaa I see what you mean. But with the proposed \"fix\", we do have another issue - see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/pull/646\n. should be solved, see #685 \n. Hi @ninapavlich and @olivierdalang ... it's great that you both wanna help improving Grappelli (thanks!!!). Unfortunately, we are still not sure about the roadmap. Giving the current structure (e.g. inlines), it's very hard to make it work with mobile devices. Still thinking about a decent solution ...\nConcerning \"hacking\" the CSS to make it a bit less unpractical: Our goal is to offer a good solution, not one which is \"less unpractical\". Therefore, I don't think that's the right way to go.\n. fixed with stable/2.8.x\n. @drxos please note that full compatibility with Django 1.9 is not yet given.\n. sounds good. can you provied tests for this behaviour?\n. fixed with stable/2.8.x\n. @parsch what exactly do you get? works fine with my setup.\n. @michalwerner I do think it's related to django-pipeline. please try again without that package.\n. see #714 \n. sorry, I don't understand your question ... grappelli is not yet compatible with django 1.9. besides, please use the google-group for asking questions.\n. Compatibility with Django 1.9 is planned. And grappelli has a dashboard ... but I still don't understand the question.\n. you are not using grappelli due to your screenshot!\n. you know that the current release is not compatible with django 1.9, right?\n. see #714 \n. these are issues with django.contrib.admin, not grappelli ... right?\n. grappelli 2.7 is not compatible with django 1.9. use grappelli 2.8 and reopen this ticket, if the problem still exists.\n. tested with stable/2.8.x and master ... works for me (might be related to the last commit which fixed popup_response.html). so please give this a try again and reopen if the bug still exists.\n. @tdruez @pombredanne well ... good PR. right branch, easy to follow (including links).\n. @garyelephant closing this for now \u2013 please reopen with additional information in order to reproduce this.\n. @chasepilon you should check if the right grappelli scripts are being loaded (and not the original scripts from the django admin interface), e.g. with using developer tools. I'm closing this for now since it's most probably a setup issue and not a grappelli bug. Please reopen with additional information if you still think this is a bug.\n. @parsch please take a look at this one and fix with stable/2.7.x, stable/2.8.x and (upcoming) stable/2.9.x\n. I don't think that HTML with the admin title has ever been possible ... but if you're able to give me a hint on the specific commit, I'm happy to check this issue.\n. see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/stable/2.6.x/grappelli/templates/admin/base.html#L78\nare you sure that you did not use a custom template?\n. I don't get how this could be affected by Django itself. But I guess I have to give up here (not able to understand/reproduce this issue). Feel free to reopen with additional details (a PR would be useful).\n. What do you mean with \"not working\"? There's now a GO-Button to submit an action.\n. should be fixed now.\n. fixed with stable/2.8.x and master\n. I'm closing this since 2.7.3 is not compatible with Django 1.9. If the problem still exists with 2.8.x, please reopen this ticket.\n. 2.8.1 is still under development and there hasn't been a lot of feedback so far. but I see your point and I'll do a release later today (but please be aware that this version isn't fully tested).\n. alright \u2013 that's good to know.\n. thanks for the PR. we've had some issues with this behaviour in the past (changing the code lots of times). therefore, I'm only willing to change this if a useful test case is provided \u2013 as an alternative, you can try to explain what doesn't work now and what exactly that patch solves (and why it doesn't break any other cases).\n. did you check #706 and #403?\na test project would be useful. the main issue here is that I also \"think\" that it doesn't break any other cases, but I don't really now. and since we had problems with this behaviour in the past, I'm very cautious with merging changes without putting together a decent test case.\n. with \"this behaviour\" I'm referring to building the search query.\n. It's in 2.8.1 (for example).\n. I see. We'll think about doing a 2.7 release with this fix included. Unfortunately, we are not able to add  LTS comparable to django (we just don't have the necessary ressources).\nBesides, we don't say to use the 1.7 branch. First, this branch doesn't exist. Second, we refer to releases (not branches).\n. We decided to not release a new version for 2.7, but you can use the branch stable/2.7.x instead.. what do you plan to do with these docs? I'm not sure they are up-to-date.\n. that makes sense ... you could just copy/paste the URLs to your own urls.py (or outcomment them with grappelli).\n. django uses [wheel] instead of [bdist_wheel]. what should we use?\n. thanks. updated.\n. according to the error relation \"users_mycustomuser\" does not exist it is definitely not related to grappelli.\n. again, this is not a grappelli issue. you cannot use a custom user model without admin attributes (e.g. is_staff) for admin-related features.\n. > Do you mean that a custom user model will break tests programmatically?\nNot necessarily. It depends on the customization, but we are not able to foresee every possible case.\n\nSwitch won't be possible at all with a custom user model?\n\nDepends on the customization. You can check the function switch_user for details.\n\nIs there a place where these \"do and don't\"s are documented?\n\nNo. But if you find something which should be documented, we'll integrate it ... or (even better) you send a PR with the updated docs.\nGenerally speaking, it should be easy for you to figure out what's wrong. You can than either send a PR with the updated code (if tests are included, a merge is easier) or docs or you give us a hint on what we can/should do. \n. with the docs, you are referring to is_staff first and to is_admin later on. besides, why don't we just say that is_superuser and is_staff are required fields with a custom user model if you want to use the switch functionality?\n. not sure how we can solve this. but grappelli works, right? \n. closing this since it's not a grappelli issue. not sure if verbosity is a solution (mentioned with the django ticket).\n. it seems like you're using a custom header, right?\n. no issue with django-reversion, but your screenshot definitely shows a header with a custom height. \n. no, sorry. but check for your header \"Isotek ...\" within your code.\n. please check if this happens without grappelli as well (I assume it's not related to grappelli). you could also use the google-group for asking questions.\n. how can we reproduce this?\n. I'm not able to reproduce this. Still possible that there's an issue ... but without any further details, we are not able to check this. Since it happens for all models, I'd say it's probably a setup issue (unrelated to grappelli).\nPlease reopen with detailed instructions on how to reproduce this error \u2013 since you get it, it should be much easier for you to debug and give us some hints.\n. thanks for the info.\n. can anyone confirm that the proposed solution works with different languages?\n. the block might be a good idea \u2013 I'll take a look.\n. fixed with 78877e1be88836b13c52a993d115e8ecc65600fe\n. please use the google-group for asking questions ... besides, this is not related to grappelli (deleting inlines is a feature of the django admin interface).\n. Here is the documentation: http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dashboard_api.html\nYou could use a custom dashboard, for example. But there's probably different ways to achieve this. Besides, please use the google-group for asking questions.\n. which version of django/grappelli?\n. Not related to the styling issue, but ... you are using an M2M-autocomplete with inlines, right? Is that really necessary?\n. M2M seems good \u2013 alternatively, you could use a FK with an intermediate table (and inlines with the admin interface). The 2nd approach is better, if you need additional fields (e.g. position). But you mix both options ... \n. About the database setup: FK with an intermediate table means that you have inlines with a foreign key ... but you have inlines with M2M (that's done twice). If you post your models here I can tell you more about this.\n. Concerning the styling issue: Is it possible that either your related_label and/or your __str__ method contains HTML characters? If so, that causes the error.\n. 3) that\u00b4s the intended behaviour.\n4) the multiline textbox is fine for M2M autocompletes.\nhowever, I still think you should redefine the relationship with your database using foreign keys instead of many-to-many relations. could you please send the significant part of your models as well as your admin definitions?\nyour models should looke something like this ...\n```\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    (fields)\nclass Tag(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(u\"Name\", max_length=100)\n    slug = models.SlugField(u\"Slug\", max_length=100, db_index=True, blank=True)\n    (additional fields)\nclass TagToParent(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, verbose_name=u\"Parent\", related_name=\"USE_A_GOOD_NAME\")\n    tag = models.ForeignKey(Tag, verbose_name=u\"Tag\", related_name=\"USE_A_GOOD_NAME\")\n    (additional fields)\n```\nand your admin file ...\n```\nclass TagInline(admin.TabularInline):\n    model = TagToParent\n    raw_id_fields = (\"tag\",)\n    autocomplete_lookup_fields = {\n        \"fk\": [\"tag\"],\n    }\nclass ParentOptions(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    inlines = [TagInline]\n```\n. No, it does NOT look similar. As mentioned before, you are combining an inline with a many-to-many relation.  I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to achieve here ... and it is definitely not true that \"Django creates the intermediate table\" (it only does so if you explicitely tell Django). Django does create the M2M-table (but that's not a through-table).\nI'm closing this ticket for now since I'm pretty sure the issue is related to your setup. I would try to clean the models first. And if the issue still exists with a proper database setup, feel free to reopen this ticket.\n. an M2M is essentially the same as an intermediary table with a foreign key (with the 2nd offering more possibilities). so, admin-wise, you either go with a SINGLE M2M autocomplete field ... OR ... with inlines and foreign keys.\nmany-to-many is fine when using tags. but again, you're not using M2M ... your doing an M2M-M2M.\n. glad you solved it ... but I still think your database-setup (resp. model-setup) is not quite correct. but that's a bit out of scope with regards to grappelli.\n. I see what you mean and I generally agree.\nThat said, I'm not sure that the database setup you described with regards to product_name is the best solution ... there's still the possibility of people using the wrong name for similar products.\n. are the autocompletes working? can you do a search within the fields?\n. you need to define the autocomplete lookup fields like this:\nautocomplete_lookup_fields = { 'fk': ['invoice', 'credit_note'] }\n. 1. the tuple is used for searching. with the mentioned example, you search for id (exact) and name (icontains).\n2. key: right. \n3. you need raw_id_fields, because autocompletes is kind of a hack. we need the output of raw_id_fields with the template, because otherwise we do not get the ID.\n. you can use djangos field lookups. not sure why there's an error when removing id__iexact ... that shouldn't be the case (you may wanna try to debug that)\n. I think it only applies to inlines with \"view on site\" (that is, objects with get_absolute_url defined).\n. see #780 \n. I don't fully get this PR ... you say that the issue occurs with Django 1.9, but later you also say it's fine with 1.9. Besides, where exactly do you see this error? Only with the dev branch or with master as well?\n. @tdruez thanks. we are aware of these issue and have not yet started with 1.10 compatibility.\n. solved with stable/2.9.x\n. it is grappelli (not grapelli)\n. nope, the given path is correct\n. definitely interesting, but out of scope. besides, it seems that django-locking is no longer actively developed.\n. Is this related to grappelli or to django-autocomplete-light?\n. No ETA yet. We hope to start working on 1.10 support soon.\n. ETA is set to September 27th. I assume there are some minor updates needed (esp. in order to remove depreciation warnings, but I'll have a closer look asap).\n. solved with stable/2.9.x\n. please use the google group for asking questions.\n. @unaizalakain this PR does not work. if I submit an inline formset with updated positions and I have an error within that formset, the ordering is not correct. happy to review an updated PR.\n. @unaizalakain what do you mean with the formsetsort template? and yes, it has been working and it is still working.\n. @unaizalakain that\u00b4s exactly what I do ... but the order is only messed up with the PR applied (it works for me without your PR). can you do a test with the branch stable/2.9.x and django 1.10?\nbesides, if the sorting is messed up with your PR, you do agree that the PR is not exactly what we need ... right? or did I miss something?\n. @unaizalakain see https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/templates/admin/edit_inline/stacked.html#L17 ... the function is called every time the inline templates are used.\n. solved with stable/2.9.x\n. see branch stable/2.9.x ... should work. I'm just waiting for some feedback before the actual release.\n. you can checkout that branch and just play around. tests look fine, but I'm pretty sure there are still minor glitches. and if you do not find any bugs, that's a useful feedback as well.\n. @adamchainz We don't necessarily follow the jQuery updates of Django, but I'll take a look.\n. @florianm master is not compatible with django 1.10 \u2013 take a look at stable/2.9.x instead.\n. @adamchainz what exactly is the issue with jQuery (besides using a different version compared with the Django admin)?\n. > I've been looking around a bit. Django 1.10 upgraded from jQuery 2.1.4 to 2.2.3, but Grappelli 2.9.x is currently replacing that with version 2.1.4 again - shouldn't it be upgraded?\nthat\u00b4s true. but I don\u00b4t see any issues here.\n. > In fact b196350 copied in jQuery 2.2.3 (rather than just dropping the file to prevent static 'shadowing' of django.contrib.admin), but it still shadows jquery.init.js so the end result is that django.jQuery is the 2.1.4 version but window.jQuery is the 2.2.3.\nI'm sorry, but I do not understand this comment.\n. so we just need to add the comments again, right? additionally, we could also update the jquery version.\n. @debnet I'm not able to reproduce this. popups work fine with my setup. are you sure that you're using the updated files?\n. just released 2.9.1 (compatible with Django 1.10)\n. @adamchainz sorry, I don't quite get it ... the file setup.cfg is already there and you didn't change anything, right?\n. @tdruez I'll do a release in the next couple of days. I just waited for some feedback on compatibility with django 1.10.\n. hope this issue is solved.\n. please try branch stable/2.9.x ... 2.8.x is not compatible with django 1.10.\n. @rcooke you are right. we are aware of this issue and decided to not go with the \"?\" since it\u00b4s not consistent. that said, with regards to your usecase it definitely makes sense. we\u00b4ll take another look .... @parsch can you answer that?. change to django-style help text.\n@parsch please add styling. please explain ...\n. @orlra sorry, but I cannot follow. you know that overriding templates is a django issue, right? we don\u00b4t change that behaviour.. We changed this behaviour with Grappelli 2.8. It is not planned to update 2.7 though.. I'm not able to reproduce this. Works fine for me. Any details?. Thanks for the clarification.. we decided to not implement the number field since it behaves (very) different depending on the browser (one browser even accepts an empty field although that field is required, though I don\u00b4t remember which browser that was). I also added a django-ticket when we worked on that issue, but I'm currently not able to find that ticket anymore. However, the django devs agreed that the number field behaves badly (although they decided to stick with their solution).. as @etianen already mentioned, we need to adjust the templates. since I'm personally not using reversion, I didn't recognize that there have been changes according to the templates. my suggestion is to look into the reversion templates and compare it with the grappelli reversion templates and find the diffs. shouldn't be a big deal IMO.. @tsouvarev I don't quite understand where exactly we should use this new method. Any details on this?. that seems like an error with your configuration. if you think this is a bug, please add details and clarify why the noreversematch is caused by grappelli and/or how we could solve this.. I'm not able to reproduce this and it seems kind of weird. Are you saying that the ordering of MyModel interferes with the autocomplete for parent (because one has nothing to do with the other). Can you add more details and try to debug this?. closing this because no further details are given. please reopen if the problem still exists with the correct grappelli/django combination.. @tdruez Thanks for looking into it. I'll check compatibility with 1.11 asap (hopefully next week).. @Cediddi Planned for tomorrow. I'll check the issues and I'm hopefully able to have a new release by Friday.. both mentioned issues are solved with stable/2.10.x. @orlra Did you target branch dev/2.7.x by purpose? Because it\u00b4s pretty outdated \u2014 the development branch for the current version is stable/2.9.x.. see https://django-grappelli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization.html#available-settings . I'm pretty sure this is not related to grappelli. You could try to deactivate grappelli and check if the error still exists \u2013 if that\u00b4s not case, please reopen this ticket.. As said with the docs, these URLs are commented out by default (so you need to change this if you want to use the template docs).. sorry, not able to follow here. can you add an example?. thanks, I'll take a look at this.. FYI: I think I have a solution, but it\u00b4s a quite complicated update and I need to add some tests before pushing the changes.. see #639 . please use the google-group for asking questions (this is an issue tracker).\nhint: js/jquery.grp_timepicker.js (from lines 22). you should be able to use default_time_list.. thx for the pull request. I'll take a look.. can you please try with Grappelli 2.8.3? I'm not saying this issue is solved, but you refer to a version which is not maintained.. any specific reason you did not add the compiled css file?. @parsch can you confirm that this patch looks reasonable?. ",
    "parsch": "@sehmaschine: autocompletes should be focused when clicking their labels\n. autocomplete css have to be distributed to certain css-files before the autocompletes are released\n. @sehmaschine: yes, we might think about distinguishing the search-icons but then we have to have more different search-icons (also for filebrowse-fields). right now the search-icon does not rely to the type of the field it is associated with but just illustrates the action of opening some sort of changelist in a popup-window. \n. added predefined layout for changelist with filters in a sidebar.\n. thanks for reporting, should be fixed with 2 commits in the autocomplete branch:\ncommit 001db4ec75fd9ca16cc97176b6e4a8a6efb78cbd\ncommit 54bc70d155ed0c5b95e628f76e909c62bba62202\n. I just want to mention (as we discussed that point often before) that it is not possible to cover Grappelli with Bootstrap only. We would need a lot of additional/custom DOM and CSS to maintain the current possibilities of Grappelli.\n. @LeonardoGentile that's clear anyway... I just want to avoid heavy dependencies, css-mingle-mangle, using something as an alleged base which then has to be widely adapted. I generally don't refuse the idea of using Bootstrap, just pointing out my concerns.\n. @BertrandBordage First of all thanks for exploring that case. Based on experiences, I think your estimated hours meet the minimum efforts. Maybe you can give more detailed and actual descriptions of what you are working on, we will try our best to support possible questions on the fly. In my opinion an accurate layout of requirements dom- and css-wise, in combination with a projected dividing line between bootstrap and customs, could give a more precise idea of what has to be done.\n. @nym sorry, this issue has been closed for several reasons, mentioning two main important ones:\n1) the boostrap-issue has been discussed a lot, we always expressed our concerns about possibilities to base grappelli on bootstrap (reminder: you'll be able to implement/transfer 80% right away, but you'll fail when it comes to the last 20% and grappelli is about the last 20%). no one came up with a consistent solution that far, but feel free to surprise us ...\n2) the future of grappelli has to be something different than bootstrap, as bootstrap is quite outdated when it comes to modern frontend frameworks/technologies.\n. solved with 5134e3bd90cc840e79eb55a488548f0e2fa1e572\n. solved with d174682bbc1714bc071dbe4d29df705d5239c2e7\nof course the height of .selector-available and .selector-chosen differs if there's a multiline text in .selector-filter. that might be solved when using compass...\n. we'll take a look at that, thanks\n. this issue depends on  line 258 of tabular.html where we have to toggle the the .module.table twice to prevent webkit browsers from applying the border-spacing at wrong positions during dragging.\nwe have to do some research to find a smart solution for that.\n. the geoadmin icons will be supplied with the next release of grappelli\n. yes, I will supply them for older releases as well...\nand I'm reopening the issue (just to keep it in mind).\n. @sehmaschine: you are right \u2013 collectstatic collects the original admin images into the static folder. the gis-images are there...\n. also works with Grappelli 2.3\n. we'll take a look at that when releasing grappelli 2.4\n. The overflow:hidden is in there because it's needed when you got cells in a row. I moved the overflow:hidden to .row.cells which might solve your problem temporarily and will review the whole construction while working on grappelli 2.4, see #99\n. it's not there for clearfixing something, it's necessary to hide the vertical borders of .cells in .rows which have to overflow the height of the .rows (but you should not see the overflow) \u2013 however, a bit complicated. i will review that during the development of grappelli 2.4 and distribute a solution to 2.3 if i find one\n. @kylemacfarlane: thanks for reporting, didn't notice that it's used with the login-page...\n. ul.radiolist / ul.checkboxlist (both +inline)\n. a.related-lookup\n. elements mentioned in this ticket can't be namespaced\n. sorry for delay, simply have overseen that. should work now.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this/follow you, can you please provide some example or screenshot?\n. @iperatoner: can you also tell me which browser/os you are using?\n. thanks for reporting, should work now\n. components.css is not used with Grappelli 2.4 (checked the selectors there and they seem okay)\n. thanks for reporting, fixed it without patch because it has some dependencies\n. On the one hand you are right: Images like that have been \"replaced\" with Grappelli 2.3.8-\nThat did not happen with Grappelli 2.4 until now, that's why I applied the commit above.\nOn the other hand I don't get your point with css/buttons.css and js/SelectFilter2.js as they are not used in Grappelli 2.4\n. okay, that's what I thought. But you can't use Grappelli 2.3.8 with Django 1.4 anyway: http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n. @lauritzen: should work now...\n. @lauritzen you're welcome, thanks for reporting (and making me search for a cleaner solution)\n. no, that wasn't a design decision. the dashboard should of course show multiple columns as it ever did.\n. yes, you are right, the dashboard-files were missing the last changes... I've updated them, smaller fixes according styles will follow\n. @sehmaschine: collapse is not working with the dashboard (though the classes are there)\n. think that happended especially with field in grp-cells, should work now (otherwise please reopen this issue)\n. yes, that's because I changed the g-d-fluid classes (maybe we have to improve that but with a better solution then...)\n. working on that right now...\n. I know, display states and js seem to be broken/confusing...\n. works fine for me (selecting/unselecting all, rows going yellow, actions for multiple objects...). have you done a collectstatic?\n. ad 1) why?\nad 2) that's too greyish for my taste\nad 3) I would not unify the headings but we may increase the font-size of labels \u2013 on the other hand we need small font-sizes expecially in changelists\n. +1 for that as everything within Grappelli which could be namespaced should be namespaced \u2013 why refer to Django when you are dealing with Grappelli\n. thanks for reporting, fixed it\n. this is a grappelli issue (actually a tinymce issue within grappelli) - there's an issue: https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/167\n. the supported tinymce-plugins should be styled now.\n. Works fine for me. Are you sure you are using Grappelli 2.4?\n. There's a branch for Grappelli 2.4 (https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/grappelli_2_4). It's almost finished and will hopefully be released next week.\n. I don't quite understand what happened here: Can you please provide more info about your static-files setting? And why do you use a symbolic link? Which files haven been overridden?\nBasically a collectstatic with Grappelli should only collect the Grappelli-static-files. As we do not serve any django-based static files (beside some js) I'm wondering how that could override your django admin files (as colletstatic adds files and usually not overrides them).\n. we still need the general min-width of modules because of its possible contents but I excluded the submit-rows from that\n. ad 1) Fields defined as readonly are delivered as  \u2013 I'm not sure if you mean that...\nad grp-help) I cannot reproduce helptexts above widgets (SelectBox.js), please provide more information (code/screenshot)\n. Just wondering how you get the helptext above the selectors as we remove it in SelectFilters2.js\nShould be working now.\n. Okay, thought something like that. If you want you may provide your improvements...\n. I added the experimental svg-support for IE9. Please note, that Grappelli isn't tested with non-standard-compliant browsers (and we also do not support IE8 and lower because of poor CSS3 and HTML5 capabilities).\n. I can't reproduce this \u2013 looks well in my IE9 (and should have been fixed with 320b73ab5d7eabf5775f8ba39d666dfbc44ef44b).\nI got the SVG background and the sprite.\n. To use background-image is not always possible as I dynamically combine background-gradients and background-images (combinations of gradients and icons). And about the SVG/gradient fallback: I'm sorry but most of modern browsers support at least one of that and we are not going to begin writing fallbacks.\n. I think this is duplicate and already was fixed, see #113. Please make sure you got the commit and collected the static. If the problem still exists the please reopen the ticket.\n. should be fixed with 320b73ab5d7eabf5775f8ba39d666dfbc44ef44b, see also #178\n. thanks for reporting, fixed it.\n. @lboaretto: beside changing \"grappelli/stylesheets/partials/custom/tinymce.css\" you also have to update \"grappelli/stylesheets/screen.css\" as it contains selectors for those buttons\n. I applied another fix, hope it works for you and strongly recommend that you update your browser (as Grappelli is tested with Firefox 14.0+)\n. @lboaretto: Your screenshot shows that you must be definitely missing some styles as there is a button but no icon. With my Firefox 15.0 everything looks fine (there is an icon and the button is at the right place). Don't know... Did you collect your static files?\n. Compass creates sprite images on the fly which means that their names might change from time to time. You have to get the new icons-sprite. Why don't you just check out Grappellis stable/2.4.x branch \u2013 all recent changes are in there.\n. thanks for reporting. should work now.\n. RTL styles for TinyMCE are not working properly: Some could be fixed but beside that there are crticial points where the DOM is a problem, e.g. with the .mceListBox (dropdown menu for styles, fonts etc.)\nI'm not sure if we are going to implement an RTL-version of TinyMCE.\n. As there was no further feedback concerning the rtl-styles I close this issue.\n. yes\n. Something must be broken in the DOM of your changelist as it should definitely look like the first screenshot on http://www.grappelliproject.com/ (even without date-hierarchy). Did you customize anything? Can you take a look at the dom (especially for elements not being closed)?\n. The missing backgrounds have been fixed (see #178). Which IE are you using?\n. We'll take a look at that.\n. After trying some things out we decided to postpone that. Basically I like the idea of those tooltip-helptexts but I don't like that they would work very different than all other helptexts (introduce a new behaviour).\nBesides that it can be recommended to use a description if you want to avoid repeating long helptexts.\nI leave this issue open as we might come back to that.\n. I'll take a look at.\n. I tested this issue in Grappelli 2.4.2 with a multiline helptext for a charField in a tabular inline and cannot reproduce it.\nThe p.grp-help has a \"max-width: 278px\" there and also the inherited \"white-space:nowrap\" is overwritten by a \"white-space:normal !important\".\nWhat Grappelli version are you using/talking about? Which Browser/OS?\n. Never mind the mistake. Thanks for pointing to the concerned CSS. I made some changes to solve the mentioned 2 problems, hope it works for you (tested it on Chrome/Safari/Firefox/IE9).\n. @sehmaschine: it's also not necessary to have that sentence twice. we should remove one (either the pre_content of dashboard/modules.py line 348 or the else-clause of dashboard/modules/recent_actions.html line17f).\n. @sehmaschine: +1 for covering such minor fallbacks... They should be placed in django-resets.scss as this refers to                                            erything concerning the original Django.\n. Can you be more specific? \n. I am sorry, but your screenshots are far beyond known minor rendering issues in IE8/9. As I assume that you cleared your cache, collected static files etc. I just got one guess left: Is your IE running in that strange mode where it behaves like an older version of itself?\n. I'm afraid that we won't be able to solve the mentioned issues with IE8.\nWe do not provide any html5shim/v javascript (that would be easy) but also the $experimental-support-for-svg: truedoesn't work with IE8. Furthermore we use some layout-props which are not understood by IE8.\n. Actually they should have the same height. What browser are you using?\n. I took a closer look at that: The height of the second box is calculated and assigned by js (admin/js/admin/SelectFilter2.js line 102 and following). As there occured some inaccuracies according different browsers I assigned fixed heights and skipped the whole js-calculation.\n. Adding a height is not a good solution. The timepicker should rather be openend to the top (like datepickers do in that case).\n. The styles for selecting month/year in date widget have already been there, I improved them a bit.\nIf you want to use such a datepicker (with custom/different options) you have to load a custom js.\n. @lvelezsantos: Just want to let you know that there's a related question and some advice on how to implement a customized datepicker, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/django-grappelli/nPZe74hR9NE\n. when reporting an issue you have to give more accurate details: which functions in which context are not working in your opinion?\n. @doganmeh Grappelli is based on a very different grid system, on which allows controlling horizontal and vertical spacings throughout the whole design process, see http://muellergridsystem.com/ \n. fixed with 9f396116125d7c139524b6cd193fd477ef7faca6\n. basically yes, testing would be appreciated.\n@floledermann: can you try the last commit?\n. thanks!\n. set vertical-align: top; for some form fields. still has to be tested with all combinations.\n. test results seem to be ok\n. it's the mark_safe: it returns paragraphs in the mentioned case and as the grp-readonly is a paragraph itself the visible output fails.\nwe are going to change the p.grp-readonly to a div.grp-readonly\n. I would not change the process of clicking the cross and marking a line as being deleted on save. That's what a user has to understand (and that wouldn't be obvious if a line disappears immediately). We discussed the styles before (reducing opacities, different colors, icon changes, ...) but came to no better solution. If there are any suggestions of how to improve those styles then let me know please.\n. which OS/browser?\n. I added the pagebreak (as an example of how to use the customizable files/folders, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/django-grappelli/VMIZRLfmd6Q).\n. @alexander-ae: Please put your custom styles into the files/folders mentioned here: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/django-grappelli/VMIZRLfmd6Q\n. thanks for reporting\n. All those fields (independent of their possible types) are \"hidden\" via some class now. Testing is appreciated.\n. thanks, you're right, I refined it.\n. should work now\n. thanks for reporting @paramburu \n. Thanks for reporting, I'll take a look at that.\nAm Freitag, 22.

The add-button is hidden via jquery.grp_inline.js depending on TOTAL_FORMS and MAX_NUM_FORMS (it's not asking for permissions there). Anyway, the hidden add-button with display: none was still visible as grp-tools items in .gpr-closed need the property display: block !important. I fixed that via css with really hiding such hidden buttons.\n. Thanks for reporting, I take a look at that. Might be related to #316.\n. thanks for reporting, fixed it with the suggested change to position: relative\n. I added the suggested styles by myself as there are changes to the alterative changelist-template according to that: First we check if there's an overflow and then add a class which handels the overflow.\n. I raised the padding-right for form fields followed by a button (lowering the padding would break the grid): That applies to datepicker-fields, timepicker-fields, fields with a generic lookup (related, fk, m2m) and filebrowse-fields.\n. A custom width should not affect the behaviour of such an input-field, as its padding remains the same (24px, which is the width of the button overlapping the field).\n. I moved the included header.html back to base.html\nOverriding/extending {% block userlinks %} and {% block nav-global %} should work again.\nFurthermore I had to change some password-change templates which doubled the userlinks.\n. @benebun Yes, I'm keeping an eye on that issue\n. Hi Johannes, thanks for sharing your work, we'll take a closer look (quite busy right now).\n. @sehmaschine the images should be found now\n. Unfortunately we can not provide any wording change.\nI altered the colors (there should be slightly more contrast now) and provided an extra icon. \n. +1 for that. we'll have a thought on how this might look.\n. IMO such a block would only work, if it appeared only one time per page. as there might be multiple stacked inlines such a block would cause an error. I think it would be best to define a custom jquery function which inserts the \"onAfterAdded\" to a specific stacked inline.\n. Can you give me a short explanation why it is more difficult to customize the user actions using {% block userlinks %} right now?\n. Ok, I think I get your point. We have to think about a solution (considering #335 extending blocks in includes is not possible) how to solve that. If you have any idea, let me know.\n. In case you want to override a block only, you are not able to access blocks within the include from outside, see #335\n. I favor the idea of using different blocks to customize parts of the header (#538), which would not be possible if the header was an include. Therefore I removed the obsolete header includes.\n. I modified the selectors, should work with CachedStaticFilesStorage now \u2013 testing is appreciated. \nSee 4f0ca2a0949eb1484f06e2f80ad5b4a8b9ceb750\n. @morlandi Thanks for fixing\n. thanks for reporting, should work now\n. Since we use Github as an issue tracker and furthermore this question is not related to Grappelli I'm closing this.\nPlease use other ways to ask questions concerning django.\n. As this is an issue-tracker (and I'm not sure whether your are describing a bug or asking a question), I would ask you to post your problem to the google group https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!forum/django-grappelli \u2013 it might be answered faster there\n. thanks for reporting\n. I changed the css as it seems to be more reasonable than deleting html-elements.\n. We didn't yet find a way to translate the datepicker ( #318 , #5 ) \u2013 the only solution for now is to add your custom translation by using a Media inner class on your ModelAdmin (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-media-definitions).\n. As mentioned before you could e.g. also use \n\n```\nclass MyModel(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    ...\nclass Media:\n    js = [\n        \"/PATH_TO_YOUR/custom.ui.datepicker-it.js\",\n    ]\n\n```\nWhy should we collect translations in the meantime? They are all there (jQuery UI)...\n. @nebstrebor thanks for preparing this.\nFor now it works in debug mode only as @sehmaschine the JS files have to be minified again.\n. @nebstrebor thanks for preparing this.\nFor now it works in debug mode only as @sehmaschine the JS files have to be minified again.\n. thanks for reporting\n. There is no change_form_top_model.html with Grappelli.\n. This would result in an empty <ul  class=\"grp-object-tools\"> if a user has no add-permission and there are no third-party buttons. I'll take a look at that.\n. fixed with c1178727098ed3f3ca50da82c18db8e189b64212 (see also a1d3ff0707ea16795c576a1640d304e32dfe9766)\n. This is a problem in which context?\n. Which version of django and grappelli?\n. What sort of custom widget do you use? How is ist defined?\n. As there are no <input type=\"button\" /> with Django/Grappelli (at least I couldn't find any having a peek), I disabled them extending grp-icon-button. That declaration was moved to tinyMCE's namespace as there might be use cases with tinyMCE.\n@pauliuszaleckas Does that work for you?\n. I made some style changes to make the <input type=\"button\" /> look similar like a grp-icon-button\n. I partially agree with 2&3: I separated values by commas and added a strike-through for the pre-remove state. Think that's enough \u2013 distinctive blocks, \"X\" etc. are way too much emphasize imo.\n. Those images are already there: https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/grappelli_2_4/grappelli/static/grappelli/jquery/ui/css/custom-theme/images\nCan you provide additional information?\n. The \"standard\" django dashboard has just 2 columns. You can define a custom dashboard with grappelli, then you will have 3 columns and be able to place single apps/modules within certain columns. If you need more than 3 columns you have to write your own dashboard template.\nhttp://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dashboard_setup.html#custom-dashboard\nhttp://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dashboard_api.html\n. I'll have a look at that, might be related to #405 \n. I just tested with Grappelli (dev/2.6.x) using Django 1.7b4 (Chrome/Safari/Firefox) and I'm not able to reproduce this.\nCan you check again and provide additional information?\n. okay, don't worry\n. Some thoughts:\nIf we use all original classes in addition, it's going to be messy, of course. Using a selection only makes not much sense imo as we don't know which classnames for which packages might be needed.\nFurther we changed some dom-structures with Grappelli which might cause incompatibilities too (even if there are original classnames).\nIt would be some hours of work to reassign all those original classnames in addition to the grp ones. Basically there should be no visual interferences as Grappelli doesn't deliver Django's original stylesheets. There will be visual interferences with dom/styles provided by other packages.\nAll in all it sounds a bit messy and dirty but I can't think of another possibility opening Grappelli to Django-related packages.\n. @blueyed Okay, let's add #container and .form-row. Can you provide a patch for that?\n. added following id/classes: #container .inline-group .inline-related .tabular .module .form-row .field-box\n. ~~That's the default behaviour, see http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#buttonbar~~\nEdit: Sorry, my fault, there's a custom behaviour. Should be fixed with bb6c205e8c756ad54ae87d8d71118654312263e9\n. The branding block is back (in base.html). It's empty by default but I commented out a div#grp-branding which can be used to place elements on the left-hand side of the h1#grp-admin-title. Of course you can fill it with other elements, too.\n. grappelli 2.6.x is not compatible with django 1.6, see #516 \n. That's true, but was never intended. The GRAPPELLI_ADMIN_TITLE is only shown at the upper left side (with the global navigation bar).\n. ... but we take a look at replacing the default admin title with the GRAPPELLI_ADMIN_TITLE\n. I'll take a look at that, although it's a fussy issue \u2013 might take some time as I have to figure out user-selects in different contexts (we don't want to loose visible selections everywhere).\n. Thanks for reporting\n. yes, it's going to be in 2.5.6 (might take some time).\nif you need it now, check out the current 2.5.x branch.\n. grappelli 2.6.x is not compatible with django 1.6, see #516\n. When we integrated TinyMCE we focussed on features which seemed important to be editable via a text editor. We did icons for those features only (also see #293, #492 ).\nFeel free if you want to add the table icons, a patch would be welcome.\n. Thanks, that's a good idea IMO. I established some new blocks which make it easy to flexibly customize the header or parts of it: \n{% block header %} (the header as a whole, including als sub-elements), \n{% block navigation %} (the navigation, including all sub-elements), \n{% block user-tools %} (the user-tools with sub-elements),\n{% block context-navigation %} (the context-navigation including breadcrumbs and page-tools).\n. Cannot reproduce that either. It's strange that there's a second item at all.\n@epicserve Can you possibly find out where this second item is located in the dom structure?\n. Let's implement a submit button\n. Can't reproduce this with the the latest Chromium 41.0.2271.0 (64-bit) OS X (I'm not able to test Version 37.0.2062.120 Built on Ubuntu 12.04, running on elementary OS 0.2.1 (281580) (64-bit)).\nClosing this, you might try other releases and get back with more information (please include grappelli version then, too).\n. Well, to be honest I think there's something wrong with your setup.\nIt works fine in Chrome 39.0.2171.95 (64-bit) on OS X Mavericks for me (and ever did).\nDid you check if /static/admin/js/actions.js is loaded? I can reproduce the error if that's not the case...\n. And you might take a look at https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/214\n. thanks for reporting, should be solved.\n. @lzanuz Yes, it worked for me. I could reproduce this with IE9/10 \u2014 if you take a look at the a.grp-button.grp-pulldown-handler of the filter menu, it should have a background-size: auto !important. Switching that property off brings back the problem.\n. @lzanuz If it's still -webkit-background-size you've got the outdated css-files (take a look at fad72b8e88a50ed392a9db5a99438257cfef8f71). The changes are not yet merged to the master, did you check out stable 2.6.x?\n. @lzanuz stable is okay (master is preferred, but as mentioned it's not merged into that right now).\n. You're welcome @lzanuz\n. thanks for reporting\n. Sorry, can't reproduce this. Dou you have a screenshot and more information (browser etc.)?\n. Thanks for additional info, fixed it (stable/2.6.x, stable/2.5.x) assigning white-space: pre-wrap\n. @micrypt Did you check the new footer z-index it with all other z-indizes throughout?\n. @micrypt Just have to check some possible interferences. What's the z-index of the map? I don't have any GeoDjango stuff installed so let's find out theoretically.\n. @micrypt Can you tell me the z-index of the map?\n. @micrypt That can't be: z-index 0 can't overlap z-index 900 (as the footer was positioned before your patch), can you take a second look maybe at ohter elements wrapping the map and having z-indices?\n. @micrypt Right, thanks for clarifying. If we don't know the highest possible z-index it's a bit dangerous to operate with just something, I don't want to carelessly adjust z-indizes as some other features depend on that. \n. @k1-hedayati Can you post a screenshot showing where that custom views box should be positioned?\n. Where it should be positioned correctly in the end \u2014 is it below the other apps or in a smaller sidebar?\n. let me have a look at this before working on a pr\n. @ngzhian I'm not sure why your top navigation bar is 52px tall \u2013 did you apply any custom styles to it? Your ul#grp-user-tools on the righthand side must also suffer from that taller height, right?\n. allright\n. @c-nichols Can't verify that problem (looks okay in my local environment using the same setup). I'm able to force this only if I lower the width of .selector (from given 758px to < 758px). Are you sure there are no custom styles of yours? You might also try playing around with the width of that .selector (via web developer tools) and provide some more information on that problem.\n\n. Closing this as no further information was provided and issue couldn't be verified.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. We chose to hide that headline because showing it reduces the clarity/readability of the tabular layout.\n. @ngzhian currently not (we wanted to leave it in there for e.g use with document outlines etc.)\n. Please use the google group for asking questions (this is an issue tracker).\nBasically you have to add a custom datepicker-js by using a Media inner class on your ModelAdmin (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-media-definitions).\nA description and example file can be found here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/django-grappelli/datepicker/django-grappelli/nPZe74hR9NE/I_mOY9gZjGsJ\n. @menarguez Seems you customized your admin title, right? If so, you'll have to customize the styles, too.\n. Closing this, as issue couldn't be verified and no further information has been provided.\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. @lzanuz which os/browser are you using?\n. Thank you! I'll take a look at that...\n. Seems to be a Django bug: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22955\n. @niorko When I disable Grappelli (Djano only) I get the same behaviour...\n. Might be an issue with the cache of SelectBox.js as the misbehaviour doesn't appear if the page is reloaded with overriding the cache (cmd+shift+r OSX)\n. @oelium Sorry, cannot find\"load url from future\" or  \"future\" in any of the grappelli 2.7.x templates and surely not on the lines (53) mentioned above. Can you specify that issue?\n. Though IMO the printed layout doesn't get much better with media=\"all\" instead of media=\"screen\", there's no reason why we shouldn't use it until we might have specific print styles.\n. Thanks for reporting\n. @jpotterm I like both your proposals (removing the changelink, simplifying the addlink). Before submitting a pr, please make sure that different user permission scenarios are still satisfied.\n. Don't think that's related to Grappelli, find in files isn't able to find an icon_calendar.gif. @robslotboom do you have any custom installations/packages, e.g. of jQuery UI?\n. The file \n[21/Dec/2015 12:37:46]\"GET /static/admin/js/admin/DateTimeShortcuts.js HTTP/1.1\" 200 69\nhas to be empty besides some comments explaining that Grappelli has dropped the contents of it and only keeps this empty file to prevent 404 errors. Can you take a look at this file? If it's not empty it's the original Django one and there's something wrong with your setup then.\n. Just to let you know: we're not working on that officially nor do we know about any contributors working on that.\n. @pista329 oops, thanks for reporting, fixed it.\n. Thanks for reporting & fixing it!\n. Thanks for reporting & fixing it!\n. Thanks for reporting, fixed in stable 2.7.x and 2.8.x branches\n. Works with my comparable setup (and there have been no reports concerning such a misbehaviour). Did you check if the scripts are loaded correctly?\n. Thanks for reporting, spread it to branches (stable 2.8.x via 789e920ce3ee6fcf6d2f4c98209dc8f2530c8e18 and stable 2.7.x via f25543c4d17b63541f5c68d69b1f31c955b9e8a4)\n. Well, it's easy if you don't use Grappelli but the original Django 1.9. styles if you like them.\n. Using Grappelli's functionality without it's styles is not possible.\n. Please note that Grappelli 2.7.3 is not compatible with Django 1.9, you should use the 2.8 development branch (https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli#releases)\nFurthermore the height works well in my environment but you're talking about an \"add\" button \u2013 do you have any customizations implemented?\n. Implemented suggested changes (didn't test them).\n. Thanks for reporting. I defined grp-container as class using container as only ID (providing compatibility, see #494).\n. @utapyngo As I'm not able to set up constance right now: can you please check if adding {% load static %} solves the problem or if there are further requirements (we're usually using a {{ STATIC_URL }}). Happy to integrate it then.\n. Thank you.\n. see #752\n. So you did define <h1 id=\"site-name\"><a href=\"{% url 'admin:index' %}\">CMDB</a></h1> in templates/admin/base_site.html?\nIf yes, you end up with two <h1> (not a good thing) and of course you have to apply styles to your custom heading.\nIf no, please let me know where this <h1 id=\"site-name\"> might come from, I can't reproduce it.\n. Yes, maybe that's not very clear that you shouldn't use <h1 id=\"site-name\">.\nUsing the {% block branding %} you can define/insert whatever you want, of course you have to take care about the styles on your on behalf. As suggested in the comment of {% block branding %} you can use <div id=\"grp-branding\"> as a container for a logo or whatsoever, it's positioned correctly. But you will have to apply some styles on your own, too, as there's no way to guess how people use the branding block.\n. @ArtemBernatskyy Can you please check if this is solved with ede5b66 (or similar to #737)?\n. The suggested solution you cited is not the one I used in the end. You should check out https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/stable/2.8.x (the commit ede5b66 contains the changes fixing #737), or at least get the screen.css of ede5b66\n. already fixed in #753 \n. The styling issue 1 comes from <div class=\"grp-loader\" style=\"display: none;\">loader</div>&nbsp;<strong>Network - Syndicated</strong>, there should definitely be no <strong>. I have no idea where this might come from. Can you provide the HTML of the second example, too?\n. Thanks for reporting \u2013 and fixing it!\n. @MikeVL Since I'm not using django-constance: I assume your mods are tested, right? Because I'll implement them in the 2.7.x-2.9.x Grappelli versions as they are. Please confirm.\n. @MikeVL Thanks for confirming \u2013 and the patch.\n. @rcooke Is it an option to use a description (instead of help texts)? See #216 . @ArtemBernatskyy Can't verify that, works fine with my setup. Do you use any customized versions (of the dashboard)?. @dahfool besides you're right, which way do you apply your custom css?. @dahfool I tested overriding selectors the way you're implementing the custom css and that works fine \u2014 but you're absolutely right that the css contains some unnecessary nestings. I flattended some of them, but it's currently not possible to go over all css hierarchies.. @dahfool I'm personally not a huge fan of smacss or bem (nor have they been popular when Grappelli's css base has been set up) but I totally agree on following modern guidelines for writing flat, minimal and maintainable css. Unfortunately there's not much time left for overhauling everything right now, but I'll definitely keep that in mind for possible future updates.. looks good. @sehmaschine: autocompletes should be focused when clicking their labels\n. autocomplete css have to be distributed to certain css-files before the autocompletes are released\n. @sehmaschine: yes, we might think about distinguishing the search-icons but then we have to have more different search-icons (also for filebrowse-fields). right now the search-icon does not rely to the type of the field it is associated with but just illustrates the action of opening some sort of changelist in a popup-window. \n. added predefined layout for changelist with filters in a sidebar.\n. thanks for reporting, should be fixed with 2 commits in the autocomplete branch:\ncommit 001db4ec75fd9ca16cc97176b6e4a8a6efb78cbd\ncommit 54bc70d155ed0c5b95e628f76e909c62bba62202\n. I just want to mention (as we discussed that point often before) that it is not possible to cover Grappelli with Bootstrap only. We would need a lot of additional/custom DOM and CSS to maintain the current possibilities of Grappelli.\n. @LeonardoGentile that's clear anyway... I just want to avoid heavy dependencies, css-mingle-mangle, using something as an alleged base which then has to be widely adapted. I generally don't refuse the idea of using Bootstrap, just pointing out my concerns.\n. @BertrandBordage First of all thanks for exploring that case. Based on experiences, I think your estimated hours meet the minimum efforts. Maybe you can give more detailed and actual descriptions of what you are working on, we will try our best to support possible questions on the fly. In my opinion an accurate layout of requirements dom- and css-wise, in combination with a projected dividing line between bootstrap and customs, could give a more precise idea of what has to be done.\n. @nym sorry, this issue has been closed for several reasons, mentioning two main important ones:\n1) the boostrap-issue has been discussed a lot, we always expressed our concerns about possibilities to base grappelli on bootstrap (reminder: you'll be able to implement/transfer 80% right away, but you'll fail when it comes to the last 20% and grappelli is about the last 20%). no one came up with a consistent solution that far, but feel free to surprise us ...\n2) the future of grappelli has to be something different than bootstrap, as bootstrap is quite outdated when it comes to modern frontend frameworks/technologies.\n. solved with 5134e3bd90cc840e79eb55a488548f0e2fa1e572\n. solved with d174682bbc1714bc071dbe4d29df705d5239c2e7\nof course the height of .selector-available and .selector-chosen differs if there's a multiline text in .selector-filter. that might be solved when using compass...\n. we'll take a look at that, thanks\n. this issue depends on  line 258 of tabular.html where we have to toggle the the .module.table twice to prevent webkit browsers from applying the border-spacing at wrong positions during dragging.\nwe have to do some research to find a smart solution for that.\n. the geoadmin icons will be supplied with the next release of grappelli\n. yes, I will supply them for older releases as well...\nand I'm reopening the issue (just to keep it in mind).\n. @sehmaschine: you are right \u2013 collectstatic collects the original admin images into the static folder. the gis-images are there...\n. also works with Grappelli 2.3\n. we'll take a look at that when releasing grappelli 2.4\n. The overflow:hidden is in there because it's needed when you got cells in a row. I moved the overflow:hidden to .row.cells which might solve your problem temporarily and will review the whole construction while working on grappelli 2.4, see #99\n. it's not there for clearfixing something, it's necessary to hide the vertical borders of .cells in .rows which have to overflow the height of the .rows (but you should not see the overflow) \u2013 however, a bit complicated. i will review that during the development of grappelli 2.4 and distribute a solution to 2.3 if i find one\n. @kylemacfarlane: thanks for reporting, didn't notice that it's used with the login-page...\n. ul.radiolist / ul.checkboxlist (both +inline)\n. a.related-lookup\n. elements mentioned in this ticket can't be namespaced\n. sorry for delay, simply have overseen that. should work now.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this/follow you, can you please provide some example or screenshot?\n. @iperatoner: can you also tell me which browser/os you are using?\n. thanks for reporting, should work now\n. components.css is not used with Grappelli 2.4 (checked the selectors there and they seem okay)\n. thanks for reporting, fixed it without patch because it has some dependencies\n. On the one hand you are right: Images like that have been \"replaced\" with Grappelli 2.3.8-\nThat did not happen with Grappelli 2.4 until now, that's why I applied the commit above.\nOn the other hand I don't get your point with css/buttons.css and js/SelectFilter2.js as they are not used in Grappelli 2.4\n. okay, that's what I thought. But you can't use Grappelli 2.3.8 with Django 1.4 anyway: http://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n. @lauritzen: should work now...\n. @lauritzen you're welcome, thanks for reporting (and making me search for a cleaner solution)\n. no, that wasn't a design decision. the dashboard should of course show multiple columns as it ever did.\n. yes, you are right, the dashboard-files were missing the last changes... I've updated them, smaller fixes according styles will follow\n. @sehmaschine: collapse is not working with the dashboard (though the classes are there)\n. think that happended especially with field in grp-cells, should work now (otherwise please reopen this issue)\n. yes, that's because I changed the g-d-fluid classes (maybe we have to improve that but with a better solution then...)\n. working on that right now...\n. I know, display states and js seem to be broken/confusing...\n. works fine for me (selecting/unselecting all, rows going yellow, actions for multiple objects...). have you done a collectstatic?\n. ad 1) why?\nad 2) that's too greyish for my taste\nad 3) I would not unify the headings but we may increase the font-size of labels \u2013 on the other hand we need small font-sizes expecially in changelists\n. +1 for that as everything within Grappelli which could be namespaced should be namespaced \u2013 why refer to Django when you are dealing with Grappelli\n. thanks for reporting, fixed it\n. this is a grappelli issue (actually a tinymce issue within grappelli) - there's an issue: https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/167\n. the supported tinymce-plugins should be styled now.\n. Works fine for me. Are you sure you are using Grappelli 2.4?\n. There's a branch for Grappelli 2.4 (https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/grappelli_2_4). It's almost finished and will hopefully be released next week.\n. I don't quite understand what happened here: Can you please provide more info about your static-files setting? And why do you use a symbolic link? Which files haven been overridden?\nBasically a collectstatic with Grappelli should only collect the Grappelli-static-files. As we do not serve any django-based static files (beside some js) I'm wondering how that could override your django admin files (as colletstatic adds files and usually not overrides them).\n. we still need the general min-width of modules because of its possible contents but I excluded the submit-rows from that\n. ad 1) Fields defined as readonly are delivered as  \u2013 I'm not sure if you mean that...\nad grp-help) I cannot reproduce helptexts above widgets (SelectBox.js), please provide more information (code/screenshot)\n. Just wondering how you get the helptext above the selectors as we remove it in SelectFilters2.js\nShould be working now.\n. Okay, thought something like that. If you want you may provide your improvements...\n. I added the experimental svg-support for IE9. Please note, that Grappelli isn't tested with non-standard-compliant browsers (and we also do not support IE8 and lower because of poor CSS3 and HTML5 capabilities).\n. I can't reproduce this \u2013 looks well in my IE9 (and should have been fixed with 320b73ab5d7eabf5775f8ba39d666dfbc44ef44b).\nI got the SVG background and the sprite.\n. To use background-image is not always possible as I dynamically combine background-gradients and background-images (combinations of gradients and icons). And about the SVG/gradient fallback: I'm sorry but most of modern browsers support at least one of that and we are not going to begin writing fallbacks.\n. I think this is duplicate and already was fixed, see #113. Please make sure you got the commit and collected the static. If the problem still exists the please reopen the ticket.\n. should be fixed with 320b73ab5d7eabf5775f8ba39d666dfbc44ef44b, see also #178\n. thanks for reporting, fixed it.\n. @lboaretto: beside changing \"grappelli/stylesheets/partials/custom/tinymce.css\" you also have to update \"grappelli/stylesheets/screen.css\" as it contains selectors for those buttons\n. I applied another fix, hope it works for you and strongly recommend that you update your browser (as Grappelli is tested with Firefox 14.0+)\n. @lboaretto: Your screenshot shows that you must be definitely missing some styles as there is a button but no icon. With my Firefox 15.0 everything looks fine (there is an icon and the button is at the right place). Don't know... Did you collect your static files?\n. Compass creates sprite images on the fly which means that their names might change from time to time. You have to get the new icons-sprite. Why don't you just check out Grappellis stable/2.4.x branch \u2013 all recent changes are in there.\n. thanks for reporting. should work now.\n. RTL styles for TinyMCE are not working properly: Some could be fixed but beside that there are crticial points where the DOM is a problem, e.g. with the .mceListBox (dropdown menu for styles, fonts etc.)\nI'm not sure if we are going to implement an RTL-version of TinyMCE.\n. As there was no further feedback concerning the rtl-styles I close this issue.\n. yes\n. Something must be broken in the DOM of your changelist as it should definitely look like the first screenshot on http://www.grappelliproject.com/ (even without date-hierarchy). Did you customize anything? Can you take a look at the dom (especially for elements not being closed)?\n. The missing backgrounds have been fixed (see #178). Which IE are you using?\n. We'll take a look at that.\n. After trying some things out we decided to postpone that. Basically I like the idea of those tooltip-helptexts but I don't like that they would work very different than all other helptexts (introduce a new behaviour).\nBesides that it can be recommended to use a description if you want to avoid repeating long helptexts.\nI leave this issue open as we might come back to that.\n. I'll take a look at.\n. I tested this issue in Grappelli 2.4.2 with a multiline helptext for a charField in a tabular inline and cannot reproduce it.\nThe p.grp-help has a \"max-width: 278px\" there and also the inherited \"white-space:nowrap\" is overwritten by a \"white-space:normal !important\".\nWhat Grappelli version are you using/talking about? Which Browser/OS?\n. Never mind the mistake. Thanks for pointing to the concerned CSS. I made some changes to solve the mentioned 2 problems, hope it works for you (tested it on Chrome/Safari/Firefox/IE9).\n. @sehmaschine: it's also not necessary to have that sentence twice. we should remove one (either the pre_content of dashboard/modules.py line 348 or the else-clause of dashboard/modules/recent_actions.html line17f).\n. @sehmaschine: +1 for covering such minor fallbacks... They should be placed in django-resets.scss as this refers to                                            erything concerning the original Django.\n. Can you be more specific? \n. I am sorry, but your screenshots are far beyond known minor rendering issues in IE8/9. As I assume that you cleared your cache, collected static files etc. I just got one guess left: Is your IE running in that strange mode where it behaves like an older version of itself?\n. I'm afraid that we won't be able to solve the mentioned issues with IE8.\nWe do not provide any html5shim/v javascript (that would be easy) but also the $experimental-support-for-svg: truedoesn't work with IE8. Furthermore we use some layout-props which are not understood by IE8.\n. Actually they should have the same height. What browser are you using?\n. I took a closer look at that: The height of the second box is calculated and assigned by js (admin/js/admin/SelectFilter2.js line 102 and following). As there occured some inaccuracies according different browsers I assigned fixed heights and skipped the whole js-calculation.\n. Adding a height is not a good solution. The timepicker should rather be openend to the top (like datepickers do in that case).\n. The styles for selecting month/year in date widget have already been there, I improved them a bit.\nIf you want to use such a datepicker (with custom/different options) you have to load a custom js.\n. @lvelezsantos: Just want to let you know that there's a related question and some advice on how to implement a customized datepicker, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/django-grappelli/nPZe74hR9NE\n. when reporting an issue you have to give more accurate details: which functions in which context are not working in your opinion?\n. @doganmeh Grappelli is based on a very different grid system, on which allows controlling horizontal and vertical spacings throughout the whole design process, see http://muellergridsystem.com/ \n. fixed with 9f396116125d7c139524b6cd193fd477ef7faca6\n. basically yes, testing would be appreciated.\n@floledermann: can you try the last commit?\n. thanks!\n. set vertical-align: top; for some form fields. still has to be tested with all combinations.\n. test results seem to be ok\n. it's the mark_safe: it returns paragraphs in the mentioned case and as the grp-readonly is a paragraph itself the visible output fails.\nwe are going to change the p.grp-readonly to a div.grp-readonly\n. I would not change the process of clicking the cross and marking a line as being deleted on save. That's what a user has to understand (and that wouldn't be obvious if a line disappears immediately). We discussed the styles before (reducing opacities, different colors, icon changes, ...) but came to no better solution. If there are any suggestions of how to improve those styles then let me know please.\n. which OS/browser?\n. I added the pagebreak (as an example of how to use the customizable files/folders, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/django-grappelli/VMIZRLfmd6Q).\n. @alexander-ae: Please put your custom styles into the files/folders mentioned here: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/django-grappelli/VMIZRLfmd6Q\n. thanks for reporting\n. All those fields (independent of their possible types) are \"hidden\" via some class now. Testing is appreciated.\n. thanks, you're right, I refined it.\n. should work now\n. thanks for reporting @paramburu \n. Thanks for reporting, I'll take a look at that.\nAm Freitag, 22.

The add-button is hidden via jquery.grp_inline.js depending on TOTAL_FORMS and MAX_NUM_FORMS (it's not asking for permissions there). Anyway, the hidden add-button with display: none was still visible as grp-tools items in .gpr-closed need the property display: block !important. I fixed that via css with really hiding such hidden buttons.\n. Thanks for reporting, I take a look at that. Might be related to #316.\n. thanks for reporting, fixed it with the suggested change to position: relative\n. I added the suggested styles by myself as there are changes to the alterative changelist-template according to that: First we check if there's an overflow and then add a class which handels the overflow.\n. I raised the padding-right for form fields followed by a button (lowering the padding would break the grid): That applies to datepicker-fields, timepicker-fields, fields with a generic lookup (related, fk, m2m) and filebrowse-fields.\n. A custom width should not affect the behaviour of such an input-field, as its padding remains the same (24px, which is the width of the button overlapping the field).\n. I moved the included header.html back to base.html\nOverriding/extending {% block userlinks %} and {% block nav-global %} should work again.\nFurthermore I had to change some password-change templates which doubled the userlinks.\n. @benebun Yes, I'm keeping an eye on that issue\n. Hi Johannes, thanks for sharing your work, we'll take a closer look (quite busy right now).\n. @sehmaschine the images should be found now\n. Unfortunately we can not provide any wording change.\nI altered the colors (there should be slightly more contrast now) and provided an extra icon. \n. +1 for that. we'll have a thought on how this might look.\n. IMO such a block would only work, if it appeared only one time per page. as there might be multiple stacked inlines such a block would cause an error. I think it would be best to define a custom jquery function which inserts the \"onAfterAdded\" to a specific stacked inline.\n. Can you give me a short explanation why it is more difficult to customize the user actions using {% block userlinks %} right now?\n. Ok, I think I get your point. We have to think about a solution (considering #335 extending blocks in includes is not possible) how to solve that. If you have any idea, let me know.\n. In case you want to override a block only, you are not able to access blocks within the include from outside, see #335\n. I favor the idea of using different blocks to customize parts of the header (#538), which would not be possible if the header was an include. Therefore I removed the obsolete header includes.\n. I modified the selectors, should work with CachedStaticFilesStorage now \u2013 testing is appreciated. \nSee 4f0ca2a0949eb1484f06e2f80ad5b4a8b9ceb750\n. @morlandi Thanks for fixing\n. thanks for reporting, should work now\n. Since we use Github as an issue tracker and furthermore this question is not related to Grappelli I'm closing this.\nPlease use other ways to ask questions concerning django.\n. As this is an issue-tracker (and I'm not sure whether your are describing a bug or asking a question), I would ask you to post your problem to the google group https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!forum/django-grappelli \u2013 it might be answered faster there\n. thanks for reporting\n. I changed the css as it seems to be more reasonable than deleting html-elements.\n. We didn't yet find a way to translate the datepicker ( #318 , #5 ) \u2013 the only solution for now is to add your custom translation by using a Media inner class on your ModelAdmin (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-media-definitions).\n. As mentioned before you could e.g. also use \n\n```\nclass MyModel(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    ...\nclass Media:\n    js = [\n        \"/PATH_TO_YOUR/custom.ui.datepicker-it.js\",\n    ]\n\n```\nWhy should we collect translations in the meantime? They are all there (jQuery UI)...\n. @nebstrebor thanks for preparing this.\nFor now it works in debug mode only as @sehmaschine the JS files have to be minified again.\n. @nebstrebor thanks for preparing this.\nFor now it works in debug mode only as @sehmaschine the JS files have to be minified again.\n. thanks for reporting\n. There is no change_form_top_model.html with Grappelli.\n. This would result in an empty <ul  class=\"grp-object-tools\"> if a user has no add-permission and there are no third-party buttons. I'll take a look at that.\n. fixed with c1178727098ed3f3ca50da82c18db8e189b64212 (see also a1d3ff0707ea16795c576a1640d304e32dfe9766)\n. This is a problem in which context?\n. Which version of django and grappelli?\n. What sort of custom widget do you use? How is ist defined?\n. As there are no <input type=\"button\" /> with Django/Grappelli (at least I couldn't find any having a peek), I disabled them extending grp-icon-button. That declaration was moved to tinyMCE's namespace as there might be use cases with tinyMCE.\n@pauliuszaleckas Does that work for you?\n. I made some style changes to make the <input type=\"button\" /> look similar like a grp-icon-button\n. I partially agree with 2&3: I separated values by commas and added a strike-through for the pre-remove state. Think that's enough \u2013 distinctive blocks, \"X\" etc. are way too much emphasize imo.\n. Those images are already there: https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/grappelli_2_4/grappelli/static/grappelli/jquery/ui/css/custom-theme/images\nCan you provide additional information?\n. The \"standard\" django dashboard has just 2 columns. You can define a custom dashboard with grappelli, then you will have 3 columns and be able to place single apps/modules within certain columns. If you need more than 3 columns you have to write your own dashboard template.\nhttp://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dashboard_setup.html#custom-dashboard\nhttp://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dashboard_api.html\n. I'll have a look at that, might be related to #405 \n. I just tested with Grappelli (dev/2.6.x) using Django 1.7b4 (Chrome/Safari/Firefox) and I'm not able to reproduce this.\nCan you check again and provide additional information?\n. okay, don't worry\n. Some thoughts:\nIf we use all original classes in addition, it's going to be messy, of course. Using a selection only makes not much sense imo as we don't know which classnames for which packages might be needed.\nFurther we changed some dom-structures with Grappelli which might cause incompatibilities too (even if there are original classnames).\nIt would be some hours of work to reassign all those original classnames in addition to the grp ones. Basically there should be no visual interferences as Grappelli doesn't deliver Django's original stylesheets. There will be visual interferences with dom/styles provided by other packages.\nAll in all it sounds a bit messy and dirty but I can't think of another possibility opening Grappelli to Django-related packages.\n. @blueyed Okay, let's add #container and .form-row. Can you provide a patch for that?\n. added following id/classes: #container .inline-group .inline-related .tabular .module .form-row .field-box\n. ~~That's the default behaviour, see http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#buttonbar~~\nEdit: Sorry, my fault, there's a custom behaviour. Should be fixed with bb6c205e8c756ad54ae87d8d71118654312263e9\n. The branding block is back (in base.html). It's empty by default but I commented out a div#grp-branding which can be used to place elements on the left-hand side of the h1#grp-admin-title. Of course you can fill it with other elements, too.\n. grappelli 2.6.x is not compatible with django 1.6, see #516 \n. That's true, but was never intended. The GRAPPELLI_ADMIN_TITLE is only shown at the upper left side (with the global navigation bar).\n. ... but we take a look at replacing the default admin title with the GRAPPELLI_ADMIN_TITLE\n. I'll take a look at that, although it's a fussy issue \u2013 might take some time as I have to figure out user-selects in different contexts (we don't want to loose visible selections everywhere).\n. Thanks for reporting\n. yes, it's going to be in 2.5.6 (might take some time).\nif you need it now, check out the current 2.5.x branch.\n. grappelli 2.6.x is not compatible with django 1.6, see #516\n. When we integrated TinyMCE we focussed on features which seemed important to be editable via a text editor. We did icons for those features only (also see #293, #492 ).\nFeel free if you want to add the table icons, a patch would be welcome.\n. Thanks, that's a good idea IMO. I established some new blocks which make it easy to flexibly customize the header or parts of it: \n{% block header %} (the header as a whole, including als sub-elements), \n{% block navigation %} (the navigation, including all sub-elements), \n{% block user-tools %} (the user-tools with sub-elements),\n{% block context-navigation %} (the context-navigation including breadcrumbs and page-tools).\n. Cannot reproduce that either. It's strange that there's a second item at all.\n@epicserve Can you possibly find out where this second item is located in the dom structure?\n. Let's implement a submit button\n. Can't reproduce this with the the latest Chromium 41.0.2271.0 (64-bit) OS X (I'm not able to test Version 37.0.2062.120 Built on Ubuntu 12.04, running on elementary OS 0.2.1 (281580) (64-bit)).\nClosing this, you might try other releases and get back with more information (please include grappelli version then, too).\n. Well, to be honest I think there's something wrong with your setup.\nIt works fine in Chrome 39.0.2171.95 (64-bit) on OS X Mavericks for me (and ever did).\nDid you check if /static/admin/js/actions.js is loaded? I can reproduce the error if that's not the case...\n. And you might take a look at https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/214\n. thanks for reporting, should be solved.\n. @lzanuz Yes, it worked for me. I could reproduce this with IE9/10 \u2014 if you take a look at the a.grp-button.grp-pulldown-handler of the filter menu, it should have a background-size: auto !important. Switching that property off brings back the problem.\n. @lzanuz If it's still -webkit-background-size you've got the outdated css-files (take a look at fad72b8e88a50ed392a9db5a99438257cfef8f71). The changes are not yet merged to the master, did you check out stable 2.6.x?\n. @lzanuz stable is okay (master is preferred, but as mentioned it's not merged into that right now).\n. You're welcome @lzanuz\n. thanks for reporting\n. Sorry, can't reproduce this. Dou you have a screenshot and more information (browser etc.)?\n. Thanks for additional info, fixed it (stable/2.6.x, stable/2.5.x) assigning white-space: pre-wrap\n. @micrypt Did you check the new footer z-index it with all other z-indizes throughout?\n. @micrypt Just have to check some possible interferences. What's the z-index of the map? I don't have any GeoDjango stuff installed so let's find out theoretically.\n. @micrypt Can you tell me the z-index of the map?\n. @micrypt That can't be: z-index 0 can't overlap z-index 900 (as the footer was positioned before your patch), can you take a second look maybe at ohter elements wrapping the map and having z-indices?\n. @micrypt Right, thanks for clarifying. If we don't know the highest possible z-index it's a bit dangerous to operate with just something, I don't want to carelessly adjust z-indizes as some other features depend on that. \n. @k1-hedayati Can you post a screenshot showing where that custom views box should be positioned?\n. Where it should be positioned correctly in the end \u2014 is it below the other apps or in a smaller sidebar?\n. let me have a look at this before working on a pr\n. @ngzhian I'm not sure why your top navigation bar is 52px tall \u2013 did you apply any custom styles to it? Your ul#grp-user-tools on the righthand side must also suffer from that taller height, right?\n. allright\n. @c-nichols Can't verify that problem (looks okay in my local environment using the same setup). I'm able to force this only if I lower the width of .selector (from given 758px to < 758px). Are you sure there are no custom styles of yours? You might also try playing around with the width of that .selector (via web developer tools) and provide some more information on that problem.\n\n. Closing this as no further information was provided and issue couldn't be verified.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. We chose to hide that headline because showing it reduces the clarity/readability of the tabular layout.\n. @ngzhian currently not (we wanted to leave it in there for e.g use with document outlines etc.)\n. Please use the google group for asking questions (this is an issue tracker).\nBasically you have to add a custom datepicker-js by using a Media inner class on your ModelAdmin (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-media-definitions).\nA description and example file can be found here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/django-grappelli/datepicker/django-grappelli/nPZe74hR9NE/I_mOY9gZjGsJ\n. @menarguez Seems you customized your admin title, right? If so, you'll have to customize the styles, too.\n. Closing this, as issue couldn't be verified and no further information has been provided.\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. @lzanuz which os/browser are you using?\n. Thank you! I'll take a look at that...\n. Seems to be a Django bug: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22955\n. @niorko When I disable Grappelli (Djano only) I get the same behaviour...\n. Might be an issue with the cache of SelectBox.js as the misbehaviour doesn't appear if the page is reloaded with overriding the cache (cmd+shift+r OSX)\n. @oelium Sorry, cannot find\"load url from future\" or  \"future\" in any of the grappelli 2.7.x templates and surely not on the lines (53) mentioned above. Can you specify that issue?\n. Though IMO the printed layout doesn't get much better with media=\"all\" instead of media=\"screen\", there's no reason why we shouldn't use it until we might have specific print styles.\n. Thanks for reporting\n. @jpotterm I like both your proposals (removing the changelink, simplifying the addlink). Before submitting a pr, please make sure that different user permission scenarios are still satisfied.\n. Don't think that's related to Grappelli, find in files isn't able to find an icon_calendar.gif. @robslotboom do you have any custom installations/packages, e.g. of jQuery UI?\n. The file \n[21/Dec/2015 12:37:46]\"GET /static/admin/js/admin/DateTimeShortcuts.js HTTP/1.1\" 200 69\nhas to be empty besides some comments explaining that Grappelli has dropped the contents of it and only keeps this empty file to prevent 404 errors. Can you take a look at this file? If it's not empty it's the original Django one and there's something wrong with your setup then.\n. Just to let you know: we're not working on that officially nor do we know about any contributors working on that.\n. @pista329 oops, thanks for reporting, fixed it.\n. Thanks for reporting & fixing it!\n. Thanks for reporting & fixing it!\n. Thanks for reporting, fixed in stable 2.7.x and 2.8.x branches\n. Works with my comparable setup (and there have been no reports concerning such a misbehaviour). Did you check if the scripts are loaded correctly?\n. Thanks for reporting, spread it to branches (stable 2.8.x via 789e920ce3ee6fcf6d2f4c98209dc8f2530c8e18 and stable 2.7.x via f25543c4d17b63541f5c68d69b1f31c955b9e8a4)\n. Well, it's easy if you don't use Grappelli but the original Django 1.9. styles if you like them.\n. Using Grappelli's functionality without it's styles is not possible.\n. Please note that Grappelli 2.7.3 is not compatible with Django 1.9, you should use the 2.8 development branch (https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli#releases)\nFurthermore the height works well in my environment but you're talking about an \"add\" button \u2013 do you have any customizations implemented?\n. Implemented suggested changes (didn't test them).\n. Thanks for reporting. I defined grp-container as class using container as only ID (providing compatibility, see #494).\n. @utapyngo As I'm not able to set up constance right now: can you please check if adding {% load static %} solves the problem or if there are further requirements (we're usually using a {{ STATIC_URL }}). Happy to integrate it then.\n. Thank you.\n. see #752\n. So you did define <h1 id=\"site-name\"><a href=\"{% url 'admin:index' %}\">CMDB</a></h1> in templates/admin/base_site.html?\nIf yes, you end up with two <h1> (not a good thing) and of course you have to apply styles to your custom heading.\nIf no, please let me know where this <h1 id=\"site-name\"> might come from, I can't reproduce it.\n. Yes, maybe that's not very clear that you shouldn't use <h1 id=\"site-name\">.\nUsing the {% block branding %} you can define/insert whatever you want, of course you have to take care about the styles on your on behalf. As suggested in the comment of {% block branding %} you can use <div id=\"grp-branding\"> as a container for a logo or whatsoever, it's positioned correctly. But you will have to apply some styles on your own, too, as there's no way to guess how people use the branding block.\n. @ArtemBernatskyy Can you please check if this is solved with ede5b66 (or similar to #737)?\n. The suggested solution you cited is not the one I used in the end. You should check out https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/tree/stable/2.8.x (the commit ede5b66 contains the changes fixing #737), or at least get the screen.css of ede5b66\n. already fixed in #753 \n. The styling issue 1 comes from <div class=\"grp-loader\" style=\"display: none;\">loader</div>&nbsp;<strong>Network - Syndicated</strong>, there should definitely be no <strong>. I have no idea where this might come from. Can you provide the HTML of the second example, too?\n. Thanks for reporting \u2013 and fixing it!\n. @MikeVL Since I'm not using django-constance: I assume your mods are tested, right? Because I'll implement them in the 2.7.x-2.9.x Grappelli versions as they are. Please confirm.\n. @MikeVL Thanks for confirming \u2013 and the patch.\n. @rcooke Is it an option to use a description (instead of help texts)? See #216 . @ArtemBernatskyy Can't verify that, works fine with my setup. Do you use any customized versions (of the dashboard)?. @dahfool besides you're right, which way do you apply your custom css?. @dahfool I tested overriding selectors the way you're implementing the custom css and that works fine \u2014 but you're absolutely right that the css contains some unnecessary nestings. I flattended some of them, but it's currently not possible to go over all css hierarchies.. @dahfool I'm personally not a huge fan of smacss or bem (nor have they been popular when Grappelli's css base has been set up) but I totally agree on following modern guidelines for writing flat, minimal and maintainable css. Unfortunately there's not much time left for overhauling everything right now, but I'll definitely keep that in mind for possible future updates.. looks good. ",
    "BertrandBordage": "We could add the list of available languages to the context of the view, then:\n{% if LANGUAGE_CODE in datepicker_available_languages %}\n  ....\n{% endif %}\n. Oh, I see the problem, we can't customize admin views\u2026  So a template tag could be great.  We could even implement automatic datepicker localization discovery using staticfiles.  \"We try to find 'grappelli/jquery/i18n/ui.datepicker-de-de.js' with staticfiles, and if an exception is raised, we don't include datepicker locale\".  (However, I don't remember whether staticfiles is a mandatory app when using admin.)\n. :+1: Twitter Bootstrap is awesome nowadays, we should use it.\nBut that would require a lot of rewriting, and using LESS instead of SASS.  As I use LESS only, you can count on me to help if we do such a rewriting.\nMaybe we could also use django_compressor to precompile & minimify the LESS files to CSS at the first user request.  That's what I do for my professional projects, and it allows people to easily override variables using their own LESS stylings.  It also avoids having to include compiled & minimified files in the repository.\n. We can make our own \"theme\" based on the beautiful current design of grappelli.\n. No, that won't be easy\u2026  I can do a prototype if you want, to evaluate the amount of work needed.\n. In my opinion, that will be easier to maintain than with Compass for these reasons:\n- there is now a much larger community using Bootstrap than Compass, making it easier to find contributors\n- the amount of CSS to maintain should drastically decrease with Bootstrap\n- Bootstrap is easier to understand; we use powerful HTML classes and we don't have to care much about CSS\n- it's easy to customize its look with LESS\nThat being said, I know there has been a few backward incompatibilities from version to version, especially between Bootstrap 2 and 3.  But this wasn't very painful.\nAnd we can always keep an old version of Bootstrap without being obsolete, unlike django.contrib.admin.\nI guess @parsch and you are accustomed to the workflow with Compass and SASS. I don't really know Compass and you both did an awesome job using it, so don't worry if you want to keep it that way ;)\n. @LeonardoGentile: Excellent project!  Unfortunately, that would add a heavy dependancy.\nI'll start from scratch\u2026  Hardcore mode!\n. @sehmaschine I agree, using Bootstrap with no deep customization is not convincing.  Apart from being clean, Bootstrap default stylesheet looks generic and tasteless.  There's not even a color code!  But IMHO it's a good thing.  It just redefines the basic stylesheet of web browser, and it's up to us to use it as a design tool.\nThe problem is that most Bootstrap users are developers with no designer experience.  So most of the time Bootstrap CSSs are not customized, or sometimes with the small customization tool available on the official website.\nWhat I plan to do is include Bootstrap as a git submodule and add a LESS file overriding Bootstrap so that we get the same grappelli look as today.  I already did this for one of my professional projects.  See the submodule, the custom LESS file and the result.\n. @LeonardoGentile Yes, that's the same workflow (although I didn't know Bootswatch).  But what's the point of using Bootswatch if we want our own theme?\n. I just spent 3 hours on a prototype.  Of course there's A LOT of work to do.\nFrom what I did, here is how I see such a work & the amount of time to spend on it:\n- first, copy all admin template from django (and not from grappelli)\n- adapt HTML to work with Bootstrap & with the aim of handling all grappelli features, but with the minimal changes (70 h)\n- write LESS overrides to get the desired design (50 h)\n- add the minimum amount of CSS classes & ids for grappelli jquery object selection (15 h)\n- remove uncustomized templates, try to simplify other templates using blocks and extends (10 h)\n- remove any trace of old HTML classes & ids (5h)\nBut to be sure that it won't ruin grappelli, we need to test all the specific features of grappelli: autocompletes, sortable inlines, collapsibles, filter dropdowns, etc.  Before and after that whole rewriting IMO, using Selenium.\nThat should represent an amount of work of 20 hours.\nSo I think this whole job could be done in 220 hours.  That's 1.5 month of full-time job\u2026\n. @parsch Yes, that could be more precise if we explicitly plan which classes we keep, etc.  In fact, maybe we could \u2212 in order to simplify grappelli \u2212 make a detail of useful & useless HTML classes, their uses, etc?  Such a cleaning would be useful, even if we don't switch to Bootstrap.\nThat said, maybe all grappelli classes are useful; but I found so many different \"grp-*\" that I doubt it.\n. I haven't tried django-autocomplete-light with grappelli, but yesterday I started using django-ajax-selects.  It works perfectly with grappelli for CharFields, as you can see:\n\nAll you have to do is to define a LookupChannel, add it to AJAX_LOOKUP_CHANNELS and specify you want to use an AutocompleteWidget for your CharField.\nAnd why not replacing the three related lookup views of grappelli with ajax-selects?\nI always wanted to have an autocomplete lookup using methods or haystack in grappelli instead of simple SQL.  I am totally ready to do such a change, if @sehmaschine agrees.\n. :o\\\nAnother solution would be to change grappelli.views so that they are class-based generic views (there is a lot of code in common between the three views) using some kind of lookup channels when one wants to change the default behaviour of autocomplete_lookup_fields, etc.\n. Great\u00a0!  I start working on it right now.\n. Ooops, requested pull from stable/2.4.x to master\u2026\n. The pull to master was a mistake (for the second time with yesterday).  And for the locale, I know a main part is in django.contrib.admin, but not everything.  In the inlines, you introduced \"Open All Items\", \"Close[\u2026]\", \"Move Item\", etc.  I translated some other parts because I was not sure if they already were translated.  If you wish, I can remove everything that is already translated in django.\n. Thanks to you for that powerful and beautiful module!\n. I have the same problem with one of my applications.  There is about thirty models that are randomly displayed.\nSince the documentation mainly explains how to include all the models from an application, I suggest that we either:\n- sort all the models imported by a app.* by names\n- or explain in the doc how to do so (the line of code @philwo added in this pull request)\n. @sehmaschine What do you want me to explain?  I could spend hours describing how this is working :)\nBasically, these views are the same than before but reordered so that we avoid redundancies.  And since they are class-based, it's easier to extend, maintain, or even understand them, even though I agree the non-linear impression may be misleading.\nI chose to split filtering and searching in AutocompleteLookup because the search is typically what someone is willing to change.  Filtering is here a boring task that only selects the model to search in.  And since there were \"FILTER\" and \"SEARCH\" comments before this pull request, I guess someone else got the same idea before ;)\n. I created model_in_GET to ease reading and simplify has_valid_request.\nAnd yes, we can distinguish methods that should not be overriden.  Either by forbidding override (http://stackoverflow.com/a/321240/1576438) or by making them private, as you suggested.  A simple underscore before may be sufficient, since there is IMO no really good reason to make them private.\nAnd you are true, I could have put filtering in another method.\n. I had the same issue, so I am not currently using MPTTModelAdmin with my MPTTModels.  A fix would be awesome.\n. It could work if we changed this hard-coded padding with something like '&nbsp;' * level.  But this can't take MPTT_ADMIN_LEVEL_INDENT into account\u2026  We therefore need to convince the django-mptt to remove this setting.  Or make an ugly copy-paste of this template tag with a few changes.  Or write it here or in the docs this pseudo-solution for those wanting to get this working.\n. Looks like the problem is already solved in django-mptt/master, as you can see here: https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/commit/686f536355e6745eb3fa212fd21d10ddb1d13357.\n. Wrong branch.  I do it again.\n. That would work correctly since QuerySet.distinct() is distinguishing ids, not values.\n. Hmm, I'm not sure this '?' will be displayed.  It depends on how the JS handles this response. @sehmaschine, what should be returned?\nIf '' should be returned, then I suggest:\ndef get_data(self):\n    obj_id = self.GET['object_id']\n    if not obj_id:\n        return [{'value': '', 'label': ''}]\n    try:\n        obj = self.get_queryset().get(pk=obj_id)\n    except self.model.DoesNotExist:\n        label = _('?')\n    else:\n        label = get_label(obj)\n    return [{'value': obj_id, 'label': label}]\n. You're right; I forgot I wrote that.\n. grappelli.settings confirms you're right.\n. The issue is still there in 2.4.5.  The input has no grp-has-related-lookup class and adding it manually doesn't fix it.\n. @sehmaschine Yes, I'm sure.  Here is a screenshot so you can see this is the latest JS.  I added a breakpoint on the line that should add .grp-has-related-lookup and it's never run.\nI also withdraw what I said, manually adding grp-has-related-lookup does the trick\u2026  Unless you have a custom width, which is the case here.  So both JS and CSS have a problem :\\\n\n. :+1: \nAnother approach would be to add autocomplete_search_fields to ModelAdmins, unregister 3rd party models, inherit their modeladmins and add autocomplete_search_fields then register them again.\n. Closed due to branch error.  See #353.\n. Hmm\u2026  Why did you close that pull request?\n. No, I closed #352, \"its little sister\", where I made a mistake once again with the branch :\\\n. The small issue with your JS solution is that we can see the inlines \"moving\" from their default slot to the defined placeholder when the page loads.\nThere's also the solution of overriding the template.\nI made an implementation on dezede/dezede@ed13ccaf34494e71fd913fd785c229052f6acdc8.\nYou can also read a small explanation on django-users.\n. Yes, I'm very interested in reimplementing it. I don't have time to do it this week, so I'll have to postpone it a bit.  However, since I still actively use grappelli and dislike fieldsets_and_inlines_order, I'll have to rewrite this in the following weeks ;)\nBy the way, inlines already have verbosity.  Isn't that enough?  Here's where they are used:\n\nIn terms of implementation, it would probably be clea[n|r]er to add an explicit InlineFieldSet class that would be used this way:\n``` python\nfrom django.contrib.admin import ModelAdmin\nfrom grappelli import ImageFieldSet\nclass MyModelAmin(ModelAdmin):\n    fieldsets = (\n        (None, {'fields': ('name', 'type')}),\n        InlineFieldSet(ImageInline),\n        ('Administration', {'fields': ('owner', 'status')}),\n    )\n```\nI know that goes against grappelli's logic of implicit template overrides.  I know that logic means that it's easy to give grappelli a try, but that also tends to be obscure.\nAnd specifically here, users could be tempted to define stuff like description with your syntax. (For more info about description, see the end of this paragraph.  It's funny how it mentions TabularInline, as if vanilla Django supported inlines inside fieldsets!)\nBut that would have no effect nor raise an exception.\n. Nice work!  What library are you using to get those translation buttons? Is this django-modeltranslation?\n. Can you access /admin/merchandise/albums/ in your production environment?\n. OK, so admin registration and user permissions are working.  And what happens if you specify each submodule, as @sehmaschine suggested above?\n. There\u2019s a good reason for splitting the term.\nSuppose you want an autocomplete on a Person model with two CharFields for first name and last name. You want to be able to search \u201cBeethoven\u201d or \u201cBeethoven Ludwig\u201d, as well as the full \u201cLudwig van Beethoven\u201d. If we don\u2019t split the term, either while using __istartswith or __icontains, nothing is returned.\nI don\u2019t see a good solution without using a search engine or using multiple queries.\nThe best solution IMHO may be to avoid splitting the term if there is only one __[i]startswith field in autocomplete_search_fields + give users a way to write their own query. In my case that would be relying on a search engine.\n. @DeathBorn: This is a really tricky issue\u2026 That\u2019s why search engines are for. You see the problem with the '-'? There\u2019s plenty of other characters that need to be dealt with, like the many types of spaces, '\u00df' vs 'ss', '\u00e4' vs '\u00e6' vs 'ae' vs 'a', etc. \nIf we implement what you describe, we\u2019ll end up with an enormous query: it needs to filter against all the combinations of splitted words for all the search fields. And the query will contain dozens of OR, which is bad for performance.\nSuppose the search fields are first_name__icontains, middle_name__icontains & last_name__icontains, and you search Antonio Lucio Vivaldi. This is a simple case, I have far more complex cases. The query will look like that:\npython\nComposer.objects.filter(\n    (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n     & Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio')\n     & Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio Vivaldi')\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio Vivaldi')\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio Vivaldi')\n)\nAnd this is only a simple case, imagine when users search 5 words in a 10 search fields scenario\u2026 I tested the query above against a PostgreSQL table of 9000 people where none match the query: takes 60 ms to complete, and there are indexes on these columns. In comparison, the current query django-grappelli executes is the following and takes 24 ms to run on the same table:\npython\nComposer.objects.filter(\n    (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n     | Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n     | Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio'))\n    & (Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       | Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       | Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio'))\n    & (Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi')\n       | Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi')\n       | Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi')))\nThe good news is that this approach would solve #585. But it will not sort the results by relevance, which can only be done by a search engine. And of course, performance with a search engine would be unmatched.\nTo sum up, it would partially improve autocompletion while decreasing performance on most cases.\nIn my opinion, what we probably need to do first is allow users to specify their own AutocompleteLookup subclass in the settings. Since a lot of sites have full-text search, using haystack for example, this would be really useful.\n. We could add the list of available languages to the context of the view, then:\n{% if LANGUAGE_CODE in datepicker_available_languages %}\n  ....\n{% endif %}\n. Oh, I see the problem, we can't customize admin views\u2026  So a template tag could be great.  We could even implement automatic datepicker localization discovery using staticfiles.  \"We try to find 'grappelli/jquery/i18n/ui.datepicker-de-de.js' with staticfiles, and if an exception is raised, we don't include datepicker locale\".  (However, I don't remember whether staticfiles is a mandatory app when using admin.)\n. :+1: Twitter Bootstrap is awesome nowadays, we should use it.\nBut that would require a lot of rewriting, and using LESS instead of SASS.  As I use LESS only, you can count on me to help if we do such a rewriting.\nMaybe we could also use django_compressor to precompile & minimify the LESS files to CSS at the first user request.  That's what I do for my professional projects, and it allows people to easily override variables using their own LESS stylings.  It also avoids having to include compiled & minimified files in the repository.\n. We can make our own \"theme\" based on the beautiful current design of grappelli.\n. No, that won't be easy\u2026  I can do a prototype if you want, to evaluate the amount of work needed.\n. In my opinion, that will be easier to maintain than with Compass for these reasons:\n- there is now a much larger community using Bootstrap than Compass, making it easier to find contributors\n- the amount of CSS to maintain should drastically decrease with Bootstrap\n- Bootstrap is easier to understand; we use powerful HTML classes and we don't have to care much about CSS\n- it's easy to customize its look with LESS\nThat being said, I know there has been a few backward incompatibilities from version to version, especially between Bootstrap 2 and 3.  But this wasn't very painful.\nAnd we can always keep an old version of Bootstrap without being obsolete, unlike django.contrib.admin.\nI guess @parsch and you are accustomed to the workflow with Compass and SASS. I don't really know Compass and you both did an awesome job using it, so don't worry if you want to keep it that way ;)\n. @LeonardoGentile: Excellent project!  Unfortunately, that would add a heavy dependancy.\nI'll start from scratch\u2026  Hardcore mode!\n. @sehmaschine I agree, using Bootstrap with no deep customization is not convincing.  Apart from being clean, Bootstrap default stylesheet looks generic and tasteless.  There's not even a color code!  But IMHO it's a good thing.  It just redefines the basic stylesheet of web browser, and it's up to us to use it as a design tool.\nThe problem is that most Bootstrap users are developers with no designer experience.  So most of the time Bootstrap CSSs are not customized, or sometimes with the small customization tool available on the official website.\nWhat I plan to do is include Bootstrap as a git submodule and add a LESS file overriding Bootstrap so that we get the same grappelli look as today.  I already did this for one of my professional projects.  See the submodule, the custom LESS file and the result.\n. @LeonardoGentile Yes, that's the same workflow (although I didn't know Bootswatch).  But what's the point of using Bootswatch if we want our own theme?\n. I just spent 3 hours on a prototype.  Of course there's A LOT of work to do.\nFrom what I did, here is how I see such a work & the amount of time to spend on it:\n- first, copy all admin template from django (and not from grappelli)\n- adapt HTML to work with Bootstrap & with the aim of handling all grappelli features, but with the minimal changes (70 h)\n- write LESS overrides to get the desired design (50 h)\n- add the minimum amount of CSS classes & ids for grappelli jquery object selection (15 h)\n- remove uncustomized templates, try to simplify other templates using blocks and extends (10 h)\n- remove any trace of old HTML classes & ids (5h)\nBut to be sure that it won't ruin grappelli, we need to test all the specific features of grappelli: autocompletes, sortable inlines, collapsibles, filter dropdowns, etc.  Before and after that whole rewriting IMO, using Selenium.\nThat should represent an amount of work of 20 hours.\nSo I think this whole job could be done in 220 hours.  That's 1.5 month of full-time job\u2026\n. @parsch Yes, that could be more precise if we explicitly plan which classes we keep, etc.  In fact, maybe we could \u2212 in order to simplify grappelli \u2212 make a detail of useful & useless HTML classes, their uses, etc?  Such a cleaning would be useful, even if we don't switch to Bootstrap.\nThat said, maybe all grappelli classes are useful; but I found so many different \"grp-*\" that I doubt it.\n. I haven't tried django-autocomplete-light with grappelli, but yesterday I started using django-ajax-selects.  It works perfectly with grappelli for CharFields, as you can see:\n\nAll you have to do is to define a LookupChannel, add it to AJAX_LOOKUP_CHANNELS and specify you want to use an AutocompleteWidget for your CharField.\nAnd why not replacing the three related lookup views of grappelli with ajax-selects?\nI always wanted to have an autocomplete lookup using methods or haystack in grappelli instead of simple SQL.  I am totally ready to do such a change, if @sehmaschine agrees.\n. :o\\\nAnother solution would be to change grappelli.views so that they are class-based generic views (there is a lot of code in common between the three views) using some kind of lookup channels when one wants to change the default behaviour of autocomplete_lookup_fields, etc.\n. Great\u00a0!  I start working on it right now.\n. Ooops, requested pull from stable/2.4.x to master\u2026\n. The pull to master was a mistake (for the second time with yesterday).  And for the locale, I know a main part is in django.contrib.admin, but not everything.  In the inlines, you introduced \"Open All Items\", \"Close[\u2026]\", \"Move Item\", etc.  I translated some other parts because I was not sure if they already were translated.  If you wish, I can remove everything that is already translated in django.\n. Thanks to you for that powerful and beautiful module!\n. I have the same problem with one of my applications.  There is about thirty models that are randomly displayed.\nSince the documentation mainly explains how to include all the models from an application, I suggest that we either:\n- sort all the models imported by a app.* by names\n- or explain in the doc how to do so (the line of code @philwo added in this pull request)\n. @sehmaschine What do you want me to explain?  I could spend hours describing how this is working :)\nBasically, these views are the same than before but reordered so that we avoid redundancies.  And since they are class-based, it's easier to extend, maintain, or even understand them, even though I agree the non-linear impression may be misleading.\nI chose to split filtering and searching in AutocompleteLookup because the search is typically what someone is willing to change.  Filtering is here a boring task that only selects the model to search in.  And since there were \"FILTER\" and \"SEARCH\" comments before this pull request, I guess someone else got the same idea before ;)\n. I created model_in_GET to ease reading and simplify has_valid_request.\nAnd yes, we can distinguish methods that should not be overriden.  Either by forbidding override (http://stackoverflow.com/a/321240/1576438) or by making them private, as you suggested.  A simple underscore before may be sufficient, since there is IMO no really good reason to make them private.\nAnd you are true, I could have put filtering in another method.\n. I had the same issue, so I am not currently using MPTTModelAdmin with my MPTTModels.  A fix would be awesome.\n. It could work if we changed this hard-coded padding with something like '&nbsp;' * level.  But this can't take MPTT_ADMIN_LEVEL_INDENT into account\u2026  We therefore need to convince the django-mptt to remove this setting.  Or make an ugly copy-paste of this template tag with a few changes.  Or write it here or in the docs this pseudo-solution for those wanting to get this working.\n. Looks like the problem is already solved in django-mptt/master, as you can see here: https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/commit/686f536355e6745eb3fa212fd21d10ddb1d13357.\n. Wrong branch.  I do it again.\n. That would work correctly since QuerySet.distinct() is distinguishing ids, not values.\n. Hmm, I'm not sure this '?' will be displayed.  It depends on how the JS handles this response. @sehmaschine, what should be returned?\nIf '' should be returned, then I suggest:\ndef get_data(self):\n    obj_id = self.GET['object_id']\n    if not obj_id:\n        return [{'value': '', 'label': ''}]\n    try:\n        obj = self.get_queryset().get(pk=obj_id)\n    except self.model.DoesNotExist:\n        label = _('?')\n    else:\n        label = get_label(obj)\n    return [{'value': obj_id, 'label': label}]\n. You're right; I forgot I wrote that.\n. grappelli.settings confirms you're right.\n. The issue is still there in 2.4.5.  The input has no grp-has-related-lookup class and adding it manually doesn't fix it.\n. @sehmaschine Yes, I'm sure.  Here is a screenshot so you can see this is the latest JS.  I added a breakpoint on the line that should add .grp-has-related-lookup and it's never run.\nI also withdraw what I said, manually adding grp-has-related-lookup does the trick\u2026  Unless you have a custom width, which is the case here.  So both JS and CSS have a problem :\\\n\n. :+1: \nAnother approach would be to add autocomplete_search_fields to ModelAdmins, unregister 3rd party models, inherit their modeladmins and add autocomplete_search_fields then register them again.\n. Closed due to branch error.  See #353.\n. Hmm\u2026  Why did you close that pull request?\n. No, I closed #352, \"its little sister\", where I made a mistake once again with the branch :\\\n. The small issue with your JS solution is that we can see the inlines \"moving\" from their default slot to the defined placeholder when the page loads.\nThere's also the solution of overriding the template.\nI made an implementation on dezede/dezede@ed13ccaf34494e71fd913fd785c229052f6acdc8.\nYou can also read a small explanation on django-users.\n. Yes, I'm very interested in reimplementing it. I don't have time to do it this week, so I'll have to postpone it a bit.  However, since I still actively use grappelli and dislike fieldsets_and_inlines_order, I'll have to rewrite this in the following weeks ;)\nBy the way, inlines already have verbosity.  Isn't that enough?  Here's where they are used:\n\nIn terms of implementation, it would probably be clea[n|r]er to add an explicit InlineFieldSet class that would be used this way:\n``` python\nfrom django.contrib.admin import ModelAdmin\nfrom grappelli import ImageFieldSet\nclass MyModelAmin(ModelAdmin):\n    fieldsets = (\n        (None, {'fields': ('name', 'type')}),\n        InlineFieldSet(ImageInline),\n        ('Administration', {'fields': ('owner', 'status')}),\n    )\n```\nI know that goes against grappelli's logic of implicit template overrides.  I know that logic means that it's easy to give grappelli a try, but that also tends to be obscure.\nAnd specifically here, users could be tempted to define stuff like description with your syntax. (For more info about description, see the end of this paragraph.  It's funny how it mentions TabularInline, as if vanilla Django supported inlines inside fieldsets!)\nBut that would have no effect nor raise an exception.\n. Nice work!  What library are you using to get those translation buttons? Is this django-modeltranslation?\n. Can you access /admin/merchandise/albums/ in your production environment?\n. OK, so admin registration and user permissions are working.  And what happens if you specify each submodule, as @sehmaschine suggested above?\n. There\u2019s a good reason for splitting the term.\nSuppose you want an autocomplete on a Person model with two CharFields for first name and last name. You want to be able to search \u201cBeethoven\u201d or \u201cBeethoven Ludwig\u201d, as well as the full \u201cLudwig van Beethoven\u201d. If we don\u2019t split the term, either while using __istartswith or __icontains, nothing is returned.\nI don\u2019t see a good solution without using a search engine or using multiple queries.\nThe best solution IMHO may be to avoid splitting the term if there is only one __[i]startswith field in autocomplete_search_fields + give users a way to write their own query. In my case that would be relying on a search engine.\n. @DeathBorn: This is a really tricky issue\u2026 That\u2019s why search engines are for. You see the problem with the '-'? There\u2019s plenty of other characters that need to be dealt with, like the many types of spaces, '\u00df' vs 'ss', '\u00e4' vs '\u00e6' vs 'ae' vs 'a', etc. \nIf we implement what you describe, we\u2019ll end up with an enormous query: it needs to filter against all the combinations of splitted words for all the search fields. And the query will contain dozens of OR, which is bad for performance.\nSuppose the search fields are first_name__icontains, middle_name__icontains & last_name__icontains, and you search Antonio Lucio Vivaldi. This is a simple case, I have far more complex cases. The query will look like that:\npython\nComposer.objects.filter(\n    (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n     & Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio')\n     & Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio Vivaldi')\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio Vivaldi')\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | (Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio')\n       & Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi'))\n    | Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio Lucio Vivaldi')\n)\nAnd this is only a simple case, imagine when users search 5 words in a 10 search fields scenario\u2026 I tested the query above against a PostgreSQL table of 9000 people where none match the query: takes 60 ms to complete, and there are indexes on these columns. In comparison, the current query django-grappelli executes is the following and takes 24 ms to run on the same table:\npython\nComposer.objects.filter(\n    (Q(first_name__icontains='Antonio')\n     | Q(middle_name__icontains='Antonio')\n     | Q(last_name__icontains='Antonio'))\n    & (Q(first_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       | Q(middle_name__icontains='Lucio')\n       | Q(last_name__icontains='Lucio'))\n    & (Q(first_name__icontains='Vivaldi')\n       | Q(middle_name__icontains='Vivaldi')\n       | Q(last_name__icontains='Vivaldi')))\nThe good news is that this approach would solve #585. But it will not sort the results by relevance, which can only be done by a search engine. And of course, performance with a search engine would be unmatched.\nTo sum up, it would partially improve autocompletion while decreasing performance on most cases.\nIn my opinion, what we probably need to do first is allow users to specify their own AutocompleteLookup subclass in the settings. Since a lot of sites have full-text search, using haystack for example, this would be really useful.\n. ",

In both cases, the line won't break due the white-space rule but with the autocomplete + Firefox, the text is cutted.\nI solved it adding this rule in the screen.css:\ncss\n.grp-tabular .grp-td ul.errorlist li {                                                            \n    white-space: normal;                                                                          \n}\nAlso, with a standard select box, the add_another link seems weird due the float: left rule. I solved it adding:\ncss\n.grp-td select + a.add-another {                                                                  \n    float: none;                                                                                  \n}\nYou can reproduce this easier by throwing any error message and rewriting it through firebug. If you wait until tomorrow, I can test it with Internet Explorer too.\nThanks and sorry the mistake again :)\n. By the way, the problem happens in google chrome. Firefox is ok. I didn't tested IE.\n.

I think that this bug is closely related to #64.\nThe first idea is to add default class .untouched to all extra forms (which are empty) added to inline formset. When administrator tries to edit some of these forms the form looses .untouched class. When save button is clicked grappelli excludes forms with .untouched class.\nBut there are some cases when this behavior is not expected. For example, when inline forms include only select widget fields or some other inputs which can be untouched but expected to be saved as is in default state.  So this behavior should be optional.\nAny better ideas?\n. I think that this is a consistent solution.\nStill don't see how comparing values can help in some rare cases. The reason is that the serialized data in extra forms can be unchanged, but it doesn't necessarily mean that administrator doesn't want it to be saved. Am I wrong?\n. @sehmaschine you are right in case of old rows (taken from DB), but what about new extra forms containing some untouched data which still has to be saved (even if it was not edited)?\nI can't imagine a real example. Maybe there will be someone who can. So, let it be as you propose :)\n. After thinking for quite a while I came to an idea that I was wrong about these rare situations. All examples that came to my mind resulted in strong confidence that in all such rare cases a programmer will set extra = 0, because setting extra > 1 has no sense. And all unwanted extra forms added to a formset using JavaScript must be manually deleted.\n. Yes, I understand that. But in real cases I don't see problems anymore. Some marginal cases, for example, when inline has only NullBooleanField, can't be automatically resolved because adding extra form means that this form is already fulfilled even if administrator didn't do anything except adding this extra form. If administrator clicks \"+\" and adds form with NullBooleanField only he should have understand that he added a fulfilled form that will be saved in any case.\n.

    "kylemacfarlane": "In case anyone else comes across this it's easy to fix. Just set default=0 on your sortable field.\nNow you'll also run into issue 65 so you'll have to also set extra = 0 on your admin inlines.\n. I'm using 2.3.5 from PyPi.\n. This issue seems to be fixed in the 2.4 branch. Just remember to update your admin files and overwrite them with the new dummy files from 2.4.\n. I don't understand why you would want fields with default values to be excluded? Especially if the defaults are dynamic.\nIn my situation I only had a file field which can't be serialized and a hidden sortable_field_name with a default which the selector misses. So in the end nothing gets serialized unless the selector is changed to also pickup hidden fields. Excluding default values would create the same problem in a different place.\n. The sortable fields do not react to changes by users; they are just blindly renumbered when the user drags and drop the inlines.\nIf the inlines are to become \"smart\" and detect changes then they should be done properly as mentioned in #65 which would also fix #64 and then make this issue redundant. Otherwise just ignoring defaults would make #64 unsolvable.\n. The selector misses hidden inputs not because they're hidden per se, but because the template renders hidden inputs in a different location.\nIIRC simply the following would work too.\nvar fields = $(this).find(\"div.td :input[value], > input[value]\");\n. This bug has nothing to do with [value] but the fact that the hidden inputs are sometimes rendered in a different place in the template, i.e. not inside div.td. Tabular inlines are rendered something like:\n```\n\n 1. Hidden formset inputs \n\n<div class=\"tr\">\n    <!-- 2. Hidden form inputs -->\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"sort_order\" value=\"0\" />\n\n    <div class=\"td\">\n        <!-- 3. Regular inputs -->\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"something\" value=\"test\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"td tools\">\n        <!-- 4. Hidden row pk, fk, etc. -->\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"id\" value=\"1\" />\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n```\nSortables need to pick up the inputs at positions 2, 3 and 4 while ignoring inputs at position 1. The selector div.td :input[value] only picks up 3 and 4 and misses 2. Adding , > input[type=hidden] was the most precise way I could think of adding position 2 to the current selector.\nI don't think that stacked inlines have the same problem but they do have an issue with ghost rows where the label is displayed but the input is hidden so I imagine they will one day be rendered in a similar way to tabular inlines.\n. You're right, 4 doesn't matter.\nTwo is important because we can't serialize file inputs. So if the only input at position 3 is a file field then the whole row will be ignored. By including the hidden inputs at position 2 we have data we can serialize (specifically the sortable field itself is serializable assuming it has a default value).\n. 1) I numbered all my comments 1., 2., etc.\n2) I'm only interested in default values because they offer a simple way around #64. It's not a holy cow and a proper solution shouldn't care about default values.\n. There are methods for clearfixing that don't use overflow hidden. For example:\nfieldset.module .row {\n    padding: 8px 10px;\n    line-height: 18px;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    *min-height: 1%;\n}\nfieldset.module .row:after {\n    clear: both;\n    content: \" \";\n    display: block;\n    font-size: 0;\n    height: 0;\n    visibility: hidden;\n}\nfieldset.module .row.cells {\n    white-space: nowrap;\n}\n. It's being used as a clearfix on the login page, which the change for issue 97 has broken.\n. Really github? No double click prevention?\n. This seems to work for me. My only complaint is that storing in an actual hidden input is redundant if the variables are properly scoped. I came up with the following when the fiddle was in an earlier state but now yours seems to cover the same features as mine except you use a fake textarea.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/kjcFA/5/\nEDIT: In Grappelli I don't believe that document.ready should be used. Just dump the Javascript immediately after the HTML so that the events bind as quickly as possible.\n. I couldn't find a way to access initial field values in the template, only default field values. Looking at the Django source it seems like the initial values are actually stored in the form and the fields are generally unaware of them.\nSo I think you'd need to create a template tag that can get the initial values for the form and store them as JSON in an HTML5 data attribute. Something like:\n<form method=\"post\" action=\".\" data-initial=\"{% grp_initial_values form %}\">\nThen in jQuery you could do something as simple as var initial = $('form').data('initial') and it automatically parses the JSON and everything.\n. {{ field.field.field.initial }}\nDespite the naming it seems to actually be the default value from the model and not the initial form data.\nHowever the data is of course in Python format which means comparing it to the actual form values in Javascript is more complicated. Converting None to empty strings is one thing, but widgets can alter the value in all types of ways (especially custom widgets).\nSo a fuller solution might have to look like the following completely untested pseudo code.\n{{ field.field|grp_default }}\n.\n```\n@register.filter\ndef grp_default(field):\n    # Get the default value\n    # Taken from https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/forms/forms.py#L483-496\n    data = field.form.initial.get(field.name, field.field.initial)\n    if callable(data):\n        data = data()\n    data = field.field.prepare_value(data)\n# Convert the data to HTML format\n# I don't believe there is a requirement for widgets to implement _format_value but all the default ones do\nreturn field.field.widget._format_value(data)\n\n```\n. It seems to work fine for me but I didn't try anything fancy. I don't think performance is an issue considering it's only run on submit.\n. This is a Django bug: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/11277\nIt happens in contrib.admin too.\n. The grp-help class has no margin-bottom and looks too close when it appears above widgets such as the one from SelectBox.js.\n. Fields defined in readonly_fields in the Django admin will have the grp-readonly class around them but you can also use a custom admin form and change the widget on a field to something like widget=AdminURLFieldWidget(attrs={'readonly': 'readonly'}). Grappelli 2.4 won't apply any special styling to inputs like this because it has no selector for input[readonly], textarea[readonly].\nI've linked a screenshot of grp-help above a SelectBox. It doesn't quite touch but it's obviously much closer than it should be and looks misaligned compared to the help messages on the rest of the page.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/14Pcv.png\n. I rewrote my own version of SelectBox/Filter that can handle large lists (tested up to 11k) without slowing down to a halt. The default widget in Django/Grappelli is too slow for me and crashes IE and Opera.\n. I have it as a pull request over at the Django repo https://github.com/django/django/pull/222 It also includes improved keyboard accessibility.\nI doubt they will accept it since it doesn't have tests and I've never used Selenium before. One of the core developers has a complete jQuery rewrite with tests over at Django ticket 13614 which I think is more likely to be committed even though it's even slower than the current widget.\n. There's also a problem with stacked inlines caused by Django ticket 11277 which someone also opened here as #149.\nWith tabular inlines the hidden fields are placed in a different location and the inline ordering selector doesn't pick them up. However in stacked inlines they're still in the same location but hidden and so are counted towards reordering.\nIn my setup this creates the problem that the reordering selector picks up the default value in the sortable_field_name and so blank extras rows are renumbered and are detected by the Django admin as new rows. A simple solution to this would be to automatically put the sortable field into sortable_excludes.\nBut there's still the problem that stacked and tabular inlines behave differently with hidden inputs. We could just ignore all hidden inputs by adding [type!=hidden] to the selector but that might break some custom widgets.\nSo I think the following should be done.\n1. Add sortable_field_name to sortable_excludes automatically. Even if it's not a hidden field I can't imagine a situation where you'd want it to count towards reordering. In both stacked.html and tabular.html:\nsortable_excludes = [sortable_field_name].concat({% get_sortable_excludes inline_admin_formset.opts %}),\n2. Also select immediate descendants for tabular inlines so that we pick up the hidden fields and have consistent behaviour between each layout type. Only in tabular.html:\nvar selectors = \":input[value][value!=''][type!=radio][type!=checkbox],input:checked,input[type=file]\",\n       fields = $(this).find(\"div.grp-td \" + selectors + \", > \" + selectors),\n       submit_values = false,\n       has_value;\nWhen 11277 or #149 are fixed then a similar fix will probably have to be applied to stacked.html.\n.

Ahhhh, I see. No, I did not know about this tag. Will change it right away.\n. Check my latest commit .. I've separated the admin and grappelli medias. What's in static/admin/ is used to overwrite the admin static files and what's in static/grappelli/ is now specific only to grappelli.\nThis is a lot cleaner I think..\n. I think we'll be able to go one step further in the clean up by removing files in grappelli/static/admin/ that are unchanged from he django/static/admin/ and they should fallback to the django/static/admin/.\nBut this remain to test..\n. I've found the issue with sorting .. nothing related to JavaScript.\nThe problem is in templates/admin/change_list_results.html which has changed in 1.4 to support multiple columns sorting. They also added a button to remove the sorting on a column.\nThis is way harder to fix than I expected because grappelli changed the way sorting button works. In vanilla admin they added buttons inside the TH to control the sorting. But since the pre-1.4 column sorting in django admin was a bit naive, in grappelli you removed the button inside the TH and used a background image instead. So the whole TH is actually the sort button.\nThe problem is that now we have three different sort actions that must work within the TH: sort, reverse sort, remove sort. So using the whole TH as a sort button to toggle between ascending and descending won't work anymore.\nWe'll also need a new icons for the remove sort button and the unsorted state..\nI might give it a shot this weekend.\n. I've managed to fix multiple column sorting .. not without a good fight with the CSS.\nThere's some testing left to be done, but it looks pretty much functional.\nAlso, I've created a temporary icon for the \"remove sorting\" button, you will probably want to change it: icons/icon-th-ascending.png\nCheers\n. I think the folder grappelli/static/admin/ isn't even needed anymore .. I've tried to delete it and everything is still working as expected. Can anybody confirm this ?\n. Nevermind my last comment. If django doesn't find files in grappelli/static/admin/ it uses admin/static/admin/.\nBut it confirm my suspicion that we can remove JavaScript files in grappelli/static/admin/js/ that are unchanged from admin/static/admin/js/.\nFor example, I deleted grappelli/static/admin/js/urlify.js and django was still able to pull it from admin/static/admin/js/urlify.js.\nSo ultimately, the only files we should put in grappelli/static/admin/js/ are the one we need to overwrite from the vanilla admin.\n. Yes, I'm using it.. sorry if that wasn't clear in my pull message.\n. Yes I'm using it .. everywhere it's \"{{ STATIC_URL }}grappelli/....\"\nHardcoding /static/ wouldn't make sense..\n. Ahhhh, I see. No, I did not know about this tag. Will change it right away.\n. Check my latest commit .. I've separated the admin and grappelli medias. What's in static/admin/ is used to overwrite the admin static files and what's in static/grappelli/ is now specific only to grappelli.\nThis is a lot cleaner I think..\n. I think we'll be able to go one step further in the clean up by removing files in grappelli/static/admin/ that are unchanged from he django/static/admin/ and they should fallback to the django/static/admin/.\nBut this remain to test..\n. I've found the issue with sorting .. nothing related to JavaScript.\nThe problem is in templates/admin/change_list_results.html which has changed in 1.4 to support multiple columns sorting. They also added a button to remove the sorting on a column.\nThis is way harder to fix than I expected because grappelli changed the way sorting button works. In vanilla admin they added buttons inside the TH to control the sorting. But since the pre-1.4 column sorting in django admin was a bit naive, in grappelli you removed the button inside the TH and used a background image instead. So the whole TH is actually the sort button.\nThe problem is that now we have three different sort actions that must work within the TH: sort, reverse sort, remove sort. So using the whole TH as a sort button to toggle between ascending and descending won't work anymore.\nWe'll also need a new icons for the remove sort button and the unsorted state..\nI might give it a shot this weekend.\n.

    "xaralis": "Hi, the reasoning for the second commit can be situation I faced related to the submit_row blocks. I needed to override submit row globally (didn't wanna use the original django submit_row templatetag). I can imagine such a situation could occur quite often, it happens that you need to override some part of change_form.html template for every object.\nHowever, this is not at all possible without copy-pasting rest of the contents (not only the changed part) because when you define your own change_form.html, it's not possible to extend the original grappelli one -- you can try it, it just won't work and results in endless recursion loop. That's why I put the contents in separate file. This way you can easily extend the separate template without the recursion side-efect. Does it make sense now?\n. It's easy to override change form for some specific object type (~content type). The problem occurs when you need to make same changes to the change form of every object type while not forced to do copy-and-paste of the whole template code (which is totally anti-DRY).\nLet's say you would like to override object_tools block for every object type. You would probably go this way:\n1. Define custom [TEMPLATES_DIR]/admin/change_form.html\n2. Use the original grappeli template as base:\n``` python\n{% extends \"admin/change_form.html\" %}\n{% block object_tools %}\n    {# my changes - e.g. add new button for all the objects #}\n    {{ block.super }}\n{% endblock %}\n```\nThe problem here is the {% extends \"admin/change_form.html\" %} statement. This leads to infinite recursion because the template you wanted to extend is resolved as the very same template you try to define! There is no possibility to tell Django it should look for grappelli template as parent to extend.\n. I should mention that same problem applies to Django templates too. Django administration templates aren't designed in very customization-friendly way in my humble opinion. I just thought that we should try to avoid bad design decisions in case of Grappelli (which replaces most of the templates anyway).\n. I do not want to override it completely in most cases. Usually, what i need to do is just some minor changes like add something to object_tools block and quite often changing the behavior of submit row too. Unfortunately, current template design doesn't allow me to do this. The only choice left is to copy whole template to mine and alter it to my taste. This is something I don't really like because it is very unfriendly when it comes to upgrade the grappelli version. I would have to check everytime if something didn't changed in original grappelli template and forward the changes to my clone if it did.\nI do agree that having base template for every of those root templates doesn't sound very nice. On the other hand, I am afraid that this is by far the simplest and still transparent solution available. Other ways to solve this would require changes on the level of ModelAdmin class - to extend the template selection fallback in some way which would allow for having custom global template base.\n. And yes, you are right that same problem would occur if I tried to extend change_from_base in template called change_form_base. That's why there are two levels of the change form template. In my custom change_form, I am able to extend from change_form_base in the same way you would do it in the grappelli original. This is why I find it quite simple and transparent.\n. In case of Django admin, it probably _wasn't bad design decision but simply a decision they made. It's very clear they do not want to expose a lot of admin possibilities/interface to public because they don't think of Django admin as full-featured administration interface at all. It's mostly likely meant only as substitute when real administration is not needed. They do not want to be bound by lot of backwards compatibility they would have to maintain otherwise. I bet this is something you came across too :) I mean things like fixing broken grappelli compatibility everytime new Django version goes out.\n. Ooops, seems like that unresolved pull request stacks up when commiting to forked master. Hopefully, this is something you appreciate - I added localization of datepicker, which solves #5.\n. Ok, understand your point. It's a shame though since I will be probably forced to keep my fork separate (which was not the original intent).\nI tried to search for \"jquery-localization\" but didn't find the project. Can you help me find it? I might try to use it instead of Django js catalogue.\n. Well, those locales solve problem with jquery ui original files but it doesn't solve your custom text like \"Done\" button in datepicker. So, in my opinion, this is hardly a way to go.\nAbout transifex project... I would have to think about it a little. Dunno how much time eaten up I should expect.\n.

Has there been any progress with this issue?\nI have two sites to put live for clients and I will need to do some recoding if I have to revert back to the Django templates.\n. Since the website is not yet live, I can give you ssh access if you require? Or is there any info I can provide you with?\n. Ok, I finally got this working on my system.\nSehmaschine, is correct in my instance, it wasnt actually a bug but more to do with my settings.\nI was loading the static files from the dist-packages using apache in my sites-available file.\n\nAlias /static/grappelli /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/grappelli/static/grappelli\nAlias /static /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/Django-1.4-py2.6.egg/django/contrib/admin/static\n\nThis was stupid I know, but the way I was shown when first introduced to Django\nAll I needed to have was \n\nAlias /static /srv/www/mywebsite.com/public_html/static\n\nand in my settings.py\n\nSTATIC_ROOT = '/srv/www/mywebsite.com/public_html/static/'\nSTATIC_URL = '/static/'\n\nI hope this may be of some help to others and once again, thank you for such a great script\n. I can verify this also with grp 2.8.1 and Django 1.9.2\nThanks\n. Hi there and thanks for looking into this.\nOk, so as basic test in a Django 1.7 running Grappelli==2.6.5\nGRAPPELLI_ADMIN_TITLE = '<a href=\"#\">This is a hyperlink</a>'\nproduces the following. It always has back since Django 1.4 which is where I started using your Grappelli Module (fantastic by the way)\n\nThe next screenshot is Django 1.9 with the very latest Grappelli\n\nThis has always allowed me to add a little custom branding with my contact details etc\nKeep up the good work\n. Maybe it is Django itself which has changed.\nI found a work around using:\nfrom django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\nGRAPPELLI_ADMIN_TITLE = mark_safe(myHTML)\nOn Fri, Mar 4, 2016 at 12:17 PM, Patrick Kranzlmueller \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nsee\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/stable/2.6.x/grappelli/templates/admin/base.html#L78\nare you sure that you did not use a custom template?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/732#issuecomment-192258177\n.\n. \n",

The following discussion is based upon my setup but it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if others are in exactly the same boat.\n\nsehmaschine commented on 11 Aug\n@sdillinger well, haven't been able to reproduce this for 2+ years. I'm pretty sure this is not related to grappelli but your server/django setup.\n\n@sehmaschine: I'm with you 100% -- in my case at least, it had nothing to do with Grappelli itself.  As for reproducing (and fixing) the error -- perhaps I can help you with that...\n\nTL;DR\nA simple, working solution to this problem.  First up, two important references:\nhttp://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html#setup:\n\nOpen settings.py and add grappelli to your INSTALLED_APPS (before django.contrib.admin):\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    'grappelli',\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n)\n\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#django-admin-option---clear:\n\n--clear\nClear the existing files before trying to copy or link the original file.\n\nA caveat:\n- Using --clear is like a sledgehammer; it will clear all static files that aren't needed by the current project\n- So if you are using the same STATIC_ROOT for more than one project, then better to leave this method -- there's a more nuanced, less destructive method outlined further down\n- Essentially, don't use this for anything other than testing, unless you're comfortable to rebuild STATIC_ROOT\nNow the steps:\n1. Ensure you have 'grappelli' before 'django.contrib.admin' in INSTALLED_APPS, as shown in the reference above\n2. Run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear\n3. Test from the browser, with full reload of the page with the filter button on it -- error should be resolved\n\nBasic overview\nIntro\nWith the steps shown below, I've been able to reproduce and fix the error 100% consistently, using the following setup:\n1. Django 1.8\n2. DEBUG = False\n3. Nginx + Gunicorn via. Unix socket\nIn any case, as long as the static files are being accessed at STATIC_ROOT, the following steps should work.\nReproducing the error\nIn order to reproduce the error, note that I am about to contradict the official instructions as shown above, because that is one of the ways that this problem could have occurred.\n- Switch the ordering in INSTALLED_APPS, i.e.:\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n    'grappelli',\n)\n- Delete (or at least rename) the static/admin/js directory\n- Run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput, output should show django/contrib/admin in the path, such as:\n```\n$ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/inlines.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/collapse.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/related-widget-wrapper.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/calendar.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/collapse.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/urlify.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/core.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/jquery.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/actions.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/jquery.init.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/inlines.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/actions.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/jquery.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/timeparse.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/SelectBox.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/prepopulate.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/SelectFilter2.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/LICENSE-JQUERY.txt'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/prepopulate.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/admin/RelatedObjectLookups.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/admin/DateTimeShortcuts.js'\n21 static files copied to '.../static', 593 unmodified.\n```\n- Test from the browser, with full reload of the page with the filter button on it -- error should be manifest\n\nFixing the error\nThe resolution steps are almost the same:\n- Correct the ordering in INSTALLED_APPS, i.e.:\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    'grappelli',\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n)\n- Delete (or at least rename) the static/admin/js directory\n- Run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput, output should show grappelli in the path, such as:\n```\n$ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/SelectFilter2.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/collapse.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/inlines.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/urlify.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/related-widget-wrapper.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/collapse.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/jquery.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/jquery.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/calendar.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/prepopulate.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/prepopulate.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/core.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/LICENSE-JQUERY.txt'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/timeparse.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/SelectBox.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/inlines.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/jquery.init.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/admin/RelatedObjectLookups.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/admin/DateTimeShortcuts.js'\n21 static files copied to '.../static', 593 unmodified.\n```\n- Test from the browser, with full reload of the page with the filter button on it -- error should be resolved\nWhy is the problem occurring?\n\ncollectstatic is getting the static/admin/js files from 'django.contrib.admin' instead of 'grappelli'\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nAs in the steps shown above, could have the INSTALLED_APPS ordered wrongly\nAnother cause could be that collectstatic was run for 'django.contrib.admin' before 'grappelli' was ever installed\n...\n\n\nFurther details\nThe following points are from my basic investigations and not any meaningful experience.

When you run collectstatic again, it produces the correct files that you need to keep.\n. @mykljohn \nI've run into this problem a number of times and I am definite that the issue lies between collectstatic and the configuration of your web server for serving static files.  You didn't mention either of these above and it would help if you could explain these further.\n\nbut in devtools it still shows:\n// Puts the included jQuery into our own namespace\nvar django = {\n\"jQuery\": jQuery.noConflict(true)\n};\n\nThis indicates that your web server is still serving the file provided by django-admin instead of grappelli.  So that is where you need to look for resolving this.\n\nBut it still shows as original...it definitely appears to be a caching issue, so I rebooted and it still shows the same.\n\nI'm definite that it is not a caching issue.  Configuration and serving of static files is where I'm sure you will find the problem.\nOne way to do that is find the URL where jquery.init.js is being served from.  For example, using Firefox dev tools:\n1. Go to the Network tab\n2. Reload the page if necessary\n3. Locate jquery.init.js\n4. Right-click and open in a new tab\nWhat's the URL being used?  What's the content of the file?\nLeave this tab open while you are trying to resolve this problem, since you can keep refreshing it each time you make changes to see if it is making any difference.  Then try these steps:\n1. Using the URL, locate the jquery.init.js file that is being served by your web server\n   1. One easy way to tell that you have the right one is to simply rename the file and the refresh the tab you have opened\n   2. If you have found the right one, then you should end up with a 404 Not Found page\n   3. Rename the file back to jquery.init.js\n2. At this point, manually change this file to have the correct content (as you have done above) and confirm that is displayed when you refresh the page again\n3. If that works, then the filter button should work again once you refresh that page (i.e. the page with the filter button on it)\nIf you get this far, then the problem is somewhere with collectstatic or the web server configuration.\nNotes:\n1. At no point during this process did I need to restart the web server or clear the browser cache\n2. As soon as changes are made to the correct file, they are displayed when refreshing the pages in the browser, even for the filter button\n. The following resources might be useful to you:\n- https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/502BadGateway\n- https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Django400BadRequest\nHow about python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear?  Quoting from my post on the other issue:\n\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#django-admin-option---clear:\n--clear\nClear the existing files before trying to copy or link the original file.\nA caveat:\nUsing --clear is like a sledgehammer; it will clear all static files that aren't needed by the current project\nSo if you are using the same STATIC_ROOT for more than one project, then better to leave this method -- there's a more nuanced, less destructive method outlined further down\nEssentially, don't use this for anything other than testing, unless you're comfortable to rebuild STATIC_ROOT\nNow the steps:\nEnsure you have 'grappelli' before 'django.contrib.admin' in INSTALLED_APPS, as shown in the reference above\nRun python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear\nTest from the browser, with full reload of the page with the filter button on it -- error should be resolved\n. > I then recreated the file with the code dummy code and refreshed and now I get Bad Request (400). That's with Debug = False, If I set Debug = True, it goes in, but has the old code.\n\nFrom https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Django400BadRequest:\n\n400 Bad Request\nUnfriendly huh? It's a common django problem though (as you'll see from a quick google search, and the answer is that you need to set the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in your settings.py (or switch DEBUG back to True)\n\nTo be able to set DEBUG = False, you need to set the ALLOWED_HOSTS value.  Something like:\n```\nDEBUG = False\nALLOWED_HOSTS = [\n    '127.0.0.1',\n    'localhost',\n    'Site_URL_goes_here',\n]\n```\nObviously, modify 'Site_URL_goes_here' with your site URL.\nGet it working with this setting and then see if the static file is served properly.\n. From what I mentioned earlier:\n\nOne way to do that is find the URL where jquery.init.js is being served from. For example, using Firefox dev tools:\n1. Go to the Network tab\n2. Reload the page if necessary\n3. Locate jquery.init.js\n4. Right-click and open in a new tab\nWhat's the URL being used? What's the content of the file?\n\nPlease specifically mention the URL.\nThen get the 404 error like I mentioned above:\n\nLeave this tab open while you are trying to resolve this problem, since you can keep refreshing it each time you make changes to see if it is making any difference.  Then try these steps:\n1. Using the URL, locate the jquery.init.js file that is being served by your web server\n   1.

Just to confirm, I've followed your link and this is what I've got:\n// dropped\n// not used in grappelli\n// kept this file to prevent 404\nSo that's the correct version being served here.  Perhaps the pythonanywhere people can explain what is going on at their end.\n. Right, that one is showing the django-admin version:\n// Puts the included jQuery into our own namespace\nvar django = {\n    \"jQuery\": jQuery.noConflict(true)\n};\nSo now the issue is with the static files that are on the web server.  You normally need to copy these over.  Please post your web server configuration.\n. No, don't delete anything, you might make the situation worse.  But the static files are being served by a web server.  Which one are you using?  Or which one is provided by PythonAnywhere?\n. Well, that's good news!  I'm glad I was able to help, even if indirectly.  If all is OK, please go ahead and close this issue.\n. ## Really sorry, don't have any experience with the dashboard.

The following discussion is based upon my setup but it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if others are in exactly the same boat.\n\nsehmaschine commented on 11 Aug\n@sdillinger well, haven't been able to reproduce this for 2+ years. I'm pretty sure this is not related to grappelli but your server/django setup.\n\n@sehmaschine: I'm with you 100% -- in my case at least, it had nothing to do with Grappelli itself.  As for reproducing (and fixing) the error -- perhaps I can help you with that...\n\nTL;DR\nA simple, working solution to this problem.  First up, two important references:\nhttp://django-grappelli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html#setup:\n\nOpen settings.py and add grappelli to your INSTALLED_APPS (before django.contrib.admin):\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    'grappelli',\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n)\n\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#django-admin-option---clear:\n\n--clear\nClear the existing files before trying to copy or link the original file.\n\nA caveat:\n- Using --clear is like a sledgehammer; it will clear all static files that aren't needed by the current project\n- So if you are using the same STATIC_ROOT for more than one project, then better to leave this method -- there's a more nuanced, less destructive method outlined further down\n- Essentially, don't use this for anything other than testing, unless you're comfortable to rebuild STATIC_ROOT\nNow the steps:\n1. Ensure you have 'grappelli' before 'django.contrib.admin' in INSTALLED_APPS, as shown in the reference above\n2. Run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear\n3. Test from the browser, with full reload of the page with the filter button on it -- error should be resolved\n\nBasic overview\nIntro\nWith the steps shown below, I've been able to reproduce and fix the error 100% consistently, using the following setup:\n1. Django 1.8\n2. DEBUG = False\n3. Nginx + Gunicorn via. Unix socket\nIn any case, as long as the static files are being accessed at STATIC_ROOT, the following steps should work.\nReproducing the error\nIn order to reproduce the error, note that I am about to contradict the official instructions as shown above, because that is one of the ways that this problem could have occurred.\n- Switch the ordering in INSTALLED_APPS, i.e.:\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n    'grappelli',\n)\n- Delete (or at least rename) the static/admin/js directory\n- Run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput, output should show django/contrib/admin in the path, such as:\n```\n$ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/inlines.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/collapse.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/related-widget-wrapper.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/calendar.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/collapse.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/urlify.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/core.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/jquery.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/actions.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/jquery.init.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/inlines.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/actions.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/jquery.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/timeparse.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/SelectBox.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/prepopulate.min.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/SelectFilter2.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/LICENSE-JQUERY.txt'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/prepopulate.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/admin/RelatedObjectLookups.js'\nCopying '.../django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/admin/DateTimeShortcuts.js'\n21 static files copied to '.../static', 593 unmodified.\n```\n- Test from the browser, with full reload of the page with the filter button on it -- error should be manifest\n\nFixing the error\nThe resolution steps are almost the same:\n- Correct the ordering in INSTALLED_APPS, i.e.:\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    'grappelli',\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n)\n- Delete (or at least rename) the static/admin/js directory\n- Run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput, output should show grappelli in the path, such as:\n```\n$ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/SelectFilter2.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/collapse.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/inlines.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/urlify.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/related-widget-wrapper.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/collapse.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/jquery.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/jquery.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/calendar.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/prepopulate.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/prepopulate.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/core.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/LICENSE-JQUERY.txt'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/timeparse.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/SelectBox.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/inlines.min.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/jquery.init.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/admin/RelatedObjectLookups.js'\nCopying '.../grappelli/static/admin/js/admin/DateTimeShortcuts.js'\n21 static files copied to '.../static', 593 unmodified.\n```\n- Test from the browser, with full reload of the page with the filter button on it -- error should be resolved\nWhy is the problem occurring?\n\ncollectstatic is getting the static/admin/js files from 'django.contrib.admin' instead of 'grappelli'\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nAs in the steps shown above, could have the INSTALLED_APPS ordered wrongly\nAnother cause could be that collectstatic was run for 'django.contrib.admin' before 'grappelli' was ever installed\n...\n\n\nFurther details\nThe following points are from my basic investigations and not any meaningful experience.

The following resources might be useful to you:\n- https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/502BadGateway\n- https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Django400BadRequest\nHow about python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear?  Quoting from my post on the other issue:\n\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#django-admin-option---clear:\n--clear\nClear the existing files before trying to copy or link the original file.\nA caveat:\nUsing --clear is like a sledgehammer; it will clear all static files that aren't needed by the current project\nSo if you are using the same STATIC_ROOT for more than one project, then better to leave this method -- there's a more nuanced, less destructive method outlined further down\nEssentially, don't use this for anything other than testing, unless you're comfortable to rebuild STATIC_ROOT\nNow the steps:\nEnsure you have 'grappelli' before 'django.contrib.admin' in INSTALLED_APPS, as shown in the reference above\nRun python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear\nTest from the browser, with full reload of the page with the filter button on it -- error should be resolved\n. > I then recreated the file with the code dummy code and refreshed and now I get Bad Request (400). That's with Debug = False, If I set Debug = True, it goes in, but has the old code.\n\nFrom https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Django400BadRequest:\n\n400 Bad Request\nUnfriendly huh? It's a common django problem though (as you'll see from a quick google search, and the answer is that you need to set the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in your settings.py (or switch DEBUG back to True)\n\nTo be able to set DEBUG = False, you need to set the ALLOWED_HOSTS value.  Something like:\n```\nDEBUG = False\nALLOWED_HOSTS = [\n    '127.0.0.1',\n    'localhost',\n    'Site_URL_goes_here',\n]\n```\nObviously, modify 'Site_URL_goes_here' with your site URL.\nGet it working with this setting and then see if the static file is served properly.\n. From what I mentioned earlier:\n\nOne way to do that is find the URL where jquery.init.js is being served from. For example, using Firefox dev tools:\n1. Go to the Network tab\n2. Reload the page if necessary\n3. Locate jquery.init.js\n4. Right-click and open in a new tab\nWhat's the URL being used? What's the content of the file?\n\nPlease specifically mention the URL.\nThen get the 404 error like I mentioned above:\n\nLeave this tab open while you are trying to resolve this problem, since you can keep refreshing it each time you make changes to see if it is making any difference.  Then try these steps:\n1. Using the URL, locate the jquery.init.js file that is being served by your web server\n   1. One easy way to tell that you have the right one is to simply rename the file and the refresh the tab you have opened\n   2. If you have found the right one, then you should end up with a 404 Not Found page\n   3. Rename the file back to jquery.init.js\n\nDo you get the 404 error or not?\n. Just to confirm, I've followed your link and this is what I've got:\n// dropped\n// not used in grappelli\n// kept this file to prevent 404\nSo that's the correct version being served here.  Perhaps the pythonanywhere people can explain what is going on at their end.\n. Right, that one is showing the django-admin version:\n// Puts the included jQuery into our own namespace\nvar django = {\n    \"jQuery\": jQuery.noConflict(true)\n};\nSo now the issue is with the static files that are on the web server.  You normally need to copy these over.  Please post your web server configuration.\n. No, don't delete anything, you might make the situation worse.  But the static files are being served by a web server.  Which one are you using?  Or which one is provided by PythonAnywhere?\n. Well, that's good news!  I'm glad I was able to help, even if indirectly.  If all is OK, please go ahead and close this issue.\n. ## Really sorry, don't have any experience with the dashboard.

I don't understand your aversion to Django's solution.\nBut you could make an option flag to enable it for tabular inlines, so its not a magical new behavior.  Or define a new option - like hover-over for the column title cell and/or any cell in that column. Or define a number of options so the user can pick which one they want to best suit their circumstances.\n. Heh.  One quick fix is to hide the help text with some JS in JQuery:\n```\ndjango.jQuery(document).ready(function($){\n  $(\".inline-group .grp-help\").hide()\n});\n```\nI'm trying to learn enough JS/JQuery to copy or move the HELP TEXT someplace else.  Either as the \"title\" text for the input field, or the column title.  Which would be a lot easier to do in the template.. Heh.  Ok.  So I figured out the Jquery to copy the help text message onto the cell container's \"title\" attribute.  So hovering the mouse over the cell pops it up.  I might try and figure out how to target the input cell itself, if users complain the pop ups are too distracting this way.\n```\ndjango.jQuery(document).ready(function($){\n  $(\".inline-group .grp-help\").hide()\n  $('.inline-group .grp-help').each(function() {\n    this.parentNode.title = this.innerHTML;\n  });\n});\n```\n. Grappelli 2.4.5 with Django 1.5.1\nGrappelli should respect the use of ModelAdmin.queryset.\nThat is, if defined, Grappelli should use it in place of :\nqs = super(AutocompleteLookup, self).get_queryset()\n(line 132 in related.py, function AutocompleteLookup.get_queryset)\nFor example, in django_extensions, I proposed replacing the generic queryset line with:\ntry:\n            # See if there is a custom admin queryset:\n            queryset = model.queryset(request)\n        except:\n            # If not, then make our own:\n            queryset = model._default_manager.all()\nOr be more clever and see if the function exists first.  try/except is just my quick and dirty method of testing fixes.\n. Sorry to confuse the issue.  I thought it would be clever for Grappelli to improve upon the limit_choices_to feature.  \nBut really, all that is needed is for Grappelli to support a feature added in Django 1.1.\nAnd \"yes\" that affects the base queryset all \"admin\" functions work with.\n. Sure.\nPaste code snippets here OK?  Or do you want something more sophisticated?\n. Actually, the simplest example is on Djangodocs:\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.queryset\nThis goes in your admin.py for the model:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    def queryset(self, request):\n        qs = super(MyModelAdmin, self).queryset(request)\n        if request.user.is_superuser:\n            return qs\n        return qs.filter(author=request.user)\nThis limits all records used in Admin to those authored by the logged in user.\nThis is what I use:\ndef queryset(self, request):\n    qs = super(TimesheetAdmin, self).queryset(request)\n    if request.user.is_superuser:\n        self.message_user(request, \"Warning: This is the ADMINISTRATOR view!!\", 'warning')\n        return qs\n    return qs.filter(site__id=request.session['site'].id).filter(staff__id=request.user.id)\nIf the user is \"admin\" they see or work-with all records.  Otherwise, they only see records that belong to the same site as they are logged in under.\nThis required I add a FK field called \"site\" to all my models I want restricted this way.  And I have to have this code in all the corresponding admin.py files.  All of my internal admin linked logic works perfect.  Then I noticed that all of my FK lookups (when you clicked on the select list or Grappellis' magnifying glass) showed ALL records, regardless of what \"site\" they belonged to!  \nI found this function to restrict the admins normal FK and M2M look up selection list:\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_for_foreignkey\nAnd this code works for the basic admin select widgets:\ndef formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n    if db_field.name in ('task', ):\n        kwargs[\"queryset\"] = Tasks.objects.get_query_set().filter(site__id=request.session['site'].id)\n    if db_field.name in ('job', ):\n        kwargs[\"queryset\"] = Milestones.objects.get_query_set().filter(site__id=request.session['site'].id)\n    return super(TimesheetAdmin, self).formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\nI'm testing django_extensions auto complete lookup as I posted above, I figured out how to \"fix\" their queryset.\nThat just leaves Grappelli.  I thought a ticket would be easier than forking and issuing a pull request. \n. Add this to your head revision and I can clone it onto my test server and verify it works.\n. Excellent, thanks.  Let me know if you need anything.  Time to head home for a pint for me.\n. Hm.  By the way, the zen of lookups is such that restricting a related lookup might not be valid.  Whereas restricting a \"pick list\" would be valid.\nBecause if something is already linked to a record, then its allowed to be.  Whereas the latter is going to make a link and should be subject to restrictions.\nOf course we would have delve into the nuances of a possible security risk.  Defeat a SAS system just by changing one value in a GET command...  not good.\nBased on my early testing - when I tried replacing the default manger - changing the Related lookup class would only work if all the relations are to records that will pass whatever restriction is placed upon them in the admin queryset.  Should work, so long as all data was created AFTER the restriction was added.\n. Did you want me to patch my code with that and test?\nOr is this in the master revision?  I can check it out and run it, so long as there is nothing in there that could cause me other issues.\n. I don't understand why your trying to find the \"current\" admin site.  All you need is the model class, which you have already.\nLike what I did to django-extension's autosearch lookup to fix the same problem:\ntry:\n        # See if there is a custom admin queryset:\n        queryset = model.queryset(request)\n    except:\n        # If not, then make our own:\n        queryset = model._default_manager.all()\nWhich is nearly identical to your code, except the lack of messing with the admin registry.\n. Did you notice that there is another way to fix this?\nYou could defer your FK selection to the admin's code.  That would let users customize your code the same way they customize the admin's FK/M2M select lists:\nformfield_for_foreignkey()\nheh.  Or both.\n. oh sh*t.  The line above my monkey patch in django-extensions is:\nmodel = models.get_model(app_label, model_name)\nNuts.  I commented-out my Try/Except to see what happens:\nFile \"/home/rcooke/django-extensions/django_extensions/admin/__init__.py\", line 107, in foreignkey_autocomplete\n  queryset = model.queryset(request)\nAttributeError: type object 'Company' has no attribute 'queryset'\nYou are correct!\n. I'm researching into how one hosts multiple admin sites, in the theory that would suggest a way to catalog what is available.\nDjango docs are very detailed here:\n- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#adminsite-objects\nEach site has to be an instance of the base class, so worst case you could do a getattr on global memory checking each object to see if its an instance of the class.  Since the constructor takes a \"name\" for the site, I'm hoping there is an report or list of what sites exist....\n. The last line of django.contrib.admin.sites (after AdminSite()) is:\nsite = AdminSite()\nAnd since most people follow the tutorial and examples, we can easily determine the default (usually only) Admin Site instance. \nHowever, I think we actually have TWO problems.\n1. Find out what admin sites exist.\n2. What do we do if the model is registered with two or more of them?\nAnd the second problem is \"worse\" than the first.\nI posted to Django's user forum on this. Django discussion link:\n- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-users/azFcdcxK0n0\n. I don't understand \"current admin site\".  It seems to me that multiple sites all live in memory and are active at the same time.  The only differentiation between them is the URL used to access them.\nAh.  Maybe that is how to best identify which site the current request is associated with:  inspect the GET parameters.\n. Right.  Which would let us (after making a list of all the admin sites in memory) identify which site has the indicated name.\nIts too bad Django does not make an instance list of the AdminSites.  Just a couple of lines in the contrib file would do it.\n. Yeah, working on it.  I'm trying out an idea - inspecting the model in memory to see if there is anyway to link it back to the admin site.  When I do a dir() on the model class returned by models.get_model(app_label, model_name) I see an object named 'get_absolute_url'.  Now where did that come from?\nAdding the admin site name or class instance to the (new) settings object  for specifying related and lookup fields (in place of the static method) is not too bad of an idea.\n. Heh.  I forgot about that.  I adopted a pre-existing project for managing company and contact info django-contacts:\n- https://github.com/myles/django-contacts\nThis clever thing has get_absolute_url defined as a @permalink function in the data model.  So, it might work but only for those data classes that define it.  No different from making users specify their adminsite model in settings.\nI was hoping the AdminSite code would add an attribute to the data model class that would link or at least identify the two.\nThis is the function I spotted on the model:\n@permalink\ndef get_absolute_url(self):\n    return ('contacts_company_detail', None, {\n        'pk': self.pk,\n        'slug': self.slug,\n    })\n. Sigh.  Its too bad the admin site does not publish a signal when a model is registered....\n. Not actively.  My client has not granted a budget for fixing it properly.  He had me hack my grappelli files to use the admin manager in place of the base manager - I only have one admin site so that works well. \nI also discovered the issue extends to filters.  That is, when you put a filter on a table view the filter pulls its choices from the base file manager, causing it to show choices that do not belong to the sub-set of records being displayed.\nWhen this client advances to needing a second admin site I can slot this fix in.  However, I can't say when - if ever - that will happen.  They may decide to keep the admin as-is and do custom views for the task-driven stuff they want.\n.\n. Another related wrinkle I discovered is that the FILTERS on any table view in admin with Grappelli do not use this limited query.\nThis results in the filter displaying choices that are not actually available to the current user.\nFor example, in my contacts database. One company division has a few hundred contacts. A new company division just started.\nWhen the new company division users logged in to start to add in their contacts, the FILTER for \"company name\" shows ALL of the companies that belong to the older division.\nAttempting to select any gets a \"record not found\" error.\nI was just about to go looking for the code that builds the list for FILTER.\n. Hah.  Never mind.  As you pointed out, this is handled by Django and admin.  I failed to head the instructions for configuring a filter to limit the queryset, in this section of the docs after \"new in Django 1.4\":\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter\n. Another related wrinkle I discovered is that the FILTERS on any table view in admin with Grappelli do not use this limited query.\nThis results in the filter displaying choices that are not actually available to the current user.\nFor example, in my contacts database. One company division has a few hundred contacts.

Grappelli 2.4.5 with Django 1.5.1\nGrappelli should respect the use of ModelAdmin.queryset.\nThat is, if defined, Grappelli should use it in place of :\nqs = super(AutocompleteLookup, self).get_queryset()\n(line 132 in related.py, function AutocompleteLookup.get_queryset)\nFor example, in django_extensions, I proposed replacing the generic queryset line with:\ntry:\n            # See if there is a custom admin queryset:\n            queryset = model.queryset(request)\n        except:\n            # If not, then make our own:\n            queryset = model._default_manager.all()\nOr be more clever and see if the function exists first.  try/except is just my quick and dirty method of testing fixes.\n. Sorry to confuse the issue.  I thought it would be clever for Grappelli to improve upon the limit_choices_to feature.  \nBut really, all that is needed is for Grappelli to support a feature added in Django 1.1.\nAnd \"yes\" that affects the base queryset all \"admin\" functions work with.\n. Sure.\nPaste code snippets here OK?  Or do you want something more sophisticated?\n. Actually, the simplest example is on Djangodocs:\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.queryset\nThis goes in your admin.py for the model:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    def queryset(self, request):\n        qs = super(MyModelAdmin, self).queryset(request)\n        if request.user.is_superuser:\n            return qs\n        return qs.filter(author=request.user)\nThis limits all records used in Admin to those authored by the logged in user.\nThis is what I use:\ndef queryset(self, request):\n    qs = super(TimesheetAdmin, self).queryset(request)\n    if request.user.is_superuser:\n        self.message_user(request, \"Warning: This is the ADMINISTRATOR view!!\", 'warning')\n        return qs\n    return qs.filter(site__id=request.session['site'].id).filter(staff__id=request.user.id)\nIf the user is \"admin\" they see or work-with all records.  Otherwise, they only see records that belong to the same site as they are logged in under.\nThis required I add a FK field called \"site\" to all my models I want restricted this way.  And I have to have this code in all the corresponding admin.py files.  All of my internal admin linked logic works perfect.  Then I noticed that all of my FK lookups (when you clicked on the select list or Grappellis' magnifying glass) showed ALL records, regardless of what \"site\" they belonged to!  \nI found this function to restrict the admins normal FK and M2M look up selection list:\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_for_foreignkey\nAnd this code works for the basic admin select widgets:\ndef formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n    if db_field.name in ('task', ):\n        kwargs[\"queryset\"] = Tasks.objects.get_query_set().filter(site__id=request.session['site'].id)\n    if db_field.name in ('job', ):\n        kwargs[\"queryset\"] = Milestones.objects.get_query_set().filter(site__id=request.session['site'].id)\n    return super(TimesheetAdmin, self).formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\nI'm testing django_extensions auto complete lookup as I posted above, I figured out how to \"fix\" their queryset.\nThat just leaves Grappelli.  I thought a ticket would be easier than forking and issuing a pull request. \n. Add this to your head revision and I can clone it onto my test server and verify it works.\n. Excellent, thanks.  Let me know if you need anything.  Time to head home for a pint for me.\n. Hm.  By the way, the zen of lookups is such that restricting a related lookup might not be valid.  Whereas restricting a \"pick list\" would be valid.\nBecause if something is already linked to a record, then its allowed to be.  Whereas the latter is going to make a link and should be subject to restrictions.\nOf course we would have delve into the nuances of a possible security risk.  Defeat a SAS system just by changing one value in a GET command...  not good.\nBased on my early testing - when I tried replacing the default manger - changing the Related lookup class would only work if all the relations are to records that will pass whatever restriction is placed upon them in the admin queryset.  Should work, so long as all data was created AFTER the restriction was added.\n. Did you want me to patch my code with that and test?\nOr is this in the master revision?  I can check it out and run it, so long as there is nothing in there that could cause me other issues.\n. I don't understand why your trying to find the \"current\" admin site.  All you need is the model class, which you have already.\nLike what I did to django-extension's autosearch lookup to fix the same problem:\ntry:\n        # See if there is a custom admin queryset:\n        queryset = model.queryset(request)\n    except:\n        # If not, then make our own:\n        queryset = model._default_manager.all()\nWhich is nearly identical to your code, except the lack of messing with the admin registry.\n. Did you notice that there is another way to fix this?\nYou could defer your FK selection to the admin's code.  That would let users customize your code the same way they customize the admin's FK/M2M select lists:\nformfield_for_foreignkey()\nheh.  Or both.\n. oh sh*t.  The line above my monkey patch in django-extensions is:\nmodel = models.get_model(app_label, model_name)\nNuts.  I commented-out my Try/Except to see what happens:\nFile \"/home/rcooke/django-extensions/django_extensions/admin/__init__.py\", line 107, in foreignkey_autocomplete\n  queryset = model.queryset(request)\nAttributeError: type object 'Company' has no attribute 'queryset'\nYou are correct!\n. I'm researching into how one hosts multiple admin sites, in the theory that would suggest a way to catalog what is available.\nDjango docs are very detailed here:\n- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#adminsite-objects\nEach site has to be an instance of the base class, so worst case you could do a getattr on global memory checking each object to see if its an instance of the class.  Since the constructor takes a \"name\" for the site, I'm hoping there is an report or list of what sites exist....\n. The last line of django.contrib.admin.sites (after AdminSite()) is:\nsite = AdminSite()\nAnd since most people follow the tutorial and examples, we can easily determine the default (usually only) Admin Site instance. \nHowever, I think we actually have TWO problems.\n1. Find out what admin sites exist.\n2. What do we do if the model is registered with two or more of them?\nAnd the second problem is \"worse\" than the first.\nI posted to Django's user forum on this. Django discussion link:\n- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-users/azFcdcxK0n0\n. I don't understand \"current admin site\".  It seems to me that multiple sites all live in memory and are active at the same time.  The only differentiation between them is the URL used to access them.\nAh.  Maybe that is how to best identify which site the current request is associated with:  inspect the GET parameters.\n. Right.  Which would let us (after making a list of all the admin sites in memory) identify which site has the indicated name.\nIts too bad Django does not make an instance list of the AdminSites.  Just a couple of lines in the contrib file would do it.\n. Yeah, working on it.  I'm trying out an idea - inspecting the model in memory to see if there is anyway to link it back to the admin site.  When I do a dir() on the model class returned by models.get_model(app_label, model_name) I see an object named 'get_absolute_url'.  Now where did that come from?\nAdding the admin site name or class instance to the (new) settings object  for specifying related and lookup fields (in place of the static method) is not too bad of an idea.\n. Heh.  I forgot about that.  I adopted a pre-existing project for managing company and contact info django-contacts:\n- https://github.com/myles/django-contacts\nThis clever thing has get_absolute_url defined as a @permalink function in the data model.  So, it might work but only for those data classes that define it.  No different from making users specify their adminsite model in settings.\nI was hoping the AdminSite code would add an attribute to the data model class that would link or at least identify the two.\nThis is the function I spotted on the model:\n@permalink\ndef get_absolute_url(self):\n    return ('contacts_company_detail', None, {\n        'pk': self.pk,\n        'slug': self.slug,\n    })\n. Sigh.  Its too bad the admin site does not publish a signal when a model is registered....\n. Not actively.  My client has not granted a budget for fixing it properly.  He had me hack my grappelli files to use the admin manager in place of the base manager - I only have one admin site so that works well. \nI also discovered the issue extends to filters.  That is, when you put a filter on a table view the filter pulls its choices from the base file manager, causing it to show choices that do not belong to the sub-set of records being displayed.\nWhen this client advances to needing a second admin site I can slot this fix in.  However, I can't say when - if ever - that will happen.  They may decide to keep the admin as-is and do custom views for the task-driven stuff they want.\n.\n. Another related wrinkle I discovered is that the FILTERS on any table view in admin with Grappelli do not use this limited query.\nThis results in the filter displaying choices that are not actually available to the current user.\nFor example, in my contacts database. One company division has a few hundred contacts. A new company division just started.\nWhen the new company division users logged in to start to add in their contacts, the FILTER for \"company name\" shows ALL of the companies that belong to the older division.\nAttempting to select any gets a \"record not found\" error.\nI was just about to go looking for the code that builds the list for FILTER.\n.

One quick fix is to hide the help text with some JS in JQuery:\n```\ndjango.jQuery(document).ready(function($){\n  $(\".inline-group .grp-help\").hide()\n});\n```\nI'm trying to learn enough JS/JQuery to copy or move the HELP TEXT someplace else.  Either as the \"title\" text for the input field, or the column title.  Which would be a lot easier to do in the template.. Heh.  Ok.  So I figured out the Jquery to copy the help text message onto the cell container's \"title\" attribute.  So hovering the mouse over the cell pops it up.  I might try and figure out how to target the input cell itself, if users complain the pop ups are too distracting this way.\n```\ndjango.jQuery(document).ready(function($){\n  $(\".inline-group .grp-help\").hide()\n  $('.inline-group .grp-help').each(function() {\n    this.parentNode.title = this.innerHTML;\n  });\n});\n```\n. I'll take that as a \"No\" then?\nI implemented a work-around.  I subclassed the Number widget as \"MyNumberWidget\" and used the Admin widget override to replace the default.  Thankfully that seems to work, now my number fields have the up/down arrows for changing values.\nHaving those is a requirements for this app.  And of course I said \"no problem, a near zero effort change\".....  Argh.\nI can post the code snippet here in case somebody might need it one day.\n . ",

Please re-review. \n. Howdy, any progress on that? I like it :+1:  :)\n. Yes, that's the idea. The datepicker comes with \"en-us\" by default, so there is need to include locale stuff for it for every other locale.\nYes, I have checked the codes for other languages.

OK, this sounds reasonable.

Maybe I am not aware of some\nsimpler method, correct me if I am wrong, but it looks like it either\nrequires some extra JavaScript code, or a template tag or some middleware\nstuff. And, as a result, we will be running a line of code just to serve a\nstatic file, just to translate its name from one version to another.\nAs the locale files will not be updated too often (and, as the locale stuff\nis only for calendar - at least, for now) - I suggest that we just rename\nthem and add them to the repository.

(haven't tried, but now that I look more carefully at my package structure, I believe that that's the culprit).\nhttps://bitbucket.org/phretor/django-academic/src/049bf53c06681eecb19cf81427de827532ce2c83/academic/?at=seclab\nHowever, it's weird that academic.publishing.* and publishing.ModelName both work and academic.publishing.ModelName doesn't.\nI will check, and let you know so that you can close this ticket.\n. @sehmaschine I checked, and doesn't act as expected:\n- Code\n```\nfrom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _\nfrom grappelli.dashboard import modules, Dashboard\nclass CustomIndexDashboard(Dashboard):\n    def init(self, kwargs):\n        Dashboard.init(self, kwargs)\n    self.children.append(\n        modules.ModelList(\n            title=_('Publications (displayed)'),\n            column=1,\n            models=[\n                'academic.publishing.*',],\n            )\n        )\n\n    self.children.append(\n        modules.ModelList(\n            title=_('Publications 2 (not displayed)'),\n            column=1,\n            models=[\n                'academic.publishing.ConferenceArticle',\n                'academic.publishing.JournalArticle',\n                'academic.publishing.BookChapter',\n                'academic.publishing.TechnicalReport',\n                'academic.publishing.PhdThesis',\n                'academic.publishing.MasterThesis',],\n            )\n        )\n\n    self.children.append(\n        modules.ModelList(\n            title=_('Publications 2 (not displayed even)'),\n            column=1,\n            models=[\n                'publishing.ConferenceArticle',\n                'publishing.JournalArticle',\n                'publishing.BookChapter',\n                'publishing.TechnicalReport',\n                'publishing.PhdThesis',\n                'publishing.MasterThesis',],\n            )\n        )\n\n``\n- Screenshot: http://screencast.com/t/lQVgXXI5stlo\n-academic.*` is from: https://bitbucket.org/phretor/django-academic/src/049bf53c0668/?at=seclab\n. worksforme :)\n. @sehmaschine I'm still seeing this issue on 2.5.7 + Django 1.7.

Say you have two models, ModelA and ModelB, with ModelA having a ForeignKey field pointing to ModelB, which you want to run through autocomplete in your ModelA admin interface. Of course, in order for this to work in the first place, one must have registered ModelA with admin, which I agree is not something grappelli should be documenting. However, one might not necessarily want/need to register ModelB with admin as well (maybe I don't want/need it to be working with the admin interface) - but this will make the autocomplete in ModelA's edit form to fail in grappelli. So, I guess you see my point. This nuance is really causing the \"bug reports\" in your issue queue (I could spot at least one other apart from the one I linked to) and would be good to have it documented here (because it's causing grappelli's autocomplete to fail).\n. Hm, OK this might be a language issue then. Because \"alternative\" to me does not imply that it has all the same requirements. Besides, you say And you need to register both models with every kind of relationship when using django.contrib.admin. - that is not really true from what I can see, having tested the admin interface for ModelA with/without having registered ModelB (just the default way, without autocomplete or anything).

But if I add a new one, when I click on \"Save\" button the value of this new item is not set on the auto-complete field.\n\n. Hi.\nI'd like to suggest too, if it's possible, of course, to select multiple options in filter and then apply it togheter. Actually any selected option by user in filter makes a new request and the user must to wait for results to apply another. After applied multiple filters, it's necessary to invert the proccess to clear them.\nIn my view point, a good usability in filters makes the users happy, because facility a lot theirs jobs.\nAtt.\n. @sehmaschine Yes, for apply just one filter is better now, but if you want to apply multiple filters for each one you must select it and wait for reload the page. After the user need to clean one by one again. But how I said, it's just a suggestion for improve the usability.\n. \nHi, this is mine custom filter, just css and js was needed to do this. Of course, changing template is more easier, but I didn't be intrusive. The user select all options they want and apply and remove once. It's just my suggestion to improve filters e make grappelli mutch better for all.\n. OK, I'll try.\nOn django \"contrib/admin/options.py\" there is a class \"StackedInline\" that you can define the template name for stacked inlines.\nSo, I'd like to create my own template that extends from grappelli stacked.html.

Nice, I opened the same issue for dango-floppyforms. They changed and released 1.4.0 with this and  other issues.\n.

I'll reinstall everything for test.\n. It's working. There was someting wrong whith my envoriment on that time. Sorry.\n. Try dev/2.7.x with django 1.8+\nBut it's development.\n. Hi @sehmaschine\nI really think that is important, so I had developed an improvement on my system to do that. I added a button on left widget that on click open a popup to edit the selected object.  If this feature was supported on grappelli will be very useful for all.\n/admin/app/objec>/id/?_popup=1\n\n. Sorry. I never used raw-id-fields with inlines.\n. This happens for me on both browsers.\nLinux / Goggle Chrome  42.0.2311.90 (64-bit) \nLinux / Firefox 38.0.5\nOn rigth select multiple widget (\"id_field_to\") there is a inline style thtat set the height. If I remove it the height is the same on both sides.\nAbout the yellow backgroud on inlines widget, I think that jquery UI is using a different theme, because if you run this on 2.6.x version and 2.7.x version is different theme. On 2.7.x is a yellow theme.\nrun on browser console:   grp.jQuery('#grp-content-title').dialog();\n. I prefer the django_admin_tools dashboard. But there are some good ideas. \n- I liked your breadcrumbs, notifications and tabs instead of fieldsets is cool.\n. templates/registration/password_reset_email.html (line 7)\nchange:  uidb36=uid\nto:  uidb64=uid\n. Hello, grappelli is nice, great django app. \nAnother small thing in: templates/registration/password_reset_email.html\nIn grappelli template:\n{% trans \"Your username, in case you've forgotten:\" %} {% firstof user.first_name user.username user.get_short_name user.get_username %}\nIn django template:\n{% trans \"Your username, in case you've forgotten:\" %} {{ user.get_username }}\nSo, if the username is \"sehmaschine\" and the User.first_name is \"Patrick\", the user will receive in e-mail:\nYour username, in case you've forgotten: Patrick\nbut the real username is: sehmaschine\nby.\n. Hello again,\nTemplates:\ntemplates/admin/login.html\ntemplates/admin/change_form.html\ntemplates/admin/change_list_filter_sidebar.html\ntemplates/admin/auth/user/change_password.html\ntemplates/admin/change_list.html\nIn these grappelli templates is required a small review:\n{% if form.errors %}\n      {% blocktrans count form.errors.items|length as counter %}Please correct the error below.{% plural %}Please correct the errors below.{% endblocktrans %}\n{% endif %}\nMust change like django 1.6. It's not working any more.\n{% if form.errors.items|length == 1 %}{% trans \"Please correct the error below.\" %}{% else %}{% trans \"Please correct the errors below.\" %}{% endif %}\nBy.\n. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.6/#minor-features\nThe default widgets for EmailField, URLField, IntegerField, FloatField and DecimalField use the new type attributes available in HTML5 (type='email', type='url', type='number'). Note that due to erratic support of the number input type with localized numbers in current browsers, Django only uses it when numeric fields are not localized.\n\ninput[type=\"text\"],\ninput[type=\"password\"],\ninput[type=\"submit\"],\ninput[type=\"reset\"],\ntextarea, select {\n.....\n}\nOn CSS, need to include these new types, email, url and number.\n. Nice, I had this same situation, a custom form for user change_password and the help_text for password1 not appears.\nby.\n. Sorry by my poor english :)\nWhen I click on \"search button\", open a popup to select an item or add another.\nIf I select an item that is on the list, no problem. But if I add a new one, when I click on \"Save\" button the value of this new item is not set on the auto-complete field.\n\n. Hi.\nI'd like to suggest too, if it's possible, of course, to select multiple options in filter and then apply it togheter. Actually any selected option by user in filter makes a new request and the user must to wait for results to apply another. After applied multiple filters, it's necessary to invert the proccess to clear them.\nIn my view point, a good usability in filters makes the users happy, because facility a lot theirs jobs.\nAtt.\n. @sehmaschine Yes, for apply just one filter is better now, but if you want to apply multiple filters for each one you must select it and wait for reload the page. After the user need to clean one by one again. But how I said, it's just a suggestion for improve the usability.\n. \nHi, this is mine custom filter, just css and js was needed to do this. Of course, changing template is more easier, but I didn't be intrusive. The user select all options they want and apply and remove once. It's just my suggestion to improve filters e make grappelli mutch better for all.\n. OK, I'll try.\nOn django \"contrib/admin/options.py\" there is a class \"StackedInline\" that you can define the template name for stacked inlines.\nSo, I'd like to create my own template that extends from grappelli stacked.html. In this way, I dont need to have a copy of the template on my app. On grappelli tamplete, something like:\n-----admin/edit_inline/stacked.htm-----\nonAfterRemoved: function(inline) {\n    --code js--\n    {% block onAfterRemoved %}{% endblock %}\n},\nonAfterAdded: function(form) {\n    --code js--\n    {% block onAfterAdded %}{% endblock %}\n}\n------than I could do on admin---\nclass DivisionInline(admin.StackedInline):\n    model = MyModel\n    form = MyForm\n    template = 'myStackedInline.html'\n-----myStackedInline.html------\n{% extends \"admin/edit_inline/stacked.html\" %}\n{% block onAfterAdded %}\n    --my code js--\n{% endblock %}\n.

Thanks, that fixed it!\n. @sehmaschine \nMost likely not - it looks like the template context got changed, and app_label was moved to opts, with the new addition of opts.app_config.\n. @jcuotpc \nThe fix has not been merged: can you verify that my/this PR fixes it?\n@sehmaschine \nThere is no branch for Django 1.7 yet, is it?\nIt would be nice and helpful btw, if the Grappelli version would reflect the Django version somehow. Maybe using 2.7 for Django 1.7?\n. @jcuotpc \nIt's fixed in dev/2.6.x (new commit): https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/commit/accb699632deb3f7546b5d9883fefb44bdef6b25\n@sehmaschine \nOk, it was just an idea. Currently it's just DJANGO_MAJOR-1.DJANGO_MINOR-1 == MAJOR-1.MINOR-1, which is easy to remember, too.\nI am closing this PR, because it has been applied manually in dev/2.6.x.\n. Yes, it's only relevant for Django 1.7.\nI've thought that master would get branched for 1.7 later?\n. No, but I wonder what Django version the master is targeting then, since there is the stable branch for Django 1.6 already?\nbtw: I would appreciate it being merged, instead of cherry-picked (like in https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/pull/450); I just had to verify that it got merged actually).\n. @sehmaschine \nIs grappelli/urls.py not being loaded in your case?\nAre you using the new app loading mechanism for Grappelli?\nDo you have the default AUTH_USER_MODEL setting?\n. > do I need to use a custom user model?\nYes.  And then this also needs django-debug-toolbar's automatic patching to trigger it.\nI am not currently affected by this though anymore, because DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PATCH_SETTINGS = False is also used for other reasons (ref: https://github.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbar/issues/521).\nFrom the traceback:\nFile \"venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/debug_toolbar/models.py\", line 63, in <module>\n  patch_root_urlconf()\n...\nFile \"venv/src/django-grappelli-25x/grappelli/views/switch.py\", line 18, in <module>\n  User = get_user_model()\nFile \"venv/src/django/django/contrib/auth/__init__.py\", line 129, in get_user_model\n  return django_apps.get_model(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)\nFile \"venv/src/django/django/apps/registry.py\", line 187, in get_model\n  self.check_ready()\nFile \"venv/src/django/django/apps/registry.py\", line 119, in check_ready\n  raise RuntimeError(\"App registry isn't ready yet.\")\nIt's OK to leave this closed for now.\n. @sehmaschine \nI might have asked this already, so please forgive my ignorance, but why haven't you cherry-picked my commit instead?\n(It would also have provided more information in the commit message)\n.

It seems that behaviour for the prepopulated fields is defined in the prepopulated_fields_js.html, that generates script before page is fully loaded. In this case it is clear why prepopulated fields are working, when in the inline admin class extra is not defined or it has value greater than 0, but the automated value is not generated for the prepopuated fields in rows, that are added by \"Add another\" link.\nIt could be just shot in the dark, lets hope it hits something.\n. I did some debugging, and I found that my previous guess was right and wrong at the same time.\nIt seems that the problem is bigger than I thought, because value for prepopulated fields in stacked inlines is not generated in plain Django admin (without Grappelli) too. It would be useful if someone else verifies this.\nRegarding to prepopulated_fields_js.html it seems that it does not do what it is intended to do. What I mean is that CSS class prepopulated_field is never added to prepopulated fields elements. So I think that 23rd line in prepopulated_fields_js.html should be something like this (I am not sure about the part for stacked inlines (.grp-empty-form .grp-row.{{ field.field.name }})):\n$('.grp-empty-form .grp-row.{{ field.field.name }}, .grp-empty-form .grp-tr .grp-td.{{ field.field.name }}').addClass('prepopulated_field');\ninstead of \n$('.empty-form .form-row .field-{{ field.field.name }}, .empty-form.form-row .field-{{ field.field.name }}').addClass('prepopulated_field');\nBut these corrections do not solve the issue, because it seems that in the Grappelli scripts the prepopulated fields are not handled.\nIn django/contrib/admin/static/js/inlines.js (line 173) is code that deals with the prepopulated fields in the tabular inlines:\n```\nvar initPrepopulatedFields = function(row) {\n  row.find('.prepopulated_field').each(function() {\n    var field = $(this),\n        input = field.find('input, select, textarea'),\n        dependency_list = input.data('dependency_list') || [],\n        dependencies = [];\n    $.each(dependency_list, function(i, field_name) {\n      dependencies.push('#' + row.find('.field-' + field_name).find('input, select, textarea').attr('id'));\n    });\n    if (dependencies.length) {\n      input.prepopulate(dependencies, input.attr('maxlength'));\n    }\n  });\n};\n$rows.formset({\n  prefix: options.prefix,\n  addText: options.addText,\n  formCssClass: \"dynamic-\" + options.prefix,\n  deleteCssClass: \"inline-deletelink\",\n  deleteText: options.deleteText,\n  emptyCssClass: \"empty-form\",\n  removed: alternatingRows,\n  added: function(row) {\n    initPrepopulatedFields(row);\n    reinitDateTimeShortCuts();\n    updateSelectFilter();\n    alternatingRows(row);\n  }\n});\n```\nI could not find something similar in Grappelli codebase.\nI hope this information is helpful.\n.

What I believe can be done (although really feel hackish), is to override the function formfield_for_foreignkey in Inline, I believe is the same for ModuleAdmin, based on the function defined in BaseModelAdmin, and change  the widgets.ForeignKeyRawIdWidget construction in the following code:\nif db_field.name in self.raw_id_fields:\n        kwargs['widget'] = widgets.ForeignKeyRawIdWidget(db_field.rel,\n                                self.admin_site, using=db)\nWhat I did was subclass from widgets.ForeignKeyRawIdWidget and overwrite the url_parameters to add in my filters, which are actually defined in the actual Foreign Model Admin's list_filter\ndef url_parameters(self):\n    from django.contrib.admin.views.main import TO_FIELD_VAR\n    params = self.base_url_parameters()\n    params.update({TO_FIELD_VAR: self.rel.get_related_field().name})\n    params['sell_ind__exact'] = '1'\n    return params\n.

The code is pretty well committed as to which function was introduced in django 1.8, so let me know which ones are safe to remove.\nI'll patch this up with a commit that throws away methods I think are irrelevant, and hopefully that will be a better merge candidate. Thanks @m-aciek for bumping this up :facepunch: \n. @sehmaschine got it, I tried my best to copy over all methods that were in django1.8, dedup all those functions we already have on grappelli, and commented the appropriate options. Let me know if I can help with anything else.\n. @parsch understood, in that case can we consider removing that line then? (In my use case it is an extra DB hit to query the name.)\n. @parsch got it, thanks!\n. ",

Yes we should, 3.5 wasn't out when I wrote this patch :horse_racing: \n. No objections! Do you know how to create a travis file or should I write a new PR?\n. Indeed, I recommend putting them all in the tox file, and locally running e.g.tox -e py27-django17,py34-django17. It's what several other projects do.\n. This breaks sometimes for us sometimes, we getOperationalError: (1116, 'Too many tables; MariaDB can only use 61 tables in a join')` when a search query with many words is used and the filters join tables\n. Ok, any testing/feedback I can do?\n. I've been looking around a bit. Django 1.10 upgraded from jQuery 2.1.4 to 2.2.3, but Grappelli 2.9.x is currently replacing that with version 2.1.4 again - shouldn't it be upgraded? \ud83d\ude04 \nOther than that I have spotted some other issues that seem to be in our custom javascript, but will update if any of these look like they're in Grappelli. Thx.\n. Ok, just seemed like you were in sync with 1.9 there. Also Grappelli replaces django.jQuery so I thought it would be following it.\n. In fact b1963500349f262160659d62b92eb8e72f88be17 copied in jQuery 2.2.3 (rather than just dropping the file to prevent static 'shadowing' of django.contrib.admin), but it still shadows jquery.init.js so the end result is that django.jQuery is the 2.1.4 version but window.jQuery is the 2.2.3. :thinking: \n. @sehmaschine bump - any idea about the jQuery changes?\n. Read my above comment, I don't think I can explain it any better\n. In grappelli 2.8.x the vendored jQuery files are just comments: https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/static/admin/js/vendor/jquery/jquery.js . This claims to be to 'shadow' the file in Django, i.e. replace the one in django.contrib.admin. It does this because Django's staticfiles gives priority to grappelli as it's first in INSTALLED_APPS as per the install guide. Grappelli 2.8.x then replaces django.jQuery with the version it ships, which is 2.1.4 - the same as what Django 1.9 ships: https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.9.x/django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/vendor/jquery/jquery.js\nIn 2.9.x Grappelli has removed the comments in the vendored jQuery file and instead committed jQuery 2.2.3. This is unnecessary - dropping the files (jquery.js and jquery.min.js) would suffice as Django 1.10 ships jQuery 2.2.3 in the same file, and the 'shadowing' would thus be no longer required. However 2.9.x still ships jQuery 2.1.4 and still replaces django.jQuery with it. So it's downgrading Django's version of jQuery, even after what appears to be attempts to upgrade to 2.2.3. This is a potential source of bugs as Django's jQuery code is only tested against 2.2.3.\nI'd recommend just always using Django's version of jQuery in Grappelli, especially since in 2.8.x that was what was effectively done by shipping 2.1.4, the same version that Django shipped.\n.

Ok, any testing/feedback I can do?\n. I've been looking around a bit. Django 1.10 upgraded from jQuery 2.1.4 to 2.2.3, but Grappelli 2.9.x is currently replacing that with version 2.1.4 again - shouldn't it be upgraded? \ud83d\ude04 \nOther than that I have spotted some other issues that seem to be in our custom javascript, but will update if any of these look like they're in Grappelli. Thx.\n. Ok, just seemed like you were in sync with 1.9 there. Also Grappelli replaces django.jQuery so I thought it would be following it.\n. In fact b1963500349f262160659d62b92eb8e72f88be17 copied in jQuery 2.2.3 (rather than just dropping the file to prevent static 'shadowing' of django.contrib.admin), but it still shadows jquery.init.js so the end result is that django.jQuery is the 2.1.4 version but window.jQuery is the 2.2.3. :thinking: \n. @sehmaschine bump - any idea about the jQuery changes?\n. Read my above comment, I don't think I can explain it any better\n. In grappelli 2.8.x the vendored jQuery files are just comments: https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/blob/master/grappelli/static/admin/js/vendor/jquery/jquery.js . This claims to be to 'shadow' the file in Django, i.e. replace the one in django.contrib.admin. It does this because Django's staticfiles gives priority to grappelli as it's first in INSTALLED_APPS as per the install guide. Grappelli 2.8.x then replaces django.jQuery with the version it ships, which is 2.1.4 - the same as what Django 1.9 ships: https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.9.x/django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/vendor/jquery/jquery.js\nIn 2.9.x Grappelli has removed the comments in the vendored jQuery file and instead committed jQuery 2.2.3. This is unnecessary - dropping the files (jquery.js and jquery.min.js) would suffice as Django 1.10 ships jQuery 2.2.3 in the same file, and the 'shadowing' would thus be no longer required. However 2.9.x still ships jQuery 2.1.4 and still replaces django.jQuery with it. So it's downgrading Django's version of jQuery, even after what appears to be attempts to upgrade to 2.2.3. This is a potential source of bugs as Django's jQuery code is only tested against 2.2.3.\nI'd recommend just always using Django's version of jQuery in Grappelli, especially since in 2.8.x that was what was effectively done by shipping 2.1.4, the same version that Django shipped.\n.

    "SebasSBM": "Due to I compiled it from source because it wasn't available in apt-get repositories. In addition, this Python 2.7.9 console lacks some features (like moving the cursor in the command prompt, or switching to the commands you used earlier with up and down arrows) that the default Python 2.7.3 included.\nDue to this cause, I consider plausible that some functions available in 2.7.3 became deprecated in 2.7.9, or work in a different way, or something else with the potential to \"break\" the code, to say something.\nNow I think 2.7.9 is not the problem at all. In any case, I'm not sure.\n. I've been looking at the function switch_user_dropdown() itself, and it is made to return empty string if SWITCH_USER is False. I don't know enough details to be sure about if this has been made on purpose or not, but I think the test is probably giving a \"fake negative\" - in other words, assertion fails even if it is working as it has to work?\nI hope this helps.\nPD: \n- SWITCH_USER comes from grappelli.settings\n- Keep in mind: in my case, I am only using one single superuser. Maybe the test didn't expect such situation?\n. After fixing incorrect configurations of STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_ROOT and STATICFILES_DIRS in myproject/settings.py, those 3 errors has dissappeared. Instead, this error appeared in the test:\n```\nFAIL: test_autocomplete_lookup (grappelli.tests.test_related.RelatedTests)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/venvs/mdrcms/lib/python2.7/site-packages/grappelli/tests/test_related.py\", line 198, in test_autocomplete_lookup\n    self.assertEqual(response.content, json.dumps([{\"value\": None, \"label\": \"0 results\"}]))\nAssertionError: '[{\"value\": null, \"label\": \"0 resultados\"}]' != '[{\"value\": null, \"label\": \"0 results\"}]'\n```\nThis new error is probably caused by LANGUAGE_CODE = 'es-es' in myproject/settings.py (the only difference between the expected result and the actual result is the word resultados which is results in Spanish). So, this is a minor failure of the test itself that makes assert statement to fail just because the language is different...\nMY OPINION:\nDue to the original cause of the opening of this issue has dissappeared, and seemed to be caused by my own misconfiguration, maybe this issue should be closed...\n@sehmaschine Looking back into how messy my configuration was (see issue #666) now I feel guilty for the waste of time this probably was for you...\n. It looks like python manage.py collectstatic didn't collect grappelli/static/admin during installation/setup (but it did collect grappelli/static/grappelli... see the Quickstart Guide setup section). I tried to copy/paste the folder grappelli/static/admin into my project's static directory, but the bug didn't fix... then, I tried running python manage.py collectstatic again and clearing my browser's cache, but it still doesn't work...\nEDIT: It looks like grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.js is directly implied in the process of controlling the checkboxes' state. I hadn't time to figure out the whole picture of how it works yet, but I have noticed something strange: for some reason, grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.js and grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.min.js have the same code (in other words, diff actions.js actions.min.js returns nothing).\nEDIT2: From this point, I can see actions.js is loaded into the templates that control DB's registers from admin panel (through Firebug). So, it looks quite evident the JS code implied on controlling selected rows got \"broken\" -at least in my environment. \n. Well, I'm not sure at all. Right now I was trying to debug JS with Firebug. The following log is shown:\nTypeError: $(...).actions is not a function\n    $(\"tr input.action-select\").actions();\nI am trying to track this hardcoded JS function through the templates. It looks like it is in templates/admin/change_list.html line20... also in change_list_filter_sidebar.html line20\n. I made copy-paste from actions.js from Firebug to a dumb file, to compare them with diff. Identations are different (they come as tabs from Firebug) and this is interfering with the result. I'll replace tabs for spaces with vim to see if I can obtain a better comparison...\nEDIT: they seem to have relevant differences. So it seems the loaded actions.js is not the correct one...\n. Probably... but it is strange: the rest of grappelli's JS seem to be correct (collapsables work). I will check once again my settings.py file just in case, but, in theory, static files load well...\nMaybe I have overlooked something... So, I will take a look to the docs again...\n. It is some kind of conflict between django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/actions.js and the one coming from Grappelli. In any case, I remember that when I installed Grappelli following the Quickstart Guide and run collectstatic, suddenly a folder called \"grappelli\" appeared in my static directory, but the \"admin\" directory didn't. I am not sure if this is correct behaviour or not...\nIn any case I don't know how Grappelli (or some other external app) is supposed to deal with static conflicts like this one, when it wants to override the default admin static files. I just know django uses \"the first file it finds\". python manage.py findstatic actions.js returns \"No match found\". I am stuck here...\nI will search in Django docs to see if there is a clean way to deal with this kind of overriding...\n. In my case, the one included was that one from django, instead of the one from the Grappelli module. But I finally got an idea to resolve it: just adding this in myproject/settings.py:\nSTATICFILES_FINDERS = (\n    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',\n    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',\n)\nNow it works as it should, and the bug mentioned in this issue dissappeared. As @sehmaschine said, it was a Django config issue...\nThis way Django will lookup in the external apps first. However, this doesn't seem clean enough as a general solution (it looks a little hacky, it would alter the default behaviour of Django). I would be making a fork of grappelli/settings.py to include this setting otherwise...\nEDIT: As a last test, I removed the mentioned admin folder that I copied before in myproject/static. Everything keeps working well, as it should\n. I discovered that setting by a casuality debugging the project I'm working on. Not all the global settings are included in a templateproject/settings.py, but any of the ones existing at django.conf.global_settings can be overriden from your own settings.py file.\n. @dhbahr I misunderstood you. I'm sorry.\nYou have a point. For some reason, this only happened to me.\nI installed other external apps (filebrowser, modeltranslation) and one of the things I tried a few days ago was: putting grappelli on top of INSTALLED_APPS tuple, just in case the others were interfering... But no, they weren't. I have no idea how could this happen.\nFor your information, I am doing the tests on a Virtual Machine and I took some snaphots, so, I can come back to an earlier state, in case some additional research is needed...\nEDIT: I've looked up to issue #667, so now I am aware you have (or had) a similar problem.\n. @dhbahr When you say \"I didn't need to override it\", do you mean you have resolved your issue without that setting?\n. @dhbahr Other sentence that I misunderstood... my apologies for the inconvenience.\n. @dhbahr Thinking about it, how many times did I become crazy looking up for something that wasn't working, and then \"oops, I forgot to clear cache\"... xD. Best of lucks, as you said; it earns a lot of headaches.\n@sehmaschine about this issue itself, I can go backwards to a previous snapshot, as I said before, for researching's sake. However, I am clueless about which direction to take... except for that I have noticed reviewing my notes that I installed django-filebrowser==3.6.1 before django-grappelli==2.7.1. I will give it a try to install grappelli first, in a previous snapshot, to discard (or confirm) that django-filebrowser somehow interfered in the process.\n. @sehmaschine Well, then better I don't waste my time with filebrowser's idea...\nI have thought about the dependencies I installed after grappelli - but I don't think they are interfering, due to grappelli is on top of INSTALLED_APPS:\n* Pillow==2.9.0\n* django-modeltranslation==0.10.1\n* django-tinymce==2.0.5\nMaybe it is a Django issue, due to the problems that its STATICFILES system has. I don't know Django - neither the Grappelli app - deeply enough to be sure about this tough...\nCLARIFICATION: I made the tests over a new Django==1.8.3 installation in a VM, not an update over a previous Django version. So, in my case, this is discarded too\nCLARIFICATION2: My \"hacky\" solution forces Django to lookup in external apps before looking in Django internal apps. It worked, but it seems an ugly solution anyway...\n. @sehmaschine By \"internal apps\", I meant those ones that were included in the Django project itself -in other words, the apps that came with Django package-; and by \"external apps\" I meant those ones that didn't come with django by default. Might it be incorrect to call them this way?\nIn any case, the \"hacky solution\" (for the record: I call it like this on purpose because it was an ugly solution) is not necessary anymore. After fixing the mess I had in STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_ROOT and STATICFILES_DIRS, the ugly setting is not necessary anymore.\nWhat was said in the issue I opened in filebrowser is related with this issue too. Same for issue #665. So, due to this issue was caused by my own configuration errors, I will close it inmediately. @sehmaschine Please feel free to reopen it if you think something else should be added for the community's sake. I just close it because I think this issue has been clarified.\nTHE MESS THAT CAUSED THIS:\nThis was my project's settings.py (relevant settings for the issue) before opening this issue :-$:\n```\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(file)))\nPROJECT_DIR equals myproject/myproject\nPROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(file))\nHere are the messy settings that caused this issue\nSTATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static/')\nMEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'myproject/') # <- Terrible mistake\nThese two ones weren't necessary at all...\nFILEBROWSER_DIRECTORY = \"static/uploads/\"\nFILEBROWSER_VERSIONS_BASEDIR = \"static/_versions\"\nDesperate try due to \"why the heck STATIC_ROOT files are not processed?\"\nSTATICFILES_DIRS = (\n       os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, \"static\"),\n)\n```\nBefore opening this issue, I didn't understood correctly the difference between STATIC_* and MEDIA_* settings, not even the real purpose of STATIC_ROOT and STATICFILES_DIRS. So, for the sake of clarification, I will expose my fatal errors configuring my Django project:\nWHAT I THOUGHT I KNEW BEFORE:\nSTATIC_ROOT = The folder where all static files must be (wrong!)\nMEDIA_ROOT = Similar to STATIC_ROOT? Doesn't seem to be necessary (completely wrong!)\nSTATICFILES_DIRS = Additional directories in which detect static files (definetely wrong!)\nAfter finding this part of Django docs I noticed how terribly wrong I was misunderstanding the way staticfiles actually work in Django.\nWHAT I \"KNOW\" NOW:\nSTATIC_ROOT = The folder where all static files in the paths contained in STATICFILES_DIRS and other Django apps will be collected into.\nMEDIA_ROOT = All \"publicly uploaded\" files must be included here! So, uploads and _versions directories must be here\nSTATICFILES_DIRS = Tuple of directories from which python manage.py collectstatic will copy static files into STATIC_ROOT folder.\n. Due to I compiled it from source because it wasn't available in apt-get repositories. In addition, this Python 2.7.9 console lacks some features (like moving the cursor in the command prompt, or switching to the commands you used earlier with up and down arrows) that the default Python 2.7.3 included.\nDue to this cause, I consider plausible that some functions available in 2.7.3 became deprecated in 2.7.9, or work in a different way, or something else with the potential to \"break\" the code, to say something.\nNow I think 2.7.9 is not the problem at all. In any case, I'm not sure.\n. I've been looking at the function switch_user_dropdown() itself, and it is made to return empty string if SWITCH_USER is False. I don't know enough details to be sure about if this has been made on purpose or not, but I think the test is probably giving a \"fake negative\" - in other words, assertion fails even if it is working as it has to work?\nI hope this helps.\nPD: \n- SWITCH_USER comes from grappelli.settings\n- Keep in mind: in my case, I am only using one single superuser. Maybe the test didn't expect such situation?\n. After fixing incorrect configurations of STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_ROOT and STATICFILES_DIRS in myproject/settings.py, those 3 errors has dissappeared. Instead, this error appeared in the test:\n```\nFAIL: test_autocomplete_lookup (grappelli.tests.test_related.RelatedTests)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/venvs/mdrcms/lib/python2.7/site-packages/grappelli/tests/test_related.py\", line 198, in test_autocomplete_lookup\n    self.assertEqual(response.content, json.dumps([{\"value\": None, \"label\": \"0 results\"}]))\nAssertionError: '[{\"value\": null, \"label\": \"0 resultados\"}]' != '[{\"value\": null, \"label\": \"0 results\"}]'\n```\nThis new error is probably caused by LANGUAGE_CODE = 'es-es' in myproject/settings.py (the only difference between the expected result and the actual result is the word resultados which is results in Spanish). So, this is a minor failure of the test itself that makes assert statement to fail just because the language is different...\nMY OPINION:\nDue to the original cause of the opening of this issue has dissappeared, and seemed to be caused by my own misconfiguration, maybe this issue should be closed...\n@sehmaschine Looking back into how messy my configuration was (see issue #666) now I feel guilty for the waste of time this probably was for you...\n. It looks like python manage.py collectstatic didn't collect grappelli/static/admin during installation/setup (but it did collect grappelli/static/grappelli... see the Quickstart Guide setup section). I tried to copy/paste the folder grappelli/static/admin into my project's static directory, but the bug didn't fix... then, I tried running python manage.py collectstatic again and clearing my browser's cache, but it still doesn't work...\nEDIT: It looks like grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.js is directly implied in the process of controlling the checkboxes' state. I hadn't time to figure out the whole picture of how it works yet, but I have noticed something strange: for some reason, grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.js and grappelli/static/admin/js/actions.min.js have the same code (in other words, diff actions.js actions.min.js returns nothing).\nEDIT2: From this point, I can see actions.js is loaded into the templates that control DB's registers from admin panel (through Firebug). So, it looks quite evident the JS code implied on controlling selected rows got \"broken\" -at least in my environment. \n. Well, I'm not sure at all. Right now I was trying to debug JS with Firebug. The following log is shown:\nTypeError: $(...).actions is not a function\n    $(\"tr input.action-select\").actions();\nI am trying to track this hardcoded JS function through the templates. It looks like it is in templates/admin/change_list.html line20... also in change_list_filter_sidebar.html line20\n. I made copy-paste from actions.js from Firebug to a dumb file, to compare them with diff. Identations are different (they come as tabs from Firebug) and this is interfering with the result. I'll replace tabs for spaces with vim to see if I can obtain a better comparison...\nEDIT: they seem to have relevant differences. So it seems the loaded actions.js is not the correct one...\n. Probably... but it is strange: the rest of grappelli's JS seem to be correct (collapsables work). I will check once again my settings.py file just in case, but, in theory, static files load well...\nMaybe I have overlooked something... So, I will take a look to the docs again...\n. It is some kind of conflict between django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/actions.js and the one coming from Grappelli. In any case, I remember that when I installed Grappelli following the Quickstart Guide and run collectstatic, suddenly a folder called \"grappelli\" appeared in my static directory, but the \"admin\" directory didn't. I am not sure if this is correct behaviour or not...\nIn any case I don't know how Grappelli (or some other external app) is supposed to deal with static conflicts like this one, when it wants to override the default admin static files. I just know django uses \"the first file it finds\". python manage.py findstatic actions.js returns \"No match found\". I am stuck here...\nI will search in Django docs to see if there is a clean way to deal with this kind of overriding...\n. In my case, the one included was that one from django, instead of the one from the Grappelli module. But I finally got an idea to resolve it: just adding this in myproject/settings.py:\nSTATICFILES_FINDERS = (\n    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',\n    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',\n)\nNow it works as it should, and the bug mentioned in this issue dissappeared. As @sehmaschine said, it was a Django config issue...\nThis way Django will lookup in the external apps first. However, this doesn't seem clean enough as a general solution (it looks a little hacky, it would alter the default behaviour of Django). I would be making a fork of grappelli/settings.py to include this setting otherwise...\nEDIT: As a last test, I removed the mentioned admin folder that I copied before in myproject/static. Everything keeps working well, as it should\n. I discovered that setting by a casuality debugging the project I'm working on. Not all the global settings are included in a templateproject/settings.py, but any of the ones existing at django.conf.global_settings can be overriden from your own settings.py file.\n. @dhbahr I misunderstood you. I'm sorry.\nYou have a point.

I thought this was the same except that Django manages the intermediate table for you if you use M2M.\nIs there something about this structure that may be causing the weird styling issues?\n.

I'm not sure if this suggests what might be wrong in causing the extra text to display.\n4) I played around with the related_label text to try and figure out why the display is weird, expanding to two lines. It seems like it may have something to do with the length of the text displayed. After playing around with it for a bit, I've taken screenshots of two examples.

I got the same results in both cases in Chrome, Firefox and Safari on my Mac.\n\n\n. Yeah, that looks very similar to what we have, except that Django creates the intermediate table, TVShow.tags.through.

I'm not trying to be difficult here, I genuinely don't understand how what you're describing is functionally any different from what I did. Django created the table below automatically, because I defined the ManyToManyField in TVShow (TVShow inherits from InterestDictionary). \n\nIt's a table that has three fields: an id, a foreign key to the TVShow model, and a foreign key to the TagHierarchy model - just like in your example of the TagToParent intermediate table. My inline is based on that model, the automatically created one, accessed via TVShow.tags.through, just like your inline is based on TagToParent.\nWhat I really don't understand about your suggestions are:\n- If my use of ManyToManyField is inappropriate here, in what situation would you use ManyToManyField? A Tag can be applied to many Interests, and an Interest can have many tags. I don't see why I wouldn't use ManyToManyField.\n- Given that I'm using a ManyToManyField, how should I display that in the admin site? The default display is a select-box, which is cumbersome to use for a large list of Tags. I figured it would be easier, then, to use an inline so tags could be individually added and removed; is there a way to do this without an inline?\nI will try to create some test models the way you described and see if I get any difference in behavior.\n. Aha! We finally discovered the problem, and understand a little better what you were trying to tell us. The issue was with this line in the intermediate table inline:\nautocomplete_lookup_fields = {\n        'm2m': ['taghierarchy'],\n    }\nIt should be:\nautocomplete_lookup_fields = {\n        'fk': ['taghierarchy'],\n    }\nOnce I made that change, the display works as intended! Everything seems to be in order - both the two-line display issue and the multiple-string-display issue are resolved. I appreciate your help. It was not clear to me until now that this was the line causing the problems, generating the additional m2m relationship; I misunderstood this line, thinking it was intended to describe how the two tables were related.\nHopefully this thread will be useful to anyone else who makes this mistake.\n.
