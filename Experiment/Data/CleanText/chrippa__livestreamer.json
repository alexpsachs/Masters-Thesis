    "chrippa": "To avoid any possible conflict please make sure you removed any possibly old version from your system's package manager before installing the git-verson. I just tried checking out the git-version and jtv-support is definitely still there.\n. I don't use that site myself so probably not, sorry. You're welcome to fork and add it yourself though.\n. Thanks :)\n. It could just be a problem with the Twitch servers, I'm watching a stream right now without any problems. Could you give me the URL to the channel you're trying to play?\n. About the codec problem, does this happen on all stream qualities or only on \"live\"?\nI believe the \"live\" quality on Twitch is the raw stream from the streamer himself and might be using an odd encoder, while others like \"480p\" etc, should be transcoded with a proper encoder by Twitch so they should always work in VLC. If not, then your ffmpeg or VLC might lack support to decode H264.\n. That's very odd. Does it make a difference if you output the stream to a file (livestreamer -o filename.flv) and then play it?\nYou could also try to play it in another player (like mplayer) with the -p parameter.\nThe stream you tried works for me in Arch Linux's VLC.\n. Thanks!\n. Nice!\n. I believe this is because the stream is actually offline (at least it was in my browser when I checked) but livestreamer think it's online because own3dtv still sends info about the streams in the XML API that livestreamer uses.\nShould probably find out if there is another way to check if the stream is online or not since the flash player figures it out somehow.\n. Thanks!\n. Hello, thanks for your contribution. I totally forgot to check if Python handled the \"- as stdout\" when using open(), which was not the case. I've commited a different fix which adds support for using \"-o -\" to output to stdout, as I believe this is more \"the UNIX way\" of doing things.\n. Hmm, well I suppose there is no harm in supporting both. :)\n. You need to install pbs. This should happen automatically when you run \"python setup.py install\", but if not then you can install it with \"pip install pbs\" or through your distributions package system.\n. Duplicate of issue #10.\n. Hmm, are you using python-pbs from AUR? If so, I believe it is out of date, try latest version of pbs instead.\n. Actually, the package maintainer just updated the python-pbs AUR package just now, so try updating to that!\n. Hello, I've just pushed some changes that adds some more subprocess error handling. Could you try running with the added -e option and see if it gives you some more useful errors to paste?\n. Hello, as the message says your rtmpdump is not the correct version. But the version you posted should have support for --jtv argument, so either the package is broken or you have another version installed conflicting somehow. Make sure you only have a recent git-version installed and it should work.\n. From the \"/usr/bin/rtmpdump: symbol lookup error: /usr/bin/rtmpdump: undef...\" message I would guess you are missing/have wrong version of librtmp or some other library, if you run \"rtmpdump --help\" manually, you can see what it's complaining about. I'd recommend just building rtmpdump yourself if you can't find a working package.\n. Since this is a issue with Ubuntu's rtmpdump packaging and not livestreamer I'll close this issue.\n. Please run livestreamer with the -e option and paste the output from the error log file.\n. That's not the log I wanted, the output from the command should be something like:\nerror: Could not open stream - Error while executing subprocess, error output logged to: /tmp/livestreamerXXX.err\nI want the contents of the /tmp/livestreamerXXX.err file.\n. Hmm, could you paste me the output of \"livestreamer -c http://pl.twitch.tv/garenatw 360p\" please?\n. The parameters passed to rtmpdump looks correct. I tried to run them manually with my rtmpdump and it works fine, so it seems to be something wrong with your rtmpdump.\n. Hmm, could you link the url you are trying? I do not get the same problem with any streams I've tried.\n. I actually had never tested livestreamer on Windows before today. However, I just tried it and it seems to work fine for me except that is fails to launch VLC, but that's because I don't have /bin/sh on Windows and can probably be fixed some other way. Using file output worked fine though.\nYour error message does look kind of strange, not the way Python backtraces normally look like... could you explain a bit more in detail how you're running it?\n. I commited a few fixes for a few Windows specific things, also updated README with some install instructions that works for me. I've tried it on Windows 7, Python 2.7 and a git-build of rtmpdump from their website and it now works just as on *nix. Hope it works for you aswell.\n. ac006c29ea56af11b1fdb9ef57882220affc687e should fix this.\n. As it says in the README you need a recent git-version of rtmpdump to play twitch/justintv streams.\n. Hello, thank you for this patch. My original intent with regex thing was to be able to handle complex URLs, but I suppose no such URLs really exists for JustinTV/Twitch anyway, so your patch makes perfect sense.\n. I've noticed sometimes rtmpdump hangs instead of getting video data from Twitch servers, but interrupting and retrying a few times usally works.\nIf that doesn't help please paste the output from livestreamer with -c option.\n. Could you try the steps noted here: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/20#issuecomment-8003822?\nThis seems to be a common problem on Ubuntu.\n. I updated the README with a recommended solution for Ubuntu users. Hopefully this will clear up this issue.\n. I'm afraid I can't reproduce this here. Twitch servers can sometimes be slow/weird and not send video data. But retrying a few times usually works.\nThe commandline you pasted looks good, the reason you got that error when running manually is probably because pbs (the library I use to manage subprocesses) doesn't quote the arguments. You can try adding single quotes (') around the jtv argument if you want to see the full output of rtmpdump. You can also use -e argument to log the rtmpdump output to a temporary file, which on Windows should end up in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\temp.\nIf it turns out it is not a Twitch server problem this bug might be the same as #17, but since I can't reproduce it I can't do much. :-/\n. I did some more tests and it seems the stdin bug mentioned in the README regarding VLC 2.0.1 was also affecting version 2.0.2. Try updating to 2.0.3, it should fix the problem.\n. Hi, this is quite the large amount of changes... a few comments below.\nThe manager:\nI believe these features do not belong inside the livestreamer CLI. I think it would be better if you created your own project called livestreamer-manager or something that simply interfaces with the livestreamer library.  If something is missing in the API that can be fixed.\nRemoval of options:\nThis code may not be thread friendly, but it can be easily fixed instead of removing it. I do not like the idea of passing CLI-related stuff like the args directly to the library.\nThe GOMTV plugin:\nI will consider merging this if you fix a few things:\n- Use the existing coding style. This means for example 4 spaces are used to indent, not tabs.\n- Keep the names SQ, HQ etc instead of bitrate, I think it's more userfriendly. Though might want to lowercase them to be more consistent.\n- Add a option called gomtv-cookie to authenticate using cookies instead of username/password.\n- Rename the username/password options to gomtv-username/gomtv-password. Plugin options should be prefixed with their plugin name.\nRenaming the livestreamerrc:\nI agree using the dot infront of the name is not so hot on Windows, so I will probably rename it for Windows only. But simply documenting the path in the README should be enough, no need to have a bunch of backwards compatiblity stuff for this.\nAlso, on github it is common practice to use a topic branch per feature when creating pull requests. This keeps things nice, clean and easily mergable. You can read more about it here: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests and http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches.\n. My vision for the CLI is that it should be very simple and easy to use. Adding a multiprocess manager that very few people will have use for does not fit that vision in my opinion.\n. 1. Check what happens when you run rtmpdump without any arguments. Any linker errors or segfault?\n2. Run livestreamer with the --errorlog option and paste the output from the file specified here.\n3. Run livestreamer with the --cmdline option and paste the output.\n. Hmm, the command line you posted works fine here.\nIt might be a long shot, but your rtmpdump could be linking with the Ubuntu version of librtmp. You can see if this is the case when you type \"ldd /usr/local/bin/rtmpdump\". If it lists the librtmp in /usr/lib instead of /usr/local/lib then that's probably the issue.\n. Well, you can just remove the librtmp package, but if that causes other programs that may depend on the library to be removed aswell then maybe you could just move the librtmp files in /usr/lib out of the way see if it helps. You might need to recompile rtmpdump though.\n. Thanks. :)\n. The way you are specifying the rtmpdump path is wrong. It should be the path to the rtmpdump binary, not a directory.\n. I updated the --help to make it more clear.\n. As the error message says, you need to install python-requests.\n. Thanks!\n. 8337a3912533dfb7d686a453c53adcda783a50a4 should probably fix this.\n. The file you are trying to run is not a Python script. Run it like a exe and it should work.\nUsing GomTV is as simple as: livestreamer --gomtv-username=usernme --gomtv-password=password gomtv.net best\nUsing the URL to the match instead of gomtv.net is necessary if there is multiple matches going on at the same time.\n. Thanks for finding this. I don't do much testing on Windows and forgot to test Python 3. b69a3f96455f3333bc70b67f828cda784fc4ac99 should fix this.\n. Thanks for the info, b61f12ff89f60a5fa14f6daf3f9891e568456df9 implements this. For some reason I had completely missed that Own3d even had a public API.\n. Apparently there are some API changes between the versions, but a7e350fcef93687d36074c00fe8febebf62373f6 should now implement this. Let me now if there are any issues.\n. Had to switch back to python-pbs for now, since python-sh does not support Python 3.3 and Windows yet.\n. Does this happen on all twitch streams on live quality or just this one? Does it not happen on lower qualities?\nYou could try using a fairly large cache in mplayer, something like 8192 or 4096 usually works for me.\n. Do these streams usually work on your connection when using the flash player? It sounds alot like a bandwidth issue. You could also try using VLC with --file-caching=10000.\n. Hmm, I recently switched to python-sh from python-pbs (the library that handles the rtmpdump process) and that might be related. If you don't mind could you try this with the latest livestreamer release (1.3.2, which uses python-pbs) and see if it happens there aswell?\nAlso, if you could use the --errorlog option and paste the contents of the last logfile created (in /tmp) when this happens it could be useful.\n. I did some testing and it definitely happens faster with a lower cache. The change I did in d729d3e5218225beb4ade029bd5a779d87b57e8e seems to make it stable when using a cache size of at least 2048 (it may depend on stream quality though). But since it still craps out with a lower cache this is not fully resolved.\n. Pretty sure two threads were messing with the buffer at the same time. I added a lock so it should be fixed now.\n. The original goal of Livestreamer was to handle only live streams, but I guess there is no harm in adding VOD support aswell. Adding VOD support to the plugin was quite simple so I went ahead and added that myself in dda30f191de4b4e1de050963c2a3e63f318e83b3. \nAs for continuous playback of sets, there are two ways. The easy way is to use the shell to loop through the sets, like:\n$ for set in $(seq 1 7); do livestreamer \"http://www.gomtv.net/2012gsls5/vod/70988/?set=$set\" best; done\nThe hard way would be to join the FLVs on the fly. This would require you to use a FLV library (I actually wrote a FLV library called flashmedia, which is currently embedded in livestreamer, it should be usable for this) to parse the FLV tags, and then make sure the timestamps and stuff make sense and then output that to the player. This is not very simple, but would be useful in livestreams aswell, incase of disconnects for example.\n. @beridoxy The cookie should be a string with each variable separated with a semicolon. Here is a example of what you can put in your ~/.livestreamerrc so you don't need to type it every time:\ngomtv-cookie=SES_USERNO=xxxxxx; SES_STATE=xxxxxx; SES_MEMBERNICK=xxxxxx; SES_USERNICK=chrippa;\nI do not believe the cookies are bound to a specific IP.\nAs for donations, I wrote this software for my own uses and do not require donations.\n. Hi, thank you for your suggestions.\n1. Nice idea, I'll think about adding this. I also think that launching your favourite streams should be easier, was thinking of maybe creating a simple tray app that checks whether streams are online and allow easily launching them. But maybe there are people who don't use a desktop with a tray and then your idea would be better.\n2. I don't think there is anything I can do about this, livestreamer simply allows the player to read the stream. It is up to the player how fast/much it should read, cache etc.\n. Hi, thank you for your contributions. However, your changes do only affect the CLI and I think this should be part of the library. I added it as a library option and also check that rtmpdump supports --socks in 340e4f4be5988e989d1bab150d2913e2d7916ecf.\n. I'm not sure I understand, I did not merge your commits so there are no -S / --socks switches to remove? I used --rtmpdump-proxy instead.\n. Thanks for your contributions, however there are some problems and I made some inline comments. Other than those, please don't mix tab and space indenting. This project uses 4 spaces per indent as per PEP-8 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\nWhen you've fixed these problems you can get rid of uneeded commits by using\ngit reset --soft <the commit hash of the last commit before your changes>\nThis will essentially undo your commits but keep your changes in your tree. You will need to use --force when pushing to overwrite your previous commits on github later though.\n. The --player argument allows you to specify options aswell as player, for example: --player \"vlc --file-caching=3000\". If you really want to use rtmpgw instead you can use --cmdline to see the options and pass those to rtmpgw.\n. I looked into rtmpdump's --buffer but it is not what it seems. The buffer time in rtmpdump is used to trick the RTMP servers into sending data faster by passing a very large buffer time and only works on files, not live streams, more info in the source.\nI will think about adding a buffer layer to livestreamer itself, but for now I made the default player command use a decent sized cache and added some notes to the README.\n. As a side effect of using a ring buffer for threaded streaming on some stream types, there is now a --ringbuffer-size option which can be used to tweak the size of a internal buffer between the stream and player. \nThis only works on RTMP (when using python-sh, *nix only) and HLS streams for now though.\n. Using --player-http added in 1ff89b8c81ddca6231eec85d46d5b0f309391585 will now make VLC use it's network caching settings rather than file.\n. It's probably related to this: http://www.gomtv.net/forum/view.gom?topicid=227468&cid=0&kind=8\n. Yes there is a problem with memory usage right now, this is why I've hold off on releasing a new version for a while. This is caused by a bug in python-sh, but has been fixed in it's dev branch, so it will probably soon be released. You can use the pip version of livestreamer for now if you want to avoid this memory problem.\n. Thanks for the info, I added a plugin in 3b6f5073fab2965a2e1945ad6eafd2f04aa771e9.\n. Hmm, I did some quick investigation and it seems the _alt streams work, but not the normal ones. I also checked how the flash player behaves and it seems to try the normal one first but then failed and went to a alt one instead. So try one of the _alt streams and see if it helps.\n. Own3d usually has multiple CDN's for their streams, livestreamer allows you to try any other CDN's available via the _alt suffix. For example \"hd_alt\".\n. I made livestreamer attempt to use the _alt streams automatically if the main one fails. So now it behaves exactly like the flash player.\n. First of all, cool that you're making a GUI!\nI believe what is happening is that the RTMP server is dropping the connection to you, this is because the server wants to maintain a fairly close sync and it probably drops connections that have fallen too far behind. This would explain why it is also happening when you pause the stream.\n. Livestreamer only acts as a middle man between RTMPDump and the player, so I have no way of affecting this behaviour. You might have more luck if you ask the people behind RTMPDump.\n. You are trying to pass a playlist to a method that expects a variant playlist (a playlist which links to varying quality playlists).\nstream = HLSStream(self.session, playlisturl)\nIs the way you want to use it.\n. Should be fixed with 4f72bfc990302ed00b44eb64e6f073e6b1d29781.\nI have not documented the plugin stuff so you couldn't know this but please don't name the stream \"best\", it's reserved and added automatically. When the quality does not have a name most plugins use \"live\" instead.\n. Hmm, this is strange, livestreamer only tries to open segments that are available in the playlist, so this means that the server lists a file that may not be available yet. :-/ cb4cfc88633664f31f8c0c74f2fe84e0775bc633 handles this nicer though.\n. Thank you for your contributions, I've merged the plugin. \nI've also refactored the HLS streaming to use threads, it should be much improved and more solid now. The original code was written kinda hacky because I wanted it to stay single threaded. But after thinking about it, a multi-threaded approach is the best way to make it work satisfactory and the code turned out alot cleaner too.\n. Hello, sorry for late reply and thank you for your contributions. Please don't put multiple features into one pull request, it makes it harder to review and writing some explation why you want these changes would be nice aswell.\nIf I understand correctly, these commits contain:\n1. Print internal arguments with --cmdline\n2. Print streams differently\n3. Select stream type explicitly\n4. Add a \"worst\" stream\nHere are my thoughs:\n1. --cmdline is a legacy argument that was kept for backwards compability from a long time ago when livestreamer only supported RTMP. What is your reasoning for extending the functionality to other stream types aswell? If you want to access the parameters it would probably be easier to use the API instead of parsing this output.\n2. In my opinion this makes it less obvious that \"best\" and \"worst\" is available for use without reading the --help.\n3. I like the idea but not the implementation, I've added a way to prioritize stream types with 6a8f2341ceea1bdf95eceaf77413c7e248928db6 instead. This avoids breaking existing plugins.\n4. I added this myself with e874b62541d46e73fe8f06c9e3d0f1598ac20692.\n. > To use the data in another language, in my case bash, without a helper python program that retrieve the information from the livestreamer library.\nFair enough. I added string representation to the Stream objects in 5b268a9cf1a157bbd2fecd3e61c110f046680ab1, would adding a --repr that prints the output of repr(stream) be acceptable? (https://gist.github.com/4413714) For example: \n<HLSStream('http://video72-1.justin.tv:1935/app/jtv_rhJMl7mYJmfRu_JL/playlist.m3u8?ushersessionid=14454&wowzasessionid=440821925')>\nI think this is cleaner than trying to fit this into --cmdline since we are not printing command lines anyway.\n\nI argue that this doesn't outweigh the benefit of the information provided (which stream is regarded by livestreamer as best and worst) because the information about the existence of the best and worst keywords is easily available and it shouldn't be an unreasonable concern to indicate their existence through text formatting (as in this case) or unsolicited information (explicit information (the help information for --stream) about their existence in the output that include the list of available streams).\n\nGood points, I think I agree with you after all. The addition of the worst stream made the stream list look a bit more cluttered aswell. So if you could provide me with a clean commit of your previous version (6a357fc4a25f17f0f0b965c472eefff183d3128a) with the following changes, I will merge it.\n- Print only best when both best and worst are the same stream (this is the case if there is only 1 stream available).\n- Use double-quotes (\") instead of single to be consistent with the rest of this project.\n\nI argue that it's better that you influence the commit I've made (ask me to make changes to it) with the goal of committing it (in the exact form you want it to be) rather than create a similar commit as another author. If you don't mind I ask for an authorship review for this commit to determine if I'm the author (and in that case register me as author through commit rewrite or a new commit).\n\nSorry about that, since 6a8f2341ceea1bdf95eceaf77413c7e248928db6 did changes that would require you to more or less rewrite the commit I figured it would be better if I just went ahead and did it myself instead of asking you to rewrite it.\n. No, I did not take any consideration on how easy it would be to parse it but placed higher priority on simpler code inside livestreamer. The CLI was never meant to be used as parsable input in the first place, this is why there is an API available.\nPerhaps you could tell me more about how you plan to use this raw stream information? It would help me understand exactly what you are looking to get out of livestreamer.\n. > As rtmpdump arguments (together with arguments that might not be useful in livestreamer such as throttle and packet size).\nOkay, but if you simply want to add additional arguments to rtmpdump, you could create a rtmpdump wrapper script like\n```\n!/bin/sh\nrtmpdump --yourarguments \"$@\"\n```\nand then pass --rtmpdump \"/path/to/wrapper\" to livestreamer. But maybe I'm missing something?\n. > And remove.\nI still think a wrapper script for rtmpdump is the way to go in this scenario though. The arguments are passed to the script to do whatever you want with.\nAnyway, I'm not opposed to the idea of outputting the internal arguments for external scripting, I just don't want it to be in --cmdline since what we are outputting is not a command line. \nUsing Python's own way of serializing a object would be the simplest approach code wise. But since that is fairly complex to parse, we need another format that is simple to parse but also keeps objects intact. Your proposed format may work now, but what if a stream type is added that needs a dict or list? I would prefer to find a format that is future-proof so we don't need to go back and change it later.\nI'm currently leaning towards JSON since it's widely supported and maps Python objects pretty closely but may not be optimal in your bash-scripting case.\n. Okay, I decided to go with JSON. I also figured it would be a good idea to JSONify the other responses aswell, such as the list of streams and error responses.\nInitial implementation is on the wip-json branch. Any thoughts before I push this to master?\n. I don't really understand the use for this, if you want to pass arguments manually to rtmpdump why not use it directly? The purpose of livestreamer is to take away the pain of finding the arguments yourself.\nIf you simply want a wrapper around rtmpdump for use in a script, you are free to just copy the source (but give credit if you publish something).\n. OK, so if I understand you correctly you want to write a script that gets rtmp parameters from somewhere and pass them to rtmpdump using livestreamer? But why wouldn't you just make the script (the one that fetches rtmp parameters) into a livestreamer plugin instead?\nThe way I see it,\nuser input -> script -> livestreamer -> rtmp-raw plugin -> rtmpdump\nmakes less sense than,\nuser input -> livestreamer -> plugin -> rtmpdump\nor am I misunderstanding?\n. OK, I understand your needs now. I think this could be useful if it includes support for the other streaming protocols aswell. Should probably skip HTTPStream though to avoid conflicts.\nThe way it should be implemented is probably to take a url like \"protocol://url key=value\", and convert it to ProtocolClass(self.session, url, {key=\"value\"}).\n. Sorry, I did some changes to the timeout code and accidenly broke that. Should be fixed with 02fabcb18e7594ba734038df3d4b7c830aa67248.\n. Thank you for your contributions, however I feel this plugin is too specific. I decided to add a more generic version in 82e5ebe2e738ee2c2909152e9908f3e0c0861460 instead.\n. Thanks for finding this, I went with \\S+ instead though in 7f59ae714a4258667e87985fe47bb55f4326c682.\n. Thank you for your contributions, but I think you might aswell rename that function to absolute_url (because that's what it converts to afterall) and move it to utils.py instead. Also, please use lowercase variable names.\n. Yes, that's almost correct. It should be .compat (the dot makes it a relative import), there is still a baseUrl in the function and you wrote wrong name in the last bit. But you probably noticed this yourself. ;)\nJust add the function last and also add it to the \"all\" list.\n. To have a cleaner commit history it would be nice if you could squash this into one commit instead\n. Thanks, for future reference you don't need to recreate pull requests when you change something. Pull requests updates automatically when you change your tree. If you want to learn how to manipulate your commit history you should read a bit about the git commands such as reset and rebase.\n. I added redirect support to RTMPStream in 1431f68af09754fb9ddcdf954a586e1f6f0ec5ab, simply pass redirect=True to it and it will try to find the new URL.\nAs for your plugin:\n- the try/except block in _get_streams makes no sense since RTMPStream does not raise any IOError.\n- you should fetch the webpage and extract the RTMP URL from there instead since it may change\n. Yes, that's good, should probably raise NoStreamsError(self.url) instead of the PluginError though.\n. One more thing, you can probably remove self.PageURL and use self.url instead.\n. In this scenario what you want to do is remove the last commit but keep the local changes, to do this you use \ngit reset --soft <commit hash of the last commit before your changes>\nNow you can make your changes and commit again, but if you have pushed the commit you now remove to github you need to add --force when using git push.\n. Thanks, btw I noticed that your commits are using @gmai.com as email which probably a typo. ;-)\n. Initial Adobe HDS support has been added, however this is not a 100% implementation, so there may be streams out there that use special features of the protocol that may break this implementation. I have only had a limited of streams to test this on but they are working at least.\n. > But this one makes small freezes on my Enigma2 STB every few seconds (probably every time a new chunk is downloaded, on my computer there is no problem)\nAFAIK no video player can play the raw fragments, so I need to convert the stream to FLV first. Unfortunately my FLV library is not very optimized yet, so the CPU usage is a bit higher than I like it to be right now.\nAnother thing to keep in mind in low memory situations is that by default the buffer for fragments is fairly large (10 * , this is around 25MB for a 720p stream). This is because some streams will remove older fragments and that makes it really important to not fall behind or we will be skipping fragments. That's the maximum size of the buffer though, so if your connection is good you may never end up using more than 2-3MB of the buffer. You can experiment with the hds-fragment-buffer option if it becomes an issue though.\n. > Finally something is really wrong with that stream hds://http://enikosflashhd-f.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@36174/manifest.f4m. All available memory and swap is consumed after a while.\nHmm, it seems that stream is no longer live so I can't test it unfortunately. What is the source of this URL so I can test it later?\n. > The error with the above stream is happening although it is offline.\nStrange, I'm only getting 404's while trying to access the fragments, same with KSV's PHP script. Even though the manifest is available I don't think this stream is meant to be played in VOD mode.\nIs the livestreamer output you posted complete? It looks like it doesn't even try to access the fragments for you.\n. Ah, I didn't know about xrange. Also, the reason I wasn't able to reproduce was because I was running it on Python 3 where the range function behaves like xrange. 2668c0b84fa8a2db530a3b41964c761f59c52ede fixes it.\n. > Maybe VLC is able to play raw H264 using parameter --demux h264? \nWe must use a container like FLV or we only get video and no audio.\n. > Sorry for my ignorance, but is there a better (light weight) container than FLV?\nFLV is probably the best choice here, since it's basically a light weight version of the F4V/F4F format that the fragments are in. I don't think it's a problem of format here, it's just my implementation of either the F4F parser or the FLV serializer that is inefficient right now.\n\nDo you believe we can tune add_flv_tag?\n\nI've run the code through cProfile but haven't been able to find the cause of the CPU usage yet. It is not a good idea to do profiling inside livestreamer since timings would be influenced by network I/O.\nHere is a minimal test script you can run to test things: http://91472ed29efc8986.paste.se/raw\nPass filenames of already downloaded fragments as arguments. It uses python-flashmedia directly instead of the embedded version in livestreamer, available here: https://github.com/chrippa/python-flashmedia.\n. > In both cases serialize and deserialize are the most consuming operations.\nYes, I saw that too, but these functions simply call alot of read_xx or write_xx functions and I don't know what I can do to make those functions any more efficient. :-/\n. Nice find, feel free to create pull requests with any optimizations you come up with.\n. Just wanted to give an update on this. I'm working on integrating some of the optimizations you found and while doing so I ended up bascially scrapping the whole PacketIO class and splitting everything up into smaller parts instead. While doing so I also decided to write proper unit tests for each component but writing unit tests is boring so it's going a bit slow. :P\n. I've just pushed some changes that will hopefully reduce the CPU requirements. There still a bit of a burst when a fragment is converted, but I don't think that is avoidable. On my crappy netbook it jumps to about 15-20% CPU usage when this happens, but only for a second and have no impact on playback, so I consider this acceptable.\nOther than that, I consider the actual HDS implementaton pretty solid right now, at least for the streams used by the existing plugins, so I'll close this issue.\n. This looks good, except that RefererHeaders could be renamed to just headers since it's a variable not a constant and playpath can be removed since it's not used.\n. I didn't look into how Livestation works, but if you want to make a plugin that forwards a URL to another plugin you can do something like this:\nplugin = self.session.resolve_url(urlfound)\nstreams = plugin._get_streams()\n. A few suggestions:\n- It would be nice if you split up the handling of RTMP and HLS streams into two methods and then check  RTMPStream.is_usable() before calling the RTMP method. (See _get_streams in plugins/justintv.py for a example).\n- Since HLS names does not seem to overlap with the RTMP names you can drop the _hls suffix.\n- HLSStream.parse_variant_playlist raises IOError not PluginError.\n- Since RTMP streams are optional you don't need to raise a fatal error when channel id is not found, just log it. Same when looking for the HLS playlist.\n- You can use res.json instead of decoding manually.\n- In the case of only one RTMP stream found it could be renamed to \"live\" instead.\n. Yes, except a few small things:\n- You could check if \"stream_name\" is in jdata just in case\n- There is a typo \"No HSL playlist found in url\"\n- You should probably change the \"url\" in the messages to be \"URL\" since it's an acronym and I believe \"on URL\" is more correct English than \"in URL\", at least it sounds better.\n- You can do streams.update(hlsstreams) instead of looping over it.\n- There is no need to raise NoStreamsError at the end, it's acceptable for plugins to return a empty dict\n- Maybe it's just Github but it looks like a indent error in the json loop.\n. One more thing, \nif jdata[\"token\"]:\nwill error if the key does not exist, use\nif \"token\" in jdata:\n. No it's fine, but since token seems to be optional it should be seperate check.\n. This looks good except that the exception when not finding the RTMP URL should probably be a PluginError with a message instead.\n. Seems like you tree has gotten out of sync somehow, you might want to \"git reset --hard [some commit from a while ago]\" and then \"git rebase upstream/master master\", but only if you don't have any changes or they will be lost.\nI've cherry picked your plugin instead of using github merge this time though.\n. By @ streams do you mean \"bbcworld_en_1@s25664\"? I did notice that there are some problems with RTMP streams, the streams do seem to work except that they are sometimes very slow to start. But I think it's just their servers that are slow or possibly RTMPDump misbehaving.\n. The goal of the livestreamer project is to provide a library and a simple CLI only. If you want to do this it will have to be in a seperate project.\n. Sorry about that, forgot to add a .close() method to the new HLSStream, 3f37fb2ccc7eba8d1af08759a3f09ab425a43344 should fix this.\n. 1aac2c23d6fd1e80e6d4d5ff97382becec231759 should fix that one.\n. There is no need to have multiple livestreamer objects, it will just cause unnecessary disk I/O as it loads plugins everytime. The only things that needs to be finalized are the threads, which for example .close() does, everything else should be automatically garbage collected by Python.\nAs for memory usage, you should know that the current implementation of the RingBuffer (a buffer between the download thread and read thread) is rather poorly implemented and could cause memory problems as it does not have a max size and will continue to be filled even if you pause playback. I'm gonna replace it with a new version soon but I still need to tweak it a bit.\n. Looking at the output you seem to running a old version of livestreamer, please check if it still happens with the latest.\n. Thanks for investigating this, @athoik. It seems this commit made the RTMP URLs containing double slashes behave incorrectly, http://repo.or.cz/w/rtmpdump.git/blobdiff/9d6dc72d7c43554dbe8cdb02f450807230df8c25..f3e3e6b507ac0df89a11764abd15cc9535593735:/librtmp/parseurl.c.\nbe1de3278514be7c7b7b209f3f876f118ef29934 should work around it though.\n. Seems like a problem on own3d's servers, I get a PHP backtrace from their server when I checked the output.\n. Seems to be working fine now. I added some more output to the error message now so it will be easier to tell what's going on in the future.\n. Looks like requests 1.0 changed alot. Use version 0.12.1-0.14.2 until I've updated to the latest API.\n. I left it there on purpose since it's such a small compatibility check and I don't think it's impossible someone will end up running that code with a older sh installed. I will remove it later.\n. Thank your your bug report, but I cannot reproduce this. What version of VLC are you using?\n. I see, I guess I wasn't very careful when adding that argument and just assumed it had been supported in VLC for a while. Looks like --file-caching was added in 2.0.\n. I will add support for this soon, but there is a feature missing that needs to be added first. Twitch VODs are split up into 30 min segments, so a FLV joiner needs to be added to support this.\n. > Any update on this feature ?\nAfraid not. Perhaps I was a bit overly optimistic in my earlier post, what I really meant was that I WANT to add it, but I don't know when, there are other things that needs to be done that are higher priority right now.\nIf anyone else wants to take a stab at it, here are some of my thoughts. The place to start is probably to take the timestamp adjust code from stream/hds.py and create a generic FLV concat class that you can feed a FLV tag and get a timestamp-adjusted tag back. You could then create a Stream class that reads tags from a list of Stream objects (for example a HTTPStream for each VOD segment) and processes them with previously mentioned class to get correct timestamps.\nI don't know for sure if this approach will work though, the H264 timestamps may need to be adjusted aswell which would make this alot harder. Using ffmpeg might be the best option if that's the case. While that would probably limit us to the transports ffmpeg supports, that would be okay in this scenario since it's just HTTP links.\n. > Your approach is to feed vlc with fake, huge file and jumping to a timestamp would trigger livestreamer to feed appropriete timestamp from file list to vlc ? I'm I understanding it correctly ?\nMy approach is simply to basically rewrite the FLV container with correct timestamps. Most of this is already implemented in stream/hds.py, but HDS is designed to be segmented so I don't know for sure if the same approach will work on these FLV files that Twitch provides.\n\nCan we just simplify this for now and do it dirty an unelegant way. The first thing that comes to mind is playlist of all files. That way You are able to curcumvent the issue with timestamps. (Leave it for better times :P).\n\nLivestreamer is designed to output a raw stream of bytes to a output, such as a player or file, this is to be as compatible as possible. If we start feeding URLs to VLC or whatever, we suddenly face alot of corner cases where different players use different parameters and it would also make file output impossible.\nIf you want to write small script yourself that simply launches VLC with the segment URLs, the relevant API URL is http://api.justin.tv/api/broadcast/by_archive/VODID.xml. JSON is also available by changing the extension to .json.\n\nAnd as to a proper issue. Can You elaborate on timestams and h264 thing? I have little to no knoledge of it, but when You talked about ffmpeg, You proposed encoding it ? Am I understanding it correctly ?\n\nThe reason we need to mess with timestamps is because if we don't, the resulting output will not be a valid FLV file. The player would play the first segment normally, but when it encounters a tag with timestamp 0 it would simply stop.  So if we adjust the timestamp to continue from the last segment it should be fine, unless the H264/AAC timestamps also starts at 0, in which case we may have a problem.\nI haven't looked at specifics for ffmpeg, but it might be possible to tell ffmpeg to avoid re-encoding by copying the existing data and simply rewrite the FLV container, much like the approach I was thinking of implementing in Livestreamer. But in a worst case scenario it would have to re-encode it.\n. > http://twitchtv.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/new-functionality-link-to-a-specific-time-in-a-vod/ \nThe format described in this blog post is now implemented as of 219420679ee7485124b5b4a21226066c7b2dad2b.\n. I added support for hours a couple of weeks ago (009360fc20fcf36ee09e9e15eb34725992c30187) and will be available in the next release.\n. Alright, you have a point, but at least you could make the output prettier. The CLI is primarily made for humans not machines so I regard less cluttered output to be of higher priority than easily parsable. Something like this would be acceptable:\nFound streams: live (best, worst)\nAnd another thing I forgot to mention earlier, please avoid putting blocks on the same line as the statement, in most cases it's more readable to have more space.\nSomething like this would be a nice way to implement this: https://gist.github.com/4415832.\n. Okay, I pushed my suggested version instead then (2503380a6589d1168e24826fbfdb6079b677b269).\n. Instead of ignoring HTTP streams you could check stream type and then setup the correct stream.\nSomething like:\n```\nurl = urlparse(match.group(1))\nif url.scheme.startswith(\"rtmp\"):\n    # create RTMPStream\nelif url.scheme.startswith(\"http\"):\n    # create HTTPStream\nelse:\n    raise PluginError((\"Invalid stream type: {0}\").format(url.scheme))\n```\nThe cost of setting redirect when there is in fact no redirect would be a longer startup time. The redirect check will wait for 20 secs before giving up on finding a redirect and then opens the stream as normal. If the need for redirect can be determined in the URL with 100% certainty it should be fine, but otherwise the safe thing would be to set redirect to True all the time. \n. Yeah, looks good now, except maybe a tiny thing. Would be nicer to put the params from the PlayerURL in a dict and pass it to urlget with the params keyword instead.\n. Plugin looks good, but your proposed fix for the redirect problem will fail if there is a playpath in the RTMP URL.\nI've pushed a more solid fix in 589f907115ce336b04bdc708ec722f43dadf7133.\n. I don't think this really fits in Livestreamer and will not be added.\n. Since livestreamer simply uses rtmpdump to stream RTMP streams, there is no good way of knowing if a stream has been disconnected or has simply completed. This feature would fit better in rtmpdump itself than livestreamer.\n. GomTV changed streaming tech so the current plugin is broken. I will push a new version that streams using their new tech (Adobe HDS) soon.\n. I have now pushed support for Adobe HDS and updated the GomTV plugin to find these streams.\nNote however, while VODs work perfectly for me, the live streams may have some hiccups but this appears to be on GomTV's end (see http://www.gomtv.net/forum/view.gom?topicid=229020&cid=0&kind=8). Hopefully this will be resolved in the future.\n. > Are VODs also streamed using Adobe HDS?\nYes, the recent leagues (Blizzard Cup and current GSL season) use HDS while the older leagues still use HTTP.\n. > How can we watch gsl on gomtv when we are using an SNS account ?\nUsing --gomtv-cookie should work. You should be able to find your cookies in your browser and then specify each cookie in the \"key=value;\" format. For example:\nSES_USERNO=xxx; SES_STATE=xxx; SES_MEMBERNICK=xxx; SES_USERNICK=xxx;\n. Looks like they changed their VOD player to use HTTP yet again. 7c4c9ab8b3b7201d67f5ad7c7168206b1dc9773e should fix this.\n. > So no HDS anymore?\nNot for the VODs no, the live stream still uses HDS though.\n. I believe that should be fixed with the fix I pushed yesterday. \n\nDo you think the process of the plugin is understandable from the source only? I guess I should learn to fix these errors by myself to not bother you with this all the time... Seems like they are changing their interfaces all the time... :/\n\nIt's really not a problem, since I'm a GSL follower myself but I watch mostly live and not VODs so it's useful that you report it when it breaks. It's usually trivial fixes but hopefully GomTV will settle with this player.\n. GOMTV seems to have settled on both live and VOD tech for now, so I'll close this issue. Open a new issue if there is any change.\n. Sorry, documentation about this is a bit lacking. The --jtv-cookie option expects a string containing the cookies in the format key1=value; key2=value;, e.g _twitch_session_id=xxxxxx; persistent=xxxxx; should be enough to authenticate you.\n. Could you try opening /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/lib/python3.2/site-packages/livestreamer-1.4.1-py3.2.egg/livestreamer/utils.py in a text editor, go to line 114 and replace\nself.buffer.extend(data)\nwith \nself.buffer += data\nand see if it helps?\nAlso, does this happen with streams named \"_hls\" (e.g 720p_hls) aswell?\n. I believe this is related to https://github.com/amoffat/sh/issues/105. I just pushed 8d240b245ae587b961a0110a0ff2a79cb1f7dad9 which should work around this issue. Please let me know if this helps.\n. The Twitch RTMP servers seems a bit slow right now. Keep trying and it will probably work eventually, atleast it does for me.\n. > so the web player uses different servers because it runs fine\nDoes the flash player start playback in less than 30 sec? The servers should be the same, so maybe the problem is that RTMPDump uses a 30 sec timeout and the flash player has a longer one?\nIf you could try running with --errorlog and then pasting the output from the log file created in %TEMP% it may be useful.\n. Seems like RTMPDump have problems fetching the SWF when the URL contains query params. I also think the reason I was not able to reproduce was because some of the RTMP servers do not verify SWF while other require it. 9997890dc38c34a975c0a438fe0e35ebe785994d should fix this.\n. > it seems to happen on own3d too\nI do not believe this is the same issue as the Twitch one. Please provide some more information, like:\n- Does it happen on all URLs?\n- Does it happen on all stream qualities (including *_alt streams)?\n- Output from running with --cmdline\n- Version of rtmpdump\n. > not on all urls, not on _alt\nHmm, livestreamer is supposed to attempt to play the _alt streams if the main fails (this is how the flash player also behaves), is this not happening?\n. > only with best I guess\nNo, it's supposed to work with any quality, this is the expected output:\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 360p\n[cli][error] Failed to read data from stream\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 360p_alt\n[cli][error] Failed to read data from stream\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 360p_alt2\n[cli][info] Starting player: vlc\nIf it does not behave like this then it's a bug and it would be useful if you could provide me with a URL where this occurs.\n. > As much as I love the SWF change you made, how do I update? I'm currently using the windows executable, downloaded it just today.\nSee the README for instructions on how to install from source. You probably have to uninstall the existing version first though.\n. The error you are seeing is because by default livestreamer tries to start the program vlc, but on OS X it seems that VLC is installed under another name. You must find the location of the VLC program and pass that to livestreamer with the --player option. You can save this option so you don't have to specify it all the time, see the README for more info. \nI would like to update livestreamer to find the correct path by itself on OS X, but I don't have access to a OS X machine right now so I haven't looked into a way to find the path yet.\n. Thanks for the info, I made it use that path by default in 021718787c5a68a33830e18aa41780168a3a9d30.\n. I believe this is the same issue as #83, which was fixed in 9997890dc38c34a975c0a438fe0e35ebe785994d. Please try latest git and see if that helps.\n. AFAIK non of the stream types that livestreamer supports can disable either audio/video and the servers will only send them to us combined. If you want to split/disable any of them you can probably use ffmpeg by piping the output from livestreamer to the ffmpeg process. This example will create a flv containing the video but no audio:\nlivestreamer -O url quality | ffmpeg -i - -vcodec copy -an noaudio.flv\n. > Won't that change cause it to continue trying to write to the pipe rather than breaking out?\nThe next iteration of the loop will check if the subprocess is still alive and break the loop if it's gone. I left it like that on the assumption that when the input pipe is closed the player is probably exiting. But it's probably safer to break when the error happens. I'm not an expert on this signal stuff though, so any input on to handle it differently is appreciated.\n. > I don't think you need to poll, actually. The way I would do it is just try to write to the pipe. If it fails (because of SIGPIPE), break. \nYeah, that's true, 6f2167e061b7e80fc4649eedfea89447a181764c should be a more satisfactory fix.\n\n(Also, not sure why you're passing in both player and out in. Why not just player.stdin.write()?)\n\nThe same function also handles writing to files.\n. > I only see write_stream being called in one place.\nIf you look at the output_stream function where write_stream is being called from you can see that the \"out\" variable can be a file object, a fifo pipe or a subprocess pipe. The CLI code is a bit messy right now though, I plan to split it from the library and refactor it in the future.\n. That environment stuff is not really needed by livestreamer, so I removed it instead of patching it in c8094155816b4583a7e5acabc9583ec148c3d4f0.\n. > c:\\livestreamer-master\\win32>bb-freeze build-bbfreeze.py\nThe build-bbfreeze.py script is using the bbfreeze library to build an exe, so you should run it with Python not the bb-freeze command.\n. I decided to solve this problem by splitting into two branches instead.\nThe \"stable\" branch will only contain bug fixes where I can easily create new minor releases from.\nThe \"master\" branch will contain new features and have it's version number bumped and any bug fixes will be cherry-picked onto the \"stable\" branch and released quickly.\n. > This workflow works but you have to be aware that you can't merge stable into master ever. Are you prepared for that? (I'm personally not a fan of this approach.)\nYep, I'm not really that fond of the this workflow either, but I need to be able to push out new releases faster since plugins tend to break fairly often due to changes out of my control. I don't want releases to be held back because a new feature may have some bugs left.\nI decided to go with this approach instead of the one mentioned in the original post since it's less confusing for users IMO.\n. I believe this is the same issue as #83, which was fixed in 9997890. Please try latest git and see if that helps.\n. print repr(stream.stderr)\nThis is the line that seems to be causing the problem, but it's not in my source so you must have added it yourself? If you want to look at the stderr try printing it after it's been decoded in the _update_redirect method.\n. Actually, I did some more investigation and it looks like pbs tries to decode the data on stdout even though we are only looking at stderr. 2548ca52f5774ade2bfad191e1a66e95574db3e4 should fix this.\n. Looking at the Twitch flash players source code there seems to exist a parameter \"force_geo\" that can be passed when fetching the stream XML. I tried passing a few values such as \"US\" and \"EU\"  but it seems to have no effect. So either it's not meant to have any effect on servers returned or I'm not passing correct values. If someone figures out correct values to pass it can be added to the plugin.\n. > Can you tell me how to try different values?\nhttp://usher.twitch.tv/find/channelname.xml?type=any&force_geo=US\nOnly clue about the value I found in the source was that it's probably a uppercase value:\n_loc_1.set(\"force_geo\", StringTools.trim(_loc_5.toUpperCase()));\nI also found another parameter \"force_node\", but when trying values such as \"video4-1.jfk01\" it will still give me random nodes like \"video5-1.jfk01\", \"video5-2.ams01\" in the returned data. So I believe these parameters are old and not used anymore.\n. Doesn't look like there is any solution to this right now, so closing this issue.\n. Are you using the latest version of livestreamer? There was a HTML change a while ago but I believe it was fixed with 4bafff5fe3df5c2cd8c6bfa0d2c25e8c72383fd6. The stream you mention is offline now, but others work fine for me.\n. Does it work normally in your browser?\nWhat platform are you using?\nIf you run livestreamer with --errorlog it will create a \"livestreamerxxx.err\" file in your temp directory (/tmp on *nix and %TEMP% on Windows) containing the output from rtmpdump, it might give more clues about what's going on. \nA workaround may be to try HLS instead of RTMP by using the \"_hls\" streams if they are available.\n. > could you gimme the syntax for changing the player to gom play for example?\nJust put this something like this in your %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc file:\nplayer=\"C:\\Program Files\\path to GOM player.exe\"\nKeep in mind that the quotes (\") are important when there is spaces involved. \nI have not tested GOM player with Livestreamer however, so I do not know if it works. Some players do not support reading from standard input, which is the default way Livestreamer outputs it's data to the player, another way to feed data to a player is using the --fifo parameter, but this method also needs support in the player to work.\n. > What fixed it for me when compiling rtmpdump was to add \"SHARED=\" to the end of the make command:\n\n\"make SHARED=\"\n\nThanks, I updated the docs with that tip.\n. Looks like https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/79 broke named pipes on 32-bit Python (which the premade build is using). I believe the 9e9005c693bdcf3b9e787353bfb347e43a609155 commit might fix it.\n. I believe part of this was fixed with 9241d252c16d57888d30c6b740ee571be35bf102.\nBut there is also another related issue that I believe I've fixed but I can't test it until next broadcast or find some other HDS stream that's using multiple segments.\n. > It seems like you should be using a set instead of a dict mapping keys to True.\nYep, that makes sense, thanks for the tip.\nI believe d456aebe095026239e40fae2a6bec2ea0fa3e656 should fix any remaining issues with the GomTV live stream. But we'll know for sure on the next broadcast.\n. My changes seems to have worked out pretty well, but I also added support for the new RTMP streams they are using in d13e4bc0cee801be132bdf1446bf06a1d8c8c6c7.\n. Hmm, odd. The only difference is that it won't go through another HTTP redirect.\nBut since this is slightly more efficent I applied your patch anyway. Thanks.\n. Running livestreamer with --errorlog and then looking at the file created in /tmp might give you more clues, this file contains the output from rtmpdump.\nIt would be nice to reconnect automatically but for this to be added it would either need to be supported in rtmpdump or be done in livestreamer by attempting to reopen the stream again and stitch it together on the fly using some kind of FLV joiner.\n. > From what I remember playing around with rtmpdump and JustinTV a year or so ago, JustinTV cuts the stream after a few minutes when over a certain amount of people watch it and you're not a paying JustinTV member. Possibly not for all streams, possibly only for non-US citizen.\nIt is true that Justin.tv used to have this kind of limitation, but it has not been the case for a couple a years now, at the very least since Twitch.tv was created in 2011.\n\nThe JSON data rtmpdump expects to be fed even contains a timeout value, called \"promo\" or something to that effect. IIRC it's not that easily changed, because the data also contains a hash of itself.\n\nThis timeout you are talking about is the time the token is valid and has nothing to do with the amount of time you can playback the stream.\n. Should be fixed with 3e9c9ef2962f73735fd09266c40714ca9c97e2ba.\n. I did some testing and it seems like this happens only on Python 2.6 and Livestreamer 1.4.2. \nBut since that release there was a change to use JSON instead of XML (87addbd013f0a8c62cfc9ef732344bea324e9344) so it should no longer be an issue on Python 2.6 either.\n. > I am really wondering why my version differs from yours, although i use the current one (1.4.2)?\nI'm afraid you've missunderstood me, the changes related to JSON was made after the release of 1.4.2 so you need to check out the git source to use the changes. I hope to release 1.4.3 soon though.\n. I'm not sure why you ran into this issue on 2.7.3 though, I have that release of 2.7 as well and was not able to reproduce it there. I'm using Arch Linux though.\n. This is nice, but you're not actually using the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME?\nYou should probably check if it exists and then fall back on the default ~/.config. Take a look on how I do a similar check for XDG_CACHE_HOME in cache.py.\n. I've added a plugin in 556d550acaceeb494d42416b04cd4e8a8c84a9ec. Please try it out and tell me if there are any bugs.\n. The correct command line to use caching is:\nlivestreamer http://www.twitch.tv/peaches__ 360p --player \"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC --file-caching 5000\"\nNote the complete player command should be within quotes otherwise the parameters will be passed to livestreamer instead of the player.\nYou can also save the parameters in your ~/.livestreamerrc like this (no quotes needed here):\nplayer=/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC --file-caching 5000\nDo you get any clues about why the player misbehaves in the console output? (Use --verbose-player to show player output if you are using livestreamer from git).\n. > same as @memco vlc displays loading bar indefinitely for twitch.tv streams (240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 720p+) but it works for mobile streams (mobile_high, mobile_low) osx 10.8.3 vlc 2.0.6 64\nVery odd that it would refuse to play only some streams, maybe you can get some more clues why VLC refuses to play with this command:\nlivestreamer -p \"vlc -vvv\" --verbose-player url quality\n. As raylu mentioned you really shouldn't need to run livestreamer as root. \n\n-bash: livestreamer: command not found\n\nThis is pretty odd, because by installing using pip it should put a livestreamer executable in a location that's accesible by any user on your system. I'm not a OS X user myself though, maybe someone else has a solution?\n\nMy-iMac:~ username$ sudo livestreamer -p twitch.tv/lethalfrag best\n\nThis is not a correct command line, it should be something like this livestreamer -p pathtoplayer twitch.tv/lethalfrag best. You did not specify a player to the -p argument, thus it thinks you want to start the url as a player.\nAs for the problem with the player not starting, verify that the default player /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC exists in your system and is able to start, and if not try specifying the correct path using -p/--player.\n. > Is it normal that i can run pip only with sudo too? Because i only can run pip with sudo.\nThe pip command should be usable by any user on the system, but installing any package globally using it will most likely require you to use sudo. \nHow did you install pip on your system? After some quick googling the command sudo easy_install pip should be the correct way. \nThis guide might help you: https://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx.html\n. Yes, the livestream plugin only supports HLS streams for now. It is currently not possible to fetch the flash streams since the API to get the necessary parameters is using RTMP.\nThis is not something rtmpdump can help us with since it is only designed to download streams, not let us talk to an API in a programmatic way. There are a few RTMP implementations in Python, but they seem to not be compatible with both Python 2 and 3, which is a requirement for any code in Livestreamer.\n. UStream has an alternative API for fetching streams and it seems like some channels are using this exclusively now. Problem is that this API is RTMP based and AFAIK there is no Python implementation of RTMP that is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, which is a requirement for any Livestreamer code. Therefore it looks unlikely that this bug will be solved any time soon unfortunately.\n. > Maybe add the missing AMF parts into python-flashmedia?\nAMF support is pretty much done, but RTMP is a fairly complex protocol so I don't think I will add it to python-flashmedia anytime soon, if at all.\n\nUsing librtmp from python is it possible to use API? (eg https://gist.github.com/athoik/5484842 ) \n\nUsing librtmp is probably the simplest option indeed. I'd rather write some Python bindings for librtmp than patching pyamf/rtmplite to support Python 3 since I don't know if they are even up to date with latest RTMP protocol, at least librtmp is still developed and fairly complete.\n. Supporting discontinuities is not possible in Livestreamer since we do not control the playback.\nWhat is suppose to happen with this playlist is: \n1. Play preroll segment (info about transcode being started in this case)\n2. Discontinuity happens (this resets the video decoder in preparation for next segment)\n3. Start playback of one of the available sub-playlists, switching between them depending on bandwidth.\nNumber 2 is necessary since the next part is likely to be a different resolution/encoding setting. If we were to simply continue to stream the data we would just end up with a broken stream that the player would refuse to play when it encounters changes.\nClosest we can get is to attempt to parse the playlist as variant first, if this fails return a regular HLSStream that will contain the preroll segment. After this finished playing the user will hopefully retry to access the channel and the variant playlist be available this time.\nIn this case though I'm not sure it's a good idea to brute force access to the HLS playlist. I've encounted playlists that are stuck on the preroll with '#PROGRESSED 0%' forever. I might look into what the android app does to see if there is a another API available for HLS.\n. Created a new issue to track status of this problem, #144.\n. It's already implemented. See #108.\n. own3d.tv does not exist anymore and neither does the plugin... I don't know why you still have that file there, it is not in the repository.\n. Sorry about this, looks like there was a bug in the NSIS script I was using to set the PATH.\nProblem was that if PATH is longer than the maximum string size in NSIS (usually 1024), it would corrupt the PATH. I believe I've fixed it now by using a different NSIS build that supports a larger string size and also applied a patch that would simply not attempt to set the PATH if the string would be too large.\n. Thanks.\n. Looks like Livestream started to require SWF verification, should be fixed with ee9cb4354004251f9ecebd9ee4415cf22a2bdf21.\n. Probably related to #113. No ETA on a fix right now.\n. See #144 for status of this problem.\n. What types of streams does this happen on?\nI have noticed some Twitch streams are using an audio codec (speex) that VLC have problems with while mplayer2 seem to handle it fine.\n. You can already do this with --player. For example:\n--player \"vlc --play-and-exit\"\n. Yes, but you need to specify the complete path to VLC. I might add a separate option to make it simpler to just add arguments though.\n. Hmm, try\n--player \"'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe' --play-and-exit\"\n. Hmm, I really have no idea why the Windows shell seem to have these problems, but another fix is to put the --player option in your %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc instead of specifying it on the command line, such as:\nplayer=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe\" --play-and-exit\n. Because the plugin was made for YouTube Live and not guaranteed to work on all videos. I chose not to include it since I do not want to maintain a half-ass VOD implementation when there already exists a good tool (youtube-dl) to download videos.\nThe plugin does not use get_video_page because that is not what the flash player does. Behaving like the original player should always be the goal of a plugin.\n. Not at the moment, no.\nIn the future I want to create a more proper plugin API for common tasks. This would probably include removing the use of the urlget function and replace it with a requests session instead. This session would then also be used by HLS and thus not forget about any needed cookies.\n. As I mentioned I plan to add a proper plugin API that will fix this problem. I'd rather not add a fix that relies on passing a session around right now, I don't think it's very elegant.\n. I thought about this some more while refactoring the HLS code.\nIn 39008e9df12723e59b77c2da428a062ea7e1d857 I added the possibility to pass keyword arguments to HLSStream and HLSStream.parse_variant_playlist that will be used by urlget when fetching any playlists, segments or keys. This includes all parameters listed here and a session parameter to use a existing requests session.\nIt's not as elegant as I want it to be, but it will do for now I guess.\n. Whups, looks like I forgot to rename that argument to avoid conflicts. Should be fixed with 9043ff03f6ea20151ec998906ccf25585c89bc3a. \nHowever, if you only need to pass headers I suggest you just pass the headers argument instead of a session. It's a bit cleaner and also shows up in --json.\n. Sorry about that, fixed with 7c62c56bb00df548da5c7aa8f43e714daae5e0dd.\n. Yeah, adding a --player-args option sems like a good idea. In the meantime you can however still do this by piping the output from livestreamer. For example:\nlivestreamer --stdout url quality | vlc --your-args -\n. With 1ff89b8c81ddca6231eec85d46d5b0f309391585, a --player-args option is now available. Example usage:\n--player vlc --player-args '--an-option {filename} --another-option'\n. Indeed, those streams you tested use the RTMP protocol which uses port 1935. The mobile streams use HLS which is based on HTTP.\n. Thank you for you contribution, but I feel like this fix is overly complicated. I also think waiting for transcode to start should only be done as a last resort if no other streams are available.\nI've pushed a simpler fix as 6865fa7cfc01820133df3ed77118c35fa77a6c4c. \n. Yeah, I like it. Didn't know literal_eval existed, pretty neat tool. I pushed a more generic version that replaces the original int/float parsing with literal_eval instead. So now you can pass any Python value to the streams that accept parameters.\n. Hmm, when accessing the main domain I think returning all language streams are a bit overwhelming.\nI can't test this, but does accessing euronews.com from a greece IP show the greek website? If so, I think it would make most sense to fetch the euronews.com page and extract the language from there and then return only that language's streams. If that's not the case then only returning english streams on the main domain is probably the best idea.\nOther than that, I think the number used in the json result is the average bitrate, so the correct naming of the streams should be \"350k\", \"750k\" etc, and for the secondary streams they should be named \"350k_alt\", etc. This is because the CLI already has a loop set up to try any streams with the _alt suffix if the primary stream can't be opened.\n. This error happened because Livestreamer failed to locate the path to your VLC exe and thus default to try to open \"vlc\". You will have to specify the path to a player in your livestreamerrc. See http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#configuration-file for more info.\n. Cool, please submit a pull request when you feel satisfied with your changes.\nOne small thing I noticed in your current implementation though, please do not use the \"{}\" when formatting strings, but rather \"{0}\". The \"{}\" syntax was added in Python 2.7 and Livestreamer aims to support Python 2.6.\n. > what system are you targeting that only has python 2.6?\nIt is not because of supporting specific systems (although Debian stable used 2.6 until this May when Wheezy was released), it is supported simply because it is trivial to do so.\n. The UStream plugin is currently missing some functionality, see #144.\n. Hmm, pretty good idea. However I think  what you really want is to be able to tell Livestreamer what qualities you don't want included in the \"best\" ranking, I think a simpler approach would be \n--best-stream-skips=1080p+,1080p\nor do you think there is a use-case for specifying exactly which streams you want?\n\nBecause livestreamer doesn't return anything useful to the underlying operating\nsystem it is difficult to script around it without making a full blown program.\n\nI'm open to suggestions on what would make Livestreamer more scriptable beyond the existing --json output.\n. Alright, I've added a --stream-sorting-excludes in 6f3d0254edb6c36ab785f487e10b23fc88b11041 that controls the internal sorting used by the best/worst synonyms. I guess a whitelist version could be added aswell, but IMO a blacklist is more useful since you're more likely to know which streams you want to avoid rather than what's available (odd stream resolutions, etc).\n\nAs for making livestreamer more scriptable, simply return something other than true when a stream is not found or the requested quality is invalid (or any other errors).\n\nYeah, this makes sense, as of 6cef8334708b09808e7fad613068aa375c6b5587 Livestreamer exits with return code 1 when a error occurs and 0 on normal exit.\n. Try running with --verbose-player to see any error messages.\n. Please don't run livestreamer as root, there is no reason to. Try as a normal user it should work as expected.\n. It looks like the file '/Users/Heinsen/.cache/livestreamer/plugin-cache.json' somehow got the wrong permissions. Try removing it and see if it gets re-created with normal permissions.\n. > Now my only problem is that it dosent play anything i VLC. But that is another prob.\nThis might be related to a strange VLC bug, see: http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/issues.html#vlc-hangs-when-buffering-and-no-playback-starts\n. Hmm, did this happen on Windows using the installer?\nI think the problem is that Requests bundles the certs but they do not get included when creating the Windows build using bbfreeze for some reason.\n. Very strange, I must have run into some bizarre bug in bbfreeze. \nThe problem was that in the Windows build that was included in the installer the requests library was included in the \"library.zip\" rather than as a normal directory, which caused problems loading the certs. But when I rebuilt it just now it worked as normal, very odd.\nI've uploaded a fresh installer that should now work with SSL.\n. Strange, could've sworn that used to work... Oh well, rather than changing the documentation I fixed the problem in the code instead so that a wild semi-colon is not causing problems.\n. As @raylu and @beh68030 mentioned livestreamer is indeed only for playback not sending streams. Re-open this issue again if this was actually a problem with playback.\n. No, livestreamer is designed to deal with one stream at a time.\nIt would however be faily simple to script something around livestreamer. Here is a example of a bash script to check if a stream is available:\n```\noutput=$(livestreamer \"twitch.tv/rogtournament\")\nCheck returned status code, 0 is success, 1 is error\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"live\"\nelse\n    echo \"not live\"\nfi\n```\n. The oldlivestream plugin only supports the HLS (mobile) streams right now. This is the output from the HLS playlist:\n```\nEXTM3U\nno live mobile compatible track\n```\nSo it looks like this channel does not have a HLS stream available.\n. > any idea for livestream.com still working ?\n\nhttp://livestream.com/pickathon\n\nThis URL gives me a 404. Did you perhaps mean http://new.livestream.com/pickathon? It doesn't seem to be live right now, but it should work whenever it goes live again as long as you give livestreamer the correct URL.\n. That URL leads to a recording, only live streams are supported in livestreamer.\n. I am unable to reproduce this. Is it possible that you have some firewall that is blocking access to the justin.tv domain?\n. You can loop livestreamer in your shell, it's a bit ugly but it works for your scenario, for example (bash shell):\n$ while true; do livestreamer \"url\" best; sleep 30; done\nMaking this nicer by not restarting the player is a bit complicated and I don't have an ETA on a solution.\n. Ah, yes for file output it's a bit trickier, livestreamer will always ask you if you want to overwrite existing files (unless --force is specified).\nI wrote this small script for downloading streams a while back, it names files nicely and makes sure nothing is overwritten. It's made for Twitch streams, but you can use it with whatever with minor modifications. https://gist.github.com/chrippa/6151877 \nYou can use it like this:\n$ while true; do ./twitchdl.sh joindotared; sleep 30; done\n. If no stream is found it will simply exit. Running it in crontab is not a good idea though, since on each execution it will start a new download if the stream is up. All the script does is check if a file already exists (named \"streamname-date.flv\") and if so it will append a number to the filename.\nPersonally I run it in a screen using the command line I wrote in my last post, this will attempt to download the stream if available and retry every 30 sec otherwise. \nI forgot to mention that it's hardcoded to the 720p stream though, so you might need to change that if it's not available on the stream you're trying.\n. Here is a slightly modified version that will loop and rename any existing files instead. I haven't tested it but should work.\nhttps://gist.github.com/chrippa/6151877\n. This does not work with file output, but using the --player-continuous-http option added in 1ff89b8c81ddca6231eec85d46d5b0f309391585 now makes the random disconnects/stream offline situations less annoying.\n. Perhaps the --stream-sorting-excludes filtering could be expanded into accepting an expression, e.g\n--stream-sorting-excludes \">480p\" # above 480p\n--stream-sorting-excludes \">=720p\" # 720p and above\n--stream-sorting-excludes \">480p;>1200k;>mobile_medium\" # multiple quality types\nWhat do you think?\n. By default Livestreamer will use process pipes (stdin) to send data to the player. This is pretty standard on UNIX-like operating systems but may not be supported by all players on Windows.\nHowever, Livestreamer also supports a Windows API called \"named pipes\". I don't know if WMP supports it but you can try it by using the the --fifo parameter.\n. It sounds like you tried to run Livestreamer by double-clicking the exe. Livestreamer is a command line tool and must be run from a command prompt.\nIf that wasn't the problem, please paste the output from the crash.\n. Thanks for the info, I added it to the docs at http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/issues.html#player-specific-issues.\n. > back to terrorize people. (how do i label an issue, or does the project staff handle that?)\nFor some reason Github only allow admins to set labels. :-/\n\ncurious as to what live.nicovideo uses, and if livestreamer could easily implement it? though i get the feeling the traffic-based throttling is going to hurt something.\n\nNiconico support cannot easily be added right now. This is because while the streams use RTMP, they require the client to send a special command after connection is established. Since the current RTMPStream in Livestreamer uses rtmpdump it's not possible to support it without using a patched version of rtmpdump. \nI do not wish to add plugins that requires special patches right now, since it will easily get really messy if you need a bunch of patched versions of rtmpdump (the exception is the KSV patch set since it's fairly well known). \nHowever, in the future (probably 2.0) I wish to add a RTMPStream implementation based on python-librtmp, which gives us more control of the RTMP stream. Adding support for Niconico at that point should be trivial.\n. @athoik Are you able to use this with any streams not available on the front page? I believe those still require authentication + a special RTMP command.\n. Duplicate of #70.\n. What version of Livestreamer are you using?\nLooking at the error messages it looks like it may be very old, latest release is 1.5.2.\n. Hmm, that's odd, if you installed it in the default location both times it should have been overwritten by the second install.\nHowever, if you installed in different locations, you may have a older version lurking around aswell. So I suggest you search your computer for the old livestreamer and remove it.\nI wonder if there is a way to make the installer detect previous installs and remove them... will look into it.\n. What version are you using? It should pick source in version 1.5.2.\n. Well, --version does not lie, so the executable you are running is definitely 1.5. Maybe you have a conflict with your package manager?\n. This is supposed to be fixed in 1.5.2, is this not the case?\n. > [plugin.justintv][warning] rtmpdump is not usable, only HLS streams will be available\nPerhaps this message is a bit cryptic, but it means that you do not have rtmpdump installed which is required for the desktop streams.\n. > [cli][error] Could not open stream: Installed rtmpdump does not support --jtv argument \nSee http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/issues.html#installed-rtmpdump-does-not-support-jtv-argument.\n. This doesn't really sound like a Livestreamer issue, have you tried asking the VLC people?\n. I haven't been able to verify this since I rarely find live broadcasts on Azubu.tv lately, but the issue with the live_check.png was probably due to the fact that while the channels may look like they are live, most of them aren't, and are just playing the last broadcast.\nThe missing streams should be fixed with b65e783ae6be64b96640d35e611dd804b0190d32.\n. Please provide more information, such as OS, Livestreamer version and full console output.\n. Hmm, that's strange, it seems to error when trying to open os.devnull (this is a kind of black hole file that just swallows data) which is used to hide player output.\nUntil I can figure out why this is happening, using the --verbose-player option to show player output should work around this issue. \n. Actually, nevermind my previous conclusion, I think I was tired and read the line numbers wrong... \nI think the real problem is as @vadmium mentions, that the path to the player does not exist.\nI am not able to reproduce the exact same error though, since the exception raised is caught on my system. I should probably catch OSError as well though, since that's what WindowsError inherits from.\n. I believe the VLC UI on OS X is a bit different (starts in playlist mode, rather than player mode), so you may need to press play to start playback. \n\nAdditionally, is there any feature to record streams?\n\n-o filename, --output filename\n                      Write stream to file instead of playing it\n. Hmm, it's definetly a bug that the exception is not caught, but the fact that it happened should only be because the stream ended or that you lost connection to the stream.\nPlease try running with --loglevel debug to get some more useful information.\n. Hmm, I still don't know exactly why this happens, but I made a change that should work around the problem for now in 857813826e2df36939b2cd7b1d67d36a406ed7a3.\n. For full access to Ustream's services you need to install python-librtmp. It's still under development so there is no release yet, but most channels should work fine without it.\n. Dropping the updated plugin into %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins will override the built-in one.\n. > I can't seem to find the livestreamer folder in appdata? \nIf it's not there you need to create it yourself.\n. Hmm, did you happen to rename the plugin to .pyc? It should be named .py.\nAnd just to be clear, this is the plugin you copied, right? https://raw.github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/develop/src/livestreamer/plugins/azubutv.py\n. You don't need to create the full build (exe) to use the development version of Livestreamer.\nInstalling Python and Pip and then running python setup.py install from the Git sources should be enough. If you have used the installer to install Livestreamer you also need to run the uninstaller to remove it to avoid conflicts.\nIt would be nice with nightly builds, but I don't know how to automate stuff on Windows.\nHere's some instructions if someone wants to try to automate it:\n1. Install python+pip+virtualenv like in the link above\n2. Create a virtualenv and activate it\n3. Install bbfreeze and livestreamer\n4. Run python win32\\build-bbfreeze.py\nA build should now exist in the build-win32 directory.\n. > When I want a new version I should do \"pip uninstall livestreamer\" and then do step 8 again (install livestreamer) and then do step 9?\nI don't think this is necessary, just running install again should be enough.\n. > 1- Is that correct?\nThere has been some changes to the bbfreeze script lately so that it includes python-librtmp. This makes the process to build Livestreamer into a exe more complex since building python-librtmp and librtmp on Windows is pretty far from simple for the average user.\nBut building a distributable exe version of Livestreamer is not something users really need to bother with unless they need to distribute it themselves for some reason.\nIf you want to use the bleeding edge version of Livestreamer you don't need to build the exe though, but instead just install Python and Pip as described in this guide and then running python setup.py install from the Git sources. If you have used the installer to install Livestreamer you also need to run the uninstaller to remove it to avoid conflicts (but you may want to copy rtmpdump out of the Livestreamer directory and updating the rtmpdump path in livestreamerrc first if you intend to use RTMP streams).\n\n2- How do I run Livestreamer?\n\nUnless you specifically need to run the bleeding edge version of Livestreamer you should try using the installer available here.\n. > If I use the installer version 1.6.1 how do I update the plugins? specifically the new livestream fix?\nSave this file https://raw.github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/develop/src/livestreamer/plugins/livestream.py into the %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins directory (create it if it does not exist). This will override the built-in plugin, but make sure you remove it later when the next Livestreamer version is released so you don't miss out on any future updates to the plugin.\n. URLs containing & must be quoted in the command prompt. Try\nlivestreamer \"http://new.livestream.com/accounts/4239881/canalcapital?query=canal%20capi&cat=event\" best\nOr remove the query parameters alltogether since they're not needed:\nlivestreamer http://new.livestream.com/accounts/4239881/canalcapital best\n. Make sure you saved the new plugin correctly. It should be named \"livestream.py\" and not \"livestream.py.txt\" or something like that and be placed in %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins.\n. Git builds for Windows is now available here: http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html\n. This happened because Twitch decided to rename their streams. The \"best\" stream is only able to exist when it can rank the streams, which in this case it can't since it uses a list of names which only includes 'mobile_high' etc and not 'mobile_High' etc. \nI will force lowercase stream names in the next release to avoid this problem.\n. There's been some updates to the azubu.tv plugin lately. Either install the git version of Livestreamer or copy the git version of the plugin into %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins (Windows) or ~/.config/livestreamer/plugins (*nix).\n. Duplicate of #179.\n. Hello, this looks good except that the stream names for the livestreams could be improved.\n- the \"current_video_height\" key in the JSON can be used to make a more useful name, like \"720p\".\n- you should select a \"main server\" and then name the rest of the servers <name>_alt_<server name>. You can either use the first server in the list as \"main\" or use the geo information available in the JSON to select it more intelligently.\n. Looks good, thanks for your contribution. :)\n. > Could it be possible to add also RTMPE support for this program, cos right now those streams are not supported by livestreamer, but they work separately with rtmpdump. \nThis should already be supported, what problem are you having exactly?\n\nIt would be great if you could add HTTP Proxy feature, it's interesting for all kind of HTTP streams such as HDS, HLS and HTTP streams when those ones are not available without proxy. \n\nLivestreamer uses requests internally, which respects the env variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY, see http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies\n\nConcerning RTSP support, when I open it directly through player on almost every stream it stutters often so it would be great if you could add it through livestreamer.\n\nI'm not opposed to merging this if someones makes a pull request, but I don't plan on adding this myself. \n. > For instance how can I open this stream with livestreamer through proxy in command line?\nHow to set a environment variable may differ depending on OS/shell, but this works on Linux/bash:\n$ HTTP_PROXY=\"http://84.22.58.149:3128\" livestreamer \"hlsvariant://http://edge2.vektor.net/vektor_live/bn.stream/playlist.m3u8\"\n. > I use right now Windows. Could you explain me is there any chance to put different HTTP proxy only for several streams and not for all ? I made myself batch file with streams.\nAfter some googling, this seems to be the way to use environment variables for one process only in the Windows command prompt:\nset HTTP_PROXY=http://84.22.58.149:3128&&livestreamer \"hlsvariant://http://edge2.vektor.net/vektor_live/bn.stream/playlist.m3u8\"\n. The command I posted a few posts back works on Linux.\n\nWhy do you use \"hlsvariant\" instead of just \"hls\" for this kind of streams ?\n\nhls:// is for single stream type playlists only, while hlsvariant:// is for variant playlists, which is a playlist containing other playlists to allow multiple quality options of the same stream (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-11#section-6.2.4).\n. Thanks. :)\n. What type of stream is \"best\" in this case for you? It can either be a RTMPStream or a HLSStream depending on if you have rtmpdump installed.\nIf it is HLS then this is to be expected since HLS is not a low latency protocol by design and is usually only used on mobile platforms. For best possible latency you should access the RTMP stream called 'source', assuming it's not locked behind subscription (this is what your web browser is doing).\nYou can tell Livestreamer to only return RTMP streams like this:\nstreams = plugin.get_streams(stream_types=[\"rtmp\"])\n. Do you get any error if you run rtmpdump --help?\n. Do you have any proxy environment variables (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY) set?\nIt looks like requests thinks you want use a proxy, but fails to parse the proxy URL.\n. Hmm, what is the output from this command?\npython -c 'from requests.utils import get_environ_proxies as gep; print(gep(\"http://usher.justin.tv\"))'\n. > {'http': 'http://:@:', 'https': 'http://:@:', 'ftp': 'http://:@:'}\nBy running this command\nHTTP_PROXY=\"http://:@:\" python -c 'from requests import get; get(\"http://google.com\")'\nI was able to reproduce the same error you get, so this is not a Livestreamer bug.\nI suggest you either figure out what is setting those variables and disable it or report a bug to requests that they should ignore these values.\n. Please provide a log of this problem when running livestreamer with --loglevel debug --verbose-player.\n. Try changing line 3 to this:\ncommand = @\"twitch.tv/therainman medium --player X:\\VLC\\vlc.exe\";\nYou are already telling Windows to execute the livestreamer.exe via FileName = path so it should not be in the arguments. Also the order of the url and quality arguments was incorrect.\n. Your are specifying a invalid parameter. The -url here is interpreted by livestreamer as --plugins --rtmpdump l, which makes no sense.\n. > Why would you close it? Removing -url doesn't solve anything.\nThen you need to make sure rtmpdump is correctly specified in your livestreamerrc. Since the reason your stream is not working is because mlgsc2 has mobile streams disabled, thus only making desktop streams available, which require rtmpdump.\nIf you do not want to setup rtmpdump manually you should try using the installer which takes care of this for you.\n. > But that's what I did, I used the installer only. And it shows only some of Twitch streams, not all of them for some reason. It all got installed to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer and I run my .bat from Desktop.\nI see, looks like something may have gone wrong with your setup then. Please try reinstalling and see if that helps, if not, open %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc in a text editor and check if the path after rtmpdump= is correct and exists.\n. > Path's correct and reinstalled and nothing. You can air twitch.tv/mlgsc2 using .bat like mine ? I am on Windows 8 x64.\nI tried on Windows 7 x64 and it works as long as I remove the invalid parameter.\n. Hmm, you're still getting the [plugin.twitch][warning] rtmpdump is not usable, only mobile streams may be available message, right?\nCould you put the full contents of your %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc on a pastebin?\n. Try changing line 32 to:\nrtmpdump=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\rtmpdump.exe\n. > The docu on that file says I have to use \"\" quotes for paths with spaces\nMaybe the wording could be improved, but it says it only applies to the player option.\nOne more thing though, was the quotes there in the file that was first generated by the Livestreamer setup? It's not suppose to be, so maybe it's something going wrong on Windows 8.\n. Right now Livestreamer's plugin API is not designed to collect any metadata, but I plan to correct this in 2.0 probably.\nIn the meantime though, I could add a {url} formatter, it's not great but at least it's something.\n. > Is there any timeline for this?\nNot anytime soon at least, 2.0 is intented to be a complete rework of the plugin system and will take alot of time, which I do not have right now.\n. There was some site changes, plugin was updated to fix this.\n. > How to update plugin to fix in Ubuntu?\nInstall the Git version of Livestreamer as instructed here: http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/install.html\n. Unfortunately the config parser is a bit primitive, you need to remove the quotes.\n. Looks like you've run into this bug https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1379.\nTry upgrading requests and see if it helps.\n. I'm afraid pyCrypto (which is needed to decrypt the stream) is not included in the Windows build at the moment.\n. It will probably work, but you will need to install it in a bit special way:\n1. Download \"PyCrypto 2.6 for Python 2.7 32bit\" from the site you mentioned\n2. Open the exe file in a program capable of opening zip files (e.g 7zip, winrar)\n3. Go into the PLATLIB directory in the file, then drag the Crypto directory into your Livestreamer directory\nWhen you're done you should have a directory called Crypto in your Livestreamer installation's directory. \nThe stream you mentioned gives me a 403 forbidden error though, so I couldn't test it myself but at least it doesn't warn about pyCrypto anymore so it should be working.\n. The first URL you mention seem to not work because it does not use a valid SSL certificate.\nOn the other URLs it looks like they use some additional security. I'm not sure if they're the same, but I tried extracting a URL from the Eurosport link you mentioned in the first post, and it works for me. Maybe the URLs you tried have expired or something?\n. There is a option in requests to not verify the certificate (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification). But it doesn't seem to help in this case, I tried and ended up with a different error instead ([SSL: SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE] sslv3 alert handshake failure (_ssl.c:547)).\n. I was just testing in the Python command line tool, like this:\n```\n\n\n\nimport requests\nrequests.get(\"https://89.216.1.216/CAB/keyfile?r=42&t=DTV&p=0\", verify=False)\n```\n\n\n\nI also tested with cURL:\ncurl --insecure \"https://89.216.1.216/CAB/keyfile?r=42&t=DTV&p=0\"\nand they both reported the same error. Unless both these SSL implementations are broken I think the problem is at the server end and not the client.\n. What is the problem exactly? It looks like it was playing according to the log.\nIt gives a 404 error for me though.\n. Looks like a VLC issue. Even when letting VLC use it's own HLS player it freezes. Works fine with mpv/mplayer though.\n. As of 39008e9df12723e59b77c2da428a062ea7e1d857, you can now specify these parameters in the URL passed to livestreamer. For example:\nlivestreamer \"hls://url.net/playlist.m3u8 params={'v':'clientID'} verify=False cert=('/path/to/client.crt', '/path/to/private.key')\"\n. It's intended that every URL gets the parameters, I think it would be too complicated to try to split playlist, segment and key into separate parameters in the URL. I think it's a very small chance a server would refuse our request just cause it gets some unneeded parameters, if it becomes a problem maybe some special parameters can be added to HLSStream to allow plugins to have some more control over it.\nThe repeated parameter is very odd. I'm not able to reproduce it here. Is it possible that the server is adding any parameters it gets in the playlist request to the segments automatically?\n. I see, well there's not much I can do about that I'm afraid. I let requests handle the merging of parameters and it seems to prefer to keep the parameters in the URL rather than overwrite it. \nA simple test:\n```\n\n\n\nrequests.Request(url=\"http://example.com/segment_1.ts?v=id\", params={'v':'id'}).prepare().url\n'http://example.com/segment_1.ts?v=id&v=id'\n```\n. > @chrippa I extracted Crypto directory but can not understand where to place it. What is \"your Livestreamer installation's directory\".\n\n\nAfter running $ python setup.py install I got \"C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\livestreamer.exe\".\nI tried to place Crypto directory to C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\ but no luck.\n\nThose instructions were meant for the prebuilt binary release of Livestreamer, but it now includes PyCrypto aswell. Since you are running your own install of Python, simply running the PyCrypto installer should do the trick (make sure the installer you download matches your Python version and CPU arch).\n\nI have a stream encrypted by Verimatrix. I can view it with ViewRight Web plugin.\nI extracted my client certificate using traffic sniffer. But I have no idea where to search my private key.\nIs it possibly to find this key and decrypt a stream with livestreamer? Or the key is secured by Verimatrix and is not accessible by me?\n\nI have no idea where to get your key, but if you find it might be possible to use the --http-ssl-cert-crt-key option in Livestreamer.\n. > Livestreamer doesn't support rtmp\nWhat do you mean by this?\n. > Mips\nI think this plugin might require rtmpdump with @K-S-V's patches, but I'm not sure. Maybe the author of the plugin, @athoik, knows more?\n\nThis livestream.com channel doesn't work with plugin through rtmp.\n\nIt was a while since I looked into adding this (#112), but now that python-librtmp is released, maybe someone wants to investigate further and submit a pull request?\n\nIlive changed token (-T)\n\nThey sure made this a whole lot trickier now by hiding a encrypted token inside the SWF. But \n4d94fe18a6c8846f24931c31e1797751c0983017 now implements this.\n\nBy the way, while downloading HLS streams I found that MPEG-TS streams made with Procaster play fine, the ones made with xSplit are completely broken (file size seems to be correct though).\n\nDo you have any example URLs?\n. The Mips plugin should be fixed with 11ff0e42fe65d40d21f98f1a8ba614cedfb8bd13. A RTMP parameter was missing. Vanilla rtmpdump works btw, it does not require any patches.\n\nMeanwhile I tried to install python-librtmp, but got stuck.\n\nBuilding Python modules on Windows is indeed painful. MSVC is required to build Python modules properly. And in this case I also needed to create a \"rtmp.lib\" file to be able to use a existing MingW librtmp.dll.\nLuckily, recently pip added support for the wheel format (this is a package format which supports binaries). I've uploaded some wheels for Python 2.7 and 3.3 (only 32-bit since cffi does not work with Win64 atm). You can install it using this command (pip 1.4 is required):\npip install --use-wheel python-librtmp\nAlso, make sure you also have a librtmp.dll in a directory in your PATH. Though, if you just want to use python-librtmp with Livestreamer, then it is already included in the Windows builds.\n. > Out of curiosity, how did you get rtmp.lib? Did you build rtmpdump with MSVC compiler? Were there no need to rewrite some code of it? MingW made only .a libraries for me.\nI can't remember exactly what command I used, but I was able to create it by first creating a rtmp.def (a text file with a list of all the functions exported from the dll). I've uploaded the files I used here. The dll is cross-compiled from Linux with MingW.\n\nViewed with Softlink SWF Decompiler I see some functions that might help. Still would need to find a way to call them though. Wonder if python-librtmp will help with that.\n\nMaybe I misinterpret, but you can't call SWF functions with python-librtmp. You can however connect to a RTMP server and call it's server side methods with python-librtmp. I think the best place to start is to look what methods are called by sniffing the traffic using Wireshark.\n. > Could you also add support for http://www.iguide.to? I guess they use same system like Ilive. ;)\nNot likely. It seems to use a different decryption algorithm. For ilive I simply ported someone else's code to Python, it's a whole other thing to reverse engineer the algorithm from scratch.\n. > azubutv : http://www.azubu.tv/channel/detail.do?cn_id=2258602895001&menu=3\nThis is a VOD, not a live stream. If the \"live\" image in the player is not highlighted it is not live.\n\nlivestream.com : http://new.livestream.com/popsugar/live\n\nWas fixed a couple of weeks ago with 13cccc804ecf182b0fead69e9c8352bc37f24d3b.\n\nsvtplay : http://www.svtplay.se/video/1542107/svt-forum\n\nStrange issue with the HDS streams only.

This sounds like a good idea and I will probably add it.\nIn the mean time I think --twitch-legacy-names might help a bit. At least when the source stream is not higher quality than what you exclude.\n. What version of OpenSSL do you have?\n. Hmm, I think your librtmp is not correctly linked with OpenSSL somehow. What does ldd /usr/lib/librtmp.so (or ldd /usr/lib/*/librtmp.so if that path does not exist) output?\n. > Looks like you hit something there, I can't locate librtmp.so but I do have librtmp.so.0 \nMight be a Ubuntu thing to not have the librtmp.so, but I don't think it's the problem here.\n\nI've tried just linking it with ln -s but that didn't seem to make a difference, I guess something is missing here?\n\nWhat does this output  ldd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/python_librtmp-0.1.2-py2.7-linux-i686.egg/librtmp_ffi/_binding.so? \nAlso, do you get any error when running rtmpdump?\n. I see, well the python-librtmp has only been tested with the official librtmp. I'm afraid you're on your own if you want to use patched versions since they may introduce API breaking changes. \n. This should be fixed with 39008e9df12723e59b77c2da428a062ea7e1d857.\n\nhttp://94.247.234.3/streaming/francetv_ft3/ipad.m3u8\n\nThere are no comments in these playlists, the segments simply does not seem to exist. If it works in some other player software, check if something special is done in the HTTP request to the segment.\n. > i don\u00b4t have any idea what i\u00b4m doing and i didn\u00b4t find any help anywhere.\nThe documentation for Livestreamer is available here:  http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/\nI recommend you start by reading the tutorial.\n. > the tutorial tells me i have to add the stream in the editor and start the program. everything should work. but it don\u00b4t. so now i have no idea what comes now\nI have no idea what editor you are talking about. The white text after the dollar sign ($ is commonly used to represent the command prompt) in the dark boxes on the tutorial site are commands you can type in your command prompt. \n. > with editor i mean the livestreamerrc file.\nI'm afraid you've missunderstood. The commands in the tutorial are meant to be typed into the command prompt, the livestreamerrc file is only used for settings.\nFor example, open the command prompt and type \"livestreamer twitch.tv/channel\".\n. Looks like there is some connection problem. Are you behind some firewall perhaps? Or it could be a issue with their servers.\n. Actually I see the same thing here, looks like a server issue.\n. This will happen if your stream falls too far behind due to lack of bandwidth on either your end or the servers. Try lowering the quality.\n. I looked into this a while back (#94) but it doesn't seem possible without using a proxy. You can tell livestreamer to use a proxy for it's HTTP requests with the \"HTTP_PROXY\" environment variable, e.g. \"HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9999\".\n. PAC files won't be supported unless Requests adds support for them, which is pretty unlikely since they seem to be written in JavaScript.\nThe proxy in that file is a bit special since it's made for Twitch specifically and blocks any request other than the stream info request so you can't use it with the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. You have to modify the plugin to use it for that purpose only. I don't plan to add a option in livestreamer for this since it's very specific for this proxy and if you have any other proxy you can just use HTTP_PROXY anyway, but here is a patch you can try:\n``` patch\ndiff --git a/src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py b/src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py\nindex 95fd4b0..961bc56 100644\n--- a/src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py\n+++ b/src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py\n@@ -55,7 +55,7 @@ class UsherService(object):\n         params = dict(p=int(random() * 999999), type=\"any\",\n                       private_code=password or \"null\", **extra_params)\n\nreturn res_json(urlget(url, params=params),\n\nreturn res_json(urlget(url, params=params, proxies=dict(http=\"http://173.236.101.38:9191\")),\n                         \"stream info JSON\")\ndef create_playlist_token(self, channel):\n\n\n```\nIt renames the streams though, so I recommened you use --twitch-legacy-names to avoid odd-looking names.\n. I'm just a bit hesitant adding a option that's just for a specific proxy, since using the HTTP_PROXY environment variable works with any other proxy, but I'll think about it.\n. Cool, I didn't know about no_proxy. Then this should work if you want to use that specific proxy without any modifications:\nhttp_proxy=\"http://173.236.101.38:9191\" no_proxy=\"www-cdn.jtvnw.net\" livestreamer twitch.tv/channel\nHowever, I've noticed that some servers only allow access if you are in that region, since sometimes I get this from their servers:\ntv.justin.usher.AuthenticationUtils$UsherAuthException: ERR011: The token is not valid in your country\n. You can tell livestreamer how to name the sub-streams in variant playlists with the namekey parameter. Valid values are \"name\", \"pixels\" and \"bandwidth\". \n. Thank you for the report but this was fixed a while ago (6dd8b40800d77b95e956f2bf85c7b9f989b8c8ea) and will be available in the next release which will be out soon.\n. Remove the -url parameter.\n. > Maybe there is further tuning, eg use the FLVContact or use Tag etc?\nYes, that is probably a good idea. You should be able to inherit FLVTagConcat and override the iter_tags method, put your decryption and tag creation logic here and yield the resulting Tags. You probably want to pass flatten_timestamps=True to it aswell, unless the timestamps start at 0 in each segment.\nA few more things I noticed:\n- Please don't use camelCasing, use snake_casing instead.\n- Split the decryption function into smaller parts, such as create_decryptor, read_create_tag\n- Use StreamIOIterWrapper from stream.wrappers instead of StringIO to be able to stream the segment, e.g. fd = StreamIOIterWrapper(res.iter_content(8192)) and set stream=True on the HTTP request.\n- The Crypto package is an optional dependancy, catch the ImportError like in hls.py and warn about missing library in the plugin if needed.\n. @athoik, this is what I had in mind when I meant you should use Tag:\n``` python\nCreate video tag\nif typ == 1:\n    if config:\n        avc = AVCVideoData(AVC_PACKET_TYPE_SEQUENCE_HEADER, data=data)\n    else:\n        avc = AVCVideoData(AVC_PACKET_TYPE_NALU, data=data)\nif keyframe:\n    videodata = VideoData(VIDEO_FRAME_TYPE_KEY_FRAME,\n                          VIDEO_CODEC_ID_AVC, avc)\nelse:\n    videodata = VideoData(VIDEO_FRAME_TYPE_INTER_FRAME,\n                          VIDEO_CODEC_ID_AVC, avc)\n\nyield Tag(TAG_TYPE_VIDEO, time, videodata)\n\nCreate audio tag\nif typ == 2:\n    if config:\n        aac = AACAudioData(AAC_PACKET_TYPE_SEQUENCE_HEADER, data)\n    else:\n        aac = AACAudioData(AAC_PACKET_TYPE_RAW, data)\naudiodata = AudioData(codec=AUDIO_CODEC_ID_AAC,\n                      rate=AUDIO_RATE_44_KHZ,\n                      bits=AUDIO_BIT_RATE_16,\n                      type=AUDIO_TYPE_STEREO,\n                      data=aac)\n\nyield Tag(TAG_TYPE_AUDIO, time, audiodata)\n\n```\nEdit: Also, please use BytesIO instead of StringIO, it's not available on Python 3.\nEdit2: Also move the tag and decryption code into the BeatFLVTagConcat class and you can simplify the iter_tags method by not touching skip_header and self.tags since it's no needed.\n. Do you have some example URLs for version 1 videos? I think using RawData(data) instead of the Audio/VideoData for version 1 should work.\n. Great, a couple of minor things I noticed:\n- Line 177: The self.closed check needs to be inside the iter_chunks loop.\n- In BeatStreamWorker, you can remove the getChunks method and just yield the chunks in iter_segments without storing them\n- NoStreamsError does not need to be imported\nOnce those things are fixed I think you can create a pull request, nice work :thumbsup: \n. It looks like it's a problem with Livestream.com's HLS transcoder. I'm getting warnings like this in ffmpeg based players:\nThis stream was generated by a broken encoder, invalid 8x8 inference\nAnd it doesn't seem to be a transport issue as letting vlc/mpv/ffplay do the HLS transport itself (--player-passthrough hls) doesn't change anything. I guess the best solution is to add support for the RTMP stream in the plugin, assuming it's playable.\n. You need to have a {filename} in your -a argument for playback to work, try -a \"--config C:\\Users\\Me\\Desktop\\vlcrc {filename}\".\nAlso, you need to remove the pound sign (#) from your vlcrc or it will be counted as a comment.\n. > Not sure if this is intended, but I ditched the directory info, because it just created a renamed vlcrc file in the livestreamer directory called UsersMeDesktopvlcrc and VLC used that. \nThis is a bug. It's caused by shlex removing bash-slashes that are not escaped. I fixed it for the --player option but forgot to also do it on --player-args it seems.\n. What version of requests 2.0 do you use exactly? I have tested it both with 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 and have not run into this issue.\n. It looks like requests 2.0 uses an attribute that was not available until Python 2.6.3. I changed setup.py to force 1.x on those versions with 0ebafa76dc242b906715f594b3d646b26f023f22.\n. This used to be the case, but it was brought to my attention that version 1.x of VLC does not support the --file-caching option and instead caused an error, so it was removed.\nI am considering making the --player-http option the deault in the future so that the network caching value will always be used instead since it will transport the stream over HTTP instead of a pipe.\n. Well, there is already some info about this here: http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/issues.html#streams-are-buffering-lagging\nI guess I could put it into the tutorial section aswell.\n. Nice fixes, thanks.\n. Hmm, I think this could be improved a bit.\n- Since you describe the process of getting a pvhash from a SWF, we might aswell just accept a swf argument instead and then create the hash ourself.\n- The urlappendix doesn't seem needed, you can just put the query params in the rsession.params dict instead. This also takes care of any quoting needed.\n- Don't use the logger to report the error about missing an argument when a pvtoken is found in the manifest, raise a IOError exception instead.\n. > That would probably be a good idea, though I think it should also try to cache the hashes to avoid needlessly downloading the SWF over and over, similar to what \u201crtmpdump --swfVfy\u201d does (though the hash method is different). I thought this would be a significant amount of work, but now I found you already have some generic caching support, as used in revision 85eb4fa. I\u2019ll use that as a base, and hopefully add an \u201dIf-Modified-Since\u201d HTTP condition if it\u2019s not too hard.\nYeah, that makes sense, I suggest you add a Cache object to the Stream base class similarliy to how the Plugin class does it. \n\nWill do, although I think I\u2019ll need to parse apart the name=value halves of one of the params, which comes directly from the  element.\n\nYou can use the parse_qsd function (dict version of parse_qsl from urllib.parse) from utils for this.\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Hmm, I guess checking the date format is not really necessary. The HTTP spec does not even seem to specify a specific date format, it's simply advised to use the Last-Modified header from the server, whatever that may be. But since we write this to disk we should probably check that it's not abnormally long at least.\n. Since the Python documentation recommends not to mess with the locale in a library and the fact that we don't need to parse the date I've decided to just use a length check instead to keep it simple.\n. Do you have a example URL?\n. It seems like channels that are in \"replay\" mode return a stream that does not return any data. Would it be possible to either support the \"replay\" video stream or simply return no streams on such channels?\n. Make sure librtmp is also updated. If that doesn't help, try running with --errorlog and then find the log file in /tmp and paste the contents.\n. The fragment 404'ing in your log is no longer returning 404 so it was probably just some temporary glitch on their server.\n. Did you use the zip or installer version of Livestreamer?\nIf zip, then you need to download rtmpdump and configure it yourself in %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc like this:\nrtmpdump=C:\\path\\to\\rtmpdump.exe\nIf you used the installer, please paste the contents of your %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc file. The installer is supposed to have taken care of rtmpdump setup automatically.\n. > From experience with MPC-HC + Livestreamer it's worth noting that if you let it buffer for \"too long\" it will close out.\nI'm not sure, but I think what's happening here is that if you pause for too long the buffer in MPC-HC will get full and thus stops reading data from Livestreamer which also causes Livestreamer to stop reading data from the stream and will probably be dropped by the server for being idle.\nYou can however tell Livestreamer to keep reading data from the stream even if the player stopped reading data from Livestreamer by increasing the ringbuffer size with --ringbuffer-size. For example you could use --ringbuffer-size 268435456 to allow up to 256MB to buffer (this is a bit extreme but would probably allow you to pause for 30 min or more depending on stream quality).\n\nAfter trying every option and tweaks, I tried to use livestreamer rtmpdump url and play it on XBMC. I watched it on Source(best) without any lags in two days. It would be nice if livestreamer implement some simple plugin (xbmc uses python, so it shouldn't be too hard. Maybe even I'll do it myself ^^)\n\nIf you only need Twitch you could try https://github.com/StateOfTheArt89/Twitch.tv-on-XBMC.\n. Your OS X version ships an older version Python 2.6 that is not compatible with requests 2.0. Try downgrading your requests to 1.2.3 (pip install requests==1.2.3) or upgrade your Python version.\n. I don't know what that error means but you could try upgrading your VLC if it's not the latest and make sure it can play other H264 content aswell to rule out any codec issue.\n. On what stream URL does this happen?\n. Hmm, this is really strange.\nI did some testing and it seems like if you use the rtmpdump command from --cmdline manually, then the outputted file will have a duration. At first I thought it was some bug in pbs (a subprocess wrapper Livestreamer uses) but even when using a minimal test case (https://gist.github.com/chrippa/b4a9803da6df3dcd1f7a) it produces a file with no duration.\n. > \u201crtmpdump\u201d might be doing some file cleanup when you interrupt it\nLooking at the source that does not seem to be the case, I thought it would update the duration metadata in the header, but that is not the case as the duration field is set to 0.0 on both files.\nI also tried to use librtmp directly to read the stream via python-librtmp and it produced a file with correct duration and there is no seeking involved there.\nBut there is something going on with the pipes I think, as when I tried to pipe it through cat as you suggested it produced a file without duration aswell.\nMy current theory is that the players are unable to figure out a duration if the file ends without a complete FLV tag. I think what happens is that RTMP_Read will always round off the data at a tag ending, but when we read from a pipe we can end up with tags broken up in pieces. Thus if the stream reading is interrupted before the stream is complete we may write a incomplete tag at the end of the file.\nI don't think there is a simple fix for this, best option is probably to use python-librtmp for stream reading in the future. But I don't really consider that binding mature until cffi has reached 1.0 so I don't want to make it default just yet.\n. > Are you able to reproduce this issue? If not I'm willing to test some stuff for you guys.\nYes, I was able to reproduce it. I'm pretty sure my theory is correct now, since I wrote a small script that verifies that all the tags are complete and discards any that aren't. This script fixed my test files, and it also fixed the incorrect duration on the file you just uploaded.\nThis issue should probably not happen unless you interrupt the stream though, if it reaches end naturally it should work as expected. A workaround is to make a small script that just grabs the rtmpdump command line from livestreamer --cmdline and adds -o <filename> to it to let rtmpdump handle the file output.\n. The script expects livestreamer to be installed, if you're on Windows you should be able to drop the script in the livestreamer directory and run it from there.\n. Looks like python eggs aren't picked up for some reason, try putting it in the sub folder named livestreamer-1.8.0-py2.7.egg instead.\n. I've changed the veetle plugin (2027bd53007ffc28a379a0fcd87d095df6673505) to verify the FLV tags before writing them, this should probably fix the issue of multiple FLVs in a single stream.\n. I left some comments on your code, please check and correct the plugin as necessary. Also run pep8 on your code to fix any style issues (long lines are ok to leave as is).\nWhen you are done you should commit your changes and then merge your commits into a single one by using interactive rebasing (git rebase -i <commit-hash-of-the-last-commit-before-yours>). This will rewrite your history so you need to forcefully push your changes to Github (git push --force).\n. I'm not sure if this will help your issues, but you may want to try using the --player-no-close option. By default Livestreamer will close the player when the stream is over, but if the player has cached a decent amount the stream may seem to end abruptly.\nThis behaviour has been around since the first version of Livestreamer since I wanted to close the VLC GUI after the stream was over. But I realize this is not very optimal for VOD content and I will consider changing it in the future.\n. Ah, I see. I don't know if omxplayer prints any output, but if you run with --verbose-player you can see it and it might help finding out whats going wrong.\n. @vadmium is there any downside to always do the wait call? Seems like the sensible thing to do even if we send a kill signal first.\n. > Or do you mean calling wait in all cases, and dropping the behaviour of letting the player run in the background?\nI'm pretty sure we always need to have the player as a background process unless we want to use a thread for  the stream IO. But I meant that we probably don't need another command line option and can just do the wait call in all cases.\nIt was a while since I wrote the original player code, but I don't think there was any reason that I left the wait out. So I think as long as we close the input before waiting it should be fine.\n. Thanks, but please use rebase instead of merge to bring your tree up to sync next time. I don't want your merge commits in my tree. :)\n. I'm afraid the first patch is no good. We can't quote the cmd here or it would result in values such as \"player --arg\" not getting split. It should already be possible to use a player path with spaces by quoting it yourself, e.g --player \"'/c/Program Files (x86)/VideoLAN/VLC/vlc'\".\n@vadmium We must use shlex.split to support player values such as \"player --arg\".\n. Works fine here, do you get any errors?\n. Twitch has done a major overhaul of their video system and has retired the RTMP streams and only use HLS now. The next Livestreamer release will update the plugin properly for these changes, but the HLS streams should be available as mobile_* streams in Livestreamer 1.7.1.\nPlease verify that you actually are running 1.7.1 with livestreamer -V, I was not able to reproduce your issues on this version.\n. Put this in your configuration file:\nrtmpdump=C:\\path\\to\\your\\rtmpdump.exe\nDid you try using the installer? It will do this for you automatically.\n. It looks like you may have put some invalid parameters in your configuration file.\n. It looks like you are actually running an older version of Livestreamer. If you have installed Livestreamer in a different directory before but forgot to uninstall it, it may be causing a conflict with the new version.\n. Does this also happen with --player-passthrough rtmp,hls?\n. Hmm, then it looks like a problem with mplayer2, since that option essentialy makes livestreamer only grab a URL and pass it to the player without doing any transport. \nHave you tried mpv (another mplayer fork)? I'm using it myself without any problems.\n. Thanks!\n. I think this may be a bug with VLC's pulseaudio output. I also ran into this after upgrading VLC to 2.1, when using the pulseaudio output module I got the same issue as you, but when I switched to the ALSA module (I use a asoundrc to forward ALSA audio to pulse) I didn't get it any more. \n. > config: http://pastebin.com/1xSjU1Zw\nIf you look at line 14 and 21, you'll notice that you removed # from lines that were originally comments, thus causing your error as they are interpreted as options instead.\n. Do you use some proxy/VPN that might mess with your HTTPS traffic? Does Twitch work in your browser? What OS are you using?\n. > Maybe a command line option could take care of this?\nYes, I'm currently working on a overhaul of the internal HTTP usage in Livestreamer and that will make it possible to add a --http-no-ssl-verify option.\nBut that is still just a workaround. So far I've figured out that there is something funky with the certificate Twitch is using, which is signed by Godaddy. The Crunchyroll plugin is also having this issue and it is using a Godaddy certificate aswell.\nIt's unknown what exactly is causing this but it is known to happen when using version 20140223-1 of the ca-certificates package in Arch Linux. If this turns out to be a widespread issue it might be worth setting verify to False in the affected plugins though.\n. I opted for a sligthly different fix in 5f6a3d3fe24f50b161be66e711db2989eea1e378. Thanks for your effort though.\n. The playlist is containing multiple playlists with same bitrate/resolution but only the first one of each quality is not returning 404. The problem is that Livestreamer is always choosing the last playlist specified for each quality while VLC is using the first it finds. The spec doesn't seem to specifiy how this should be handled, so I guess we could change the behaviour to match VLC.\n. This is a limitation of the current plugin. The #112 issue will be updated if there is any changes.\n. Looks good, I found a few minor issues though:\n- You made a typo on line 225, should be warning, not warn\n- You added --crunchyroll-purge-credentials to playeropt, should be pluginopt\n- Add the new CLI options to docs/cli.rst\n- Add yourself to AUTHORS if you wish\n- Add stream weights, see src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py for a example on how to do this.\n- The 'adaptive' stream returned is actually a variant playlist containing the 'mid' and 'high' streams and should be ignored since Livestreamer doesn't support adaptive streaming.\n- You marked the plugin as capable of handling live streams in docs/plugin_matrix.rst, but the only live stream I found is on http://www.crunchyroll.com/live which ended a long time ago. So I assume it hasn't been tested or not supported at all in the plugin? Or are there other live streams?\nAnd yes, I would prefer it if you squashed the commits.\n. Great, thanks!\n. What steps did you do exactly?\nThese steps should work fine:\n1. Type %appdata% into the address bar of the Windows file explorer\n2. Right click in the directory and create a \"livestrearmer\" directory (if it does not already exist)\n3. Create your configuration file in a text edtior and save it in the directory you just created as \"livestreamerrc\". Make sure you save it as \"livestreamerrc\" and not \"livestreamerrc.txt\".\n. Since Livestreamer is focused on live streams and not VODs it is not part of the design to support seeking at the moment.\nYou don't mention what type of VOD you're trying to use, but the Twitch plugin has special support for seeking into broadcasts since this was required to implement the \"highlight\" type VODs. This is done by using the t parameter. Example URL: http://www.twitch.tv/liquidhero/b/297908075?t=102m38s\n. I'm not able to reproduce this. I also get a few errors, but they don't cause any problems. Could you paste a log with the errors?\n. Well, the fact that is works sometimes but not always may mean my implementation of their streaming protocol is not correct. I was able to reproduce the issue on the second channel you posted. This channel works consistently for me though, is it the same for you?\n. I've pushed some changes to the ustream streaming which I believe should fix most issues, please try the latest git version.\n(Windows builds can be found here: http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html)\n. > I would then get the following error when I tried to play it with VLC:\n\nNo suitable decoder module:\nVLC does not support the audio or video format \"undf\". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.\nThe file will play audio, but no video.\n\nI believe what is happening is that sometimes a segment will only contain audio, and even if the next segment contains video it will end up confusing at least ffmpeg based players since it seems to rely on scanning the first few FLV tags to see what it contains.\nWe might be able to work around this by analyzing the stream and not outputting segments until we found one which contains both audio and video.\n\nI need to do some more testing to see if this is a time dependent thing, I know it happened as soon as I started livestreamer one time, but not usually. I was outputting to a file, not to VLC directly. Funny thing is, I was using RTMPDump and RTMPSuck for awhile, but Usteam must have changed something recently since RMTPSuck won't work on it anymore but livestreamer does, to a point. I can't find the command line string for RTMPDump.\n\nUStream has pretty much dropped the usual  RTMP streams and are now using a special RTMP + segmented HTTP stream type which Livestreamer attempts to implement. But the implementation is based on reverse engineering the protocol so it's not perfect yet.\n\nAlso, not sure if this is normal, but the \"Written\" size increases fast for a short time, then stops for some time. It appears that when this stops, the file gets written to. I believe this may cause the end of the output file to get truncated when the stream ends since it exits before the file is fully written. I still need to test this more. \n\nThe start and stop is happening because the UStream server gives us a list of FLV segments in bursts every few seconds, so it is not because of disk I/O and no data should be lost.\n\nAlso not sure why the quality is being detected so low. At home (slower connection), I get 720P on most streams but at work they are only \"mobile_240p\" or \"mobile_480p\".\n\nThis error\n\n[plugin.ustreamtv][error] Unable to fetch desktop streams: Failed to connect to\nRTMP server\n\nseem to indicate that your work firewall is probably blocking the connection to UStream's RTMP server which is required to access the streams normally found in the web player.\n. I believe the audio only issue should be fixed with 1816c69de0224e6a1d0a8688e6008f9aaea49d15. What happened was that sometimes the H264 header came a few seconds after the AAC header in a segment, this caused a desync which confused player software. We now wait for both headers to make it all synced up. \n. Please run with --loglevel debug in the future, it contains some extra information. I haven't been able to reproduce this myself, watched about 45 min of that stream.\n. It looks like the thread that is responsible for fetching the segments gets stuck. Most likely what happens is that the HTTP request never times out, which is probably caused by a bug currently existing in the HTTP library we use (requests) where the timeout is not applied to streaming responses (it will be fixed in the next version though).\nI've pushed a workaround that will attempt to downlaod the whole segment in one go which should make the timeout work correctly. Downside with this approach is that we have to wait for each segment to be fully downloaded before it can be sent to the player.\n. You might want to try using an alternative CDN if you're having trouble with many missing segments, e.g. 720p+_alt_akamai. It's suprising you would end up with missing segments in the first place though, as it attempts to download each segment 3 times. I have never seen a segment download fail more than once.\n. Are you referring to 5ebf5af0933f899ce7b7c3e3f73378ce9a50348e? The timeout stuff referred to there only affects streaming responses, which the ustream plugin does not currently use.\nAbout your issues, it is likely my implementation is slightly wrong since it's based purely on analyzing the network traffic. I have to decompile the flash player to get a better look how this works, but haven't gotten around to it yet.\n. Ah, right, I changed the plugin to use non-streaming responses with 3c3e81deff6d8dd934002bc08a596dbb6276f26e though, so that is not an issue anymore.\n. Streaming the segments is better in theory since it allows data to flow faster to the output. But in case of errors it can cause incomplete segments to be written, with non-streaming segments we instead get either the full segment or skip it completly (it gives up after 3 attempts to download it). Since we live in a world were internet connections are not always perfect I think going with non-streaming segments is the safest, and I'll probably change other streaming types (HLS) to do the same aswell.\n. No, that's not what's happening, there are precautions in place to prevent issues like that. I accidently made the stream think it had one less segment available than it really has in d3a843bc9a83b5a625a60a02b428f4581ec4aa0d, but I've pushed a fix now.\n. > I am using the --retry-streams option and at times it won't capture the beginning of cuts off the end.\nI did some testing by sending a stream myself to ustream and it seems there is a delay from where I start the stream on my end and when ustream will let me access it, it's usually between 15 and 30 seconds, is that what you're seeing?\nI actually noticed a big bug where writer thread could be ended prematurely by the worker thread and I've pushed a fix, this was likely the cause for missing data at the end.\n\nThe other issue that is more peculiar, is that it, at times, will not sync the audio and video. I was trying to do some testing on this but think it only occurs when outputed to a file, not to VLC.\n\nThis is really odd, we have code that will make sure any gaps from missing chunks will be fixed by adjusting the timestamps. I've tested this by telling the stream to ignore some chunks, and it always works correctly both on file and in player.\n. This is not a HLS playlist. It looks like a smooth streaming  playlist, which is not supported by Livestreamer.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this. Does it also happen if you use --player-passthrough hls?\n. No stutter at all, the music plays perfectly. Are you using any caching? I've noticed VLC can be a bit strange if it does not have any cache sometimes.\n. Is everyone who has this issue using VLC?\n. Hmm, if you write the stream to a file (-o filename.ts) first, does it download?\n. Thanks for investigating. I believe this should now be fixed. If you wish, you can try the latest change with this build: http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/livestreamer-v1.7.4-22-g7697937-win32.zip\n. Livestreamer uses requests to do the transfer of the stream. Unfortunately requests does not support SOCKS proxies at this time.\nA workaround however, is to use the  --player-passthrough hls option to forward the stream URL to the player instead of transporting it in Livestreamer and then setup your player to use a proxy. I believe VLC has support for SOCKS.\n. Does this only happen on this specific channel? I tried a bunch of channels and was not able to reproduce this error.\n. Hmm, I'm gonna need you to modify the plugin to add some more debug info.\nAdd this to line 54 in src/livestreamer/plugins/hitbox.py and run the setup again.\npython\n        print(json)\nThen paste the output from livestreamer.\n. Add it on the line after bitrates = ....\n. I have no idea why your JSON result is different from mine, but it should be fixed with e3423a4cb5a22ab56243b4f0af9acc1a5794d9bc.\n. I'm a bit confused what you mean by black screen? Does it work if you use a player that doesn't use -n (fifo)?\n. As @vadmium mentioned passing headers works with some URLs, (hls://, hlsvariant:// and httpstream://) but this is kind of hacky. The problem right now is that there is no common HTTP session between the plugins and the streams that they create.\nThe plan is to create a HTTP session in Plugin.get_streams() and then make sure everything uses that. This would then make it trivial to setup things like headers and it will all get passed along nicely down to the streams. I've added this to the roadmap for 1.8.\n. Try putting some cache options in your configuration file. Keep in mind though that Livestreamer is not a magical fix for connection issues.\n. Livestreamer is a command line tool, if you're not familiar how to use the command prompt I suggest you google that first and then follow the tutorial for Livestreamer.\n. Try pip install --upgrade livestreamer.\n. > OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/livestreamer-1.5.2-py2.7.egg'\nYou need higher permissions to write to this location. Try the command with sudo.\n. Not all players are able to read data from the standard input pipe. Using --player-http or --player-fifo might help.\n. I think this should be fixed with dd3447f0298af051c1b4d2304cb90b72414e91e5.\n. Livestream.com is already supported, what channel are you having trouble with?\n. As @karlo2105 mentioned only HLS streams are supported in the plugin currently. You mentioned in your first post that you know how to access these streams, perhaps you could share your findings or contribute a patch?\n. Closing this to keep all related discussion in one issue (#112).\n. Twitch does not use RTMP anymore, they are using HLS which uses --http-proxy.\n. --http-proxy only works with HTTP proxies not SOCKS like Putty creates. If you want to use a SOCKS proxy you can use --player-passthrough hls (this passes the HLS URL to VLC) and then set your proxy in VLC settings.\n. Using --player-passthrough hls might help you with your audio issue as reported in #267. But if you want to record video you do not need to use VLC, you can use -o filename.ts instead to make Livestreamer write to a file directly.\n. It should be part of the URL, e.g. http://www.twitch.tv/liquidhero/b/297908075?t=102m38s\n. It seems you have a file located in the default VLC path, this is why it attempts to use it, but it fails to execute for some reason.\nWe currently only do a simple check in common directories to find a player, if you have any suggestions on how this could be improved I would appreciate it.\n. > Perhaps you could check system environments?\nDo you mean environment variables? The only useful information there is the correct name for \"Program Files\", and we already use that.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Please paste the output from livestreamer --json <channel>.\n. Hmm, that's the exact output I get aswell so we are using the same server and parameters. But I do not have any problems playing the stream here. Maybe you have a firewall blocking port 1935?\n. Hmm, it's odd that it works in the browser for you. I tried to block port 1935 on my computer just to see if I would reproduce the same error. I got the same error but the web player did not work for me so it's not like the web player is falling back on port 80 or something.\nTwitch is unrelated here since it does not use the same streaming protocol as hitbox and dailymotion.\nThere is one more thing you can do to provide some more debug info, run livestreamer with --errorlog and then open the directory %TEMP% and find the last file created there, it should be named something with livestreamer and paste contents here.\n. I also get that warning so that is not the cause. I don't know much about Windows firewalls but, is it possible you have one enabled but with an exception for your browser?\n. That is intended, as mentioned on the download page the zip does not contain rtmpdump and is meant for people who only want a minimal download.\n. I don't really know why, but if you run with one these options: --player-http, --player-continuous-http or --player-fifo together with --verbose-player it works.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. No, it's not possible right now. Do you have an example of a channel with password?\n. > This one: http://ustream.tv/racefansonly2015\n\"Sorry, the page you requested cannot be found.\"\n. I believe both the mobile app and web player uses a custom a stream protocol which we do not support. The only streams we can use are the HLS streams found on the mobile website meant for iPhone/iPad (m.afreeca.com), which I believe do not support HD since you can't even login there.\n. Thanks!\n. It's stuff like this the API is for.\nI don't know what software you are using to analyze the video stream with, but I think the correct way of doing this is to continously read the stream from a pipe and feed it to your analyzer and not using temporary files.\n. Livestreamer will only transport the stream, you'll need something else to do the decoding, such as ffmpeg. \nHere's a couple of links that may be helpful:\n- Create a thumbnail image every X seconds of the video\n- Read and Write Video Frames in Python Using FFMPEG\n. That's nice, but please add it to the wiki and/or write a post on the mailing list. The issue tracker should generally be used for issues/feature requests.\n. The -p parameter is really meant for actual players, but you can pipe the data instead, e.g.\nlivestreamer -O url stream | ffmpeg -i - test.flv\n. Thanks!\n. All the channels you mention works perfectly for me, both on high and low.\n. Well, the player also needs to be able to stream over HTTP. Try running with --verbose-player to see if omxplayer prints any error.\n. Thanks!\n. Please explain what you mean by putting the stream into xsplit? I don't know much about xsplit but doesn't it just capture your screen including the video player?\n. Is this on a specific stream? I just tried watching a few of the top streams and they worked fine for more than 5 min.\nYou can automatically reconnect to streams you get disconnected from if you use --player-continuous-http and set your player to repeat mode, maybe it will help here?\n. The Youtube plugin is primarily made for live streams, it just happens to work on most videos aswell. Try using youtube-dl if you want to access videos that don't work in Livestreamer.\n. Thanks!\n. Do you get any error messages in the console? Also, can you link me a VOD where you know this is happening?\n. I just tried to watch that VOD for about an hour (at 4x speed in mpv) but was not able to notice any jumps. \nDo you know if you have any connection issues with Twitch? Twitch VODs are split up into 30 min segments and it's possible that the connection was broken in the middle of one which would cause it to skip to the next one. \nIt's also possible there is an issue with MPC-HC, you could try VLC or mpv and see if it helps.\n. I see, it's probable Twitch closes the connection if we don't read any data for a while. There is an internal buffer that when is filled up we stop reading data, until the player reads from the buffer again. \nIt's possible to increase the size of this buffer (default is 16MB) with --ringbuffer-size, which will allow more data to be downloaded in the background even if you pause. For example --ringbuffer-size 268435456 would set the size to 256MB instead, but this also means it can use up to 256MB of RAM if you pause for a long time.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Make sure you're running MPC-HC 1.7+.\n. Seems to be related to this codec pack \"KCP\" you're using. With the MPC-HC included in that I got the same error as you while vanilla MPC-HC still works.\n. Nice find, since it seems to be Youtube specific it should be in the plugin.\n. The stream you linked returns \"This video is private\" for me, maybe that's why it's happening?\nSince there are no error messages the playlist returned is valid but has no new entries.\n. Something seems very wrong with that stream. It behaves the same in the browser, plays a few segments then stops.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here, is it also happening with other channels?\n. I've pushed some changes to the ustream streaming which I believe should fix most issues, please try the latest git version.\n(Windows builds can be found here: http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html)\n. > Now this is odd... wanted to try it out, now NasaTV seems to be lacking the 720p stream. Is it just me?\nSame here, looks like they lowered the quality of their stream.\n. Thanks for your suggestion, I will add a --no-version-check option in 1.8.\n. Thanks!\n. Please paste the full backtrace.\n. Looks like this is a bug that was fixed in a recent requests update and I've updated the build environment to use latest requests now. A new build will be available on http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html when the next commit is pushed.\n. Thanks!\n. You're using an old version, Twitch has made changes since that version was released.\n. Make sure you don't have any old versions lying around since from before. The log messages you posted indicates that it's almost a year old release.\n. I think the problem may be on Twitch's end, their servers are probably overloaded.\nEdit: I also noticed you are in Singapore but Twitch is making you access servers located in San Francisco, so the speedtest is really not a good indicator of anything here as it just tests against a nearby server.\n. > \"livestreamer http://xxx.xxx.xxx/xxx.m3u8\" can't play ,\"livestreamer hls://xxx.xxx.xxx/xxx.m3u8\" can play.Is this normal?\nYes.\n\nthe m3u8 file contain only 1 stream ,the livestream always ask me to choose a stream.Is it necessary?\n\nYes, this is how Livestreamer is designed. I believe it makes most sense to behave the same for every URL or it may confuse the user.\nAs @athoik mentioned the URL here is a variant playlist (a playlist containing other playlists). But you shouldn't have to use these URLs manually as there is already a plugin for GOMeXP, simply enter the URL \"gomexp.com\" and it will find all the streams for you.\n. There was a problem with XML decoding on Python 2, should be fixed with c86d58b8bb13f5e73f7854a663fc347950e2708c. Keep in mind that the plugin uses the same API as the mobile app though, this means that even if the stream is online 24/7 it will only return streams if there is an event live in the app.\n. --retry-streams will attempt to fetch the streams every X seconds until it has found some.\n--retry-open is for controlling how many times it will try to open a stream once it's been found, this is useful if your connection times out to a stream sometimes and want to retry immediately instead of restarting the program\n. > This will not occur after a \"[cli][info] Stream ended\" will it? I just want to make sure I understand when this occurs.\nNo, this only affects the initial opening of the stream.\n. Hello, I've found a few issues with your plugin:\n- You are importing unquote but it is not used.\n- The urlget function is now deprecated, please use the new API, e.g. \npython\nfrom livestreamer.plugin.api import http\nres = http.get(url)\n- You can remove all the playlist parsing code and use return HLSStream.parse_variant_playlist(self.session, url) instead.\n. Please squash your commits into one (git rebase -i HEAD~2, select fixup on the second commit, then git push --force)\n. Thanks!\n. > not trying to open this sorry but tried with your latest version and get no such plugin error\nIt is not available in the release, you must install the latest git version.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here, what version of python-requests do you have?\n. Actually, when using requests < 2.0 I also got the timeout. So try updating your requests.\n. It's possible to point Livestreamer to a stream URL, see Playing built-in streaming protocols directly.\n. That is intended, seeking is not supported.\n. Thanks!\n. This is not something Livestreamer has direct control over, you'll need to look up if your player has a option to do this.\n. Looks good, but a couple of improvements can be made:\n- There is no need for a separate requests session, http is already a session.\n- Use the http.json(res) method instead of json.loads.\n- Move the URLs to constant variables instead.\n- The help message for the new options could be more descriptive.\n- Add the new options to docs/cli.rst.\n. Looks good, thanks for your contribution!\n. Does this happen on every channel? Also, are you using any extra codec packs or just vanilla MPC-HC?\n. For some reason I just assumed you were using a Twitch channel, but are you perhaps trying to use UStream channels? If so, please try the latest git version, there have been many improvements to this troublesome streaming platform since 1.7.5.\n. It looks like these streams are doing some non-standard muxing which is causing players to freak out. ffmpeg based players such as VLC or mpv is able to play the streams though, after printing some errors.\n. Please try the latest git version.\n. I do not want to change the default behaviour of this, but will consider adding a option.\n. The behaviour has not changed and you need to enable this option yourself. But yes, it will print a list of available streams before starting the stream.\n. As I said it is an option, it is not enabled by default. Nothing will change if you do not want this behaviour.\n. Duplicate of #347.\n. Looks good except for a couple of minor issues:\n- Use parse_qsd from livestreamer.utils instead of parse_qs, it returns a flat dict instead of a dict containing lists.\n- Import urlparse from livestreamer.compat instead, it has different package locations on Python 2 and 3.\n- I don't like this hardcoded RTMP URL, is this really how the original player behaves?\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Verify that you are actually running 1.7.5 with livestreamer --version. It's possible you have an older version installed taking precedence.\n. Search you harddrives for any livestreamer.exe's and remove any that doesn't belong to the installation directory created by the installer. It's possible you have installed something that bundles Livestreamer.\n. VLC does not run as root.\n. Does running python /usr/local/bin/livestreamer work?\n. Looks like you don't have permission to read the file, does running chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/livestreamer help?\n. Sorry, I meant sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/livestreamer.\n. That means the command was successful, did it not help?\n. Yes, that's because you're missing /usr/local/bin in your $PATH it seems. Does python /usr/local/bin/livestreamer still give permission denied?\n. That's odd, I'm not very knowledgeable about OS X, but I guess it's possible something went wrong with the install. Since OS X comes with easy_install installed by default this should be the simplet way to install Livestreamer:\nsudo easy_install livestreamer`\nIf that doesn't work, try installing with pip (another package manager for Python):\nsudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade livestreamer\n. I guess you could try installing with pip's user mode instead, it should be impossible to run into permission issues then:\nsudo easy_install pip # install pip\nsudo pip uninstall livestreamer # uninstall the globally installed livestreamer first\npip install --user livestreamer\nSomewhere in the output it should say something like Installing livestreamer script to <path>. Copy that directory path and then then run livestreamer with:\npython <path>/livestreamer\n. Ah, right, you'll need to use /usr/local/bin/pip for the pip commands.\n. There seems to something on your system preventing users to access files in /usr/local/bin properly. I'm not very familiar with OS X, but is it possible you have some special security features enabled?\nThe last idea I have is to simply reinstall Python via homebrew, see this guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/ and then reinstalling Livestreamer.\nIf that doesn't help you I'm afraid I can't help you any further.\n. This might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4495120/combine-user-with-prefix-error-with-setup-py-install\n. Please try the latest git version.\n. The link I mentioned will take you to prebuilt Windows binaries. Though they do not include rtmpdump but unless you've uninstalled the installer version livestreamer will still use that rtmpdump.\n. This means there is a connection issue between you and Twitch's servers. It can be a issue with your ISP, somewhere inbetween or the Twitch servers. There's not really anything you can do about it except trying a different quality or a proxy/VPN.\n. I don't think that's currently possible, according to the API docs it's only possible via Android/iOS/Chrome right now. Livestreamer is written in Python so we'd need a Python API first.\n. Thanks!\n. Does this happen other channels aswell?\n. Does it work in your browser?\n. Do you have something in your network setup that might interfere, such as firewalls or proxies? You can try using --http-ignore-env to make sure no proxy settings are picked up by accident.\nIt might be useful to compare the network traffic between your browser and livestreamer. If you could upload two dumps, one where you attempt to play the stream via livestreamer and another where it is playing in your browser it might be possible to find out any possible differences. \nYou can use Wireshark to capture your network traffic.\n. I think it's starting to sound like you have some issues with your WiFi, the errors you describe (except the looping video, that one is weird) can occur if there is packet loss or very low bandwidth available.\nIf you run livestreamer with debug output enabled (livestreamer --loglevel debug) it might give some more clues.\n. Try sudo pip install --force-reinstall --upgrade livestreamer.\n. This is very strange. Nothing is decrypted until the segment has been fully downloaded so partial segments should not be possible. I've pushed a workaround that in case we get a segment that is not correct size we cut it down to the nearest multiple of 16.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I actually wrote a plugin for these sites a while ago but forgot to commit, enjoy. :-)\n. Duplicate of #373.\n. Thanks for your effort but this is not a proper fix. The user should not have to guess if a stream is video only. I've pushed a proper fix that analyzes the first FLV tags to see if we only have audio or video tags instead.\n. > Getting rid of all other mechanisms and just providing it as a command line flag is nice.\n\nI'm not really sure about the pseudo-interactive nature of livestreamer, having to query a stream just to query it again with a chosen quality set seems very awkward.\n\nYeah, I agree. Adding --best-stream-default was probably a mistake, it should have been something like --default-stream <streams> instead.\n\nI'm not really sure about the pseudo-interactive nature of livestreamer, having to query a stream just to query it again with a chosen quality set seems very awkward.\n\nThis idea of querying the streams and then choosing stream exists mainly because in the early versions we didn't have any way of ranking the streams internally and the user had to make a choice of the available streams instead of relying on best/worst.\nI'm thinking in 2.0 (I don't want to make a major change like this before that) we will just default to starting best and then the user can override it with either adding the stream as last argument or setting it via a config option.\nIn 1.9 though, I will probably deprecate --best-stream-default and replace it with a option to set a list of default streams as suggested.\n. Is this gray screen permanent or does it just show up temporarily? What channel/url are you watching? Have you tried a different player?\n. I think what's happening is that your stream is falling slowly behind and eventually gets to a point where the data is no longer available from Twitch's servers which can cause the glitches you describe. This is usually caused by Twitch's servers being overloaded and all you can do is restart the stream and hope it doesn't happen again.\n. As mentioned in #456, we now have multi-threaded streaming, please try it out. Post any feedback there instead and I'll close this.\n. Please paste your full livestreamerrc.\n. I don't know how they got there but there seems to be 4 invalid characters (and invisible in notepad) on the first line of your livestreamerrc. Try removing the whole first line and see if it helps.\n. How did you install livestreamer?\n. Try reinstalling with pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall requests livestreamer.\n. Hmm, try easy_install --upgrade requests.\n. I don't think this really belongs in Livestreamer as I want to keep the CLI as simple as possible. You can probably do this by telling VLC to act as a streaming server instead.\n. > Nevethless, given the kind of error, I'm betting it's because of the string on this line not having the unicode prefix.\nI'm not so sure about that theory, it would only be the case if there was a error and it also contains unicode characters.\nUnfortunately the full traceback was lost when the error was wrapped in a PluginError. If you could temporarily remove these lines (213-214) from src/livestreamer/plugin/plugin.py:\n``` python\nexcept (IOError, OSError, ValueError) as err:\n    raise PluginError(err)\n```\nYou should get the full traceback so we can figure out exactly where the error occured.\n. Thanks for investigating, it does indeed look like Crunchyroll may send localized error strings.\n. Since I merged #388 you should now get a proper error message instead of that Python error. \nHowever, as @asermax mentioned in https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/364#issuecomment-43391012 it seems Crunchyroll wants to serve you localized subtitles but they don't exist for these series you're having trouble with and you get an error.\n. I think we want to avoid using the u'' prefix since it does not exist on Python 3.2. Instead we should add from __future__ import unicode_literals to the affected files. This will turn the strings into unicode on Python 2 just like they already are on Python 3.\n. Thanks!\n. Is this the same issue as #253?\n. I think you're looking for http://mpc-hc.org/contact-us/.\n. As described here you can pass stream specific parameters in the URL. In this case it would be: livestreamer \"<url> pvswf=<swf url>\".\n. Thanks for your patch, I've merged it. The reason we had multiple checks was to support the old azubu.tv site, but since that now forwards to the beta site it's no longer needed.\n. > Is it the one that is available here? http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html\nYes, that is correct.\n. Hmm, I'm thinking this may be related to the wheel package I added in 1.8.1 but I was not able reproduce this on Python 2.6.8 myself.\nI've removed the wheel package for now though as I also noticed it will not handle dependencies that are only needed on specific Python versions (argparse is needed on 2.6).\n. A couple of things that might be helpful:\n- Put print(path) on line 33 of livestreamer/plugin/api/__init__.py to print the path we try to load support plugins from\n- Check that justintv_common.py was correctly installed into that path.\nThe fact it just happened now seems to indicate that there might be some issue with wheel packages on that specific 2.6 version as the code to load support plugins hasn't been touched for quite while and I just added the wheel package in 1.8.1. I will compile the specific Python version to see if I can reproduce it myself later.\nEdit: Also, what pip version are you using?\n. This is not possible unfortunately. Livestreamer is only able to feed data to the player in one direction, we have no way of knowing if the player wants to seek. Closest you're gonna get is to add \"?t=00h00m\" to the URL to select a starting point in the VOD.\n. There was a bunch of workarounds proposed in #355, none of them helped you either?\n. A couple of minor issues I found and made inline comments for, other than that it look good. :thumbsup:\n. Thanks!\n. Make sure you have python-librtmp installed to get all the streams.\n. This is the result I get: https://gist.github.com/chrippa/dfbaad88ee3004498293\nWhat are you getting?\n. You can enable some debug output like this: https://gist.github.com/chrippa/dd2c5f7c14d243742bb4\n. When you use -o file it will not use the player and just write to the file directly. There is a couple of options to achieve what you want:\n- Use timeout from GNU coreutils to stop execution after some time, e.g. timeout 3h livestreamer -o file url best\n- Use ffmpeg as the player, e.g. livestreamer --player-no-close --player-verbose --player ffmpeg --player-args \"-i {filename} <your ffmpeg options>\" url best\n. Whups, I meant --verbose-player. ;-)\nAbout the vlc attempt, the -i {filename} was actually meant specifically for ffmpeg, it is expanded to -i - since {filename} is replaced with a input filename to the player, stdin in this case which is represented by the dash (-).\nI don't know the command option to make vlc write to a file but this should work:\nlivestreamer --player-no-close --player vlc --player-args \"--option-that-tells-vlc-to-write-to-file output_file1 --stop-time 10 {filename}\" ustream.tv/channel/hakatastation-now best\nHere is a full example for ffmpeg that works for me:\nlivestreamer --player-no-close --player ffmpeg --player-args \"-i {filename} -t 10 output.flv\" ustream.tv/channel/hakatastation-now best\n. It seems like when a live stream ends it won't shut down the connection and we are left hanging until timeout. This might end up causing the player to be unresponsive as it's expecting data but is getting none.\nI don't think there is a proper fix for this as it is expected to be the server who drops the connection, you can however lower the HTTP timeout with --http-timeout to force Livestreamer to end the connection faster when it has not received data for a while.\n. Thanks!\n. It will be included in 1.9.0. Probably released sometime after the FIFA World Cup is over. :-)\n. The command window staying open is actually the indended behaviour (the fact that it's visible and not in the background when starting from somewhere other than the command prompt is a Windows thing and not something we can change) since the livestreamer process will remain as long as the player is still open.\nI believe what is happening is that the player process that livestreamer starts is closed immediately since it has detected an existing MPC-HC session and just forwards the URL to it. This will also cause livestreamer to exit since the process it started no longer exists.\nI assume you also use --player-passthrough? Since that will tell the player to do the transport if it supports the protocol, otherwise it would not work at all since livestreamer has exited.\nI will consider changing the behaviour when using --player-passthrough to simply launch the player process in the background and then exit. The reason it's they way it is now is to keep it consistent across all player modes, but I did not consider Window's forced command prompt window when originally implementing this.\n. The channel mentioned has been closed. From the Twitch page: \"The community has closed this channel due to terms of service violations\".\n. Thanks!\n. Either add the path to mplayer to your PATH environment variable or specify the full path to mplayer.exe, e.g.\n--player \"C:\\mplayer\\mplayer.exe\"\n--player \"'C:\\path with spaces\\mplayer.exe'\"\n. This is beyond the scope of this project, feel free to use the API to make it yourself.\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Make sure you are using the latest Livestreamer and that the channel is broadcasting.\n. What does livestreamer --version say?\n. That's odd, the stream mentioned works fine here. Does it work in your browser?\n. Nothing special, just livestreamer mlg.tv/spacely. \n. Here's a few more things you can do to help me figure this out:\n1. Check that you don't have a sideloaded MLG plugin you've forgotten about.\n2. Install the latest development version and check if that helps.\n3. Put this plugin which has extra debug prints in ~/.config/livestreamer/plugins and paste the output.\n. Thanks!\n. I've pushed a fix so it now handles these types of URLs aswell.\n. Should be all good now, before I was kind of guessing how the URLs could be structured, but now it seems clear it's the last part of the URL that is important and the parts before it are optional and can be zero or more.\n. By error do you mean in VLC or from livestreamer? The warnings in the log looks mostly harmless (might only cause some delays).\nYou might want to pass the option -o filename.flv to livestreamer instead of recording with VLC though.\n. Yes, that is correct, you don't need \"--player-no-close\" though.\n. Yes, example: livestreamer http://www.ustream.tv/creativelive best -o \"E:\\Online Cources\\AAA NEW\\New.flv\"\n. The errors here looks non-fatal (each chunk gets 3 attempts to be downloaded) and it looks like it ends naturally. There is however some odd issues with the ustream streams once in a while and it seems to affect these creativelive streams in particular. \nI'm closing this to keep all ustream issues in #265, I'll post any updates there if I change something that might make the ustream streams more stable.\n. This is not the issue tracker for the livestreamersrv project.\nIf you believe this is a bug in the livestreamer library please run the CLI with debug enabled (--loglevel debug) and paste the output.\n. Thanks!\n. How did you install it? You can't use the prebuilt Windows version as a library, you need to install it with pip or easy_install.\n. I'm not sure why it would get interpreted as a URL, but looking at --\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfbest-stream-default it seems you have some odd characters in your livestreamerrc. It's possible your text editor is hiding them from you for some reason so you might need to use another one to find and remove them.\n. Ah, I see, well argparse is responsible for opening and reading the file and only feeds us lines that we parse into arguments. I guess the solution is to strip non-ascii characters from the option name.\n. Thanks!\n. This is very strange, but it sounds more like it might be a issue with the video player you're using (VLC?). Try changing player and see if it helps.\n. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #358.\n. On what URL is this happening?\n. It looks like these videos only has 480p available via MPEG-DASH streaming, which we do not currently have support for. It's a fairly complex streaming protocol and I can't give you an answer if or when it might be supported unfortunately.\n. Closing this since it seem to be the same issue as #223.\n. You won't be able to play the SWF in livestreamer. You can usually use wireshark to sniff your network traffic to figure out the actual stream used and if it's supported by livestreamer, play it.\nIn this case though, it looks like this player is using it's own streaming protocol which we do not support. So you would have to analyze the traffic to figure out how it works exactly and then write an implementation in a plugin.\n. MPlayer has unfortunately kind of bitrotten by now and instead using the fork mpv is recommended.\nAs for your VLC issue, I'm not a OS X guy, but it's been reported that using the 32-bit version of VLC works when the 64-bit does not. You can also try using --player-http to make use of HTTP as the transport instead of pipes.\n. Does installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package help?\n. This can usually be done via the shell. This is a example using bash:\nlivestreamer -o \"quakecon-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).ts\" twitch.tv/quakecon best\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Are you using any non-ascii characters in your username/password that could possibly trip up the parsing?\n. Thanks!\n. The channel does not seem to exist anymore, from the site: \"The channel could not be found, or has been deleted by its owner.\".\n. I just tried twitch.tv/dota2ti_pod_2 and it works for me.\nSometimes when Twitch is under heavy load it may not return any streams but retrying usually works, is it possible that this is what happened to you?\n. It looks like Quick Time may not accept data via the stdin pipe.\nI've added a player page to collect some compatibility information. Please try out all the transport modes listed there and report back so it can be updated.\n. The --player option is parsed with a shell-like syntax. This is to be able to support stuff like --player \"vlc --my-args\". Unfortunately it's not quite perfect, as escaping spaces with back-slashes does not work and quotes have to be used instead.\nThis should work: --player \"'/Applications/QuickTime Player.app/Contents/MacOS/QuickTime Player'\"\nEdit: Improved the parsing slightly with b01e79639099809af46a8b2b8e988509bad89713.\n. From your error messages it seems like Quick Time will only accept actual files, so it's unlikely it will ever work with Livestreamer unfortunately.\nThe reason you got a different error when using open is because it launches the app in the background and then exits but Livestreamer requires the player process it launches to stick around so it can exit properly when the player is closed.\n. Looks like there might be a firewall blocking or an invalid proxy set.\n. This is interesting, but I noticed a few issues:\n- Not all data is written to output at the end and sometimes segments are missing alltogether. This is easily tested with a non-live HLS video such as this. Make sure it always produces a file with the same checksum when running with and without your changes.\n- Putting the \"hls-download-threads\" option in segmented.py is wrong, as enabling this breaks other stream types that require processing segments in correct order (HDS, UStream). You should instead make it an argument to the class like \"hls-timeout\" does it.\n. After thinking a bit about this I've decided that using the RingBuffer to do this is not the best approach to solve this problem.\nInstead splitting the fetching part from .write() into a .fetch() method and using concurrent.futures is the way to go I think. I've started working on a implementation and hope to push it soon.\nThanks for your effort though.\n. I pushed my version yesterday so it's available if you want to try it out. :)\n. > Tested. Works well with my bw caps for anything <=720p and futures do quite simplify the sorting I had to hack up, but when the segments become bigger, the wait for the threads to finish before giving back data causes \"stream timeouts\" (not segments).\n\nIt's just a nitpick.\nMy implementation gives back data as soon as 3 segments have completed (regardless of the number of threads, I run with 6, 2 per ISP), it fails when the 3 segments aren't the \"first\" 3 segments (which is, I believe, one of the errors you spotted) so the stream doesn't timeout (that often) with higher bandwidth streams, only segments do (and get retried, and things blow up when a \"very old\" segment gets added to the buffer, I missed some logic to discard them when newer segments were already delivered).\n\nIf you're running into timeouts you can try tweaking them with the --hls-segment-timeout and --hls-timeout options. You can also change how many attempts are made to fetch a segment before skipping it with --hls-segment-attempts.\n\nAnother detail, the player I use is mpv and I set it up with a commandline with a cache of 8Mb, it starts playing after filling 90% of the cache, then pauses at 20% cache and doesn't resume until 50%, that setup gives the parallel-download time to catch up when there are segment-retries/timeouts but also causes the startup to wait quite a long time, at least a whole playlist is usually already downloaded before video starts, waiting on all 6 segments (threads) of the first HLS playlist pretty much doubles that wait time.\n\nEven though it may seem like it sometimes, it's actually not waiting for all threads to complete a segment, but it does process each segment in ordered fashion so it must wait for at least the first segment to be completed before any data is written.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Perhaps trying an alternative server (using a stream named <quality>_alt_<server>) will help?\n. I had the stream open for a few minutes and there was no stuttering or errors. What I meant was instead of typing best, type one of the alternative streams listed in the output from livestreamer. Enabling some caching will probably help but otherwise pausing the stream for a few seconds to let it buffer can also work.\n. Thanks!\n. Well, the UStream streaming protocol is similar to HLS (that YouTube uses) in that they are both segmented streaming types. But the main difference is that on UStream information about next available segment arrives less reliably. This can cause inconsistent throughput, especially in the start of the playback.\nI don't know if omxplayer has an option for this, but enabling some caching is likely to help. If that is not possible you can always use one of the streams prefixed mobile_, these are HLS and should work more reliably at the cost of slightly lower quality.\n. There is nothing artifically slowing the download speed in Livestreamer. If it is not enough there is nothing that be done except lowering the quality.\n. I've just added support for multi-threaded streaming which might help a bit. Try using it with --hls-segment-threads <threads>.\nIf you're on Windows you can find a build here.\n. In 1.8.2 beta.twitch.tv was actually broken and was using the regular site no matter what which explains why you see this error just now. The error seems to be caused by poor SSL support in Python 2, since it works fine on Python 3.\n. You'll need to install Python 3 and install Livestreamer from source.\nOther than updating the Windows build to use Python 3 (which I don't have any plans on doing right now as it's alot of work) I don't think this can be solved in Livestreamer.\n. OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/livestreamer-1.8.2-py2.7.egg/livestreamer_cli/constants.py'\nThis means you did not have permission to install livestreamer, use sudo pip install livestreamer.\nPS. When you see a # instead of $ on a command-line example it usually represents root permissions are required.\n. It's probably possible, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.\nFirst of all, the experience would not be perfect, for example, if the host switches channel we would not know and still be on the initial channel set when we start.\nSecond, the whole idea of host mode seems to be to keeping a chat community together while watching another channel but since we don't do chat I don't really see the point when you can just launch the other channel directly and chat in a IRC client.\n. It might be possible but I don't know how. It's not available in the API we use now and I don't see any references to a .mp4 when accessing the page with a iOS user-agent.\nYou can easily convert the file to desired format with ffmpeg though, e.g.\nffmpeg -i input.ts -c copy output.mp4\n. Even though that URL has \".mp4\" in it, it's the same HLS stream that the plugin currently extracts.\n. The streaming protocol HLS is actually created by Apple, so Safari is one of the few desktop browsers that supports it natively without flash.\nThat error seems to be specifically related to converting .ts files so I don't think there is any error in the stream itself.\nAnyway, since there doesn't seem to be any additional streams to add I'll close this issue.\n. In c389337 I improved the status line a fair bit, but the requested feature to display video time is not there, but instead replaced with the elapsed time. This is because to get the actual video time we would  have to decode the video, which is not something we can nor wish to do.\n. What channel is this happening on?\n. Do you have python-librtmp installed? Without it, the ustream plugin can only access mobile streams, which unfortunately appears to be unavailable right now.\n. Not possible for Twitch, but you can do it with Crunchyroll and other plugins that use a stream protocol that your player supports, see --player-passthrough.\nFor example Crunchyroll uses HLS so you use --player-passthrough hls to let the player do the actual streaming. I know at least mpv and VLC supports seeking in HLS streams.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\nPS. You might want to set your text editor to use Unix line endings instead of DOS ones in the future as I believe 99% open source projects use that. ;-)\n. Thanks!\n. Unfortunately there is no solution to this right now. It looks like Afreeca may stop using these HLS streams as they only seem to be working on some channels now.\n. Please clarify, by \"nothing happens\" do mean absolutely nothing happening in the console or just that there is no playback starting?\nThere have been reports of omxplayer having odd issues. But they might have been fixed by now, so make sure you're using the latest version.\n. Thanks!\n. @nixxquality already contributed a plugin for this site a couple of days ago. You can try it out by installing the latest development version.\n. There is no generic way of doing this in livestreamer, but some services (such as Twitch) has specific streams with audio only.\n. Is this token generated with --twitch-oauth-authenticate or from somewhere else?\nEdit: Also, could you please edit this URL as needed and then access it in your browser and paste the output: https://api.twitch.tv/kraken/user?oauth_token=YOURTOKEN\n. Ah, I see. When a OAuth token is created it is limited to certain scopes, e.g. \"user\" or \"chat\". This is to let the user have control over what an app can do with your account. When we check if the token is valid we request the username from Twitch so we can display it, this requires the \"user\" scope. \nThe problem here is that the token generated on that site only has the \"chat\" scope, so we get an error when we attempt to request the username and assume that the token was invalid. \nIt is generally a bad idea to use a token generated for one app on other apps as they might expect certain permissions, as we do here. I'd suggest you use livestreamer --twitch-oauth-authenticate to generate a token specific for Livestreamer. This will make it less confusing if in the future you wish to revoke Livestreamer's access to your account.\n. Thanks!\n. That URL does not make sense, just use \"http://vaughnlive.tv/univision_hd19\".\n. This has to be a false positive. I cross-compiled the exe in Linux with Mingw myself. If you don't want to trust me, feel free to replace it with a self-compiled version.\n. Also, for verification, the installed rtmpdump exe should have md5 hash: 58908ee066a88f989b5193e47bf7a1ad. If the hash in the log you pasted is the md5 of the exe then it looks like it has been modified somehow.\n. Try starting livestreamer in the command prompt instead and paste the output.\n. The log says it's trying only the Twitch channel, so it looks like your script is not working correctly.\n. Please try running livestreamer --loglevel debug hitbox.tv/foos without your script and paste the output.\n. You're missing rtmpdump, which is required to play the RTMP streams used by Hitbox. It is included in the installer but not the zip version. So either use the installer or download rtmpdump yourself.\n. Make sure you have rtmpdump=C:\\path\\to\\rtmpdump.exe in your config file.\n. Livestreamer itself will never contain a GUI, but you can find a list of alternative interfaces on the wiki.\n. Does using --player-http work?\n. The tv4play plugin will only work with the free live streams (such as \"Nyhetsmorgon\") and videos. The channels and videos you tried requires premium and we do not have a option to authenticate users currently.\n. Thanks!\n. Twitch VODs are split up into 30 min chunks and it looks like when a chunk have been muted by Twitch it does not contain a list of keyframe offsets. We use this list of keyframe offsets to be able to seek directly into a chunk. Without this data the only way to seek is by downloading the chunk up until the correct time, which is horribly inefficient.\nSince the Twitch player has now been changed to use this ineffcient seeking I can't imagine this being anything else than some kind of temporary hack to be able to mute videos in the chunks rather than in their player until they launch their new VOD system.\nSince I expect that the new system will likely use HLS instead of 30min FLV chunks and probably be ready soon I don't think there is much point to implement this slow seeking in Livestreamer as well.\n. This is really strange, normally when there is a timeout from a HTTP request it will raise a IOError and we abort the transfer. It must have locked up somewhere in requests or one of the libraries it's using.\nIs this something that happened more than once? Are you using a proxy or VPN?\n. Hmm, just want to double check, you are using 1.9.0 correct? I fixed a similar issue like this in 1.8.0.\n. The problem is that while the main thread wants to exit, the worker thread is stuck somewhere and will block the program from exiting. Unfortunately these things are very hard to reproduce so we can only guess where the problem is. :-/ Most likely suspect is a socket deciding to block forever for some reason.\n. This was a weird issue. Looks like any broadcast created after Twitch announced their new VOD changes contains an extra Script Data tag that causes my serializer to mess something up (I'll have to figure out why later). Simply ignoring it fixes the issue for now, sorry for the inconvenience.\n. Thanks for letting me know, I've added it to the install page.\n. Since we can't use the URL to automatically find the channel ID you will have to find it manually. This can be done by looking through the HTML, if you search for \"ChannelSelector\" you'll find the IDs. In this case the URL to the second channel using it's ID is http://www.ustream.tv/channel/id/18628454.\n. This is how you download a RTMP stream via Livestreamer:\nlivestreamer -o file.flv rtmp://muenchentv.iptv-playoutcenter.de:1935/muenchentv/muenchentv.stream_1 best\nIt's exactly the same as using rtmpdump directly though.\n. Playing HLS URLs is already supported, e.g. livestreamer hlsvariant://http://muenchentv.iptv-playoutcenter.de:1935/muenchentv/muenchentv.stream_1/playlist.m3u8.\n. What does it say when you click \"See details\"?\nYou can change your player by editing your config, though using Pot Player may not be a good idea as it's compatibility with Livestreamer is rather poor.\n. > Is MPC-HC/MPC-BE a good enough player?\nIt's up to you what you consider a good player, but it will probably work better with Livestreamer than Pot Player.\n. This is a known issue (#346) with MPC-HC, try one of the workarounds listed here.\n. You need to install python-librtmp to access the desktop streams.\nIt's included in the Windows builds though, so I'm not sure why it wouldn't work there, but maybe you installed via source?\n. We use the webbrowser module from the standard library to launch the browser, which should use $BROWSER so I'm not sure why this wouldn't work.\nIf there is a error reported to us we will print the URL in the terminal so you can open it manually, does that happen or does it attempt to open the browser and then nothing happens?\nDoes any of these commands work?\npython -c 'import webbrowser; webbrowser.open_new_tab(\"http://google.com\")'\npython -c 'import webbrowser; webbrowser.open(\"http://google.com\")'\n. Wait, so you're not even getting the \"Attempting to open a browser to let you authenticate Livestreamer with Twitch\" message printed? Is the command you're running livestreamer --twitch-oauth-authenticate (no other arguments should be present)?\n. Which page exactly did you copy them from?\n. Thanks!\n. The same happens when using rtmpdump directly. There is probably some additional security you need to figure out to be able to access these streams correctly.\n. Should be fixed with 7ea16f5e0b3e116a798493a8d3e751e383644791.\n. Yes, just add it like any other options.\n. Try restarting the installer a couple of times, not sure why it would give you problems on that step. If that doesn't work you can use the zip archive instead.\n. The zip archive does not contain an installer, just extract the archive and use it as is.\n. Livestreamer is a command-line utility that should be used from the command prompt, please start with reading the tutorial.\n. Those URLs do not look very stable, they probably expired.\n. Thanks!\n. The installer/binary builds of Livestreamer has not changed in any way for over a year, so it sounds like it's a problem with your system or partition specifically.\n. Use --http-cookies.\n. Perhaps you also need to add some of the headers with --http-headers? These types of URLs expire quickly so I can't help you test it.\n. You must install rtmpdump. For example, via hombrew you do brew install rtmpdump.\n. > I\u2019m opening a new issue rather than writing on any of the old; which is preferable ?\n\nSame question goes for my request for a plugin for [http://www.pluzz.fr/] put on\n\u201cRequest for new plugins #328\u201d. Should I rather open a new ?\n\nYes, opening a new issue for each new bug report/feature request is the way to go.\n. Every channel I've tried works fine here, can you name a specific channel you're having issues with and what error you're getting?\n. > error: The specified stream(s) 'low' could not be found. Available streams: 320p (worst), 480p (best)\nAs this error message says, you're trying to use a stream that does not exist.  The commit that closed this issue changed the stream names to use the pixel height instead since that information is available for the HLS streams.\nThough since then, there was another commit that added support for both HLS and RTMP streams and also changed the names back to \"high\" and \"low\" to be consistent between the stream types. So either download the latest build or use the correct stream name.\n. >  I have 1.10.1 installed, on this cmptr, and a reinstalled 1.10.1 on my raspberry pi, but get the same message\nThis was very recently fixed and has not been put into a release yet. Install the latest development version if you want to use it right now.\n. You can't sideload the latest plugin since it depends on changes to the Livestreamer core. When extracting a nightly build into the existing install make sure you first go into the directory inside the zip and copy those files there without the parent directory, e.g. there should not be a \"livestreamer-v1.10.1-16-gd322d0a\" in the Livestreamer directory.\n. Both those streams work fine for me with or without the \"s\". Please copy+paste the actual error you're getting or it's impossible to help.\n\nWhat would be the correct name for the \u201cYesterday\u201d stream ?\nBy \u201cpixel height\u201d do mean like 480p ? But that is the one that won\u2019t last for more than 5 min.\n\nThe pixel height thing is irrelevant now, I changed it back to the \"low\" and \"high\" names.\n. You mentioned earlier you tried to sideload the plugin, so you probably have a filmon plugin in %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins, that will override the version shipped with 1.10.2.\n. About the 5 minute limit, there is nothing we can do about this since that is how the webpage works aswell, it's just a preview unless you pay.\nWe currently do not have a simple way to authenticate though, you might be able to copy your cookies from your browser and use them with --http-cookies but I do not have a pay account so I don't know if it will work.\n. I don't really see the benefit of this, the streams should be the same, only supporting HLS makes the plugin simpler and the less we rely on rtmpdump the better. Why do you feel the need for this?\n. Use a shell script like this.\n. Yes, that's what it does, it will rename any existing files it finds so they are not overwritten.\n. I think you can write something called a \"batch script\", but I've never done any of that myself so I'm afraid I can't help you with that.\n. Thanks!\n. Use a URL from the webpage, e.g. livestreamer http://www.rtve.es/noticias/directo-la-1/.\n. Some of the streams seems to be restricted to Spanish IP's, so if X-Forwarded-For does not work then you probably have to use a proxy to access them.\n. If you want to use the playlist URL directly you have to add hls:// infront of it. Though you shouldn't have to, as the whole point of the plugin system is to let you use normal URLs from websites, e.g. http://www.rtve.es/noticias/directo-la-1.\n. Duplicate of #514.\n. > It would be even better if it worked with youtube playlists and not only single videos, but that's just an extra.\nSorry, but this is not likely to happen. Since Livestreamer is made for live streams, it is designed to play one stream only. I think you're probably better off asking the developers of your favorite music player to add support for youtube instead, since that is what they are designed for.\n. Are you talking about what file format is outputted with the -o option? The output format depends on what stream type is used and cannot be changed. For example, HLS is MPEG-TS, HDS and RTMP is FLV and HTTP can be anything but most commonly MP4 or FLV.\n. > oh ok and what about quality settings?\nPlease read the tutorial.\n\nandf how do we know which type each service uses?\n\nThe stream type is visible in the console output when opening a stream, e.g. \"[cli][info] Opening stream: source (hls)\".\n. The file output mode is very basic so that's not possible currently. livedumper is perhaps what you're looking for, it's a interface to livestreamer focused on downloading the stream rather than watching it.\n. > right now it just saves at best possible \"as is\" correct?\nSorry, but I don't quite understand what you're asking.\n. Yes, that's correct.\n. Thanks!\n. Leton.tv should already be supported, is it not working for you?\n. This is a issue with version 2.4.0 of the requests library and a bug fix release will probably be out soon. In the mean time, install version 2.3.0 instead: pip install requests==2.3.0.\n. requests 2.4.1 is now released.\n. I'm not sure what Adobe Access is, but there doesn't seem to be any protection other than requiring a UK IP to access the streams. So yes, it should work fine.\n. What command are you running and what error are you getting?\n. I'm not very familiar with Plex, so I can't answer if it's possible or how complicated it would be to do. But I guess the question is, why would you want to use Livestreamer instead of any of the existing Plex apps?\n. I don't quite get what you're asking, but you can download ffmpeg here.\n. I see... Yes, just use the --player option. For example: livestreamer --player ffplay url best\n. The correct format is ringbuffer-size=50M, don't forget the =.\n. Stdin on livestreamer should be forwarded to the player. The input might be buffered though, and since you're writing only one character you probably have to call popen.stdin.flush() to make sure it gets written immediately or pass bufsize=0 to subprocess.Popen() to disable the buffering.\n. Perhaps this will help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8925903/how-to-fix-getaddrinfo-failure-for-python-on-windows\n. As the answer there suggests, check if you have any invalid proxies set in your Internet Explorer settings.\n. Hmm, not sure, but maybe you can find the same settings in your control panel if you don't have IE.\n. The crash is caused by a bug in requests 2.4.0, upgrading to 2.4.1 will solve that. However, it looks like you also have a connection issue, possibly some firewall or faulty network hardware.\n. > is it possible to get the player to stay open when stream ends?\n\nim using a .bat file and livestreamer wont restart until player closes even when stream ends.\n\nThis is confusing, first you ask if the player can stay open and then you say that it does and you want it to close?\nEither way, if you use the --player-no-close option the player will not be closed when stream ends and if it's not used then the player will be closed when stream ends.\n. I think I understand what you want to do now, you want to re-use the initial player instead of starting a new one for each stream? That's not possible due to the way the communication between Livestreamer and the player is implemented. \n. We currently do not have a simple way to authenticate with ilive. You might be able to use the --http-cookies option with the cookies from your browser but I have not tested this myself since I don't have a premum account.\n. Sounds like you have a firewall or some problem in your network (bad wifi signal perhaps?).\n. Thanks!\n. Works fine here, make sure you're using the latest version (1.10.2). You can check with livestreamer --version.\n. Totally forgot to merge this, but since you made another fix I'll close this one.\n. This is already possible, see --player-continuous-http.\n. > Basically when a stream ends i want the player to close and eventually with it the livestreamer cmd window, but before that livestreamer should just try to open the stream once again for a user specified time frame (like 10minutes) before shutting itself down, in case the stream comes back in that time.\nI'm not fond of the idea of Livestreamer doing too much magic such as launching and closing the player multiple times depending on certain conditions. If you really want this you can write a script that just retries starting Livestreamer according to your specifications.\n\nAs it is now (even with --player-continuous-http) the player just closes at the end of the stream (mpc-hc is set to \"repeat forever\" in playback options) and so does the livestreamer cmd window...\nSo I'm running some excessive tests again right now with the options, but all that http has done for me so far is like 10 times longer start up times of the stream/player\n\nUnfortunately players that use the Windows codecs to access HTTP (such as MPC-HC) has issues with our HTTP modes since for some reason Windows wants to do multiple requests to our server and we don't know which one is the real one so we end up opening the stream for each request which might be slow or end up not working at all. Using VLC or mpv recommended instead since they behave much more sanely and only does one request.\n. > i can't really understand your mindset, since livestreamer closes media players by default anyway and this would be an optional setting (which i think also got requested at other places before, but was then shut down very fast as well).\nI've considered adding such a option in the past but I have always been hesitant since I believe it's a bad user experience. The main reason is that, while it may not be the case if you're using Windows,  it's very common in the Linux world to have multiple virtual desktops and having Livestreamer potentially start another player after the initial start that could pop up on the wrong desktop is what I consider really poor behaviour from an application.\nTherefore I came up with a solution that keeps the existing player going but starts a new stream,  which is --player-continuous-http. I believe it's the best approach to solve the issue. The only downside is that it has problems with MPC-HC but I'm sure that can be solved somehow. Either by improving our HTTP server or changing something in MPC-HC so it avoids relying on the Windows codec's poor behaviour.\n. I'm really not sure this is something Livestreamer should be doing. Keeping the interactions with the environment to a minimum is important to maintain our cross-platform compatibility. You can probably do this with a simple script that gets the clipboard contents and launches Livestreamer.\n. It looks like php is clearing out the environment variables set by Windows. We need access to the variable 'APPDATA' to find the directory containing the config files. \nYou might be able to work around this by setting the variable manually in php. You can see the correct value by typing \"set\" in the command prompt and look for 'APPDATA'. \n. putenv looks like a likely candidate, but I'm not very familiar with PHP APIs.\n. > can this be put in the bat file as well? it just needs the folder where the config file is right?\nFrom my understanding of the error message you gave me it's PHP that is not letting Livestreamer access the environment variables set by Windows not the .bat file. So no, you need to make PHP start Livestreamer with the environment variable intact. \n\nwhat exactly am i supposed to be in this ?? \n\nYou're the PHP programmer, not me... The documentation I linked you gives you all the information you need. It looks like this should work:\nphp\nputenv(\"APPDATA=C:/User/username/Application data\");\nBut replace the path with the correct one from your environment.\n. It's possible rtmpdump also requires an intact environment and crashes because of it.\nI got no clue what that WScript stuff is, but if it's not something you're required to use then you should probably use PHP's builtin way of launching processes instead: shell_exec. It might keep the environment intact.\n. The commands you got working are the ones that do not actually do any streaming. The streams you've tried requires --swfVfy to be passed to rtmpdump, this option makes rtmpdump hash the SWF and then write the value to a cache. It's likely rtmpdump needs access to environment variables to find a good location to write this cache, but since php (or the WScript thing?) is clearing the environment, it will crash.\nYou need to figure out what environment variables are missing or find a way for PHP to not clear the environment.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I managed to run into this aswell, but I'm 100% sure this not a Livestreamer bug but rather something in mpv or the nvidia driver. Because it happens even when launching with mpv <the URL to the playlist>, and no Livestreamer involved at all.\n. I'm not seeing this here, perhaps it was just a temporary server issue?\n. I don't think there's really a reason to use Livestreamer for something like this.\nSince Twitch uses HLS, which is a segmented streaming technology based on HTTP, you can probably just cache the requests similar to how you do steam downloads.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Also, Livestreamer does not do any muxing or messing with the data at all, it's just a simple transfer from the server so if there is an issue with timestamps it's originating from the server.\n. Huh? There is no stream on the front page, so what would it open?\n. I see, I thought you meant using only the domain name as the URL passed to Livestreamer. df62756ceb7878d53e55ca429ca0db2a4c188969 adds support for the ilive.to domain.\n. You're attempting to play a URL that is a kind of catalog for multiple streams, try using a URL pointing directly to a stream instead, e.g. http://www.viagame.com/channels/viagame-house-cup/439013.\n. See #564. I will look into making the plugin handle channel pages aswell.\n. Documenting the escaping vadmium mentions is probably the way to go.\n--player-args is really intended for use where you must change the order of arguments and using --player (which does not use any formatting args) should generally be enough for most users.\n. It sounds like a issue with VLC indeed, have you tried not using vaapi?\nYou probably want to report this to the VLC project instead.\n. A option like this requires us to collect and expose metadata about the streams. Metadata collection is planned for 2.0 and I will consider adding such a option then.\n. According to this reddit thread it might help to run ipconfig /flushdns.\nIf that doesn't help you might want to check if you have a firewall blocking Livestreamer.\n. Livestreamer has a library API available that you can use to create an android app. But keep in mind that Livestreamer is written in Python so it's not painless to integrate into an Android app, though the Kivy framework might help with that.\nSo while it's possible, providing such an app is far beyond the scope of this project.\n. No update I'm afraid. If you wish things to move faster feel free to submit a patch as a pull request.\n. Are you using --player-continuous-http? That's the only thing I can think of that can possibly cause looping.\n. Do you have \"Auto re-connect\" or \"Continuous stream\" enabled under VLC Settings -> Input / Codecs -> Access modules -> HTTP(S)? Those options might interfere.\n. Could this be the same bug as #253? Try changing audio output to ALSA instead of Pulseaudio.\n. See configuration file.\n. You need to write a plain text file, not a document.\n. You're using a long style dash, use two normal ones instead.\n. You can probably do this by piping into netcat instead, e.g.\nlivestreamer -O url best | netcat -u localhost 5555\n. Do you have an example URL?\n. Looks like this is the same issue as #223. Some qualities are only available via MPEG-DASH which we can't handle currently.\n. Please create a separate issue for each problem and put some more effort into describing the issues (e.g. what URL it occurs on and what error you are getting).\n. Livestreamer can't magically figure out what stream you want to access on sites it doesn't know about, there needs to be a plugin written for the service before it can work.\n. Is this a video or live stream?\n. Hmm, do you have a very large cache set? The only way I can see this happening is if the stream has been fully read from Livestreamer but not played yet. By default Livestreamer will close the player when it has no more data to give to the player. You can try disabling this behaviour with --player-no-close.\n. Hmm, if --player-no-close didn't help then it can't be cache related. What happens if you download the video to a file (-o filename.flv) and then play it?\n. It looks like the file downloads completely but your player is failing play the whole video. What version of VLC are you using?\n. Thanks!\n. I'm afraid you'll have more luck asking Google than here.\n. The wiki is editable by anyone so feel free to add it yourself. :-)\n. Indeed, as mentioned in the issue @VackerSimon referenced, it's not possible until we support MPEG-DASH. We'll use #223 to track the issue.\n. Looks like the mobile streams have moved or been disabled. You can install python-librtmp to gain access to the desktop streams though.\n. It looks like the mobile streams have returned, so UStream is once again usable without python-librtmp installed.\n. Please run with -v --loglevel debug and paste the output.\n. Make sure you have the latest version of omxplayer. It has been reported in the past to have bugs preventing normal playback but they might be fixed.\n. The Livestream.com streams are known to be badly encoded so it's possible omxplayer can't handle them. I suggest you try another player.\n. I'd recommend mpv if it's available for Raspberry Pi, otherwise VLC.\n. I'm not sure what text you're referring to, but if there is a option to change this in VLC you can pass that option using the --player option in Livestreamer.\n. It should not be part of the library core no, but it would be OK in the CLI. But maybe not exactly as described here though. Maybe something like --alias myfavstream twitch.tv/cosmowright which translates to this in the config:\nalias=myfavstream twitch.tv/cosmowright\nalias=myotherfavstream twitch.tv/zfg1\nThe CLI then just needs to check if there is an alias passed and if so use the URL it points to instead.\n. Thanks!\n. Docopt is great for small and simple programs but it's not a good fit for Livestreamer.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Not possible until requests/urllib3 has support. See shazow/urllib3#284 for the current progress.\n. See http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/api_guide.html.\n. Did you name your script or have a file named \"livestreamer.py\" in the same directory? That would cause a conflict.\n. Twitch uses a streaming protocol called HLS, which instead of continuously streaming splits the video into smaller segments, which is why you see spikes like this. You can probably use some software to limit the max speed of Livestreamer, and as long as you don't put the limit below the bitrate of the stream it should be a little less spiky but may increase the chance of buffering.\n. Should be fixed by #722.\n. Please read the tutorial. You need to specify a quality to play.\n. Not able to reproduce this here, both HLS and RTMP are available for me.\n. Thanks!\n. Sounds like the issue is at the source, you can use the Twitch Analyzer to check if that's the case.\n. That's odd, but by using the --player-passthrough option Livestreamer is essentialy out of the picture after it has started the player. So the issue must be somewhere in your player, perhaps hardware decoding is causing issues?\n. Transcodes are not always available on Twitch, it depends on if there is capacity available and if the channel is partnered.\n. Hmm, should probably change this (and --http-cookies, --http-query-params) into repeatable options that take a key and value argument instead. Should make it simpler to use and get rid of this bug aswell.\n. No, it's not really possible with current desgin of Livestreamer. We don't know what type of HLS playlist it is until we have attempted to open the stream, at which point it's too late to return new streams.\n. The plugin was updated a while ago to support streamlive.to URLs, make sure you're using a recent git version of Livestreamer.\n. This is pretty strange, what about other programs that have added themself to your path, do they work?\n. Looks like your connection to Twitch is too slow, causing you to fall behind on downloading segments, eventually reaching a point where the segments are no longer available.\nIn some cases it can be your ISP limiting each individual connection, in which case the --hls-segment-threads option might help, since it will open multiple connections.\n. > btw, is there not a option the set the queue size?change this line might help?\nSince we added parallel downloads it's now possible to fill the queue if all threads are downloading, I've raised the limit to 20 in f4c083b2a836d8cc2cd73a9036c5d89f868c32b9.\n. > When a thread fetch a segment failed,it will wait a long time.Is this a bug?\nBy default a segment won't be skipped until 3 attempts to download it have been made, you can use the --hls-segment-attempts option to change this.\n. No, I think this is normal. It's just that the debug message is a little bit misleading, \"Download of segment XXX complete\" actually means \"Download of segment XXX complete AND has been written to the buffer\".\nWhat is happening here is that we must wait to write each segment to the buffer in the correct order to avoid playing the segments in the wrong order. If the first segment in the queue is downloaded slower than the ones after, it will look like they finish at the same time since we must process them in order.\n\nthe time exceed the timeout option.\n\nThe timeout may not mean exactly what you think, here is a quote from the requests documentation:\n\ntimeout is not a time limit on the entire response download; rather, an exception is raised if the server has not issued a response for timeout seconds (more precisely, if no bytes have been received on the underlying socket for timeout seconds).\n. I don't think making the timeout apply to the whole response download will help and will only introduce more issues. For example, if a segment has reached 90% completion, but the timeout is reached then we would have to start downloading that segment again which would probably only slow things down more.\n\nThe reality is that Afreeca does not have very good bandwidth to countries outside South Korea and I don't think we can overcome this entirely through software.\n. Livestreamer simply does the transport and does not attempt to encode or mux the resulting file. HLS streams are using the MPEG-TS container (.ts) but you can use a tool such as ffmpeg to remux or encode the file into any format you wish.\n. Thanks!\n. That video is using the new VOD backend, which I added support for yesterday. Try the nightly build if you want to try it out.\n. It doesn't work on their site so I didn't bother adding it. However, since they are now using HLS, you can use --player-passthrough hls to forward the stream URL to the player which makes it possible to jump around in the player (if the player is capable of it).\n. I've pushed a v1.11.1 release. For future reference, you can always find links and instructions on how to install the development build on the Livestreamer webpage.\n. I get no output with the -Q option, do you have an example output?\n. Make sure you have 1.11.1 (check with livestreamer --version).\nThe current Windows installer is a bit bad and if you have installed Livestreamer into different locations without uninstalling them first you might be running the older version. Finding any old versions installed and removing them should fix the issue.\n. > I have, it still remains 1.10.2., I think it's the highest available version for OS X. \n1.11.1 is available for OS X. easy_install -U livestreamer should upgrade it for you.\nIf that doesn't help, try running pip uninstall livestreamer first.\n. Make sure you have 1.11.1 (check with livestreamer --version) and that you have not sideloaded a broken plugin.\nThe current Windows installer is a bit bad and if you have installed Livestreamer into different locations without uninstalling them first you might be running the older version. Finding any old versions installed and removing them should fix the issue.\n. You need to upgrade to 1.11.1.\n. You have put invalid options in your config.\n. Please upload you config.\n. Add a # in front of the line that only has \" VLC\". Without the # it is regarded as a option.\n. Are you using 1.11.1?\n. Are you using rtmpdump-ksv?\n. This is intended, currently it works like this:\n- Logging and exit message goes on stdout unless the -O/--stdout option is used in which case it will be on stderr.\n- File output status and questions waiting for user input are always on stderr.\nSince the file output status continously update it doesn't make sense to write it to stdout since it may be piped to a file rather than a terminal.\n. Duplicate of #626.\n. From googling it looks like this error is from apt-get. I think the only .deb repository that currently has 1.11.1 is Debian Sid. Make sure you're using that or install via pip instead.\n. If you have previously installed via pip or from a source tree, yes.\n. Thank you for your contribution. However, this is only working around the real issue.\nLivestreamer will attempt to resolve HTTP redirects if no plugin matches the URL. Since the URL's you mention redirect to a normal URL we should not be attempting to handle them, but the current regex is too greedy and matches URL's it can't handle.\n29ddccc4a518677c4467d5de5a7c16f4bbe9d6bd tweaks the regex so we rely on the redirect resolver instead.\n. Previously it tried to avoid refetching the streams by attempting to restart the existing stream until a error occurred. This however didn't work well with HLS and HDS streams and instead caused it to repeat the end of the stream until a error occurred. This change simply changed it to always refetch the streams to avoid that issue.\n. That's interesting, Livestreamer doesn't use anything but the standard Python library so I'm not sure why it would have a problem. It could be that it doesn't like the standalone binary, so if you install Python and then install Livestreamer from source instead I doubt it would react.\n. Only initial seeking via the t parameter is available on the videos using the old video backend.\nOn videos using the new video backend (has /v/ in the URL), you can use --player-passthrough=hls to let the player do the transport instead, which in turn lets you jump around in the video if the player supports it.\n. Works fine here, perhaps it was just a temporary server overload?\n. I'm not very familiar with Ubuntu, but it seems to be available in Ubuntu Vivid. So either use that or install from source after removing the existing package.\n. Make sure you're using 1.11.1.\n. Looks like a bug in urllib3. Though I think it should only happen when requests (which is bundling urllib3) is installed with pip install requests[security], is this what you did?\n. There shouldn't be any difference for streaming from Livestreamer and from files, at least via command line. You just have to pass the correct arguments to VLC via --player or --player-args (if you need to use special order on arguments).\n. Try --http-ignore-env.\n. Works fine here, make sure you're not using a old version of Livestreamer.\n. Hmm, perhaps you have a firewall or proxy that might interfere?\n. Thanks!\n. Are you guys using proxies? I think it may be same issue as #653.\nIt looks like Crunchyroll may have started to use some anti-proxy measures.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Resolved by bbafd228549103ef194bff9daa8a1d8f3c4e6124.\n. Please try the fix described here:\nhttp://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/WinGRASS_errors#The_startup_fails_with_a_IOerror:.5BErrno_2.5D_No_such_file_or_directory:_.27nul.27\n. It didn't say so in the article, but you probably need to reboot aswell.\n. Works fine here.\n. > So how did your link/ path look ?\nNothing special, just added hls:// infront of the URL you posted. You may want to try another player, it worked fine with mpv for me at least.\n. Thanks!\n. Closing as #698 added support for this.\n. Using Python 3 is preferred since it may have more security fixes and updates (especially in regards to SSL) than Python 2, but there is no differences feature-wise.\n. There are a couple of options:\n- You can use process pipes via --stdout.\n- Get the URL of the stream via --stream-url or --json, though it will only work with streams that VLC can play directly.\n- And if you want to try something crazy you can use the Python C API to let you talk directly to Livestreamer's Python API.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. > Is it in the pipeline to add support for such subtitles?\nTV4 Play uses HDS streams which are output as FLV files. FLV does not have support for subtitles, so it's not possible for us to mux them together.\n\nI'm at it, I was also wondering: is support/plugins for Kanal 9 and Kanal 5 planned?\n\nNo, but feel free to contribute!\n. Please try the nightly/git version, this is probably the same issue that #686 fixed.\n. This is probably the same issue as #232, try using this script to repair your files.\n. Does passing --crunchyroll-purge-credentials help?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. > Cool, did you get to test it on Windows and/or OS X?\nNo, I don't have access to any machines with those OSes currently. But the socket API should work fine on those OSes.\n\nIt seems I broke player-continuous-http, I'll push a new commit fixing it (sorry!).\n\nNo problem, I've already got a fix in my local repo that i'll push in a minute.\n. Try one of the workarounds listed here. If that doesn't help, try another player.\n. Thanks!\n. To display the ads Flash must be used and the whole reason Livestreamer exists in the first place is to avoid having Flash installed at all, so no, it's not possible. If you want to support streamers use the flash player or donate directly.\n. mplayer is pretty outdated and should probably be avoided at this point, try the fork mpv instead.\n. It looks like you're cutting off important parts of the URL.\n. & is used by the shell. You need to quote the URL in \"\" or ''.\n. The stream URL has probably expired or requires cookies/headers to be passed.\n. You will have to research what cookies or headers are needed, it's different for each service. The web developer tools in your browser are useful for this.\n. There has been som changes to the Hitbox plugin since 1.11.1 was released, please try the latest nightly/git version.\n. 1.12.0 is now out and should fix all issues.\n. Thanks for looking into this issue @trUSTssc, it was indeed a problem with AMF3. I've pushed a update that uses python-flashmedia's  decoder instead of the one built into librtmp.\n. The HLS implementation does not support seeking currently, it will have to be added before this can done.\n. Try this in your config:\nplayer=mpv --profile=live\nYou don't need to use --player-args to pass arguments to the player generally.\nThen use this in your script:\nlivestreamer --player-args \"--title='$title' {filename}\" \"$url\"\nThe title needs to be quoted or it will end up as --title=a title with spaces, which mpv will see as --title=a and then the rest ends up being positional arguments.\n. Could this be releated to #253?\n. Not possible until we support MPEG-DASH, we'll use #223 to track the issue.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. You must include {filename} somewhere in the --player-args or mpv will not know what to play. \nIt\u2019s usually enough to just use --player instead though, unless you need to add arguments after the filename.\nFor example,  --player 'mpv --screen=2 --geometry=+50+50'.\n. The only thing I can think of is that perhaps your connection has problems keeping a stable link when it is put under strain over a long period of time. Does running the stream at low or mobile quality help for example?\n. I pushed a potential fix (652dab1be3e80c029a9900164f67619c1c4c5b54) that should avoid the crash at least. But I'm still quite puzzled how you would end up exiting the main loop at all without a stream object.\n. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #706.\n. 1.12.0 is now out and should fix all issues.\n. > This is a brilliant addition,ive just come across that youve added this feature,but because its so new theres no documentation about it,so could someone please tell me how to add a cookie.txt file to this line ?\nNot sure what made you think so, but it has not been implemented yet.\n. > So the cookie itself still has to be added to the line ?\nCorrect.\n. url = \"http://127.0.0.1:88/hls://\" + url + \" headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.104 Safari/537.36', 'Cookie': 'cookie1=value;cookie2=value'}\"\nor \nurl = \"http://127.0.0.1:88/hls://\" + url + \" headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.104 Safari/537.36'} cookies={'cookie1': 'value', 'cookie2': 'value'}\"\n.

Extremely confused!\n\nThe nightly build is just a zip file containing Livestreamer, just extract it and use.\n\nIf I update to the nightly build will I still get the update notification whenever the next stable build is released?\n\nYes.\n. > Is there any way of adding a prebuffer like in p2p so if the server does overload a bit, it wont affect the playback of the generared m3u8..?\nNo, if you want pre-buffering it should be done by the application consuming the stream (there is probably a option in ffmpeg for this). You can also try using multi-threaded streaming.\n. Are you using omxplayer? There has been issues in the past with this player, but upgrading to the latest version usally helps.\n. The tv4play plugin does not support premium streams currently. But even if it did, it would not help as the streams for the TV channels are encrypted using the DRM technology widevine.\n. Duplicate of #739.\n. You can use the --retry-open option to retry opening the stream and the --retry-streams option to retry fetching streams until success.\n. You can use --player-continuous-http to reconnect to streams during playback.\n. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #194.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for your report, this has been fixed by 243edf1b04d2e5a648b70564338a522543e4b2a2 and will be availabe in the next release soon.\n. It sounds like you're trying to use a GUI made for Livestreamer, but this project does not include one.\nI suggest you find the issue tracker for the GUI you're using and report your issue there instead.\n. See Installation and Tutorial.\n. Ah, the changelog is a bit wrong. After 1.11.1 was released the plugin was fixed and the changelog updated, but since then it was broken again (#739) which has not been fixed yet. We'll use #739 to track the latest problem.\n. Works fine here, try uninstalling, double check everything is removed from the install folder and then install again.\n. Implemented by #920.\n. > 403 Client Error: Forbidden\nThis usually means there is some security precautions stopping you from accessing the stream. In this case since it worked for a while it might be using some kind of heartbeat to verify your access continously.\n. The license states that you need to include the license of Livestreamer if you are distributing Livestreamer (either source or binaries). But if you are only calling the executable or using the Python API you don't need to include anything.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. > Can be caused by the new version of VLC ?\nDoes it help if you downgrade VLC?\n. > @chrippa I have VLC 2.0.1 and the VODs still will not work.\nCan you give an example URL?\n. Works fine for me with both VLC 2.1.5 and 2.2.0.\n. > If I uninstall VLC in order to get the most up to date one, will I also need to re-install Livestreamer?\nNo, Livestreamer has no special connection to any player, VLC just happens to be the default.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Sounds like specific issue in your VLC setup. Try changing video output and/or toggle accelerated video output.\n. Are you getting a error? If not, check that the stream actually has that many segments available in its playlist.\n. It was added in 1.8. If you're not getting an error then you're using a version that supports it. Can you link the stream you're trying?\n. Works fine here. --hls-live-edge=10 plays from segment 915.\n. The exact command I used: livestreamer --hls-live-edge=10 hls://http://idealoglx.zapto.org/testhls/playlist.m3u8 best\n. You can use the set_option method to set options in applications using Livestreamer as a library.\n. You should update the application that is using Livestreamer as a library, not the library itself.\n. Thanks!\n. These warnings does not have any effect on the ouput and can be safely ignored.\n. This is a bug in bbfreeze and not something that can be fixed on our end.\n. Thanks!\n. The log doesn't tell me much, but I think this is more likely to be an issue caused by the actual video playback rather than Livestreamer itself.\nPerhaps this is helpful: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14063?locale=en_US\n. Duplicate of #773.\n. Thanks, but this is only a workaround since it drops potentially neccessary query parameters. I've pushed a proper fix (55a097bdfe09afcd2758c6eecb90e3c184c41328).\n. Thanks for your PR. But to be honest I don't think automagic version strings are a good fit for dynamic languages like Python since it will require us to look up the version on each import, causing potential overhead. A better solution might be to bump the version number and add a 'dev' suffix after each release.\n. Thanks!\n. > Anyone familiar with updating of plugin, can drop me some hint on how exactly such problem can be tackled?\nYour best bet is to decompile the SWF and look at the code.\n. > I have nearly a complete feature on what to call but I am just not sure how to actually write it properly in the plugin since the plugin have no documentation so pretty much I am guessing what can be done in there. \nSorry about that, you can look at the existing plugins to get an idea how it works. Bascially you have access to these APIs and the Python standard library.\n\nAnother question is how do I test my modification? \n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to Python will get you started on Python development.\n. I'm not sure what main.py you're talking about, but I forgot to link these Livestreamer specific instructions which might be a bit clearer.\n. When you have the virtualenv activated it will use the code from the directory you ran python setup.py develop from.\n. > Is there a way to integrate the plugin directly in a WPF program seen that there is a binairie for Windows?\nI'm not sure what WPF is, but the Livestreamer API is only usable from Python. The binaries available are simply an embedded version of Python + Livestreamer.\n\nis the license I need to include in this program ? I want to credit Livestreamer's hard work and will do whatever you ask me.\n\nThis is the license.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the plugin will bypass the ads on Twitch, there is an option to put them?\n\nAds are always displayed by some external mechanism. It's up to you if you want to implement such things yourself, but it's not possible via Livestreamer.\n. > Does it say this for any other reason other than the risk of going to a site that might have a fake cert?\nNo, that's the reason.\n. Thanks!\n. You can try using multi-threaded streaming, but if that doesn't help only improving the connection between you and Twitch servers will help.\n. As the link in the error sugests, your Python version can't reliably be used for SSL connections. Either upgrade your Python or install an alternative SSL implementation.\n. Works fine here, what does livestreamer -j url output?\n. That stream is using HLS and should work fine, but the stream you posted in the original post was RTMP, please paste the output from a stream you're having issues with.\n. Hmm, works fine here. What happens if you run the command line outputted by livestreamer -c hitbox.tv/claine-kun?\n. I meant, what happens if you run that rtmpdump command?\n. Looks like your rtmpdump install is broken.\n. How did you install it? I don't know much about OS X but I think installing via homebrew should work.\n. I would like to update the link, but Twitch only supports having one redirect URL set at a time and changing it would break older Livestreamer versions. So it can't be done until the Twitch plugin breaks and forces anyone who wants to use it to upgrade.\n. This seems to be an issue with older setuptools versions, try easy_install --upgrade requests.\n. It looks like the player is refusing the input and exits. You can use --verbose-player to see its output.\n. Using --player-no-close might help.\n. I believe this was fixed in 1.12.1.\n. This seems to happen when DDoS protection is enabled on the site, but we can't get past that since it seems to require executing javascript in a browser.\n. It looks like you have installed Livestreamer into multiple directories and the oldest one is taking precedence. You can type echo %PATH% to see which paths are searched by the command prompt.\n. It may also be a firewall blocking Livestreamer.\n. You have a space in the URL. As described in the docs, any parameters after the URL is passed to the stream object.\nIn this case, HDS streams will pass any unknown parameters directly to the HTTP library requests, which throws an error about the unknown parameter.\n. You'll need at least 1.11.1. You can install it from source.\n. Duplicate of #163.\n. To use on the command line, just put them after livestreamer, e.g.\nlivstreamer --http-ignore-env http://url best\nFor use in the config, use the format described in the docs, e.g. \nhttp-ignore-env\nhls-segment-threads=2\n. Not sure what you mean by \"dropping frames\", do you mean skipping forward as much as possible when lag is detected? It depends on the stream protocol:\n- For RTMP I think rtmpdump already does something like this.\n- For segmented protocols such as HLS/HDS we should probably jump if we get a 404 since that usually means we are very far behind.\n- For regular HTTP streams I'm not sure we can really do anything.\n. This is already possible, see --default-stream.\n. Thanks!\n. You can try --hls-live-edge 99999.\n. Youtube playlist URLs seem to expire after a few hours, not sure if we can do anything about it unfortunately.\n. This is really strange, the crash happens because bad data is encountered when parsing the segment, but I'm not able to reproduce this at all. Do you use a proxy, VPN or anything else that might tinker with your HTTP traffic?\n. Livestreamer closes the player when it has fed all the data to the player by default. You can use --player-no-close to avoid this.\nWhile we're on the subject, it's probably time to change this silly behaviour now. It's been kept as is for a long time as I don't like to alter behaviour between releases of Livestreamer, but things change. \nAt the time Livestreamer was first created mplayer was in a crap state and mplayer2/mpv didn't exist yet, so using VLC was the only reasonable option. But I disliked the GUI hanging around when a stream ended so this behaviour was implemented. Nowdays mpv is the superior player and it handles end of stream much nicer than VLC aswell, so it's probably time for a change.\n. > It closes the player when it's fed all of the data, even if the player isn't done with playback? That seems... like an odd choice.\nAt the time the choice was made it made sense. It's hard to believe but Livestreamer is actually almost 4 years old now, back then it only did livestreams and losing a second or two of playback felt like a reasonably trade off to avoid having dead VLC windows floating around.\n. > What about MPC-HC? I don't want dead MPC-HC windows hanging around, so if this were to change there should be an option to have the same behavior as now.\nYes, of course. Though I'm thinking maybe it's worth a shot to attempt to detect what player is specified and set the default behaviour based on that instead.\n. You have to use it as command line option when starting the stream like livestreamer --twitch-oauth-token token twitch.tv/... best or preferably, put it in your config file.\n. This is a known issue (#346), and it seems to be caused by badly muxed streams from Twitch, but since only MPC-HC is affected I don't consider it a Livestreamer bug.\n. I was able to reproduce this a couple of days ago, but now that I was gonna take a closer look it seems to work fine. Perhaps it was a temporary issue on UStream's end?\n. Thanks!\n. Reading video from capture cards is out of scope for this project. I believe you can use ffmpeg or a video player with support for v4l to accomplish this instead.\n. Thanks!\n. Please try the latest nightly/git version.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Does --crunchyroll-purge-credentials help?\n. I believe this should be fixed with #865. Please try the latest nightly/git version.\n. I've pushed a 1.12.2 release with the fix now.\n. Looks like an issue with requests 2.6.1+. Downgrade to 2.6.0 until a fix is released.\n. It's because they are DVR-like streams - live but with the ability to jump backwards. You can use --hls-live-edge to jump backwards, e.g. --hls-live-edge 99999 would probably start at the beginning.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here (Arch Linux and Debian). Tried urxvt, gnome-terminal and xterm.\n. Please try 1.12.2.\n. Unfortunately the ustream streaming protocol implementation in Livestreamer is not perfect. It has been reverse engineered from network sniffing so it is probably not behaving exactly the same as the flash player. The problem you're experiencing is that the server is telling us about new video segments available for download in a rather erratic pace, you can observe this via --loglevel debug.\nWhy exactly we seem to get segments from the server differently than the flash player is currently unknown, but one theory is that the flash player is reusing the connection to their server, whereas we reconnect everytime we want information about the segments.\n. Not sure if it makes sense for us to handle regular playlist files. Pretty much every player should handle them by themself.\n. Duplicate of #771.\n. Unfortunately the douyutv plugin is currently broken. The API now requires a special token to be generated, but noone has reverse engineered how this is done yet. See #809 for more information.\n. For 100% silent operation you can do livestreamer -Q -O url quality > filename.\n. Works fine here.\n. I tried both VLC and mpv. For VLC I just use default settings with ALSA output (because of #253). For mpv I use default settings with pulseaudio output.\n. I think this may be because the Fedora package of Livestreamer is based on Python 3. Try pip3 install python-librtmp.\n. I don't think playing playlists (with more than one stream in) really fits the Livestreamer CLI usage, you'll have to enter the URL of the stream you want watch instead. Though the streamlive plugin is currently broken (see #739), so that will not work etiher currently.\n. It looks like your Python build have stripped out the multiprocessing module, perhaps to reduce file size to fit on smaller ARM devices. Unfortunately the concurrent module which we use heavily depend on this module.\nYour options here are, either install a Python that contains the multiprocessing module or check if there is a extra package available that adds the module to your existing install.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Does --http-no-ssl-verify help?\n. Fixed by #929.\n. Are you writing to a file system that only supports max 2GB files, such as FAT32 or HFS?\nAre you getting any error?\n. I think I know why this happens. The HTTP streams from livestream.com sends a Content-Length header with the value 2GB, and the server is probably closing the connection after that amount of data has been read. You can try using the HLS streams (use --stream-types hls to filter out the other ones) instead.\n. This looks like a connection issue between your ISP and Twitch.\n. No, supported streaming protocols can be found here.\n. Not sure why you are getting timeout when connecting to the server, but increasing the stream timeout via --stream-timeout might help a bit.\n. I can't answer your question, but if you figure it out, please submit a patch to fix the plugin.\nI'll close this issue in favor of a single issue regarding streamlive, which is #739.\n. Can you confirm that this stream works on the original source or via a player capable of HTTP streams such as VLC? If not, then it is probably broken or not a normal HTTP stream and requires special support to be added.\n. Please upload your config file.\n. Thanks! For future reference, it is usually a good idea to use git rebase -i to clean up history before submitting a pull request.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. The problem is that the server seems to have banned the User-Agent for the library we use to do HTTP connections (requests). A workaround is to use another User-Agent (or even empty).\nVia the CLI:\nlivestreamer --http-header \"User-Agent=\" httpstream://http://iptv.wssiptv.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd/101.ts\nVia applications using the library (e.g. livestreamersrv) use this URL:\nhttpstream://http://iptv.wssiptv.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd.ts headers={'User-Agent': ''}\n. Continuous HTTP is a feature in the commandline interface, it's not possible to use via the library. If you want such functionality you will have to add it to livestreamersrv.\n. --http-ignore-env should tell Python not to use the system proxy. But if you already tried to disable it yourself it may not work.\n. Thanks!\n. Not sure why it would not have been installed automatically, but installing singledispatch via pip should solve the issue.\n. Hmm, perhaps you can try uninstalling both via pip uninstall and then install Livestreamer again. Also check if you have a distribution package for singledispatch installed which might interfere somehow.\n. Hmm, one more thing you can try is easy_install -U requests singledispatch livestreamer.\n. Thanks!\n. It looks like you're editing /usr/loca/bin/livestreamer instead of the config file.\n. livestreamer --player \"vlc --file-caching=6000 --network-caching=6000\".\n. If the token expires you'll probably have to write a plugin for the site in question, so the stream can be opened right after getting the URL.\n. Thanks!\n. Works fine here, make sure the URL you're using is pointing directly to a live event e.g. http://livestream.com/nrl/seaeaglesvtigers and not http://livestream.com/nrl.\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed by #961.\n. Thanks!\n. You can change the parameter used to name the streams by adding name_key=bitrate to the URL, e.g. livestreamer \"hlsvariant://... name_key=bitrate\".\nThough perhaps we should make all streams available even on name collisions.\n. DASH playback is currently not supported. We'll use #223 to track the issue.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. The Livestreamer CLI is designed to handle one stream at a time and it is not something that is easily changed and probably not worth it when you can use a simple wrapper (such as this) to launch multiple instances instead.\n. Once a Debian version is released it usually only receive security updates. The latest version of Livestreamer is available in Debian testing and unstable, or you can install from source.\n. Thanks!\n. Commited with correct authorship as 9732607a78fe08a593186e25401026653257976c.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. The site we host the docs on (readthedocs.org) inserts some javascript which is out our of control, however it does not seem to be behaving the way you describe it for me. I also get a AJAX request to grokthedocs.com, but only once and CPU usage is normal using Firefox 38.\n. Thanks!\n. Write a pugin for the site in question. Here are some examples\n. I don't know anything about i3, but shouldn't there be some wrapper command or something that does this? Seems kind of unreasonable to expect every application out there to implement this.\n. Thanks!\n. livestreamer --stream-types hls --stream-url \"http://ustream.tv/channel/live-iss-stream\" best will return a HLS stream URL if it's available.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. This is not what timeout means in this case. Timeout here means the time to wait without any data being received before aborting. There is currently no functionality for what you're asking, however you can use an external program such as timeout to accomplish this.\n. Not sure I understand your request, but if you want to skip a segment and move to the next one if it is too slow to download you can do it by setting the timeout lower and the maximum attempts to 1.\nHLS example, this will move on to the next segment if it failed to download a segment under 4 seconds:\nlivestreamer --hls-segment-attempts=1 --hls-segment-timeout=4\n. I see, I don't think that's really possible though. Segments must be played in the correct order or the player will run into playback issues, such as audio sync issues, freezing video or just stop completly. \nThe only way to play a segment from the past correctly would be to reinitialize the video decoder, but that is something we can't do from our end since we just feed the player a stream of data.\n. Thanks!\n. Livestreamer does not write the stream buffer to disk, it's kept in memory.\n. The fallback is only used when deciding on what stream to attempt to open, for example if 720p is not available it will open 480p and so on. It does not however move to the next one if there is an error after that.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. To avoid any possible conflict please make sure you removed any possibly old version from your system's package manager before installing the git-verson. I just tried checking out the git-version and jtv-support is definitely still there.\n. I don't use that site myself so probably not, sorry. You're welcome to fork and add it yourself though.\n. Thanks :)\n. It could just be a problem with the Twitch servers, I'm watching a stream right now without any problems. Could you give me the URL to the channel you're trying to play?\n. About the codec problem, does this happen on all stream qualities or only on \"live\"?\nI believe the \"live\" quality on Twitch is the raw stream from the streamer himself and might be using an odd encoder, while others like \"480p\" etc, should be transcoded with a proper encoder by Twitch so they should always work in VLC. If not, then your ffmpeg or VLC might lack support to decode H264.\n. That's very odd. Does it make a difference if you output the stream to a file (livestreamer -o filename.flv) and then play it?\nYou could also try to play it in another player (like mplayer) with the -p parameter.\nThe stream you tried works for me in Arch Linux's VLC.\n. Thanks!\n. Nice!\n. I believe this is because the stream is actually offline (at least it was in my browser when I checked) but livestreamer think it's online because own3dtv still sends info about the streams in the XML API that livestreamer uses.\nShould probably find out if there is another way to check if the stream is online or not since the flash player figures it out somehow.\n. Thanks!\n. Hello, thanks for your contribution. I totally forgot to check if Python handled the \"- as stdout\" when using open(), which was not the case. I've commited a different fix which adds support for using \"-o -\" to output to stdout, as I believe this is more \"the UNIX way\" of doing things.\n. Hmm, well I suppose there is no harm in supporting both. :)\n. You need to install pbs. This should happen automatically when you run \"python setup.py install\", but if not then you can install it with \"pip install pbs\" or through your distributions package system.\n. Duplicate of issue #10.\n. Hmm, are you using python-pbs from AUR? If so, I believe it is out of date, try latest version of pbs instead.\n. Actually, the package maintainer just updated the python-pbs AUR package just now, so try updating to that!\n. Hello, I've just pushed some changes that adds some more subprocess error handling. Could you try running with the added -e option and see if it gives you some more useful errors to paste?\n. Hello, as the message says your rtmpdump is not the correct version. But the version you posted should have support for --jtv argument, so either the package is broken or you have another version installed conflicting somehow. Make sure you only have a recent git-version installed and it should work.\n. From the \"/usr/bin/rtmpdump: symbol lookup error: /usr/bin/rtmpdump: undef...\" message I would guess you are missing/have wrong version of librtmp or some other library, if you run \"rtmpdump --help\" manually, you can see what it's complaining about. I'd recommend just building rtmpdump yourself if you can't find a working package.\n. Since this is a issue with Ubuntu's rtmpdump packaging and not livestreamer I'll close this issue.\n. Please run livestreamer with the -e option and paste the output from the error log file.\n. That's not the log I wanted, the output from the command should be something like:\nerror: Could not open stream - Error while executing subprocess, error output logged to: /tmp/livestreamerXXX.err\nI want the contents of the /tmp/livestreamerXXX.err file.\n. Hmm, could you paste me the output of \"livestreamer -c http://pl.twitch.tv/garenatw 360p\" please?\n. The parameters passed to rtmpdump looks correct. I tried to run them manually with my rtmpdump and it works fine, so it seems to be something wrong with your rtmpdump.\n. Hmm, could you link the url you are trying? I do not get the same problem with any streams I've tried.\n. I actually had never tested livestreamer on Windows before today. However, I just tried it and it seems to work fine for me except that is fails to launch VLC, but that's because I don't have /bin/sh on Windows and can probably be fixed some other way. Using file output worked fine though.\nYour error message does look kind of strange, not the way Python backtraces normally look like... could you explain a bit more in detail how you're running it?\n. I commited a few fixes for a few Windows specific things, also updated README with some install instructions that works for me. I've tried it on Windows 7, Python 2.7 and a git-build of rtmpdump from their website and it now works just as on *nix. Hope it works for you aswell.\n. ac006c29ea56af11b1fdb9ef57882220affc687e should fix this.\n. As it says in the README you need a recent git-version of rtmpdump to play twitch/justintv streams.\n. Hello, thank you for this patch. My original intent with regex thing was to be able to handle complex URLs, but I suppose no such URLs really exists for JustinTV/Twitch anyway, so your patch makes perfect sense.\n. I've noticed sometimes rtmpdump hangs instead of getting video data from Twitch servers, but interrupting and retrying a few times usally works.\nIf that doesn't help please paste the output from livestreamer with -c option.\n. Could you try the steps noted here: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/20#issuecomment-8003822?\nThis seems to be a common problem on Ubuntu.\n. I updated the README with a recommended solution for Ubuntu users. Hopefully this will clear up this issue.\n. I'm afraid I can't reproduce this here. Twitch servers can sometimes be slow/weird and not send video data. But retrying a few times usually works.\nThe commandline you pasted looks good, the reason you got that error when running manually is probably because pbs (the library I use to manage subprocesses) doesn't quote the arguments. You can try adding single quotes (') around the jtv argument if you want to see the full output of rtmpdump. You can also use -e argument to log the rtmpdump output to a temporary file, which on Windows should end up in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\temp.\nIf it turns out it is not a Twitch server problem this bug might be the same as #17, but since I can't reproduce it I can't do much. :-/\n. I did some more tests and it seems the stdin bug mentioned in the README regarding VLC 2.0.1 was also affecting version 2.0.2. Try updating to 2.0.3, it should fix the problem.\n. Hi, this is quite the large amount of changes... a few comments below.\nThe manager:\nI believe these features do not belong inside the livestreamer CLI. I think it would be better if you created your own project called livestreamer-manager or something that simply interfaces with the livestreamer library.  If something is missing in the API that can be fixed.\nRemoval of options:\nThis code may not be thread friendly, but it can be easily fixed instead of removing it. I do not like the idea of passing CLI-related stuff like the args directly to the library.\nThe GOMTV plugin:\nI will consider merging this if you fix a few things:\n- Use the existing coding style. This means for example 4 spaces are used to indent, not tabs.\n- Keep the names SQ, HQ etc instead of bitrate, I think it's more userfriendly. Though might want to lowercase them to be more consistent.\n- Add a option called gomtv-cookie to authenticate using cookies instead of username/password.\n- Rename the username/password options to gomtv-username/gomtv-password. Plugin options should be prefixed with their plugin name.\nRenaming the livestreamerrc:\nI agree using the dot infront of the name is not so hot on Windows, so I will probably rename it for Windows only. But simply documenting the path in the README should be enough, no need to have a bunch of backwards compatiblity stuff for this.\nAlso, on github it is common practice to use a topic branch per feature when creating pull requests. This keeps things nice, clean and easily mergable. You can read more about it here: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests and http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches.\n. My vision for the CLI is that it should be very simple and easy to use. Adding a multiprocess manager that very few people will have use for does not fit that vision in my opinion.\n. 1. Check what happens when you run rtmpdump without any arguments. Any linker errors or segfault?\n2. Run livestreamer with the --errorlog option and paste the output from the file specified here.\n3. Run livestreamer with the --cmdline option and paste the output.\n. Hmm, the command line you posted works fine here.\nIt might be a long shot, but your rtmpdump could be linking with the Ubuntu version of librtmp. You can see if this is the case when you type \"ldd /usr/local/bin/rtmpdump\". If it lists the librtmp in /usr/lib instead of /usr/local/lib then that's probably the issue.\n. Well, you can just remove the librtmp package, but if that causes other programs that may depend on the library to be removed aswell then maybe you could just move the librtmp files in /usr/lib out of the way see if it helps. You might need to recompile rtmpdump though.\n. Thanks. :)\n. The way you are specifying the rtmpdump path is wrong. It should be the path to the rtmpdump binary, not a directory.\n. I updated the --help to make it more clear.\n. As the error message says, you need to install python-requests.\n. Thanks!\n. 8337a3912533dfb7d686a453c53adcda783a50a4 should probably fix this.\n. The file you are trying to run is not a Python script. Run it like a exe and it should work.\nUsing GomTV is as simple as: livestreamer --gomtv-username=usernme --gomtv-password=password gomtv.net best\nUsing the URL to the match instead of gomtv.net is necessary if there is multiple matches going on at the same time.\n. Thanks for finding this. I don't do much testing on Windows and forgot to test Python 3. b69a3f96455f3333bc70b67f828cda784fc4ac99 should fix this.\n. Thanks for the info, b61f12ff89f60a5fa14f6daf3f9891e568456df9 implements this. For some reason I had completely missed that Own3d even had a public API.\n. Apparently there are some API changes between the versions, but a7e350fcef93687d36074c00fe8febebf62373f6 should now implement this. Let me now if there are any issues.\n. Had to switch back to python-pbs for now, since python-sh does not support Python 3.3 and Windows yet.\n. Does this happen on all twitch streams on live quality or just this one? Does it not happen on lower qualities?\nYou could try using a fairly large cache in mplayer, something like 8192 or 4096 usually works for me.\n. Do these streams usually work on your connection when using the flash player? It sounds alot like a bandwidth issue. You could also try using VLC with --file-caching=10000.\n. Hmm, I recently switched to python-sh from python-pbs (the library that handles the rtmpdump process) and that might be related. If you don't mind could you try this with the latest livestreamer release (1.3.2, which uses python-pbs) and see if it happens there aswell?\nAlso, if you could use the --errorlog option and paste the contents of the last logfile created (in /tmp) when this happens it could be useful.\n. I did some testing and it definitely happens faster with a lower cache. The change I did in d729d3e5218225beb4ade029bd5a779d87b57e8e seems to make it stable when using a cache size of at least 2048 (it may depend on stream quality though). But since it still craps out with a lower cache this is not fully resolved.\n. Pretty sure two threads were messing with the buffer at the same time. I added a lock so it should be fixed now.\n. The original goal of Livestreamer was to handle only live streams, but I guess there is no harm in adding VOD support aswell. Adding VOD support to the plugin was quite simple so I went ahead and added that myself in dda30f191de4b4e1de050963c2a3e63f318e83b3. \nAs for continuous playback of sets, there are two ways. The easy way is to use the shell to loop through the sets, like:\n$ for set in $(seq 1 7); do livestreamer \"http://www.gomtv.net/2012gsls5/vod/70988/?set=$set\" best; done\nThe hard way would be to join the FLVs on the fly. This would require you to use a FLV library (I actually wrote a FLV library called flashmedia, which is currently embedded in livestreamer, it should be usable for this) to parse the FLV tags, and then make sure the timestamps and stuff make sense and then output that to the player. This is not very simple, but would be useful in livestreams aswell, incase of disconnects for example.\n. @beridoxy The cookie should be a string with each variable separated with a semicolon. Here is a example of what you can put in your ~/.livestreamerrc so you don't need to type it every time:\ngomtv-cookie=SES_USERNO=xxxxxx; SES_STATE=xxxxxx; SES_MEMBERNICK=xxxxxx; SES_USERNICK=chrippa;\nI do not believe the cookies are bound to a specific IP.\nAs for donations, I wrote this software for my own uses and do not require donations.\n. Hi, thank you for your suggestions.\n1. Nice idea, I'll think about adding this. I also think that launching your favourite streams should be easier, was thinking of maybe creating a simple tray app that checks whether streams are online and allow easily launching them. But maybe there are people who don't use a desktop with a tray and then your idea would be better.\n2. I don't think there is anything I can do about this, livestreamer simply allows the player to read the stream. It is up to the player how fast/much it should read, cache etc.\n. Hi, thank you for your contributions. However, your changes do only affect the CLI and I think this should be part of the library. I added it as a library option and also check that rtmpdump supports --socks in 340e4f4be5988e989d1bab150d2913e2d7916ecf.\n. I'm not sure I understand, I did not merge your commits so there are no -S / --socks switches to remove? I used --rtmpdump-proxy instead.\n. Thanks for your contributions, however there are some problems and I made some inline comments. Other than those, please don't mix tab and space indenting. This project uses 4 spaces per indent as per PEP-8 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\nWhen you've fixed these problems you can get rid of uneeded commits by using\ngit reset --soft <the commit hash of the last commit before your changes>\nThis will essentially undo your commits but keep your changes in your tree. You will need to use --force when pushing to overwrite your previous commits on github later though.\n. The --player argument allows you to specify options aswell as player, for example: --player \"vlc --file-caching=3000\". If you really want to use rtmpgw instead you can use --cmdline to see the options and pass those to rtmpgw.\n. I looked into rtmpdump's --buffer but it is not what it seems. The buffer time in rtmpdump is used to trick the RTMP servers into sending data faster by passing a very large buffer time and only works on files, not live streams, more info in the source.\nI will think about adding a buffer layer to livestreamer itself, but for now I made the default player command use a decent sized cache and added some notes to the README.\n. As a side effect of using a ring buffer for threaded streaming on some stream types, there is now a --ringbuffer-size option which can be used to tweak the size of a internal buffer between the stream and player. \nThis only works on RTMP (when using python-sh, *nix only) and HLS streams for now though.\n. Using --player-http added in 1ff89b8c81ddca6231eec85d46d5b0f309391585 will now make VLC use it's network caching settings rather than file.\n. It's probably related to this: http://www.gomtv.net/forum/view.gom?topicid=227468&cid=0&kind=8\n. Yes there is a problem with memory usage right now, this is why I've hold off on releasing a new version for a while. This is caused by a bug in python-sh, but has been fixed in it's dev branch, so it will probably soon be released. You can use the pip version of livestreamer for now if you want to avoid this memory problem.\n. Thanks for the info, I added a plugin in 3b6f5073fab2965a2e1945ad6eafd2f04aa771e9.\n. Hmm, I did some quick investigation and it seems the _alt streams work, but not the normal ones. I also checked how the flash player behaves and it seems to try the normal one first but then failed and went to a alt one instead. So try one of the _alt streams and see if it helps.\n. Own3d usually has multiple CDN's for their streams, livestreamer allows you to try any other CDN's available via the _alt suffix. For example \"hd_alt\".\n. I made livestreamer attempt to use the _alt streams automatically if the main one fails. So now it behaves exactly like the flash player.\n. First of all, cool that you're making a GUI!\nI believe what is happening is that the RTMP server is dropping the connection to you, this is because the server wants to maintain a fairly close sync and it probably drops connections that have fallen too far behind. This would explain why it is also happening when you pause the stream.\n. Livestreamer only acts as a middle man between RTMPDump and the player, so I have no way of affecting this behaviour. You might have more luck if you ask the people behind RTMPDump.\n. You are trying to pass a playlist to a method that expects a variant playlist (a playlist which links to varying quality playlists).\nstream = HLSStream(self.session, playlisturl)\nIs the way you want to use it.\n. Should be fixed with 4f72bfc990302ed00b44eb64e6f073e6b1d29781.\nI have not documented the plugin stuff so you couldn't know this but please don't name the stream \"best\", it's reserved and added automatically. When the quality does not have a name most plugins use \"live\" instead.\n. Hmm, this is strange, livestreamer only tries to open segments that are available in the playlist, so this means that the server lists a file that may not be available yet. :-/ cb4cfc88633664f31f8c0c74f2fe84e0775bc633 handles this nicer though.\n. Thank you for your contributions, I've merged the plugin. \nI've also refactored the HLS streaming to use threads, it should be much improved and more solid now. The original code was written kinda hacky because I wanted it to stay single threaded. But after thinking about it, a multi-threaded approach is the best way to make it work satisfactory and the code turned out alot cleaner too.\n. Hello, sorry for late reply and thank you for your contributions. Please don't put multiple features into one pull request, it makes it harder to review and writing some explation why you want these changes would be nice aswell.\nIf I understand correctly, these commits contain:\n1. Print internal arguments with --cmdline\n2. Print streams differently\n3. Select stream type explicitly\n4. Add a \"worst\" stream\nHere are my thoughs:\n1. --cmdline is a legacy argument that was kept for backwards compability from a long time ago when livestreamer only supported RTMP. What is your reasoning for extending the functionality to other stream types aswell? If you want to access the parameters it would probably be easier to use the API instead of parsing this output.\n2. In my opinion this makes it less obvious that \"best\" and \"worst\" is available for use without reading the --help.\n3. I like the idea but not the implementation, I've added a way to prioritize stream types with 6a8f2341ceea1bdf95eceaf77413c7e248928db6 instead. This avoids breaking existing plugins.\n4. I added this myself with e874b62541d46e73fe8f06c9e3d0f1598ac20692.\n. > To use the data in another language, in my case bash, without a helper python program that retrieve the information from the livestreamer library.\nFair enough. I added string representation to the Stream objects in 5b268a9cf1a157bbd2fecd3e61c110f046680ab1, would adding a --repr that prints the output of repr(stream) be acceptable? (https://gist.github.com/4413714) For example: \n<HLSStream('http://video72-1.justin.tv:1935/app/jtv_rhJMl7mYJmfRu_JL/playlist.m3u8?ushersessionid=14454&wowzasessionid=440821925')>\nI think this is cleaner than trying to fit this into --cmdline since we are not printing command lines anyway.\n\nI argue that this doesn't outweigh the benefit of the information provided (which stream is regarded by livestreamer as best and worst) because the information about the existence of the best and worst keywords is easily available and it shouldn't be an unreasonable concern to indicate their existence through text formatting (as in this case) or unsolicited information (explicit information (the help information for --stream) about their existence in the output that include the list of available streams).\n\nGood points, I think I agree with you after all. The addition of the worst stream made the stream list look a bit more cluttered aswell. So if you could provide me with a clean commit of your previous version (6a357fc4a25f17f0f0b965c472eefff183d3128a) with the following changes, I will merge it.\n- Print only best when both best and worst are the same stream (this is the case if there is only 1 stream available).\n- Use double-quotes (\") instead of single to be consistent with the rest of this project.\n\nI argue that it's better that you influence the commit I've made (ask me to make changes to it) with the goal of committing it (in the exact form you want it to be) rather than create a similar commit as another author. If you don't mind I ask for an authorship review for this commit to determine if I'm the author (and in that case register me as author through commit rewrite or a new commit).\n\nSorry about that, since 6a8f2341ceea1bdf95eceaf77413c7e248928db6 did changes that would require you to more or less rewrite the commit I figured it would be better if I just went ahead and did it myself instead of asking you to rewrite it.\n. No, I did not take any consideration on how easy it would be to parse it but placed higher priority on simpler code inside livestreamer. The CLI was never meant to be used as parsable input in the first place, this is why there is an API available.\nPerhaps you could tell me more about how you plan to use this raw stream information? It would help me understand exactly what you are looking to get out of livestreamer.\n. > As rtmpdump arguments (together with arguments that might not be useful in livestreamer such as throttle and packet size).\nOkay, but if you simply want to add additional arguments to rtmpdump, you could create a rtmpdump wrapper script like\n```\n!/bin/sh\nrtmpdump --yourarguments \"$@\"\n```\nand then pass --rtmpdump \"/path/to/wrapper\" to livestreamer. But maybe I'm missing something?\n. > And remove.\nI still think a wrapper script for rtmpdump is the way to go in this scenario though. The arguments are passed to the script to do whatever you want with.\nAnyway, I'm not opposed to the idea of outputting the internal arguments for external scripting, I just don't want it to be in --cmdline since what we are outputting is not a command line. \nUsing Python's own way of serializing a object would be the simplest approach code wise. But since that is fairly complex to parse, we need another format that is simple to parse but also keeps objects intact. Your proposed format may work now, but what if a stream type is added that needs a dict or list? I would prefer to find a format that is future-proof so we don't need to go back and change it later.\nI'm currently leaning towards JSON since it's widely supported and maps Python objects pretty closely but may not be optimal in your bash-scripting case.\n. Okay, I decided to go with JSON. I also figured it would be a good idea to JSONify the other responses aswell, such as the list of streams and error responses.\nInitial implementation is on the wip-json branch. Any thoughts before I push this to master?\n. I don't really understand the use for this, if you want to pass arguments manually to rtmpdump why not use it directly? The purpose of livestreamer is to take away the pain of finding the arguments yourself.\nIf you simply want a wrapper around rtmpdump for use in a script, you are free to just copy the source (but give credit if you publish something).\n. OK, so if I understand you correctly you want to write a script that gets rtmp parameters from somewhere and pass them to rtmpdump using livestreamer? But why wouldn't you just make the script (the one that fetches rtmp parameters) into a livestreamer plugin instead?\nThe way I see it,\nuser input -> script -> livestreamer -> rtmp-raw plugin -> rtmpdump\nmakes less sense than,\nuser input -> livestreamer -> plugin -> rtmpdump\nor am I misunderstanding?\n. OK, I understand your needs now. I think this could be useful if it includes support for the other streaming protocols aswell. Should probably skip HTTPStream though to avoid conflicts.\nThe way it should be implemented is probably to take a url like \"protocol://url key=value\", and convert it to ProtocolClass(self.session, url, {key=\"value\"}).\n. Sorry, I did some changes to the timeout code and accidenly broke that. Should be fixed with 02fabcb18e7594ba734038df3d4b7c830aa67248.\n. Thank you for your contributions, however I feel this plugin is too specific. I decided to add a more generic version in 82e5ebe2e738ee2c2909152e9908f3e0c0861460 instead.\n. Thanks for finding this, I went with \\S+ instead though in 7f59ae714a4258667e87985fe47bb55f4326c682.\n. Thank you for your contributions, but I think you might aswell rename that function to absolute_url (because that's what it converts to afterall) and move it to utils.py instead. Also, please use lowercase variable names.\n. Yes, that's almost correct. It should be .compat (the dot makes it a relative import), there is still a baseUrl in the function and you wrote wrong name in the last bit. But you probably noticed this yourself. ;)\nJust add the function last and also add it to the \"all\" list.\n. To have a cleaner commit history it would be nice if you could squash this into one commit instead\n. Thanks, for future reference you don't need to recreate pull requests when you change something. Pull requests updates automatically when you change your tree. If you want to learn how to manipulate your commit history you should read a bit about the git commands such as reset and rebase.\n. I added redirect support to RTMPStream in 1431f68af09754fb9ddcdf954a586e1f6f0ec5ab, simply pass redirect=True to it and it will try to find the new URL.\nAs for your plugin:\n- the try/except block in _get_streams makes no sense since RTMPStream does not raise any IOError.\n- you should fetch the webpage and extract the RTMP URL from there instead since it may change\n. Yes, that's good, should probably raise NoStreamsError(self.url) instead of the PluginError though.\n. One more thing, you can probably remove self.PageURL and use self.url instead.\n. In this scenario what you want to do is remove the last commit but keep the local changes, to do this you use \ngit reset --soft <commit hash of the last commit before your changes>\nNow you can make your changes and commit again, but if you have pushed the commit you now remove to github you need to add --force when using git push.\n. Thanks, btw I noticed that your commits are using @gmai.com as email which probably a typo. ;-)\n. Initial Adobe HDS support has been added, however this is not a 100% implementation, so there may be streams out there that use special features of the protocol that may break this implementation. I have only had a limited of streams to test this on but they are working at least.\n. > But this one makes small freezes on my Enigma2 STB every few seconds (probably every time a new chunk is downloaded, on my computer there is no problem)\nAFAIK no video player can play the raw fragments, so I need to convert the stream to FLV first. Unfortunately my FLV library is not very optimized yet, so the CPU usage is a bit higher than I like it to be right now.\nAnother thing to keep in mind in low memory situations is that by default the buffer for fragments is fairly large (10 * , this is around 25MB for a 720p stream). This is because some streams will remove older fragments and that makes it really important to not fall behind or we will be skipping fragments. That's the maximum size of the buffer though, so if your connection is good you may never end up using more than 2-3MB of the buffer. You can experiment with the hds-fragment-buffer option if it becomes an issue though.\n. > Finally something is really wrong with that stream hds://http://enikosflashhd-f.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@36174/manifest.f4m. All available memory and swap is consumed after a while.\nHmm, it seems that stream is no longer live so I can't test it unfortunately. What is the source of this URL so I can test it later?\n. > The error with the above stream is happening although it is offline.\nStrange, I'm only getting 404's while trying to access the fragments, same with KSV's PHP script. Even though the manifest is available I don't think this stream is meant to be played in VOD mode.\nIs the livestreamer output you posted complete? It looks like it doesn't even try to access the fragments for you.\n. Ah, I didn't know about xrange. Also, the reason I wasn't able to reproduce was because I was running it on Python 3 where the range function behaves like xrange. 2668c0b84fa8a2db530a3b41964c761f59c52ede fixes it.\n. > Maybe VLC is able to play raw H264 using parameter --demux h264? \nWe must use a container like FLV or we only get video and no audio.\n. > Sorry for my ignorance, but is there a better (light weight) container than FLV?\nFLV is probably the best choice here, since it's basically a light weight version of the F4V/F4F format that the fragments are in. I don't think it's a problem of format here, it's just my implementation of either the F4F parser or the FLV serializer that is inefficient right now.\n\nDo you believe we can tune add_flv_tag?\n\nI've run the code through cProfile but haven't been able to find the cause of the CPU usage yet. It is not a good idea to do profiling inside livestreamer since timings would be influenced by network I/O.\nHere is a minimal test script you can run to test things: http://91472ed29efc8986.paste.se/raw\nPass filenames of already downloaded fragments as arguments. It uses python-flashmedia directly instead of the embedded version in livestreamer, available here: https://github.com/chrippa/python-flashmedia.\n. > In both cases serialize and deserialize are the most consuming operations.\nYes, I saw that too, but these functions simply call alot of read_xx or write_xx functions and I don't know what I can do to make those functions any more efficient. :-/\n. Nice find, feel free to create pull requests with any optimizations you come up with.\n. Just wanted to give an update on this. I'm working on integrating some of the optimizations you found and while doing so I ended up bascially scrapping the whole PacketIO class and splitting everything up into smaller parts instead. While doing so I also decided to write proper unit tests for each component but writing unit tests is boring so it's going a bit slow. :P\n. I've just pushed some changes that will hopefully reduce the CPU requirements. There still a bit of a burst when a fragment is converted, but I don't think that is avoidable. On my crappy netbook it jumps to about 15-20% CPU usage when this happens, but only for a second and have no impact on playback, so I consider this acceptable.\nOther than that, I consider the actual HDS implementaton pretty solid right now, at least for the streams used by the existing plugins, so I'll close this issue.\n. This looks good, except that RefererHeaders could be renamed to just headers since it's a variable not a constant and playpath can be removed since it's not used.\n. I didn't look into how Livestation works, but if you want to make a plugin that forwards a URL to another plugin you can do something like this:\nplugin = self.session.resolve_url(urlfound)\nstreams = plugin._get_streams()\n. A few suggestions:\n- It would be nice if you split up the handling of RTMP and HLS streams into two methods and then check  RTMPStream.is_usable() before calling the RTMP method. (See _get_streams in plugins/justintv.py for a example).\n- Since HLS names does not seem to overlap with the RTMP names you can drop the _hls suffix.\n- HLSStream.parse_variant_playlist raises IOError not PluginError.\n- Since RTMP streams are optional you don't need to raise a fatal error when channel id is not found, just log it. Same when looking for the HLS playlist.\n- You can use res.json instead of decoding manually.\n- In the case of only one RTMP stream found it could be renamed to \"live\" instead.\n. Yes, except a few small things:\n- You could check if \"stream_name\" is in jdata just in case\n- There is a typo \"No HSL playlist found in url\"\n- You should probably change the \"url\" in the messages to be \"URL\" since it's an acronym and I believe \"on URL\" is more correct English than \"in URL\", at least it sounds better.\n- You can do streams.update(hlsstreams) instead of looping over it.\n- There is no need to raise NoStreamsError at the end, it's acceptable for plugins to return a empty dict\n- Maybe it's just Github but it looks like a indent error in the json loop.\n. One more thing, \nif jdata[\"token\"]:\nwill error if the key does not exist, use\nif \"token\" in jdata:\n. No it's fine, but since token seems to be optional it should be seperate check.\n. This looks good except that the exception when not finding the RTMP URL should probably be a PluginError with a message instead.\n. Seems like you tree has gotten out of sync somehow, you might want to \"git reset --hard [some commit from a while ago]\" and then \"git rebase upstream/master master\", but only if you don't have any changes or they will be lost.\nI've cherry picked your plugin instead of using github merge this time though.\n. By @ streams do you mean \"bbcworld_en_1@s25664\"? I did notice that there are some problems with RTMP streams, the streams do seem to work except that they are sometimes very slow to start. But I think it's just their servers that are slow or possibly RTMPDump misbehaving.\n. The goal of the livestreamer project is to provide a library and a simple CLI only. If you want to do this it will have to be in a seperate project.\n. Sorry about that, forgot to add a .close() method to the new HLSStream, 3f37fb2ccc7eba8d1af08759a3f09ab425a43344 should fix this.\n. 1aac2c23d6fd1e80e6d4d5ff97382becec231759 should fix that one.\n. There is no need to have multiple livestreamer objects, it will just cause unnecessary disk I/O as it loads plugins everytime. The only things that needs to be finalized are the threads, which for example .close() does, everything else should be automatically garbage collected by Python.\nAs for memory usage, you should know that the current implementation of the RingBuffer (a buffer between the download thread and read thread) is rather poorly implemented and could cause memory problems as it does not have a max size and will continue to be filled even if you pause playback. I'm gonna replace it with a new version soon but I still need to tweak it a bit.\n. Looking at the output you seem to running a old version of livestreamer, please check if it still happens with the latest.\n. Thanks for investigating this, @athoik. It seems this commit made the RTMP URLs containing double slashes behave incorrectly, http://repo.or.cz/w/rtmpdump.git/blobdiff/9d6dc72d7c43554dbe8cdb02f450807230df8c25..f3e3e6b507ac0df89a11764abd15cc9535593735:/librtmp/parseurl.c.\nbe1de3278514be7c7b7b209f3f876f118ef29934 should work around it though.\n. Seems like a problem on own3d's servers, I get a PHP backtrace from their server when I checked the output.\n. Seems to be working fine now. I added some more output to the error message now so it will be easier to tell what's going on in the future.\n. Looks like requests 1.0 changed alot. Use version 0.12.1-0.14.2 until I've updated to the latest API.\n. I left it there on purpose since it's such a small compatibility check and I don't think it's impossible someone will end up running that code with a older sh installed. I will remove it later.\n. Thank your your bug report, but I cannot reproduce this. What version of VLC are you using?\n. I see, I guess I wasn't very careful when adding that argument and just assumed it had been supported in VLC for a while. Looks like --file-caching was added in 2.0.\n. I will add support for this soon, but there is a feature missing that needs to be added first. Twitch VODs are split up into 30 min segments, so a FLV joiner needs to be added to support this.\n. > Any update on this feature ?\nAfraid not. Perhaps I was a bit overly optimistic in my earlier post, what I really meant was that I WANT to add it, but I don't know when, there are other things that needs to be done that are higher priority right now.\nIf anyone else wants to take a stab at it, here are some of my thoughts. The place to start is probably to take the timestamp adjust code from stream/hds.py and create a generic FLV concat class that you can feed a FLV tag and get a timestamp-adjusted tag back. You could then create a Stream class that reads tags from a list of Stream objects (for example a HTTPStream for each VOD segment) and processes them with previously mentioned class to get correct timestamps.\nI don't know for sure if this approach will work though, the H264 timestamps may need to be adjusted aswell which would make this alot harder. Using ffmpeg might be the best option if that's the case. While that would probably limit us to the transports ffmpeg supports, that would be okay in this scenario since it's just HTTP links.\n. > Your approach is to feed vlc with fake, huge file and jumping to a timestamp would trigger livestreamer to feed appropriete timestamp from file list to vlc ? I'm I understanding it correctly ?\nMy approach is simply to basically rewrite the FLV container with correct timestamps. Most of this is already implemented in stream/hds.py, but HDS is designed to be segmented so I don't know for sure if the same approach will work on these FLV files that Twitch provides.\n\nCan we just simplify this for now and do it dirty an unelegant way. The first thing that comes to mind is playlist of all files. That way You are able to curcumvent the issue with timestamps. (Leave it for better times :P).\n\nLivestreamer is designed to output a raw stream of bytes to a output, such as a player or file, this is to be as compatible as possible. If we start feeding URLs to VLC or whatever, we suddenly face alot of corner cases where different players use different parameters and it would also make file output impossible.\nIf you want to write small script yourself that simply launches VLC with the segment URLs, the relevant API URL is http://api.justin.tv/api/broadcast/by_archive/VODID.xml. JSON is also available by changing the extension to .json.\n\nAnd as to a proper issue. Can You elaborate on timestams and h264 thing? I have little to no knoledge of it, but when You talked about ffmpeg, You proposed encoding it ? Am I understanding it correctly ?\n\nThe reason we need to mess with timestamps is because if we don't, the resulting output will not be a valid FLV file. The player would play the first segment normally, but when it encounters a tag with timestamp 0 it would simply stop.  So if we adjust the timestamp to continue from the last segment it should be fine, unless the H264/AAC timestamps also starts at 0, in which case we may have a problem.\nI haven't looked at specifics for ffmpeg, but it might be possible to tell ffmpeg to avoid re-encoding by copying the existing data and simply rewrite the FLV container, much like the approach I was thinking of implementing in Livestreamer. But in a worst case scenario it would have to re-encode it.\n. > http://twitchtv.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/new-functionality-link-to-a-specific-time-in-a-vod/ \nThe format described in this blog post is now implemented as of 219420679ee7485124b5b4a21226066c7b2dad2b.\n. I added support for hours a couple of weeks ago (009360fc20fcf36ee09e9e15eb34725992c30187) and will be available in the next release.\n. Alright, you have a point, but at least you could make the output prettier. The CLI is primarily made for humans not machines so I regard less cluttered output to be of higher priority than easily parsable. Something like this would be acceptable:\nFound streams: live (best, worst)\nAnd another thing I forgot to mention earlier, please avoid putting blocks on the same line as the statement, in most cases it's more readable to have more space.\nSomething like this would be a nice way to implement this: https://gist.github.com/4415832.\n. Okay, I pushed my suggested version instead then (2503380a6589d1168e24826fbfdb6079b677b269).\n. Instead of ignoring HTTP streams you could check stream type and then setup the correct stream.\nSomething like:\n```\nurl = urlparse(match.group(1))\nif url.scheme.startswith(\"rtmp\"):\n    # create RTMPStream\nelif url.scheme.startswith(\"http\"):\n    # create HTTPStream\nelse:\n    raise PluginError((\"Invalid stream type: {0}\").format(url.scheme))\n```\nThe cost of setting redirect when there is in fact no redirect would be a longer startup time. The redirect check will wait for 20 secs before giving up on finding a redirect and then opens the stream as normal. If the need for redirect can be determined in the URL with 100% certainty it should be fine, but otherwise the safe thing would be to set redirect to True all the time. \n. Yeah, looks good now, except maybe a tiny thing. Would be nicer to put the params from the PlayerURL in a dict and pass it to urlget with the params keyword instead.\n. Plugin looks good, but your proposed fix for the redirect problem will fail if there is a playpath in the RTMP URL.\nI've pushed a more solid fix in 589f907115ce336b04bdc708ec722f43dadf7133.\n. I don't think this really fits in Livestreamer and will not be added.\n. Since livestreamer simply uses rtmpdump to stream RTMP streams, there is no good way of knowing if a stream has been disconnected or has simply completed. This feature would fit better in rtmpdump itself than livestreamer.\n. GomTV changed streaming tech so the current plugin is broken. I will push a new version that streams using their new tech (Adobe HDS) soon.\n. I have now pushed support for Adobe HDS and updated the GomTV plugin to find these streams.\nNote however, while VODs work perfectly for me, the live streams may have some hiccups but this appears to be on GomTV's end (see http://www.gomtv.net/forum/view.gom?topicid=229020&cid=0&kind=8). Hopefully this will be resolved in the future.\n. > Are VODs also streamed using Adobe HDS?\nYes, the recent leagues (Blizzard Cup and current GSL season) use HDS while the older leagues still use HTTP.\n. > How can we watch gsl on gomtv when we are using an SNS account ?\nUsing --gomtv-cookie should work. You should be able to find your cookies in your browser and then specify each cookie in the \"key=value;\" format. For example:\nSES_USERNO=xxx; SES_STATE=xxx; SES_MEMBERNICK=xxx; SES_USERNICK=xxx;\n. Looks like they changed their VOD player to use HTTP yet again. 7c4c9ab8b3b7201d67f5ad7c7168206b1dc9773e should fix this.\n. > So no HDS anymore?\nNot for the VODs no, the live stream still uses HDS though.\n. I believe that should be fixed with the fix I pushed yesterday. \n\nDo you think the process of the plugin is understandable from the source only? I guess I should learn to fix these errors by myself to not bother you with this all the time... Seems like they are changing their interfaces all the time... :/\n\nIt's really not a problem, since I'm a GSL follower myself but I watch mostly live and not VODs so it's useful that you report it when it breaks. It's usually trivial fixes but hopefully GomTV will settle with this player.\n. GOMTV seems to have settled on both live and VOD tech for now, so I'll close this issue. Open a new issue if there is any change.\n. Sorry, documentation about this is a bit lacking. The --jtv-cookie option expects a string containing the cookies in the format key1=value; key2=value;, e.g _twitch_session_id=xxxxxx; persistent=xxxxx; should be enough to authenticate you.\n. Could you try opening /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/lib/python3.2/site-packages/livestreamer-1.4.1-py3.2.egg/livestreamer/utils.py in a text editor, go to line 114 and replace\nself.buffer.extend(data)\nwith \nself.buffer += data\nand see if it helps?\nAlso, does this happen with streams named \"_hls\" (e.g 720p_hls) aswell?\n. I believe this is related to https://github.com/amoffat/sh/issues/105. I just pushed 8d240b245ae587b961a0110a0ff2a79cb1f7dad9 which should work around this issue. Please let me know if this helps.\n. The Twitch RTMP servers seems a bit slow right now. Keep trying and it will probably work eventually, atleast it does for me.\n. > so the web player uses different servers because it runs fine\nDoes the flash player start playback in less than 30 sec? The servers should be the same, so maybe the problem is that RTMPDump uses a 30 sec timeout and the flash player has a longer one?\nIf you could try running with --errorlog and then pasting the output from the log file created in %TEMP% it may be useful.\n. Seems like RTMPDump have problems fetching the SWF when the URL contains query params. I also think the reason I was not able to reproduce was because some of the RTMP servers do not verify SWF while other require it. 9997890dc38c34a975c0a438fe0e35ebe785994d should fix this.\n. > it seems to happen on own3d too\nI do not believe this is the same issue as the Twitch one. Please provide some more information, like:\n- Does it happen on all URLs?\n- Does it happen on all stream qualities (including *_alt streams)?\n- Output from running with --cmdline\n- Version of rtmpdump\n. > not on all urls, not on _alt\nHmm, livestreamer is supposed to attempt to play the _alt streams if the main fails (this is how the flash player also behaves), is this not happening?\n. > only with best I guess\nNo, it's supposed to work with any quality, this is the expected output:\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 360p\n[cli][error] Failed to read data from stream\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 360p_alt\n[cli][error] Failed to read data from stream\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 360p_alt2\n[cli][info] Starting player: vlc\nIf it does not behave like this then it's a bug and it would be useful if you could provide me with a URL where this occurs.\n. > As much as I love the SWF change you made, how do I update? I'm currently using the windows executable, downloaded it just today.\nSee the README for instructions on how to install from source. You probably have to uninstall the existing version first though.\n. The error you are seeing is because by default livestreamer tries to start the program vlc, but on OS X it seems that VLC is installed under another name. You must find the location of the VLC program and pass that to livestreamer with the --player option. You can save this option so you don't have to specify it all the time, see the README for more info. \nI would like to update livestreamer to find the correct path by itself on OS X, but I don't have access to a OS X machine right now so I haven't looked into a way to find the path yet.\n. Thanks for the info, I made it use that path by default in 021718787c5a68a33830e18aa41780168a3a9d30.\n. I believe this is the same issue as #83, which was fixed in 9997890dc38c34a975c0a438fe0e35ebe785994d. Please try latest git and see if that helps.\n. AFAIK non of the stream types that livestreamer supports can disable either audio/video and the servers will only send them to us combined. If you want to split/disable any of them you can probably use ffmpeg by piping the output from livestreamer to the ffmpeg process. This example will create a flv containing the video but no audio:\nlivestreamer -O url quality | ffmpeg -i - -vcodec copy -an noaudio.flv\n. > Won't that change cause it to continue trying to write to the pipe rather than breaking out?\nThe next iteration of the loop will check if the subprocess is still alive and break the loop if it's gone. I left it like that on the assumption that when the input pipe is closed the player is probably exiting. But it's probably safer to break when the error happens. I'm not an expert on this signal stuff though, so any input on to handle it differently is appreciated.\n. > I don't think you need to poll, actually. The way I would do it is just try to write to the pipe. If it fails (because of SIGPIPE), break. \nYeah, that's true, 6f2167e061b7e80fc4649eedfea89447a181764c should be a more satisfactory fix.\n\n(Also, not sure why you're passing in both player and out in. Why not just player.stdin.write()?)\n\nThe same function also handles writing to files.\n. > I only see write_stream being called in one place.\nIf you look at the output_stream function where write_stream is being called from you can see that the \"out\" variable can be a file object, a fifo pipe or a subprocess pipe. The CLI code is a bit messy right now though, I plan to split it from the library and refactor it in the future.\n. That environment stuff is not really needed by livestreamer, so I removed it instead of patching it in c8094155816b4583a7e5acabc9583ec148c3d4f0.\n. > c:\\livestreamer-master\\win32>bb-freeze build-bbfreeze.py\nThe build-bbfreeze.py script is using the bbfreeze library to build an exe, so you should run it with Python not the bb-freeze command.\n. I decided to solve this problem by splitting into two branches instead.\nThe \"stable\" branch will only contain bug fixes where I can easily create new minor releases from.\nThe \"master\" branch will contain new features and have it's version number bumped and any bug fixes will be cherry-picked onto the \"stable\" branch and released quickly.\n. > This workflow works but you have to be aware that you can't merge stable into master ever. Are you prepared for that? (I'm personally not a fan of this approach.)\nYep, I'm not really that fond of the this workflow either, but I need to be able to push out new releases faster since plugins tend to break fairly often due to changes out of my control. I don't want releases to be held back because a new feature may have some bugs left.\nI decided to go with this approach instead of the one mentioned in the original post since it's less confusing for users IMO.\n. I believe this is the same issue as #83, which was fixed in 9997890. Please try latest git and see if that helps.\n. print repr(stream.stderr)\nThis is the line that seems to be causing the problem, but it's not in my source so you must have added it yourself? If you want to look at the stderr try printing it after it's been decoded in the _update_redirect method.\n. Actually, I did some more investigation and it looks like pbs tries to decode the data on stdout even though we are only looking at stderr. 2548ca52f5774ade2bfad191e1a66e95574db3e4 should fix this.\n. Looking at the Twitch flash players source code there seems to exist a parameter \"force_geo\" that can be passed when fetching the stream XML. I tried passing a few values such as \"US\" and \"EU\"  but it seems to have no effect. So either it's not meant to have any effect on servers returned or I'm not passing correct values. If someone figures out correct values to pass it can be added to the plugin.\n. > Can you tell me how to try different values?\nhttp://usher.twitch.tv/find/channelname.xml?type=any&force_geo=US\nOnly clue about the value I found in the source was that it's probably a uppercase value:\n_loc_1.set(\"force_geo\", StringTools.trim(_loc_5.toUpperCase()));\nI also found another parameter \"force_node\", but when trying values such as \"video4-1.jfk01\" it will still give me random nodes like \"video5-1.jfk01\", \"video5-2.ams01\" in the returned data. So I believe these parameters are old and not used anymore.\n. Doesn't look like there is any solution to this right now, so closing this issue.\n. Are you using the latest version of livestreamer? There was a HTML change a while ago but I believe it was fixed with 4bafff5fe3df5c2cd8c6bfa0d2c25e8c72383fd6. The stream you mention is offline now, but others work fine for me.\n. Does it work normally in your browser?\nWhat platform are you using?\nIf you run livestreamer with --errorlog it will create a \"livestreamerxxx.err\" file in your temp directory (/tmp on *nix and %TEMP% on Windows) containing the output from rtmpdump, it might give more clues about what's going on. \nA workaround may be to try HLS instead of RTMP by using the \"_hls\" streams if they are available.\n. > could you gimme the syntax for changing the player to gom play for example?\nJust put this something like this in your %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc file:\nplayer=\"C:\\Program Files\\path to GOM player.exe\"\nKeep in mind that the quotes (\") are important when there is spaces involved. \nI have not tested GOM player with Livestreamer however, so I do not know if it works. Some players do not support reading from standard input, which is the default way Livestreamer outputs it's data to the player, another way to feed data to a player is using the --fifo parameter, but this method also needs support in the player to work.\n. > What fixed it for me when compiling rtmpdump was to add \"SHARED=\" to the end of the make command:\n\n\"make SHARED=\"\n\nThanks, I updated the docs with that tip.\n. Looks like https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/79 broke named pipes on 32-bit Python (which the premade build is using). I believe the 9e9005c693bdcf3b9e787353bfb347e43a609155 commit might fix it.\n. I believe part of this was fixed with 9241d252c16d57888d30c6b740ee571be35bf102.\nBut there is also another related issue that I believe I've fixed but I can't test it until next broadcast or find some other HDS stream that's using multiple segments.\n. > It seems like you should be using a set instead of a dict mapping keys to True.\nYep, that makes sense, thanks for the tip.\nI believe d456aebe095026239e40fae2a6bec2ea0fa3e656 should fix any remaining issues with the GomTV live stream. But we'll know for sure on the next broadcast.\n. My changes seems to have worked out pretty well, but I also added support for the new RTMP streams they are using in d13e4bc0cee801be132bdf1446bf06a1d8c8c6c7.\n. Hmm, odd. The only difference is that it won't go through another HTTP redirect.\nBut since this is slightly more efficent I applied your patch anyway. Thanks.\n. Running livestreamer with --errorlog and then looking at the file created in /tmp might give you more clues, this file contains the output from rtmpdump.\nIt would be nice to reconnect automatically but for this to be added it would either need to be supported in rtmpdump or be done in livestreamer by attempting to reopen the stream again and stitch it together on the fly using some kind of FLV joiner.\n. > From what I remember playing around with rtmpdump and JustinTV a year or so ago, JustinTV cuts the stream after a few minutes when over a certain amount of people watch it and you're not a paying JustinTV member. Possibly not for all streams, possibly only for non-US citizen.\nIt is true that Justin.tv used to have this kind of limitation, but it has not been the case for a couple a years now, at the very least since Twitch.tv was created in 2011.\n\nThe JSON data rtmpdump expects to be fed even contains a timeout value, called \"promo\" or something to that effect. IIRC it's not that easily changed, because the data also contains a hash of itself.\n\nThis timeout you are talking about is the time the token is valid and has nothing to do with the amount of time you can playback the stream.\n. Should be fixed with 3e9c9ef2962f73735fd09266c40714ca9c97e2ba.\n. I did some testing and it seems like this happens only on Python 2.6 and Livestreamer 1.4.2. \nBut since that release there was a change to use JSON instead of XML (87addbd013f0a8c62cfc9ef732344bea324e9344) so it should no longer be an issue on Python 2.6 either.\n. > I am really wondering why my version differs from yours, although i use the current one (1.4.2)?\nI'm afraid you've missunderstood me, the changes related to JSON was made after the release of 1.4.2 so you need to check out the git source to use the changes. I hope to release 1.4.3 soon though.\n. I'm not sure why you ran into this issue on 2.7.3 though, I have that release of 2.7 as well and was not able to reproduce it there. I'm using Arch Linux though.\n. This is nice, but you're not actually using the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME?\nYou should probably check if it exists and then fall back on the default ~/.config. Take a look on how I do a similar check for XDG_CACHE_HOME in cache.py.\n. I've added a plugin in 556d550acaceeb494d42416b04cd4e8a8c84a9ec. Please try it out and tell me if there are any bugs.\n. The correct command line to use caching is:\nlivestreamer http://www.twitch.tv/peaches__ 360p --player \"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC --file-caching 5000\"\nNote the complete player command should be within quotes otherwise the parameters will be passed to livestreamer instead of the player.\nYou can also save the parameters in your ~/.livestreamerrc like this (no quotes needed here):\nplayer=/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC --file-caching 5000\nDo you get any clues about why the player misbehaves in the console output? (Use --verbose-player to show player output if you are using livestreamer from git).\n. > same as @memco vlc displays loading bar indefinitely for twitch.tv streams (240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 720p+) but it works for mobile streams (mobile_high, mobile_low) osx 10.8.3 vlc 2.0.6 64\nVery odd that it would refuse to play only some streams, maybe you can get some more clues why VLC refuses to play with this command:\nlivestreamer -p \"vlc -vvv\" --verbose-player url quality\n. As raylu mentioned you really shouldn't need to run livestreamer as root. \n\n-bash: livestreamer: command not found\n\nThis is pretty odd, because by installing using pip it should put a livestreamer executable in a location that's accesible by any user on your system. I'm not a OS X user myself though, maybe someone else has a solution?\n\nMy-iMac:~ username$ sudo livestreamer -p twitch.tv/lethalfrag best\n\nThis is not a correct command line, it should be something like this livestreamer -p pathtoplayer twitch.tv/lethalfrag best. You did not specify a player to the -p argument, thus it thinks you want to start the url as a player.\nAs for the problem with the player not starting, verify that the default player /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC exists in your system and is able to start, and if not try specifying the correct path using -p/--player.\n. > Is it normal that i can run pip only with sudo too? Because i only can run pip with sudo.\nThe pip command should be usable by any user on the system, but installing any package globally using it will most likely require you to use sudo. \nHow did you install pip on your system? After some quick googling the command sudo easy_install pip should be the correct way. \nThis guide might help you: https://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx.html\n. Yes, the livestream plugin only supports HLS streams for now. It is currently not possible to fetch the flash streams since the API to get the necessary parameters is using RTMP.\nThis is not something rtmpdump can help us with since it is only designed to download streams, not let us talk to an API in a programmatic way. There are a few RTMP implementations in Python, but they seem to not be compatible with both Python 2 and 3, which is a requirement for any code in Livestreamer.\n. UStream has an alternative API for fetching streams and it seems like some channels are using this exclusively now. Problem is that this API is RTMP based and AFAIK there is no Python implementation of RTMP that is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, which is a requirement for any Livestreamer code. Therefore it looks unlikely that this bug will be solved any time soon unfortunately.\n. > Maybe add the missing AMF parts into python-flashmedia?\nAMF support is pretty much done, but RTMP is a fairly complex protocol so I don't think I will add it to python-flashmedia anytime soon, if at all.\n\nUsing librtmp from python is it possible to use API? (eg https://gist.github.com/athoik/5484842 ) \n\nUsing librtmp is probably the simplest option indeed. I'd rather write some Python bindings for librtmp than patching pyamf/rtmplite to support Python 3 since I don't know if they are even up to date with latest RTMP protocol, at least librtmp is still developed and fairly complete.\n. Supporting discontinuities is not possible in Livestreamer since we do not control the playback.\nWhat is suppose to happen with this playlist is: \n1. Play preroll segment (info about transcode being started in this case)\n2. Discontinuity happens (this resets the video decoder in preparation for next segment)\n3. Start playback of one of the available sub-playlists, switching between them depending on bandwidth.\nNumber 2 is necessary since the next part is likely to be a different resolution/encoding setting. If we were to simply continue to stream the data we would just end up with a broken stream that the player would refuse to play when it encounters changes.\nClosest we can get is to attempt to parse the playlist as variant first, if this fails return a regular HLSStream that will contain the preroll segment. After this finished playing the user will hopefully retry to access the channel and the variant playlist be available this time.\nIn this case though I'm not sure it's a good idea to brute force access to the HLS playlist. I've encounted playlists that are stuck on the preroll with '#PROGRESSED 0%' forever. I might look into what the android app does to see if there is a another API available for HLS.\n. Created a new issue to track status of this problem, #144.\n. It's already implemented. See #108.\n. own3d.tv does not exist anymore and neither does the plugin... I don't know why you still have that file there, it is not in the repository.\n. Sorry about this, looks like there was a bug in the NSIS script I was using to set the PATH.\nProblem was that if PATH is longer than the maximum string size in NSIS (usually 1024), it would corrupt the PATH. I believe I've fixed it now by using a different NSIS build that supports a larger string size and also applied a patch that would simply not attempt to set the PATH if the string would be too large.\n. Thanks.\n. Looks like Livestream started to require SWF verification, should be fixed with ee9cb4354004251f9ecebd9ee4415cf22a2bdf21.\n. Probably related to #113. No ETA on a fix right now.\n. See #144 for status of this problem.\n. What types of streams does this happen on?\nI have noticed some Twitch streams are using an audio codec (speex) that VLC have problems with while mplayer2 seem to handle it fine.\n. You can already do this with --player. For example:\n--player \"vlc --play-and-exit\"\n. Yes, but you need to specify the complete path to VLC. I might add a separate option to make it simpler to just add arguments though.\n. Hmm, try\n--player \"'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe' --play-and-exit\"\n. Hmm, I really have no idea why the Windows shell seem to have these problems, but another fix is to put the --player option in your %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc instead of specifying it on the command line, such as:\nplayer=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe\" --play-and-exit\n. Because the plugin was made for YouTube Live and not guaranteed to work on all videos. I chose not to include it since I do not want to maintain a half-ass VOD implementation when there already exists a good tool (youtube-dl) to download videos.\nThe plugin does not use get_video_page because that is not what the flash player does. Behaving like the original player should always be the goal of a plugin.\n. Not at the moment, no.\nIn the future I want to create a more proper plugin API for common tasks. This would probably include removing the use of the urlget function and replace it with a requests session instead. This session would then also be used by HLS and thus not forget about any needed cookies.\n. As I mentioned I plan to add a proper plugin API that will fix this problem. I'd rather not add a fix that relies on passing a session around right now, I don't think it's very elegant.\n. I thought about this some more while refactoring the HLS code.\nIn 39008e9df12723e59b77c2da428a062ea7e1d857 I added the possibility to pass keyword arguments to HLSStream and HLSStream.parse_variant_playlist that will be used by urlget when fetching any playlists, segments or keys. This includes all parameters listed here and a session parameter to use a existing requests session.\nIt's not as elegant as I want it to be, but it will do for now I guess.\n. Whups, looks like I forgot to rename that argument to avoid conflicts. Should be fixed with 9043ff03f6ea20151ec998906ccf25585c89bc3a. \nHowever, if you only need to pass headers I suggest you just pass the headers argument instead of a session. It's a bit cleaner and also shows up in --json.\n. Sorry about that, fixed with 7c62c56bb00df548da5c7aa8f43e714daae5e0dd.\n. Yeah, adding a --player-args option sems like a good idea. In the meantime you can however still do this by piping the output from livestreamer. For example:\nlivestreamer --stdout url quality | vlc --your-args -\n. With 1ff89b8c81ddca6231eec85d46d5b0f309391585, a --player-args option is now available. Example usage:\n--player vlc --player-args '--an-option {filename} --another-option'\n. Indeed, those streams you tested use the RTMP protocol which uses port 1935. The mobile streams use HLS which is based on HTTP.\n. Thank you for you contribution, but I feel like this fix is overly complicated. I also think waiting for transcode to start should only be done as a last resort if no other streams are available.\nI've pushed a simpler fix as 6865fa7cfc01820133df3ed77118c35fa77a6c4c. \n. Yeah, I like it. Didn't know literal_eval existed, pretty neat tool. I pushed a more generic version that replaces the original int/float parsing with literal_eval instead. So now you can pass any Python value to the streams that accept parameters.\n. Hmm, when accessing the main domain I think returning all language streams are a bit overwhelming.\nI can't test this, but does accessing euronews.com from a greece IP show the greek website? If so, I think it would make most sense to fetch the euronews.com page and extract the language from there and then return only that language's streams. If that's not the case then only returning english streams on the main domain is probably the best idea.\nOther than that, I think the number used in the json result is the average bitrate, so the correct naming of the streams should be \"350k\", \"750k\" etc, and for the secondary streams they should be named \"350k_alt\", etc. This is because the CLI already has a loop set up to try any streams with the _alt suffix if the primary stream can't be opened.\n. This error happened because Livestreamer failed to locate the path to your VLC exe and thus default to try to open \"vlc\". You will have to specify the path to a player in your livestreamerrc. See http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#configuration-file for more info.\n. Cool, please submit a pull request when you feel satisfied with your changes.\nOne small thing I noticed in your current implementation though, please do not use the \"{}\" when formatting strings, but rather \"{0}\". The \"{}\" syntax was added in Python 2.7 and Livestreamer aims to support Python 2.6.\n. > what system are you targeting that only has python 2.6?\nIt is not because of supporting specific systems (although Debian stable used 2.6 until this May when Wheezy was released), it is supported simply because it is trivial to do so.\n. The UStream plugin is currently missing some functionality, see #144.\n. Hmm, pretty good idea. However I think  what you really want is to be able to tell Livestreamer what qualities you don't want included in the \"best\" ranking, I think a simpler approach would be \n--best-stream-skips=1080p+,1080p\nor do you think there is a use-case for specifying exactly which streams you want?\n\nBecause livestreamer doesn't return anything useful to the underlying operating\nsystem it is difficult to script around it without making a full blown program.\n\nI'm open to suggestions on what would make Livestreamer more scriptable beyond the existing --json output.\n. Alright, I've added a --stream-sorting-excludes in 6f3d0254edb6c36ab785f487e10b23fc88b11041 that controls the internal sorting used by the best/worst synonyms. I guess a whitelist version could be added aswell, but IMO a blacklist is more useful since you're more likely to know which streams you want to avoid rather than what's available (odd stream resolutions, etc).\n\nAs for making livestreamer more scriptable, simply return something other than true when a stream is not found or the requested quality is invalid (or any other errors).\n\nYeah, this makes sense, as of 6cef8334708b09808e7fad613068aa375c6b5587 Livestreamer exits with return code 1 when a error occurs and 0 on normal exit.\n. Try running with --verbose-player to see any error messages.\n. Please don't run livestreamer as root, there is no reason to. Try as a normal user it should work as expected.\n. It looks like the file '/Users/Heinsen/.cache/livestreamer/plugin-cache.json' somehow got the wrong permissions. Try removing it and see if it gets re-created with normal permissions.\n. > Now my only problem is that it dosent play anything i VLC. But that is another prob.\nThis might be related to a strange VLC bug, see: http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/issues.html#vlc-hangs-when-buffering-and-no-playback-starts\n. Hmm, did this happen on Windows using the installer?\nI think the problem is that Requests bundles the certs but they do not get included when creating the Windows build using bbfreeze for some reason.\n. Very strange, I must have run into some bizarre bug in bbfreeze. \nThe problem was that in the Windows build that was included in the installer the requests library was included in the \"library.zip\" rather than as a normal directory, which caused problems loading the certs. But when I rebuilt it just now it worked as normal, very odd.\nI've uploaded a fresh installer that should now work with SSL.\n. Strange, could've sworn that used to work... Oh well, rather than changing the documentation I fixed the problem in the code instead so that a wild semi-colon is not causing problems.\n. As @raylu and @beh68030 mentioned livestreamer is indeed only for playback not sending streams. Re-open this issue again if this was actually a problem with playback.\n. No, livestreamer is designed to deal with one stream at a time.\nIt would however be faily simple to script something around livestreamer. Here is a example of a bash script to check if a stream is available:\n```\noutput=$(livestreamer \"twitch.tv/rogtournament\")\nCheck returned status code, 0 is success, 1 is error\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"live\"\nelse\n    echo \"not live\"\nfi\n```\n. The oldlivestream plugin only supports the HLS (mobile) streams right now. This is the output from the HLS playlist:\n```\nEXTM3U\nno live mobile compatible track\n```\nSo it looks like this channel does not have a HLS stream available.\n. > any idea for livestream.com still working ?\n\nhttp://livestream.com/pickathon\n\nThis URL gives me a 404. Did you perhaps mean http://new.livestream.com/pickathon? It doesn't seem to be live right now, but it should work whenever it goes live again as long as you give livestreamer the correct URL.\n. That URL leads to a recording, only live streams are supported in livestreamer.\n. I am unable to reproduce this. Is it possible that you have some firewall that is blocking access to the justin.tv domain?\n. You can loop livestreamer in your shell, it's a bit ugly but it works for your scenario, for example (bash shell):\n$ while true; do livestreamer \"url\" best; sleep 30; done\nMaking this nicer by not restarting the player is a bit complicated and I don't have an ETA on a solution.\n. Ah, yes for file output it's a bit trickier, livestreamer will always ask you if you want to overwrite existing files (unless --force is specified).\nI wrote this small script for downloading streams a while back, it names files nicely and makes sure nothing is overwritten. It's made for Twitch streams, but you can use it with whatever with minor modifications. https://gist.github.com/chrippa/6151877 \nYou can use it like this:\n$ while true; do ./twitchdl.sh joindotared; sleep 30; done\n. If no stream is found it will simply exit. Running it in crontab is not a good idea though, since on each execution it will start a new download if the stream is up. All the script does is check if a file already exists (named \"streamname-date.flv\") and if so it will append a number to the filename.\nPersonally I run it in a screen using the command line I wrote in my last post, this will attempt to download the stream if available and retry every 30 sec otherwise. \nI forgot to mention that it's hardcoded to the 720p stream though, so you might need to change that if it's not available on the stream you're trying.\n. Here is a slightly modified version that will loop and rename any existing files instead. I haven't tested it but should work.\nhttps://gist.github.com/chrippa/6151877\n. This does not work with file output, but using the --player-continuous-http option added in 1ff89b8c81ddca6231eec85d46d5b0f309391585 now makes the random disconnects/stream offline situations less annoying.\n. Perhaps the --stream-sorting-excludes filtering could be expanded into accepting an expression, e.g\n--stream-sorting-excludes \">480p\" # above 480p\n--stream-sorting-excludes \">=720p\" # 720p and above\n--stream-sorting-excludes \">480p;>1200k;>mobile_medium\" # multiple quality types\nWhat do you think?\n. By default Livestreamer will use process pipes (stdin) to send data to the player. This is pretty standard on UNIX-like operating systems but may not be supported by all players on Windows.\nHowever, Livestreamer also supports a Windows API called \"named pipes\". I don't know if WMP supports it but you can try it by using the the --fifo parameter.\n. It sounds like you tried to run Livestreamer by double-clicking the exe. Livestreamer is a command line tool and must be run from a command prompt.\nIf that wasn't the problem, please paste the output from the crash.\n. Thanks for the info, I added it to the docs at http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/issues.html#player-specific-issues.\n. > back to terrorize people. (how do i label an issue, or does the project staff handle that?)\nFor some reason Github only allow admins to set labels. :-/\n\ncurious as to what live.nicovideo uses, and if livestreamer could easily implement it? though i get the feeling the traffic-based throttling is going to hurt something.\n\nNiconico support cannot easily be added right now. This is because while the streams use RTMP, they require the client to send a special command after connection is established. Since the current RTMPStream in Livestreamer uses rtmpdump it's not possible to support it without using a patched version of rtmpdump. \nI do not wish to add plugins that requires special patches right now, since it will easily get really messy if you need a bunch of patched versions of rtmpdump (the exception is the KSV patch set since it's fairly well known). \nHowever, in the future (probably 2.0) I wish to add a RTMPStream implementation based on python-librtmp, which gives us more control of the RTMP stream. Adding support for Niconico at that point should be trivial.\n. @athoik Are you able to use this with any streams not available on the front page? I believe those still require authentication + a special RTMP command.\n. Duplicate of #70.\n. What version of Livestreamer are you using?\nLooking at the error messages it looks like it may be very old, latest release is 1.5.2.\n. Hmm, that's odd, if you installed it in the default location both times it should have been overwritten by the second install.\nHowever, if you installed in different locations, you may have a older version lurking around aswell. So I suggest you search your computer for the old livestreamer and remove it.\nI wonder if there is a way to make the installer detect previous installs and remove them... will look into it.\n. What version are you using? It should pick source in version 1.5.2.\n. Well, --version does not lie, so the executable you are running is definitely 1.5. Maybe you have a conflict with your package manager?\n. This is supposed to be fixed in 1.5.2, is this not the case?\n. > [plugin.justintv][warning] rtmpdump is not usable, only HLS streams will be available\nPerhaps this message is a bit cryptic, but it means that you do not have rtmpdump installed which is required for the desktop streams.\n. > [cli][error] Could not open stream: Installed rtmpdump does not support --jtv argument \nSee http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/issues.html#installed-rtmpdump-does-not-support-jtv-argument.\n. This doesn't really sound like a Livestreamer issue, have you tried asking the VLC people?\n. I haven't been able to verify this since I rarely find live broadcasts on Azubu.tv lately, but the issue with the live_check.png was probably due to the fact that while the channels may look like they are live, most of them aren't, and are just playing the last broadcast.\nThe missing streams should be fixed with b65e783ae6be64b96640d35e611dd804b0190d32.\n. Please provide more information, such as OS, Livestreamer version and full console output.\n. Hmm, that's strange, it seems to error when trying to open os.devnull (this is a kind of black hole file that just swallows data) which is used to hide player output.\nUntil I can figure out why this is happening, using the --verbose-player option to show player output should work around this issue. \n. Actually, nevermind my previous conclusion, I think I was tired and read the line numbers wrong... \nI think the real problem is as @vadmium mentions, that the path to the player does not exist.\nI am not able to reproduce the exact same error though, since the exception raised is caught on my system. I should probably catch OSError as well though, since that's what WindowsError inherits from.\n. I believe the VLC UI on OS X is a bit different (starts in playlist mode, rather than player mode), so you may need to press play to start playback. \n\nAdditionally, is there any feature to record streams?\n\n-o filename, --output filename\n                      Write stream to file instead of playing it\n. Hmm, it's definetly a bug that the exception is not caught, but the fact that it happened should only be because the stream ended or that you lost connection to the stream.\nPlease try running with --loglevel debug to get some more useful information.\n. Hmm, I still don't know exactly why this happens, but I made a change that should work around the problem for now in 857813826e2df36939b2cd7b1d67d36a406ed7a3.\n. For full access to Ustream's services you need to install python-librtmp. It's still under development so there is no release yet, but most channels should work fine without it.\n. Dropping the updated plugin into %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins will override the built-in one.\n. > I can't seem to find the livestreamer folder in appdata? \nIf it's not there you need to create it yourself.\n. Hmm, did you happen to rename the plugin to .pyc? It should be named .py.\nAnd just to be clear, this is the plugin you copied, right? https://raw.github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/develop/src/livestreamer/plugins/azubutv.py\n. You don't need to create the full build (exe) to use the development version of Livestreamer.\nInstalling Python and Pip and then running python setup.py install from the Git sources should be enough. If you have used the installer to install Livestreamer you also need to run the uninstaller to remove it to avoid conflicts.\nIt would be nice with nightly builds, but I don't know how to automate stuff on Windows.\nHere's some instructions if someone wants to try to automate it:\n1. Install python+pip+virtualenv like in the link above\n2. Create a virtualenv and activate it\n3. Install bbfreeze and livestreamer\n4. Run python win32\\build-bbfreeze.py\nA build should now exist in the build-win32 directory.\n. > When I want a new version I should do \"pip uninstall livestreamer\" and then do step 8 again (install livestreamer) and then do step 9?\nI don't think this is necessary, just running install again should be enough.\n. > 1- Is that correct?\nThere has been some changes to the bbfreeze script lately so that it includes python-librtmp. This makes the process to build Livestreamer into a exe more complex since building python-librtmp and librtmp on Windows is pretty far from simple for the average user.\nBut building a distributable exe version of Livestreamer is not something users really need to bother with unless they need to distribute it themselves for some reason.\nIf you want to use the bleeding edge version of Livestreamer you don't need to build the exe though, but instead just install Python and Pip as described in this guide and then running python setup.py install from the Git sources. If you have used the installer to install Livestreamer you also need to run the uninstaller to remove it to avoid conflicts (but you may want to copy rtmpdump out of the Livestreamer directory and updating the rtmpdump path in livestreamerrc first if you intend to use RTMP streams).\n\n2- How do I run Livestreamer?\n\nUnless you specifically need to run the bleeding edge version of Livestreamer you should try using the installer available here.\n. > If I use the installer version 1.6.1 how do I update the plugins? specifically the new livestream fix?\nSave this file https://raw.github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/develop/src/livestreamer/plugins/livestream.py into the %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins directory (create it if it does not exist). This will override the built-in plugin, but make sure you remove it later when the next Livestreamer version is released so you don't miss out on any future updates to the plugin.\n. URLs containing & must be quoted in the command prompt. Try\nlivestreamer \"http://new.livestream.com/accounts/4239881/canalcapital?query=canal%20capi&cat=event\" best\nOr remove the query parameters alltogether since they're not needed:\nlivestreamer http://new.livestream.com/accounts/4239881/canalcapital best\n. Make sure you saved the new plugin correctly. It should be named \"livestream.py\" and not \"livestream.py.txt\" or something like that and be placed in %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins.\n. Git builds for Windows is now available here: http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html\n. This happened because Twitch decided to rename their streams. The \"best\" stream is only able to exist when it can rank the streams, which in this case it can't since it uses a list of names which only includes 'mobile_high' etc and not 'mobile_High' etc. \nI will force lowercase stream names in the next release to avoid this problem.\n. There's been some updates to the azubu.tv plugin lately. Either install the git version of Livestreamer or copy the git version of the plugin into %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins (Windows) or ~/.config/livestreamer/plugins (*nix).\n. Duplicate of #179.\n. Hello, this looks good except that the stream names for the livestreams could be improved.\n- the \"current_video_height\" key in the JSON can be used to make a more useful name, like \"720p\".\n- you should select a \"main server\" and then name the rest of the servers <name>_alt_<server name>. You can either use the first server in the list as \"main\" or use the geo information available in the JSON to select it more intelligently.\n. Looks good, thanks for your contribution. :)\n. > Could it be possible to add also RTMPE support for this program, cos right now those streams are not supported by livestreamer, but they work separately with rtmpdump. \nThis should already be supported, what problem are you having exactly?\n\nIt would be great if you could add HTTP Proxy feature, it's interesting for all kind of HTTP streams such as HDS, HLS and HTTP streams when those ones are not available without proxy. \n\nLivestreamer uses requests internally, which respects the env variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY, see http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies\n\nConcerning RTSP support, when I open it directly through player on almost every stream it stutters often so it would be great if you could add it through livestreamer.\n\nI'm not opposed to merging this if someones makes a pull request, but I don't plan on adding this myself. \n. > For instance how can I open this stream with livestreamer through proxy in command line?\nHow to set a environment variable may differ depending on OS/shell, but this works on Linux/bash:\n$ HTTP_PROXY=\"http://84.22.58.149:3128\" livestreamer \"hlsvariant://http://edge2.vektor.net/vektor_live/bn.stream/playlist.m3u8\"\n. > I use right now Windows. Could you explain me is there any chance to put different HTTP proxy only for several streams and not for all ? I made myself batch file with streams.\nAfter some googling, this seems to be the way to use environment variables for one process only in the Windows command prompt:\nset HTTP_PROXY=http://84.22.58.149:3128&&livestreamer \"hlsvariant://http://edge2.vektor.net/vektor_live/bn.stream/playlist.m3u8\"\n. The command I posted a few posts back works on Linux.\n\nWhy do you use \"hlsvariant\" instead of just \"hls\" for this kind of streams ?\n\nhls:// is for single stream type playlists only, while hlsvariant:// is for variant playlists, which is a playlist containing other playlists to allow multiple quality options of the same stream (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-11#section-6.2.4).\n. Thanks. :)\n. What type of stream is \"best\" in this case for you? It can either be a RTMPStream or a HLSStream depending on if you have rtmpdump installed.\nIf it is HLS then this is to be expected since HLS is not a low latency protocol by design and is usually only used on mobile platforms. For best possible latency you should access the RTMP stream called 'source', assuming it's not locked behind subscription (this is what your web browser is doing).\nYou can tell Livestreamer to only return RTMP streams like this:\nstreams = plugin.get_streams(stream_types=[\"rtmp\"])\n. Do you get any error if you run rtmpdump --help?\n. Do you have any proxy environment variables (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY) set?\nIt looks like requests thinks you want use a proxy, but fails to parse the proxy URL.\n. Hmm, what is the output from this command?\npython -c 'from requests.utils import get_environ_proxies as gep; print(gep(\"http://usher.justin.tv\"))'\n. > {'http': 'http://:@:', 'https': 'http://:@:', 'ftp': 'http://:@:'}\nBy running this command\nHTTP_PROXY=\"http://:@:\" python -c 'from requests import get; get(\"http://google.com\")'\nI was able to reproduce the same error you get, so this is not a Livestreamer bug.\nI suggest you either figure out what is setting those variables and disable it or report a bug to requests that they should ignore these values.\n. Please provide a log of this problem when running livestreamer with --loglevel debug --verbose-player.\n. Try changing line 3 to this:\ncommand = @\"twitch.tv/therainman medium --player X:\\VLC\\vlc.exe\";\nYou are already telling Windows to execute the livestreamer.exe via FileName = path so it should not be in the arguments. Also the order of the url and quality arguments was incorrect.\n. Your are specifying a invalid parameter. The -url here is interpreted by livestreamer as --plugins --rtmpdump l, which makes no sense.\n. > Why would you close it? Removing -url doesn't solve anything.\nThen you need to make sure rtmpdump is correctly specified in your livestreamerrc. Since the reason your stream is not working is because mlgsc2 has mobile streams disabled, thus only making desktop streams available, which require rtmpdump.\nIf you do not want to setup rtmpdump manually you should try using the installer which takes care of this for you.\n. > But that's what I did, I used the installer only. And it shows only some of Twitch streams, not all of them for some reason. It all got installed to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer and I run my .bat from Desktop.\nI see, looks like something may have gone wrong with your setup then. Please try reinstalling and see if that helps, if not, open %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc in a text editor and check if the path after rtmpdump= is correct and exists.\n. > Path's correct and reinstalled and nothing. You can air twitch.tv/mlgsc2 using .bat like mine ? I am on Windows 8 x64.\nI tried on Windows 7 x64 and it works as long as I remove the invalid parameter.\n. Hmm, you're still getting the [plugin.twitch][warning] rtmpdump is not usable, only mobile streams may be available message, right?\nCould you put the full contents of your %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc on a pastebin?\n. Try changing line 32 to:\nrtmpdump=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\rtmpdump.exe\n. > The docu on that file says I have to use \"\" quotes for paths with spaces\nMaybe the wording could be improved, but it says it only applies to the player option.\nOne more thing though, was the quotes there in the file that was first generated by the Livestreamer setup? It's not suppose to be, so maybe it's something going wrong on Windows 8.\n. Right now Livestreamer's plugin API is not designed to collect any metadata, but I plan to correct this in 2.0 probably.\nIn the meantime though, I could add a {url} formatter, it's not great but at least it's something.\n. > Is there any timeline for this?\nNot anytime soon at least, 2.0 is intented to be a complete rework of the plugin system and will take alot of time, which I do not have right now.\n. There was some site changes, plugin was updated to fix this.\n. > How to update plugin to fix in Ubuntu?\nInstall the Git version of Livestreamer as instructed here: http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/install.html\n. Unfortunately the config parser is a bit primitive, you need to remove the quotes.\n. Looks like you've run into this bug https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1379.\nTry upgrading requests and see if it helps.\n. I'm afraid pyCrypto (which is needed to decrypt the stream) is not included in the Windows build at the moment.\n. It will probably work, but you will need to install it in a bit special way:\n1. Download \"PyCrypto 2.6 for Python 2.7 32bit\" from the site you mentioned\n2. Open the exe file in a program capable of opening zip files (e.g 7zip, winrar)\n3. Go into the PLATLIB directory in the file, then drag the Crypto directory into your Livestreamer directory\nWhen you're done you should have a directory called Crypto in your Livestreamer installation's directory. \nThe stream you mentioned gives me a 403 forbidden error though, so I couldn't test it myself but at least it doesn't warn about pyCrypto anymore so it should be working.\n. The first URL you mention seem to not work because it does not use a valid SSL certificate.\nOn the other URLs it looks like they use some additional security. I'm not sure if they're the same, but I tried extracting a URL from the Eurosport link you mentioned in the first post, and it works for me. Maybe the URLs you tried have expired or something?\n. There is a option in requests to not verify the certificate (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification). But it doesn't seem to help in this case, I tried and ended up with a different error instead ([SSL: SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE] sslv3 alert handshake failure (_ssl.c:547)).\n. I was just testing in the Python command line tool, like this:\n```\n\n\n\nimport requests\nrequests.get(\"https://89.216.1.216/CAB/keyfile?r=42&t=DTV&p=0\", verify=False)\n```\n\n\n\nI also tested with cURL:\ncurl --insecure \"https://89.216.1.216/CAB/keyfile?r=42&t=DTV&p=0\"\nand they both reported the same error. Unless both these SSL implementations are broken I think the problem is at the server end and not the client.\n. What is the problem exactly? It looks like it was playing according to the log.\nIt gives a 404 error for me though.\n. Looks like a VLC issue. Even when letting VLC use it's own HLS player it freezes. Works fine with mpv/mplayer though.\n. As of 39008e9df12723e59b77c2da428a062ea7e1d857, you can now specify these parameters in the URL passed to livestreamer. For example:\nlivestreamer \"hls://url.net/playlist.m3u8 params={'v':'clientID'} verify=False cert=('/path/to/client.crt', '/path/to/private.key')\"\n. It's intended that every URL gets the parameters, I think it would be too complicated to try to split playlist, segment and key into separate parameters in the URL. I think it's a very small chance a server would refuse our request just cause it gets some unneeded parameters, if it becomes a problem maybe some special parameters can be added to HLSStream to allow plugins to have some more control over it.\nThe repeated parameter is very odd. I'm not able to reproduce it here. Is it possible that the server is adding any parameters it gets in the playlist request to the segments automatically?\n. I see, well there's not much I can do about that I'm afraid. I let requests handle the merging of parameters and it seems to prefer to keep the parameters in the URL rather than overwrite it. \nA simple test:\n```\n\n\n\nrequests.Request(url=\"http://example.com/segment_1.ts?v=id\", params={'v':'id'}).prepare().url\n'http://example.com/segment_1.ts?v=id&v=id'\n```\n. > @chrippa I extracted Crypto directory but can not understand where to place it. What is \"your Livestreamer installation's directory\".\n\n\nAfter running $ python setup.py install I got \"C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\livestreamer.exe\".\nI tried to place Crypto directory to C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\ but no luck.\n\nThose instructions were meant for the prebuilt binary release of Livestreamer, but it now includes PyCrypto aswell. Since you are running your own install of Python, simply running the PyCrypto installer should do the trick (make sure the installer you download matches your Python version and CPU arch).\n\nI have a stream encrypted by Verimatrix. I can view it with ViewRight Web plugin.\nI extracted my client certificate using traffic sniffer. But I have no idea where to search my private key.\nIs it possibly to find this key and decrypt a stream with livestreamer? Or the key is secured by Verimatrix and is not accessible by me?\n\nI have no idea where to get your key, but if you find it might be possible to use the --http-ssl-cert-crt-key option in Livestreamer.\n. > Livestreamer doesn't support rtmp\nWhat do you mean by this?\n. > Mips\nI think this plugin might require rtmpdump with @K-S-V's patches, but I'm not sure. Maybe the author of the plugin, @athoik, knows more?\n\nThis livestream.com channel doesn't work with plugin through rtmp.\n\nIt was a while since I looked into adding this (#112), but now that python-librtmp is released, maybe someone wants to investigate further and submit a pull request?\n\nIlive changed token (-T)\n\nThey sure made this a whole lot trickier now by hiding a encrypted token inside the SWF. But \n4d94fe18a6c8846f24931c31e1797751c0983017 now implements this.\n\nBy the way, while downloading HLS streams I found that MPEG-TS streams made with Procaster play fine, the ones made with xSplit are completely broken (file size seems to be correct though).\n\nDo you have any example URLs?\n. The Mips plugin should be fixed with 11ff0e42fe65d40d21f98f1a8ba614cedfb8bd13. A RTMP parameter was missing. Vanilla rtmpdump works btw, it does not require any patches.\n\nMeanwhile I tried to install python-librtmp, but got stuck.\n\nBuilding Python modules on Windows is indeed painful. MSVC is required to build Python modules properly. And in this case I also needed to create a \"rtmp.lib\" file to be able to use a existing MingW librtmp.dll.\nLuckily, recently pip added support for the wheel format (this is a package format which supports binaries). I've uploaded some wheels for Python 2.7 and 3.3 (only 32-bit since cffi does not work with Win64 atm). You can install it using this command (pip 1.4 is required):\npip install --use-wheel python-librtmp\nAlso, make sure you also have a librtmp.dll in a directory in your PATH. Though, if you just want to use python-librtmp with Livestreamer, then it is already included in the Windows builds.\n. > Out of curiosity, how did you get rtmp.lib? Did you build rtmpdump with MSVC compiler? Were there no need to rewrite some code of it? MingW made only .a libraries for me.\nI can't remember exactly what command I used, but I was able to create it by first creating a rtmp.def (a text file with a list of all the functions exported from the dll). I've uploaded the files I used here. The dll is cross-compiled from Linux with MingW.\n\nViewed with Softlink SWF Decompiler I see some functions that might help. Still would need to find a way to call them though. Wonder if python-librtmp will help with that.\n\nMaybe I misinterpret, but you can't call SWF functions with python-librtmp. You can however connect to a RTMP server and call it's server side methods with python-librtmp. I think the best place to start is to look what methods are called by sniffing the traffic using Wireshark.\n. > Could you also add support for http://www.iguide.to? I guess they use same system like Ilive. ;)\nNot likely. It seems to use a different decryption algorithm. For ilive I simply ported someone else's code to Python, it's a whole other thing to reverse engineer the algorithm from scratch.\n. > azubutv : http://www.azubu.tv/channel/detail.do?cn_id=2258602895001&menu=3\nThis is a VOD, not a live stream. If the \"live\" image in the player is not highlighted it is not live.\n\nlivestream.com : http://new.livestream.com/popsugar/live\n\nWas fixed a couple of weeks ago with 13cccc804ecf182b0fead69e9c8352bc37f24d3b.\n\nsvtplay : http://www.svtplay.se/video/1542107/svt-forum\n\nStrange issue with the HDS streams only.

This sounds like a good idea and I will probably add it.\nIn the mean time I think --twitch-legacy-names might help a bit. At least when the source stream is not higher quality than what you exclude.\n. What version of OpenSSL do you have?\n. Hmm, I think your librtmp is not correctly linked with OpenSSL somehow. What does ldd /usr/lib/librtmp.so (or ldd /usr/lib/*/librtmp.so if that path does not exist) output?\n. > Looks like you hit something there, I can't locate librtmp.so but I do have librtmp.so.0 \nMight be a Ubuntu thing to not have the librtmp.so, but I don't think it's the problem here.\n\nI've tried just linking it with ln -s but that didn't seem to make a difference, I guess something is missing here?\n\nWhat does this output  ldd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/python_librtmp-0.1.2-py2.7-linux-i686.egg/librtmp_ffi/_binding.so? \nAlso, do you get any error when running rtmpdump?\n. I see, well the python-librtmp has only been tested with the official librtmp. I'm afraid you're on your own if you want to use patched versions since they may introduce API breaking changes. \n. This should be fixed with 39008e9df12723e59b77c2da428a062ea7e1d857.\n\nhttp://94.247.234.3/streaming/francetv_ft3/ipad.m3u8\n\nThere are no comments in these playlists, the segments simply does not seem to exist. If it works in some other player software, check if something special is done in the HTTP request to the segment.\n. > i don\u00b4t have any idea what i\u00b4m doing and i didn\u00b4t find any help anywhere.\nThe documentation for Livestreamer is available here:  http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/\nI recommend you start by reading the tutorial.\n. > the tutorial tells me i have to add the stream in the editor and start the program. everything should work. but it don\u00b4t. so now i have no idea what comes now\nI have no idea what editor you are talking about. The white text after the dollar sign ($ is commonly used to represent the command prompt) in the dark boxes on the tutorial site are commands you can type in your command prompt. \n. > with editor i mean the livestreamerrc file.\nI'm afraid you've missunderstood. The commands in the tutorial are meant to be typed into the command prompt, the livestreamerrc file is only used for settings.\nFor example, open the command prompt and type \"livestreamer twitch.tv/channel\".\n. Looks like there is some connection problem. Are you behind some firewall perhaps? Or it could be a issue with their servers.\n. Actually I see the same thing here, looks like a server issue.\n. This will happen if your stream falls too far behind due to lack of bandwidth on either your end or the servers. Try lowering the quality.\n. I looked into this a while back (#94) but it doesn't seem possible without using a proxy. You can tell livestreamer to use a proxy for it's HTTP requests with the \"HTTP_PROXY\" environment variable, e.g. \"HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9999\".\n. PAC files won't be supported unless Requests adds support for them, which is pretty unlikely since they seem to be written in JavaScript.\nThe proxy in that file is a bit special since it's made for Twitch specifically and blocks any request other than the stream info request so you can't use it with the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. You have to modify the plugin to use it for that purpose only. I don't plan to add a option in livestreamer for this since it's very specific for this proxy and if you have any other proxy you can just use HTTP_PROXY anyway, but here is a patch you can try:\n``` patch\ndiff --git a/src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py b/src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py\nindex 95fd4b0..961bc56 100644\n--- a/src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py\n+++ b/src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py\n@@ -55,7 +55,7 @@ class UsherService(object):\n         params = dict(p=int(random() * 999999), type=\"any\",\n                       private_code=password or \"null\", **extra_params)\n\nreturn res_json(urlget(url, params=params),\n\nreturn res_json(urlget(url, params=params, proxies=dict(http=\"http://173.236.101.38:9191\")),\n                         \"stream info JSON\")\ndef create_playlist_token(self, channel):\n\n\n```\nIt renames the streams though, so I recommened you use --twitch-legacy-names to avoid odd-looking names.\n. I'm just a bit hesitant adding a option that's just for a specific proxy, since using the HTTP_PROXY environment variable works with any other proxy, but I'll think about it.\n. Cool, I didn't know about no_proxy. Then this should work if you want to use that specific proxy without any modifications:\nhttp_proxy=\"http://173.236.101.38:9191\" no_proxy=\"www-cdn.jtvnw.net\" livestreamer twitch.tv/channel\nHowever, I've noticed that some servers only allow access if you are in that region, since sometimes I get this from their servers:\ntv.justin.usher.AuthenticationUtils$UsherAuthException: ERR011: The token is not valid in your country\n. You can tell livestreamer how to name the sub-streams in variant playlists with the namekey parameter. Valid values are \"name\", \"pixels\" and \"bandwidth\". \n. Thank you for the report but this was fixed a while ago (6dd8b40800d77b95e956f2bf85c7b9f989b8c8ea) and will be available in the next release which will be out soon.\n. Remove the -url parameter.\n. > Maybe there is further tuning, eg use the FLVContact or use Tag etc?\nYes, that is probably a good idea. You should be able to inherit FLVTagConcat and override the iter_tags method, put your decryption and tag creation logic here and yield the resulting Tags. You probably want to pass flatten_timestamps=True to it aswell, unless the timestamps start at 0 in each segment.\nA few more things I noticed:\n- Please don't use camelCasing, use snake_casing instead.\n- Split the decryption function into smaller parts, such as create_decryptor, read_create_tag\n- Use StreamIOIterWrapper from stream.wrappers instead of StringIO to be able to stream the segment, e.g. fd = StreamIOIterWrapper(res.iter_content(8192)) and set stream=True on the HTTP request.\n- The Crypto package is an optional dependancy, catch the ImportError like in hls.py and warn about missing library in the plugin if needed.\n. @athoik, this is what I had in mind when I meant you should use Tag:\n``` python\nCreate video tag\nif typ == 1:\n    if config:\n        avc = AVCVideoData(AVC_PACKET_TYPE_SEQUENCE_HEADER, data=data)\n    else:\n        avc = AVCVideoData(AVC_PACKET_TYPE_NALU, data=data)\nif keyframe:\n    videodata = VideoData(VIDEO_FRAME_TYPE_KEY_FRAME,\n                          VIDEO_CODEC_ID_AVC, avc)\nelse:\n    videodata = VideoData(VIDEO_FRAME_TYPE_INTER_FRAME,\n                          VIDEO_CODEC_ID_AVC, avc)\n\nyield Tag(TAG_TYPE_VIDEO, time, videodata)\n\nCreate audio tag\nif typ == 2:\n    if config:\n        aac = AACAudioData(AAC_PACKET_TYPE_SEQUENCE_HEADER, data)\n    else:\n        aac = AACAudioData(AAC_PACKET_TYPE_RAW, data)\naudiodata = AudioData(codec=AUDIO_CODEC_ID_AAC,\n                      rate=AUDIO_RATE_44_KHZ,\n                      bits=AUDIO_BIT_RATE_16,\n                      type=AUDIO_TYPE_STEREO,\n                      data=aac)\n\nyield Tag(TAG_TYPE_AUDIO, time, audiodata)\n\n```\nEdit: Also, please use BytesIO instead of StringIO, it's not available on Python 3.\nEdit2: Also move the tag and decryption code into the BeatFLVTagConcat class and you can simplify the iter_tags method by not touching skip_header and self.tags since it's no needed.\n. Do you have some example URLs for version 1 videos? I think using RawData(data) instead of the Audio/VideoData for version 1 should work.\n. Great, a couple of minor things I noticed:\n- Line 177: The self.closed check needs to be inside the iter_chunks loop.\n- In BeatStreamWorker, you can remove the getChunks method and just yield the chunks in iter_segments without storing them\n- NoStreamsError does not need to be imported\nOnce those things are fixed I think you can create a pull request, nice work :thumbsup: \n. It looks like it's a problem with Livestream.com's HLS transcoder. I'm getting warnings like this in ffmpeg based players:\nThis stream was generated by a broken encoder, invalid 8x8 inference\nAnd it doesn't seem to be a transport issue as letting vlc/mpv/ffplay do the HLS transport itself (--player-passthrough hls) doesn't change anything. I guess the best solution is to add support for the RTMP stream in the plugin, assuming it's playable.\n. You need to have a {filename} in your -a argument for playback to work, try -a \"--config C:\\Users\\Me\\Desktop\\vlcrc {filename}\".\nAlso, you need to remove the pound sign (#) from your vlcrc or it will be counted as a comment.\n. > Not sure if this is intended, but I ditched the directory info, because it just created a renamed vlcrc file in the livestreamer directory called UsersMeDesktopvlcrc and VLC used that. \nThis is a bug. It's caused by shlex removing bash-slashes that are not escaped. I fixed it for the --player option but forgot to also do it on --player-args it seems.\n. What version of requests 2.0 do you use exactly? I have tested it both with 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 and have not run into this issue.\n. It looks like requests 2.0 uses an attribute that was not available until Python 2.6.3. I changed setup.py to force 1.x on those versions with 0ebafa76dc242b906715f594b3d646b26f023f22.\n. This used to be the case, but it was brought to my attention that version 1.x of VLC does not support the --file-caching option and instead caused an error, so it was removed.\nI am considering making the --player-http option the deault in the future so that the network caching value will always be used instead since it will transport the stream over HTTP instead of a pipe.\n. Well, there is already some info about this here: http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/issues.html#streams-are-buffering-lagging\nI guess I could put it into the tutorial section aswell.\n. Nice fixes, thanks.\n. Hmm, I think this could be improved a bit.\n- Since you describe the process of getting a pvhash from a SWF, we might aswell just accept a swf argument instead and then create the hash ourself.\n- The urlappendix doesn't seem needed, you can just put the query params in the rsession.params dict instead. This also takes care of any quoting needed.\n- Don't use the logger to report the error about missing an argument when a pvtoken is found in the manifest, raise a IOError exception instead.\n. > That would probably be a good idea, though I think it should also try to cache the hashes to avoid needlessly downloading the SWF over and over, similar to what \u201crtmpdump --swfVfy\u201d does (though the hash method is different). I thought this would be a significant amount of work, but now I found you already have some generic caching support, as used in revision 85eb4fa. I\u2019ll use that as a base, and hopefully add an \u201dIf-Modified-Since\u201d HTTP condition if it\u2019s not too hard.\nYeah, that makes sense, I suggest you add a Cache object to the Stream base class similarliy to how the Plugin class does it. \n\nWill do, although I think I\u2019ll need to parse apart the name=value halves of one of the params, which comes directly from the  element.\n\nYou can use the parse_qsd function (dict version of parse_qsl from urllib.parse) from utils for this.\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Hmm, I guess checking the date format is not really necessary. The HTTP spec does not even seem to specify a specific date format, it's simply advised to use the Last-Modified header from the server, whatever that may be. But since we write this to disk we should probably check that it's not abnormally long at least.\n. Since the Python documentation recommends not to mess with the locale in a library and the fact that we don't need to parse the date I've decided to just use a length check instead to keep it simple.\n. Do you have a example URL?\n. It seems like channels that are in \"replay\" mode return a stream that does not return any data. Would it be possible to either support the \"replay\" video stream or simply return no streams on such channels?\n. Make sure librtmp is also updated. If that doesn't help, try running with --errorlog and then find the log file in /tmp and paste the contents.\n. The fragment 404'ing in your log is no longer returning 404 so it was probably just some temporary glitch on their server.\n. Did you use the zip or installer version of Livestreamer?\nIf zip, then you need to download rtmpdump and configure it yourself in %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc like this:\nrtmpdump=C:\\path\\to\\rtmpdump.exe\nIf you used the installer, please paste the contents of your %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\livestreamerrc file. The installer is supposed to have taken care of rtmpdump setup automatically.\n. > From experience with MPC-HC + Livestreamer it's worth noting that if you let it buffer for \"too long\" it will close out.\nI'm not sure, but I think what's happening here is that if you pause for too long the buffer in MPC-HC will get full and thus stops reading data from Livestreamer which also causes Livestreamer to stop reading data from the stream and will probably be dropped by the server for being idle.\nYou can however tell Livestreamer to keep reading data from the stream even if the player stopped reading data from Livestreamer by increasing the ringbuffer size with --ringbuffer-size. For example you could use --ringbuffer-size 268435456 to allow up to 256MB to buffer (this is a bit extreme but would probably allow you to pause for 30 min or more depending on stream quality).\n\nAfter trying every option and tweaks, I tried to use livestreamer rtmpdump url and play it on XBMC. I watched it on Source(best) without any lags in two days. It would be nice if livestreamer implement some simple plugin (xbmc uses python, so it shouldn't be too hard. Maybe even I'll do it myself ^^)\n\nIf you only need Twitch you could try https://github.com/StateOfTheArt89/Twitch.tv-on-XBMC.\n. Your OS X version ships an older version Python 2.6 that is not compatible with requests 2.0. Try downgrading your requests to 1.2.3 (pip install requests==1.2.3) or upgrade your Python version.\n. I don't know what that error means but you could try upgrading your VLC if it's not the latest and make sure it can play other H264 content aswell to rule out any codec issue.\n. On what stream URL does this happen?\n. Hmm, this is really strange.\nI did some testing and it seems like if you use the rtmpdump command from --cmdline manually, then the outputted file will have a duration. At first I thought it was some bug in pbs (a subprocess wrapper Livestreamer uses) but even when using a minimal test case (https://gist.github.com/chrippa/b4a9803da6df3dcd1f7a) it produces a file with no duration.\n. > \u201crtmpdump\u201d might be doing some file cleanup when you interrupt it\nLooking at the source that does not seem to be the case, I thought it would update the duration metadata in the header, but that is not the case as the duration field is set to 0.0 on both files.\nI also tried to use librtmp directly to read the stream via python-librtmp and it produced a file with correct duration and there is no seeking involved there.\nBut there is something going on with the pipes I think, as when I tried to pipe it through cat as you suggested it produced a file without duration aswell.\nMy current theory is that the players are unable to figure out a duration if the file ends without a complete FLV tag. I think what happens is that RTMP_Read will always round off the data at a tag ending, but when we read from a pipe we can end up with tags broken up in pieces. Thus if the stream reading is interrupted before the stream is complete we may write a incomplete tag at the end of the file.\nI don't think there is a simple fix for this, best option is probably to use python-librtmp for stream reading in the future. But I don't really consider that binding mature until cffi has reached 1.0 so I don't want to make it default just yet.\n. > Are you able to reproduce this issue? If not I'm willing to test some stuff for you guys.\nYes, I was able to reproduce it. I'm pretty sure my theory is correct now, since I wrote a small script that verifies that all the tags are complete and discards any that aren't. This script fixed my test files, and it also fixed the incorrect duration on the file you just uploaded.\nThis issue should probably not happen unless you interrupt the stream though, if it reaches end naturally it should work as expected. A workaround is to make a small script that just grabs the rtmpdump command line from livestreamer --cmdline and adds -o <filename> to it to let rtmpdump handle the file output.\n. The script expects livestreamer to be installed, if you're on Windows you should be able to drop the script in the livestreamer directory and run it from there.\n. Looks like python eggs aren't picked up for some reason, try putting it in the sub folder named livestreamer-1.8.0-py2.7.egg instead.\n. I've changed the veetle plugin (2027bd53007ffc28a379a0fcd87d095df6673505) to verify the FLV tags before writing them, this should probably fix the issue of multiple FLVs in a single stream.\n. I left some comments on your code, please check and correct the plugin as necessary. Also run pep8 on your code to fix any style issues (long lines are ok to leave as is).\nWhen you are done you should commit your changes and then merge your commits into a single one by using interactive rebasing (git rebase -i <commit-hash-of-the-last-commit-before-yours>). This will rewrite your history so you need to forcefully push your changes to Github (git push --force).\n. I'm not sure if this will help your issues, but you may want to try using the --player-no-close option. By default Livestreamer will close the player when the stream is over, but if the player has cached a decent amount the stream may seem to end abruptly.\nThis behaviour has been around since the first version of Livestreamer since I wanted to close the VLC GUI after the stream was over. But I realize this is not very optimal for VOD content and I will consider changing it in the future.\n. Ah, I see. I don't know if omxplayer prints any output, but if you run with --verbose-player you can see it and it might help finding out whats going wrong.\n. @vadmium is there any downside to always do the wait call? Seems like the sensible thing to do even if we send a kill signal first.\n. > Or do you mean calling wait in all cases, and dropping the behaviour of letting the player run in the background?\nI'm pretty sure we always need to have the player as a background process unless we want to use a thread for  the stream IO. But I meant that we probably don't need another command line option and can just do the wait call in all cases.\nIt was a while since I wrote the original player code, but I don't think there was any reason that I left the wait out. So I think as long as we close the input before waiting it should be fine.\n. Thanks, but please use rebase instead of merge to bring your tree up to sync next time. I don't want your merge commits in my tree. :)\n. I'm afraid the first patch is no good. We can't quote the cmd here or it would result in values such as \"player --arg\" not getting split. It should already be possible to use a player path with spaces by quoting it yourself, e.g --player \"'/c/Program Files (x86)/VideoLAN/VLC/vlc'\".\n@vadmium We must use shlex.split to support player values such as \"player --arg\".\n. Works fine here, do you get any errors?\n. Twitch has done a major overhaul of their video system and has retired the RTMP streams and only use HLS now. The next Livestreamer release will update the plugin properly for these changes, but the HLS streams should be available as mobile_* streams in Livestreamer 1.7.1.\nPlease verify that you actually are running 1.7.1 with livestreamer -V, I was not able to reproduce your issues on this version.\n. Put this in your configuration file:\nrtmpdump=C:\\path\\to\\your\\rtmpdump.exe\nDid you try using the installer? It will do this for you automatically.\n. It looks like you may have put some invalid parameters in your configuration file.\n. It looks like you are actually running an older version of Livestreamer. If you have installed Livestreamer in a different directory before but forgot to uninstall it, it may be causing a conflict with the new version.\n. Does this also happen with --player-passthrough rtmp,hls?\n. Hmm, then it looks like a problem with mplayer2, since that option essentialy makes livestreamer only grab a URL and pass it to the player without doing any transport. \nHave you tried mpv (another mplayer fork)? I'm using it myself without any problems.\n. Thanks!\n. I think this may be a bug with VLC's pulseaudio output. I also ran into this after upgrading VLC to 2.1, when using the pulseaudio output module I got the same issue as you, but when I switched to the ALSA module (I use a asoundrc to forward ALSA audio to pulse) I didn't get it any more. \n. > config: http://pastebin.com/1xSjU1Zw\nIf you look at line 14 and 21, you'll notice that you removed # from lines that were originally comments, thus causing your error as they are interpreted as options instead.\n. Do you use some proxy/VPN that might mess with your HTTPS traffic? Does Twitch work in your browser? What OS are you using?\n. > Maybe a command line option could take care of this?\nYes, I'm currently working on a overhaul of the internal HTTP usage in Livestreamer and that will make it possible to add a --http-no-ssl-verify option.\nBut that is still just a workaround. So far I've figured out that there is something funky with the certificate Twitch is using, which is signed by Godaddy. The Crunchyroll plugin is also having this issue and it is using a Godaddy certificate aswell.\nIt's unknown what exactly is causing this but it is known to happen when using version 20140223-1 of the ca-certificates package in Arch Linux. If this turns out to be a widespread issue it might be worth setting verify to False in the affected plugins though.\n. I opted for a sligthly different fix in 5f6a3d3fe24f50b161be66e711db2989eea1e378. Thanks for your effort though.\n. The playlist is containing multiple playlists with same bitrate/resolution but only the first one of each quality is not returning 404. The problem is that Livestreamer is always choosing the last playlist specified for each quality while VLC is using the first it finds. The spec doesn't seem to specifiy how this should be handled, so I guess we could change the behaviour to match VLC.\n. This is a limitation of the current plugin. The #112 issue will be updated if there is any changes.\n. Looks good, I found a few minor issues though:\n- You made a typo on line 225, should be warning, not warn\n- You added --crunchyroll-purge-credentials to playeropt, should be pluginopt\n- Add the new CLI options to docs/cli.rst\n- Add yourself to AUTHORS if you wish\n- Add stream weights, see src/livestreamer/plugins/justintv_common.py for a example on how to do this.\n- The 'adaptive' stream returned is actually a variant playlist containing the 'mid' and 'high' streams and should be ignored since Livestreamer doesn't support adaptive streaming.\n- You marked the plugin as capable of handling live streams in docs/plugin_matrix.rst, but the only live stream I found is on http://www.crunchyroll.com/live which ended a long time ago. So I assume it hasn't been tested or not supported at all in the plugin? Or are there other live streams?\nAnd yes, I would prefer it if you squashed the commits.\n. Great, thanks!\n. What steps did you do exactly?\nThese steps should work fine:\n1. Type %appdata% into the address bar of the Windows file explorer\n2. Right click in the directory and create a \"livestrearmer\" directory (if it does not already exist)\n3. Create your configuration file in a text edtior and save it in the directory you just created as \"livestreamerrc\". Make sure you save it as \"livestreamerrc\" and not \"livestreamerrc.txt\".\n. Since Livestreamer is focused on live streams and not VODs it is not part of the design to support seeking at the moment.\nYou don't mention what type of VOD you're trying to use, but the Twitch plugin has special support for seeking into broadcasts since this was required to implement the \"highlight\" type VODs. This is done by using the t parameter. Example URL: http://www.twitch.tv/liquidhero/b/297908075?t=102m38s\n. I'm not able to reproduce this. I also get a few errors, but they don't cause any problems. Could you paste a log with the errors?\n. Well, the fact that is works sometimes but not always may mean my implementation of their streaming protocol is not correct. I was able to reproduce the issue on the second channel you posted. This channel works consistently for me though, is it the same for you?\n. I've pushed some changes to the ustream streaming which I believe should fix most issues, please try the latest git version.\n(Windows builds can be found here: http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html)\n. > I would then get the following error when I tried to play it with VLC:\n\nNo suitable decoder module:\nVLC does not support the audio or video format \"undf\". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.\nThe file will play audio, but no video.\n\nI believe what is happening is that sometimes a segment will only contain audio, and even if the next segment contains video it will end up confusing at least ffmpeg based players since it seems to rely on scanning the first few FLV tags to see what it contains.\nWe might be able to work around this by analyzing the stream and not outputting segments until we found one which contains both audio and video.\n\nI need to do some more testing to see if this is a time dependent thing, I know it happened as soon as I started livestreamer one time, but not usually. I was outputting to a file, not to VLC directly. Funny thing is, I was using RTMPDump and RTMPSuck for awhile, but Usteam must have changed something recently since RMTPSuck won't work on it anymore but livestreamer does, to a point. I can't find the command line string for RTMPDump.\n\nUStream has pretty much dropped the usual  RTMP streams and are now using a special RTMP + segmented HTTP stream type which Livestreamer attempts to implement. But the implementation is based on reverse engineering the protocol so it's not perfect yet.\n\nAlso, not sure if this is normal, but the \"Written\" size increases fast for a short time, then stops for some time. It appears that when this stops, the file gets written to. I believe this may cause the end of the output file to get truncated when the stream ends since it exits before the file is fully written. I still need to test this more. \n\nThe start and stop is happening because the UStream server gives us a list of FLV segments in bursts every few seconds, so it is not because of disk I/O and no data should be lost.\n\nAlso not sure why the quality is being detected so low. At home (slower connection), I get 720P on most streams but at work they are only \"mobile_240p\" or \"mobile_480p\".\n\nThis error\n\n[plugin.ustreamtv][error] Unable to fetch desktop streams: Failed to connect to\nRTMP server\n\nseem to indicate that your work firewall is probably blocking the connection to UStream's RTMP server which is required to access the streams normally found in the web player.\n. I believe the audio only issue should be fixed with 1816c69de0224e6a1d0a8688e6008f9aaea49d15. What happened was that sometimes the H264 header came a few seconds after the AAC header in a segment, this caused a desync which confused player software. We now wait for both headers to make it all synced up. \n. Please run with --loglevel debug in the future, it contains some extra information. I haven't been able to reproduce this myself, watched about 45 min of that stream.\n. It looks like the thread that is responsible for fetching the segments gets stuck. Most likely what happens is that the HTTP request never times out, which is probably caused by a bug currently existing in the HTTP library we use (requests) where the timeout is not applied to streaming responses (it will be fixed in the next version though).\nI've pushed a workaround that will attempt to downlaod the whole segment in one go which should make the timeout work correctly. Downside with this approach is that we have to wait for each segment to be fully downloaded before it can be sent to the player.\n. You might want to try using an alternative CDN if you're having trouble with many missing segments, e.g. 720p+_alt_akamai. It's suprising you would end up with missing segments in the first place though, as it attempts to download each segment 3 times. I have never seen a segment download fail more than once.\n. Are you referring to 5ebf5af0933f899ce7b7c3e3f73378ce9a50348e? The timeout stuff referred to there only affects streaming responses, which the ustream plugin does not currently use.\nAbout your issues, it is likely my implementation is slightly wrong since it's based purely on analyzing the network traffic. I have to decompile the flash player to get a better look how this works, but haven't gotten around to it yet.\n. Ah, right, I changed the plugin to use non-streaming responses with 3c3e81deff6d8dd934002bc08a596dbb6276f26e though, so that is not an issue anymore.\n. Streaming the segments is better in theory since it allows data to flow faster to the output. But in case of errors it can cause incomplete segments to be written, with non-streaming segments we instead get either the full segment or skip it completly (it gives up after 3 attempts to download it). Since we live in a world were internet connections are not always perfect I think going with non-streaming segments is the safest, and I'll probably change other streaming types (HLS) to do the same aswell.\n. No, that's not what's happening, there are precautions in place to prevent issues like that. I accidently made the stream think it had one less segment available than it really has in d3a843bc9a83b5a625a60a02b428f4581ec4aa0d, but I've pushed a fix now.\n. > I am using the --retry-streams option and at times it won't capture the beginning of cuts off the end.\nI did some testing by sending a stream myself to ustream and it seems there is a delay from where I start the stream on my end and when ustream will let me access it, it's usually between 15 and 30 seconds, is that what you're seeing?\nI actually noticed a big bug where writer thread could be ended prematurely by the worker thread and I've pushed a fix, this was likely the cause for missing data at the end.\n\nThe other issue that is more peculiar, is that it, at times, will not sync the audio and video. I was trying to do some testing on this but think it only occurs when outputed to a file, not to VLC.\n\nThis is really odd, we have code that will make sure any gaps from missing chunks will be fixed by adjusting the timestamps. I've tested this by telling the stream to ignore some chunks, and it always works correctly both on file and in player.\n. This is not a HLS playlist. It looks like a smooth streaming  playlist, which is not supported by Livestreamer.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this. Does it also happen if you use --player-passthrough hls?\n. No stutter at all, the music plays perfectly. Are you using any caching? I've noticed VLC can be a bit strange if it does not have any cache sometimes.\n. Is everyone who has this issue using VLC?\n. Hmm, if you write the stream to a file (-o filename.ts) first, does it download?\n. Thanks for investigating. I believe this should now be fixed. If you wish, you can try the latest change with this build: http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/livestreamer-v1.7.4-22-g7697937-win32.zip\n. Livestreamer uses requests to do the transfer of the stream. Unfortunately requests does not support SOCKS proxies at this time.\nA workaround however, is to use the  --player-passthrough hls option to forward the stream URL to the player instead of transporting it in Livestreamer and then setup your player to use a proxy. I believe VLC has support for SOCKS.\n. Does this only happen on this specific channel? I tried a bunch of channels and was not able to reproduce this error.\n. Hmm, I'm gonna need you to modify the plugin to add some more debug info.\nAdd this to line 54 in src/livestreamer/plugins/hitbox.py and run the setup again.\npython\n        print(json)\nThen paste the output from livestreamer.\n. Add it on the line after bitrates = ....\n. I have no idea why your JSON result is different from mine, but it should be fixed with e3423a4cb5a22ab56243b4f0af9acc1a5794d9bc.\n. I'm a bit confused what you mean by black screen? Does it work if you use a player that doesn't use -n (fifo)?\n. As @vadmium mentioned passing headers works with some URLs, (hls://, hlsvariant:// and httpstream://) but this is kind of hacky. The problem right now is that there is no common HTTP session between the plugins and the streams that they create.\nThe plan is to create a HTTP session in Plugin.get_streams() and then make sure everything uses that. This would then make it trivial to setup things like headers and it will all get passed along nicely down to the streams. I've added this to the roadmap for 1.8.\n. Try putting some cache options in your configuration file. Keep in mind though that Livestreamer is not a magical fix for connection issues.\n. Livestreamer is a command line tool, if you're not familiar how to use the command prompt I suggest you google that first and then follow the tutorial for Livestreamer.\n. Try pip install --upgrade livestreamer.\n. > OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/livestreamer-1.5.2-py2.7.egg'\nYou need higher permissions to write to this location. Try the command with sudo.\n. Not all players are able to read data from the standard input pipe. Using --player-http or --player-fifo might help.\n. I think this should be fixed with dd3447f0298af051c1b4d2304cb90b72414e91e5.\n. Livestream.com is already supported, what channel are you having trouble with?\n. As @karlo2105 mentioned only HLS streams are supported in the plugin currently. You mentioned in your first post that you know how to access these streams, perhaps you could share your findings or contribute a patch?\n. Closing this to keep all related discussion in one issue (#112).\n. Twitch does not use RTMP anymore, they are using HLS which uses --http-proxy.\n. --http-proxy only works with HTTP proxies not SOCKS like Putty creates. If you want to use a SOCKS proxy you can use --player-passthrough hls (this passes the HLS URL to VLC) and then set your proxy in VLC settings.\n. Using --player-passthrough hls might help you with your audio issue as reported in #267. But if you want to record video you do not need to use VLC, you can use -o filename.ts instead to make Livestreamer write to a file directly.\n. It should be part of the URL, e.g. http://www.twitch.tv/liquidhero/b/297908075?t=102m38s\n. It seems you have a file located in the default VLC path, this is why it attempts to use it, but it fails to execute for some reason.\nWe currently only do a simple check in common directories to find a player, if you have any suggestions on how this could be improved I would appreciate it.\n. > Perhaps you could check system environments?\nDo you mean environment variables? The only useful information there is the correct name for \"Program Files\", and we already use that.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Please paste the output from livestreamer --json <channel>.\n. Hmm, that's the exact output I get aswell so we are using the same server and parameters. But I do not have any problems playing the stream here. Maybe you have a firewall blocking port 1935?\n. Hmm, it's odd that it works in the browser for you. I tried to block port 1935 on my computer just to see if I would reproduce the same error. I got the same error but the web player did not work for me so it's not like the web player is falling back on port 80 or something.\nTwitch is unrelated here since it does not use the same streaming protocol as hitbox and dailymotion.\nThere is one more thing you can do to provide some more debug info, run livestreamer with --errorlog and then open the directory %TEMP% and find the last file created there, it should be named something with livestreamer and paste contents here.\n. I also get that warning so that is not the cause. I don't know much about Windows firewalls but, is it possible you have one enabled but with an exception for your browser?\n. That is intended, as mentioned on the download page the zip does not contain rtmpdump and is meant for people who only want a minimal download.\n. I don't really know why, but if you run with one these options: --player-http, --player-continuous-http or --player-fifo together with --verbose-player it works.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. No, it's not possible right now. Do you have an example of a channel with password?\n. > This one: http://ustream.tv/racefansonly2015\n\"Sorry, the page you requested cannot be found.\"\n. I believe both the mobile app and web player uses a custom a stream protocol which we do not support. The only streams we can use are the HLS streams found on the mobile website meant for iPhone/iPad (m.afreeca.com), which I believe do not support HD since you can't even login there.\n. Thanks!\n. It's stuff like this the API is for.\nI don't know what software you are using to analyze the video stream with, but I think the correct way of doing this is to continously read the stream from a pipe and feed it to your analyzer and not using temporary files.\n. Livestreamer will only transport the stream, you'll need something else to do the decoding, such as ffmpeg. \nHere's a couple of links that may be helpful:\n- Create a thumbnail image every X seconds of the video\n- Read and Write Video Frames in Python Using FFMPEG\n. That's nice, but please add it to the wiki and/or write a post on the mailing list. The issue tracker should generally be used for issues/feature requests.\n. The -p parameter is really meant for actual players, but you can pipe the data instead, e.g.\nlivestreamer -O url stream | ffmpeg -i - test.flv\n. Thanks!\n. All the channels you mention works perfectly for me, both on high and low.\n. Well, the player also needs to be able to stream over HTTP. Try running with --verbose-player to see if omxplayer prints any error.\n. Thanks!\n. Please explain what you mean by putting the stream into xsplit? I don't know much about xsplit but doesn't it just capture your screen including the video player?\n. Is this on a specific stream? I just tried watching a few of the top streams and they worked fine for more than 5 min.\nYou can automatically reconnect to streams you get disconnected from if you use --player-continuous-http and set your player to repeat mode, maybe it will help here?\n. The Youtube plugin is primarily made for live streams, it just happens to work on most videos aswell. Try using youtube-dl if you want to access videos that don't work in Livestreamer.\n. Thanks!\n. Do you get any error messages in the console? Also, can you link me a VOD where you know this is happening?\n. I just tried to watch that VOD for about an hour (at 4x speed in mpv) but was not able to notice any jumps. \nDo you know if you have any connection issues with Twitch? Twitch VODs are split up into 30 min segments and it's possible that the connection was broken in the middle of one which would cause it to skip to the next one. \nIt's also possible there is an issue with MPC-HC, you could try VLC or mpv and see if it helps.\n. I see, it's probable Twitch closes the connection if we don't read any data for a while. There is an internal buffer that when is filled up we stop reading data, until the player reads from the buffer again. \nIt's possible to increase the size of this buffer (default is 16MB) with --ringbuffer-size, which will allow more data to be downloaded in the background even if you pause. For example --ringbuffer-size 268435456 would set the size to 256MB instead, but this also means it can use up to 256MB of RAM if you pause for a long time.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Make sure you're running MPC-HC 1.7+.\n. Seems to be related to this codec pack \"KCP\" you're using. With the MPC-HC included in that I got the same error as you while vanilla MPC-HC still works.\n. Nice find, since it seems to be Youtube specific it should be in the plugin.\n. The stream you linked returns \"This video is private\" for me, maybe that's why it's happening?\nSince there are no error messages the playlist returned is valid but has no new entries.\n. Something seems very wrong with that stream. It behaves the same in the browser, plays a few segments then stops.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here, is it also happening with other channels?\n. I've pushed some changes to the ustream streaming which I believe should fix most issues, please try the latest git version.\n(Windows builds can be found here: http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html)\n. > Now this is odd... wanted to try it out, now NasaTV seems to be lacking the 720p stream. Is it just me?\nSame here, looks like they lowered the quality of their stream.\n. Thanks for your suggestion, I will add a --no-version-check option in 1.8.\n. Thanks!\n. Please paste the full backtrace.\n. Looks like this is a bug that was fixed in a recent requests update and I've updated the build environment to use latest requests now. A new build will be available on http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html when the next commit is pushed.\n. Thanks!\n. You're using an old version, Twitch has made changes since that version was released.\n. Make sure you don't have any old versions lying around since from before. The log messages you posted indicates that it's almost a year old release.\n. I think the problem may be on Twitch's end, their servers are probably overloaded.\nEdit: I also noticed you are in Singapore but Twitch is making you access servers located in San Francisco, so the speedtest is really not a good indicator of anything here as it just tests against a nearby server.\n. > \"livestreamer http://xxx.xxx.xxx/xxx.m3u8\" can't play ,\"livestreamer hls://xxx.xxx.xxx/xxx.m3u8\" can play.Is this normal?\nYes.\n\nthe m3u8 file contain only 1 stream ,the livestream always ask me to choose a stream.Is it necessary?\n\nYes, this is how Livestreamer is designed. I believe it makes most sense to behave the same for every URL or it may confuse the user.\nAs @athoik mentioned the URL here is a variant playlist (a playlist containing other playlists). But you shouldn't have to use these URLs manually as there is already a plugin for GOMeXP, simply enter the URL \"gomexp.com\" and it will find all the streams for you.\n. There was a problem with XML decoding on Python 2, should be fixed with c86d58b8bb13f5e73f7854a663fc347950e2708c. Keep in mind that the plugin uses the same API as the mobile app though, this means that even if the stream is online 24/7 it will only return streams if there is an event live in the app.\n. --retry-streams will attempt to fetch the streams every X seconds until it has found some.\n--retry-open is for controlling how many times it will try to open a stream once it's been found, this is useful if your connection times out to a stream sometimes and want to retry immediately instead of restarting the program\n. > This will not occur after a \"[cli][info] Stream ended\" will it? I just want to make sure I understand when this occurs.\nNo, this only affects the initial opening of the stream.\n. Hello, I've found a few issues with your plugin:\n- You are importing unquote but it is not used.\n- The urlget function is now deprecated, please use the new API, e.g. \npython\nfrom livestreamer.plugin.api import http\nres = http.get(url)\n- You can remove all the playlist parsing code and use return HLSStream.parse_variant_playlist(self.session, url) instead.\n. Please squash your commits into one (git rebase -i HEAD~2, select fixup on the second commit, then git push --force)\n. Thanks!\n. > not trying to open this sorry but tried with your latest version and get no such plugin error\nIt is not available in the release, you must install the latest git version.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here, what version of python-requests do you have?\n. Actually, when using requests < 2.0 I also got the timeout. So try updating your requests.\n. It's possible to point Livestreamer to a stream URL, see Playing built-in streaming protocols directly.\n. That is intended, seeking is not supported.\n. Thanks!\n. This is not something Livestreamer has direct control over, you'll need to look up if your player has a option to do this.\n. Looks good, but a couple of improvements can be made:\n- There is no need for a separate requests session, http is already a session.\n- Use the http.json(res) method instead of json.loads.\n- Move the URLs to constant variables instead.\n- The help message for the new options could be more descriptive.\n- Add the new options to docs/cli.rst.\n. Looks good, thanks for your contribution!\n. Does this happen on every channel? Also, are you using any extra codec packs or just vanilla MPC-HC?\n. For some reason I just assumed you were using a Twitch channel, but are you perhaps trying to use UStream channels? If so, please try the latest git version, there have been many improvements to this troublesome streaming platform since 1.7.5.\n. It looks like these streams are doing some non-standard muxing which is causing players to freak out. ffmpeg based players such as VLC or mpv is able to play the streams though, after printing some errors.\n. Please try the latest git version.\n. I do not want to change the default behaviour of this, but will consider adding a option.\n. The behaviour has not changed and you need to enable this option yourself. But yes, it will print a list of available streams before starting the stream.\n. As I said it is an option, it is not enabled by default. Nothing will change if you do not want this behaviour.\n. Duplicate of #347.\n. Looks good except for a couple of minor issues:\n- Use parse_qsd from livestreamer.utils instead of parse_qs, it returns a flat dict instead of a dict containing lists.\n- Import urlparse from livestreamer.compat instead, it has different package locations on Python 2 and 3.\n- I don't like this hardcoded RTMP URL, is this really how the original player behaves?\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Verify that you are actually running 1.7.5 with livestreamer --version. It's possible you have an older version installed taking precedence.\n. Search you harddrives for any livestreamer.exe's and remove any that doesn't belong to the installation directory created by the installer. It's possible you have installed something that bundles Livestreamer.\n. VLC does not run as root.\n. Does running python /usr/local/bin/livestreamer work?\n. Looks like you don't have permission to read the file, does running chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/livestreamer help?\n. Sorry, I meant sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/livestreamer.\n. That means the command was successful, did it not help?\n. Yes, that's because you're missing /usr/local/bin in your $PATH it seems. Does python /usr/local/bin/livestreamer still give permission denied?\n. That's odd, I'm not very knowledgeable about OS X, but I guess it's possible something went wrong with the install. Since OS X comes with easy_install installed by default this should be the simplet way to install Livestreamer:\nsudo easy_install livestreamer`\nIf that doesn't work, try installing with pip (another package manager for Python):\nsudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade livestreamer\n. I guess you could try installing with pip's user mode instead, it should be impossible to run into permission issues then:\nsudo easy_install pip # install pip\nsudo pip uninstall livestreamer # uninstall the globally installed livestreamer first\npip install --user livestreamer\nSomewhere in the output it should say something like Installing livestreamer script to <path>. Copy that directory path and then then run livestreamer with:\npython <path>/livestreamer\n. Ah, right, you'll need to use /usr/local/bin/pip for the pip commands.\n. There seems to something on your system preventing users to access files in /usr/local/bin properly. I'm not very familiar with OS X, but is it possible you have some special security features enabled?\nThe last idea I have is to simply reinstall Python via homebrew, see this guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/ and then reinstalling Livestreamer.\nIf that doesn't help you I'm afraid I can't help you any further.\n. This might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4495120/combine-user-with-prefix-error-with-setup-py-install\n. Please try the latest git version.\n. The link I mentioned will take you to prebuilt Windows binaries. Though they do not include rtmpdump but unless you've uninstalled the installer version livestreamer will still use that rtmpdump.\n. This means there is a connection issue between you and Twitch's servers. It can be a issue with your ISP, somewhere inbetween or the Twitch servers. There's not really anything you can do about it except trying a different quality or a proxy/VPN.\n. I don't think that's currently possible, according to the API docs it's only possible via Android/iOS/Chrome right now. Livestreamer is written in Python so we'd need a Python API first.\n. Thanks!\n. Does this happen other channels aswell?\n. Does it work in your browser?\n. Do you have something in your network setup that might interfere, such as firewalls or proxies? You can try using --http-ignore-env to make sure no proxy settings are picked up by accident.\nIt might be useful to compare the network traffic between your browser and livestreamer. If you could upload two dumps, one where you attempt to play the stream via livestreamer and another where it is playing in your browser it might be possible to find out any possible differences. \nYou can use Wireshark to capture your network traffic.\n. I think it's starting to sound like you have some issues with your WiFi, the errors you describe (except the looping video, that one is weird) can occur if there is packet loss or very low bandwidth available.\nIf you run livestreamer with debug output enabled (livestreamer --loglevel debug) it might give some more clues.\n. Try sudo pip install --force-reinstall --upgrade livestreamer.\n. This is very strange. Nothing is decrypted until the segment has been fully downloaded so partial segments should not be possible. I've pushed a workaround that in case we get a segment that is not correct size we cut it down to the nearest multiple of 16.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I actually wrote a plugin for these sites a while ago but forgot to commit, enjoy. :-)\n. Duplicate of #373.\n. Thanks for your effort but this is not a proper fix. The user should not have to guess if a stream is video only. I've pushed a proper fix that analyzes the first FLV tags to see if we only have audio or video tags instead.\n. > Getting rid of all other mechanisms and just providing it as a command line flag is nice.\n\nI'm not really sure about the pseudo-interactive nature of livestreamer, having to query a stream just to query it again with a chosen quality set seems very awkward.\n\nYeah, I agree. Adding --best-stream-default was probably a mistake, it should have been something like --default-stream <streams> instead.\n\nI'm not really sure about the pseudo-interactive nature of livestreamer, having to query a stream just to query it again with a chosen quality set seems very awkward.\n\nThis idea of querying the streams and then choosing stream exists mainly because in the early versions we didn't have any way of ranking the streams internally and the user had to make a choice of the available streams instead of relying on best/worst.\nI'm thinking in 2.0 (I don't want to make a major change like this before that) we will just default to starting best and then the user can override it with either adding the stream as last argument or setting it via a config option.\nIn 1.9 though, I will probably deprecate --best-stream-default and replace it with a option to set a list of default streams as suggested.\n. Is this gray screen permanent or does it just show up temporarily? What channel/url are you watching? Have you tried a different player?\n. I think what's happening is that your stream is falling slowly behind and eventually gets to a point where the data is no longer available from Twitch's servers which can cause the glitches you describe. This is usually caused by Twitch's servers being overloaded and all you can do is restart the stream and hope it doesn't happen again.\n. As mentioned in #456, we now have multi-threaded streaming, please try it out. Post any feedback there instead and I'll close this.\n. Please paste your full livestreamerrc.\n. I don't know how they got there but there seems to be 4 invalid characters (and invisible in notepad) on the first line of your livestreamerrc. Try removing the whole first line and see if it helps.\n. How did you install livestreamer?\n. Try reinstalling with pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall requests livestreamer.\n. Hmm, try easy_install --upgrade requests.\n. I don't think this really belongs in Livestreamer as I want to keep the CLI as simple as possible. You can probably do this by telling VLC to act as a streaming server instead.\n. > Nevethless, given the kind of error, I'm betting it's because of the string on this line not having the unicode prefix.\nI'm not so sure about that theory, it would only be the case if there was a error and it also contains unicode characters.\nUnfortunately the full traceback was lost when the error was wrapped in a PluginError. If you could temporarily remove these lines (213-214) from src/livestreamer/plugin/plugin.py:\n``` python\nexcept (IOError, OSError, ValueError) as err:\n    raise PluginError(err)\n```\nYou should get the full traceback so we can figure out exactly where the error occured.\n. Thanks for investigating, it does indeed look like Crunchyroll may send localized error strings.\n. Since I merged #388 you should now get a proper error message instead of that Python error. \nHowever, as @asermax mentioned in https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/364#issuecomment-43391012 it seems Crunchyroll wants to serve you localized subtitles but they don't exist for these series you're having trouble with and you get an error.\n. I think we want to avoid using the u'' prefix since it does not exist on Python 3.2. Instead we should add from __future__ import unicode_literals to the affected files. This will turn the strings into unicode on Python 2 just like they already are on Python 3.\n. Thanks!\n. Is this the same issue as #253?\n. I think you're looking for http://mpc-hc.org/contact-us/.\n. As described here you can pass stream specific parameters in the URL. In this case it would be: livestreamer \"<url> pvswf=<swf url>\".\n. Thanks for your patch, I've merged it. The reason we had multiple checks was to support the old azubu.tv site, but since that now forwards to the beta site it's no longer needed.\n. > Is it the one that is available here? http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds.html\nYes, that is correct.\n. Hmm, I'm thinking this may be related to the wheel package I added in 1.8.1 but I was not able reproduce this on Python 2.6.8 myself.\nI've removed the wheel package for now though as I also noticed it will not handle dependencies that are only needed on specific Python versions (argparse is needed on 2.6).\n. A couple of things that might be helpful:\n- Put print(path) on line 33 of livestreamer/plugin/api/__init__.py to print the path we try to load support plugins from\n- Check that justintv_common.py was correctly installed into that path.\nThe fact it just happened now seems to indicate that there might be some issue with wheel packages on that specific 2.6 version as the code to load support plugins hasn't been touched for quite while and I just added the wheel package in 1.8.1. I will compile the specific Python version to see if I can reproduce it myself later.\nEdit: Also, what pip version are you using?\n. This is not possible unfortunately. Livestreamer is only able to feed data to the player in one direction, we have no way of knowing if the player wants to seek. Closest you're gonna get is to add \"?t=00h00m\" to the URL to select a starting point in the VOD.\n. There was a bunch of workarounds proposed in #355, none of them helped you either?\n. A couple of minor issues I found and made inline comments for, other than that it look good. :thumbsup:\n. Thanks!\n. Make sure you have python-librtmp installed to get all the streams.\n. This is the result I get: https://gist.github.com/chrippa/dfbaad88ee3004498293\nWhat are you getting?\n. You can enable some debug output like this: https://gist.github.com/chrippa/dd2c5f7c14d243742bb4\n. When you use -o file it will not use the player and just write to the file directly. There is a couple of options to achieve what you want:\n- Use timeout from GNU coreutils to stop execution after some time, e.g. timeout 3h livestreamer -o file url best\n- Use ffmpeg as the player, e.g. livestreamer --player-no-close --player-verbose --player ffmpeg --player-args \"-i {filename} <your ffmpeg options>\" url best\n. Whups, I meant --verbose-player. ;-)\nAbout the vlc attempt, the -i {filename} was actually meant specifically for ffmpeg, it is expanded to -i - since {filename} is replaced with a input filename to the player, stdin in this case which is represented by the dash (-).\nI don't know the command option to make vlc write to a file but this should work:\nlivestreamer --player-no-close --player vlc --player-args \"--option-that-tells-vlc-to-write-to-file output_file1 --stop-time 10 {filename}\" ustream.tv/channel/hakatastation-now best\nHere is a full example for ffmpeg that works for me:\nlivestreamer --player-no-close --player ffmpeg --player-args \"-i {filename} -t 10 output.flv\" ustream.tv/channel/hakatastation-now best\n. It seems like when a live stream ends it won't shut down the connection and we are left hanging until timeout. This might end up causing the player to be unresponsive as it's expecting data but is getting none.\nI don't think there is a proper fix for this as it is expected to be the server who drops the connection, you can however lower the HTTP timeout with --http-timeout to force Livestreamer to end the connection faster when it has not received data for a while.\n. Thanks!\n. It will be included in 1.9.0. Probably released sometime after the FIFA World Cup is over. :-)\n. The command window staying open is actually the indended behaviour (the fact that it's visible and not in the background when starting from somewhere other than the command prompt is a Windows thing and not something we can change) since the livestreamer process will remain as long as the player is still open.\nI believe what is happening is that the player process that livestreamer starts is closed immediately since it has detected an existing MPC-HC session and just forwards the URL to it. This will also cause livestreamer to exit since the process it started no longer exists.\nI assume you also use --player-passthrough? Since that will tell the player to do the transport if it supports the protocol, otherwise it would not work at all since livestreamer has exited.\nI will consider changing the behaviour when using --player-passthrough to simply launch the player process in the background and then exit. The reason it's they way it is now is to keep it consistent across all player modes, but I did not consider Window's forced command prompt window when originally implementing this.\n. The channel mentioned has been closed. From the Twitch page: \"The community has closed this channel due to terms of service violations\".\n. Thanks!\n. Either add the path to mplayer to your PATH environment variable or specify the full path to mplayer.exe, e.g.\n--player \"C:\\mplayer\\mplayer.exe\"\n--player \"'C:\\path with spaces\\mplayer.exe'\"\n. This is beyond the scope of this project, feel free to use the API to make it yourself.\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Make sure you are using the latest Livestreamer and that the channel is broadcasting.\n. What does livestreamer --version say?\n. That's odd, the stream mentioned works fine here. Does it work in your browser?\n. Nothing special, just livestreamer mlg.tv/spacely. \n. Here's a few more things you can do to help me figure this out:\n1. Check that you don't have a sideloaded MLG plugin you've forgotten about.\n2. Install the latest development version and check if that helps.\n3. Put this plugin which has extra debug prints in ~/.config/livestreamer/plugins and paste the output.\n. Thanks!\n. I've pushed a fix so it now handles these types of URLs aswell.\n. Should be all good now, before I was kind of guessing how the URLs could be structured, but now it seems clear it's the last part of the URL that is important and the parts before it are optional and can be zero or more.\n. By error do you mean in VLC or from livestreamer? The warnings in the log looks mostly harmless (might only cause some delays).\nYou might want to pass the option -o filename.flv to livestreamer instead of recording with VLC though.\n. Yes, that is correct, you don't need \"--player-no-close\" though.\n. Yes, example: livestreamer http://www.ustream.tv/creativelive best -o \"E:\\Online Cources\\AAA NEW\\New.flv\"\n. The errors here looks non-fatal (each chunk gets 3 attempts to be downloaded) and it looks like it ends naturally. There is however some odd issues with the ustream streams once in a while and it seems to affect these creativelive streams in particular. \nI'm closing this to keep all ustream issues in #265, I'll post any updates there if I change something that might make the ustream streams more stable.\n. This is not the issue tracker for the livestreamersrv project.\nIf you believe this is a bug in the livestreamer library please run the CLI with debug enabled (--loglevel debug) and paste the output.\n. Thanks!\n. How did you install it? You can't use the prebuilt Windows version as a library, you need to install it with pip or easy_install.\n. I'm not sure why it would get interpreted as a URL, but looking at --\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfbest-stream-default it seems you have some odd characters in your livestreamerrc. It's possible your text editor is hiding them from you for some reason so you might need to use another one to find and remove them.\n. Ah, I see, well argparse is responsible for opening and reading the file and only feeds us lines that we parse into arguments. I guess the solution is to strip non-ascii characters from the option name.\n. Thanks!\n. This is very strange, but it sounds more like it might be a issue with the video player you're using (VLC?). Try changing player and see if it helps.\n. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #358.\n. On what URL is this happening?\n. It looks like these videos only has 480p available via MPEG-DASH streaming, which we do not currently have support for. It's a fairly complex streaming protocol and I can't give you an answer if or when it might be supported unfortunately.\n. Closing this since it seem to be the same issue as #223.\n. You won't be able to play the SWF in livestreamer. You can usually use wireshark to sniff your network traffic to figure out the actual stream used and if it's supported by livestreamer, play it.\nIn this case though, it looks like this player is using it's own streaming protocol which we do not support. So you would have to analyze the traffic to figure out how it works exactly and then write an implementation in a plugin.\n. MPlayer has unfortunately kind of bitrotten by now and instead using the fork mpv is recommended.\nAs for your VLC issue, I'm not a OS X guy, but it's been reported that using the 32-bit version of VLC works when the 64-bit does not. You can also try using --player-http to make use of HTTP as the transport instead of pipes.\n. Does installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package help?\n. This can usually be done via the shell. This is a example using bash:\nlivestreamer -o \"quakecon-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).ts\" twitch.tv/quakecon best\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Are you using any non-ascii characters in your username/password that could possibly trip up the parsing?\n. Thanks!\n. The channel does not seem to exist anymore, from the site: \"The channel could not be found, or has been deleted by its owner.\".\n. I just tried twitch.tv/dota2ti_pod_2 and it works for me.\nSometimes when Twitch is under heavy load it may not return any streams but retrying usually works, is it possible that this is what happened to you?\n. It looks like Quick Time may not accept data via the stdin pipe.\nI've added a player page to collect some compatibility information. Please try out all the transport modes listed there and report back so it can be updated.\n. The --player option is parsed with a shell-like syntax. This is to be able to support stuff like --player \"vlc --my-args\". Unfortunately it's not quite perfect, as escaping spaces with back-slashes does not work and quotes have to be used instead.\nThis should work: --player \"'/Applications/QuickTime Player.app/Contents/MacOS/QuickTime Player'\"\nEdit: Improved the parsing slightly with b01e79639099809af46a8b2b8e988509bad89713.\n. From your error messages it seems like Quick Time will only accept actual files, so it's unlikely it will ever work with Livestreamer unfortunately.\nThe reason you got a different error when using open is because it launches the app in the background and then exits but Livestreamer requires the player process it launches to stick around so it can exit properly when the player is closed.\n. Looks like there might be a firewall blocking or an invalid proxy set.\n. This is interesting, but I noticed a few issues:\n- Not all data is written to output at the end and sometimes segments are missing alltogether. This is easily tested with a non-live HLS video such as this. Make sure it always produces a file with the same checksum when running with and without your changes.\n- Putting the \"hls-download-threads\" option in segmented.py is wrong, as enabling this breaks other stream types that require processing segments in correct order (HDS, UStream). You should instead make it an argument to the class like \"hls-timeout\" does it.\n. After thinking a bit about this I've decided that using the RingBuffer to do this is not the best approach to solve this problem.\nInstead splitting the fetching part from .write() into a .fetch() method and using concurrent.futures is the way to go I think. I've started working on a implementation and hope to push it soon.\nThanks for your effort though.\n. I pushed my version yesterday so it's available if you want to try it out. :)\n. > Tested. Works well with my bw caps for anything <=720p and futures do quite simplify the sorting I had to hack up, but when the segments become bigger, the wait for the threads to finish before giving back data causes \"stream timeouts\" (not segments).\n\nIt's just a nitpick.\nMy implementation gives back data as soon as 3 segments have completed (regardless of the number of threads, I run with 6, 2 per ISP), it fails when the 3 segments aren't the \"first\" 3 segments (which is, I believe, one of the errors you spotted) so the stream doesn't timeout (that often) with higher bandwidth streams, only segments do (and get retried, and things blow up when a \"very old\" segment gets added to the buffer, I missed some logic to discard them when newer segments were already delivered).\n\nIf you're running into timeouts you can try tweaking them with the --hls-segment-timeout and --hls-timeout options. You can also change how many attempts are made to fetch a segment before skipping it with --hls-segment-attempts.\n\nAnother detail, the player I use is mpv and I set it up with a commandline with a cache of 8Mb, it starts playing after filling 90% of the cache, then pauses at 20% cache and doesn't resume until 50%, that setup gives the parallel-download time to catch up when there are segment-retries/timeouts but also causes the startup to wait quite a long time, at least a whole playlist is usually already downloaded before video starts, waiting on all 6 segments (threads) of the first HLS playlist pretty much doubles that wait time.\n\nEven though it may seem like it sometimes, it's actually not waiting for all threads to complete a segment, but it does process each segment in ordered fashion so it must wait for at least the first segment to be completed before any data is written.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Perhaps trying an alternative server (using a stream named <quality>_alt_<server>) will help?\n. I had the stream open for a few minutes and there was no stuttering or errors. What I meant was instead of typing best, type one of the alternative streams listed in the output from livestreamer. Enabling some caching will probably help but otherwise pausing the stream for a few seconds to let it buffer can also work.\n. Thanks!\n. Well, the UStream streaming protocol is similar to HLS (that YouTube uses) in that they are both segmented streaming types. But the main difference is that on UStream information about next available segment arrives less reliably. This can cause inconsistent throughput, especially in the start of the playback.\nI don't know if omxplayer has an option for this, but enabling some caching is likely to help. If that is not possible you can always use one of the streams prefixed mobile_, these are HLS and should work more reliably at the cost of slightly lower quality.\n. There is nothing artifically slowing the download speed in Livestreamer. If it is not enough there is nothing that be done except lowering the quality.\n. I've just added support for multi-threaded streaming which might help a bit. Try using it with --hls-segment-threads <threads>.\nIf you're on Windows you can find a build here.\n. In 1.8.2 beta.twitch.tv was actually broken and was using the regular site no matter what which explains why you see this error just now. The error seems to be caused by poor SSL support in Python 2, since it works fine on Python 3.\n. You'll need to install Python 3 and install Livestreamer from source.\nOther than updating the Windows build to use Python 3 (which I don't have any plans on doing right now as it's alot of work) I don't think this can be solved in Livestreamer.\n. OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/livestreamer-1.8.2-py2.7.egg/livestreamer_cli/constants.py'\nThis means you did not have permission to install livestreamer, use sudo pip install livestreamer.\nPS. When you see a # instead of $ on a command-line example it usually represents root permissions are required.\n. It's probably possible, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.\nFirst of all, the experience would not be perfect, for example, if the host switches channel we would not know and still be on the initial channel set when we start.\nSecond, the whole idea of host mode seems to be to keeping a chat community together while watching another channel but since we don't do chat I don't really see the point when you can just launch the other channel directly and chat in a IRC client.\n. It might be possible but I don't know how. It's not available in the API we use now and I don't see any references to a .mp4 when accessing the page with a iOS user-agent.\nYou can easily convert the file to desired format with ffmpeg though, e.g.\nffmpeg -i input.ts -c copy output.mp4\n. Even though that URL has \".mp4\" in it, it's the same HLS stream that the plugin currently extracts.\n. The streaming protocol HLS is actually created by Apple, so Safari is one of the few desktop browsers that supports it natively without flash.\nThat error seems to be specifically related to converting .ts files so I don't think there is any error in the stream itself.\nAnyway, since there doesn't seem to be any additional streams to add I'll close this issue.\n. In c389337 I improved the status line a fair bit, but the requested feature to display video time is not there, but instead replaced with the elapsed time. This is because to get the actual video time we would  have to decode the video, which is not something we can nor wish to do.\n. What channel is this happening on?\n. Do you have python-librtmp installed? Without it, the ustream plugin can only access mobile streams, which unfortunately appears to be unavailable right now.\n. Not possible for Twitch, but you can do it with Crunchyroll and other plugins that use a stream protocol that your player supports, see --player-passthrough.\nFor example Crunchyroll uses HLS so you use --player-passthrough hls to let the player do the actual streaming. I know at least mpv and VLC supports seeking in HLS streams.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\nPS. You might want to set your text editor to use Unix line endings instead of DOS ones in the future as I believe 99% open source projects use that. ;-)\n. Thanks!\n. Unfortunately there is no solution to this right now. It looks like Afreeca may stop using these HLS streams as they only seem to be working on some channels now.\n. Please clarify, by \"nothing happens\" do mean absolutely nothing happening in the console or just that there is no playback starting?\nThere have been reports of omxplayer having odd issues. But they might have been fixed by now, so make sure you're using the latest version.\n. Thanks!\n. @nixxquality already contributed a plugin for this site a couple of days ago. You can try it out by installing the latest development version.\n. There is no generic way of doing this in livestreamer, but some services (such as Twitch) has specific streams with audio only.\n. Is this token generated with --twitch-oauth-authenticate or from somewhere else?\nEdit: Also, could you please edit this URL as needed and then access it in your browser and paste the output: https://api.twitch.tv/kraken/user?oauth_token=YOURTOKEN\n. Ah, I see. When a OAuth token is created it is limited to certain scopes, e.g. \"user\" or \"chat\". This is to let the user have control over what an app can do with your account. When we check if the token is valid we request the username from Twitch so we can display it, this requires the \"user\" scope. \nThe problem here is that the token generated on that site only has the \"chat\" scope, so we get an error when we attempt to request the username and assume that the token was invalid. \nIt is generally a bad idea to use a token generated for one app on other apps as they might expect certain permissions, as we do here. I'd suggest you use livestreamer --twitch-oauth-authenticate to generate a token specific for Livestreamer. This will make it less confusing if in the future you wish to revoke Livestreamer's access to your account.\n. Thanks!\n. That URL does not make sense, just use \"http://vaughnlive.tv/univision_hd19\".\n. This has to be a false positive. I cross-compiled the exe in Linux with Mingw myself. If you don't want to trust me, feel free to replace it with a self-compiled version.\n. Also, for verification, the installed rtmpdump exe should have md5 hash: 58908ee066a88f989b5193e47bf7a1ad. If the hash in the log you pasted is the md5 of the exe then it looks like it has been modified somehow.\n. Try starting livestreamer in the command prompt instead and paste the output.\n. The log says it's trying only the Twitch channel, so it looks like your script is not working correctly.\n. Please try running livestreamer --loglevel debug hitbox.tv/foos without your script and paste the output.\n. You're missing rtmpdump, which is required to play the RTMP streams used by Hitbox. It is included in the installer but not the zip version. So either use the installer or download rtmpdump yourself.\n. Make sure you have rtmpdump=C:\\path\\to\\rtmpdump.exe in your config file.\n. Livestreamer itself will never contain a GUI, but you can find a list of alternative interfaces on the wiki.\n. Does using --player-http work?\n. The tv4play plugin will only work with the free live streams (such as \"Nyhetsmorgon\") and videos. The channels and videos you tried requires premium and we do not have a option to authenticate users currently.\n. Thanks!\n. Twitch VODs are split up into 30 min chunks and it looks like when a chunk have been muted by Twitch it does not contain a list of keyframe offsets. We use this list of keyframe offsets to be able to seek directly into a chunk. Without this data the only way to seek is by downloading the chunk up until the correct time, which is horribly inefficient.\nSince the Twitch player has now been changed to use this ineffcient seeking I can't imagine this being anything else than some kind of temporary hack to be able to mute videos in the chunks rather than in their player until they launch their new VOD system.\nSince I expect that the new system will likely use HLS instead of 30min FLV chunks and probably be ready soon I don't think there is much point to implement this slow seeking in Livestreamer as well.\n. This is really strange, normally when there is a timeout from a HTTP request it will raise a IOError and we abort the transfer. It must have locked up somewhere in requests or one of the libraries it's using.\nIs this something that happened more than once? Are you using a proxy or VPN?\n. Hmm, just want to double check, you are using 1.9.0 correct? I fixed a similar issue like this in 1.8.0.\n. The problem is that while the main thread wants to exit, the worker thread is stuck somewhere and will block the program from exiting. Unfortunately these things are very hard to reproduce so we can only guess where the problem is. :-/ Most likely suspect is a socket deciding to block forever for some reason.\n. This was a weird issue. Looks like any broadcast created after Twitch announced their new VOD changes contains an extra Script Data tag that causes my serializer to mess something up (I'll have to figure out why later). Simply ignoring it fixes the issue for now, sorry for the inconvenience.\n. Thanks for letting me know, I've added it to the install page.\n. Since we can't use the URL to automatically find the channel ID you will have to find it manually. This can be done by looking through the HTML, if you search for \"ChannelSelector\" you'll find the IDs. In this case the URL to the second channel using it's ID is http://www.ustream.tv/channel/id/18628454.\n. This is how you download a RTMP stream via Livestreamer:\nlivestreamer -o file.flv rtmp://muenchentv.iptv-playoutcenter.de:1935/muenchentv/muenchentv.stream_1 best\nIt's exactly the same as using rtmpdump directly though.\n. Playing HLS URLs is already supported, e.g. livestreamer hlsvariant://http://muenchentv.iptv-playoutcenter.de:1935/muenchentv/muenchentv.stream_1/playlist.m3u8.\n. What does it say when you click \"See details\"?\nYou can change your player by editing your config, though using Pot Player may not be a good idea as it's compatibility with Livestreamer is rather poor.\n. > Is MPC-HC/MPC-BE a good enough player?\nIt's up to you what you consider a good player, but it will probably work better with Livestreamer than Pot Player.\n. This is a known issue (#346) with MPC-HC, try one of the workarounds listed here.\n. You need to install python-librtmp to access the desktop streams.\nIt's included in the Windows builds though, so I'm not sure why it wouldn't work there, but maybe you installed via source?\n. We use the webbrowser module from the standard library to launch the browser, which should use $BROWSER so I'm not sure why this wouldn't work.\nIf there is a error reported to us we will print the URL in the terminal so you can open it manually, does that happen or does it attempt to open the browser and then nothing happens?\nDoes any of these commands work?\npython -c 'import webbrowser; webbrowser.open_new_tab(\"http://google.com\")'\npython -c 'import webbrowser; webbrowser.open(\"http://google.com\")'\n. Wait, so you're not even getting the \"Attempting to open a browser to let you authenticate Livestreamer with Twitch\" message printed? Is the command you're running livestreamer --twitch-oauth-authenticate (no other arguments should be present)?\n. Which page exactly did you copy them from?\n. Thanks!\n. The same happens when using rtmpdump directly. There is probably some additional security you need to figure out to be able to access these streams correctly.\n. Should be fixed with 7ea16f5e0b3e116a798493a8d3e751e383644791.\n. Yes, just add it like any other options.\n. Try restarting the installer a couple of times, not sure why it would give you problems on that step. If that doesn't work you can use the zip archive instead.\n. The zip archive does not contain an installer, just extract the archive and use it as is.\n. Livestreamer is a command-line utility that should be used from the command prompt, please start with reading the tutorial.\n. Those URLs do not look very stable, they probably expired.\n. Thanks!\n. The installer/binary builds of Livestreamer has not changed in any way for over a year, so it sounds like it's a problem with your system or partition specifically.\n. Use --http-cookies.\n. Perhaps you also need to add some of the headers with --http-headers? These types of URLs expire quickly so I can't help you test it.\n. You must install rtmpdump. For example, via hombrew you do brew install rtmpdump.\n. > I\u2019m opening a new issue rather than writing on any of the old; which is preferable ?\n\nSame question goes for my request for a plugin for [http://www.pluzz.fr/] put on\n\u201cRequest for new plugins #328\u201d. Should I rather open a new ?\n\nYes, opening a new issue for each new bug report/feature request is the way to go.\n. Every channel I've tried works fine here, can you name a specific channel you're having issues with and what error you're getting?\n. > error: The specified stream(s) 'low' could not be found. Available streams: 320p (worst), 480p (best)\nAs this error message says, you're trying to use a stream that does not exist.  The commit that closed this issue changed the stream names to use the pixel height instead since that information is available for the HLS streams.\nThough since then, there was another commit that added support for both HLS and RTMP streams and also changed the names back to \"high\" and \"low\" to be consistent between the stream types. So either download the latest build or use the correct stream name.\n. >  I have 1.10.1 installed, on this cmptr, and a reinstalled 1.10.1 on my raspberry pi, but get the same message\nThis was very recently fixed and has not been put into a release yet. Install the latest development version if you want to use it right now.\n. You can't sideload the latest plugin since it depends on changes to the Livestreamer core. When extracting a nightly build into the existing install make sure you first go into the directory inside the zip and copy those files there without the parent directory, e.g. there should not be a \"livestreamer-v1.10.1-16-gd322d0a\" in the Livestreamer directory.\n. Both those streams work fine for me with or without the \"s\". Please copy+paste the actual error you're getting or it's impossible to help.\n\nWhat would be the correct name for the \u201cYesterday\u201d stream ?\nBy \u201cpixel height\u201d do mean like 480p ? But that is the one that won\u2019t last for more than 5 min.\n\nThe pixel height thing is irrelevant now, I changed it back to the \"low\" and \"high\" names.\n. You mentioned earlier you tried to sideload the plugin, so you probably have a filmon plugin in %APPDATA%\\livestreamer\\plugins, that will override the version shipped with 1.10.2.\n. About the 5 minute limit, there is nothing we can do about this since that is how the webpage works aswell, it's just a preview unless you pay.\nWe currently do not have a simple way to authenticate though, you might be able to copy your cookies from your browser and use them with --http-cookies but I do not have a pay account so I don't know if it will work.\n. I don't really see the benefit of this, the streams should be the same, only supporting HLS makes the plugin simpler and the less we rely on rtmpdump the better. Why do you feel the need for this?\n. Use a shell script like this.\n. Yes, that's what it does, it will rename any existing files it finds so they are not overwritten.\n. I think you can write something called a \"batch script\", but I've never done any of that myself so I'm afraid I can't help you with that.\n. Thanks!\n. Use a URL from the webpage, e.g. livestreamer http://www.rtve.es/noticias/directo-la-1/.\n. Some of the streams seems to be restricted to Spanish IP's, so if X-Forwarded-For does not work then you probably have to use a proxy to access them.\n. If you want to use the playlist URL directly you have to add hls:// infront of it. Though you shouldn't have to, as the whole point of the plugin system is to let you use normal URLs from websites, e.g. http://www.rtve.es/noticias/directo-la-1.\n. Duplicate of #514.\n. > It would be even better if it worked with youtube playlists and not only single videos, but that's just an extra.\nSorry, but this is not likely to happen. Since Livestreamer is made for live streams, it is designed to play one stream only. I think you're probably better off asking the developers of your favorite music player to add support for youtube instead, since that is what they are designed for.\n. Are you talking about what file format is outputted with the -o option? The output format depends on what stream type is used and cannot be changed. For example, HLS is MPEG-TS, HDS and RTMP is FLV and HTTP can be anything but most commonly MP4 or FLV.\n. > oh ok and what about quality settings?\nPlease read the tutorial.\n\nandf how do we know which type each service uses?\n\nThe stream type is visible in the console output when opening a stream, e.g. \"[cli][info] Opening stream: source (hls)\".\n. The file output mode is very basic so that's not possible currently. livedumper is perhaps what you're looking for, it's a interface to livestreamer focused on downloading the stream rather than watching it.\n. > right now it just saves at best possible \"as is\" correct?\nSorry, but I don't quite understand what you're asking.\n. Yes, that's correct.\n. Thanks!\n. Leton.tv should already be supported, is it not working for you?\n. This is a issue with version 2.4.0 of the requests library and a bug fix release will probably be out soon. In the mean time, install version 2.3.0 instead: pip install requests==2.3.0.\n. requests 2.4.1 is now released.\n. I'm not sure what Adobe Access is, but there doesn't seem to be any protection other than requiring a UK IP to access the streams. So yes, it should work fine.\n. What command are you running and what error are you getting?\n. I'm not very familiar with Plex, so I can't answer if it's possible or how complicated it would be to do. But I guess the question is, why would you want to use Livestreamer instead of any of the existing Plex apps?\n. I don't quite get what you're asking, but you can download ffmpeg here.\n. I see... Yes, just use the --player option. For example: livestreamer --player ffplay url best\n. The correct format is ringbuffer-size=50M, don't forget the =.\n. Stdin on livestreamer should be forwarded to the player. The input might be buffered though, and since you're writing only one character you probably have to call popen.stdin.flush() to make sure it gets written immediately or pass bufsize=0 to subprocess.Popen() to disable the buffering.\n. Perhaps this will help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8925903/how-to-fix-getaddrinfo-failure-for-python-on-windows\n. As the answer there suggests, check if you have any invalid proxies set in your Internet Explorer settings.\n. Hmm, not sure, but maybe you can find the same settings in your control panel if you don't have IE.\n. The crash is caused by a bug in requests 2.4.0, upgrading to 2.4.1 will solve that. However, it looks like you also have a connection issue, possibly some firewall or faulty network hardware.\n. > is it possible to get the player to stay open when stream ends?\n\nim using a .bat file and livestreamer wont restart until player closes even when stream ends.\n\nThis is confusing, first you ask if the player can stay open and then you say that it does and you want it to close?\nEither way, if you use the --player-no-close option the player will not be closed when stream ends and if it's not used then the player will be closed when stream ends.\n. I think I understand what you want to do now, you want to re-use the initial player instead of starting a new one for each stream? That's not possible due to the way the communication between Livestreamer and the player is implemented. \n. We currently do not have a simple way to authenticate with ilive. You might be able to use the --http-cookies option with the cookies from your browser but I have not tested this myself since I don't have a premum account.\n. Sounds like you have a firewall or some problem in your network (bad wifi signal perhaps?).\n. Thanks!\n. Works fine here, make sure you're using the latest version (1.10.2). You can check with livestreamer --version.\n. Totally forgot to merge this, but since you made another fix I'll close this one.\n. This is already possible, see --player-continuous-http.\n. > Basically when a stream ends i want the player to close and eventually with it the livestreamer cmd window, but before that livestreamer should just try to open the stream once again for a user specified time frame (like 10minutes) before shutting itself down, in case the stream comes back in that time.\nI'm not fond of the idea of Livestreamer doing too much magic such as launching and closing the player multiple times depending on certain conditions. If you really want this you can write a script that just retries starting Livestreamer according to your specifications.\n\nAs it is now (even with --player-continuous-http) the player just closes at the end of the stream (mpc-hc is set to \"repeat forever\" in playback options) and so does the livestreamer cmd window...\nSo I'm running some excessive tests again right now with the options, but all that http has done for me so far is like 10 times longer start up times of the stream/player\n\nUnfortunately players that use the Windows codecs to access HTTP (such as MPC-HC) has issues with our HTTP modes since for some reason Windows wants to do multiple requests to our server and we don't know which one is the real one so we end up opening the stream for each request which might be slow or end up not working at all. Using VLC or mpv recommended instead since they behave much more sanely and only does one request.\n. > i can't really understand your mindset, since livestreamer closes media players by default anyway and this would be an optional setting (which i think also got requested at other places before, but was then shut down very fast as well).\nI've considered adding such a option in the past but I have always been hesitant since I believe it's a bad user experience. The main reason is that, while it may not be the case if you're using Windows,  it's very common in the Linux world to have multiple virtual desktops and having Livestreamer potentially start another player after the initial start that could pop up on the wrong desktop is what I consider really poor behaviour from an application.\nTherefore I came up with a solution that keeps the existing player going but starts a new stream,  which is --player-continuous-http. I believe it's the best approach to solve the issue. The only downside is that it has problems with MPC-HC but I'm sure that can be solved somehow. Either by improving our HTTP server or changing something in MPC-HC so it avoids relying on the Windows codec's poor behaviour.\n. I'm really not sure this is something Livestreamer should be doing. Keeping the interactions with the environment to a minimum is important to maintain our cross-platform compatibility. You can probably do this with a simple script that gets the clipboard contents and launches Livestreamer.\n. It looks like php is clearing out the environment variables set by Windows. We need access to the variable 'APPDATA' to find the directory containing the config files. \nYou might be able to work around this by setting the variable manually in php. You can see the correct value by typing \"set\" in the command prompt and look for 'APPDATA'. \n. putenv looks like a likely candidate, but I'm not very familiar with PHP APIs.\n. > can this be put in the bat file as well? it just needs the folder where the config file is right?\nFrom my understanding of the error message you gave me it's PHP that is not letting Livestreamer access the environment variables set by Windows not the .bat file. So no, you need to make PHP start Livestreamer with the environment variable intact. \n\nwhat exactly am i supposed to be in this ?? \n\nYou're the PHP programmer, not me... The documentation I linked you gives you all the information you need. It looks like this should work:\nphp\nputenv(\"APPDATA=C:/User/username/Application data\");\nBut replace the path with the correct one from your environment.\n. It's possible rtmpdump also requires an intact environment and crashes because of it.\nI got no clue what that WScript stuff is, but if it's not something you're required to use then you should probably use PHP's builtin way of launching processes instead: shell_exec. It might keep the environment intact.\n. The commands you got working are the ones that do not actually do any streaming. The streams you've tried requires --swfVfy to be passed to rtmpdump, this option makes rtmpdump hash the SWF and then write the value to a cache. It's likely rtmpdump needs access to environment variables to find a good location to write this cache, but since php (or the WScript thing?) is clearing the environment, it will crash.\nYou need to figure out what environment variables are missing or find a way for PHP to not clear the environment.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I managed to run into this aswell, but I'm 100% sure this not a Livestreamer bug but rather something in mpv or the nvidia driver. Because it happens even when launching with mpv <the URL to the playlist>, and no Livestreamer involved at all.\n. I'm not seeing this here, perhaps it was just a temporary server issue?\n. I don't think there's really a reason to use Livestreamer for something like this.\nSince Twitch uses HLS, which is a segmented streaming technology based on HTTP, you can probably just cache the requests similar to how you do steam downloads.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Also, Livestreamer does not do any muxing or messing with the data at all, it's just a simple transfer from the server so if there is an issue with timestamps it's originating from the server.\n. Huh? There is no stream on the front page, so what would it open?\n. I see, I thought you meant using only the domain name as the URL passed to Livestreamer. df62756ceb7878d53e55ca429ca0db2a4c188969 adds support for the ilive.to domain.\n. You're attempting to play a URL that is a kind of catalog for multiple streams, try using a URL pointing directly to a stream instead, e.g. http://www.viagame.com/channels/viagame-house-cup/439013.\n. See #564. I will look into making the plugin handle channel pages aswell.\n. Documenting the escaping vadmium mentions is probably the way to go.\n--player-args is really intended for use where you must change the order of arguments and using --player (which does not use any formatting args) should generally be enough for most users.\n. It sounds like a issue with VLC indeed, have you tried not using vaapi?\nYou probably want to report this to the VLC project instead.\n. A option like this requires us to collect and expose metadata about the streams. Metadata collection is planned for 2.0 and I will consider adding such a option then.\n. According to this reddit thread it might help to run ipconfig /flushdns.\nIf that doesn't help you might want to check if you have a firewall blocking Livestreamer.\n. Livestreamer has a library API available that you can use to create an android app. But keep in mind that Livestreamer is written in Python so it's not painless to integrate into an Android app, though the Kivy framework might help with that.\nSo while it's possible, providing such an app is far beyond the scope of this project.\n. No update I'm afraid. If you wish things to move faster feel free to submit a patch as a pull request.\n. Are you using --player-continuous-http? That's the only thing I can think of that can possibly cause looping.\n. Do you have \"Auto re-connect\" or \"Continuous stream\" enabled under VLC Settings -> Input / Codecs -> Access modules -> HTTP(S)? Those options might interfere.\n. Could this be the same bug as #253? Try changing audio output to ALSA instead of Pulseaudio.\n. See configuration file.\n. You need to write a plain text file, not a document.\n. You're using a long style dash, use two normal ones instead.\n. You can probably do this by piping into netcat instead, e.g.\nlivestreamer -O url best | netcat -u localhost 5555\n. Do you have an example URL?\n. Looks like this is the same issue as #223. Some qualities are only available via MPEG-DASH which we can't handle currently.\n. Please create a separate issue for each problem and put some more effort into describing the issues (e.g. what URL it occurs on and what error you are getting).\n. Livestreamer can't magically figure out what stream you want to access on sites it doesn't know about, there needs to be a plugin written for the service before it can work.\n. Is this a video or live stream?\n. Hmm, do you have a very large cache set? The only way I can see this happening is if the stream has been fully read from Livestreamer but not played yet. By default Livestreamer will close the player when it has no more data to give to the player. You can try disabling this behaviour with --player-no-close.\n. Hmm, if --player-no-close didn't help then it can't be cache related. What happens if you download the video to a file (-o filename.flv) and then play it?\n. It looks like the file downloads completely but your player is failing play the whole video. What version of VLC are you using?\n. Thanks!\n. I'm afraid you'll have more luck asking Google than here.\n. The wiki is editable by anyone so feel free to add it yourself. :-)\n. Indeed, as mentioned in the issue @VackerSimon referenced, it's not possible until we support MPEG-DASH. We'll use #223 to track the issue.\n. Looks like the mobile streams have moved or been disabled. You can install python-librtmp to gain access to the desktop streams though.\n. It looks like the mobile streams have returned, so UStream is once again usable without python-librtmp installed.\n. Please run with -v --loglevel debug and paste the output.\n. Make sure you have the latest version of omxplayer. It has been reported in the past to have bugs preventing normal playback but they might be fixed.\n. The Livestream.com streams are known to be badly encoded so it's possible omxplayer can't handle them. I suggest you try another player.\n. I'd recommend mpv if it's available for Raspberry Pi, otherwise VLC.\n. I'm not sure what text you're referring to, but if there is a option to change this in VLC you can pass that option using the --player option in Livestreamer.\n. It should not be part of the library core no, but it would be OK in the CLI. But maybe not exactly as described here though. Maybe something like --alias myfavstream twitch.tv/cosmowright which translates to this in the config:\nalias=myfavstream twitch.tv/cosmowright\nalias=myotherfavstream twitch.tv/zfg1\nThe CLI then just needs to check if there is an alias passed and if so use the URL it points to instead.\n. Thanks!\n. Docopt is great for small and simple programs but it's not a good fit for Livestreamer.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Not possible until requests/urllib3 has support. See shazow/urllib3#284 for the current progress.\n. See http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/api_guide.html.\n. Did you name your script or have a file named \"livestreamer.py\" in the same directory? That would cause a conflict.\n. Twitch uses a streaming protocol called HLS, which instead of continuously streaming splits the video into smaller segments, which is why you see spikes like this. You can probably use some software to limit the max speed of Livestreamer, and as long as you don't put the limit below the bitrate of the stream it should be a little less spiky but may increase the chance of buffering.\n. Should be fixed by #722.\n. Please read the tutorial. You need to specify a quality to play.\n. Not able to reproduce this here, both HLS and RTMP are available for me.\n. Thanks!\n. Sounds like the issue is at the source, you can use the Twitch Analyzer to check if that's the case.\n. That's odd, but by using the --player-passthrough option Livestreamer is essentialy out of the picture after it has started the player. So the issue must be somewhere in your player, perhaps hardware decoding is causing issues?\n. Transcodes are not always available on Twitch, it depends on if there is capacity available and if the channel is partnered.\n. Hmm, should probably change this (and --http-cookies, --http-query-params) into repeatable options that take a key and value argument instead. Should make it simpler to use and get rid of this bug aswell.\n. No, it's not really possible with current desgin of Livestreamer. We don't know what type of HLS playlist it is until we have attempted to open the stream, at which point it's too late to return new streams.\n. The plugin was updated a while ago to support streamlive.to URLs, make sure you're using a recent git version of Livestreamer.\n. This is pretty strange, what about other programs that have added themself to your path, do they work?\n. Looks like your connection to Twitch is too slow, causing you to fall behind on downloading segments, eventually reaching a point where the segments are no longer available.\nIn some cases it can be your ISP limiting each individual connection, in which case the --hls-segment-threads option might help, since it will open multiple connections.\n. > btw, is there not a option the set the queue size?change this line might help?\nSince we added parallel downloads it's now possible to fill the queue if all threads are downloading, I've raised the limit to 20 in f4c083b2a836d8cc2cd73a9036c5d89f868c32b9.\n. > When a thread fetch a segment failed,it will wait a long time.Is this a bug?\nBy default a segment won't be skipped until 3 attempts to download it have been made, you can use the --hls-segment-attempts option to change this.\n. No, I think this is normal. It's just that the debug message is a little bit misleading, \"Download of segment XXX complete\" actually means \"Download of segment XXX complete AND has been written to the buffer\".\nWhat is happening here is that we must wait to write each segment to the buffer in the correct order to avoid playing the segments in the wrong order. If the first segment in the queue is downloaded slower than the ones after, it will look like they finish at the same time since we must process them in order.\n\nthe time exceed the timeout option.\n\nThe timeout may not mean exactly what you think, here is a quote from the requests documentation:\n\ntimeout is not a time limit on the entire response download; rather, an exception is raised if the server has not issued a response for timeout seconds (more precisely, if no bytes have been received on the underlying socket for timeout seconds).\n. I don't think making the timeout apply to the whole response download will help and will only introduce more issues. For example, if a segment has reached 90% completion, but the timeout is reached then we would have to start downloading that segment again which would probably only slow things down more.\n\nThe reality is that Afreeca does not have very good bandwidth to countries outside South Korea and I don't think we can overcome this entirely through software.\n. Livestreamer simply does the transport and does not attempt to encode or mux the resulting file. HLS streams are using the MPEG-TS container (.ts) but you can use a tool such as ffmpeg to remux or encode the file into any format you wish.\n. Thanks!\n. That video is using the new VOD backend, which I added support for yesterday. Try the nightly build if you want to try it out.\n. It doesn't work on their site so I didn't bother adding it. However, since they are now using HLS, you can use --player-passthrough hls to forward the stream URL to the player which makes it possible to jump around in the player (if the player is capable of it).\n. I've pushed a v1.11.1 release. For future reference, you can always find links and instructions on how to install the development build on the Livestreamer webpage.\n. I get no output with the -Q option, do you have an example output?\n. Make sure you have 1.11.1 (check with livestreamer --version).\nThe current Windows installer is a bit bad and if you have installed Livestreamer into different locations without uninstalling them first you might be running the older version. Finding any old versions installed and removing them should fix the issue.\n. > I have, it still remains 1.10.2., I think it's the highest available version for OS X. \n1.11.1 is available for OS X. easy_install -U livestreamer should upgrade it for you.\nIf that doesn't help, try running pip uninstall livestreamer first.\n. Make sure you have 1.11.1 (check with livestreamer --version) and that you have not sideloaded a broken plugin.\nThe current Windows installer is a bit bad and if you have installed Livestreamer into different locations without uninstalling them first you might be running the older version. Finding any old versions installed and removing them should fix the issue.\n. You need to upgrade to 1.11.1.\n. You have put invalid options in your config.\n. Please upload you config.\n. Add a # in front of the line that only has \" VLC\". Without the # it is regarded as a option.\n. Are you using 1.11.1?\n. Are you using rtmpdump-ksv?\n. This is intended, currently it works like this:\n- Logging and exit message goes on stdout unless the -O/--stdout option is used in which case it will be on stderr.\n- File output status and questions waiting for user input are always on stderr.\nSince the file output status continously update it doesn't make sense to write it to stdout since it may be piped to a file rather than a terminal.\n. Duplicate of #626.\n. From googling it looks like this error is from apt-get. I think the only .deb repository that currently has 1.11.1 is Debian Sid. Make sure you're using that or install via pip instead.\n. If you have previously installed via pip or from a source tree, yes.\n. Thank you for your contribution. However, this is only working around the real issue.\nLivestreamer will attempt to resolve HTTP redirects if no plugin matches the URL. Since the URL's you mention redirect to a normal URL we should not be attempting to handle them, but the current regex is too greedy and matches URL's it can't handle.\n29ddccc4a518677c4467d5de5a7c16f4bbe9d6bd tweaks the regex so we rely on the redirect resolver instead.\n. Previously it tried to avoid refetching the streams by attempting to restart the existing stream until a error occurred. This however didn't work well with HLS and HDS streams and instead caused it to repeat the end of the stream until a error occurred. This change simply changed it to always refetch the streams to avoid that issue.\n. That's interesting, Livestreamer doesn't use anything but the standard Python library so I'm not sure why it would have a problem. It could be that it doesn't like the standalone binary, so if you install Python and then install Livestreamer from source instead I doubt it would react.\n. Only initial seeking via the t parameter is available on the videos using the old video backend.\nOn videos using the new video backend (has /v/ in the URL), you can use --player-passthrough=hls to let the player do the transport instead, which in turn lets you jump around in the video if the player supports it.\n. Works fine here, perhaps it was just a temporary server overload?\n. I'm not very familiar with Ubuntu, but it seems to be available in Ubuntu Vivid. So either use that or install from source after removing the existing package.\n. Make sure you're using 1.11.1.\n. Looks like a bug in urllib3. Though I think it should only happen when requests (which is bundling urllib3) is installed with pip install requests[security], is this what you did?\n. There shouldn't be any difference for streaming from Livestreamer and from files, at least via command line. You just have to pass the correct arguments to VLC via --player or --player-args (if you need to use special order on arguments).\n. Try --http-ignore-env.\n. Works fine here, make sure you're not using a old version of Livestreamer.\n. Hmm, perhaps you have a firewall or proxy that might interfere?\n. Thanks!\n. Are you guys using proxies? I think it may be same issue as #653.\nIt looks like Crunchyroll may have started to use some anti-proxy measures.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Resolved by bbafd228549103ef194bff9daa8a1d8f3c4e6124.\n.

It didn't say so in the article, but you probably need to reboot aswell.\n. Works fine here.\n. > So how did your link/ path look ?\nNothing special, just added hls:// infront of the URL you posted. You may want to try another player, it worked fine with mpv for me at least.\n. Thanks!\n. Closing as #698 added support for this.\n. Using Python 3 is preferred since it may have more security fixes and updates (especially in regards to SSL) than Python 2, but there is no differences feature-wise.\n. There are a couple of options:\n- You can use process pipes via --stdout.\n- Get the URL of the stream via --stream-url or --json, though it will only work with streams that VLC can play directly.\n- And if you want to try something crazy you can use the Python C API to let you talk directly to Livestreamer's Python API.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. > Is it in the pipeline to add support for such subtitles?\nTV4 Play uses HDS streams which are output as FLV files. FLV does not have support for subtitles, so it's not possible for us to mux them together.\n\nI'm at it, I was also wondering: is support/plugins for Kanal 9 and Kanal 5 planned?\n\nNo, but feel free to contribute!\n. Please try the nightly/git version, this is probably the same issue that #686 fixed.\n. This is probably the same issue as #232, try using this script to repair your files.\n. Does passing --crunchyroll-purge-credentials help?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. > Cool, did you get to test it on Windows and/or OS X?\nNo, I don't have access to any machines with those OSes currently. But the socket API should work fine on those OSes.\n\nIt seems I broke player-continuous-http, I'll push a new commit fixing it (sorry!).\n\nNo problem, I've already got a fix in my local repo that i'll push in a minute.\n. Try one of the workarounds listed here. If that doesn't help, try another player.\n. Thanks!\n. To display the ads Flash must be used and the whole reason Livestreamer exists in the first place is to avoid having Flash installed at all, so no, it's not possible. If you want to support streamers use the flash player or donate directly.\n. mplayer is pretty outdated and should probably be avoided at this point, try the fork mpv instead.\n. It looks like you're cutting off important parts of the URL.\n. & is used by the shell. You need to quote the URL in \"\" or ''.\n. The stream URL has probably expired or requires cookies/headers to be passed.\n. You will have to research what cookies or headers are needed, it's different for each service. The web developer tools in your browser are useful for this.\n. There has been som changes to the Hitbox plugin since 1.11.1 was released, please try the latest nightly/git version.\n. 1.12.0 is now out and should fix all issues.\n. Thanks for looking into this issue @trUSTssc, it was indeed a problem with AMF3. I've pushed a update that uses python-flashmedia's  decoder instead of the one built into librtmp.\n. The HLS implementation does not support seeking currently, it will have to be added before this can done.\n. Try this in your config:\nplayer=mpv --profile=live\nYou don't need to use --player-args to pass arguments to the player generally.\nThen use this in your script:\nlivestreamer --player-args \"--title='$title' {filename}\" \"$url\"\nThe title needs to be quoted or it will end up as --title=a title with spaces, which mpv will see as --title=a and then the rest ends up being positional arguments.\n. Could this be releated to #253?\n. Not possible until we support MPEG-DASH, we'll use #223 to track the issue.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. You must include {filename} somewhere in the --player-args or mpv will not know what to play. \nIt\u2019s usually enough to just use --player instead though, unless you need to add arguments after the filename.\nFor example,  --player 'mpv --screen=2 --geometry=+50+50'.\n. The only thing I can think of is that perhaps your connection has problems keeping a stable link when it is put under strain over a long period of time. Does running the stream at low or mobile quality help for example?\n. I pushed a potential fix (652dab1be3e80c029a9900164f67619c1c4c5b54) that should avoid the crash at least. But I'm still quite puzzled how you would end up exiting the main loop at all without a stream object.\n. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #706.\n. 1.12.0 is now out and should fix all issues.\n. > This is a brilliant addition,ive just come across that youve added this feature,but because its so new theres no documentation about it,so could someone please tell me how to add a cookie.txt file to this line ?\nNot sure what made you think so, but it has not been implemented yet.\n. > So the cookie itself still has to be added to the line ?\nCorrect.\n. url = \"http://127.0.0.1:88/hls://\" + url + \" headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.104 Safari/537.36', 'Cookie': 'cookie1=value;cookie2=value'}\"\nor \nurl = \"http://127.0.0.1:88/hls://\" + url + \" headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.104 Safari/537.36'} cookies={'cookie1': 'value', 'cookie2': 'value'}\"\n.

Please try the nightly build.\n. 1.12.0 is now out and should fix all issues. \n\nHow do i upgrade to the nightly build? Extremely confused!\n\nThe nightly build is just a zip file containing Livestreamer, just extract it and use.\n\nIf I update to the nightly build will I still get the update notification whenever the next stable build is released?\n\nYes.\n. > Is there any way of adding a prebuffer like in p2p so if the server does overload a bit, it wont affect the playback of the generared m3u8..?\nNo, if you want pre-buffering it should be done by the application consuming the stream (there is probably a option in ffmpeg for this). You can also try using multi-threaded streaming.\n. Are you using omxplayer? There has been issues in the past with this player, but upgrading to the latest version usally helps.\n. The tv4play plugin does not support premium streams currently. But even if it did, it would not help as the streams for the TV channels are encrypted using the DRM technology widevine.\n. Duplicate of #739.\n. You can use the --retry-open option to retry opening the stream and the --retry-streams option to retry fetching streams until success.\n. You can use --player-continuous-http to reconnect to streams during playback.\n. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #194.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for your report, this has been fixed by 243edf1b04d2e5a648b70564338a522543e4b2a2 and will be availabe in the next release soon.\n. It sounds like you're trying to use a GUI made for Livestreamer, but this project does not include one.\nI suggest you find the issue tracker for the GUI you're using and report your issue there instead.\n. See Installation and Tutorial.\n. Ah, the changelog is a bit wrong. After 1.11.1 was released the plugin was fixed and the changelog updated, but since then it was broken again (#739) which has not been fixed yet. We'll use #739 to track the latest problem.\n. Works fine here, try uninstalling, double check everything is removed from the install folder and then install again.\n. Implemented by #920.\n. > 403 Client Error: Forbidden\nThis usually means there is some security precautions stopping you from accessing the stream. In this case since it worked for a while it might be using some kind of heartbeat to verify your access continously.\n. The license states that you need to include the license of Livestreamer if you are distributing Livestreamer (either source or binaries). But if you are only calling the executable or using the Python API you don't need to include anything.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. > Can be caused by the new version of VLC ?\nDoes it help if you downgrade VLC?\n. > @chrippa I have VLC 2.0.1 and the VODs still will not work.\nCan you give an example URL?\n. Works fine for me with both VLC 2.1.5 and 2.2.0.\n. > If I uninstall VLC in order to get the most up to date one, will I also need to re-install Livestreamer?\nNo, Livestreamer has no special connection to any player, VLC just happens to be the default.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Sounds like specific issue in your VLC setup. Try changing video output and/or toggle accelerated video output.\n. Are you getting a error? If not, check that the stream actually has that many segments available in its playlist.\n. It was added in 1.8. If you're not getting an error then you're using a version that supports it. Can you link the stream you're trying?\n. Works fine here. --hls-live-edge=10 plays from segment 915.\n. The exact command I used: livestreamer --hls-live-edge=10 hls://http://idealoglx.zapto.org/testhls/playlist.m3u8 best\n. You can use the set_option method to set options in applications using Livestreamer as a library.\n. You should update the application that is using Livestreamer as a library, not the library itself.\n. Thanks!\n. These warnings does not have any effect on the ouput and can be safely ignored.\n. This is a bug in bbfreeze and not something that can be fixed on our end.\n. Thanks!\n. The log doesn't tell me much, but I think this is more likely to be an issue caused by the actual video playback rather than Livestreamer itself.\nPerhaps this is helpful: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14063?locale=en_US\n. Duplicate of #773.\n. Thanks, but this is only a workaround since it drops potentially neccessary query parameters. I've pushed a proper fix (55a097bdfe09afcd2758c6eecb90e3c184c41328).\n. Thanks for your PR. But to be honest I don't think automagic version strings are a good fit for dynamic languages like Python since it will require us to look up the version on each import, causing potential overhead. A better solution might be to bump the version number and add a 'dev' suffix after each release.\n. Thanks!\n. > Anyone familiar with updating of plugin, can drop me some hint on how exactly such problem can be tackled?\nYour best bet is to decompile the SWF and look at the code.\n. > I have nearly a complete feature on what to call but I am just not sure how to actually write it properly in the plugin since the plugin have no documentation so pretty much I am guessing what can be done in there. \nSorry about that, you can look at the existing plugins to get an idea how it works. Bascially you have access to these APIs and the Python standard library.\n\nAnother question is how do I test my modification? \n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to Python will get you started on Python development.\n. I'm not sure what main.py you're talking about, but I forgot to link these Livestreamer specific instructions which might be a bit clearer.\n. When you have the virtualenv activated it will use the code from the directory you ran python setup.py develop from.\n. > Is there a way to integrate the plugin directly in a WPF program seen that there is a binairie for Windows?\nI'm not sure what WPF is, but the Livestreamer API is only usable from Python. The binaries available are simply an embedded version of Python + Livestreamer.\n\nis the license I need to include in this program ? I want to credit Livestreamer's hard work and will do whatever you ask me.\n\nThis is the license.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the plugin will bypass the ads on Twitch, there is an option to put them?\n\nAds are always displayed by some external mechanism. It's up to you if you want to implement such things yourself, but it's not possible via Livestreamer.\n. > Does it say this for any other reason other than the risk of going to a site that might have a fake cert?\nNo, that's the reason.\n. Thanks!\n. You can try using multi-threaded streaming, but if that doesn't help only improving the connection between you and Twitch servers will help.\n. As the link in the error sugests, your Python version can't reliably be used for SSL connections. Either upgrade your Python or install an alternative SSL implementation.\n. Works fine here, what does livestreamer -j url output?\n. That stream is using HLS and should work fine, but the stream you posted in the original post was RTMP, please paste the output from a stream you're having issues with.\n. Hmm, works fine here. What happens if you run the command line outputted by livestreamer -c hitbox.tv/claine-kun?\n. I meant, what happens if you run that rtmpdump command?\n. Looks like your rtmpdump install is broken.\n. How did you install it? I don't know much about OS X but I think installing via homebrew should work.\n. I would like to update the link, but Twitch only supports having one redirect URL set at a time and changing it would break older Livestreamer versions. So it can't be done until the Twitch plugin breaks and forces anyone who wants to use it to upgrade.\n. This seems to be an issue with older setuptools versions, try easy_install --upgrade requests.\n. It looks like the player is refusing the input and exits. You can use --verbose-player to see its output.\n. Using --player-no-close might help.\n. I believe this was fixed in 1.12.1.\n. This seems to happen when DDoS protection is enabled on the site, but we can't get past that since it seems to require executing javascript in a browser.\n. It looks like you have installed Livestreamer into multiple directories and the oldest one is taking precedence. You can type echo %PATH% to see which paths are searched by the command prompt.\n. It may also be a firewall blocking Livestreamer.\n. You have a space in the URL. As described in the docs, any parameters after the URL is passed to the stream object.\nIn this case, HDS streams will pass any unknown parameters directly to the HTTP library requests, which throws an error about the unknown parameter.\n. You'll need at least 1.11.1. You can install it from source.\n. Duplicate of #163.\n. To use on the command line, just put them after livestreamer, e.g.\nlivstreamer --http-ignore-env http://url best\nFor use in the config, use the format described in the docs, e.g. \nhttp-ignore-env\nhls-segment-threads=2\n. Not sure what you mean by \"dropping frames\", do you mean skipping forward as much as possible when lag is detected? It depends on the stream protocol:\n- For RTMP I think rtmpdump already does something like this.\n- For segmented protocols such as HLS/HDS we should probably jump if we get a 404 since that usually means we are very far behind.\n- For regular HTTP streams I'm not sure we can really do anything.\n. This is already possible, see --default-stream.\n. Thanks!\n. You can try --hls-live-edge 99999.\n. Youtube playlist URLs seem to expire after a few hours, not sure if we can do anything about it unfortunately.\n. This is really strange, the crash happens because bad data is encountered when parsing the segment, but I'm not able to reproduce this at all. Do you use a proxy, VPN or anything else that might tinker with your HTTP traffic?\n. Livestreamer closes the player when it has fed all the data to the player by default. You can use --player-no-close to avoid this.\nWhile we're on the subject, it's probably time to change this silly behaviour now. It's been kept as is for a long time as I don't like to alter behaviour between releases of Livestreamer, but things change. \nAt the time Livestreamer was first created mplayer was in a crap state and mplayer2/mpv didn't exist yet, so using VLC was the only reasonable option. But I disliked the GUI hanging around when a stream ended so this behaviour was implemented. Nowdays mpv is the superior player and it handles end of stream much nicer than VLC aswell, so it's probably time for a change.\n. > It closes the player when it's fed all of the data, even if the player isn't done with playback? That seems... like an odd choice.\nAt the time the choice was made it made sense. It's hard to believe but Livestreamer is actually almost 4 years old now, back then it only did livestreams and losing a second or two of playback felt like a reasonably trade off to avoid having dead VLC windows floating around.\n. > What about MPC-HC? I don't want dead MPC-HC windows hanging around, so if this were to change there should be an option to have the same behavior as now.\nYes, of course. Though I'm thinking maybe it's worth a shot to attempt to detect what player is specified and set the default behaviour based on that instead.\n. You have to use it as command line option when starting the stream like livestreamer --twitch-oauth-token token twitch.tv/... best or preferably, put it in your config file.\n. This is a known issue (#346), and it seems to be caused by badly muxed streams from Twitch, but since only MPC-HC is affected I don't consider it a Livestreamer bug.\n. I was able to reproduce this a couple of days ago, but now that I was gonna take a closer look it seems to work fine. Perhaps it was a temporary issue on UStream's end?\n. Thanks!\n. Reading video from capture cards is out of scope for this project. I believe you can use ffmpeg or a video player with support for v4l to accomplish this instead.\n. Thanks!\n. Please try the latest nightly/git version.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here. Does --crunchyroll-purge-credentials help?\n. I believe this should be fixed with #865. Please try the latest nightly/git version.\n. I've pushed a 1.12.2 release with the fix now.\n. Looks like an issue with requests 2.6.1+. Downgrade to 2.6.0 until a fix is released.\n. It's because they are DVR-like streams - live but with the ability to jump backwards. You can use --hls-live-edge to jump backwards, e.g. --hls-live-edge 99999 would probably start at the beginning.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this here (Arch Linux and Debian). Tried urxvt, gnome-terminal and xterm.\n. Please try 1.12.2.\n. Unfortunately the ustream streaming protocol implementation in Livestreamer is not perfect. It has been reverse engineered from network sniffing so it is probably not behaving exactly the same as the flash player. The problem you're experiencing is that the server is telling us about new video segments available for download in a rather erratic pace, you can observe this via --loglevel debug.\nWhy exactly we seem to get segments from the server differently than the flash player is currently unknown, but one theory is that the flash player is reusing the connection to their server, whereas we reconnect everytime we want information about the segments.\n. Not sure if it makes sense for us to handle regular playlist files. Pretty much every player should handle them by themself.\n. Duplicate of #771.\n. Unfortunately the douyutv plugin is currently broken. The API now requires a special token to be generated, but noone has reverse engineered how this is done yet. See #809 for more information.\n. For 100% silent operation you can do livestreamer -Q -O url quality > filename.\n. Works fine here.\n. I tried both VLC and mpv. For VLC I just use default settings with ALSA output (because of #253). For mpv I use default settings with pulseaudio output.\n. I think this may be because the Fedora package of Livestreamer is based on Python 3. Try pip3 install python-librtmp.\n. I don't think playing playlists (with more than one stream in) really fits the Livestreamer CLI usage, you'll have to enter the URL of the stream you want watch instead. Though the streamlive plugin is currently broken (see #739), so that will not work etiher currently.\n. It looks like your Python build have stripped out the multiprocessing module, perhaps to reduce file size to fit on smaller ARM devices. Unfortunately the concurrent module which we use heavily depend on this module.\nYour options here are, either install a Python that contains the multiprocessing module or check if there is a extra package available that adds the module to your existing install.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Does --http-no-ssl-verify help?\n. Fixed by #929.\n. Are you writing to a file system that only supports max 2GB files, such as FAT32 or HFS?\nAre you getting any error?\n. I think I know why this happens. The HTTP streams from livestream.com sends a Content-Length header with the value 2GB, and the server is probably closing the connection after that amount of data has been read. You can try using the HLS streams (use --stream-types hls to filter out the other ones) instead.\n. This looks like a connection issue between your ISP and Twitch.\n. No, supported streaming protocols can be found here.\n. Not sure why you are getting timeout when connecting to the server, but increasing the stream timeout via --stream-timeout might help a bit.\n. I can't answer your question, but if you figure it out, please submit a patch to fix the plugin.\nI'll close this issue in favor of a single issue regarding streamlive, which is #739.\n. Can you confirm that this stream works on the original source or via a player capable of HTTP streams such as VLC? If not, then it is probably broken or not a normal HTTP stream and requires special support to be added.\n. Please upload your config file.\n. Thanks! For future reference, it is usually a good idea to use git rebase -i to clean up history before submitting a pull request.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. The problem is that the server seems to have banned the User-Agent for the library we use to do HTTP connections (requests). A workaround is to use another User-Agent (or even empty).\nVia the CLI:\nlivestreamer --http-header \"User-Agent=\" httpstream://http://iptv.wssiptv.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd/101.ts\nVia applications using the library (e.g. livestreamersrv) use this URL:\nhttpstream://http://iptv.wssiptv.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd.ts headers={'User-Agent': ''}\n. Continuous HTTP is a feature in the commandline interface, it's not possible to use via the library. If you want such functionality you will have to add it to livestreamersrv.\n. --http-ignore-env should tell Python not to use the system proxy. But if you already tried to disable it yourself it may not work.\n. Thanks!\n. Not sure why it would not have been installed automatically, but installing singledispatch via pip should solve the issue.\n. Hmm, perhaps you can try uninstalling both via pip uninstall and then install Livestreamer again. Also check if you have a distribution package for singledispatch installed which might interfere somehow.\n. Hmm, one more thing you can try is easy_install -U requests singledispatch livestreamer.\n. Thanks!\n. It looks like you're editing /usr/loca/bin/livestreamer instead of the config file.\n. livestreamer --player \"vlc --file-caching=6000 --network-caching=6000\".\n. If the token expires you'll probably have to write a plugin for the site in question, so the stream can be opened right after getting the URL.\n. Thanks!\n. Works fine here, make sure the URL you're using is pointing directly to a live event e.g. http://livestream.com/nrl/seaeaglesvtigers and not http://livestream.com/nrl.\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed by #961.\n. Thanks!\n. You can change the parameter used to name the streams by adding name_key=bitrate to the URL, e.g. livestreamer \"hlsvariant://... name_key=bitrate\".\nThough perhaps we should make all streams available even on name collisions.\n. DASH playback is currently not supported. We'll use #223 to track the issue.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. The Livestreamer CLI is designed to handle one stream at a time and it is not something that is easily changed and probably not worth it when you can use a simple wrapper (such as this) to launch multiple instances instead.\n. Once a Debian version is released it usually only receive security updates. The latest version of Livestreamer is available in Debian testing and unstable, or you can install from source.\n. Thanks!\n. Commited with correct authorship as 9732607a78fe08a593186e25401026653257976c.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. The site we host the docs on (readthedocs.org) inserts some javascript which is out our of control, however it does not seem to be behaving the way you describe it for me. I also get a AJAX request to grokthedocs.com, but only once and CPU usage is normal using Firefox 38.\n. Thanks!\n. Write a pugin for the site in question. Here are some examples\n. I don't know anything about i3, but shouldn't there be some wrapper command or something that does this? Seems kind of unreasonable to expect every application out there to implement this.\n. Thanks!\n. livestreamer --stream-types hls --stream-url \"http://ustream.tv/channel/live-iss-stream\" best will return a HLS stream URL if it's available.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. This is not what timeout means in this case. Timeout here means the time to wait without any data being received before aborting. There is currently no functionality for what you're asking, however you can use an external program such as timeout to accomplish this.\n. Not sure I understand your request, but if you want to skip a segment and move to the next one if it is too slow to download you can do it by setting the timeout lower and the maximum attempts to 1.\nHLS example, this will move on to the next segment if it failed to download a segment under 4 seconds:\nlivestreamer --hls-segment-attempts=1 --hls-segment-timeout=4\n. I see, I don't think that's really possible though. Segments must be played in the correct order or the player will run into playback issues, such as audio sync issues, freezing video or just stop completly. \nThe only way to play a segment from the past correctly would be to reinitialize the video decoder, but that is something we can't do from our end since we just feed the player a stream of data.\n. Thanks!\n. Livestreamer does not write the stream buffer to disk, it's kept in memory.\n. The fallback is only used when deciding on what stream to attempt to open, for example if 720p is not available it will open 480p and so on. It does not however move to the next one if there is an error after that.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. ",
    "ghost": "You were totally right I did a bad mistake with homebrew. Issue closed.\n. This happen on all twitch streams on live quality with high bitrate and/or fps. On 720p happened once or so.\nJust tested with cache and no issues. I think it's solved. Thank You!\n. No it's not. Now I get Cache not filling, consider increasing -cache and/or -cache-min! after few minutes, even with --cache=49152\n. Yes they do well. Also I was using this method before, and it works fine. So I don't think it's bandwidth. No change with vlc.\n. I don't know if it is python-sh related but 1.3.2 seems to be working fine. Oh, and afaict stream continues downloading even when playback stops on git version.\n/tmp/livestreamercrhfe8.err (livestreamer-git):\n```\nRTMPDump v2.4\n(c) 2010 Andrej Stepanchuk, Howard Chu, The Flvstreamer Team; license: GPL\nConnecting ...\nINFO: Connected...\nStarting Live Stream\nINFO: Metadata:\nINFO:   author              \nINFO:   copyright           \nINFO:   description         \nINFO:   keywords            \nINFO:   rating              \nINFO:   title               \nINFO:   presetname            Custom\nINFO:   creationdate          Sun Oct 28 16:43:30 2012\nINFO:   videodevice           XSplitBroadcaster\nINFO:   framerate             60.00\nINFO:   width                 1280.00\nINFO:   height                720.00\nINFO:   videocodecid          avc1\nINFO:   avclevel              51.00\nINFO:   avcprofile            100.00\nINFO:   videodatarate         390.62\nINFO:   videokeyframe_frequency0.00\nINFO:   audiodevice           VHAudioCustom\nINFO:   audiosamplerate       44100.00\nINFO:   audiochannels         1.00\nINFO:   audioinputvolume      100.00\nINFO:   audiocodecid          mp4a\nINFO:   audiodatarate         218.75\nINFO:   bufferSize            3000k\nINFO:   maxBitrate            3000k\nINFO:   xsplitBroadcasterVersion1.3.0.10\nINFO:   xsplitCoreVersion     1.0.1206.0203 Version 1.0\nINFO:   xsplitGameSourceVersion1.1.0.21\nINFO:   xsplitMediaLibVersion 2.0.0.102\n0.772 kB / 0.00 sec\n130.501 kB / 5.12 sec\n556.437 kB / 6.15 sec\n1096.949 kB / 7.75 sec\n1591.274 kB / 9.42 sec\n1728.502 kB / 9.68 sec\n1926.715 kB / 10.05 sec\n1992.556 kB / 10.17 sec\n2089.210 kB / 10.38 sec\n2203.408 kB / 10.63 sec\n2323.576 kB / 10.94 sec\n2347.861 kB / 11.03 sec\n2526.626 kB / 11.54 sec\n2590.918 kB / 11.70 sec\n2778.643 kB / 12.19 sec\n2920.536 kB / 12.60 sec\n3013.648 kB / 12.80 sec\n3091.669 kB / 13.12 sec\n3102.282 kB / 13.16 sec\n3214.295 kB / 13.40 sec\n3230.838 kB / 13.47 sec\n3295.586 kB / 13.58 sec\n3395.944 kB / 13.75 sec\n3553.769 kB / 13.98 sec\n3603.227 kB / 14.12 sec\n3732.895 kB / 15.19 sec\n3765.568 kB / 15.56 sec\n3791.998 kB / 15.70 sec\n3799.288 kB / 15.77 sec\n3839.179 kB / 16.35 sec\n3854.805 kB / 16.50 sec\n3933.672 kB / 17.34 sec\n3936.154 kB / 17.41 sec\n3945.150 kB / 17.46 sec\n4020.384 kB / 17.65 sec\n4067.257 kB / 17.83 sec\n4152.540 kB / 17.97 sec\n4238.331 kB / 18.18 sec\n4307.043 kB / 18.42 sec\n4376.170 kB / 18.98 sec\n4446.636 kB / 19.48 sec\n4515.913 kB / 20.04 sec\n4543.066 kB / 20.25 sec\n4560.982 kB / 20.60 sec\n4565.983 kB / 20.78 sec\n4573.872 kB / 20.97 sec\n4608.368 kB / 21.39 sec\n4622.707 kB / 21.64 sec\n4649.328 kB / 22.06 sec\n4738.509 kB / 22.45 sec\n4822.699 kB / 22.62 sec\n4981.458 kB / 22.92 sec\n5019.093 kB / 22.99 sec\n5212.374 kB / 23.35 sec\n5288.292 kB / 23.52 sec\n5419.760 kB / 23.82 sec\n5529.149 kB / 24.09 sec\n5568.433 kB / 24.17 sec\n5655.711 kB / 24.36 sec\n5825.392 kB / 24.93 sec\n5965.690 kB / 25.29 sec\n6096.659 kB / 25.59 sec\n6247.460 kB / 25.97 sec\n```\n.

When I want a new version I should do \"pip uninstall livestreamer\" and then do step 8 again (install livestreamer) and then do step 9?\n. Try put the url in quotes \"\"\nIt doesn't work for me if i don't put it like:\nlivestreamer \"azubu.tv/channel/detail.do?cn_id=2125982449001\" best\n. Are you using the latest files (the develop version) or the one that's released to public?\n. Why would you close it? Removing -url doesn't solve anything.\n. But that's what I did, I used the installer only. And it shows only some of Twitch streams, not all of them for some reason. It all got installed to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer and I run my .bat from Desktop.\n. Path's correct and reinstalled and nothing. You can air twitch.tv/mlgsc2 using .bat like mine ? I am on Windows 8 x64.\n. So now the script is:\n@echo\ncd C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\nlivestreamer.exe twitch.tv/mlgsc2 best\n@echo off\nAnd it doesn't work. But if I change /mlgsc2 to any other channel, it works just fine.\n. Woah how does it give you full path to http://usher.twitch.tv/stream/multi_playlist/mlgsc2.m3u8 ? I don't get that. And like I said all channels I watch work just fine, except that twitch.tv/mlgsc2 which is offline now. So I do not get it what's the problem.\nI am on Windows 8 x64 and my paths are:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe (2.1.0)\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer.exe\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\rtmpdump.exe\nAnd I used the 32bit installer from https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/releases/download/v1.6.1/livestreamer-v1.6.1-win32-setup.exe\n. There it is https://pastee.org/qa2cs (no key)\n. Hey it actually fixed it and works now. Gives same message as karlo2105 posted before. So I don't get it what was wrong. The docu on that file says I have to use \"\" quotes for paths with spaces, so with quotes it doesn't work, but removing quotes it works fine.\nThanks for all help.\n. No it wasn't.\n. @karlo2105 \nthe stream you are trying to watch is made by Verimatrix software with enabled security. If you want to watch such stream, you first need valid client certificate, so the server can check if you are allowed to watch choosen stream. Even then, you would need to modify HLSStream module to append postfix to keyfile url with your client ID.\n. in hls.py you need to change a line (around 260) to look like this:\npython\nres = urlget(absolute_url(self.url, tags[\"EXT-X-KEY\"][0][\"URI\"] + \"&v=<clientID>\"),\n                         exception=StreamError, verify=False,\n                         cert=('/path/to/client.crt', '/path/to/private.key'))\nThis is only quick patch, command line options should be made for this.\nAbout other stuff, please send me an e-mail.\n. Great, it works!\nJust one slight annoyance. If I specify uri parameter v with params={'v':'id'}, every url gets this parameters, some multiple times. For example, segment uri get three same parameters:\nhttp://example.com/segment_1.ts?v=id&v=id&v=id\n. Good point! Yes, server appends every parameter it receives to \"sub\" urls. You can try it yourself.\nhttp://cds-sr1.vmo3.sbb.rs/live/disk/slo1_slo/hls/slo1_slo.m3u8?test=1\nTry changing or adding parameters to this url.\nSorry, another encoded one, but I don't have any other examples. Anyway, you could check this via wget or curl.\n. Ok, no problems from my side. I just wanted to inform you.\n. No, because it uses non standard encryption. Maybe you can deduce something from original app which can play it.\n. METHOD field could be only NONE or AES-128. As you can see, this stream uses NON standard values, probably encrypted some way.\n. To make it work, you must have access to original app/website/... just to be able to analyze how this work. Then you would need some reverse engineering skills which I presume you don't have and at the end you would need to change livestreamer to support this kind of stream...\nIn short, it's probably possible but too much hassle for beginner.\n. check profile, you have few minutes...\n. @vpeter4 Google it, there is A LOT of material, just go and learn. Every situation is specific, so there is no short answer. In a lot of cases it's even illegal...\n. They are broadcasting but the channels are private... Maybe if there was a way to use the regex (like sportsdevil does with ilive.to) to use them from an external plugin...\n. Hey great thanks for your support, thats one of my first pull's. \nI will first read some python manuals & reviste the code on my holiday.\nThanks for the patience\u200e xD\n. Yes, I'm running v1.7.3\n. Hmm. ~~Well the only real difference between vanilla and this I would say is it uses madVR video renderer. Perhaps that is the issue.~~ Tried to use normal rendering, didn't work. I guess I should find some small portable player program for this.\nEDIT: Yeah, using vanilla MPC-HC works just fine.\n. Hm, well it installs\nMPC-HC 1.7.3\nmadVR v0.86.11\nLAVFilters-0.60.1 x86\nxy-VSFilter 3.0.0.211\nReClock v1.8.8.3 (optional)\nI'm not sure what could possibly cause problems from that.\nEitherway, for now I've installed VLC into the Livestreamer folder for this purpose plus it has cache options so it seems like the better choice.\n. Maybe that can thas help some one, I use firefox+open with and mpv/youtube-dl, I can chose my sub but I don't have premiun account (thing work too).\n. A solution was found by vitorgalvo: if you enter player=/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/vlc/2.1.4/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC into your configuration file, it will work.\n. debugPortID = 84;\nsetGeoCode = 5;\ndef parseToken(self,token):\n   token = token.split(\":\")\n   tokenString = \"\"\n   for tok in token:\n      tokenString = tokenString + unichr(((int(tok.replace(\"0m0\", \"\")) / debugPortID) / setGeoCode));\n   return  tokenString\nI've been looking into making a vaughnlive plugin for a while now but couldn't get anything working above is python code used to decode the weird token given in the flashvars\nexample of weird token given in flash vars:\n0m049140:0m023100:0m031080:0m042840:0m034020:0m042000:0m044520:0m048720:0m043260:0m049560:0m028140:0m037380:0m044520:0m031080:0m034440:0m037380:0m035280:0m043680:0m033180:0m048300:0m021420:0m034860:0m037380:0m036120:0m022680:0m041580:0m047880:0m047040:0m030660:0m041580:0m050400:0m048720\nThis token seems to change every time you refresh the page\nhere is an example of a parsed token: 9EtOQKEYYl56uBzmvqFBazac93zzQTl\nI've had no luck after this hope this information is useful to others!\n. Any word on how this is going? it's been almost a month without a fix\n. I don't know anything about coding for this, so no way for me to be able to submit any kinda patches\n. I think you're searching for sth. like #442 with the --sout parameter to be set within your livestreamer-config.\nBut I doubt it works as expected since on the second device you'd have a caching-delay too thought.\nInstead you could manually adjust your caching-delay to be the same by using the [, ], +, - key-bindings of VLC speeding-up/slowing-down the playback-speed. Works fine if you're watching streams containing a game-time display or sth. like. But of cause it's a bit annoying to do this always.\nPS: If the caching-delays differ a lot use the n key on both devices to skip to the bleeding-edge and re-cache.\n. I also get this error. These are the following things I have typed into the command line to try and run it.\n- \"livestreamer twitch.tv/CHANNEL\"\n- \"livestreamer --default-stream best --retry-streams 4 --retry-open 10 --stream-segment-threads 4 --twitch-oauth-token lsl1h31filc9j4bk408w372hmhewoe --ringbuffer-size 512K --hls-live-edge 2 --player-passthrough hls twitch.tv/CHANNEL\"\n  My configuration file, http://pastebin.com/irQUcn0A\n  Version 1.11.1\n  \nIf you need anything else please ask.\n. Windows 7, 64-bit, SP 1\n\nI am in the services key, I just have a service selected. I have created what I see in the following photo.\n\nIt now works fine, even though I'm missing what is in the Enum key. Thanks!\n. can no one shed any light on this issue? Granted its a pretty unusual one I would suspect.\n. First, thank you very much for responding. Now on to what you said, I did think of that. But back when I used to watch streams on twitch, I would watch on medium or low because I would just listen to the streams as background noise and nothing would happen (I would watch them that low because flash player is a piece of crap) and I could listen to the streams and play hearthstone for 2 hours straight and nothing would go wrong. But even when I would watch on source, nothing would go wrong... Is livestreamer different? Something weird did happen last night where I got an error and it said couldn't load segment, but my computer was doing something in the back round and was being weird for a little while (I think avast was updating and was hogging my internet, this did not happen all the other times my problem persisted so it should have no inlfuence) and then everything fixed itself about 20 minutes later.\nAssuming you are correct (which im sure you know what your talking about) is there any way I could confirm it and if it is as you said, not strong enough and buckles over long use, is there any way to fix it? Whenever I do a ping test, no packets get lost or anything like that. I am sure if I call my isp, they won't be able to help me at all so I am at a loss on what to do.\nIf it does help, on my laptop's wifi, I can be watching a stream for 2 hours and then at the same time, buffer a 3-4 20 minute long videos and it still won't lose connection, is my main desktop just a piece of crap? Doesn't help my desktop's case when my laptop is 8 years old as wellXD\nAlso last piece of info, I have 57-58 down and 28-29 up so that makes me think my internet connection isn't unstable unless I am a complete moron and have no idea how things work.\n. Just want to let know it just happened again and Im watching a stream through livestreamer on high and that's all I am doing and the error I got was 11004,,,, Man I hate my lifeXD\nUpdate! I called my isp to see if they could shed any light and low and behold they did, guy said he can see it on his end, the signal with my router is messed up. They are sending someone out in a few days, will let you know what happens.\n. Thanks but i think you want write \n--http-cookie \"Cookie=alid=I0yYW6z...............\"\nSo for --http-header \n--http-header \"User-Agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android.....,.............\"\n. pending the issue is resolved\nyou can use hlsvariant\n. i'm not use the easiest way\ni use Tv4 app on android and i sniff the traffic to get the address of hls protocol\nbut there are easier way\nfor the first example on a PC the site use hds protocol\nso \n. yes with this code \n_channel_id_re = re.compile(\"\\\"channelId\\\":(\\d+)\")\nit works\nthanks trUSTssc\n. meanwhile\nyou can do this \nlivestreamer \"hds://http://worldlive.arirang.co.kr/arirang/arirangtvworld.mp4.f4m\" best -o arirang.flv\n. I'm kind of already doing that minus the livestreamer part, just would be great if livestreamer already pulled that info so I don't have to worry about having to find all that if I lose the links or w/e\n. There's a posting in the google forum for livestreamer with a 'patch' that provides a timer. \nSee https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/livestreamer/BMlxr9wQCkc\nIt would be very useful to have this capability within the core/main release as other forks are behind the main code base. \nNot suggesting necessarily that the patch is appropriate to just go into the main code base as is, but might be a useful starting point.\nAppreciate all your hard work.

I've only saved streams from livestream. Any tips?\n. @VackerSimon That would help a lot, thanks! I'll give it a try on Windows 7 but I'm running it over Parallels on my Mac\n. Ubuntu is on a VPS running ReiserFS, so that could be it, but on Mac I'm trying to write to an ext3 partition and Debian is on extFAT. I do not get any errors, it simply terminates when the file size reaches 2GB. I'm always attempting to fetch live streams from news.livestream.com. I'll try again on Monday with another stream on all systems and post the entire output.\nThanks a lot for the quick replies!\n. @chrippa That makes a lot of sense. If I attempt to download the stream on the browser it creates a 2GB file as well. Thanks a lot for that catch, I tried using hls other times with livestreamer but it didn't work out. I'll try it out on monday with the latest version!\n. It worked with the --stream-types hls option, thanks! Maybe it's something to clarify on livestream.\n. Noticed this issue a month ago, it is not fixed yet.\nhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/860\nDefault quality e.g.best/720p+/480p/360p/akamai cdn have this problem.\nResulting the file lose few segments repeatly, but mobile quality work fine.\nmobile_720p\n\nmobile_360p\n\nbest(720p)\n\n720p+_alt_akamai\n\n. Yes, but not every stream have this option.\n. wrong token\ntoken=deadsoon%%7\n. read in flash memory with winhex for example\n http://stream-recorder.com/forum/cant-play-channel-because-token-t18788.html \n. ok find pid of your flashpluggin and use gdb to debug and Ghex to read file.core created by gdb\nhttp://stream-recorder.com/forum/use-rtmpdump-rtmpsrv-linux-t7661.html\n. hi\n hls joke HD is available\nlivestreamer \"http://www.filmon.com/tv/itv1\"\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin filmon for URL http://www.filmon.com/tv/itv1\nAvailable streams: high (best), high_hls, low (worst), low_hls\n. ISS live stream : http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iss-hdev-payload\n. $ livestreamer -V\nlivestreamer 1.10.2\nis it the lastest ? i tried to install livestreamer with pip but it can only run on root\n. well it seems that the debian package is outdated ?\n. I installed the lastest version with pip and it's working ! thanks\n. I think they started using the player verification, is it possible to post the full url (the one which fetch fragments) along with the cookies by playing the stream on their site. I am trying to make my addon to work too which stopped recently. \n. Looks like those values (except the key-pair-id one) change with each request/invocation. I tested with livestreamer 1.12.2 (latest available on gentoo) but I cannot get it to work by manually inputting the values that it spits out the first time it fails. (because they change with each invocation)\nEDIT2: ignore everything below - I was failling hard.\nExample:\n``` bash\n$ livestreamer --stream-url --http-header 'User-Agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/600.5.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0.5 Safari/600.5.17;

So, they show up okay, but their values are different, except for CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id\nSo much fail in this post, on my side:) I ACK! \n. Just realized that it works fine with youtube-dl   Yields a .mp4\n. One thought - I'm noticing tonight that the plugin is getting 503 errors from picarto due to the Cloudflare DDOS protection mechanism.  Has anyone implemented a Cloudflare work-around in a livestreamer plugin?  Would be handy :)\n. My internet should be fine. I have 100mbps internet and my ping even with it streaming is 60 or lower, which is the norm for me. I stream netflix all the time and have never had an issue before. And, models becoming moving fixed objects in the game isn't a ping issue. I have also never heard of lag causing sound to completely disappear from a game.\n. Thanks for diving into this. As a tl;dr - a workaround is to change line 78 in livestreamer/src/livestreamer/stream/hls_playlist.py from\nbandwidth = int(bandwidth)\nto\nbandwidth = 0 if bandwitdh == 'None' else int(bandwidth)\nEdit: Corrected typo.\n. The code I posted should only be used as a momentary workaround, if at all ;)\nA better patch would be to ignore malformed streams in the playlist and move ahead with the valid ones.

(See http://docs.livestreamer.io/install.html Source section).\n. @mdc2008, it's not related to python. I uses Telerik Fiddler to modify/replay the API request.\n. @StarWolf3000 How does one use these options? I keep getting \"unrecognized argument\" errors when I use:\nsubprocess.call([\"livestreamer\", \"*.com/\" + user, \"best --retry-streams 10 --retry-open 50\", \"-o\", \".\\recorded\\\"+get_filename()])\nI've tried putting the options various other places as well, but none of them seem to work.\n. @intact Thank you. Apologies for turning this into a stackexchange thread.\n. I used to get this error and found out it was due to a program I had installed called SSL Enforcer. Turning off the SSL Enforcer fixed it for me.\n. On further checking, the issue seems to be occurring with streaming from VLC as well as recording from Livestreamer. I guess the issue isn't just Livestreamer. I'd close this but I don't know how.\n. ok thankyou\n. it's endless looping game.\nchange IFNO_URL to (notice mvn is changed to mnv): \nINFO_URL = \"http://mvn.vaughnsoft.net/video/edge/mnv-{domain}_{channel}\"\n. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=replace+text+in+file+bat\n.

Now I get Cache not filling, consider increasing -cache and/or -cache-min! after few minutes, even with --cache=49152\n. Yes they do well. Also I was using this method before, and it works fine. So I don't think it's bandwidth. No change with vlc.\n. I don't know if it is python-sh related but 1.3.2 seems to be working fine. Oh, and afaict stream continues downloading even when playback stops on git version.\n/tmp/livestreamercrhfe8.err (livestreamer-git):\n```\nRTMPDump v2.4\n(c) 2010 Andrej Stepanchuk, Howard Chu, The Flvstreamer Team; license: GPL\nConnecting ...\nINFO: Connected...\nStarting Live Stream\nINFO: Metadata:\nINFO:   author              \nINFO:   copyright           \nINFO:   description         \nINFO:   keywords            \nINFO:   rating              \nINFO:   title               \nINFO:   presetname            Custom\nINFO:   creationdate          Sun Oct 28 16:43:30 2012\nINFO:   videodevice           XSplitBroadcaster\nINFO:   framerate             60.00\nINFO:   width                 1280.00\nINFO:   height                720.00\nINFO:   videocodecid          avc1\nINFO:   avclevel              51.00\nINFO:   avcprofile            100.00\nINFO:   videodatarate         390.62\nINFO:   videokeyframe_frequency0.00\nINFO:   audiodevice           VHAudioCustom\nINFO:   audiosamplerate       44100.00\nINFO:   audiochannels         1.00\nINFO:   audioinputvolume      100.00\nINFO:   audiocodecid          mp4a\nINFO:   audiodatarate         218.75\nINFO:   bufferSize            3000k\nINFO:   maxBitrate            3000k\nINFO:   xsplitBroadcasterVersion1.3.0.10\nINFO:   xsplitCoreVersion     1.0.1206.0203 Version 1.0\nINFO:   xsplitGameSourceVersion1.1.0.21\nINFO:   xsplitMediaLibVersion 2.0.0.102\n0.772 kB / 0.00 sec\n130.501 kB / 5.12 sec\n556.437 kB / 6.15 sec\n1096.949 kB / 7.75 sec\n1591.274 kB / 9.42 sec\n1728.502 kB / 9.68 sec\n1926.715 kB / 10.05 sec\n1992.556 kB / 10.17 sec\n2089.210 kB / 10.38 sec\n2203.408 kB / 10.63 sec\n2323.576 kB / 10.94 sec\n2347.861 kB / 11.03 sec\n2526.626 kB / 11.54 sec\n2590.918 kB / 11.70 sec\n2778.643 kB / 12.19 sec\n2920.536 kB / 12.60 sec\n3013.648 kB / 12.80 sec\n3091.669 kB / 13.12 sec\n3102.282 kB / 13.16 sec\n3214.295 kB / 13.40 sec\n3230.838 kB / 13.47 sec\n3295.586 kB / 13.58 sec\n3395.944 kB / 13.75 sec\n3553.769 kB / 13.98 sec\n3603.227 kB / 14.12 sec\n3732.895 kB / 15.19 sec\n3765.568 kB / 15.56 sec\n3791.998 kB / 15.70 sec\n3799.288 kB / 15.77 sec\n3839.179 kB / 16.35 sec\n3854.805 kB / 16.50 sec\n3933.672 kB / 17.34 sec\n3936.154 kB / 17.41 sec\n3945.150 kB / 17.46 sec\n4020.384 kB / 17.65 sec\n4067.257 kB / 17.83 sec\n4152.540 kB / 17.97 sec\n4238.331 kB / 18.18 sec\n4307.043 kB / 18.42 sec\n4376.170 kB / 18.98 sec\n4446.636 kB / 19.48 sec\n4515.913 kB / 20.04 sec\n4543.066 kB / 20.25 sec\n4560.982 kB / 20.60 sec\n4565.983 kB / 20.78 sec\n4573.872 kB / 20.97 sec\n4608.368 kB / 21.39 sec\n4622.707 kB / 21.64 sec\n4649.328 kB / 22.06 sec\n4738.509 kB / 22.45 sec\n4822.699 kB / 22.62 sec\n4981.458 kB / 22.92 sec\n5019.093 kB / 22.99 sec\n5212.374 kB / 23.35 sec\n5288.292 kB / 23.52 sec\n5419.760 kB / 23.82 sec\n5529.149 kB / 24.09 sec\n5568.433 kB / 24.17 sec\n5655.711 kB / 24.36 sec\n5825.392 kB / 24.93 sec\n5965.690 kB / 25.29 sec\n6096.659 kB / 25.59 sec\n6247.460 kB / 25.97 sec\n```\n.

When I want a new version I should do \"pip uninstall livestreamer\" and then do step 8 again (install livestreamer) and then do step 9?\n. Try put the url in quotes \"\"\nIt doesn't work for me if i don't put it like:\nlivestreamer \"azubu.tv/channel/detail.do?cn_id=2125982449001\" best\n. Are you using the latest files (the develop version) or the one that's released to public?\n. Why would you close it? Removing -url doesn't solve anything.\n. But that's what I did, I used the installer only. And it shows only some of Twitch streams, not all of them for some reason. It all got installed to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer and I run my .bat from Desktop.\n. Path's correct and reinstalled and nothing. You can air twitch.tv/mlgsc2 using .bat like mine ? I am on Windows 8 x64.\n. So now the script is:\n@echo\ncd C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\nlivestreamer.exe twitch.tv/mlgsc2 best\n@echo off\nAnd it doesn't work. But if I change /mlgsc2 to any other channel, it works just fine.\n. Woah how does it give you full path to http://usher.twitch.tv/stream/multi_playlist/mlgsc2.m3u8 ? I don't get that. And like I said all channels I watch work just fine, except that twitch.tv/mlgsc2 which is offline now. So I do not get it what's the problem.\nI am on Windows 8 x64 and my paths are:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe (2.1.0)\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer.exe\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\rtmpdump.exe\nAnd I used the 32bit installer from https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/releases/download/v1.6.1/livestreamer-v1.6.1-win32-setup.exe\n. There it is https://pastee.org/qa2cs (no key)\n. Hey it actually fixed it and works now. Gives same message as karlo2105 posted before. So I don't get it what was wrong. The docu on that file says I have to use \"\" quotes for paths with spaces, so with quotes it doesn't work, but removing quotes it works fine.\nThanks for all help.\n. No it wasn't.\n. @karlo2105 \nthe stream you are trying to watch is made by Verimatrix software with enabled security. If you want to watch such stream, you first need valid client certificate, so the server can check if you are allowed to watch choosen stream. Even then, you would need to modify HLSStream module to append postfix to keyfile url with your client ID.\n. in hls.py you need to change a line (around 260) to look like this:\npython\nres = urlget(absolute_url(self.url, tags[\"EXT-X-KEY\"][0][\"URI\"] + \"&v=<clientID>\"),\n                         exception=StreamError, verify=False,\n                         cert=('/path/to/client.crt', '/path/to/private.key'))\nThis is only quick patch, command line options should be made for this.\nAbout other stuff, please send me an e-mail.\n. Great, it works!\nJust one slight annoyance. If I specify uri parameter v with params={'v':'id'}, every url gets this parameters, some multiple times. For example, segment uri get three same parameters:\nhttp://example.com/segment_1.ts?v=id&v=id&v=id\n. Good point! Yes, server appends every parameter it receives to \"sub\" urls. You can try it yourself.\nhttp://cds-sr1.vmo3.sbb.rs/live/disk/slo1_slo/hls/slo1_slo.m3u8?test=1\nTry changing or adding parameters to this url.\nSorry, another encoded one, but I don't have any other examples. Anyway, you could check this via wget or curl.\n. Ok, no problems from my side. I just wanted to inform you.\n. No, because it uses non standard encryption. Maybe you can deduce something from original app which can play it.\n. METHOD field could be only NONE or AES-128. As you can see, this stream uses NON standard values, probably encrypted some way.\n. To make it work, you must have access to original app/website/... just to be able to analyze how this work. Then you would need some reverse engineering skills which I presume you don't have and at the end you would need to change livestreamer to support this kind of stream...\nIn short, it's probably possible but too much hassle for beginner.\n. check profile, you have few minutes...\n. @vpeter4 Google it, there is A LOT of material, just go and learn. Every situation is specific, so there is no short answer. In a lot of cases it's even illegal...\n. They are broadcasting but the channels are private... Maybe if there was a way to use the regex (like sportsdevil does with ilive.to) to use them from an external plugin...\n. Hey great thanks for your support, thats one of my first pull's. \nI will first read some python manuals & reviste the code on my holiday.\nThanks for the patience\u200e xD\n. Yes, I'm running v1.7.3\n. Hmm. ~~Well the only real difference between vanilla and this I would say is it uses madVR video renderer. Perhaps that is the issue.~~ Tried to use normal rendering, didn't work. I guess I should find some small portable player program for this.\nEDIT: Yeah, using vanilla MPC-HC works just fine.\n. Hm, well it installs\nMPC-HC 1.7.3\nmadVR v0.86.11\nLAVFilters-0.60.1 x86\nxy-VSFilter 3.0.0.211\nReClock v1.8.8.3 (optional)\nI'm not sure what could possibly cause problems from that.\nEitherway, for now I've installed VLC into the Livestreamer folder for this purpose plus it has cache options so it seems like the better choice.\n. Maybe that can thas help some one, I use firefox+open with and mpv/youtube-dl, I can chose my sub but I don't have premiun account (thing work too).\n. A solution was found by vitorgalvo: if you enter player=/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/vlc/2.1.4/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC into your configuration file, it will work.\n. debugPortID = 84;\nsetGeoCode = 5;\ndef parseToken(self,token):\n   token = token.split(\":\")\n   tokenString = \"\"\n   for tok in token:\n      tokenString = tokenString + unichr(((int(tok.replace(\"0m0\", \"\")) / debugPortID) / setGeoCode));\n   return  tokenString\nI've been looking into making a vaughnlive plugin for a while now but couldn't get anything working above is python code used to decode the weird token given in the flashvars\nexample of weird token given in flash vars:\n0m049140:0m023100:0m031080:0m042840:0m034020:0m042000:0m044520:0m048720:0m043260:0m049560:0m028140:0m037380:0m044520:0m031080:0m034440:0m037380:0m035280:0m043680:0m033180:0m048300:0m021420:0m034860:0m037380:0m036120:0m022680:0m041580:0m047880:0m047040:0m030660:0m041580:0m050400:0m048720\nThis token seems to change every time you refresh the page\nhere is an example of a parsed token: 9EtOQKEYYl56uBzmvqFBazac93zzQTl\nI've had no luck after this hope this information is useful to others!\n. Any word on how this is going? it's been almost a month without a fix\n. I don't know anything about coding for this, so no way for me to be able to submit any kinda patches\n. I think you're searching for sth. like #442 with the --sout parameter to be set within your livestreamer-config.\nBut I doubt it works as expected since on the second device you'd have a caching-delay too thought.\nInstead you could manually adjust your caching-delay to be the same by using the [, ], +, - key-bindings of VLC speeding-up/slowing-down the playback-speed. Works fine if you're watching streams containing a game-time display or sth. like. But of cause it's a bit annoying to do this always.\nPS: If the caching-delays differ a lot use the n key on both devices to skip to the bleeding-edge and re-cache.\n. I also get this error. These are the following things I have typed into the command line to try and run it.\n- \"livestreamer twitch.tv/CHANNEL\"\n- \"livestreamer --default-stream best --retry-streams 4 --retry-open 10 --stream-segment-threads 4 --twitch-oauth-token lsl1h31filc9j4bk408w372hmhewoe --ringbuffer-size 512K --hls-live-edge 2 --player-passthrough hls twitch.tv/CHANNEL\"\n  My configuration file, http://pastebin.com/irQUcn0A\n  Version 1.11.1\n  \nIf you need anything else please ask.\n. Windows 7, 64-bit, SP 1\n\nI am in the services key, I just have a service selected. I have created what I see in the following photo.\n\nIt now works fine, even though I'm missing what is in the Enum key. Thanks!\n. can no one shed any light on this issue? Granted its a pretty unusual one I would suspect.\n. First, thank you very much for responding. Now on to what you said, I did think of that. But back when I used to watch streams on twitch, I would watch on medium or low because I would just listen to the streams as background noise and nothing would happen (I would watch them that low because flash player is a piece of crap) and I could listen to the streams and play hearthstone for 2 hours straight and nothing would go wrong. But even when I would watch on source, nothing would go wrong... Is livestreamer different? Something weird did happen last night where I got an error and it said couldn't load segment, but my computer was doing something in the back round and was being weird for a little while (I think avast was updating and was hogging my internet, this did not happen all the other times my problem persisted so it should have no inlfuence) and then everything fixed itself about 20 minutes later.\nAssuming you are correct (which im sure you know what your talking about) is there any way I could confirm it and if it is as you said, not strong enough and buckles over long use, is there any way to fix it? Whenever I do a ping test, no packets get lost or anything like that. I am sure if I call my isp, they won't be able to help me at all so I am at a loss on what to do.\nIf it does help, on my laptop's wifi, I can be watching a stream for 2 hours and then at the same time, buffer a 3-4 20 minute long videos and it still won't lose connection, is my main desktop just a piece of crap? Doesn't help my desktop's case when my laptop is 8 years old as wellXD\nAlso last piece of info, I have 57-58 down and 28-29 up so that makes me think my internet connection isn't unstable unless I am a complete moron and have no idea how things work.\n. Just want to let know it just happened again and Im watching a stream through livestreamer on high and that's all I am doing and the error I got was 11004,,,, Man I hate my lifeXD\nUpdate! I called my isp to see if they could shed any light and low and behold they did, guy said he can see it on his end, the signal with my router is messed up. They are sending someone out in a few days, will let you know what happens.\n. Thanks but i think you want write \n--http-cookie \"Cookie=alid=I0yYW6z...............\"\nSo for --http-header \n--http-header \"User-Agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android.....,.............\"\n. pending the issue is resolved\nyou can use hlsvariant\n. i'm not use the easiest way\ni use Tv4 app on android and i sniff the traffic to get the address of hls protocol\nbut there are easier way\nfor the first example on a PC the site use hds protocol\nso \n. yes with this code \n_channel_id_re = re.compile(\"\\\"channelId\\\":(\\d+)\")\nit works\nthanks trUSTssc\n. meanwhile\nyou can do this \nlivestreamer \"hds://http://worldlive.arirang.co.kr/arirang/arirangtvworld.mp4.f4m\" best -o arirang.flv\n. I'm kind of already doing that minus the livestreamer part, just would be great if livestreamer already pulled that info so I don't have to worry about having to find all that if I lose the links or w/e\n. There's a posting in the google forum for livestreamer with a 'patch' that provides a timer. \nSee https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/livestreamer/BMlxr9wQCkc\nIt would be very useful to have this capability within the core/main release as other forks are behind the main code base. \nNot suggesting necessarily that the patch is appropriate to just go into the main code base as is, but might be a useful starting point.\nAppreciate all your hard work.

I've only saved streams from livestream. Any tips?\n. @VackerSimon That would help a lot, thanks! I'll give it a try on Windows 7 but I'm running it over Parallels on my Mac\n. Ubuntu is on a VPS running ReiserFS, so that could be it, but on Mac I'm trying to write to an ext3 partition and Debian is on extFAT. I do not get any errors, it simply terminates when the file size reaches 2GB. I'm always attempting to fetch live streams from news.livestream.com. I'll try again on Monday with another stream on all systems and post the entire output.\nThanks a lot for the quick replies!\n. @chrippa That makes a lot of sense. If I attempt to download the stream on the browser it creates a 2GB file as well. Thanks a lot for that catch, I tried using hls other times with livestreamer but it didn't work out. I'll try it out on monday with the latest version!\n. It worked with the --stream-types hls option, thanks! Maybe it's something to clarify on livestream.\n. Noticed this issue a month ago, it is not fixed yet.\nhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/860\nDefault quality e.g.best/720p+/480p/360p/akamai cdn have this problem.\nResulting the file lose few segments repeatly, but mobile quality work fine.\nmobile_720p\n\nmobile_360p\n\nbest(720p)\n\n720p+_alt_akamai\n\n. Yes, but not every stream have this option.\n. wrong token\ntoken=deadsoon%%7\n. read in flash memory with winhex for example\n http://stream-recorder.com/forum/cant-play-channel-because-token-t18788.html \n. ok find pid of your flashpluggin and use gdb to debug and Ghex to read file.core created by gdb\nhttp://stream-recorder.com/forum/use-rtmpdump-rtmpsrv-linux-t7661.html\n. hi\n hls joke HD is available\nlivestreamer \"http://www.filmon.com/tv/itv1\"\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin filmon for URL http://www.filmon.com/tv/itv1\nAvailable streams: high (best), high_hls, low (worst), low_hls\n. ISS live stream : http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iss-hdev-payload\n. $ livestreamer -V\nlivestreamer 1.10.2\nis it the lastest ? i tried to install livestreamer with pip but it can only run on root\n. well it seems that the debian package is outdated ?\n. I installed the lastest version with pip and it's working ! thanks\n. I think they started using the player verification, is it possible to post the full url (the one which fetch fragments) along with the cookies by playing the stream on their site. I am trying to make my addon to work too which stopped recently. \n. Looks like those values (except the key-pair-id one) change with each request/invocation. I tested with livestreamer 1.12.2 (latest available on gentoo) but I cannot get it to work by manually inputting the values that it spits out the first time it fails. (because they change with each invocation)\nEDIT2: ignore everything below - I was failling hard.\nExample:\n``` bash\n$ livestreamer --stream-url --http-header 'User-Agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/600.5.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0.5 Safari/600.5.17;

So, they show up okay, but their values are different, except for CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id\nSo much fail in this post, on my side:) I ACK! \n. Just realized that it works fine with youtube-dl   Yields a .mp4\n. One thought - I'm noticing tonight that the plugin is getting 503 errors from picarto due to the Cloudflare DDOS protection mechanism.  Has anyone implemented a Cloudflare work-around in a livestreamer plugin?  Would be handy :)\n. My internet should be fine. I have 100mbps internet and my ping even with it streaming is 60 or lower, which is the norm for me. I stream netflix all the time and have never had an issue before. And, models becoming moving fixed objects in the game isn't a ping issue. I have also never heard of lag causing sound to completely disappear from a game.\n. Thanks for diving into this. As a tl;dr - a workaround is to change line 78 in livestreamer/src/livestreamer/stream/hls_playlist.py from\nbandwidth = int(bandwidth)\nto\nbandwidth = 0 if bandwitdh == 'None' else int(bandwidth)\nEdit: Corrected typo.\n. The code I posted should only be used as a momentary workaround, if at all ;)\nA better patch would be to ignore malformed streams in the playlist and move ahead with the valid ones.

It is strange, i believe continuing to the next entries might be better. \nProbably i will open open a new issue to discuss behaviour of HLS on streamingvideoprovider.\nThere is no issue with EXT-X-STREAM-INF. (mea culpa)\n. Dear @chrippa,\nYou are right! \nIf i want to use rtmpdump in a python project, i must create my own wrapper in order to read contents from rtmpdump process. livestreamer allready does this perfectly.  :+1: \nInstead of reinventing the wheel, writing a plugin for livestreamer seems simpler! (and maybe others will benefit too)\nKepp in mind that the read / write process will be made with python into a named pipe (so no rtmpdump -o- | vlc -)\nThat's why i would like stay will livestreamer.\nOf course i will commit the plugin when is ready.\nThanks.\n. Lets say that we have the following list in an xml file. \nxml\n<streams>\n<stream>\n <name>Stream Name 1</name>\n <icon>Stream Icon 1</icon>\n <uri>rtmp://rtmpStream1  swfUrl=the_sfwUrlN ... live=1</uri>\n</stream>\n...\n<stream>\n <name>Stream Name 2</name>\n <icon>Stream Icon 2</icon>\n <uri>http://www.ustream.tv/StreamChannel2</uri>\n</stream>\n...\n<stream>\n <name>Stream Name N</name>\n <icon>Stream Icon N</icon>\n <uri>rtmp://rtmpStreamN  swfUrl=the_sfwUrlN ... live=1</uri>\n</stream>\n</streams>\nThe xml list is parsed and displayed as a play-list to the user (Enigma2 Plugin http://s7.postimage.org/hwpwkoimz/streamtv_v1_5.jpg). The user chooses a stream from the list. \nLivestreamer currently works with ustream, livestream .. etc. A plugin should be created in order to handle rtmp:// uri.\nHaving the above will help in the following scenarios:\n1. Hard to create plugin for specific sites (eg football live streaming, with many redirects!)\n2. TV Sites that have their own streaming service (this would require creating a parser only for one channel!)\n3. Using rtmp lists from internet\nEdit 1. You see correctly.\ntext\nuser input -> script -> livestreamer -> rtmp-raw plugin -> rtmpdump\n. Great job @chrippa, \nThe StreamURL is great, and easy to expand to other protocol too. \nA nice improvement is to handle the Errors return by the rtmpdump. \nathoik@pc:~$ rtmpdump -r rtmp://91.121.107.131/samiaki/samiaki --live -o- | vlc -\nVLC media player 2.0.3 Twoflower (revision 2.0.2-93-g77aa89e)\nRTMPDump v2.4\n(c) 2010 Andrej Stepanchuk, Howard Chu, The Flvstreamer Team; license: GPL\nConnecting ...\n[0xd56108] main libvlc: Running vlc with the default interface.

Is it getting better?\n``` python\nfrom livestreamer.stream import RTMPStream\nfrom livestreamer.plugins import Plugin, PluginError\nfrom livestreamer.utils import urlget\nimport re\nclass YYCast(Plugin):\n    SWFURL = \"http://cdn.yycast.com/player/player.swf\"\n    PageURL = \"http://www.yycast.com\"\n@classmethod\ndef can_handle_url(self, url):\n    return \"yycast.com\" in url\n\ndef _get_streams(self):\n    playpath = self.url.rstrip(\"/\").rpartition(\"/\")[2].lower()\n\n    self.logger.debug(\"Fetching stream info\")\n    res = urlget(self.url)\n\n    match = re.search(\"'streamer':\\s+'(.+?)'\", res.text)\n    if not match:\n        raise PluginError(\"Unable to find streamer on page\")\n\n    rtmp = match.group(1)\n\n    streams = {}\n\n    streams[\"live\"] = RTMPStream(self.session, {\n        \"rtmp\": rtmp,\n        \"pageUrl\": self.PageURL,\n        \"swfVfy\": self.SWFURL,\n        \"playpath\" : playpath,\n        \"live\": True\n        }, redirect=True)\n\n    return streams\n\nplugin = YYCast\n```\n. Ooops you are right.. \nNow i have to learn the git commands...\nI think i messed up things with the git rebase command! \n. Thanks @chrippa,\nI used the following command to remove all useless commits.\ngit push -f origin HEAD^:master\nNext time i will try the soft reset. \nHave a nice day\n. fixed ;)\n. Well done @chrippa!\nTesting HDS from Greek Channels i notice that the following stream works perfectly:\nhds://http://alfakanali-lh.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@90368/manifest.f4m (Alpha)\nBut this one makes small freezes on my Enigma2 STB every few seconds (probably every time a new chunk is downloaded, on my computer there is no problem):\nhds://http://btslive-lh.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@87036/manifest.f4m (Kydon)\nThe Enigma2 STB's have limited resources (memory and cpu). How can i help making better HDS usage on Enigma2 STB's?\nOnce again thanks for the great code you are sharing with us.\nEdit1.  This one almost crashes my computer.\nhds://http://enikosflashhd-f.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@36174/manifest.f4m (enikos)\n. > AFAIK no video player can play the raw fragments, so I need to convert the stream to FLV first. Unfortunately my FLV library is not very optimized yet, so the CPU usage is a bit higher than I like it to be right now.\nDo you believe we can tune the FLV conversion? (by using shifts etc etc)\nAlso @K-S-V on his php implementation uses the same technique? (it seems yes)\nFinally something is really wrong with that stream hds://http://enikosflashhd-f.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@36174/manifest.f4m. All available memory and swap is consumed after a while.\nathoik@pc:/tmp$ livestreamer hds://http://enikosflashhd-f.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@36174/manifest.f4m best -l debug\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin stream for URL hds://http://enikosflashhd-f.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@36174/manifest.f4m\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 800k\n[stream.hds][debug] Starting buffer filler thread\n[stream.hds][debug] Updating bootstrap\n[stream.hds][debug] Current segment: -1\n[stream.hds][debug] Current fragment: 0\n[stream.hds][debug] Max fragments: 222636663\n[stream.hds][debug] Last fragment: 222636663\n^CKilled\n\nEdit1.

Maybe there is a limitation on IP addresses. \nWhen i am trying to open this stream the only output i am getting is the one i posted and memory is keep rising.\nWhere do you want me to enable debug messages in order to spot this error?\nEdit1. Maybe VLC is able to play raw H264 using  parameter --demux h264? \nhttp://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=92357\nEdit2. This line is causing the error.

Using cProfile and gprof2dot ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/582336/how-can-you-profile-a-python-script )\n\nUsing pycallgraph (and very very big screen..)\n\nIn both cases serialize and deserialize are the most consuming operations.\n. > Yes, I saw that too, but these functions simply call alot of read_xx or write_xx functions and I don't know what I can do to make those functions any more efficient. :-/\nMaybe using a batch of read or write? Eg instead of calling read X times we can use the following: Struct(\"B\" * X )\nAlso maybe using pre-allocated Buffers with pack_into() and upack_from() would further optimize.\nMaybe we can optimize constact ranges. Eg replace range(3) with (0, 1, 2).\n. A small tune is to use cStringIO instead of StringIO.\npython\n-    from StringIO import StringIO as BytesIO\n+    from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO\n```\nwith cStringIO\npython -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1787905 function calls (1647483 primitive calls) in 5.971 seconds\npython -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1787905 function calls (1647483 primitive calls) in 5.610 seconds\nwith StringIO\npython -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         2136601 function calls (1996179 primitive calls) in 6.533 seconds\npython -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         2136601 function calls (1996179 primitive calls) in 6.546 seconds\n```\n. Dear @chrippa, \nI believe it is possible to tune the read, write functions. \nFirst, BytesIO is available to python2 and seems to produce better results than cStringIO. So probably we can use it.\n```\nwith cStringIO\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1787905 function calls (1647483 primitive calls) in 5.569 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1787905 function calls (1647483 primitive calls) in 5.542 seconds\nwith BytesIO\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1779869 function calls (1639447 primitive calls) in 5.556 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1779869 function calls (1639447 primitive calls) in 5.572 seconds\n```\nThen creating a buffer on write functions seems to improve performance too. Eg tag _serialize can be written in the following way. We must create the get_XX functions that return the packed data instead of writing them.\n``` python\n# packet.py class PacketIO\ndef get_u8(self, num):\n    return self.struct.U8.pack(int(num))\n\n# tag.py class Tag\ndef _serialize(self, packet, strict=True):\n    buf = b\"\"\n    buf += packet.get_u8(self.flags.byte)\n    buf += packet.get_u24(self.data_size)\n    buf += packet.get_s32e(self.timestamp)\n    buf += packet.get_u24(self.streamid)\n    packet.write(buf)\n\n```\nAdding write buffer both function calls and primitive calls are dropping.\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1709989 function calls (1569567 primitive calls) in 5.405 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1709989 function calls (1569567 primitive calls) in 5.417 seconds\nAnother tune is to read data at once when it is possible. We must create the set_XX functions where they unpack data.\n``` python\n# packet.py class PacketIO\ndef set_u8(self, u8):\n    try:\n        ret = self.struct.U8.unpack(u8)[0]\n    except struct.error:\n        raise IOError\n\n# tag.py class FrameData\ndef _deserialize(cls, io):\n    buf = io.read()\n    typ = io.set_u8(buf[0])\n    data = buf[1:]\n\n    return cls(typ, data)\n\n# tag.py class AVCVideoData\n@classmethod\ndef _deserialize(cls, io):\n    buf = io.read()\n    typ = io.set_u8(buf[0])\n    composition_time = io.set_s24(buf[1] + buf[2] + buf[3])\n    data = buf[4:]\n\n    return cls(typ, composition_time, data)\n\n # box.py class FragmentRunEntry\n@classmethod\ndef _deserialize(cls, io):\n    buf = io.read(4 + 8 + 4)\n    first_fragment = io.set_u32(buf[0:4])\n    first_fragment_timestamp = io.set_u64(buf[4:12])\n    fragment_duration = io.set_u32(buf[12:16])\n\n    if fragment_duration == 0:\n        discontinuity_indicator = io.read_u8()\n    else:\n        discontinuity_indicator = None\n\n    return cls(first_fragment, first_fragment_timestamp,\n               fragment_duration, discontinuity_indicator)\n\n# testHDS2.py class Frame\n@classmethod\ndef _deserialize(cls, io):\n    buf = io.read(1 + 3 + 4 + 3)\n    if len(buf) < 11:\n        raise IOError\n    type_ = io.set_u8(buf[0])\n    size = io.set_u24(buf[1] + buf[2] + buf[3])\n    timestamp = io.set_s32e(buf[4] + buf[5] + buf[6] + buf[7])\n    n = io.set_u24(buf[8] + buf[9] + buf[10])\n\n    io.data_left = size\n\n    if type_ in TagDataTypes:\n        data = TagDataTypes[type_].deserialize(io=io)\n    else:\n        data = io.read(size)\n        data = RawData(data)\n\n    io.data_left = None\n    last_tag_size = io.read_u32()\n\n    return cls(type_, size, timestamp, data)\n\n```\nUsing the above technique both function calls and primitive calls are dropping even further.\n$ python -m cProfile  testHDS2.py ...\n         1216172 function calls (1153130 primitive calls) in 3.986 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile  testHDS2.py ...\n         1216172 function calls (1153130 primitive calls) in 4.019 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile  testHDS2.py ...\n         1216172 function calls (1153130 primitive calls) in 4.046 seconds\nI hope you like those ideas and soon find their way in python-flashmedia.\n. Well done,\nI would like to see those improvements when they will be released.

(maybe something changed in the rtmpdump parameters, will check soon). \n``` python\nfrom livestreamer.stream import RTMPStream, HLSStream\nfrom livestreamer.plugins import Plugin, PluginError, NoStreamsError\nfrom livestreamer.utils import urlget\nfrom time import time\nimport re\nclass Livestation(Plugin):\n    SWFURL = \"http://beta.cdn.livestation.com/player/5.10/livestation-player.swf\"\n    APIURL = \"http://tokens.api.livestation.com/channels/{0}/tokens.json?{1}\"\n@classmethod\ndef can_handle_url(self, url):\n    return \"livestation.com\" in url\n\ndef _get_rtmp_streams(self, text):\n    match = re.search(\"streamer=(rtmp://.+?)&\", text)\n    if not match:\n        raise PluginError((\"No RTMP streamer found on URL {0}\").format(self.url))\n\n    rtmp = match.group(1)\n\n    match = re.search(\"<meta content=\\\"(.+)\\\" name=\\\"item-id\\\" />\", text)\n    if not match:\n        raise PluginError((\"Missing channel item-id on URL {0}\").format(self.url))\n\n    res = urlget(self.APIURL.format(match.group(1), time()), params=dict(output=\"json\"))\n\n    if not isinstance(res.json, list):\n        raise PluginError(\"Stream info response is not JSON\")\n\n    rtmplist = {}\n\n    for jdata in res.json:\n        if \"stream_name\" not in jdata or \"type\" not in jdata:\n            continue\n\n        if \"rtmp\" not in jdata[\"type\"]:\n            continue\n\n        playpath = jdata[\"stream_name\"]\n\n        if \"token\" in jdata and jdata[\"token\"]:\n            playpath += jdata[\"token\"]\n\n        if len(res.json) == 1:\n            stream_name = \"live\"\n        else:\n            stream_name = jdata[\"stream_name\"]\n\n        rtmplist[stream_name] = RTMPStream(self.session, {\n            \"rtmp\": rtmp,\n            \"pageUrl\": self.url,\n            \"swfVfy\": self.SWFURL,\n            \"playpath\": playpath,\n            \"live\": True\n        })\n\n    return rtmplist\n\ndef _get_hls_streams(self, text):\n    match = re.search(\"\\\"(http://.+\\.m3u8)\\\"\", text)\n    if not match:\n        raise PluginError((\"No HLS playlist found on URL {0}\").format(self.url))\n\n    playlisturl = match.group(1)\n    self.logger.debug(\"Playlist URL is {0}\", playlisturl)\n    playlist = {}\n\n    try:\n        playlist = HLSStream.parse_variant_playlist(self.session, playlisturl)\n    except IOError as err:\n        raise PluginError(err)\n\n    return playlist\n\ndef _get_streams(self):\n    res = urlget(self.url)\n    streams = {}\n\n    if RTMPStream.is_usable(self.session):\n        try:\n            rtmpstreams = self._get_rtmp_streams(res.text)\n            streams.update(rtmpstreams)\n        except PluginError as err:\n            self.logger.error(\"Error when fetching RTMP stream info: {0}\", str(err))\n    else:\n        self.logger.warning(\"rtmpdump is not usable, only HLS streams will be available\")\n\n    try:\n        hlsstreams = self._get_hls_streams(res.text)\n        streams.update(hlsstreams)\n    except PluginError as err:\n        self.logger.error(\"Error when fetching HLS stream info: {0}\", str(err))\n\n    return streams\n\nplugin = Livestation\n```\n. Thanks\n. Thanks\n. Yes, the RTMP streams containing the @ sign, sometimes failed on my tests. I thought that something was wrong with the @ sign.\n. Yes, having the best open source library, you can extend it as you like :+1:  \nI made another try with twisted.

Dear @hugolp,\nThe above code (twisted) works on the tests performed with vlc.\nYou can use if you like!\nPlease share your ideas and / or your code on a new github project.\nGood luck.\n. Put the above code into a file (eg testme.py) and then run python testme.py. \nThen point vlc eg to localhost:8080/?url=THE_URL&stream=QUALITY.\nThe url must be url encoded. Quality can be best or empty (will use best when empty).\n. Probably self.stream.buffer is None after the latest changes. \ntext\nathoik@pc:/tmp$ python test.py\nReopening Stream  <livestreamer.stream.hls.HLSStream object at 0x1ce0a10>\nException in thread Thread-1:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 551, in __bootstrap_inner\n    self.run()\n  File \"/home/athoik/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/livestreamer-1.4-py2.7.egg/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\", line 127, in run\n    self.download_sequence(entry)\n  File \"/home/athoik/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/livestreamer-1.4-py2.7.egg/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\", line 119, in download_sequence\n    self.stream.buffer.write(chunk)\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write'\nEdit 1.

Using the following channel as an example:\nhttp://www.azubu.tv/channel/live_small.do?cn_id=2226828736001&vod_id=\nFound the following link that works in VLC:\nhttp://azubuhdlive-lh.akamaihd.net/SKPsiyo_1_1800@78010?videoId=2226828736001&lineUpId=&pubId=&playerId=&affiliateId=&v=2.11.3&fp=&r=&g=\nSo probably they are using HTTP stream.\n. Dear @chrippa,\nAlso this URL does not work http://www.ustream.tv/channel/\u0391\u03c1\u03c4-tv with livestreamer. Probably they are using something different on those channels.\n. In order to build rtmp into Livestreamer we need amf and rtmp protocol and rtmpclient\nrtmplite is one implementation (but don't know if they are Python 3 compatible)\nhttp://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/source/browse/trunk/amf.py\nhttp://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/source/browse/trunk/rtmp.py\nhttp://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/source/browse/trunk/rtmpclient.py\nrtmp-python + PyAMF is another implementation (but don't know if they are Python 3 compatible)\nhttps://github.com/hydralabs/pyamf\nhttps://github.com/prekageo/rtmp-python/blob/master/rtmp_protocol.py\nhttps://github.com/prekageo/rtmp-python/blob/master/sample_rtmp_client.py\npython-flashmedia is your implementation and since https://github.com/chrippa/python-flashmedia/commit/95da34a10c52072240aa8e9cb8d3babfa3479553 there is some progress (from you of course) adding AMF 3.\nMaybe add the missing AMF parts into python-flashmedia? \nEdit1. Using librtmp from python is it possible to use API? (eg https://gist.github.com/athoik/5484842 ) \n.

Probably livestreamer cannot handle directly the  HLS from ustream.tv because there are using the #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY tag.\nDownloading the playlist is like this:\n``` m3u8\nEXTM3U\nEXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:NO\nEXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6\nEXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0\nEXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:EVENT\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nEXTINF:6,\nhttp://cdn1.ustream.tv/preroll/preroll3.ts?n=1371405952\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\n```\nThen downloading the playlist with hls:// we are getting #PROGRESSED tag.\n``` m3u8\nEXTM3U\nEXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:NO\nEXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6\nEXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0\nEXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:EVENT\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nEXTINF:6,\nhttp://cdn1.ustream.tv/preroll/preroll3.ts?n=1371405991\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nPROGRESSED 50%\n```\nAnd then we are getting the following m3u8 witch is opening with hlsvariant:// not with hls://\n``` m3u8\nEXTM3U\nEXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:NO\nEXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6\nEXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0\nEXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:EVENT\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nEXTINF:6,\nhttp://cdn1.ustream.tv/preroll/preroll3.ts?n=1371405910\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nEXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=146054,CODECS=\"avc1.77.13, mp4a.40.2\",RESOLUTION=320x240\nhttp://iphone-streaming.ustream.tv/sjc-uhls02/uhls/12548227/streams/live_3/iphone/playlist.m3u8\n```\nProbably we need to handle reload of playlist using variant parsing when tag #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY exists.\nSome info of #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY tag are here: Technical Note TN2288\n. Actually there is a solution here\nOpening the following link the playlist is starting #PROGRESSED immediatelly.\nhttp://iphone-streaming.ustream.tv/uhls/%s/streams/live/iphone/playlist.m3u8?appType=11&appVersion=2\n. My intention was not to download them, but to see them on platform without flash player.\nJust comment the check will be enough (for me)...\n``` python\nif not \"live_playback\" in args or args[\"live_playback\"] == \"0\":\nraise NoStreamsError(self.url)\n```\nThanks.\n. That would be nice! I will leave this ticket open as a feature request. \n. Dear @chrippa ,\nPlease take a look at the following patch. The idea is to have the Session object in Livestreamer class. Then when we are calling the urlget we must add the session part. It is not done automatically because urlget does not know the class Livestreamer. \nUsing the HLSStream with the changes below session is ok.\n``` patch\ndiff --git a/src/livestreamer/session.py b/src/livestreamer/session.py\nindex d4ad9d6..40455ec 100644\n--- a/src/livestreamer/session.py\n+++ b/src/livestreamer/session.py\n@@ -6,6 +6,7 @@ from .options import Options\nimport pkgutil\n import imp\n+import requests\n import sys\n import traceback\n@@ -48,6 +49,7 @@ class Livestreamer(object):\n         })\n         self.plugins = {}\n         self.logger = Logger()\n+        self.rsession = requests.Session()\n         self.load_builtin_plugins()\n def set_option(self, key, value):\n\ndiff --git a/src/livestreamer/stream/hls.py b/src/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\nindex 66844a8..89c7b87 100644\n--- a/src/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\n+++ b/src/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\n@@ -97,7 +97,7 @@ class HLSStreamFiller(Thread):\n     def download_sequence(self, entry):\n         try:\n             res = urlget(entry[\"url\"], stream=True,\n-                         exception=IOError)\n+                         session=self.stream.session.rsession, exception=IOError)\n         except IOError as err:\n             self.stream.logger.error(\"Failed to open sequence {0}: {1}\",\n                                      entry[\"sequence\"], str(err))\n@@ -233,7 +233,7 @@ class HLSStreamIO(io.IOBase):\n         self.logger.debug(\"Reloading playlist\")\n         self.playlist_reload_time = time()\n\nres = urlget(self.url, exception=IOError)\n\nres = urlget(self.url, session=self.session.rsession, exception=IOError)\n try:\n     (tags, entries) = parse_m3u(res.text)\n\n@@ -257,7 +257,7 @@ class HLSStreamIO(io.IOBase):\n         if not \"URI\" in tags[\"EXT-X-KEY\"][0]:\n             raise StreamError(\"Missing URI to decryption key\")\n\n\nres = urlget(tags[\"EXT-X-KEY\"][0][\"URI\"], exception=StreamError)\n\n\nres = urlget(tags[\"EXT-X-KEY\"][0][\"URI\"], session=self.session.rsession, exception=StreamError)\n             self.decryptor_key = res.content\n for i, entry in enumerate(entries):\n\n@@ -347,7 +347,7 @@ class HLSStream(Stream):\n @classmethod\n def parse_variant_playlist(cls, session, url, namekey=\"name\",\n                            nameprefix=\"\", params):\n-        res = urlget(url, exception=IOError, params)\n+        res = urlget(url, session=session.rsession, exception=IOError, **params)\n     streams = {}\n try:\n\ndiff --git a/src/livestreamer/utils.py b/src/livestreamer/utils.py\nindex 3bc5940..957986c 100644\n--- a/src/livestreamer/utils.py\n+++ b/src/livestreamer/utils.py\n@@ -34,12 +34,12 @@ def urlopen(url, method=\"get\", exception=PluginError, session=None,\nreturn res\n\n\n-def urlget(url, stream=False, args, kw):\n-    return urlopen(url, method=\"get\", stream=stream,\n+def urlget(url, stream=False, session=None, *args, kw):\n+    return urlopen(url, method=\"get\", session=session, stream=stream, \n                    args, **kw)\n-def urlresolve(url):\n-    res = urlget(url, stream=True, allow_redirects=False)\n+def urlresolve(url, session=None):\n+    res = urlget(url, stream=True, session=session, allow_redirects=False)\n if res.status_code == 302 and \"location\" in res.headers:\n     return res.headers[\"location\"]\n\n-- \n```\n.

Hi, \nHere is a working plugin for Livestreamer: https://gist.github.com/athoik/9918293\nTest URL: http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv173117558?ref=top&zroute=index \n. I did not try other streams :/ only main screen.\nSo special RTMP probably required, unless they switched to different provider. \n. Hello,\nI don't have a stream from Mips in order to test it. @K-S-V modifications can be found here: http://stream-recorder.com/forum/customized-rtmpdump-binaries-patch-file-t16103.html\n. Hello \nWeeb plugin requires @K-S-V rtmpdump. \nOriginal code was also from @K-S-V  https://github.com/K-S-V/Scripts/blob/master/WeebTV.php \nI don't see any change on the script the last 5 months. I'll check it when have time (probably weekend).\n. It seems you get data now by posting channel_id and quality to\nhttp://www.filmon.com/ajax/getChannelInfo\n@karlo2105, please feel free to provide a patch.\n2013/11/1 karlo2105 notifications@github.com\n\nFilmon plugin is broken.\n%systemdrive%\\progra~1\\livestreamer\\livestreamer \"\nhttp://www.filmon.com/tv/france-2\"\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin filmon for URL\nhttp://www.filmon.com/tv/france-2\nerror: Invalid JSON response\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/200#issuecomment-27564402\n.\n. There are no streams available to http://www.9stream.com/channels\n\nPublic (0)        Private (0)\nSo i guess they stop broadcasting.\n. Use no_proxy  environment variable.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/16067534/only-use-a-proxy-for-certain-git-urls-domains\nEdit1. Ooops it is only for git, probably it wont work with requests\nEdit2. It seems after all that no_proxy is working for requests (>1.2) too. https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/879\n. Indeed, namekey=\"bitrate\" did the job. \nAvailable streams: 1153k, 2180k (best), 691k (worst)\nThanks!\n. Anyone knows if this script https://github.com/K-S-V/Scripts/blob/master/BeatConvert.php is related with be-at.tv?\n. Actually BeatConvert related with be-at.tv. It seems that be-at.tv uses a custom protocol, every 12 seconds it requests a beat file. Downloader seems easy, but decrypting beat files.. well i dont know how easy can be.\n.

There more improvement ofc but at least is a good start.\n. I've made some changes here : https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358\nNow it works for live streams also.\n. I've made another change that might cause the above message. Try with latest version from here: https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358\n. There was a missing close in the loop. Try again with latest https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358/revisions\n. Dear @chrippa,\nCan you have a look https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358\nMaybe there is further tuning, eg use the FLVContact or use Tag etc?\n. Dear @chrippa, \nThanks for the suggestions, most of the issues solved. ~~I did use FLVTagConcat without modifications (so there is room for further improvements, like override the iter_tags).~~\n~~Is it necessary to override iter_tags or its good enough for inclusion?~~\nEdit1. iter_tags was overridden\n. Changing audio_tag = b\"\" and video_tag = b\"\" with continue should fix it.\n. @chrippa, well your knowledge in FLV is great! I made changes here but above doesn't work for version 1 streams. \nIn version 1 there is no video and audio tagging (i think so), so how this can be done?\n. And you are right once again :+1:  \nRawData did the job. https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358/revisions\nHere is a version 1 url: http://www.be-at.tv/brands/coco-maya/viva-warriors/detlef\n. Thanks @chrippa, it was great learning all those new things :)\n. Could you please make a function for check http date into utils?\nBecause not every machine has email.utils package, especially in embedded machines.\npython\n            # Only save in cache if a valid date is given\n            if email.utils.parsedate(modified):\nWhen email.utils is not available it can check date using datetime as a failback..\npython\ndatetime.strptime(modified, '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT')\nWhat do you think?\n.

I did already the change on the plugin. Soon i will fork in order to push it properly. :)\n. It is strange, i believe continuing to the next entries might be better. \nProbably i will open open a new issue to discuss behaviour of HLS on streamingvideoprovider.\nThere is no issue with EXT-X-STREAM-INF. (mea culpa)\n. Dear @chrippa,\nYou are right! \nIf i want to use rtmpdump in a python project, i must create my own wrapper in order to read contents from rtmpdump process. livestreamer allready does this perfectly.  :+1: \nInstead of reinventing the wheel, writing a plugin for livestreamer seems simpler! (and maybe others will benefit too)\nKepp in mind that the read / write process will be made with python into a named pipe (so no rtmpdump -o- | vlc -)\nThat's why i would like stay will livestreamer.\nOf course i will commit the plugin when is ready.\nThanks.\n. Lets say that we have the following list in an xml file. \nxml\n<streams>\n<stream>\n <name>Stream Name 1</name>\n <icon>Stream Icon 1</icon>\n <uri>rtmp://rtmpStream1  swfUrl=the_sfwUrlN ... live=1</uri>\n</stream>\n...\n<stream>\n <name>Stream Name 2</name>\n <icon>Stream Icon 2</icon>\n <uri>http://www.ustream.tv/StreamChannel2</uri>\n</stream>\n...\n<stream>\n <name>Stream Name N</name>\n <icon>Stream Icon N</icon>\n <uri>rtmp://rtmpStreamN  swfUrl=the_sfwUrlN ... live=1</uri>\n</stream>\n</streams>\nThe xml list is parsed and displayed as a play-list to the user (Enigma2 Plugin http://s7.postimage.org/hwpwkoimz/streamtv_v1_5.jpg). The user chooses a stream from the list. \nLivestreamer currently works with ustream, livestream .. etc. A plugin should be created in order to handle rtmp:// uri.\nHaving the above will help in the following scenarios:\n1. Hard to create plugin for specific sites (eg football live streaming, with many redirects!)\n2. TV Sites that have their own streaming service (this would require creating a parser only for one channel!)\n3. Using rtmp lists from internet\nEdit 1. You see correctly.\ntext\nuser input -> script -> livestreamer -> rtmp-raw plugin -> rtmpdump\n. Great job @chrippa, \nThe StreamURL is great, and easy to expand to other protocol too. \nA nice improvement is to handle the Errors return by the rtmpdump. \nathoik@pc:~$ rtmpdump -r rtmp://91.121.107.131/samiaki/samiaki --live -o- | vlc -\nVLC media player 2.0.3 Twoflower (revision 2.0.2-93-g77aa89e)\nRTMPDump v2.4\n(c) 2010 Andrej Stepanchuk, Howard Chu, The Flvstreamer Team; license: GPL\nConnecting ...\n[0xd56108] main libvlc: Running vlc with the default interface.

Ooops you are right.. \nNow i have to learn the git commands...\nI think i messed up things with the git rebase command! \n. Thanks @chrippa,\nI used the following command to remove all useless commits.\ngit push -f origin HEAD^:master\nNext time i will try the soft reset. \nHave a nice day\n. fixed ;)\n. Well done @chrippa!\nTesting HDS from Greek Channels i notice that the following stream works perfectly:\nhds://http://alfakanali-lh.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@90368/manifest.f4m (Alpha)\nBut this one makes small freezes on my Enigma2 STB every few seconds (probably every time a new chunk is downloaded, on my computer there is no problem):\nhds://http://btslive-lh.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@87036/manifest.f4m (Kydon)\nThe Enigma2 STB's have limited resources (memory and cpu). How can i help making better HDS usage on Enigma2 STB's?\nOnce again thanks for the great code you are sharing with us.\nEdit1.  This one almost crashes my computer.\nhds://http://enikosflashhd-f.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@36174/manifest.f4m (enikos)\n. > AFAIK no video player can play the raw fragments, so I need to convert the stream to FLV first. Unfortunately my FLV library is not very optimized yet, so the CPU usage is a bit higher than I like it to be right now.\nDo you believe we can tune the FLV conversion? (by using shifts etc etc)\nAlso @K-S-V on his php implementation uses the same technique? (it seems yes)\nFinally something is really wrong with that stream hds://http://enikosflashhd-f.akamaihd.net/z/live_1@36174/manifest.f4m.

Using cProfile and gprof2dot ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/582336/how-can-you-profile-a-python-script )\n\nUsing pycallgraph (and very very big screen..)\n\nIn both cases serialize and deserialize are the most consuming operations.\n. > Yes, I saw that too, but these functions simply call alot of read_xx or write_xx functions and I don't know what I can do to make those functions any more efficient. :-/\nMaybe using a batch of read or write? Eg instead of calling read X times we can use the following: Struct(\"B\" * X )\nAlso maybe using pre-allocated Buffers with pack_into() and upack_from() would further optimize.\nMaybe we can optimize constact ranges. Eg replace range(3) with (0, 1, 2).\n. A small tune is to use cStringIO instead of StringIO.\npython\n-    from StringIO import StringIO as BytesIO\n+    from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO\n```\nwith cStringIO\npython -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1787905 function calls (1647483 primitive calls) in 5.971 seconds\npython -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1787905 function calls (1647483 primitive calls) in 5.610 seconds\nwith StringIO\npython -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         2136601 function calls (1996179 primitive calls) in 6.533 seconds\npython -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         2136601 function calls (1996179 primitive calls) in 6.546 seconds\n```\n. Dear @chrippa, \nI believe it is possible to tune the read, write functions. \nFirst, BytesIO is available to python2 and seems to produce better results than cStringIO. So probably we can use it.\n```\nwith cStringIO\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1787905 function calls (1647483 primitive calls) in 5.569 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1787905 function calls (1647483 primitive calls) in 5.542 seconds\nwith BytesIO\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1779869 function calls (1639447 primitive calls) in 5.556 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1779869 function calls (1639447 primitive calls) in 5.572 seconds\n```\nThen creating a buffer on write functions seems to improve performance too. Eg tag _serialize can be written in the following way. We must create the get_XX functions that return the packed data instead of writing them.\n``` python\n# packet.py class PacketIO\ndef get_u8(self, num):\n    return self.struct.U8.pack(int(num))\n\n# tag.py class Tag\ndef _serialize(self, packet, strict=True):\n    buf = b\"\"\n    buf += packet.get_u8(self.flags.byte)\n    buf += packet.get_u24(self.data_size)\n    buf += packet.get_s32e(self.timestamp)\n    buf += packet.get_u24(self.streamid)\n    packet.write(buf)\n\n```\nAdding write buffer both function calls and primitive calls are dropping.\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1709989 function calls (1569567 primitive calls) in 5.405 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile testHDS.py ...\n         1709989 function calls (1569567 primitive calls) in 5.417 seconds\nAnother tune is to read data at once when it is possible. We must create the set_XX functions where they unpack data.\n``` python\n# packet.py class PacketIO\ndef set_u8(self, u8):\n    try:\n        ret = self.struct.U8.unpack(u8)[0]\n    except struct.error:\n        raise IOError\n\n# tag.py class FrameData\ndef _deserialize(cls, io):\n    buf = io.read()\n    typ = io.set_u8(buf[0])\n    data = buf[1:]\n\n    return cls(typ, data)\n\n# tag.py class AVCVideoData\n@classmethod\ndef _deserialize(cls, io):\n    buf = io.read()\n    typ = io.set_u8(buf[0])\n    composition_time = io.set_s24(buf[1] + buf[2] + buf[3])\n    data = buf[4:]\n\n    return cls(typ, composition_time, data)\n\n # box.py class FragmentRunEntry\n@classmethod\ndef _deserialize(cls, io):\n    buf = io.read(4 + 8 + 4)\n    first_fragment = io.set_u32(buf[0:4])\n    first_fragment_timestamp = io.set_u64(buf[4:12])\n    fragment_duration = io.set_u32(buf[12:16])\n\n    if fragment_duration == 0:\n        discontinuity_indicator = io.read_u8()\n    else:\n        discontinuity_indicator = None\n\n    return cls(first_fragment, first_fragment_timestamp,\n               fragment_duration, discontinuity_indicator)\n\n# testHDS2.py class Frame\n@classmethod\ndef _deserialize(cls, io):\n    buf = io.read(1 + 3 + 4 + 3)\n    if len(buf) < 11:\n        raise IOError\n    type_ = io.set_u8(buf[0])\n    size = io.set_u24(buf[1] + buf[2] + buf[3])\n    timestamp = io.set_s32e(buf[4] + buf[5] + buf[6] + buf[7])\n    n = io.set_u24(buf[8] + buf[9] + buf[10])\n\n    io.data_left = size\n\n    if type_ in TagDataTypes:\n        data = TagDataTypes[type_].deserialize(io=io)\n    else:\n        data = io.read(size)\n        data = RawData(data)\n\n    io.data_left = None\n    last_tag_size = io.read_u32()\n\n    return cls(type_, size, timestamp, data)\n\n```\nUsing the above technique both function calls and primitive calls are dropping even further.\n$ python -m cProfile  testHDS2.py ...\n         1216172 function calls (1153130 primitive calls) in 3.986 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile  testHDS2.py ...\n         1216172 function calls (1153130 primitive calls) in 4.019 seconds\n$ python -m cProfile  testHDS2.py ...\n         1216172 function calls (1153130 primitive calls) in 4.046 seconds\nI hope you like those ideas and soon find their way in python-flashmedia.\n. Well done,\nI would like to see those improvements when they will be released.

Dear @hugolp,\nThe above code (twisted) works on the tests performed with vlc.\nYou can use if you like!\nPlease share your ideas and / or your code on a new github project.\nGood luck.\n. Put the above code into a file (eg testme.py) and then run python testme.py. \nThen point vlc eg to localhost:8080/?url=THE_URL&stream=QUALITY.\nThe url must be url encoded. Quality can be best or empty (will use best when empty).\n. Probably self.stream.buffer is None after the latest changes. \ntext\nathoik@pc:/tmp$ python test.py\nReopening Stream  <livestreamer.stream.hls.HLSStream object at 0x1ce0a10>\nException in thread Thread-1:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 551, in __bootstrap_inner\n    self.run()\n  File \"/home/athoik/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/livestreamer-1.4-py2.7.egg/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\", line 127, in run\n    self.download_sequence(entry)\n  File \"/home/athoik/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/livestreamer-1.4-py2.7.egg/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\", line 119, in download_sequence\n    self.stream.buffer.write(chunk)\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write'\nEdit 1.

Dear @chrippa,\nAlso this URL does not work http://www.ustream.tv/channel/\u0391\u03c1\u03c4-tv with livestreamer. Probably they are using something different on those channels.\n. In order to build rtmp into Livestreamer we need amf and rtmp protocol and rtmpclient\nrtmplite is one implementation (but don't know if they are Python 3 compatible)\nhttp://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/source/browse/trunk/amf.py\nhttp://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/source/browse/trunk/rtmp.py\nhttp://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/source/browse/trunk/rtmpclient.py\nrtmp-python + PyAMF is another implementation (but don't know if they are Python 3 compatible)\nhttps://github.com/hydralabs/pyamf\nhttps://github.com/prekageo/rtmp-python/blob/master/rtmp_protocol.py\nhttps://github.com/prekageo/rtmp-python/blob/master/sample_rtmp_client.py\npython-flashmedia is your implementation and since https://github.com/chrippa/python-flashmedia/commit/95da34a10c52072240aa8e9cb8d3babfa3479553 there is some progress (from you of course) adding AMF 3.\nMaybe add the missing AMF parts into python-flashmedia? \nEdit1. Using librtmp from python is it possible to use API? (eg https://gist.github.com/athoik/5484842 ) \n.

Probably livestreamer cannot handle directly the  HLS from ustream.tv because there are using the #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY tag.\nDownloading the playlist is like this:\n``` m3u8\nEXTM3U\nEXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:NO\nEXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6\nEXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0\nEXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:EVENT\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nEXTINF:6,\nhttp://cdn1.ustream.tv/preroll/preroll3.ts?n=1371405952\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\n```\nThen downloading the playlist with hls:// we are getting #PROGRESSED tag.\n``` m3u8\nEXTM3U\nEXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:NO\nEXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6\nEXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0\nEXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:EVENT\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nEXTINF:6,\nhttp://cdn1.ustream.tv/preroll/preroll3.ts?n=1371405991\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nPROGRESSED 50%\n```\nAnd then we are getting the following m3u8 witch is opening with hlsvariant:// not with hls://\n``` m3u8\nEXTM3U\nEXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:NO\nEXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6\nEXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0\nEXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:EVENT\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nEXTINF:6,\nhttp://cdn1.ustream.tv/preroll/preroll3.ts?n=1371405910\nEXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\nEXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=146054,CODECS=\"avc1.77.13, mp4a.40.2\",RESOLUTION=320x240\nhttp://iphone-streaming.ustream.tv/sjc-uhls02/uhls/12548227/streams/live_3/iphone/playlist.m3u8\n```\nProbably we need to handle reload of playlist using variant parsing when tag #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY exists.\nSome info of #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY tag are here: Technical Note TN2288\n. Actually there is a solution here\nOpening the following link the playlist is starting #PROGRESSED immediatelly.\nhttp://iphone-streaming.ustream.tv/uhls/%s/streams/live/iphone/playlist.m3u8?appType=11&appVersion=2\n. My intention was not to download them, but to see them on platform without flash player.\nJust comment the check will be enough (for me)...\n``` python\nif not \"live_playback\" in args or args[\"live_playback\"] == \"0\":\nraise NoStreamsError(self.url)\n```\nThanks.\n. That would be nice! I will leave this ticket open as a feature request. \n. Dear @chrippa ,\nPlease take a look at the following patch. The idea is to have the Session object in Livestreamer class. Then when we are calling the urlget we must add the session part. It is not done automatically because urlget does not know the class Livestreamer. \nUsing the HLSStream with the changes below session is ok.\n``` patch\ndiff --git a/src/livestreamer/session.py b/src/livestreamer/session.py\nindex d4ad9d6..40455ec 100644\n--- a/src/livestreamer/session.py\n+++ b/src/livestreamer/session.py\n@@ -6,6 +6,7 @@ from .options import Options\nimport pkgutil\n import imp\n+import requests\n import sys\n import traceback\n@@ -48,6 +49,7 @@ class Livestreamer(object):\n         })\n         self.plugins = {}\n         self.logger = Logger()\n+        self.rsession = requests.Session()\n         self.load_builtin_plugins()\n def set_option(self, key, value):\n\ndiff --git a/src/livestreamer/stream/hls.py b/src/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\nindex 66844a8..89c7b87 100644\n--- a/src/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\n+++ b/src/livestreamer/stream/hls.py\n@@ -97,7 +97,7 @@ class HLSStreamFiller(Thread):\n     def download_sequence(self, entry):\n         try:\n             res = urlget(entry[\"url\"], stream=True,\n-                         exception=IOError)\n+                         session=self.stream.session.rsession, exception=IOError)\n         except IOError as err:\n             self.stream.logger.error(\"Failed to open sequence {0}: {1}\",\n                                      entry[\"sequence\"], str(err))\n@@ -233,7 +233,7 @@ class HLSStreamIO(io.IOBase):\n         self.logger.debug(\"Reloading playlist\")\n         self.playlist_reload_time = time()\n\nres = urlget(self.url, exception=IOError)\n\nres = urlget(self.url, session=self.session.rsession, exception=IOError)\n try:\n     (tags, entries) = parse_m3u(res.text)\n\n@@ -257,7 +257,7 @@ class HLSStreamIO(io.IOBase):\n         if not \"URI\" in tags[\"EXT-X-KEY\"][0]:\n             raise StreamError(\"Missing URI to decryption key\")\n\n\nres = urlget(tags[\"EXT-X-KEY\"][0][\"URI\"], exception=StreamError)\n\n\nres = urlget(tags[\"EXT-X-KEY\"][0][\"URI\"], session=self.session.rsession, exception=StreamError)\n             self.decryptor_key = res.content\n for i, entry in enumerate(entries):\n\n@@ -347,7 +347,7 @@ class HLSStream(Stream):\n @classmethod\n def parse_variant_playlist(cls, session, url, namekey=\"name\",\n                            nameprefix=\"\", params):\n-        res = urlget(url, exception=IOError, params)\n+        res = urlget(url, session=session.rsession, exception=IOError, **params)\n     streams = {}\n try:\n\ndiff --git a/src/livestreamer/utils.py b/src/livestreamer/utils.py\nindex 3bc5940..957986c 100644\n--- a/src/livestreamer/utils.py\n+++ b/src/livestreamer/utils.py\n@@ -34,12 +34,12 @@ def urlopen(url, method=\"get\", exception=PluginError, session=None,\nreturn res\n\n\n-def urlget(url, stream=False, args, kw):\n-    return urlopen(url, method=\"get\", stream=stream,\n+def urlget(url, stream=False, session=None, *args, kw):\n+    return urlopen(url, method=\"get\", session=session, stream=stream, \n                    args, **kw)\n-def urlresolve(url):\n-    res = urlget(url, stream=True, allow_redirects=False)\n+def urlresolve(url, session=None):\n+    res = urlget(url, stream=True, session=session, allow_redirects=False)\n if res.status_code == 302 and \"location\" in res.headers:\n     return res.headers[\"location\"]\n\n-- \n```\n.

Hi, \nHere is a working plugin for Livestreamer: https://gist.github.com/athoik/9918293\nTest URL: http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv173117558?ref=top&zroute=index \n. I did not try other streams :/ only main screen.\nSo special RTMP probably required, unless they switched to different provider. \n. Hello,\nI don't have a stream from Mips in order to test it. @K-S-V modifications can be found here: http://stream-recorder.com/forum/customized-rtmpdump-binaries-patch-file-t16103.html\n. Hello \nWeeb plugin requires @K-S-V rtmpdump. \nOriginal code was also from @K-S-V  https://github.com/K-S-V/Scripts/blob/master/WeebTV.php \nI don't see any change on the script the last 5 months. I'll check it when have time (probably weekend).\n. It seems you get data now by posting channel_id and quality to\nhttp://www.filmon.com/ajax/getChannelInfo\n@karlo2105, please feel free to provide a patch.\n2013/11/1 karlo2105 notifications@github.com\n\nFilmon plugin is broken.\n%systemdrive%\\progra~1\\livestreamer\\livestreamer \"\nhttp://www.filmon.com/tv/france-2\"\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin filmon for URL\nhttp://www.filmon.com/tv/france-2\nerror: Invalid JSON response\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/200#issuecomment-27564402\n.\n.

Anyone knows if this script https://github.com/K-S-V/Scripts/blob/master/BeatConvert.php is related with be-at.tv?\n. Actually BeatConvert related with be-at.tv. It seems that be-at.tv uses a custom protocol, every 12 seconds it requests a beat file. Downloader seems easy, but decrypting beat files.. well i dont know how easy can be.\n. Hello, \nHere is @K-S-V BeatConvert basic functionality ported to python, it will convert  a single beat recording into flv.\n``` python\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nfrom livestreamer.packages.flashmedia.types import U8,U16BE,U24BE,U32BE\nimport requests\nimport StringIO\nGlobal code starts here\navcCfgW = False\naacCfgW = False\nflvData = StringIO.StringIO()\nres = requests.get(\"http://www.be-at.tv/{RECORDING}/{QUALITY}/{SEQUENCE}.rec\")\nstream = StringIO.StringIO(res.content)\nflags = U8.read(stream)\nquality = flags & 15\nversion = flags >> 4\nlookupSize = U16BE.read(stream)\nencTable = stream.read(lookupSize)\nkey = \"\"\niv = \"\"\nfor i in range(0,16):\n    key += stream.read(1)\n    iv += stream.read(1)\nprint \"Key: \" + key.encode('hex')\nprint \"IV: \" + iv.encode('hex')\ndecryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)\ndecTable = decryptor.decrypt(encTable)\ndstream = StringIO.StringIO(decTable)\nDecode lookup table\nwhile True:\n    flags = U8.read(dstream)\n    if flags == 0:\n        break\ntyp = flags >> 4\nencrypted = (flags & 4) > 0\nkeyframe = (flags & 2) > 0\nconfig = (flags & 1) > 0\ntime = U32BE.read(dstream)\ndataLength = U32BE.read(dstream)\n\nif encrypted:\n    rawLength = U32BE.read(dstream)\nelse:\n    rawLength = dataLength\n\n# Decrypt encrypted tags\ndata = stream.read(dataLength)\nif encrypted:\n    decryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)\n    data = decryptor.decrypt(data)\n    #print data.encode('hex')\n    data = data[:rawLength]\n\n# Create video tag\nif typ == 1:\n    #Create codec tag\n    if version == 2:\n        codecTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n\n        if keyframe:\n            codecTag.write(U8.pack(7|16))\n        else:\n            codecTag.write(U8.pack(7|32))\n\n        if config:\n            codecTag.write(U8.pack(0))\n        else:\n            codecTag.write(U8.pack(1))\n\n        codecTag.write(U24BE.pack(0))\n    else:\n        codecTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n\n    # Create flv tag\n    flvTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n    flvTag.write(U8.pack(9))\n    flvTag.write(U24BE.pack(rawLength + codecTag.len))\n    flvTag.write(U24BE.pack(time & 0x00FFFFFF))\n    flvTag.write(U8.pack((time & 0xFF000000) >> 24))\n    flvTag.write(U24BE.pack(0))\n\n    # Write flv tag footer\n    videoTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n    flvTag.seek(0)\n    videoTag.write(flvTag.read())\n    codecTag.seek(0)\n    videoTag.write(codecTag.read())\n    videoTag.write(data)\n    videoTag.write(U32BE.pack(videoTag.len))\n\n    if config:\n        if avcCfgW:\n            videoTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n        else:\n            avcCfgW = True\n\n    videoTag.seek(0)\n    flvData.write(videoTag.read())\n\n# Create audio tag\nif typ == 2:\n\n    # Create codec tag\n    if version == 2:\n        codecTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n        codecTag.write(U8.pack(175))\n        if config:\n            codecTag.write(U8.pack(0))\n        else:\n            codecTag.write(U8.pack(1))\n    else:\n        codecTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n\n    # Create flv tag\n    flvTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n    flvTag.write(U8.pack(8))\n    flvTag.write(U24BE.pack(rawLength + codecTag.len))\n    flvTag.write(U24BE.pack(time & 0x00FFFFFF))\n    flvTag.write(U8.pack((time & 0xFF000000) >> 24))\n    flvTag.write(U24BE.pack(0))\n\n    # Write flv tag footer\n    audioTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n    flvTag.seek(0)\n    audioTag.write(flvTag.read())\n    codecTag.seek(0)\n    audioTag.write(codecTag.read())\n    audioTag.write(data)\n    audioTag.write(U32BE.pack(audioTag.len))\n\n    if config:\n       if aacCfgW:\n           audioTag = StringIO.StringIO()\n       else:\n           aacCfgW = True\n\n    audioTag.seek(0)\n    flvData.write(audioTag.read())\n\nprint \"Writing File....\\n\"\nwith open(\"test.flv\", \"wb\") as f:\n    flvh = \"464c5601050000000900000000\".decode(\"hex\")\n    f.write(flvh)\n    flvData.seek(0)\n    f.write(flvData.read())\n```\n.

There more improvement ofc but at least is a good start.\n. I've made some changes here : https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358\nNow it works for live streams also.\n. I've made another change that might cause the above message. Try with latest version from here: https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358\n. There was a missing close in the loop. Try again with latest https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358/revisions\n. Dear @chrippa,\nCan you have a look https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358\nMaybe there is further tuning, eg use the FLVContact or use Tag etc?\n. Dear @chrippa, \nThanks for the suggestions, most of the issues solved. ~~I did use FLVTagConcat without modifications (so there is room for further improvements, like override the iter_tags).~~\n~~Is it necessary to override iter_tags or its good enough for inclusion?~~\nEdit1. iter_tags was overridden\n. Changing audio_tag = b\"\" and video_tag = b\"\" with continue should fix it.\n. @chrippa, well your knowledge in FLV is great! I made changes here but above doesn't work for version 1 streams. \nIn version 1 there is no video and audio tagging (i think so), so how this can be done?\n. And you are right once again :+1:  \nRawData did the job. https://gist.github.com/athoik/9723358/revisions\nHere is a version 1 url: http://www.be-at.tv/brands/coco-maya/viva-warriors/detlef\n.

Hi @K-S-V,\nIt's really good to see you here... Thank you for all the patches you are making available! \nIt would be really nice to examine @chrippa https://github.com/chrippa/python-librtmp, maybe there is an better way of supporting new sites, without the need of patching rtmpdump every time. \nPS. Your latest patch doen't apply nicely after latest commits on rtmpdump \n.

Perhaps the same technique could be implemented internally to livestreamer using some optional --gomtv-set-start n--gomtv-set-end m parameters.

Great, indeed it works with the latest version ^^ Will check in the future before I post some possible issues. Thanks for the great project and the support :+1: \n. I also just ran into the problem of watching password-protected connectcast streams, and the plugin fails as the password-protected page misses the data-playback field for the manifest. If I enter the password on the website and using the manifest of the website in the connectcast plugin (hardcoded to the python code) I'm able to watch the stream just fine. I would also like to see password support for connectcast.tv similar to the other plugins that already support this functionality.\n. Is there a solution for this yet?\n. This is great, thank you so much! I'm totally fine with the shell based set switching at the moment. Perhaps the same technique could be implemented internally to livestreamer using some optional --gomtv-set-start n--gomtv-set-end m parameters.

Since today I have a problem with the VODs (don't know about the live stream, didn't test that):\nlivestreamer --gomtv-username XXX --gomtv-password XXX -o 2013gsls1_vod_71479_best_1.avi http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=1 best\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin gomtv for URL http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=1\n[plugin.gomtv][info] Attempting to authenticate with username and password\n[plugin.gomtv][info] Successfully logged in as XXXX\n[plugin.gomtv][info] Cookie for reusing this session: XXX\n[plugin.gomtv][info] Playlist items found:\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 1 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=1&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 2 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=2&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 3 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=3&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 4 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=4&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 5 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=5&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 6 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=6&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 7 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=7&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 8 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=8&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 9 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=9&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 10 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=10&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 11 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=11&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 12 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=12&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 13 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=13&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 14 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=14&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][info] [Set 15 (ENG)] http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=15&lang=0\n[plugin.gomtv][warning] Unable to parse manifest\n[plugin.gomtv][warning] Unable to parse manifest\n[plugin.gomtv][warning] Unable to access any streams, make sure you have access to this VOD\n[cli][error] No streams found on this URL: http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71479/?set=1\nIs this just a minor issue?\n.

Great, indeed it works with the latest version ^^ Will check in the future before I post some possible issues. Thanks for the great project and the support :+1: \n. I also just ran into the problem of watching password-protected connectcast streams, and the plugin fails as the password-protected page misses the data-playback field for the manifest. If I enter the password on the website and using the manifest of the website in the connectcast plugin (hardcoded to the python code) I'm able to watch the stream just fine. I would also like to see password support for connectcast.tv similar to the other plugins that already support this functionality.\n. Is there a solution for this yet?\n. ",

    "skulblakka": "Twitch uses two different systems for VODs. One is HLS based and the other one is Flash based. While you should be able to use the time parameter on the Flash based VODs it will not work on the HLS based one because Livestreamer does currently not support HLS seeking.\n. Of couse you need to replace the \"channel\" in twitch.tv/channel with the channel you want to watch. For example: If you want to watch \"machinima\" you enter \"twitch.tv/machinima\" instead of twitch.tv/channel\n. Running \"livestreamer twitch.tv/machinima best\" runs the stream without any problems. Maybe it works now?\n. To use the desktop resolutions you need to configure rtmpdump. As I used the Windows Installer it was already included and I just had to add \"rtmpdump=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\rtmpdump.exe\" to the livestreamerrc file.\n. Since I started using livestreamer and vlc with a cache of 10s I can watch twitch lag free most of the time but I think it strongly depends on the server that you use. Sadly I dont think that there is a way to select the server.\n. I mean setting the file-caching to 10000ms (10s).\n. Did you try lower resolutions like high or middle instead of best or source?\n. When you run it does it say \"rtmpdump is not available\"?\n. > But this is cumbersome to remember and type every time.\nYou can do this with the livestreamerrc config file as described here http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#configuration-file\n. You can do this by going to %appdata%/livestreamer and opening the livestreamerrc file. There you find some player commands like player=\"D:\\Program Files (x86)\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe\" --file-caching=5000 (if not just add them). Just remove the # and adjust the time.\n. I always get these \"Failed to open sequence (Read timed out)\" errors when my internet connection is to slow.\n. > Problem is that livestreamer wants the page where the stream resides, not the stream itself.\nCouldn't you just send the page where you found the file to livestreamer instead of the file itself?\n. Could you please provide a little bit more information (or anything at all)?\n. I think there is no way to delete it. You should have just edit it instead of opening a second one. \n. > Now must find a way to get twitch chat to be in an individual window.\nYou can do this by opening twitch.tv/CHANNELNAME/chat?popout in your browser\n. This might help you http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#tutorial\n. To use it with youtube you basically just need to replace the twitch.tv/day9tv in the tutorial with the url of the video you want to open (but i think thats pretty obvious)\n. I'm using livestreamer without any issue on my mac. I can simply run it by entering \"livestreamer\" into Terminal without having root access. But maybe looking into #147  and/or #355 will help you.\n. On Windows this seems to be a little more complicated than on Linux. Take a look at the script I posted in #1244 \n. Try this one.  It should work (but I don't really understand how this validation api works so it's probably no very well programmed)\n. No need to compile it.

Simply open the control panel -> \"Network and Internet\"* -> \"Internet settings\"*. This should be the same settings that IE uses.\n*Translated from the german version.\n. This one basically works but VLC says it can't decode \"undf\" quite often. (I saw this issue once somewhere else but I don't know how it was resolved)\n.

If you add --player-passthrough=hls you can use the player to jump to a specific time (at least when the player supports hls like vlc)\n. Twitch uses two different systems for VODs (one is flash based (the /b/ ones) and one is hls based (the /v/ ones)). Because Livestreamer does not support seeking for HLS the t parameter only works on URLs containing /b/.\n. > The only way to get back is to fast forward\nUsing the aforementioned  --player-passthrough=hls allows you to use your players seeking method. (In VLC you can either use the bar at the bottom or click on the time to enter the time you want to jump to (I think you can also use \"-start-time\" as a player argument to start at a specific time but I haven't tried that one))\n. See #223 \n. > rtmpdump: command not found\nDo you have rtmpdump installed and added to you path?\n. Can't can confirm.

Are you using the newest version? \nbtw. what stream are you trying to open?\n. > Is it working like this?\nNo. You also need to enter the \"--\" part. Your example would look like:\nlivestreamer http://mydomain.com/playlist.m3u8 --hls-live-edge 5 --hls-segment-attempts 20\n. Did this happen before or is this only happening now? Because twitch currently has some server issues.\n. - Download the complete source code from GitHub\n- Make your changes in /livestreamer/src/livestreamer/plugins/ustream.py\n- Open CMD and move to /livestreamer or right click into the directory while holding shift and select \"Open command prompt here\"\n- Enter \"python setup.py install\" and hit enter\n. This means version 1.11.1 is still installed. Make sure to remove 1.11.1 before you install 1.12.\n. This is currently not possible. (See #194 )\n. See #711 for seeking in twitch vods.\n. See #711 for seeking in twitch vods.\n. I think the \"Max retries\" is not thrown by twitch. Sounds more like livestreamer is unable to resolve the address or something. Take a look at #538.\n. Looks like you are using twitch-livestreamer-gui and it has some kind of connection error. Make sure to check your Firewall and internet connection. If the problem persists you could consider opening a new issue over there.\n. This is currently not possible. See #711 \n. Duplicate of #632\n. Have you tried using the nightly build?\n. You can easily use file caching with VLC by simply adding \"--file-chaching=XXX\" to the player path in the config file. (XXX is the time in ms you want to cache)\nFor example it looks like this in my config \nplayer=\"D:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe\" --file-caching=10000\nThe above will cache 10 seconds.\nIf you still have performance issues you can try playing with the --hls-segment-threads and --hls-live-edge parameters\n. If you do not want to modify your config file you can simply enter\nlivestreamer --player=\"C:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe --file-caching=10000\" --hls-segment-threads 5 --hls-live-edge 3 twitch.tv/day9tv best\nThe above will start VLC (you might need to change the path) with caching enabled for 10s, start 5 threads for loading the stream and wait for 3 segments before starting. (Play a little bit with the values for hls-segment-threads and hls-live-edge if you still having performance issues)\n. Weird. Entered the exact same command as you posted (just changed the player path) and it worked like intended.\nAre you sure you are using the latest version? What does livestreamer --version return?\nMy config looks like this. (I have not set the amount of threads in the config file because I normally not need more then one)\n. Have you tried setting the location of livestreamer manually in the settings?\n. Do you mean something like this?\n. If you don't want to wait for the new release just install from source or install the latest nightly build if you are on windows.\n. This is a known issue with mpc-hc (See #346)\n. Probably a duplicate of #943 \n. No. The current version is 1.12.2\n. Works fine here. What version are you using?\n. I'm not sure if this is ever going to be implemented.\nYou either need to help yourself (using your own script) or if you are looking for something for twitch you could try livestreamer-twitch-gui\n. There is currently no stream on faceittv. They are currently hosting another stream (dreamhackcs).\n. If you just want livestreamer to return the URL of the stream use the stream-url parameter\n. Like it says you can use the --player command to specify the location of the player.\nYou can do this either in the command itself. For example:\nlivestreamer twitch.tv/twitch best --player=\"C:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe\"\nOr you can change the value inside the livestreamerrc file.\n. > So you can't connect to YouTube for example, as they use either HTTPS, HLS or RTSP\nThats were livestreamer comes into place though. The stream is normally served to the player using pipes. I don't know anything about Banshee but if it is capable of understanding HTTP you should be able to use HTTP instead of stdin using --player-http.\n. Have you tried increasing --rtmp-timeout? \nAlso using --player-continuous-http might help.\n. Hey there,\nplease take a look at #711 \n. You can try changing the --hls-live-edge parameter.\n. > Anyone knows where I can find that?\nTake a look at the documentation.\n. The documentation for --player-external-http-port says \"A fixed port to use for the external HTTP server if that mode is enabled.\".\nTry using both --player-external-http-port and --player-external-http.\n. > I'm trying this on my Windows PC, and it's tellming me \"rtmpdump\" isn't recognized as a command\nYou either need to change to the directory in which the rtmpdump.exe is located or you simply add it to your path variable.\n. Like last year you can find the URLs inside the site's source code:\nhttps://streams.muenchen.tv/streams/muenchentv.stream_1/jwplayer.m3u8 (Main stream)\nhttps://streams.muenchen.tv/wiesncam/wiesencam2.stream_1/jwplayer.m3u8 (Festzelt)\nhttps://streams.muenchen.tv/wiesncam/wiesencam1.stream_1/jwplayer.m3u8 (Wirtsbudenstra\u00dfe)\nYou can play these by using livestreamer hlsvariant://\"{URL}\" best\nYou can also use \".stream_2\" and \".stream_3\" instead of \".stream_1\" if you want use the lower quality streams.\n. Duplicate of #1055 and should be fixed as soon #1076 is merged. (Check the issue to manually fix this in the mean time)\n. Like @0880 said. There is currently no new release of livestreamer. Use the Nightly builds  on Windows or use pip install -U git+https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer.git to get the latest development version via pip.\n. @tenminute Just download the ZIP and extract it somewhere. Now add the new location to the path variable. Make sure that the path you add actually contains the livestreamer.exe\nAfter this you can use livestreamer like with the installer version. (you might have to relog or reboot to make the changes take affect)\n. > Unable to find C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\rtmpdump.exe command\nYou need rtmpdump to watch rtmp streams. You can download it here. Just put the rtmpdump.exe inside C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\ or change the path in the livestreamer configuration file.\n. Have you tried playing a normal video in your media player while playing CS or does this only happen when running via livestreamer? I had some weird issues with games too when VLC was using DirectX/Direct3D/Direct2D for video output.\n. > His own ingame sound is fine\nI was not talking about the sound issues. For me it was like DirectX glitched out rendering the game on one monitor and the vlc video output on the other one.\nHowever I agree that this is most likely not caused by livestreamer itself.\n. Twitch streams are in HLS. If you use the hls-passthrough option with a hls stream, all livestreamer does is give the stream URL to the player. The player handles all the rest (like loading the stream). This is why you don't see anything in the command window, because the problem occurs in VLC.\nHave you tried if the problem persists with another player?\n. > I believe Twitch cuts VODs into 30 minute segments\nI think this was only the case with the old flash based VOD system\nI'm no expert but maybe the vlc logs show something interesting when the stream blacks out. You can find the log (and change the verbosity level) under Tools->Messages (Ctrl+M).\n. > Do you know if MPC-HC has any log as well that I can enable\nI don't know. I never used MPC-HC myself and a quick google search revealed nothing.\n\ndo you have these issues yourself when you play a Twitch VOD with HLS passthrough\n\nIf the stream is loading slow (because twitch servers are busy or something else is sucking up all my bandwidth) the video and audio will sometime become temporarily asynchronous but will normally fix itself after a few seconds.\n\nwhat player are you using\n\nI am using mpv (but never had any problems using VLC)\n. I normally use hls-segment-threads 5 and hls-segment-attempts 5 together with 1024MB ringbuffer. As far as I know the ringbuffer is used between livestreamer and the player (livestramer writes into it and the player reads from it; allowing livestreamer to continue loading the stream while the player is not requesting it (because it is paused for example)).\nHowever like I said before when you use hls-passthrough with a HLS stream like a Twitch VOD or livestream all livestreamer will do is give the URL to the player. This means the player will handle loading the stream and not livestreamer (this means all the network specific settings like the ones you mentioned will do nothing)\n. > Is there any negative side-effect by having a huge ringbuffer?\nThis depends on your system. The ringbuffer needs to be stored somewhere so if you are running livestreamer on a raspberry pi or something similar I would not make it that large. On my desktop or laptop I noticed no negative side-effect.\n\nwhat is and how do I fix it? I'm all ears for ideas.\n\nYou could try increasing the network timeouts and cache size of your video player\n. Using VLC I only ever used the --file-caching option (normally I used --file-caching=10000).\n. > permission denied\nTake a look at #401 and #355\n. What player are you using? And have you tried using a different one?\n. Take a look at #819. Maybe one of the described workarounds works for you.\n. Duplicate of #711 \n. Take a look at #819. Maybe one of the solutions there works for you.\n. While this is not really an answer to your problem I would recommend that you install livestreamer using pip (I would recommend the development version because the last release is kinda old). Take a look at the documentation for more details.\n. @ignarteaga Here you go http://azubuhlslivesp12-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/223613/hls-saopaulo-12_2/video206512CHGamesAcademy/master.m3u8\n. I used the \"Network\" tab in the developer tools of Google Chrome and searched for \"master.m3u8\"\n. I simply opened the network tab and entered \"master.m3u8\" into the filter field (make sure to reload the page after you went to the tab as by default it will only record everything that happened after you opened it)\n. The azevinho files contain the current parts of the stream (it will constantly reload while the stream is running). The master file however contains links to the different azevinho files for the different qualities. This way you can choose the quality when using the master file (You should actually be able to play the stream with the azevinho file (it will however only contain a single qualitiy; also you may use hls:// in front of the URL instead of hlsvariant://)\n. You have to enter the quality together with the original command. \nFor example: livestreamer twitch.tv/kildemon best\n. If livestreamer exists normally because the stream ended, you could make a little batch script that calls livestreamer in an loop.\n. This little script will start livestreamer in an endless loop (meaning when the stream ends for example livestreamer will be started again) until you interrupt it with CTRL+C. It will also have the current timestamp in the filename.\n``` batch\n@echo off\n:loop\nfor /f \"tokens=2 delims==\" %%a in ('wmic OS Get localdatetime /value') do set \"dt=%%a\"\nset \"YY=%dt:~2,2%\" & set \"YYYY=%dt:~0,4%\" & set \"MM=%dt:~4,2%\" & set \"DD=%dt:~6,2%\"\nset \"HH=%dt:~8,2%\" & set \"Min=%dt:~10,2%\" & set \"Sec=%dt:~12,2%\"\nset \"datestamp=%YYYY%%MM%%DD%\" & set \"timestamp=%HH%%Min%%Sec%\"\nset \"fullstamp=%YYYY%-%MM%-%DD%_%HH%-%Min%-%Sec%\"\nlivestreamer twitch.tv/cohhcarnage best -o \"S:\\cohhcarnage-%fullstamp%\"\nGOTO loop\n```\nSimply replace \"twitch.tv/cohhcarnage\" with the stream you want to record and adjust the filename. If you don't want the script to loop simply remove the \"GOTO loop\" at the end.\n. You have to create a .bat file. Then copy the code above into it. You should then be able to start the script by double clicking on the file.\n. Weird. All the script does is to receive the current date and time from Windows and then start livestreamer. So if livestreamer works normally via command line it should also here.\n. You can also write a simple batch script that starts livestreamer after a specified time. On Windows you can use timeout /t x to wait x seconds.\n. @refriedfood Your issue is unrelated to this one. See #1284 \n. Both URLs work fine over here. \n\n500 Server Error: Internal Server Error\n\nMight have been a temporal issue on twitch's side.\n. You can use a script like this one https://gist.github.com/chrippa/6151877\n. It's not really retrying. It's more like it will wait for 100 seconds for an answer from the server.\n. > with a username in the url i get a ' no plugin can handle this url'\nI think you did something wrong then as the PR should fix exactly this.\n. Duplicate of #1306 \n. The documentation regarding --player-external-http-port says:\n\nA fixed port to use for the external HTTP server if that mode is enabled. Omit or set to 0 to use a random high (>1024) port.\n\nI would guess that means that you have to use --player-external-http to enable external-http mode and --player-external-http-port to set the port.\n.

Do you have the same issue as OP or is there any different output?\n. @richrichards This is a different issue with twitch's recent API change. See #1478.\n. It seems like this project has been abandoned by the original developer. \nstreamlink is a fork of this project with multiple active developers. They also already fixed the issue with picarto.. Take a look at #303 and #812 . I honestly don't know much about ffmpeg. \nIf you want to repeatedly start livestreamer when it disconnects, you can also take a look at the scripts posted in #1244. In theory you could also extend the script a little bit to kill livestreamer after an hour . This way you could create one hour long segments without even having to use ffmpeg (you would however loose a little bit of video while livestreamer reconnects).. Changing the last part (above the goto) of the script to something like the following might work:\nstart \"livestreamer-%fullstamp%\" livestreamer twitch.tv/monstercat best -o \"S:\\monstercat-%fullstamp%\"\ntimeout /t 3600\ntaskkill /FI \"WINDOWTITLE eq livestreamer-%fullstamp%\"\nThis will start livestreamer and then send a terminate request to livestreamer after 3600 seconds..

Fixed it.. Like I said above I don't have a Mac. The file above works on my linux machine and at least in theory run on mac too. Maybe the text editor you used added additional characters to the file that shouldn't be in a bash script?. @flijloku Your script won't work for him since he is using a Mac\n@iamWALRUS77 I made a mistake when copy and pasting the script to github yesterday. While I fixed it pretty quick it looks like you were faster copying it^^\nWhat you are missing is the last part in the livestreamer line which is also the reason why you had issues with missing brackets. (You are basically missing the %s for the seconds in the filename and the & pid=! at the end of line 5)\n\nAlso with this script will it restart after terminating or do I need to add to this?\n\nYes, thats what the do while does. The script will repeat until you press CTRL-C to terminate it.. @dajoka I don't exactly understand your issue. You can simply change the URL twitch.tv/monstercat to whatever URL you want to use. Works the same as with the command prompt.. Is that the full file? The snippet is intended to be an extension to another script (see the thread I referenced before, basically you are missing the loop and the calculation of the timestamp). \nHowever that snipped should still run livestreamer once. What is happening if you run the bat file? Whats the output the command prompt is showing?. See #1574. Twitch uses two different systems for VODs. One is HLS based and the other one is Flash based. While you should be able to use the time parameter on the Flash based VODs it will not work on the HLS based one because Livestreamer does currently not support HLS seeking.\n. Of couse you need to replace the \"channel\" in twitch.tv/channel with the channel you want to watch. For example: If you want to watch \"machinima\" you enter \"twitch.tv/machinima\" instead of twitch.tv/channel\n. Running \"livestreamer twitch.tv/machinima best\" runs the stream without any problems. Maybe it works now?\n. To use the desktop resolutions you need to configure rtmpdump. As I used the Windows Installer it was already included and I just had to add \"rtmpdump=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\rtmpdump.exe\" to the livestreamerrc file.\n. Since I started using livestreamer and vlc with a cache of 10s I can watch twitch lag free most of the time but I think it strongly depends on the server that you use. Sadly I dont think that there is a way to select the server.\n. I mean setting the file-caching to 10000ms (10s).\n. Did you try lower resolutions like high or middle instead of best or source?\n. When you run it does it say \"rtmpdump is not available\"?\n. > But this is cumbersome to remember and type every time.\nYou can do this with the livestreamerrc config file as described here http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#configuration-file\n. You can do this by going to %appdata%/livestreamer and opening the livestreamerrc file. There you find some player commands like player=\"D:\\Program Files (x86)\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe\" --file-caching=5000 (if not just add them). Just remove the # and adjust the time.\n. I always get these \"Failed to open sequence (Read timed out)\" errors when my internet connection is to slow.\n. > Problem is that livestreamer wants the page where the stream resides, not the stream itself.\nCouldn't you just send the page where you found the file to livestreamer instead of the file itself?\n. Could you please provide a little bit more information (or anything at all)?\n. I think there is no way to delete it. You should have just edit it instead of opening a second one. \n. > Now must find a way to get twitch chat to be in an individual window.\nYou can do this by opening twitch.tv/CHANNELNAME/chat?popout in your browser\n. This might help you http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#tutorial\n. To use it with youtube you basically just need to replace the twitch.tv/day9tv in the tutorial with the url of the video you want to open (but i think thats pretty obvious)\n. I'm using livestreamer without any issue on my mac. I can simply run it by entering \"livestreamer\" into Terminal without having root access. But maybe looking into #147  and/or #355 will help you.\n. On Windows this seems to be a little more complicated than on Linux. Take a look at the script I posted in #1244 \n. Try this one.

Because Livestreamer does not support seeking for HLS the t parameter only works on URLs containing /b/.\n. > The only way to get back is to fast forward\nUsing the aforementioned  --player-passthrough=hls allows you to use your players seeking method. (In VLC you can either use the bar at the bottom or click on the time to enter the time you want to jump to (I think you can also use \"-start-time\" as a player argument to start at a specific time but I haven't tried that one))\n.

If the problem persists you could consider opening a new issue over there.\n. This is currently not possible. See #711 \n. Duplicate of #632\n. Have you tried using the nightly build?\n. You can easily use file caching with VLC by simply adding \"--file-chaching=XXX\" to the player path in the config file. (XXX is the time in ms you want to cache)\nFor example it looks like this in my config \nplayer=\"D:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe\" --file-caching=10000\nThe above will cache 10 seconds.\nIf you still have performance issues you can try playing with the --hls-segment-threads and --hls-live-edge parameters\n. If you do not want to modify your config file you can simply enter\nlivestreamer --player=\"C:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe --file-caching=10000\" --hls-segment-threads 5 --hls-live-edge 3 twitch.tv/day9tv best\nThe above will start VLC (you might need to change the path) with caching enabled for 10s, start 5 threads for loading the stream and wait for 3 segments before starting. (Play a little bit with the values for hls-segment-threads and hls-live-edge if you still having performance issues)\n. Weird. Entered the exact same command as you posted (just changed the player path) and it worked like intended.\nAre you sure you are using the latest version? What does livestreamer --version return?\nMy config looks like this. (I have not set the amount of threads in the config file because I normally not need more then one)\n. Have you tried setting the location of livestreamer manually in the settings?\n. Do you mean something like this?\n. If you don't want to wait for the new release just install from source or install the latest nightly build if you are on windows.\n. This is a known issue with mpc-hc (See #346)\n. Probably a duplicate of #943 \n. No. The current version is 1.12.2\n. Works fine here. What version are you using?\n. I'm not sure if this is ever going to be implemented.\nYou either need to help yourself (using your own script) or if you are looking for something for twitch you could try livestreamer-twitch-gui\n. There is currently no stream on faceittv. They are currently hosting another stream (dreamhackcs).\n. If you just want livestreamer to return the URL of the stream use the stream-url parameter\n. Like it says you can use the --player command to specify the location of the player.\nYou can do this either in the command itself. For example:\nlivestreamer twitch.tv/twitch best --player=\"C:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe\"\nOr you can change the value inside the livestreamerrc file.\n. > So you can't connect to YouTube for example, as they use either HTTPS, HLS or RTSP\nThats were livestreamer comes into place though. The stream is normally served to the player using pipes. I don't know anything about Banshee but if it is capable of understanding HTTP you should be able to use HTTP instead of stdin using --player-http.\n. Have you tried increasing --rtmp-timeout? \nAlso using --player-continuous-http might help.\n. Hey there,\nplease take a look at #711 \n. You can try changing the --hls-live-edge parameter.\n. > Anyone knows where I can find that?\nTake a look at the documentation.\n. The documentation for --player-external-http-port says \"A fixed port to use for the external HTTP server if that mode is enabled.\".\nTry using both --player-external-http-port and --player-external-http.\n. > I'm trying this on my Windows PC, and it's tellming me \"rtmpdump\" isn't recognized as a command\nYou either need to change to the directory in which the rtmpdump.exe is located or you simply add it to your path variable.\n. Like last year you can find the URLs inside the site's source code:\nhttps://streams.muenchen.tv/streams/muenchentv.stream_1/jwplayer.m3u8 (Main stream)\nhttps://streams.muenchen.tv/wiesncam/wiesencam2.stream_1/jwplayer.m3u8 (Festzelt)\nhttps://streams.muenchen.tv/wiesncam/wiesencam1.stream_1/jwplayer.m3u8 (Wirtsbudenstra\u00dfe)\nYou can play these by using livestreamer hlsvariant://\"{URL}\" best\nYou can also use \".stream_2\" and \".stream_3\" instead of \".stream_1\" if you want use the lower quality streams.\n. Duplicate of #1055 and should be fixed as soon #1076 is merged. (Check the issue to manually fix this in the mean time)\n. Like @0880 said. There is currently no new release of livestreamer. Use the Nightly builds  on Windows or use pip install -U git+https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer.git to get the latest development version via pip.\n. @tenminute Just download the ZIP and extract it somewhere. Now add the new location to the path variable. Make sure that the path you add actually contains the livestreamer.exe\nAfter this you can use livestreamer like with the installer version. (you might have to relog or reboot to make the changes take affect)\n. > Unable to find C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\rtmpdump.exe command\nYou need rtmpdump to watch rtmp streams. You can download it here. Just put the rtmpdump.exe inside C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\rtmpdump\\ or change the path in the livestreamer configuration file.\n. Have you tried playing a normal video in your media player while playing CS or does this only happen when running via livestreamer? I had some weird issues with games too when VLC was using DirectX/Direct3D/Direct2D for video output.\n. > His own ingame sound is fine\nI was not talking about the sound issues. For me it was like DirectX glitched out rendering the game on one monitor and the vlc video output on the other one.\nHowever I agree that this is most likely not caused by livestreamer itself.\n. Twitch streams are in HLS. If you use the hls-passthrough option with a hls stream, all livestreamer does is give the stream URL to the player. The player handles all the rest (like loading the stream). This is why you don't see anything in the command window, because the problem occurs in VLC.\nHave you tried if the problem persists with another player?\n. > I believe Twitch cuts VODs into 30 minute segments\nI think this was only the case with the old flash based VOD system\nI'm no expert but maybe the vlc logs show something interesting when the stream blacks out. You can find the log (and change the verbosity level) under Tools->Messages (Ctrl+M).\n. > Do you know if MPC-HC has any log as well that I can enable\nI don't know. I never used MPC-HC myself and a quick google search revealed nothing.\n\ndo you have these issues yourself when you play a Twitch VOD with HLS passthrough\n\nIf the stream is loading slow (because twitch servers are busy or something else is sucking up all my bandwidth) the video and audio will sometime become temporarily asynchronous but will normally fix itself after a few seconds.\n\nwhat player are you using\n\nI am using mpv (but never had any problems using VLC)\n. I normally use hls-segment-threads 5 and hls-segment-attempts 5 together with 1024MB ringbuffer. As far as I know the ringbuffer is used between livestreamer and the player (livestramer writes into it and the player reads from it; allowing livestreamer to continue loading the stream while the player is not requesting it (because it is paused for example)).\nHowever like I said before when you use hls-passthrough with a HLS stream like a Twitch VOD or livestream all livestreamer will do is give the URL to the player. This means the player will handle loading the stream and not livestreamer (this means all the network specific settings like the ones you mentioned will do nothing)\n. > Is there any negative side-effect by having a huge ringbuffer?\nThis depends on your system. The ringbuffer needs to be stored somewhere so if you are running livestreamer on a raspberry pi or something similar I would not make it that large. On my desktop or laptop I noticed no negative side-effect.\n\nwhat is and how do I fix it? I'm all ears for ideas.\n\nYou could try increasing the network timeouts and cache size of your video player\n. Using VLC I only ever used the --file-caching option (normally I used --file-caching=10000).\n. > permission denied\nTake a look at #401 and #355\n. What player are you using? And have you tried using a different one?\n. Take a look at #819. Maybe one of the described workarounds works for you.\n. Duplicate of #711 \n. Take a look at #819. Maybe one of the solutions there works for you.\n. While this is not really an answer to your problem I would recommend that you install livestreamer using pip (I would recommend the development version because the last release is kinda old). Take a look at the documentation for more details.\n. @ignarteaga Here you go http://azubuhlslivesp12-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/223613/hls-saopaulo-12_2/video206512CHGamesAcademy/master.m3u8\n. I used the \"Network\" tab in the developer tools of Google Chrome and searched for \"master.m3u8\"\n. I simply opened the network tab and entered \"master.m3u8\" into the filter field (make sure to reload the page after you went to the tab as by default it will only record everything that happened after you opened it)\n. The azevinho files contain the current parts of the stream (it will constantly reload while the stream is running). The master file however contains links to the different azevinho files for the different qualities. This way you can choose the quality when using the master file (You should actually be able to play the stream with the azevinho file (it will however only contain a single qualitiy; also you may use hls:// in front of the URL instead of hlsvariant://)\n. You have to enter the quality together with the original command. \nFor example: livestreamer twitch.tv/kildemon best\n. If livestreamer exists normally because the stream ended, you could make a little batch script that calls livestreamer in an loop.\n. This little script will start livestreamer in an endless loop (meaning when the stream ends for example livestreamer will be started again) until you interrupt it with CTRL+C. It will also have the current timestamp in the filename.\n``` batch\n@echo off\n:loop\nfor /f \"tokens=2 delims==\" %%a in ('wmic OS Get localdatetime /value') do set \"dt=%%a\"\nset \"YY=%dt:~2,2%\" & set \"YYYY=%dt:~0,4%\" & set \"MM=%dt:~4,2%\" & set \"DD=%dt:~6,2%\"\nset \"HH=%dt:~8,2%\" & set \"Min=%dt:~10,2%\" & set \"Sec=%dt:~12,2%\"\nset \"datestamp=%YYYY%%MM%%DD%\" & set \"timestamp=%HH%%Min%%Sec%\"\nset \"fullstamp=%YYYY%-%MM%-%DD%_%HH%-%Min%-%Sec%\"\nlivestreamer twitch.tv/cohhcarnage best -o \"S:\\cohhcarnage-%fullstamp%\"\nGOTO loop\n```\nSimply replace \"twitch.tv/cohhcarnage\" with the stream you want to record and adjust the filename. If you don't want the script to loop simply remove the \"GOTO loop\" at the end.\n. You have to create a .bat file. Then copy the code above into it. You should then be able to start the script by double clicking on the file.\n. Weird. All the script does is to receive the current date and time from Windows and then start livestreamer. So if livestreamer works normally via command line it should also here.\n. You can also write a simple batch script that starts livestreamer after a specified time. On Windows you can use timeout /t x to wait x seconds.\n. @refriedfood Your issue is unrelated to this one. See #1284 \n. Both URLs work fine over here. \n\n500 Server Error: Internal Server Error\n\nMight have been a temporal issue on twitch's side.\n. You can use a script like this one https://gist.github.com/chrippa/6151877\n. It's not really retrying. It's more like it will wait for 100 seconds for an answer from the server.\n. > with a username in the url i get a ' no plugin can handle this url'\nI think you did something wrong then as the PR should fix exactly this.\n.

I was playing with this and i can get the RTMP Url and will play in VLC direct But not Livestreamer, \nso i guess this is closed for now, would be nice to play via Livestreamer\n. oh ok and what about quality settings?  andf how do we know which type each service uses?  thanks!\n. yes i understand that but how do i add that extension to the output file in the .bat file? or am i missing something?\n. that doesnt look available to windows... right now it just saves at best possible \"as is\" correct?  if that is the case i am fine with that, i just was making a bat file and was giving a name with \"date and Time\"  and used .ts and .mp4 and they both seemed to play\n. if i open say ustream with \"best\"  it will save at that quaility that i list...  basically exactly as we see in VLC it will look when saved?\n. thanks!\n. Stream from Plex to live streamer? \n. i made a streamer to send to roku but not sure about plex either  but it seems possible since plex is just a streamer right?\n. give me more info on what your trying to do i have been working on a streamer but need to know what Plex needs to accept as a stream i have it set up for HLS now \n. sorry i meant is it possible to Play the video in FFPLAY or FFMpeg in place of VLC\n. thanks!\n. well i wanted to keep player open if possible but testing again now with the --player-no-close  doesn't work.\nit keeps the window open as it says but without player window closing the .bat file wont execute any farther.\nas soon as player window closes it will continue the loop in the bat file\n. OK but I will need to test when I get home but I don't recall it\nclosing the player at stream end.\nonly when I manually closed VLC would it continue the loop\n. thanks will give that a try tonight and let you know how it goes...  do you know a easy or a way to get cookies in that manner?\n. so in the bat file i should add the directory where the config files are located? or on php?  how would i do either?\n. what exactly am i supposed to be in this ?? \ncan this be put in the bat file as well?  it just needs the folder where the config file is right?\n. ok now what it is doing is not recognizing the rtmp dump i did the following test(s)\n1.) took the folder in application folder that said livestreamer and dragged it to the desktop \n2.) ran the php file, it  then said  at top of the bat file i get this error:\n     Environment variable ---------- not defined\n3.) then it says it cant find rtmp dump.\ni did notice from the php file when i used this command:\nputenv(\"APPDATA=C:\\Documents and Settings\\settop\\Application Data\");\nit created a new \"livestreamer\" folder BUT only added the \"cli.json\" file and not the \"livestreamerrc\" file.\nwhen i put back the old \"livestreamerrc\" in the folder I get a rtmp dump error and it needed to be closed.\n. just in case... i am calling the bat file like this from php:\n$WshShell = new COM(\"WScript.Shell\");\n$oExec  = $WshShell->Run('cmd /C startStreamer.bat', 2, false);\nunset($WshShell, $oExec);\nthe bat is simple:\n@echo on\ncd C:\\Program Files\\Livestreamer\nlivestreamer \"http://www.ilive.to/view/68283\" best\nplays when i use bat alone, the minute i use from the php it just gives me the popup that rtmpdump needs to close... tried getting logs to show but cant seem to get that to work even using --subprocess-errorlog\nany other way i can get you a log info to see what it is?\n. it allows to run in background.... the shell_exec  will wait and hold up the page let me check it out, but it takes a long time to execute leaving window blank..    the other method allows to move on as it works in background\n. what do you mean by keeping it intact?\nso anyways when i change the bat file to this:\n@echo on\nlivestreamer\\rtmpdump.exe  --help \npause\nit doesnt crash... i also used this:\n@echo on\nlivestreamer\\livestreamer.exe --config config.ini --stream-url vaughnlive.tv/arconai701 best >url.txt\npause\nand this is called from PHP with out any issues.  but if i try to play it or save it i get the rtmpdump crash.\ncould PHP call a python file or something else to launch?\nI have also tried having that .bat file open a New bat file with the livestreamer commands and same thing a crash\n. ok i got this working by adding this into the .bat file\nsetlocal\nSET HOMEDRIVE=\"%~d0%~p0\"\nSET HOMEPATH=\"%~d0%~p0\"\nendlocal\nwhich basically sets those in the bat file for rtmp as the current directory and then will go back to whatever they were before the bat opened up by ending it with \"endlocal\"\n. must have been temporary\n. they are using ioncube\n. is it possible that you still leave a option to add the domain http://www.ilive.to/ or  http://www.streamlive.to\nwas playing with Nightlies and it wont let you do only  http://www.streamlive.to \n. only cause so many of the docs out there and scripts use that address too... thought it be easier to put int your code then replacing in a bat file\n. perfect... should help out a lot of people\n. have you tried the nightlie?  i had mine working\n.

I would  entertain youtube-dl but no idea how to set that up to work without downloading video first\n. where would i make that change or is that something that needs to be done by Chirrpa?\n. sorry but no idea where to put the changes and what directory on a linux box?\nbasically what line do i change in that file above?\n. still missing something here,  sorry but i can't get it working... any help with a working version?\n. chirppa,  it will now play the embedded video but does not work with start and stopping the video can you test that and see what is going on? it works fine in browser but it starts at beginning each time with the start and stop commands\n. :(\n. ok here is what i tried maybe i am missing something?  it keeps saying no data returned command line is like this:\nlivestreamer.exe \"rtmp://master01-na1.click2stream.com:1935/c2s_490 swfUrl=http://players.click2stream.com/jwplayer/5.10/player510.swf live=1 pageUrl=http://click2stream.com\" best\nusing this URL:  http://mbioceancam.click2stream.com/\nthe url snooper is coming back with this also:\nrtmp://sh02-0-na1.click2stream.com/c2s_490\nbut both are coming back no data.... am i missing something?\n. yes this is a great new site! i second this request!\n. where is that Config file in the Livestreamer folder?\n. thanks guys... is there a way to pipe RTMPDUMP to livestreamer?\n. great that may work perfectly using with FFMPEG \n. I was playing with this and i can get the RTMP Url and will play in VLC direct But not Livestreamer, \nso i guess this is closed for now, would be nice to play via Livestreamer\n. oh ok and what about quality settings?  andf how do we know which type each service uses?  thanks!\n. yes i understand that but how do i add that extension to the output file in the .bat file? or am i missing something?\n. that doesnt look available to windows... right now it just saves at best possible \"as is\" correct?  if that is the case i am fine with that, i just was making a bat file and was giving a name with \"date and Time\"  and used .ts and .mp4 and they both seemed to play\n. if i open say ustream with \"best\"  it will save at that quaility that i list...  basically exactly as we see in VLC it will look when saved?\n. thanks!\n. Stream from Plex to live streamer? \n. i made a streamer to send to roku but not sure about plex either  but it seems possible since plex is just a streamer right?\n. give me more info on what your trying to do i have been working on a streamer but need to know what Plex needs to accept as a stream i have it set up for HLS now \n. sorry i meant is it possible to Play the video in FFPLAY or FFMpeg in place of VLC\n. thanks!\n. well i wanted to keep player open if possible but testing again now with the --player-no-close  doesn't work.\nit keeps the window open as it says but without player window closing the .bat file wont execute any farther.\nas soon as player window closes it will continue the loop in the bat file\n. OK but I will need to test when I get home but I don't recall it\nclosing the player at stream end.\nonly when I manually closed VLC would it continue the loop\n. thanks will give that a try tonight and let you know how it goes...  do you know a easy or a way to get cookies in that manner?\n. so in the bat file i should add the directory where the config files are located? or on php?  how would i do either?\n. what exactly am i supposed to be in this ?? \ncan this be put in the bat file as well?  it just needs the folder where the config file is right?\n. ok now what it is doing is not recognizing the rtmp dump i did the following test(s)\n1.) took the folder in application folder that said livestreamer and dragged it to the desktop \n2.) ran the php file, it  then said  at top of the bat file i get this error:\n     Environment variable ---------- not defined\n3.) then it says it cant find rtmp dump.\ni did notice from the php file when i used this command:\nputenv(\"APPDATA=C:\\Documents and Settings\\settop\\Application Data\");\nit created a new \"livestreamer\" folder BUT only added the \"cli.json\" file and not the \"livestreamerrc\" file.\nwhen i put back the old \"livestreamerrc\" in the folder I get a rtmp dump error and it needed to be closed.\n. just in case... i am calling the bat file like this from php:\n$WshShell = new COM(\"WScript.Shell\");\n$oExec  = $WshShell->Run('cmd /C startStreamer.bat', 2, false);\nunset($WshShell, $oExec);\nthe bat is simple:\n@echo on\ncd C:\\Program Files\\Livestreamer\nlivestreamer \"http://www.ilive.to/view/68283\" best\nplays when i use bat alone, the minute i use from the php it just gives me the popup that rtmpdump needs to close... tried getting logs to show but cant seem to get that to work even using --subprocess-errorlog\nany other way i can get you a log info to see what it is?\n. it allows to run in background.... the shell_exec  will wait and hold up the page let me check it out, but it takes a long time to execute leaving window blank..    the other method allows to move on as it works in background\n. what do you mean by keeping it intact?\nso anyways when i change the bat file to this:\n@echo on\nlivestreamer\\rtmpdump.exe  --help \npause\nit doesnt crash... i also used this:\n@echo on\nlivestreamer\\livestreamer.exe --config config.ini --stream-url vaughnlive.tv/arconai701 best >url.txt\npause\nand this is called from PHP with out any issues.  but if i try to play it or save it i get the rtmpdump crash.\ncould PHP call a python file or something else to launch?\nI have also tried having that .bat file open a New bat file with the livestreamer commands and same thing a crash\n. ok i got this working by adding this into the .bat file\nsetlocal\nSET HOMEDRIVE=\"%~d0%~p0\"\nSET HOMEPATH=\"%~d0%~p0\"\nendlocal\nwhich basically sets those in the bat file for rtmp as the current directory and then will go back to whatever they were before the bat opened up by ending it with \"endlocal\"\n. must have been temporary\n. they are using ioncube\n. is it possible that you still leave a option to add the domain http://www.ilive.to/ or  http://www.streamlive.to\nwas playing with Nightlies and it wont let you do only  http://www.streamlive.to \n. only cause so many of the docs out there and scripts use that address too... thought it be easier to put int your code then replacing in a bat file\n. perfect... should help out a lot of people\n. have you tried the nightlie?  i had mine working\n. I pipe mine to FFmpeg  like this for example if it helps:\nlivestreamer.exe  --player-continuous-http --player-no-close \"new.livestream.com/WCIV/live\" best -O | ffmpeg.exe -re -i - -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -ac 1 -strict -2 -crf 18 -profile:v baseline -maxrate 3000k -bufsize 1835k -pix_fmt yuv420p -flags -global_header output.mp4\nyou can change all the settings you want or need in ffmpeg this was just a sample\n. they have changed to http://www.jtvstream.me/\n. i am not trying to be a jerk here or anything but isn't what your doing  not quite \"legal\" anyways? \n. im getting this error\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin streamlive for URL https://www.streamlive.to/v\niew-now/67439/\n[plugin.streamlive][warning] Failed to extract HLS streams: Unable to open URL:\nhttp://#:1935/edge/definst/0i6e1w2q4non031/playlist.m3u8?xs=we_MGk2ZTF3MnE0bm\n9uMDMxfDE0MjI5NzU4MTZ8fDU0ZDA1NmE4ODQ1YTF8MWE1NTdkYjJhYWYxZGY4Y2EyN2E2YmExMDViYT\nljMjdmZDZjZjM5ZQ..

Most streams require the user to be logged in.\n- There are apps available now for various platforms (iOS, Android, Wii U, 3DS, PS4, etc) which may use some kind of API that can be hooked into like the Crunchyroll plugin.\n- The system may treat live broadcasts differently from timeshifted live broadcasts and official live broadcasts.

Finally got round to updating this. I dropped the pvhash parameter for one called pvswf, and if player verification is needed, it caches the hash in ~/.cache/livestreamer/stream.json, which looks a little like this:\n{\"akamaihd-player:http://www.abc.net.au/iview/iview_388.swf\": {\"value\": {\"hash\": \"7ob1gDzeD6B33Q6WHsCoIlv6HQhCmcM4WGc36Y6bD+Q=\", \"modified\": \"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 01:16:58 GMT\"}, \"expires\": 1386558567.4624891}}\nI ended up just manually creating the Cache object when it was needed, because the Stream classes don\u2019t seem to have anything like the Plugin.bind() class method that gets called for each plugin.\n. Yes, verifying the format is not strictly necessary. I was a bit uncertain whether I should include it, but I though it would be good to avoid the chance of storing arbitrary cookie data. If it is a real problem it might be simplest to drop the check, or just check the length or something.\nAccording to RFC 2616, the Last-Modified header (section 14.29) is supposed to be a HTTP-date format, specified in section 3.3.1 as one preferred format and two alternative formats. Using email.utils.parsedate() seemed to cover all three formats.\n@athoik, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to extend your strptime() suggestion to try all three formats, if that is needed. I would tend to try time.strptime() rather than datetime.strptime(), because time is already used in Livestreamer and datetime is not. Do you have a list of what modules may not available, or are you just trying to keep the number of different modules down?\n. Thanks for the list of dependencies, that helps me understand the situation. I was expecting that python-requests already depended on the email package, but in Python 2.7 the httplib module imports mimetools instead. (I know that the Python 3 version does use email.)\nTo avoid fragmentation and to keep things simple, I\u2019d probably go with the single custom implementation unconditionally, rather than checking for the email.utils module. But I just realised that strptime() is probably no good because because it depends on the locale.\n. Hi @K-S-V. No I did not work out the HMAC key myself. I used the value\nI found in your post and in the Pluzz code.

Is there any solution to resolve valid SSL certificate on stream above?\n. Could you tell me by steps where do you disable certificate verification, is it in pycrypto or in command line? Don't forget I am on Windows. ;)\nIf you ever manage to solve this stream with SSL certificate I would be grateful to you forever.;)\n.

But Filmon plugin doesn't support pay service so far. \nTheir so called HD is only 480p so in my opinion it's not worthy to pay and SD is 360p, not huge difference. \n. I use Avidemux. It's simply to use. \n. I confirm all channels I tested drop after 1:30 minutes. Before they worked without interruption. \nLivestreamer doesn't detect anymore HLS stream at all.

Yes you are right I totally forgot about geo blocking. \nFalse warning. \n. @ rubickcz \nYes you are right it's working fine. ;)\nYou did great job, but unfortunatelly it doesn't seem to allow proxy to get over geoblocking restriction. Only CT24 works abroad. \n. @rubickcz \nYou are welcome to join livestreamer fork called streamlink if you want to contribute in further developing. \nI proposed to rename your Czech TV plugin into official name Ceskatelevize to merging into streamlink repositories.. You can still use LIvestreamer, just copy and paste https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/blob/master/src/streamlink/plugins/twitch.py in plugins directory and edit it by replacing \"streamink\" to \"livestreamer\" save it and it should work normally. \n. I gave you alternative choice which is a little bit more complicated to settle. \nFollow what @tp0 mentionned above. \nFirst Uninstall Livestreamer from Program and Functionalities, then install Streamlink from here : \nhttps://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases\nand try it with command : streamlink. \nMake sure you have this file \"C:\\Usersyour username\\AppData\\Roaming\\streamlinkrc\" and remove folder named 'livestreamerrc\". \n. Livestreamer doesn't support so far hds encrypted streams.\n. I don't think it was abandoned as long original creator doesn't claim otherwise. \n. Ilive is broken again.

Livestreamer uses requests internally, which respects the env variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY, see http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies\nFor instance how can I open this stream with livestreamer through proxy in command line? I prefer to use livestreamer cos unlike VLC it doesn't consume much CPU on M3U8 streams that's why I am really interested. \nWhen I open it through VLC it goes like that : \nvlc --http-proxy=84.22.58.149:3128 \"http://edge2.vektor.net/vektor_live/bn.stream/playlist.m3u8\"\nI guess livestreamer doesn't have a HTTP proxy switch built. \nThanks\n. I use right now Windows. Could you explain me is there any chance to put different HTTP proxy only for several streams and not for all ? I made myself batch file with streams.\nToo bad you didn't include http proxy switch in livestreamer it would be much easier to do it as in Windows it only works for one session only and you can use it for only one stream. \n. Thank you very much, it is work good. Is this windows command one process only HTTP_PROXY also working on Linux if not could you also provide it cos it can be very useful. \nWhy do you use \"hlsvariant\" instead of just \"hls\" for this kind of streams ?\nThanks again ,)\n.

I guess rtmp doesn't accept headers feature. \n. It's because they use rtmp protocol, so far only hls protocol is suppported on Livestream plugin. \n. They need to make reverse engineering for rtmp protocol in livestream and I guess it's not so easy that's why it's not implemented so far. \n.

Just tested, working fine to me. \n. If you want to play Dreambox  with livestreamer, you need to put this : \n\nlivestreamer \"httpstream://http://192.168.1.200:8001/1:0:1:13F6:5DC:13E:820000:0:0:0:\" best\n. Could you add also support for HLS stream in this plugin ?\n. No problems here. \n. Yeah you are right to me it even drops after 4 minutes. I figure out it's related to HQ time limit which is 3 minutes for free preview. LQ works fine. \nThat's log messages I had when stream dropped out. \nlivestreamer \"hls://http://198.179.30.109/live/14.high.stream/playlist.m3u8?id=0ad5aac39bb13f\nbe8ba0913b6d38c1a9cef06b3eb703242089abd2dba0860214d213cee0ddc7fb7b21e2b290948f4e\ne295712d4c02569fda7cb2867a5151d7abf688a1fab385a8a4357fe3612c2c2240f4866c34a06360\n3a717497db5902442b5dab3411c931d88e539120b2782f7599c5fb345e4fe9f3525af4d6d33de32b\nbfe569ef5b8c1058313c93accbb558574c894741bc4f289b24\" best\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin stream for URL hls://http://198.179.30.109/liv\ne/14.high.stream/playlist.m3u8?id=0ad5aac39bb13fbe8ba0913b6d38c1a9cef06b3eb70324\n2089abd2dba0860214d213cee0ddc7fb7b21e2b290948f4ee295712d4c02569fda7cb2867a5151d7\nabf688a1fab385a8a4357fe3612c2c2240f4866c34a063603a717497db5902442b5dab3411c931d8\n8e539120b2782f7599c5fb345e4fe9f3525af4d6d33de32bbfe569ef5b8c1058313c93accbb55857\n4c894741bc4f289b24\n[cli][info] Available streams: live (worst, best)\n[cli][info] Opening stream: live (hls)\n[cli][info] Starting player: 'C:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe'\n[stream.hls][warning] Failed to reload playlist: Unable to open URL: http://198.\n179.30.109/live/14.high.stream/playlist.m3u8?id=0ad5aac39bb13fbe8ba0913b6d38c1a9\ncef06b3eb703242089abd2dba0860214d213cee0ddc7fb7b21e2b290948f4ee295712d4c02569fda\n7cb2867a5151d7abf688a1fab385a8a4357fe3612c2c2240f4866c34a063603a717497db5902442b\n5dab3411c931d88e539120b2782f7599c5fb345e4fe9f3525af4d6d33de32bbfe569ef5b8c105831\n3c93accbb558574c894741bc4f289b24 (502 Server Error: Expired)\n. I didn't watch much Filmon so far but all I know in the past HQ worked without interruption. \nUnless you subscribe to their service you will not have any interruptions. But Filmon plugin doesn't support pay service so far. \nTheir so called HD is only 480p so in my opinion it's not worthy to pay and SD is 360p, not huge difference. \n. I use Avidemux. It's simply to use. \n. I confirm all channels I tested drop after 1:30 minutes. Before they worked without interruption. \nLivestreamer doesn't detect anymore HLS stream at all.

Only CT24 works abroad. \n. @rubickcz \nYou are welcome to join livestreamer fork called streamlink if you want to contribute in further developing. \nI proposed to rename your Czech TV plugin into official name Ceskatelevize to merging into streamlink repositories.. You can still use LIvestreamer, just copy and paste https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/blob/master/src/streamlink/plugins/twitch.py in plugins directory and edit it by replacing \"streamink\" to \"livestreamer\" save it and it should work normally. \n. I gave you alternative choice which is a little bit more complicated to settle. \nFollow what @tp0 mentionned above. \nFirst Uninstall Livestreamer from Program and Functionalities, then install Streamlink from here : \nhttps://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases\nand try it with command : streamlink. \nMake sure you have this file \"C:\\Usersyour username\\AppData\\Roaming\\streamlinkrc\" and remove folder named 'livestreamerrc\". \n. Livestreamer doesn't support so far hds encrypted streams.\n. I don't think it was abandoned as long original creator doesn't claim otherwise. \n. ",

Would be good to post that info on python-librtmp repo.\nThe reason I wanted to try python-librtmp is to get needed rtmp info from livestream flash player:\nhttp://cdn.livestream.com/chromelessPlayer/v21/playerapi.swf\nViewed with Softlink SWF Decompiler I see some functions that might help. Still would need to find a way to call them though. Wonder if python-librtmp will help with that.\n. That's truly sad. Maybe in future I can salvage those files.\nRegarding RTMP support I did something that manages to get RTMP stream thanks to python-librtmp.\nProblem is it's very unreliable, it assumes a lot. Also there should be published mobile api HLS streams anyway to get last part of stream name. I could not figure out how to get it otherwise, it's something that their player does internally I guess. Wireshark didn't capture anything that could help with that.\nHere's a little wip app I made to download them (python script):\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!pB0mFbbK!INmLcCq-Ste3M_uqDtcAsQ0sp9h2q2pLsrbPVTEQeAY\nOnly affiliate streams are supported for now too. There are several for mogulus alone as can be seen from decompiled part of their player:\nactionscript3\nprivate function getStreamName() : String{\n    var _loc_1:* = null;\n    if (this.forceStreamName){\n        return this.forceStreamName;\n    }\n    if (this._isServersideMix){\n        _loc_1 = ChannelConstants.getStreamMixingURL(this._originURL) + \"/\" + this._id;\n    }\n    else if (this._affiliateURI){\n        _loc_1 = ChannelConstants.getAffiliateStreamPublishURL(this._originURL) + \"/\" + this.encodeToHex(\"liverepeater:\" + this._affiliateURI);\n    }\n    else {\n        _loc_1 = ChannelConstants.getMainStreamPublishURL(this._originURL) + \"/\" + this._id;\n    }\n    return _loc_1;\n}\n.

I have to give karlo2105 right; there was an error in my PATH so it opened with v1.10.2,\nwith v1.11.1 it doesn\u2019t.  (10 jan. -15)\n(Old message:)\nI can\u2019t make that one work either.\nHere in Sweden it\u2019s opening as usual with [http://www.rtve.es/noticias/directo-la-1/].\n. --http-headers works here so it\u2019s especially interesting.\nEDIT.   17/1 -15\n...or am i confusing it with Hola ?

X-Forwarded-For seems a bit coming and going in Firefox.\nWhen (site) FB Host still was active before Henry unfortunately died, it worked with X-Forwarded-For.\n.

In case this is another .m3u8 issue I\u2019m also putting it here:\n[http://ltlive01.cloudapp.net/LT_CH_5miu4ca67.isml/QualityLevels(1264000)/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl).m3u8] opens but freezes immediately.\n. This one [http://83.169.58.38:1935/live/Stream3/playlist.m3u8] plays fine in MPlayer with an unusually large picture, but through [livestreamer.exe hlsvariant://http://83.169.58.38:1935/live/Stream3/playlist.m3u8 best] not so good and burdens heavy on the CPU. \nIs there a trick ?\nIt originates from [http://de.iphone-tv.eu//stream/de/50]. Haven\u2019t checked its homepage. \nEdit.\nThe channel changes from being \u201cFamily TV\u201d to \u201cjoiz\u201d, \"123 tv\" etc. \nNow it plays better, except some minor faults, but is uninteresting to me.\n.

So how did your link/ path look ?\n. VLC is such a default player for me so I\u2019m not even thinking in terms of other players.\nTried: MPV (both) ->(Failed to start player [Process exited prematurely] ), PotPlayer \nbut worked only once, RealPlayer Cloud, Simple Player, QuickTime, fhe latest free WinAmp, WMP. \nI will put up an Issue on the VLC Forum.\n.

Seems to be an issue with VLC. I have tested it with two different media players: MPC-HC and VLC. First I tried to play the stream directly with both media players. No problems so far with MPC-HC, but with VLC the video freezes immediately. VLC output log shows:\ncore warning: early picture skipped\ncore debug: discarded audio buffer\nSame happens when I try to watch the stream with Livestreamer and VLC.

expected.\n. @liamkennedy \nTo be honest, I don't know. You said playback was reliable in the past. I don't think it is related to the Livestreamer application, but I might be wrong. I don't see any error messages in your logs. What I can see is the player closes after downloading a few chunks. The question is why.\nWhat happens if you try to use another player (or the file output option)?\n. @jthall \n\nI ran livestreamer with the -O flag like this \nlivestreamer -l debug -O http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-media-channel 720p+ >media.flv\nand then let it run for a while until I saw several loading module msgs, then once it started receiving chunks again I viewed the file in vlc.\n\nHow long exactly? I'm asking because I don't see any of these messages (see my log above). Are you talking about these warning messages [Failed to process module info: Failed to get module info: Timeout] which can be seen here? Looks more like an network issue for me.\nThe strange thing is, if something has changed on the Ustream side, I would have the same problem (with Windows), but that's not the case!\n@liamkennedy \n\nJust curious - Do you have a Raspberry Pi to test this for yourself?\n\nUnfortunately I'm not able to test it on Raspberry Pi.\nYou said you are experiencing the same problems (jumps / breaks in the video) like jthall, but I don't see any of these warning messages in your logs. Could this be because the omxplayer stops before some of these warning messages show up?\n. I did some further testing using the file output option (360p (uhs) stream). I did not see any error message, but the downloaded video has definitely some jumps / breaks in it. And that may be the cause, why the omxplayer stops.\n. Now it's getting really strange. I was trying it again on another channel (http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-educational):\nlivestreamer \"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-educational\" 240p -l debug -o 240p.flv\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin ustreamtv for URL http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-educational\n[plugin.ustreamtv][debug] Waiting for moduleInfo invoke\n[cli][info] Available streams: 240p, 240p_alt_akamai, 720p+ (best), 720p+_alt_akamai, mobile_240p (worst)\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 240p (uhs)\nSaved the file to disk and played it with MPC-HC. This time, no jumps / breaks. The video runs perfectly.\nUpdate:\nThe 720p+ (uhs) stream seems to be problematic too. Quite confusing. Both are UHS streams, the only difference is the resolution.\n. I assume all FLV files (chunks) are downloaded correctly (no error messages are shown).\nhttp://ams-ucdn02.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs25/streams/httpflv/ustreamVideo/10208765/streams/live_1_1434527278_913536015.flv\nhttp://ams-ucdn02.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs25/streams/httpflv/ustreamVideo/10208765/streams/live_1_1434527279_913536015.flv\nhttp://ams-ucdn02.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs25/streams/httpflv/ustreamVideo/10208765/streams/live_1_1434527280_913536015.flv\nMaybe the problem lies in how these files are joined into one single FLV file?\nUpdate:\nNo there are missing chunks too (when downloading the 720p+ UHS stream). At least the 240p UHS stream is working fine for me.\n. I think the main problem (missing chunks) is clear now. This is the reason why some players drop out (e.g. omxplayer). Other media players (e.g. VLC, MPC-HC) are able to handle that, but playback is horrible.\n\nDo we think the problem is in the ustream plugin or librtmp python library?\n\nI don't know. I can see some activity on port 1935 (RTMP) while Livestreamer is running.\n\nIf you run the 240p feed for a long time like half an hour, do you see one massive gap or is the player somehow able to keep up?\n\nI will do some further testing and report back.\n. > Plus by capturing it to a file and then playing it back, you have the ability to stall out for a long time, then fetch a whole bunch of chunks at faster-than-real-time and catch up. If, on the other htand, you are playing it out in real-time, I suspect the 240P feeds will pause as well, although admittedly it doesn't seem to be as bad as the other hd feeds, so maybe there reall yaren't any gaps after all.\nYour assumption is correct. Playback is horrible in real-time. It makes no difference whether I use VLC or MPC-HC. Only the file output option gives me a playable file without jumps / breaks.\n. This is a complicated question. We are dealing with several problems at once.\n1. There are missing chunks which are not downloaded by Livestreamer. Output log indicates that. I didn't noticed it first because no error message was shown. \nExample (Module info removed):\n[stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042915 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042916 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042917 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042918 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042919 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042920 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042921 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042922 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042919 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042920 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042921 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042922 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042925 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042926 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042927 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042928 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042925 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042926 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042927 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042928 complete\nMissing chunks: 1436042923, 1436042924\n2. The chunks are not delivered fast enough to the player. This results in a break while the player is waiting for the next chunk. (#265)\n3. Only a small amount of chunks are fetched at once. I think we should fetch as much chunks as we can. (Maybe not possible: See point 4 and 5)\n4. How do we get the full path to each chunk?

My first impression is: It seems to run much better than before. All chunks are retrieved correctly. I think the main problem (missing chunks) has been fixed now. I'm still getting some warning messages (Failed to process module info: Failed to get module info: Timeout) (strangely enough only on some channels e.g. NASA media channel) but this seems to have no negative impact. I need to do some further tests to see if it works reliable (even on other channels).

I can aim at someone from 2-3 feet away in the face and nothing registers.\nIf you are running both applications at the same time and your internet connection is not fast enough, it may result in a higher latency / ping and that can cause lag. For someone who plays tactical online shooters you should actually know that.\n. > And, models becoming moving fixed objects in the game isn't a ping issue.\nNo? What else should it be, if it's not a connection problem? If the game runs normal but all other players are not moving (like you describe it), it has definitely something to do with your latency / ping.\nI'm not talking about the sound issues. That could be something else.\n. > I had some weird issues with games too when VLC was using DirectX/Direct3D/Direct2D for video output.\nHis own ingame sound is fine (he just can't hear the sounds from other players).\nI still think it is a connection problem.

Headers are passed correctly (also for HLS key requests). I have tested this successfully some time ago.\n. To quickly check what's going on, you can use tools like Wireshark. Monitoring your network traffic while Livestreamer is running, will certainly point you in the right direction.\nI don't know what's going on in your case, but if the key file inside the playlist points to wrong URL, Livestreamer won't be able to request the key properly (#1097).

Livestreamers Azubu.tv plugin does not support HLS streams. In this case your attempt would be useless. They are using Akamai HD streams (similar to Livestream.com) and this may be the reason why you are experiencing the same problems. The server closes the connection after a certain amount of data has been send. I'm not sure if there are other stream types available, which could be implemented in the plugin. I haven't looked into it.\n. @NeoFahrenheit \nHLS streams are available too. Could be useful to bypass the 2GB limit.\nyoutube-dl -F \"http://www.azubu.tv/Starfire\"\n[AzubuLive] Starfire: Downloading JSON metadata\n[AzubuLive] Starfire: Downloading JSON metadata\n[AzubuLive] Starfire: Downloading m3u8 information\n[info] Available formats for 190049:\nformat code  extension  resolution note\nmeta         mp4        multiple   Quality selection URL\n250          mp4        480x270     250k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.42001e\n500          mp4        640x360     500k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.4d001e\n1000         mp4        854x480    1000k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.42001e\n2400         mp4        1280x720   2400k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.4d001f\n3300         mp4        1920x1080  3300k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.640028 (best)\nyoutube-dl -g \"http://www.azubu.tv/Starfire\"\nhttp://azubuhlslivesp2-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/223591/hls-saopaulo-2_2/video190049CHStarfire/3300/azevinho.m3u8\nlivestreamer \"hls://http://azubuhlslivesp2-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/223591/hls-saopaulo-2_2/video190049CHStarfire/3300/azevinho.m3u8\" best -o Azubu.ts\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin stream for URL hls://http://azubuhlslivesp2-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/223591/hls-saopaulo-2_2/video190049CHStarfire/3300/azevinho.m3u8\n[cli][info] Available streams: live (worst, best)\n[cli][info] Opening stream: live (hls)\n.

expected.\n. @liamkennedy \nTo be honest, I don't know. You said playback was reliable in the past. I don't think it is related to the Livestreamer application, but I might be wrong. I don't see any error messages in your logs. What I can see is the player closes after downloading a few chunks. The question is why.\nWhat happens if you try to use another player (or the file output option)?\n. @jthall \n\nI ran livestreamer with the -O flag like this \nlivestreamer -l debug -O http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-media-channel 720p+ >media.flv\nand then let it run for a while until I saw several loading module msgs, then once it started receiving chunks again I viewed the file in vlc.\n\nHow long exactly? I'm asking because I don't see any of these messages (see my log above). Are you talking about these warning messages [Failed to process module info: Failed to get module info: Timeout] which can be seen here? Looks more like an network issue for me.\nThe strange thing is, if something has changed on the Ustream side, I would have the same problem (with Windows), but that's not the case!\n@liamkennedy \n\nJust curious - Do you have a Raspberry Pi to test this for yourself?\n\nUnfortunately I'm not able to test it on Raspberry Pi.\nYou said you are experiencing the same problems (jumps / breaks in the video) like jthall, but I don't see any of these warning messages in your logs. Could this be because the omxplayer stops before some of these warning messages show up?\n. I did some further testing using the file output option (360p (uhs) stream). I did not see any error message, but the downloaded video has definitely some jumps / breaks in it. And that may be the cause, why the omxplayer stops.\n. Now it's getting really strange. I was trying it again on another channel (http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-educational):\nlivestreamer \"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-educational\" 240p -l debug -o 240p.flv\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin ustreamtv for URL http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-educational\n[plugin.ustreamtv][debug] Waiting for moduleInfo invoke\n[cli][info] Available streams: 240p, 240p_alt_akamai, 720p+ (best), 720p+_alt_akamai, mobile_240p (worst)\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 240p (uhs)\nSaved the file to disk and played it with MPC-HC. This time, no jumps / breaks. The video runs perfectly.\nUpdate:\nThe 720p+ (uhs) stream seems to be problematic too. Quite confusing. Both are UHS streams, the only difference is the resolution.\n. I assume all FLV files (chunks) are downloaded correctly (no error messages are shown).\nhttp://ams-ucdn02.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs25/streams/httpflv/ustreamVideo/10208765/streams/live_1_1434527278_913536015.flv\nhttp://ams-ucdn02.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs25/streams/httpflv/ustreamVideo/10208765/streams/live_1_1434527279_913536015.flv\nhttp://ams-ucdn02.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs25/streams/httpflv/ustreamVideo/10208765/streams/live_1_1434527280_913536015.flv\nMaybe the problem lies in how these files are joined into one single FLV file?\nUpdate:\nNo there are missing chunks too (when downloading the 720p+ UHS stream). At least the 240p UHS stream is working fine for me.\n. I think the main problem (missing chunks) is clear now. This is the reason why some players drop out (e.g. omxplayer). Other media players (e.g. VLC, MPC-HC) are able to handle that, but playback is horrible.\n\nDo we think the problem is in the ustream plugin or librtmp python library?\n\nI don't know. I can see some activity on port 1935 (RTMP) while Livestreamer is running.\n\nIf you run the 240p feed for a long time like half an hour, do you see one massive gap or is the player somehow able to keep up?\n\nI will do some further testing and report back.\n. > Plus by capturing it to a file and then playing it back, you have the ability to stall out for a long time, then fetch a whole bunch of chunks at faster-than-real-time and catch up. If, on the other htand, you are playing it out in real-time, I suspect the 240P feeds will pause as well, although admittedly it doesn't seem to be as bad as the other hd feeds, so maybe there reall yaren't any gaps after all.\nYour assumption is correct. Playback is horrible in real-time. It makes no difference whether I use VLC or MPC-HC. Only the file output option gives me a playable file without jumps / breaks.\n. This is a complicated question. We are dealing with several problems at once.\n1. There are missing chunks which are not downloaded by Livestreamer. Output log indicates that. I didn't noticed it first because no error message was shown. \nExample (Module info removed):\n[stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042915 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042916 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042917 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042918 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042919 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042920 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042921 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042922 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042919 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042920 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042921 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042922 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042925 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042926 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042927 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436042928 to queue\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042925 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042926 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042927 complete\n   [stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436042928 complete\nMissing chunks: 1436042923, 1436042924\n2.

My first impression is: It seems to run much better than before. All chunks are retrieved correctly. I think the main problem (missing chunks) has been fixed now. I'm still getting some warning messages (Failed to process module info: Failed to get module info: Timeout) (strangely enough only on some channels e.g. NASA media channel) but this seems to have no negative impact. I need to do some further tests to see if it works reliable (even on other channels).

Ustreams own streaming protocol is way more complex than you think. The whole stream is splitted into a huge amount of chunks. They do their best to prevent access to their streams.

I can aim at someone from 2-3 feet away in the face and nothing registers.\nIf you are running both applications at the same time and your internet connection is not fast enough, it may result in a higher latency / ping and that can cause lag. For someone who plays tactical online shooters you should actually know that.\n. > And, models becoming moving fixed objects in the game isn't a ping issue.\nNo? What else should it be, if it's not a connection problem? If the game runs normal but all other players are not moving (like you describe it), it has definitely something to do with your latency / ping.\nI'm not talking about the sound issues. That could be something else.\n. > I had some weird issues with games too when VLC was using DirectX/Direct3D/Direct2D for video output.\nHis own ingame sound is fine (he just can't hear the sounds from other players).\nI still think it is a connection problem.

Headers are passed correctly (also for HLS key requests). I have tested this successfully some time ago.\n. To quickly check what's going on, you can use tools like Wireshark. Monitoring your network traffic while Livestreamer is running, will certainly point you in the right direction.\nI don't know what's going on in your case, but if the key file inside the playlist points to wrong URL, Livestreamer won't be able to request the key properly (#1097).

Livestreamers Azubu.tv plugin does not support HLS streams. In this case your attempt would be useless. They are using Akamai HD streams (similar to Livestream.com) and this may be the reason why you are experiencing the same problems. The server closes the connection after a certain amount of data has been send. I'm not sure if there are other stream types available, which could be implemented in the plugin. I haven't looked into it.\n. @NeoFahrenheit \nHLS streams are available too. Could be useful to bypass the 2GB limit.\nyoutube-dl -F \"http://www.azubu.tv/Starfire\"\n[AzubuLive] Starfire: Downloading JSON metadata\n[AzubuLive] Starfire: Downloading JSON metadata\n[AzubuLive] Starfire: Downloading m3u8 information\n[info] Available formats for 190049:\nformat code  extension  resolution note\nmeta         mp4        multiple   Quality selection URL\n250          mp4        480x270     250k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.42001e\n500          mp4        640x360     500k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.4d001e\n1000         mp4        854x480    1000k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.42001e\n2400         mp4        1280x720   2400k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.4d001f\n3300         mp4        1920x1080  3300k , mp4a.40.2,  avc1.640028 (best)\nyoutube-dl -g \"http://www.azubu.tv/Starfire\"\nhttp://azubuhlslivesp2-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/223591/hls-saopaulo-2_2/video190049CHStarfire/3300/azevinho.m3u8\nlivestreamer \"hls://http://azubuhlslivesp2-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/223591/hls-saopaulo-2_2/video190049CHStarfire/3300/azevinho.m3u8\" best -o Azubu.ts\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin stream for URL hls://http://azubuhlslivesp2-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/223591/hls-saopaulo-2_2/video190049CHStarfire/3300/azevinho.m3u8\n[cli][info] Available streams: live (worst, best)\n[cli][info] Opening stream: live (hls)\n.

(Yet another new comment instead of edit, incase you see these via email... :D)\nTry to sniff the URL again (hint: browser dev tools & network tab is enough) and get this instead:\nhttp://srgssruni13ch-lh.akamaihd.net/z/enc13uni_ch@191855/manifest.f4m?hdnts=exp%3D1459094735~acl%3D%2Fz%2Fenc13uni_ch%40191855%2F*~hmac%3Db80eb816ae0dfb876af47d9bcbbf0602ce5738e623b5b60f728123b91c1f0dd7&g=RXVYYEUTNHXI&hdcore=3.7.0&plugin=aasp-3.7.0.39.44\nThe try this sort of format:\nlivestreamer \"hds://URL_LIKE_ABOVE_HERE pvswf=URL_TO_FLASHPLAYER.swf\" best\nFind the flash player path from page source or via dev tools. I can't test this anyway as I only have Tunnelbear browser addon.\n. I think the first swf path looks right. Do you do this quickly enough? Sometimes the cookie can expire really quickly.\n. Probably possible with an actual script. Not really a Livestreamer issue. Ask this nicely on unix.stackexchange.com and someone will probably do the script for you. :D\n. > Is there any way to record a short clip from stream? which option should I use, if I want to record to file a short clip for 1 minute for example?\nJust stop recording after 1 minute? But I don't think you can set the exact start time, especially if it is a live stream. Easier would be to record longer clip and then cut it with any video tool you want to use. \n. Post the wall of text? If too long post it here: https://gist.github.com\n. Downloading works with youtube-dl but the resulting file is unplayable. DRM/scrambling?\n.

If it is possible, it'd be nice to gain access to the 1080p/60fps options.\nThis is an old and known issue... Livestreamer simply does not support the 60 fps streams yet (the framerate itself isn't an issue, but Youtube outputs them differently).\n1080p / 30fps is supported, but not sure if this is available when the stream maximum is 60 fps.\n. Is there a specific feature you use on VLC why you want to stick to VLC? Assuming Windows, try MPC-HC.\n. You might be interested in:\nhttps://github.com/jonian/acestream-launcher\nhttps://github.com/jonian/acestream-proxy-player\n. Why do you want to use it this way, won't it be ridiculously slow?\nDo you just want to bypass a geoblock restriction? --http-header \"X-Forwarded-For=<IP_ADDRESS>\" may be enough for that.\n. > Is there anyway to seek youtube videos/vods currently?\nWhich player? Works for me (mpv, smplayer, bomi).\n. Twitch plugin is apparently broken. Move to https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink which is an improved fork as this orginal Livestreamer has been abandoned. With Streamlink 720p60 works without that client-id trick. \n. ",

    "RuKeBo": "How do you use this script?  When I run it, I get this error.  I don't know know anything about python.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"fixit.py\", line 3, in \n    from livestreamer.packages import flashmedia\nImportError: No module named 'livestreamer'\nI have a file that I needed to end pre-maturely and wanted to see if this would fix it.\n. Yes, on Windows and I tried that.  Used the command \"c:\\Python33\\python fixit.py test.flv\".  I think I need an output file as well but I don't think that is not going to correct the error.\n. Yeah, that worked.  Strange thing though.  I recorded a stream but it did not end from one broadcast to another, normally it ends then starts another.  So I had to stop it manually which gave the incorrect duration (00:00).  Running the script works but appears to stop at the end of the first broadcast, the file is much smaller, and when I view it, the \"fixed\" file ends after the first broadcast.  Besides not getting the whole file, it is the second broadcast I would need since the first was started somewhere in  progress and the second was stopped after it ended, there may be a third or more in the file.  Not asking for a fix or saying anything is wrong, just noting what it is doing. \nAlso tried script on large file.  The duration of file was over 1:59:00 but it would only play about 10 minutes, to the end of the first broadcast.  File size was much smaller as well.\n. As a side note:  I used FLVExtact to extract the audio and video and then MP$Box to mux them back together and the resulting file, while perfectly viewable, is not the full length of the video in the file.  Seems to be an issue with the files.\n. This may ultimately be an issue for me with the veetle plugin or stream.  The stream never ends, meaning livestreamer will go on indefinitely.  This may be that the actual stream switches to another broadcast (movie or other video) but doesn't actually end, or livestreamer does not pick it up.  This seems consistent across all vettle streams.  However, the output file will be truncated when viewing to the end of the first broadcast or earlier.  The file will be of no duration, if fixed, the duration is much less than it should be.  I can never play the file past that point.  I used many programs to try and fix the file or get the full duration but all of them, including your script, truncate the file to the same length.  I was able to inject a duration with Flvtool2, converted that file to an mp4 to see what would happen, and the duration was over two hours but it will still only show the first 9 minutes.  When I run your script on the file, it only outputs the first 9 minutes, as do all other programs I've tried.  This particular file was a movie and I started livestreamer at the beginning of it, ended it just before it ended.  At 9:32 something happened to the flv file.  It is over 880,000KB in size.  Your script reduces it to almost 81,000KB, which makes sense because it is only 9:32 minutes long.  For some reason, it put an end to the file, or something at 9:32.  Normally it would do this at the end of the broadcast, but continue to output more, which I can never see.  Very peculiar.\n. I tried this with the build \"livestreamer-v1.7.5-65-g752eaaa-win32.zip\" and it appeared to work ok for awhile.  But after maybe 45 minutes, it gave me the following errors (same error several times):\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin ustreamtv for URL http://www.ustream.tv/creati\nveLIVE-rebroadcast\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 720p\nWritten 287375499 bytes[stream.uhs][error] Failed to open chunk 1395191177: Unab\nle to open URL: http://uhs-live-default.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs23/streams/httpflv/ust\nreamVideo/952665/streams/live_1_1395191177_1155237609.flv (404 Client Error: Not\n Found)\n[stream.uhs][error] Failed to open chunk 1395191177: Unable to open URL: http://\nuhs-live-default.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs23/streams/httpflv/ustreamVideo/952665/stream\ns/live_1_1395191177_1155237609.flv (404 Client Error: Not Found) \netc....this occurred around 12 times. \nThe URL it lists is not a valid URL, not sure where it got it from.\nI would then get the following error when I tried to play it with VLC:\nNo suitable decoder module:\nVLC does not support the audio or video format \"undf\". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.\nThe file will play audio, but no video.\nI need to do some more testing to see if this is a time dependent thing, I know it happened as soon as I started livestreamer one time, but not usually.  I was outputting to a file, not to VLC directly.  Funny thing is, I was using RTMPDump and RTMPSuck for awhile, but Usteam must have changed something recently since RMTPSuck won't work on it anymore but livestreamer does, to a point.  I can't find the command line string for RTMPDump.\nAlso, not sure if this is normal, but the \"Written\" size increases fast for a short time, then stops for some time.  It appears that when this stops, the file gets written to.  I believe this may cause the end of the output file to get truncated when the stream ends since it exits before the file is fully written.  I still need to test this more.  \nThanks\n.

I am not sure any of this is helping, but I ran three instances of livestreamer.  Was curious if they would throw an error at the same time. The second instance was started within seconds of the first.  The third was started 20-30 seconds after that.  Test1 & Test2 added the same chunks and wrote the stream at the same time (close to it), they basically outputted the same thing.  The third one also added the same chunks to queue but obviously the file written was different.  They all outputted adding the same chunks at the same time minus some lag between them.  I assumed the chunks would be different depending on when they were started, but I don't know anything about how this works, just an interesting observation.  I left them to run and the end of the output is below.  You can see how they all ended differently, I only posted the end of the output.  I assume this means that it is sort of random as to when it gets the \"Read timeout\" error\", they did not all error at the same time as I expected. All end with 10 \"Adding chunk to queue\" again.\nTest1 - Started first\nWritten 1458799740 bytes[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448207 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448208 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448209 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448210 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448211 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448212 to queue\n[cli][error] Error when reading from stream: Read timeout\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448213 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448214 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448215 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448216 to queue\nTest2 - Start a few seconds after Test1\nWritten 1063221731 bytes[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447921 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447922 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447923 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447924 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447925 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447926 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447927 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447928 to queue\n[cli][error] Error when reading from stream: Read timeout\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447929 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447930 to queue\nTest 3 - Started 20-30 seconds after Test1\nWritten 2366752782 bytes[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448867 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448868 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448869 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448870 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448871 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448872 to queue\n[cli][error] Error when reading from stream: Read timeout\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448873 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448874 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448875 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448876 to queue\n.

This might be interesting.  I had two instances of livestreamer running at the same time, one with \"best\" and the other with  \"720+_alt_akami\".   Both gave errors for the same chunks and it tried to open them 3 times but failed, it did this for several chunks.  The errors for each were different though, maybe this is expected.  The \"best\" option seems to work well for some time.  It can go hours with just an error now and then for failing to open a chunk once, but it gets it the next try.  Then all of the sudden it does what is shown below.\n\"720+_alt_akami\"\n[stream.uhs][error] Failed to open chunk 1395511570: Unable to open URL:

1395511575 complete\n. Is there a way for me to implement the requests latest build into livestreamer to test this.  I know nothing about Python but I tried it by downloaded the latest requests which appeared to have the \"timeout\" feature implemented in \"adapters.py\".  I compiled the files in the requests folder and copied them to the livestreamer requests folder.  I didn't notice anything different.  Or does this need to be implemented somehow in livestreamer in a later release?\nUsing the 720p+ stream gives me a a lot of lost chunks.  Using 720p+_alt_akamai works better, but it seems to always cut off the last 10 seconds or so of the stream if I save to a file.  It also seems to loose the first few seconds (not sure how many, maybe 10) of the beginning.  I restart livestreamer (in a loop) when the stream ends and use --retry-streams 1 until it picks it up again.  This works pretty well, but sometimes, not always, it looses the end and/or beginning.  I have also tried it without --retry-streams and just had it wait for 10 seconds before restarting.  I have changed this time but it sometimes still misses the beginning.  It is possible it is the stream.  When using 720p+_alt_akamai, sometimes it will find a mobile stream but not the 720p stream for several tries.\nI should try the above while viewing a second instance with VLC and see if that gets cut off as well.\n. I assumed that since you mentioned what is below, that the timeout issue would be solved.  maybe it was a different time out issue.\n\nIt looks like the thread that is responsible for fetching the segments gets stuck. Most likely what happens is that the HTTP request never times out, which is probably caused by a bug currently existing in the HTTP library we use (requests) where the timeout is not applied to streaming responses (it will be fixed in the next version though).\n\nI was referring to this: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1803, but it could be unrelated.  It was just a timeout issue they were dealing with so I assumed it was the one you mentioned.\n. Just curious, is the change to use non-streaming the best way to do it?  Will it be reverted back the way it was before at some point in the future or remain this way?\n. Let me know if this is something that might be an issue in how things are handled in the plugin, or occurs for some other reason.  I open livestreamer and have the ustream stream playing in VLC.  I also have the same stream open in a browser window on Ustream.tv.  The livestreamer stream in VLC is about 10 seconds behind the browser stream, which is not really an issue, that I know of.  However, the browser stream will end and then the VLC stream will, a few seconds later, which means the livestreamer stream does not play to the end of the actual stream.  This happens the same in an output file, it cuts off the end.\nDoes the stream end because it in fact ended and it stops livestreamer immediately, but since it is about 10 seconds behind, it cuts it off?  Did the stream end and it didn't have the time to write or show the rest of the stream?  I am assuming from what you said here:\n\nI've pushed a workaround that will attempt to downlaod the whole segment in one go which should make the timeout work correctly. Downside with this approach is that we have to wait for each segment to be fully downloaded before it can be sent to the player.\n\n...that maybe, and this is pure speculation, that it might be trying to download the next segment, the stream ends, then it stops.  If outputting to a file, it gets truncated.  If in a  player, it ends before finishing.  Just curious. \n. This appears to work better now.  It appears to be capturing to the end of the stream.\nThanks\n. I am getting some peculiar results with this now.  Some things seem to be worked out.  But for the most part, the issues come at the start or end of a stream.  I am using the --retry-streams option and at times it won't capture the beginning of cuts off the end.  I am going to assume that this is either an issue with the stream, as sometimes it works perfectly, or possibly the implementation per this:\n\nAbout your issues, it is likely my implementation is slightly wrong since it's based purely on analyzing the network traffic. I have to decompile the flash player to get a better look how this works, but haven't gotten around to it yet.\n\nThe other issue that is more peculiar, is that it, at times, will not sync the audio and video.  I was trying to do some testing on this but think it only occurs when outputed to a file, not to VLC.  At some point in the video, the video jumps and it appears the audio does as well, and then they are out of sync after that.  This does not happen all the time and I don't get an error.  I tried it with the debug option and I don't see it doing anything peculiar, maybe it is \"fetching module info\" more in a row than it normally does, but not sure.  The stream it was doing it on is not online anymore so I can't test it on the stream it was occurring on.\nAnything I can keep a look out for or test to narrow this down?\n. > I did some testing by sending a stream myself to ustream and it seems there is a delay from where I start the stream on my end and when ustream will let me access it, it's usually between 15 and 30 seconds, is that what you're seeing?\nYes, but I have noticed it does better on some streams than others.  It is fairly consistent on a particular stream.  If will either cut off many or only one or two.  I guess that's not completely consistent, but it does work better on some than others and some have a lot of issues.\nIt also appears to have something to do with the segment.  It has recorded the same segment more than once and will cut off it off  all times.  Again ,this is not completely consistent, if it only cuts off a short amount, one time it may catch it all, but there are times it will do the same thing several times.\nI will try the latest version and see how it goes.\nThanks\n. I am not having much luck with the newest version.  Maybe it is the stream I am testing (http://www.ustream.tv/creativeLIVE-rebroadcast-2).  I was using the \"720p+_alt_akamai\" option since \"720p+\" gives me a bunch or errors and I find that at times, only lower quality, like mobile_240p were available at the time.  One time there were many other qualities available, not sure if 720p+ was.  My audio for most of these got out of sync on this stream and most were cut off.  As I watched it on Ustream, it would end a stream, then start it over near the end of what just ended, so it appears that stream is a bit peculiar.\n. I am confused how this works, or it is not working correctly for me.  I assume that --retry-streams will retry after the number of seconds in  has elapsed.  If I put in 5 for the delay, it will retry every 5 seconds.  I thought that if I used this with \"--retry-open\" together, it would retry the streams after the number of seconds in the \"--retry-streams\" for a total number of attempts as the value of \"--retry-open\".  It never exits though, it just sort of locks up and sits there, probably retrying ever 5 seconds.  If I use \"--retry-stream 5\" by itself and it can not find a stream, it gives the message about retrying for 5 seconds, but I assume will retry forever.  If I use \"--retry-open 3\", I suppose this works, it is just so fast it looks like it doesn't do anything except exit immediately.  I tried \"3000\" and there does appear to be a lag when it retires 3000 times.  I guess My questions is if these can be used together?\n. This will not occur after a \"[cli][info] Stream ended\" will it?  I just want to make sure I understand when this occurs.\n. This \"livestreamer http://www.twitch.tv/beyondthesummit best\" works for me.\n. No, just that it worked for me using the same command.  Not sure what could be wrong, the syntax it lists is what you are using and is correct.  I would make sure you have version 1.8 by using \"livestreamer -V\" and that it can find the plugins with \"livestreamer --plugins\".\n. How do you compile the \".py\" file.  I used \"python -m py_compile ustreamtv.py\" and it compiles to a \"pyc\" but it doesn't work correctly.\n. I was originally using 2.6, then installed 3.x, didn't work with either.  Just tried with 2.7 and does the same thing.  I am just trying to compile the ustreamtv.py to ustreamtv.pyc.\nOutput from livestreamer when using compiled ustreamtv.py plugin:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 6, in \n  File \"main.py\", line 128, in \n  File \"main__livestreamer.py\", line 9, in \n  File \"livestreamer_cli\\main.py\", line 886, in main\n  File \"livestreamer_cli\\main.py\", line 469, in handle_url\n  File \"livestreamer_cli\\main.py\", line 395, in fetch_streams_infinite\n  File \"livestreamer_cli\\main.py\", line 388, in fetch_streams\n  File \"livestreamer\\plugin\\plugin.py\", line 313, in get_streams\n  File \"livestreamer\\plugin\\plugin.py\", line 233, in streams\n  File \"ustreamtv.py\", line 550, in _get_live_streams\n  File \"ustreamtv.py\", line 513, in _get_desktop_streams\nKeyError: 'url'\n. I was assuming it needed to be complied since all the plugins in the plugins folder are complied.  But now that I look at it, the working one I have is not complied, go figure.  It is working for me but not perfect.  None of the ones posted here work for me.  Not sure where I got the one I am using, I keep backing them up in case a new version messes it up. Here is a working one.\nustreamtv.txt\n. This seems to work a little better but it is doing some strange things.  Basically, the one I had worked fine except that it, for the most part, cut off the end of the stream, consistently.  It also showed some errors but the stream did not skip, offset the audio, etc.  The one you have does not seem to cut the end off but is is dropping some information in between the middle at times and on one file the audio seemed off at the end. Funny thing is, I can save the same stream and one file will be larger than the other, I assumed the larger one contained more information, but it skips or drops out in places. Still testing.\n. My plugin seems to work fine most of the time except for the one thing you mention, it truncates the end of the stream.  I do get the audio out of sync on occasion, but the truncate issue is every time.  I have no idea how this works, but if you turn debug on you can see it downloads chunks.  I have wondered, as you have, if it is not writing that last chunk to the file.  Like maybe it sees the end of the stream before it writes the last part of the file.  Again, I have no idea how it works, just speculating.\nIt appears to add the chunk(s) to the queue, then write them.  You would think it would have to write to the file before it gets to the code to exit.\n. I tried to do some testing on this last night, very rudimentary.  I used livestreamer to capture a stream to a file, to VLC, and I viewed the stream online.  I know livestreamer cut the file stream short compared to when the ustream stream ended but I thought that it also ended the VLC stream short, which I would think does not involve writing to a file.  I will try and test this more tonight just to be sure, not sure if means anything or not.\n. I believe you just want to use the \"-o\" output option.  For example \"-o d:\\folder_name\\filename.flv\" \n. Works for me but says there are no streams found.\n. How do you use this script?  When I run it, I get this error.  I don't know know anything about python.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"fixit.py\", line 3, in \n    from livestreamer.packages import flashmedia\nImportError: No module named 'livestreamer'\nI have a file that I needed to end pre-maturely and wanted to see if this would fix it.\n. Yes, on Windows and I tried that.  Used the command \"c:\\Python33\\python fixit.py test.flv\".  I think I need an output file as well but I don't think that is not going to correct the error.\n. Yeah, that worked.  Strange thing though.  I recorded a stream but it did not end from one broadcast to another, normally it ends then starts another.  So I had to stop it manually which gave the incorrect duration (00:00).  Running the script works but appears to stop at the end of the first broadcast, the file is much smaller, and when I view it, the \"fixed\" file ends after the first broadcast.  Besides not getting the whole file, it is the second broadcast I would need since the first was started somewhere in  progress and the second was stopped after it ended, there may be a third or more in the file.  Not asking for a fix or saying anything is wrong, just noting what it is doing. \nAlso tried script on large file.  The duration of file was over 1:59:00 but it would only play about 10 minutes, to the end of the first broadcast.  File size was much smaller as well.\n. As a side note:  I used FLVExtact to extract the audio and video and then MP$Box to mux them back together and the resulting file, while perfectly viewable, is not the full length of the video in the file.  Seems to be an issue with the files.\n. This may ultimately be an issue for me with the veetle plugin or stream.  The stream never ends, meaning livestreamer will go on indefinitely.  This may be that the actual stream switches to another broadcast (movie or other video) but doesn't actually end, or livestreamer does not pick it up.  This seems consistent across all vettle streams.  However, the output file will be truncated when viewing to the end of the first broadcast or earlier.  The file will be of no duration, if fixed, the duration is much less than it should be.  I can never play the file past that point.  I used many programs to try and fix the file or get the full duration but all of them, including your script, truncate the file to the same length.  I was able to inject a duration with Flvtool2, converted that file to an mp4 to see what would happen, and the duration was over two hours but it will still only show the first 9 minutes.  When I run your script on the file, it only outputs the first 9 minutes, as do all other programs I've tried.  This particular file was a movie and I started livestreamer at the beginning of it, ended it just before it ended.  At 9:32 something happened to the flv file.  It is over 880,000KB in size.  Your script reduces it to almost 81,000KB, which makes sense because it is only 9:32 minutes long.  For some reason, it put an end to the file, or something at 9:32.  Normally it would do this at the end of the broadcast, but continue to output more, which I can never see.  Very peculiar.\n. I tried this with the build \"livestreamer-v1.7.5-65-g752eaaa-win32.zip\" and it appeared to work ok for awhile.  But after maybe 45 minutes, it gave me the following errors (same error several times):\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin ustreamtv for URL http://www.ustream.tv/creati\nveLIVE-rebroadcast\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 720p\nWritten 287375499 bytes[stream.uhs][error] Failed to open chunk 1395191177: Unab\nle to open URL: http://uhs-live-default.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs23/streams/httpflv/ust\nreamVideo/952665/streams/live_1_1395191177_1155237609.flv (404 Client Error: Not\n Found)\n[stream.uhs][error] Failed to open chunk 1395191177: Unable to open URL: http://\nuhs-live-default.ustream.tv/sjc-uhs23/streams/httpflv/ustreamVideo/952665/stream\ns/live_1_1395191177_1155237609.flv (404 Client Error: Not Found) \netc....this occurred around 12 times. \nThe URL it lists is not a valid URL, not sure where it got it from.\nI would then get the following error when I tried to play it with VLC:\nNo suitable decoder module:\nVLC does not support the audio or video format \"undf\". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.\nThe file will play audio, but no video.\nI need to do some more testing to see if this is a time dependent thing, I know it happened as soon as I started livestreamer one time, but not usually.  I was outputting to a file, not to VLC directly.  Funny thing is, I was using RTMPDump and RTMPSuck for awhile, but Usteam must have changed something recently since RMTPSuck won't work on it anymore but livestreamer does, to a point.  I can't find the command line string for RTMPDump.\nAlso, not sure if this is normal, but the \"Written\" size increases fast for a short time, then stops for some time.  It appears that when this stops, the file gets written to.  I believe this may cause the end of the output file to get truncated when the stream ends since it exits before the file is fully written.  I still need to test this more.  \nThanks\n.

I am not sure any of this is helping, but I ran three instances of livestreamer.  Was curious if they would throw an error at the same time. The second instance was started within seconds of the first.  The third was started 20-30 seconds after that.  Test1 & Test2 added the same chunks and wrote the stream at the same time (close to it), they basically outputted the same thing.  The third one also added the same chunks to queue but obviously the file written was different.  They all outputted adding the same chunks at the same time minus some lag between them.  I assumed the chunks would be different depending on when they were started, but I don't know anything about how this works, just an interesting observation.  I left them to run and the end of the output is below.  You can see how they all ended differently, I only posted the end of the output.  I assume this means that it is sort of random as to when it gets the \"Read timeout\" error\", they did not all error at the same time as I expected. All end with 10 \"Adding chunk to queue\" again.\nTest1 - Started first\nWritten 1458799740 bytes[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448207 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448208 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448209 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448210 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448211 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448212 to queue\n[cli][error] Error when reading from stream: Read timeout\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448213 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448214 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448215 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448216 to queue\nTest2 - Start a few seconds after Test1\nWritten 1063221731 bytes[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447921 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447922 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447923 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447924 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447925 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447926 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447927 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447928 to queue\n[cli][error] Error when reading from stream: Read timeout\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447929 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395447930 to queue\nTest 3 - Started 20-30 seconds after Test1\nWritten 2366752782 bytes[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448867 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448868 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448869 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448870 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448871 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448872 to queue\n[cli][error] Error when reading from stream: Read timeout\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448873 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448874 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448875 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1395448876 to queue\n.

This might be interesting.  I had two instances of livestreamer running at the same time, one with \"best\" and the other with  \"720+_alt_akami\".   Both gave errors for the same chunks and it tried to open them 3 times but failed, it did this for several chunks.  The errors for each were different though, maybe this is expected.  The \"best\" option seems to work well for some time.  It can go hours with just an error now and then for failing to open a chunk once, but it gets it the next try.  Then all of the sudden it does what is shown below.\n\"720+_alt_akami\"\n[stream.uhs][error] Failed to open chunk 1395511570: Unable to open URL:

1395511575 complete\n. Is there a way for me to implement the requests latest build into livestreamer to test this.  I know nothing about Python but I tried it by downloaded the latest requests which appeared to have the \"timeout\" feature implemented in \"adapters.py\".  I compiled the files in the requests folder and copied them to the livestreamer requests folder.  I didn't notice anything different.  Or does this need to be implemented somehow in livestreamer in a later release?\nUsing the 720p+ stream gives me a a lot of lost chunks.  Using 720p+_alt_akamai works better, but it seems to always cut off the last 10 seconds or so of the stream if I save to a file.  It also seems to loose the first few seconds (not sure how many, maybe 10) of the beginning.  I restart livestreamer (in a loop) when the stream ends and use --retry-streams 1 until it picks it up again.  This works pretty well, but sometimes, not always, it looses the end and/or beginning.  I have also tried it without --retry-streams and just had it wait for 10 seconds before restarting.  I have changed this time but it sometimes still misses the beginning.  It is possible it is the stream.  When using 720p+_alt_akamai, sometimes it will find a mobile stream but not the 720p stream for several tries.\nI should try the above while viewing a second instance with VLC and see if that gets cut off as well.\n. I assumed that since you mentioned what is below, that the timeout issue would be solved.  maybe it was a different time out issue.\n\nIt looks like the thread that is responsible for fetching the segments gets stuck. Most likely what happens is that the HTTP request never times out, which is probably caused by a bug currently existing in the HTTP library we use (requests) where the timeout is not applied to streaming responses (it will be fixed in the next version though).\n\nI was referring to this: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1803, but it could be unrelated.  It was just a timeout issue they were dealing with so I assumed it was the one you mentioned.\n. Just curious, is the change to use non-streaming the best way to do it?  Will it be reverted back the way it was before at some point in the future or remain this way?\n. Let me know if this is something that might be an issue in how things are handled in the plugin, or occurs for some other reason.  I open livestreamer and have the ustream stream playing in VLC.  I also have the same stream open in a browser window on Ustream.tv.  The livestreamer stream in VLC is about 10 seconds behind the browser stream, which is not really an issue, that I know of.  However, the browser stream will end and then the VLC stream will, a few seconds later, which means the livestreamer stream does not play to the end of the actual stream.  This happens the same in an output file, it cuts off the end.\nDoes the stream end because it in fact ended and it stops livestreamer immediately, but since it is about 10 seconds behind, it cuts it off?  Did the stream end and it didn't have the time to write or show the rest of the stream?  I am assuming from what you said here:\n\nI've pushed a workaround that will attempt to downlaod the whole segment in one go which should make the timeout work correctly. Downside with this approach is that we have to wait for each segment to be fully downloaded before it can be sent to the player.\n\n...that maybe, and this is pure speculation, that it might be trying to download the next segment, the stream ends, then it stops.  If outputting to a file, it gets truncated.  If in a  player, it ends before finishing.  Just curious. \n. This appears to work better now.  It appears to be capturing to the end of the stream.\nThanks\n. I am getting some peculiar results with this now.  Some things seem to be worked out.  But for the most part, the issues come at the start or end of a stream.  I am using the --retry-streams option and at times it won't capture the beginning of cuts off the end.  I am going to assume that this is either an issue with the stream, as sometimes it works perfectly, or possibly the implementation per this:\n\nAbout your issues, it is likely my implementation is slightly wrong since it's based purely on analyzing the network traffic. I have to decompile the flash player to get a better look how this works, but haven't gotten around to it yet.\n\nThe other issue that is more peculiar, is that it, at times, will not sync the audio and video.  I was trying to do some testing on this but think it only occurs when outputed to a file, not to VLC.  At some point in the video, the video jumps and it appears the audio does as well, and then they are out of sync after that.  This does not happen all the time and I don't get an error.  I tried it with the debug option and I don't see it doing anything peculiar, maybe it is \"fetching module info\" more in a row than it normally does, but not sure.  The stream it was doing it on is not online anymore so I can't test it on the stream it was occurring on.\nAnything I can keep a look out for or test to narrow this down?\n. > I did some testing by sending a stream myself to ustream and it seems there is a delay from where I start the stream on my end and when ustream will let me access it, it's usually between 15 and 30 seconds, is that what you're seeing?\nYes, but I have noticed it does better on some streams than others.  It is fairly consistent on a particular stream.  If will either cut off many or only one or two.  I guess that's not completely consistent, but it does work better on some than others and some have a lot of issues.\nIt also appears to have something to do with the segment.  It has recorded the same segment more than once and will cut off it off  all times.  Again ,this is not completely consistent, if it only cuts off a short amount, one time it may catch it all, but there are times it will do the same thing several times.\nI will try the latest version and see how it goes.\nThanks\n. I am not having much luck with the newest version.  Maybe it is the stream I am testing (http://www.ustream.tv/creativeLIVE-rebroadcast-2).  I was using the \"720p+_alt_akamai\" option since \"720p+\" gives me a bunch or errors and I find that at times, only lower quality, like mobile_240p were available at the time.  One time there were many other qualities available, not sure if 720p+ was.  My audio for most of these got out of sync on this stream and most were cut off.  As I watched it on Ustream, it would end a stream, then start it over near the end of what just ended, so it appears that stream is a bit peculiar.\n. I am confused how this works, or it is not working correctly for me.  I assume that --retry-streams will retry after the number of seconds in  has elapsed.  If I put in 5 for the delay, it will retry every 5 seconds.  I thought that if I used this with \"--retry-open\" together, it would retry the streams after the number of seconds in the \"--retry-streams\" for a total number of attempts as the value of \"--retry-open\".  It never exits though, it just sort of locks up and sits there, probably retrying ever 5 seconds.  If I use \"--retry-stream 5\" by itself and it can not find a stream, it gives the message about retrying for 5 seconds, but I assume will retry forever.  If I use \"--retry-open 3\", I suppose this works, it is just so fast it looks like it doesn't do anything except exit immediately.  I tried \"3000\" and there does appear to be a lag when it retires 3000 times.  I guess My questions is if these can be used together?\n. This will not occur after a \"[cli][info] Stream ended\" will it?  I just want to make sure I understand when this occurs.\n. This \"livestreamer http://www.twitch.tv/beyondthesummit best\" works for me.\n. No, just that it worked for me using the same command.  Not sure what could be wrong, the syntax it lists is what you are using and is correct.  I would make sure you have version 1.8 by using \"livestreamer -V\" and that it can find the plugins with \"livestreamer --plugins\".\n. How do you compile the \".py\" file.  I used \"python -m py_compile ustreamtv.py\" and it compiles to a \"pyc\" but it doesn't work correctly.\n. I was originally using 2.6, then installed 3.x, didn't work with either.  Just tried with 2.7 and does the same thing.  I am just trying to compile the ustreamtv.py to ustreamtv.pyc.\nOutput from livestreamer when using compiled ustreamtv.py plugin:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 6, in \n  File \"main.py\", line 128, in \n  File \"main__livestreamer.py\", line 9, in \n  File \"livestreamer_cli\\main.py\", line 886, in main\n  File \"livestreamer_cli\\main.py\", line 469, in handle_url\n  File \"livestreamer_cli\\main.py\", line 395, in fetch_streams_infinite\n  File \"livestreamer_cli\\main.py\", line 388, in fetch_streams\n  File \"livestreamer\\plugin\\plugin.py\", line 313, in get_streams\n  File \"livestreamer\\plugin\\plugin.py\", line 233, in streams\n  File \"ustreamtv.py\", line 550, in _get_live_streams\n  File \"ustreamtv.py\", line 513, in _get_desktop_streams\nKeyError: 'url'\n. I was assuming it needed to be complied since all the plugins in the plugins folder are complied.  But now that I look at it, the working one I have is not complied, go figure.  It is working for me but not perfect.  None of the ones posted here work for me.  Not sure where I got the one I am using, I keep backing them up in case a new version messes it up. Here is a working one.\nustreamtv.txt\n. This seems to work a little better but it is doing some strange things.  Basically, the one I had worked fine except that it, for the most part, cut off the end of the stream, consistently.  It also showed some errors but the stream did not skip, offset the audio, etc.  The one you have does not seem to cut the end off but is is dropping some information in between the middle at times and on one file the audio seemed off at the end. Funny thing is, I can save the same stream and one file will be larger than the other, I assumed the larger one contained more information, but it skips or drops out in places. Still testing.\n. My plugin seems to work fine most of the time except for the one thing you mention, it truncates the end of the stream.  I do get the audio out of sync on occasion, but the truncate issue is every time.  I have no idea how this works, but if you turn debug on you can see it downloads chunks.  I have wondered, as you have, if it is not writing that last chunk to the file.  Like maybe it sees the end of the stream before it writes the last part of the file.  Again, I have no idea how it works, just speculating.\nIt appears to add the chunk(s) to the queue, then write them.  You would think it would have to write to the file before it gets to the code to exit.\n. I tried to do some testing on this last night, very rudimentary.  I used livestreamer to capture a stream to a file, to VLC, and I viewed the stream online.  I know livestreamer cut the file stream short compared to when the ustream stream ended but I thought that it also ended the VLC stream short, which I would think does not involve writing to a file.  I will try and test this more tonight just to be sure, not sure if means anything or not.\n. I believe you just want to use the \"-o\" output option.  For example \"-o d:\\folder_name\\filename.flv\" \n. Works for me but says there are no streams found.\n. ",

When a streamlive.io stream is playing, in firefox hit F12, then goto network tab, type .m3u8 in the filter box, this will show the source url of stream. right click to copy URL\nthe source url can be played by simply > vlc 'http://sourceurlinquotes.m3u8' \n: Note this method does not use any livestreamer/streamlink plugins.\ni strongly suggest you ditch livestreamer in favour of the new improved streamlink. livestreamer is now unsupported, FAIK the lead developer been AWOL for months,  switch to the new improved fork  streamlink  streamlink will also download you tube videos, i wrote a wrapper script, if you on linux or osx and u want to try it just holla, also apps like mps-youtube will download live yt streams, playlilsts, video, convert to .mp3 etc mps-youtube meh above potplayer looks proprietary, check out the new improved open source fork  of mplayer, named mpv  Another top pick of open source software is youtube-dl it will take care of all your you tube needs. Even Stallman approves of it.. Use streamlink ( fork of livestreamer) livestreamer is now unmaintaned.. https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink. ",

I can give you some pointers about how the plugin works if you decide to go down that route and you need some guidance d:\nThe good news is that there's people that already got around using the other API (look at Horriblesubs for example), so I'm pretty sure you can find some other scripts/tool that can help you with that.

The \"unable to connect to RTMP server\" problem seems to have resolved itself, but I can no longer get it to record more than a few seconds worth of video, before it exits, saying the stream went offline.\n. I don't know if the author of livestreamer used decompiled code, or just analyzed the network stream with Wireshark and the like.  But if he reverse engineered it from analyzing the stream, having a peek at the decompiled flash player should help improve livestreamer.\nI myself am also a software developer, and while I don't know ActionScript, I do have some experience with network streaming video, so I wouldn't mind having a peek at the decompiled code.  I might give that a try later tonight.\n. viewer:303.swf contains mostly UI code.  The actual logic for the video streaming is in viewer.rsl.swf, which you can download from http://www.ustream.tv/flash/viewer.rsl.swf\n. ",

How do you run it?\n. Make sure you don't have the old version still installed.\n. Sounds like a VLC issue, not a Livestreamer one.\n. What about MPC-HC?

I downloaded and installed Python 3.4.0 and tried the command \"python install_native.py\" in the path that the file is located but Windows doesn't recognize the Python command, I do notice that the install_native.py file now has an icon, could I perhaps just double-click it?\nOkay I'll be honest I double-clicked it just to test and it flashed a console window, is that it for that part or does it mean that didn't work?\nEdit: I don't think double-clicking it works. http://i.imgur.com/TfkZ8oP.png It seems to me that it's trying to install the linux version instead of the Windows version, but I don't really know.\nEdit 2: Perhaps it's possible to do it manually? Whatever it is.. =S\n. Hmm honestly it's not that much of a problem for me anymore, I made a little program that has my favorite streamers as shortcuts, so I just type a number from 1 to 11 and then enter and it takes me to the stream that number is assigned to, I can just type a streamers name and it will take me to that stream, it's ugly code though and everything is hard-coded. =/ Still it works for my usage \n. I see, I did try a VPN and that didn't help.\nBefore Twitch implemented HLS a lot of European viewers including me had a lot of stuttering, but after they switched to HLS it has been working mostly fine.\nMy Firewall doesn't mention anything being blocked, but I'll try disabling that and my HIPS and see if that helps.\nSo weird that it has been working fine for so long and then now it suddenly went to sheit and stops for like 10-20 seconds every x minutes. =/\nEdit: Disabling Firewall and HIPS didn't solve anything. =/\nEdit 2: Seems to be happening with the normal twitch player too... Well Fu-\n. ",

I'm going to try it again now, then with my own channel, and see if the issue is resolved.\n. I wasn't clear, I did the network traffic capture for both viewing the stream on twitch in my browser and viewing it via Livestreamer and Twitch, getting one file for each.\n. It worked fine again when i watched this stream through Twitch, gonna attempt the operation on PS4 and my own channel now.\n. When I tried to play my stream through VLC and Livestreamer this time everything seeemed to work ok looking at the Command Prompt, but VLC was only showing a loop, a few seconds of looping video with a long beep in the background, before the screen went grey and the loop began again. I can't tell if this was an issue with the stream or with Twitch and the stream because the WiFi on my laptop was too poor in the room I'm in to view the stream on Twitch before I began Livestreamer (the PS4 that's doing the streaming is connected via LAN and should have no such problems). \n. The close and reopen was a misclick.\n. I'm not sure if the diagnosis of WiFi issues stands if it works perfectly on any channel except mine. I'll give it another go.\n. I'm becoming more convinced that this is a WiFi issue as everything seemed to work OK initially but was laggy before the error occurred as of my first comment. However, it's impractical for me to move my laptop nearer my router because that means moving it away from the PS4.

I made an attempt to capture the network traffic, and got two files, but I don't know how to upload them or whether I've done it right. When I tried to run another channel through Livestreamer and VLC  for the purposes of this, I found it worked perfectly. I'm going to try it again now, then with my own channel, and see if the issue is resolved.\n. I wasn't clear, I did the network traffic capture for both viewing the stream on twitch in my browser and viewing it via Livestreamer and Twitch, getting one file for each.\n. It worked fine again when i watched this stream through Twitch, gonna attempt the operation on PS4 and my own channel now.\n. When I tried to play my stream through VLC and Livestreamer this time everything seeemed to work ok looking at the Command Prompt, but VLC was only showing a loop, a few seconds of looping video with a long beep in the background, before the screen went grey and the loop began again. I can't tell if this was an issue with the stream or with Twitch and the stream because the WiFi on my laptop was too poor in the room I'm in to view the stream on Twitch before I began Livestreamer (the PS4 that's doing the streaming is connected via LAN and should have no such problems). \n. The close and reopen was a misclick.\n. I'm not sure if the diagnosis of WiFi issues stands if it works perfectly on any channel except mine. I'll give it another go.\n. I'm becoming more convinced that this is a WiFi issue as everything seemed to work OK initially but was laggy before the error occurred as of my first comment. However, it's impractical for me to move my laptop nearer my router because that means moving it away from the PS4.  Anyway, unless you can suggest anything that's not your problem, so thank you for your help to this point and close this issue if you wish. :)\n. ",

My region is Germany, so not all of them are available to me for Simulcast, only Non Non Biyori and that one works fine, except for the latest episode, because you can't access episodes of Simulcast series which require a Premium account (for your region) and you are not passing over your login data.\n\"Simulcast\" episodes on CR are only for premium users, guests and normal users have to wait to get access to them.\n. So maybe CR has changed something in their iOS API that affects simulcasts.\n. Splitting a live livestream is not possible with just livestreamer. You will need at least another cli tool that will split your captured data and even then this can't be fast enough to process such short files in realtime.\nThere are some shell script examples where you can split a single file into multiple files with fixed lengths each other, but they require that you know how long the original file is (which is unknown on a live broadcast stream).\n. First, make sure that Banshee can handle the most common stream protocols, which are HTTP, HTTPS, HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), MMS (streamed by Windows Media server), RTMP and RTSP.\nAs listed on Wikipedia, Banshee seems to only support HTTP, RTSP and a Podcast protocol. So you can't connect to YouTube for example, as they use either HTTPS, HLS or RTSP (RTSP for mobile users 144p).\nThat's why VLC is the default player for livestreamer, as it can handle almost all common and uncommon streaming protocols.\nSo this question/request is better asked to the Banshee developers and not livestreamer, because they have to implement additional streaming protocols.\n. Redownload livestreamer. As you are on Windows, get the one from the Releases tab. Try it with the zipped, if the setup exe fails. Then try again with your command.\nIt gives me the correct output:\nlivestreamer twitch.tv/riotgames2 worst\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin twitch for URL twitch.tv/riotgames2\n[cli][info] Available streams: audio, high, low, medium, mobile (worst), source\n(best)\n[cli][info] Opening stream: mobile (hls)\n. Why remuxing as FLV Container? MP4 Container is the better choice and does not need a special stream splitter for WMP and is widely supported on consumer electronics like TVs, Receivers and DVD/BD players.\nNote on first example (Download only, with FFmpeg):\nIt is always better to set the global_header flag instead of removing it:\nset transcode=\"%ffmpeg% -re -i - -c:v copy -c:a copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -flags +global_header %chan%-%ldt%.mp4\"\nThis circumvents errors/warnings of newer FFmpeg releases when doing stream copy, as FFmpeg will always make sure that the headers for MP4 containers are correct and will fix them if needed, especially when remuxing from a MPEG-TS (Twitch's and CR's default output container format).\n. livestreamer --hls-segment-attempts=25 --hls-segment-timeout=60.0\nTry up to 25 times to retrieve a single HLS segment and wait up to 60 seconds for each retrieval. Resets if requested segment is available during that timeout. The stream stops, if the requested segment could not be read during that time and attempts reached max (in this special case after 25 minutes in total for a single segment).\n. > Confirmation requested: if Livestreamer stdout says a segment failed but continues downloading, the segment was successfully downloaded on another attempt?\nIf the stream continues smoothly in playback, then the segment was downloaded successfully on another attempt. You can check it, if you set the log level to info (I guess).\n. Which broadcasting provider is this stream assigned to? As it returns some sort of HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden error, it seems that it requires a special useragent or special headers.\n. There seems to be a problem on Windows 10 when livestreamer was not installed using pip but extracted from the zip or using setup.\nCheck your firewall and router config and try to install livestreamer using pip (Python package manager). See last comment on #544\n. Youtube Playlists are currently not supported by livestreamer.\n. utm_medium and utm_campaign are parameters which are required for Google's Analytics program.\nLooks like they are not filtered by the plugin and let the command interpreter throw errors.\n. But the Youtube URLs also use the question mark and there are no problems with them on cmd/shell.\nOr has it to do with how many params are parsed by the plugin? Because these both are usually the last ones in URLs and are usually optional.\n. By default no, but you can pass --log-level debug to the command and redirect stdout to a file using the > like > livestreamer.log\n$ livestreamer --log-level debug yourstream.url quality > livestreamer.log\n. As you see livestreamer itself identifies as the iOS App for CR, but the API and this App are not designed to watch CR streams on 720p and 1080p, even if you have Premium Membership. So CR does not serve the HD streams to iOS. This is why we are stuck to up to 480p on CR.\nYou can only watch them in 720p/1080p on the PC/Laptop or apps on platforms which support the HD resolutions.\n. To be honest, the credentials for CR Premium are only needed for livestreamer if you want to watch recent published episodes (which require Premium access, otherwise you have to wait 1 week) or series which require to be Premium for your Region, mostly series for which CR does not have the full broadcasting license for.\nI for myself could watch additional series in my region if I had Premium, but I don't like CR that much, so I'm staying for the free content. That's why I can't watch Fairy Tail for example in my region, which would be possible with Premium access.\nAnd because this \"issue\" is on CR's side, I think this can be closed.\n. Tried it and works without problems.\nA 500 Server Error is mostly temporary and on the server side due to script errors or a process not running.\nThe stream takes a while to load and it might buffer, but it works.\n. As from what I found, the usual YT API supports Youtube Gaming, but requires you to use videoCategoryId=20 as param.\nhttps://twitter.com/Steam_Spy/status/642339647918620672\nI won't test it, because since v2 is abandoned, I'm no longer using the API.\n. livestreamer is no longer being developed and you should move over to streamlink, which is a fork of livestreamer and under active development.\nhttps://github.com/streamlink/streamlink. Are you behind a proxy?\nBecause all plugins report the same problem, there seems to be an issue with your internet connection.\n. Don't think you can actually do this, at least not with livestreamer which uses the iOS API (which is anyway limited to max. 480p, regardless of premium or not, so you really want to softsub a 480p video with japanese subs?).\nYou can try it with --crunchyroll-locale=ja_JP to get a video without subs, but don't think that it actually works.\n. Just an old issue(?) when CR only supported up to 480p on most devices except browser, regardless of premium access or not. Seems like CR enabled HD content on all other devices, so its no longer restricted.\n. Have you added the 292312f and 898f73a changes?\n. There is no need to edit binaries (but you need the source code version if you want modify it yourself). Just download the http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/livestreamer-latest-win32.zip which includes sources for all files and also the compiled files and replace your livestreamer installation with it.\nThis build already includes the changes, so you don't have to do them yourself.\nIf you edit the .py files, they will automatically compiled into .pyc by the minimal Python interpreter included with livestreamer.\n. Its always better to check the manual on http://docs.livestreamer.io/cli.html#stream-options :\nPass --retry-streams <numberofseconds> with a high value to wait between retry attempts and --retry-open <numberofattempts> (default: 1 attempt) to set a higher number of retry attempts.\n. Well, ... why you need it to run as root? As the message says, there's actually no need to, and if you really need to, there's the option for.\nWhere was it installed to and which Linux system you're using?\n. This has nothing to do with livestreamer itself. It needs to be done on the user's side on the operating system level. There are some informations on MSDN on how to implement this in your own applications on Windows. If you're more confident with the Windows Registry, you can add a protocol handler on your own.\nDepending on the browser you can also add custom protocols on the application level, means they will only work inside that browser. For example, a fictional livestreamer://twitch.tv/channelname/source can open the Twitch channel of channelname with source quality.\n. On livestreamer's command line, add:\n--player \"/path/to/mplayer -cache <cachevalue>\" (in KB)\n--player \"/path/to/mplayer2 -cache <cachevalue>\" (in KB)\n--player \"/path/to/mpv --cache <cachevalue>\" (in KB)\n--player \"/path/to/vlc --file-caching <cache-ms> --network-caching <cache-ms>\" (values in miliseconds)\n. Yes, you need them or single quotes ' , as this is needed to be treated as one single param for livestreamer. Without them, livestreamer would use them for itself.\nWhere'd you see the # ?\nA complete command line can be as following:\nlivestreamer whatyouwanttoplay --player \"vlc --file-caching=5000 --network-caching=2000\"\n. I'm unsure about the =-signs for vlc's params, but yeah, this should work.\nIf vlc doesn't recognize the = then just replace them with a space (like you already did):\n--player \"/path/to/vlc --file-caching 10000 --network-caching 10000\"\n. I've also ran into this problem, but with all streams on CR. Its definitely the check on the key 'quality' for being text content (and it is text content, according to the API response, except for 240p, where it is actually None), but I have no idea how to solve this.\ncrunchyroll.py on line 61 is this:\n\"quality\": validate.text,\nAlso it seems that CR switched to hlsvariant://\n. > Maybe we can always use \"adaptive\" HLS variant playlist (something like in #1494).\nI've tested this, however it outputs interesting quality levels.\nFor some I get \"Available streams: 1080p (best), 240p (worst), 360p, 480p, 720p\" and for others \"Available streams: 120k (worst), 328k, 864k (best)\". 864k translates to 480p, 328k to 360p and 120k to 240p.\n. So then you could implement two new parameters to the cli to set the locale and user agent language and use enUS for the API_LOCALE and en_US for the user agent language by default.\nThese would be Crunchyroll specific.\nOr both are read from the system it is running on.\nExample: livestreamer --crunchyroll-locale=deDE --crunchyroll-uagent-locale=de_DE http://www.crunchyroll.com/some/series/link qualitysetting\nThis was not tested on my side, but it should not be a problem to implement them and rewrite the code of crunchyroll.py to accept the new params (I'm not that confident with Python).\n.

So maybe CR has changed something in their iOS API that affects simulcasts.\n. Splitting a live livestream is not possible with just livestreamer. You will need at least another cli tool that will split your captured data and even then this can't be fast enough to process such short files in realtime.\nThere are some shell script examples where you can split a single file into multiple files with fixed lengths each other, but they require that you know how long the original file is (which is unknown on a live broadcast stream).\n. First, make sure that Banshee can handle the most common stream protocols, which are HTTP, HTTPS, HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), MMS (streamed by Windows Media server), RTMP and RTSP.\nAs listed on Wikipedia, Banshee seems to only support HTTP, RTSP and a Podcast protocol. So you can't connect to YouTube for example, as they use either HTTPS, HLS or RTSP (RTSP for mobile users 144p).\nThat's why VLC is the default player for livestreamer, as it can handle almost all common and uncommon streaming protocols.\nSo this question/request is better asked to the Banshee developers and not livestreamer, because they have to implement additional streaming protocols.\n. Redownload livestreamer. As you are on Windows, get the one from the Releases tab. Try it with the zipped, if the setup exe fails. Then try again with your command.\nIt gives me the correct output:\nlivestreamer twitch.tv/riotgames2 worst\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin twitch for URL twitch.tv/riotgames2\n[cli][info] Available streams: audio, high, low, medium, mobile (worst), source\n(best)\n[cli][info] Opening stream: mobile (hls)\n. Why remuxing as FLV Container? MP4 Container is the better choice and does not need a special stream splitter for WMP and is widely supported on consumer electronics like TVs, Receivers and DVD/BD players.\nNote on first example (Download only, with FFmpeg):\nIt is always better to set the global_header flag instead of removing it:\nset transcode=\"%ffmpeg% -re -i - -c:v copy -c:a copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -flags +global_header %chan%-%ldt%.mp4\"\nThis circumvents errors/warnings of newer FFmpeg releases when doing stream copy, as FFmpeg will always make sure that the headers for MP4 containers are correct and will fix them if needed, especially when remuxing from a MPEG-TS (Twitch's and CR's default output container format).\n. livestreamer --hls-segment-attempts=25 --hls-segment-timeout=60.0\nTry up to 25 times to retrieve a single HLS segment and wait up to 60 seconds for each retrieval. Resets if requested segment is available during that timeout. The stream stops, if the requested segment could not be read during that time and attempts reached max (in this special case after 25 minutes in total for a single segment).\n. > Confirmation requested: if Livestreamer stdout says a segment failed but continues downloading, the segment was successfully downloaded on another attempt?\nIf the stream continues smoothly in playback, then the segment was downloaded successfully on another attempt. You can check it, if you set the log level to info (I guess).\n. Which broadcasting provider is this stream assigned to? As it returns some sort of HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden error, it seems that it requires a special useragent or special headers.\n. There seems to be a problem on Windows 10 when livestreamer was not installed using pip but extracted from the zip or using setup.\nCheck your firewall and router config and try to install livestreamer using pip (Python package manager). See last comment on #544\n. Youtube Playlists are currently not supported by livestreamer.\n. utm_medium and utm_campaign are parameters which are required for Google's Analytics program.\nLooks like they are not filtered by the plugin and let the command interpreter throw errors.\n. But the Youtube URLs also use the question mark and there are no problems with them on cmd/shell.\nOr has it to do with how many params are parsed by the plugin? Because these both are usually the last ones in URLs and are usually optional.\n. By default no, but you can pass --log-level debug to the command and redirect stdout to a file using the > like > livestreamer.log\n$ livestreamer --log-level debug yourstream.url quality > livestreamer.log\n. As you see livestreamer itself identifies as the iOS App for CR, but the API and this App are not designed to watch CR streams on 720p and 1080p, even if you have Premium Membership. So CR does not serve the HD streams to iOS. This is why we are stuck to up to 480p on CR.\nYou can only watch them in 720p/1080p on the PC/Laptop or apps on platforms which support the HD resolutions.\n. To be honest, the credentials for CR Premium are only needed for livestreamer if you want to watch recent published episodes (which require Premium access, otherwise you have to wait 1 week) or series which require to be Premium for your Region, mostly series for which CR does not have the full broadcasting license for.\nI for myself could watch additional series in my region if I had Premium, but I don't like CR that much, so I'm staying for the free content. That's why I can't watch Fairy Tail for example in my region, which would be possible with Premium access.\nAnd because this \"issue\" is on CR's side, I think this can be closed.\n. Tried it and works without problems.\nA 500 Server Error is mostly temporary and on the server side due to script errors or a process not running.\nThe stream takes a while to load and it might buffer, but it works.\n. As from what I found, the usual YT API supports Youtube Gaming, but requires you to use videoCategoryId=20 as param.\nhttps://twitter.com/Steam_Spy/status/642339647918620672\nI won't test it, because since v2 is abandoned, I'm no longer using the API.\n. livestreamer is no longer being developed and you should move over to streamlink, which is a fork of livestreamer and under active development.\nhttps://github.com/streamlink/streamlink. Are you behind a proxy?\nBecause all plugins report the same problem, there seems to be an issue with your internet connection.\n. Don't think you can actually do this, at least not with livestreamer which uses the iOS API (which is anyway limited to max. 480p, regardless of premium or not, so you really want to softsub a 480p video with japanese subs?).\nYou can try it with --crunchyroll-locale=ja_JP to get a video without subs, but don't think that it actually works.\n. Just an old issue(?) when CR only supported up to 480p on most devices except browser, regardless of premium access or not. Seems like CR enabled HD content on all other devices, so its no longer restricted.\n. Have you added the 292312f and 898f73a changes?\n. There is no need to edit binaries (but you need the source code version if you want modify it yourself). Just download the http://livestreamer-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/livestreamer-latest-win32.zip which includes sources for all files and also the compiled files and replace your livestreamer installation with it.\nThis build already includes the changes, so you don't have to do them yourself.\nIf you edit the .py files, they will automatically compiled into .pyc by the minimal Python interpreter included with livestreamer.\n. Its always better to check the manual on http://docs.livestreamer.io/cli.html#stream-options :\nPass --retry-streams <numberofseconds> with a high value to wait between retry attempts and --retry-open <numberofattempts> (default: 1 attempt) to set a higher number of retry attempts.\n. Well, ... why you need it to run as root? As the message says, there's actually no need to, and if you really need to, there's the option for.\nWhere was it installed to and which Linux system you're using?\n. This has nothing to do with livestreamer itself. It needs to be done on the user's side on the operating system level. There are some informations on MSDN on how to implement this in your own applications on Windows. If you're more confident with the Windows Registry, you can add a protocol handler on your own.\nDepending on the browser you can also add custom protocols on the application level, means they will only work inside that browser. For example, a fictional livestreamer://twitch.tv/channelname/source can open the Twitch channel of channelname with source quality.\n. On livestreamer's command line, add:\n--player \"/path/to/mplayer -cache <cachevalue>\" (in KB)\n--player \"/path/to/mplayer2 -cache <cachevalue>\" (in KB)\n--player \"/path/to/mpv --cache <cachevalue>\" (in KB)\n--player \"/path/to/vlc --file-caching <cache-ms> --network-caching <cache-ms>\" (values in miliseconds)\n. Yes, you need them or single quotes ' , as this is needed to be treated as one single param for livestreamer. Without them, livestreamer would use them for itself.\nWhere'd you see the # ?\nA complete command line can be as following:\nlivestreamer whatyouwanttoplay --player \"vlc --file-caching=5000 --network-caching=2000\"\n. I'm unsure about the =-signs for vlc's params, but yeah, this should work.\nIf vlc doesn't recognize the = then just replace them with a space (like you already did):\n--player \"/path/to/vlc --file-caching 10000 --network-caching 10000\"\n. I've also ran into this problem, but with all streams on CR. Its definitely the check on the key 'quality' for being text content (and it is text content, according to the API response, except for 240p, where it is actually None), but I have no idea how to solve this.\ncrunchyroll.py on line 61 is this:\n\"quality\": validate.text,\nAlso it seems that CR switched to hlsvariant://\n. > Maybe we can always use \"adaptive\" HLS variant playlist (something like in #1494).\nI've tested this, however it outputs interesting quality levels.\nFor some I get \"Available streams: 1080p (best), 240p (worst), 360p, 480p, 720p\" and for others \"Available streams: 120k (worst), 328k, 864k (best)\". 864k translates to 480p, 328k to 360p and 120k to 240p.\n.

On my Mac - using Safari set up with user agent \"IOS 7 - iPad\" - after a video has started, I can right-click and select \"Copy video address\" (I use a Danish version, so I don't know the exact translation for that option). \nExample URL: http://www.dr.dk/tv/se/copenhagen-jazz-festival/copenhagen-jazz-festival\nVideo address: http://drod04a-vh.akamaihd.net/i/all/clear/streaming/85/53bdc10fa11f9d135cde6c85/Copenhagen-Jazz-Festival_985df41af2d64c31af2292c226919065_,157,1424,561,247,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8\n. Yes, It may somehow be the same stream.\nHowever, when using Safari with the default user agent it requires Flash and when using Safari with the IOS user agent it plays without flash (mp4 ?).\nAnyway,\nffmpeg -i input.ts -c copy output.mp4\nproduces the error:\n\nMalformed AAC bitstream detected: use audio bitstream filter 'aac_adtstoasc' to fix it ('-bsf:a aac_adtstoasc' option with ffmpeg)\n\nSo this works:\nffmpeg -i input.ts -c copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc output.mp4\n.

    "villavic": "Hey, thanks for having considered it, sorry I couldn't get back to you last week. I agree that the RingBuffer wasn't the best approach but I didn't want to deviate much from the current code. The core part of my mod was that deque.insert() method that kept the segments sorted. \nWhile testing, however if I kept the RingBuffer \"unavailable\" for too long it (ie: waiting for more than 3 segments) returned 2_N (4096 - 8192) bytes of junk at random, which was weird and I couldn't figure out where those came from.\nI only tested with twitch.tv (wanted to watch multiple TI4 streams :+) thinking it would be just a quick hack. Let me know if you'd like me testing your approach, not only I have this horrible ISP that caps http streams but I also have another two ISPs set up in a round-robin load-balancing fashion (FreeBSD/pf) with my changes on livestreamer and 6 threads I get 2 http streams on each of my ISPs and the total download speeds goes up from 250KB/s (the usual cap) to 1.6MB/s (the combined speed of my slow_ ISPs).\n. Tested. Works well with my bw caps for anything <=720p and futures do quite simplify the sorting I had to hack up, but when the segments become bigger, the wait for the threads to finish before giving back data causes \"stream timeouts\" (not segments).\nIt's just a nitpick.\nMy implementation gives back data as soon as 3 segments have completed (regardless of the number of threads, I run with 6, 2 per ISP), it fails when the 3 segments aren't the \"first\" 3 segments (which is, I believe, one of the errors you spotted) so the stream doesn't timeout (that often) with higher bandwidth streams, only segments do (and get retried, and things blow up when a \"very old\" segment gets added to the buffer, I missed some logic to discard them when newer segments were already delivered).\nAnother detail, the player I use is mpv and I set it up with a commandline with a cache of 8Mb, it starts playing after filling 90% of the cache, then pauses at 20% cache and doesn't resume until 50%, that setup gives the parallel-download time to catch up when there are segment-retries/timeouts but also causes the startup to wait quite a long time, at least a whole playlist is usually already downloaded before video starts, waiting on all 6 segments (threads) of the first HLS playlist pretty much doubles that wait time.\nHowever, never mind me, it's just food for thought.

I agree that the RingBuffer wasn't the best approach but I didn't want to deviate much from the current code. The core part of my mod was that deque.insert() method that kept the segments sorted. \nWhile testing, however if I kept the RingBuffer \"unavailable\" for too long it (ie: waiting for more than 3 segments) returned 2_N (4096 - 8192) bytes of junk at random, which was weird and I couldn't figure out where those came from.\nI only tested with twitch.tv (wanted to watch multiple TI4 streams :+) thinking it would be just a quick hack.

That is supported perfectly in Livestreamer at 1080p.    So - it's definitely an ongoing issue just with Ustream UHS streams.    \nThanks!\n. You are testing on Windows - My issue is on the Raspberry Pi.  Can you think of some dependency on the Pi that would possibly be causing the issue?\n. The base image of the ISS-Above has remained unchanged from when it was working reliably until  a couple of months ago when the \u201cbest\u201d / UHS Ustream channels started acting up.    I don\u2019t run apt-get update && upgrade \u2013 so there really should be nothing other than changes to livestreamer plugins or an issue with the way Ustream works that would be a factor here.   My \u201cidea\u201d was  on the Ustream side had changed.  It would not be the first time.   \nI will install VLC and also try the file output option as a test.  If it shows it\u2019s a player issue (omxplayer) that will be useful to know\u2026 although\u2026 nothing there has changed either (no new version installed of omxplayer).    \nVLC is not ideal as it doesn\u2019t support the GPU acceleration (and for anything other than the Pi2 model the CPU is already up around 85%+ when livestreamer is running).   \nJust curious - Do you have a Raspberry Pi to test this for yourself?\nThanks for the ideas in any case.   I\u2019ll get back to you.\nAnd... thanks so much for ALL you do to support all of us using Livestreamer. \n. So - when I output to a file - instead of using omxplayer - it works perfectly and does not abort prematurely.  \nWhere does this leave me?  Should I make contact with omxplayer folks to see if they can provide some ideas?    I added a caching option to the player args - but that's not having any impact on the player stopping e.g.\n--player \"omxplayer --video_fifo 8\" --fifo\nJust some \"questions in my own head\" about this. \nWhy does this only cause a problem with UHS streams from Ustream?   Why not HLS also?\nWhy do YouTube Live or on-demand videos (even at very high bit-rate) work just fine?\n. good catch @jthall - yes when I output that file of the HDEV stream there are several jump points in it - which don't appear as all that bad based upon the content.  However when I capture something with live audio (ustream.tv/leolaporte) those jumps / breaks in the video really show up.   \nSo I agree I think this is indicating something may be up with the plugin for Ustream as far as UHS videos.    The video is rock solid for the mobile_478p version (HLS) - and it does not have the same dropouts at all. \n. @0880 omxplayer It aborts pretty quickly.   What happens is the video starts up... within a second or two it freezes... after maybe 5 seconds it unfreezes.. then omxplayer aborts a few seconds later.    \nI don't see anything that looks like an error message in the debug output.. it simply takes its time loading chunks, adding chunks, fetching module info in no particular order - then omxplayer just gives up and closes. \n. Also this issue seems similar to what is being described here\nAt least the reference to how the \"best\" stream is problematic - and yet the mobile_ streams work just fine\n. Seems this is a pretty intractable problem them - and rules out use of Ustream if this isn't something that can be worked out (unfortunately the level of programming / debug is above my capabilities).   I may have to work on NASA to allow me to stream my own version using some other cdn that works for HD streams (e.g. YouTube Live).   Not sure how quick I can get that done though!\nThanks for all the work on this issue so far.   I wish I could be of more help.\nOh.. not sure if this is a NASA Ustream specific thing - or a Ustream thing in general but my backup stream of mobile_480p disappeared and was switched over to mobile_478p instead.    It's a mystery to me how those streams get generated and we end up with all the dozens of stream types.    As I cannot use \"best\" and \"worst\" is just too low quality I'm stuck with coding an override for all my ISS-Above units to use a set stream - which means whenever this changes it messes up over 900 units I have running around the world.   I've now implemented and auto-update - so when this happens again - I can push the change out more easily... anyhow - that's my problem.  \n. I don't know the official approach to handling code review but I would love to be able to test your potential fix somehow.   I have close to 1000 users worldwide who I have locked to the mobile_478p stream and I so want to try getting everyone back on the 720p stream.   \nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jul 24, 2015, at 10:01 PM, jthall notifications@github.com wrote:\nok yes now it is running glitch-free, at least for me. It might be related to bandwidth as well. I have enough bandwidth to run several times real-time for the stream, so I can \"catch up\" if you will rather quickly. I'm curious to see what happens if you run this on a slower connection.\nAs I was playing with this, I noticed one schema failure for streams, and once I was \"unable to retrieve desktop streams\" so I'm looking at the first one to see what's wrong with the schema. I'm still not convinced this solution is the correct solution, because the messages appear to come less often for livestreamer clients than the flash client. Basically what I have done is the following:\n1: reuse the same connection to get more chunks rather than going through setup each time we want more chunks\n2: send playing() method to server (not convinced this is really required)\n3: relax chunk retrieval rules to fetch stale chunks that \"should\" be missing but are mysteriously still hanging around on the servers. This means when you try to pull chunks that cross a range boundary you will get \"earlier\" chunks rather than starting at the range boundary (thus the reason for \"missing\" chunks)\nTODO: handle failure cases better and make sure we didn't botch failure notifications\nHow do I get this put into a code review?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Sorry for the delay.  I tried working with the updates a month ago.  It didn't seem to improve things but I didn't test it fully then - and I've been busy since.    I really want this fix because my ISS-Above users are only getting a 478p stream from the ISS currently (HLS).    I'll carve out some time next week to really run it through it's paces.   Did you try it on the HDEV stream yourself?  \n. Might it be a Raspberry Pi specific thing?    I\u2019ll definitely get back to you ASAP then.  If I can re-test it all sooner than next week I will do that.    Thanks. \n. Done some  further testing.   \n\nFull disclosure - I might just be the worst person to be testing this - because I am unsure whether I am doing this properly.   I'm really pretty green with installing things from github - so ALL I did was replace the ustream.py on my Raspberry Pi with the updated ustreamtv.py that you have in your repo\nThe base version I have installed is 1.12.2 - and then I replaced ustreamtv.py\nWhenever I play a UHS stream (vs HLS) I still see the frequent drop outs (omxplayer quits).

I hope some of the guru's with this can help figure this out. \n. @paulguy - is the only change you made in the ustreamtv plugin?\n. Great.   Will be trying it out later (Rpi).   Unfortunately I'm still stuck with not being able to reliably play the desktop streams (UHS) anyway via a Pi - and I have to use the HLS (Mobile) streams anyway.\n. UPDATE:  I decided I needed to update my image with the latest kernel / firmware in prep for b+ (sudo apt-get update / upgrade and rpi-update.    \nSeems I was on a VERY old version of omxplayer.   Since doing the upgrade it looks like this pausing/buffering of ustream channels has been fixed. \n. I can confirm this too.   I use Livestreamer with my ISS-Above devices and users can no longer view the NASA HDEV video stream.   Verified no Ustream channel can be accessed.   \n@trUSTssc - is that some kind of a workarund / fix?  If so... can you explain how to apply that?\n. OK... probably obvious but I had to do a little \"thinking\" to work out where that change should go on my Pi.  \nSo I see it's in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/livestreamer/plugins/ustreamtv.py  \nthen just replace the existing line which starts _channel_id_re = with the provided fix above.\nAnd... that does seem to fix it.   \nThanks for showing what needs to be done.   \nWill this be included in a quick update... or do I need to implement a work-around in the meantime?\nI only have to get about 450 of my users to run the Livestreamer component update process - assuming 1.12.2 can be released right away.  Otherwise I'm likely going to have to get a little creative.\n. I'm also experiencing similar issues with Ustream channels (NASA HDEV and leolaporte).   Streams drop after a few seconds of playout.   Was pretty reliable in the past.   (This is on Raspberry Pi).   I know sometimes Ustream messes with stuff on their side that can break Livstreamer support.  Did they do that again?\npi@issabove ~/issabove $ livestreamer -l debug www.ustream.tv/leolaporte 480p --player omxplayer --fifo\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin ustreamtv for URL www.ustream.tv/leolaporte\n[plugin.ustreamtv][debug] Waiting for moduleInfo invoke\n[cli][info] Available streams: 240p, 240p_alt_akamai, 360p, 360p_alt_akamai, 480p, 480p_alt_akamai, 720p+ (best), 720p+_alt_akamai, mobile_240p (worst), mobile_360p, mobile_480p\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 480p (uhs)\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[cli][debug] Pre-buffering 8192 bytes\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1429895991 to queue\n[cli][info] Creating pipe livestreamerpipe-5780\n[cli][info] Starting player: omxplayer\n[stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1429895991 complete\n[cli][debug] Writing stream to output\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1429895995 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1429895996 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1429895997 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1429895995 complete\n[stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1429895996 complete\n[stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1429895997 complete\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1429895998 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1429895999 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1429896000 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1429896001 to queue\n[cli][info] Player closed\n[stream.uhs][debug] Closing worker thread\n[stream.uhs][debug] Closing writer thread\n[cli][info] Stream ended\n.

The 720p stream is UHS and the mobile_480p is HLS (I think).  \nStreaming 720p or higher from other sources (e.g YouTube) works great.\n. This is a continuing problem.   I can no longer use Livestreamer for any UHS stream on Ustream.   \nThis is what I see on the leolaporte stream (just as an example - my main use is the NASA HDEV stream)\npi@issabove ~ $ livestreamer -l debug http://www.ustream.tv/leolaporte best --player omxplayer --fifo\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin ustreamtv for URL http://www.ustream.tv/leolaporte\n[plugin.ustreamtv][debug] Waiting for moduleInfo invoke\n[cli][info] Available streams: 240p, 240p_alt_akamai, 360p, 360p_alt_akamai, 480p, 480p_alt_akamai, 720p+ (best), 720p+_alt_akamai, mobile_240p (worst), mobile_360p, mobile_478p\n[cli][info] Opening stream: 720p+ (uhs)\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[cli][debug] Pre-buffering 8192 bytes\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436037622 to queue\n[cli][info] Creating pipe livestreamerpipe-3070\n[cli][info] Starting player: omxplayer\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[cli][debug] Writing stream to output\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Download of chunk 1436037622 complete\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Fetching module info\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436037625 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436037626 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436037627 to queue\n[stream.uhs][debug] Adding chunk 1436037628 to queue\n[cli][info] Player closed\n[stream.uhs][debug] Closing worker thread\n[stream.uhs][debug] Closing writer thread\n[cli][info] Stream ended\nIf I use a HLS stream (e.g. mobile_478p) it works perfectly.   \nAny suggestion for a workaround?   I have about 900 users worldwide now - and they can no longer access the best quality video from the ISS.   \nAs a test I setup a re-stream of the HDEV video using my own streaming gear and created a live stream via YouTube Live.   That is supported perfectly in Livestreamer at 1080p.    So - it's definitely an ongoing issue just with Ustream UHS streams.    \nThanks!\n. You are testing on Windows - My issue is on the Raspberry Pi.  Can you think of some dependency on the Pi that would possibly be causing the issue?\n. The base image of the ISS-Above has remained unchanged from when it was working reliably until  a couple of months ago when the \u201cbest\u201d / UHS Ustream channels started acting up.    I don\u2019t run apt-get update && upgrade \u2013 so there really should be nothing other than changes to livestreamer plugins or an issue with the way Ustream works that would be a factor here.   My \u201cidea\u201d was  on the Ustream side had changed.  It would not be the first time.   \nI will install VLC and also try the file output option as a test.  If it shows it\u2019s a player issue (omxplayer) that will be useful to know\u2026 although\u2026 nothing there has changed either (no new version installed of omxplayer).    \nVLC is not ideal as it doesn\u2019t support the GPU acceleration (and for anything other than the Pi2 model the CPU is already up around 85%+ when livestreamer is running).   \nJust curious - Do you have a Raspberry Pi to test this for yourself?\nThanks for the ideas in any case.   I\u2019ll get back to you.\nAnd... thanks so much for ALL you do to support all of us using Livestreamer. \n. So - when I output to a file - instead of using omxplayer - it works perfectly and does not abort prematurely.  \nWhere does this leave me?  Should I make contact with omxplayer folks to see if they can provide some ideas?    I added a caching option to the player args - but that's not having any impact on the player stopping e.g.\n--player \"omxplayer --video_fifo 8\" --fifo\nJust some \"questions in my own head\" about this. \nWhy does this only cause a problem with UHS streams from Ustream?   Why not HLS also?\nWhy do YouTube Live or on-demand videos (even at very high bit-rate) work just fine?\n. good catch @jthall - yes when I output that file of the HDEV stream there are several jump points in it - which don't appear as all that bad based upon the content.  However when I capture something with live audio (ustream.tv/leolaporte) those jumps / breaks in the video really show up.   \nSo I agree I think this is indicating something may be up with the plugin for Ustream as far as UHS videos.    The video is rock solid for the mobile_478p version (HLS) - and it does not have the same dropouts at all. \n. @0880 omxplayer It aborts pretty quickly.   What happens is the video starts up... within a second or two it freezes... after maybe 5 seconds it unfreezes.. then omxplayer aborts a few seconds later.    \nI don't see anything that looks like an error message in the debug output.. it simply takes its time loading chunks, adding chunks, fetching module info in no particular order - then omxplayer just gives up and closes. \n. Also this issue seems similar to what is being described here\nAt least the reference to how the \"best\" stream is problematic - and yet the mobile_ streams work just fine\n. Seems this is a pretty intractable problem them - and rules out use of Ustream if this isn't something that can be worked out (unfortunately the level of programming / debug is above my capabilities).   I may have to work on NASA to allow me to stream my own version using some other cdn that works for HD streams (e.g. YouTube Live).   Not sure how quick I can get that done though!\nThanks for all the work on this issue so far.   I wish I could be of more help.\nOh.. not sure if this is a NASA Ustream specific thing - or a Ustream thing in general but my backup stream of mobile_480p disappeared and was switched over to mobile_478p instead.    It's a mystery to me how those streams get generated and we end up with all the dozens of stream types.    As I cannot use \"best\" and \"worst\" is just too low quality I'm stuck with coding an override for all my ISS-Above units to use a set stream - which means whenever this changes it messes up over 900 units I have running around the world.   I've now implemented and auto-update - so when this happens again - I can push the change out more easily... anyhow - that's my problem.  \n. I don't know the official approach to handling code review but I would love to be able to test your potential fix somehow.   I have close to 1000 users worldwide who I have locked to the mobile_478p stream and I so want to try getting everyone back on the 720p stream.   \nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jul 24, 2015, at 10:01 PM, jthall notifications@github.com wrote:\nok yes now it is running glitch-free, at least for me. It might be related to bandwidth as well. I have enough bandwidth to run several times real-time for the stream, so I can \"catch up\" if you will rather quickly. I'm curious to see what happens if you run this on a slower connection.\nAs I was playing with this, I noticed one schema failure for streams, and once I was \"unable to retrieve desktop streams\" so I'm looking at the first one to see what's wrong with the schema. I'm still not convinced this solution is the correct solution, because the messages appear to come less often for livestreamer clients than the flash client. Basically what I have done is the following:\n1: reuse the same connection to get more chunks rather than going through setup each time we want more chunks\n2: send playing() method to server (not convinced this is really required)\n3: relax chunk retrieval rules to fetch stale chunks that \"should\" be missing but are mysteriously still hanging around on the servers. This means when you try to pull chunks that cross a range boundary you will get \"earlier\" chunks rather than starting at the range boundary (thus the reason for \"missing\" chunks)\nTODO: handle failure cases better and make sure we didn't botch failure notifications\nHow do I get this put into a code review?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Sorry for the delay.  I tried working with the updates a month ago.  It didn't seem to improve things but I didn't test it fully then - and I've been busy since.    I really want this fix because my ISS-Above users are only getting a 478p stream from the ISS currently (HLS).    I'll carve out some time next week to really run it through it's paces.   Did you try it on the HDEV stream yourself?  \n. Might it be a Raspberry Pi specific thing?    I\u2019ll definitely get back to you ASAP then.  If I can re-test it all sooner than next week I will do that.    Thanks. \n. Done some  further testing.   \n\nFull disclosure - I might just be the worst person to be testing this - because I am unsure whether I am doing this properly.   I'm really pretty green with installing things from github - so ALL I did was replace the ustream.py on my Raspberry Pi with the updated ustreamtv.py that you have in your repo\nThe base version I have installed is 1.12.2 - and then I replaced ustreamtv.py\nWhenever I play a UHS stream (vs HLS) I still see the frequent drop outs (omxplayer quits).

    "LEChaney": "Haven't implemented HLS seek support yet but I have gotten HTTP Progressive streams to support seek when using an HTTP player transport mode (--player-http or --player-http-continuous). I tested with VLC. Haven't tested with other players yet. Here is the pull request #1311\n. Also #1311 pull request for seek support for Progressive HTTP streams\n. It should work on any video link that would work using the existing httpstream:// protocol. That is any link that is simply embedded in an HTML5 video element ie:\nhtml\n<video controls>\n    <source src=\"http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/videos/big_buck_bunny.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\nOr any direct http link to a complete video file\n. I am closing this pull request to make a new one (#1311) that that also includes SegmentedHTTP but the stream type is now automatically selected from HTTPStream or SegmentedHTTP based on the value of the --stream-segment-threads option. This new pull request will focus on seek support for Progressive HTTP streams.\n. Future plans to make a plugin for AnimeLab which uses Progressive HTTP to stream video.\nAlso plan on implementing seek support for HLS streams, Crunchyroll in particular.\n. Thanks, is that the entire error you received? Our did you get a full stack traces well? I'm not sure where that init method is being called.\nUnfortunately livestreamersrv won't currently work with seeking as it doesn't handle seek requests sent from the player. In order to make this work you currently have to get the first byte position from the http range header in the request sent by the player and pass it to the stream's open method. Since livestreamersrv is using its own http server it isn't passing this info onto the stream.\nI currently have to pass the seek_pos parameter around to everything and make sure I don't pass it to anything that's not expecting it which I feel is very dirty. I'm working on proper event system to distribute seek events to subscribers 'only' which should fix issues like this, but if you have more details I can probably do a quick bug fix so at least it doesn't crash.\n. Thanks for the update. I might take a look at livestreamersrv at a later date once I have hls seek done. I'm a little confused at the moment as to why travis can't complete the python 2.6 build. All the tests run fine on my computer running a 2.6 environment....\n. Finished implementing HLS seek support. Also accelerated stream loading significantly. Streams should now open much faster and have less stream delay on live streams.\n. Ah, it's because I check for content length in the HTTP headers.\nHere are the headers from that server:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Length: 0\nContent-type: application/octet-stream\nCache-Control: no-cache\nIt's also missing the accepts ranges header, so seek and multi-segmented downloading is impossible. I'll try to make it fall back to single threaded downloading if the content-length is zero or the accepts-range header is missing.\nIn the mean time you can solve this by setting the stream-segment-threads option to 1 so that the single threaded streaming method is used.\n. Does --player-continuous-http not work for you? It should keep trying to reconnect if the stream goes down.\n. I think I see what you mean. To be honest, I'm not really working on this anymore as it was taking up too much of my time. There are definitely still some bugs, but they happen rarely (only when I'm trying to break it so far). The issue is probably related to player read and segment download maximum retry attempts and timeouts. I've done some initial testing and I seem to get deadlock when I try to simulate the stream going offline with --http-reconnect. Are you getting any timeouts/retries in the console?\n. Can you confirm whether things are working as expected without my changes? I'm not really sure what's happening with that stream, it goes through a bunch of 302 redirects then ends on a 404 for me.\nAlso segmented streams won't work unless there is a known content length (for HTTP progressive streams) as discussed above. It's different for HLS streams because there are multiple segments available with known sizes even for live streams, so each of them can downloaded in parallel. With an HTTP progressive stream I have know way of knowing how far ahead the video has been buffered server side, or whether the server will even respond appropriately to a byte range request unless I see the accepts ranges header in the server response.\n. Some issues with my current code and possible improvements:\n- Errors when seeking all the way to the end of a VOD stream.\n- Can take a long time to open HLS streams with many segments, as I need the complete size information, which can only be acquired by prefetching the headers for every segment in the stream. This can take a long time for streams with small segments (like twitch VODs). This is probably very hard to fix without a big architectural change to the way livestreamer core returns stream data (make it a proxy server for different stream types, players then interpret the stream type (i.e. HLS) properly and can make proper seek requests without needing the content length of the entire VOD).\n- Currently creates an additional layer of buffering, one for each queued segment (the queue size is 20). All of these buffers can download and fill, regardless of whether the main buffer is full or not. The segment threads option doesn't affect this (once the thread is finished it is free to download the next segment in the queue, which has it's own buffer to fill). This means the real buffer size is something like the main (ringbuffer) buffer size + 20 * segment-buffer-size. It would be better (albeit a lot more complex) to have one segmented buffer that everything can read into in a parallel manner without overwriting each other's data, and which blocks when full.\n- Currently all buffered data is thrown out once a seek request is received, even if it could be reused. The two situations where we should be able to reuse data are: When we seek ahead, but not past the point where we don't have any data. When we seek backwards within some buffered window in which data is saved for seek purposes.\nPossible architectural improvements:\n- Change livestreamer core to act as a proxy server, with only HTTP output. This way other applications which implement their own servers currently, no longer have to, and don't have to worry about forwarding content size information in order for seek support to work.\n- Mailbox communication system should be changed to work like Golang channels for consistency/simplicity. \n- A lot of code could be cleaned up by moving more into the stream type base classes.\n- Some of the HLS segmented stream stuff should be rewritten so I'm not hacking mutable fields onto an immutable type to store stream length data.\n. I think a new fork with new maintainers might be a good idea at this point. Also sorry to say that my fork is quite a lot of extra code and I didn't write any tests for it. It probably needs tidying up quite a bit. I used a lot of threading, and it's prone to deadlock issues. The mailbox behavior should be changed to work like a golang channel to make it a bit more consistent. When I wrote it I was trying to add code without changing too much existing stuff. A lot of it could probably be rewritten to be a lot simpler.\n. I've posted some stuff about the issues I currently have with my own fork over at #1311 \nI think anyone looking at creating a new fork of this would need to be quite dedicated to it. There are a lot of things to think about like, a new website, checking any licensing issues, setting up continuous integration / deployment of binaries, documentation, making sure there is good test coverage, making sure the tests are actually useful, making sure you don't accept any pull requests into master that would break anything, and continued development of the project. \nI think it would be a good idea for anyone serious about making a new fork to create a Patreon page to support the core maintainers of the package, so that there is something to justify their time input other than \"just being a cool project\". The fork I made was my first real crack at making some fairly significant changes to an open source project, and it was a lot more work than I thought it would be.\nIn saying that, you will learn a lot of useful stuff doing this, I'd be tempted to do this myself if I thought I would get good Patreon support and could keep my hours to say 10 hours a week.\n. @cdrage Me too.\n.

Yesterday there was old url.\n. The problem is in changed stream URL. It becomes invalid. See example for cnn:\nwget -qO - \"http://www.mobileonline.tv/channel.php?n=68967\" | grep xs=_we\nIt is similar error output above. You should scrape out from output 3 MRL for rtmp:, rtsp: and http: and replace # with hostname watch1.streamlive.to. Unfortunately this is not sufficient. There are something more we should to do.\n. You can use this script to scrap out clean right stream URLs:\nwget -qO - \"http://www.mobileonline.tv/channel.php?n=68967\" | \ngrep -Eo '[a-z]+://#:1935/edge/definst/[[:alnum:]]+.*\\?xs=_we[^ ]+' | \nsed 's%#%watch1.streamlive.to%' \nRegrettably, but those URL doesn't work. It needs more investigations\n. It says it is for premium account, but this channel is free available on site. So it looks like auth problem.\n. No. This is auth problem. Those URLs are not authorized. So, there should exists some other way to get URL.\n. Here is solution. Log in on \nhttp://m.streamlive.to/login  \nwith Your user name and password and save cookies. Then get e.g. \nhttp://m.streamlive.to/view/68967 \nusing saved cookies and cut out from there stream MRL with command:\ngrep -Po \"<video .* src=\\\"\\K[^\\\"]+\"\n. Actually logging in not needed.

Yes, because the urls like http://www.streamlive.to/view/ changed to http://www.streamlive.to/view-channel/\nThey do similar changes again and again in order we to have a work.\n. They rolled back from http://www.streamlive.to/view-channel to http://www.streamlive.to/view. Again. Ridiculous. \n. Don't understand. What do mean? This changing in url appears just today. Yesterday there was old url.\n. The problem is in changed stream URL. It becomes invalid. See example for cnn:\nwget -qO - \"http://www.mobileonline.tv/channel.php?n=68967\" | grep xs=_we\nIt is similar error output above. You should scrape out from output 3 MRL for rtmp:, rtsp: and http: and replace # with hostname watch1.streamlive.to. Unfortunately this is not sufficient. There are something more we should to do.\n. You can use this script to scrap out clean right stream URLs:\nwget -qO - \"http://www.mobileonline.tv/channel.php?n=68967\" | \ngrep -Eo '[a-z]+://#:1935/edge/definst/[[:alnum:]]+.*\\?xs=_we[^ ]+' | \nsed 's%#%watch1.streamlive.to%' \nRegrettably, but those URL doesn't work. It needs more investigations\n. It says it is for premium account, but this channel is free available on site. So it looks like auth problem.\n. No. This is auth problem. Those URLs are not authorized. So, there should exists some other way to get URL.\n. Here is solution. Log in on \nhttp://m.streamlive.to/login  \nwith Your user name and password and save cookies. Then get e.g. \nhttp://m.streamlive.to/view/68967 \nusing saved cookies and cut out from there stream MRL with command:\ngrep -Po \"<video .* src=\\\"\\K[^\\\"]+\"\n. Actually logging in not needed.

Then You can run it this way:\nffplay http://localhost/cgi/streamlive?channel=57804\nThough You can run it from command line for debugging purpose only, for example this way:\nQUERY_STRING='pattern=CNN&show=1' ./streamlive\nIf You want to use it from command line for streaming, You should remove http headers inside script and pipe stream to player:\nQUERY_STRING='channel=57804' ./streamlive | ffplay -\nAgain: don't spend Your time for command line, but do configure Your server instead.\n.

It might even be best to rename it ITV (e.g. itv.py for the plugin file) if it can handle all of ITV's (free) streaming content (?). Although, worth noting, the plugin will of course work regardless of the actual name of the plugin (actual file or class name) -- basically if the can_handle_url() method returns True the plugin can handle the URL, otherwise not. I'll probably upload a patch for the name change though, or at least add a comment to the pull request.\n\nWell, in the 18 days that have passed since \nmy original post, they seem to have reverted \nITV1 (itv) streaming again back to RTMPE\n\nThat seems to be the case, yes. I discovered that while testing the patched version last night. Though as I made some of the code changes, including the HDS parsing, soon after your post (when they still used AdobeHDS in some fashion), I can confirm the HDS manifest was properly parsed and streams popped out. Maybe they'll reintroduce it, and in that case the code should handle it properly.\nSidenote for Linux: A strange thing I noticed was that under my Manjaro Linux boot, in which I wrote the patch, the stream quality (e.g. 600k, 800k, 1200k, etc.) would not indicate best/worst, thus (seemingly) failing at evaluating the qualities, and also missing the \"k\" after the number. Here, on my Windows boot the same code works as intended, with \"k\" and indicating best/worst. So I'm not sure exactly what is going on with that.\n.

I does work, but a command-line flag solution is probably better than simply removing the proxies.\n/tboss\n. > Since there's no longer an \"ITVPlayer\" site per se, \n\nI thought it was more appropriate to rename the \nplugin to \"ITVhub\"\n\nYou're right, it probably should be renamed as even the wikipedia article mentions this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_Hub . It might even be best to rename it ITV (e.g. itv.py for the plugin file) if it can handle all of ITV's (free) streaming content (?). Although, worth noting, the plugin will of course work regardless of the actual name of the plugin (actual file or class name) -- basically if the can_handle_url() method returns True the plugin can handle the URL, otherwise not. I'll probably upload a patch for the name change though, or at least add a comment to the pull request.\n\nWell, in the 18 days that have passed since \nmy original post, they seem to have reverted \nITV1 (itv) streaming again back to RTMPE\n\nThat seems to be the case, yes. I discovered that while testing the patched version last night. Though as I made some of the code changes, including the HDS parsing, soon after your post (when they still used AdobeHDS in some fashion), I can confirm the HDS manifest was properly parsed and streams popped out. Maybe they'll reintroduce it, and in that case the code should handle it properly.\nSidenote for Linux: A strange thing I noticed was that under my Manjaro Linux boot, in which I wrote the patch, the stream quality (e.g. 600k, 800k, 1200k, etc.) would not indicate best/worst, thus (seemingly) failing at evaluating the qualities, and also missing the \"k\" after the number. Here, on my Windows boot the same code works as intended, with \"k\" and indicating best/worst. So I'm not sure exactly what is going on with that.\n. ",

Ah thank you.\nThats why ive been trying for days without success to add a cookie.txt file.\nSo the cookie itself still has to be added to the line ?\n. Thanks Chrippa, I'm aware this is a GiTHub and not a help forum (but if you could point me in the right direction for that it would be great as google hasn't helped) could you show me the correct syntax for adding a cookie to the livestreamsvr example above please,the documentation is a bit vague and ive been struggling with this for ages.\n. Awesome your a star,\nPlacing it at the end was the one position ive not tried lol.\nThanks ever so much.\nIan.\n. This is from my telnet window when using the debug livestreamersrv manualstart\nlocalhost.localdomain - - [27/May/2015 12:24:10] \"GET /hls://http://iptv.wssiptv\n.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd/101.t HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\nlocalhost.localdomain - - [27/May/2015 12:24:10] URL: hls://http://iptv.wssiptv.\ncom:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd/101.t Quality: best\nStreams: ['live', 'worst', 'best']\n\nGot Exception:  Read timeout\nThe same stream plays when using the enigma2 onboard gstreamer,but this is poor in comparison to your excellent livestreamer.\n. Well Ive tried http and hlsvariant but using those cause a segfault,only using hls allows connection.\nSo what stream type do you think it is ?\nlocalhost.localdomain - - [27/May/2015 13:28:47] \"GET /httpstream://http://iptv.\nwssiptv.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd/101.t HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\nlocalhost.localdomain - - [27/May/2015 13:28:47] URL: httpstream://http://iptv.w\nssiptv.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd/101.t Quality: best\nStreams: ['live', 'worst', 'best']\n\nGot Exception:  No Data!\nhttp gives the exception no data\nlocalhost.localdomain - - [27/May/2015 13:30:49] \"GET /hlsvariant://http://iptv.\nwssiptv.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd/101.t HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\nlocalhost.localdomain - - [27/May/2015 13:30:49] URL: hlsvariant://http://iptv.w\nssiptv.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd/101.t Quality: best\nGot Exception:  No Stream Found!\nhlsvariant gives the above exception of no streams found\n. Yes this is why I asked about FFmpeg.\nI believe it may need that,although I'm far from sure,but as you say its fine with VLC and Enigma2 Gstreamer.\nI just cannot get it to play using Livestreamer hence me asking the question why here, because Livestreamer is always my preferred choice when streaming any live content.\nI thought perhaps there maybe another syntax that I'm unaware of ?\n. Many thanks chrippa.\nAs usual your a star and provider excellent support for us simpletons.\nAll links to that server are now working through Livestreamer,so everything now remains in sync during playback (a major problem when using gstreamer)so all is now sorted.\nAgain thank you.\nIan.\n. Hi\nSorry to reopen this issue but can you tell me how to add player continuous http to this livestreamersrv line ?\nhttpstream://http://iptv.wssiptv.com:80/live/VIPWSS/OUEIjhuawoijasd.ts  headers={'User-Agent': 'Android 4.0.4'}\nbecause often the streams just stop and the only way to get them to play again is to exit and restart.\nThe above url is now dead,its just the principle that I need.\n. ok thank you\n. Excellent work.\nSeek when using Livestreamer will be a major enhancement.\nHowever,when trying to stream I get this.\nGot Exception:  init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'seek_pos'\nThis is using an enigma2 VU+ Solo2 and livestreamersrv\nIf I revert back to the development version without your latest commits the stream plays perfectly.\nIan.\n. It doesnt crash, it just doesnt stream.\nThe error was obtained from telnet using livestreamersrv manualstart\nthen selecting the stream on my VU+ Solo2.\nUsually there's loads of info about the pipe ect but your version just gives\nGot Exception: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'seek_pos'\nNo other info at all.\nIt does this on both http streams and HLS streams. I didnt test HDS or rtmp\nThat's a real blow about seek not going to work when using the livestreamersrv deamon as its sadly been missing from enigma2 boxes when using Livestreamer and I do know that there are many,many enigma2 users who would like this feature.\nAh well never mind lol\nIan.\n. Just to let you know.\nYour latest fixes now start and stream perfectly on an Enigma2 box using Livestreamersrv\nIan.\n.

Hi\nI did a check on this in an attempt to fix this but it seems that the API that the plugin is using is no longer returning enough information for the plugin to work. It is lacking all the streaming information. Probably in an attempt to block livestreamer or any form of non official website based streaming.\nUnfortunately I do not understand the plugin well enough to modify it such that it parse the website instead. I am trying to see if there is any other alternative.\n. I do realise that there is an alternative api that still return the correct information. But the problem I think is it needs to get a key that expires every 5 minutes. \nhttp://www.douyutv.com/swf_api/room/{ROOMNUMBER}?cdn=&nofan=yes&_t=23792847&sign={SOMEKEYTHATEXPIREEVERY5MINUTES}\nI have not figure out what is with the t though.\n\nAnyone familiar with updating of plugin, can drop me some hint on how exactly such problem can be tackled?\n. Hi\nI have nearly a complete feature on what to call but I am just not sure how to actually write it properly in the plugin since the plugin have no documentation so pretty much I am guessing what can be done in there. Another question is how do I test my modification? \n. Hi\nI do understand the test that I have to run to see if the code breaks anything but whatever testing the fix that I created? I tried python main.py on cli to \"run\" it but that does not work. I believe I am not supposed to do that but I cannot figure out which is the correct method to do so.\n. Hi maybe I was not clear enough but I did follow those steps already. My problem being how do I run the cli part to do a test.\nLike when i normally use the application I do livestreamer douyutv.com/23142, and I encounter an error. So I did the steps in livestreamer specific instructions to actually get the latest base and test if it is actually fixed. If not I will start do modify the source to get it to work but lets assume I done the necessary change I require. How could I run the modified version?\n. Ah that explain why. Thanks a lot for the help. I actually have problem with the virtual environment install so I skipped it thinking that it will just pollute my main Python environment but did not realize the impact. Thanks for solving the mystery.\n\nOn 29 Mar 2015, at 10:00 pm, Christopher Rosell notifications@github.com wrote:\nWhen you have the virtualenv activated it will use the code from the directory you ran python setup.py develop from.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Hi\nI did a check on this in an attempt to fix this but it seems that the API that the plugin is using is no longer returning enough information for the plugin to work. It is lacking all the streaming information. Probably in an attempt to block livestreamer or any form of non official website based streaming.\nUnfortunately I do not understand the plugin well enough to modify it such that it parse the website instead. I am trying to see if there is any other alternative.\n. I do realise that there is an alternative api that still return the correct information. But the problem I think is it needs to get a key that expires every 5 minutes. \nhttp://www.douyutv.com/swf_api/room/{ROOMNUMBER}?cdn=&nofan=yes&_t=23792847&sign={SOMEKEYTHATEXPIREEVERY5MINUTES}\nI have not figure out what is with the t though.\n\nAnyone familiar with updating of plugin, can drop me some hint on how exactly such problem can be tackled?\n. Hi\nI have nearly a complete feature on what to call but I am just not sure how to actually write it properly in the plugin since the plugin have no documentation so pretty much I am guessing what can be done in there. Another question is how do I test my modification? \n. Hi\nI do understand the test that I have to run to see if the code breaks anything but whatever testing the fix that I created? I tried python main.py on cli to \"run\" it but that does not work. I believe I am not supposed to do that but I cannot figure out which is the correct method to do so.\n. Hi maybe I was not clear enough but I did follow those steps already. My problem being how do I run the cli part to do a test.\nLike when i normally use the application I do livestreamer douyutv.com/23142, and I encounter an error. So I did the steps in livestreamer specific instructions to actually get the latest base and test if it is actually fixed. If not I will start do modify the source to get it to work but lets assume I done the necessary change I require. How could I run the modified version?\n. Ah that explain why. Thanks a lot for the help. I actually have problem with the virtual environment install so I skipped it thinking that it will just pollute my main Python environment but did not realize the impact. Thanks for solving the mystery.\n\nOn 29 Mar 2015, at 10:00 pm, Christopher Rosell notifications@github.com wrote:\nWhen you have the virtualenv activated it will use the code from the directory you ran python setup.py develop from.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. \n",

But i rather use w/o cache now since i don't want the disk I/O operations, which in my case was giving me some little freezes, which i imagine was due to reading from cache.\nThe shame here is that i made UNIX a dependence, maybe i should make a python script or something in order to make it portable to windows.\nSo, right now i am using the below function:\narconai(){\n    command livestreamer --player mpv hls://$(curl \"$*\" | grep m3u8 | cut -d '\"' -f 6) live\n}. For anyone keeping track of this thing, Arconai has recently changed his page so changes were necessary in order for livestreamer to work with it. Here goes the changes:\ncommand livestreamer --player $player hls://$(curl $url | grep m3u8 | cut -d '\"' -f 14 | sed 's/\\\\//g') live. ",

Do you think any segments are missing?\n[stream.hls][warning] Failed to reload playlist: Unable to open URL: h ttp://manifest.googlevideo.com/api/manifest/hls_playlist/id/iGTIK_8ydoI.1/itag/151/source/yt_live_broa dcast/ratebypass/yes/live/1/cmbypass/yes/gir/yes/dg_shard/aUdUSUtfOHlkb0kuMQ.151/hls_chunk_host/r8---s n-5uaeznzs.googlevideo.com/pmbypass/yes/playlist_type/LIVE/maudio/1/gcr/id/mm/32/ms/lv/mv/m/nh/IgpwcjA yLmF0bDAxKgkxMjcuMC4wLjE/pl/22/dover/2/sver/3/upn/eEEtQeoWksA/fexp/900720,907263,916732,924637,932627, 934954,9405985,9407115,9407407,9407669,9408093,9408347,9408618,9408705,9408787,9408940,947233,947243,9 48124,948703,951703,952612,952613,952615,952626,957201,961401,961404,961406/mt/1429162202/ip/63.142.25 0.163/ipbits/0/expire/1429183860/sparams/ip,ipbits,expire,id,itag,source,ratebypass,live,cmbypass,gir, dg_shard,hls_chunk_host,pmbypass,playlist_type,maudio,gcr,mm,ms,mv,nh,pl/signature/634DBA425279627B221 BC6936966EA5ADCF03BE5.8EA4833DADEB1C78C3019C7BA686DF7C661AF684/key/dg_yt0/file/index.m3u8 (500 Server Error: Internal Server Error)\n.

    "jthall": "This has been consistently happening for me for i.e. nasa-media-channel and live-iss-stream. The normal browser streams work fine, i.e. load them in msie.\nWhen it has played out its chunks, it says fetching module info and hangs until it is able to fetch some more chunks. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be able to fetch module info.  What causes it to fetch module info anyway? when the playlist for the chunks runs out?\nexample cmd\nlivestreamer -l debug -p \"mplayer -vo null -ao jack -\" http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-media-channel 720p+\n. I ran livestreamer with the -O flag like this\nlivestreamer -l debug -O http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-media-channel 720p+ >media.flv\nand then let it run for a while until I saw several loading module msgs, then once it started receiving chunks again I viewed the file in vlc.   The file had missing video, i.e. commentator was talking and then stopped mid sentence. (it was running ISS Live at the time) so for me the -O redirected to a file has problems and seems to have more problems consistently.  In addition, I ran a church service earlier this evening which aborted with a crash because it had an unknown video parameter when retrieving the first chunk.  The stream is not live now, so I don't think it would give the same error.\nIt does seem as if there are some corner cases missing in the ustreamtv plugin that we might be hitting either by design by ustream or just dumb luck.  My python skills are not great, so it will take me a little while to fully understand the logic in the plugin. In any rate, it should be pretty reproducible. Do we think the problem is in the ustream plugin or librtmp python library? Both were updated about the time this seemed to start for me.\nDid you look at some interactive content like public channel / education channel, or were you looking at hdev? Is it possible the content was fairly static when you looked so you thought the video was not having problems?\nPlease check an interactive feed such as nasa public or nasa education and verify it works for you. I am seeing this on python-2.7 and Linux.\n. I'm watching the educational channel now and I think either the penalty applied to us is time-based and since we can fetch a lot of chunks, we may get further and further behind in the delay blocks, or maybe you don't get penalized for lower bitrate streams. I suspect the penalty may be happening because we pull chunks with a new http session rather than using the same one like the flash players.  If you run the 240p feed for a long time like half an hour, do you see one massive gap or is the player somehow able to keep up?\nPlus by capturing it to a file and then playing it back, you have the ability to stall out for a long time, then fetch a whole bunch of chunks at faster-than-real-time and catch up.  If, on the other htand, you are playing it out in real-time, I suspect the 240P feeds will pause as well, although admittedly it doesn't seem to be as bad as the other hd feeds, so maybe there reall yaren't any gaps after all.\nYou can really see the gaps like this\nlivestreamer -O http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-media-channel 720p|mplayer -vo null -ao jack -\nYou'll see the gaps if you watch the status crawl output of mplayer and you will see it loading module info at that time repeatedly.\nI think a good place to start here would be to find out what the code path is when loading module info and a chunk is not retrieved. That might tell us a clue.  I'm seeing gaps in the 240p stream as it waits, but those gaps would not be visible if you're playing a file back because you can play right through the gap as if no time had elapsed.\nso as long as the chunk you want when you are behind is available in the CDN ringbuffer, and if you can download faster than real-time, you should be able to retrieve all the chunks before they disappear.  If you are seeing 404s for the 720P streams, you may be trying to pull a chunk that is older than the \"ringbuffer\" available on the CDN for the channel.\nIt's not really a ringbuffer but you get the idea, older chunks are purged to make way for new ones.  Since all the clients probably run at different points in time, there needs to be a little bit of overlap between now and the past.  We may be simply dealing with the amount of time it takes to go set up a new session with a penalty from ustream.\nConsider from ustream's point of view. They don't want livestreamer to run, but they do want multiple people behind a NAT to be able to watch the same stream. They can't simply limit each IP to one session, and they don't want too big of a delay for the flash player to load. The solution is to penalize an IP that misbehaves or is particularly active, probably with some sort of weighted penalty.\nI've been watching educational channel for the duration of typing this post and only see some minor blips as we pull new content and waiting for the next chunk.\nThis particular channel, if memory serves, is actually an SD feed on the NASA mux. I see they have a 720P feed for it, so they might have begun encoding education in HD. I can check, but I'm pretty sure the satellite feed for Education channel is SD, that may be part of why we are able to pull this without interruption.\nThe 240P stream for live-iss-stream is not so forgiving.  I just saw a small gap in the education feed of about 5 or more lost seconds in the video. I did not actually see it in the frame count output, instead the content playing out had a jump.\n. so what would need to happen to remember enough state across callbacks so we can reuse the same session each time we want to pull some chunks? It seems that might be the reason, but maybe not the entire story.\n. I've been digging into this a little over the last couple days. I had hoped to fix it before the Soyuz docking, but that didn't happen.\nI looked at implementing a harmless change, like reporting the number of concurrent viewers to the caller. I got it to report a float (i.e. there are 505.0 viewers of this stream) but I think I know how to fix that, just use int instead of int / float in the schema definition. This is my first python adventure so things are going a little bit slower than I had hoped, but not much.\nNext looking at what appears to be going on, ustream sends moduleInfo messages towards the client after connect.  In the flash version wireshark packets, the client (after receiving the moduleInfo message) sends a playing() call, and then waits for more moduleInfo messages.  Every so often, it sends stats() messages.\nLivestreamer connects, gets a single moduleInfo() message and then hangs up on the connection.  The next time he connects, he gets the same moduleInfo() message and thus the same chunk he has already downloaded.  Finding no new chunks, he hangs up and trys again.  I don't know how rapidly this sequence happens, but ustream probably penalizes him because he is constantly connecting.\nso things on today's todo:\nmake it send the playing() message towards ustream\nmodify the main process thread to not hang up upon single moduleInfo() message, and verify this is going to be thread-safe when two or more are running at the same time since at first glance it looks as if the flash version might run two threads.\nThen I will figure out if the stats methods are required, if it is possible to deal with them, and report back on my progress.\nI may leave the number of viewers in there. I also added a video codec check in the schema so in the future if somebody wants to they can implement some sort of \"this stream is mpeg4, this one is mpeg2\" so that the livestreamer could be told to pick an mp4 vs mp2 stream or whatever.  At the moment, however, they're all coming up mpeg4 / h264.\nSo even though all I have really done is added a printable, I now understand the ustream plugin code better. I suppose that's a win. :)\n. well I've got it reusing the connection, but I'm not convinced it is much better.  I'm not convinced it isn't either. I tried to implement the playing() call but it doesn't look right in the tcpdump since I didn't encode the reason object. Nevertheless, the moduleInfo objects keep showing up, only thing is it skips chunks because it isn't offered them. I'm in #livestreamer on freenode if you want to work this real-time.\n. I've tried a couple things, and here are my results:\nPrefetching \"old\" chunks does not work, i.e. let's say the chunk number is 55, and the range is from 48 to 58, chunks 49 - 54 are not available (404)\nI tried prefetching the future, and that doesn't work either--I was able to prefetch maybe one or two chunks in advance, but got 404s for the rest (I tried to fetch the whole range)\nand, with the current implementation, if you get a 404, you'll never try the chunk again. This is because the chunk is already in the chunks list and the iterator to add chunks checks the list before adding the chunk again.  I'm hesitant to try to add a new field to Chunks that indicates whether the chunk was downloaded or not because that would require some synchronization between the worker thread and the writer thread.  As it stands, it probably isn't thread-safe unless there's some mechanism in python that protects lists or named tuples.\nThe way I see it there are two possibilities.\n1: need to implement the stats() function to relay back to ustream which chunks were downloaded\n2: investigate why we are not responding to set bandwidth calls from ustream.  Both suspiciously look like they might solve the problem.  The flash player does both.\nIn any rate by singly connecting and implementing the playing() call, things seem substantially better, I'm missing two chunks, and I have a thought about maybe coaxing the download thread into fetching them late. Hopefully that will provide an unbroken stream, and hopefully it will not starve out a player.\nIf you're curious, this is with the nasa media channel that operates at 720P.  Not having proper AMF3 support is proving to be a bit annoying because my ustream calls don't look like the flashplayer calls. Hopefully ustream can read amf0 still, but that will probably go away in the future.\nAnyway it's getting better.\n. ok yes now it is running glitch-free, at least for me.  It might be related to bandwidth as well.  I have enough bandwidth to run several times real-time for the stream, so I can \"catch up\" if you will rather quickly.  I'm curious to see what happens if you run this on a slower connection.\nAs I was playing with this, I noticed one schema failure for streams, and once I was \"unable to retrieve desktop streams\" so I'm looking at the first one to see what's wrong with the schema.  I'm still not convinced this solution is the correct solution, because the messages appear to come less often for livestreamer clients than the flash client.  Basically what I have done is the following:\n1: reuse the same connection to get more chunks rather than going through setup each time we want more chunks\n2: send playing() method to server (not convinced this is really required)\n3: relax chunk retrieval rules to fetch stale chunks that \"should\" be missing but are mysteriously still hanging around on the servers. This means when you try to pull chunks that cross a range boundary you will get \"earlier\" chunks rather than starting at the range boundary (thus the reason for \"missing\" chunks)\nTODO: handle failure cases better and make sure we didn't botch failure notifications\nHow do I get this put into a code review?\n. I've put my changes in https://github.com/jthall/livestreamer.git\nLet me know how that works for you.  It appears there may still be a small hang upon start, but then you don't see it after that. I think that might make omxplayer unhappy, but you can let me know since yo uuse that.\n. I have noticed that as well, and am running some parallel tests between the mobile stream and the uhs stream. I think the timeout msgs are because our tolerences are too stringent.  I think I may have botched the exception mechanism, so it will never fail in the module info process loop. We are benefiting from that because the player eventually does get the chunks.\nBasically it goes like this.\nThe module info message informs the client of some information. Sometimes that information is the streams object. This one tells us about new chunks. The plugin gets mad if we come out of the module info block without a valid streams object, so I wrote a loop that iterates 50 times through module infos looking for valid streams object.  At some point it decides the timeout has been reached and whines about it. Whether that is between getting module info messages or ones we view as valid I don't know.  I'm sure this code could be refactored a bit, but this was a 'first step' to see if the logic is sound.\nI found another stream that the flv parser doesn't like, that is probably an unrelated bug, but since that stream does not broadcast all the time it is difficult to test with it. Maybe it is due to whatever is encoding the service. I know the broadcaster and can contact them to find out about it.  If you find some more streams that just flat out don't work let me know.\n. so it's been a little over a month. How is the testing going with your streams, @liamkennedy? I haven't really looked at this in great detail over the last month, life got busy.\n. yes I have tested all the streams and they're seemingly working fine.\nI would be interested in why it was not working for you, so do please\npost your observations.\nOn 9/8/15, liamkennedy notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSorry for the delay.

Did you try it on\nthe HDEV stream yourself?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/860#issuecomment-138729123\n. error #5 is a template problem that I have seen only once and should\ncause livestreamer to exit.  The fact that it does not exit is an\nindication the new module info while loop is too aggressive in keeping\nitself running.\n\nerror #6 is probably a bandwidth() call not being processed, i.e. we\ndo not send them and so the module info call comes too infrequently.\nThat means we are either attempting to prefetch a chunk too early, (in\nthe future) or too late (chunk rolled off the available chunks)\nThe reason the code is working more stabily now is a bit of a hack.\nBasically the logic says if you were told you could take chunks 50 -\n55, then 60 - 70, the app will go ahead and try to fetch 55-60 even\nthough that is outside the bounds of what the app was told it could\nfetch.  The module info call basically gives a range of available\nchunks and what the \"active\" chunk is. You can't prefetch between the\n\"active\" and \"end of avails\" window because that is apparently in the\nfuture, you regularly get 404s if you try that. You can get \"stale\"\nchunks that are older than the start of the avails window. At one time\nI intended to implement the bandwidth() function to just tell the\nustream servers we want 1.5m or whatever the flash version sends (I\ndon't remember off the top of my head) but the servers may require\nRTMPv3 towards the server (currently livestreamer can receive an\nRTMPv3 payload, but not generate one)\nWhen you set the bandwidth properly, you get the module info calls\nfrom the server more often, so you don't have problems with stale\nchunks.  The app is only told about new chunks when it gets a module\ninfo message from the server.  If the app is told more often that new\nchunks are available, it never is trying to retrieve chunks outside\nthe avails window.\nI don't know if I will have tons of time to look at this this week,\nbut maybe the servers will take v0 objects instead of requiring v3\nobjects.\nOn 9/13/15, ErAzOr2k notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOutput from debug log:\n2015-09-13 15:13:22.241 spawn:

GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/860#issuecomment-139873310\n. hmm maybe the reason my version seems to slow down is that if the\nmoduleinfo calls come late and so we backfill fetching, but then play\nout in real-time, since the player is playing all chunks in real-time,\nit is possible it will be behind because it doesn't \"skip\" chunks like\nthe official version does. How far behind does it get over a period of\ntime? It could catch up if module info calls are late, but then it\nwants to play all the \"back\" or missing video. This means the\nartificial delay imposed by ustream for us would make the player fall\nfurther and further behind. The only way you could stay current is if\nyou did not have a real-time component forcing playback at a constant\nrate.\n\nso to make this simpler, let's say you get 10 seconds of good video,\nthen ustream throttles and you have to wait 5 extra seconds before you\nare notified new video is available. Now if you get another 10 seconds\nof video, that 10 seconds will play out 5 seconds late. Each time\nthere is an artificial delay, the player is \"catching up\", but new\nvideo is presented to it at faster-than-real-time because the\nlivestreamer process is cheating and trying to scarf up old stale\nchunks before they disappear from the CDN.  The net.effect is that any\nartificially-introduced delay from ustream will slow down a real-time\nplayer forever until either the viewer can process video at\nfaster-than-real-time rates or gives up.\nSo it appears we currently have two choices--either to watch with the\nofficial livestreamer and sortta keep up with real-time but have\ndamaged video and missing chunks, or use my player and slowly drift\nbehind over time until we overflow the input buffer of the player and\ndrop a lot of video.\nAdmittedly I spent more time working with archiving instead of live\nvideo. Either the bandwidth command makes ustream deliver chunks more\non-time or there's something else we're missing.  I'm not going to\nhave much time over the next couple weeks to dig deeper into this, but\nI do hope to get back around to looking at it again.\nOn 10/3/15, liamkennedy notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOh wow.

Are you wanting the content to write to a single file even if the stream ends and then restarts?\n\nYou might be able to use a shell script and use vlc to output .ts format to a file, that way you don't have to deal with flv headers in the middle of your file.  If you use () in your script, you can put the livestreamer command in a loop that behaves, like sleeps between attempts to get an offline stream.\n. Hi,\nI'm not familiar with this command syntax. oh wait a minute this\n:start is a label. I understand now.\nI must admit I'm not familiar with the variable substitution used. Are\nyou trying to archive this stream on a daily basis, play it with a\nflash player, or something else?\nThe simplest solution here might be to use ffmpeg to read the flash\ncontent on stdin and then output with -f mpegts -v copy so it doesn't\ntry to transcode anything, then write the output to a file. You could,\nfor example, do something like this. This example isn't for what you\nwant, this example pulls the audio, deletes the silence, and then\nencodes it at mono 48khz.  There's probably a better way to do it than\nthis, but it works. You basically run this command and use >> to write\nthe mp3 to a file.  The gist here is the stuffin () gets executed as a\nsingle shot and the lame process stays open because stdout of the\nparent never closes due to the while loop never exits. The lame\nprocess then takes raw audio on its stdin and encodes it.\n!/bin/sh\n(\nwhile [ 1 ]\ndo\nlivestreamer -O --stream-segment-threads 6\nhttp://www.ustream.tv/channel/live-iss-stream\n240p,240+,240p+_alt_akamai,mobile_284p| mplayer - -novideo\n-really-quiet -nocache -ao pcm:nowaveheader:file=/dev/stdout |\necasound -q -f:f32_le,2,48000 -i stdin -R -enm:0.15,2000,60,5,60\n-ge:0.15,0.01,1,-1 -f:s16_le,2,48000 -erc:1,2 -o stdout\nsleep 5\ndone\n) | lame -s 48 -r -h -a -b 80 - -\nOn 9/3/15, poochiteap notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@0880  @jthall Thanks for your replies.\n@0880 I checked the link that you provided.

This has been consistently happening for me for i.e. nasa-media-channel and live-iss-stream. The normal browser streams work fine, i.e. load them in msie.\n\nWhen it has played out its chunks, it says fetching module info and hangs until it is able to fetch some more chunks. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be able to fetch module info.  What causes it to fetch module info anyway? when the playlist for the chunks runs out?\nexample cmd\nlivestreamer -l debug -p \"mplayer -vo null -ao jack -\" http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-media-channel 720p+\n. I ran livestreamer with the -O flag like this\nlivestreamer -l debug -O http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-media-channel 720p+ >media.flv\nand then let it run for a while until I saw several loading module msgs, then once it started receiving chunks again I viewed the file in vlc.   The file had missing video, i.e. commentator was talking and then stopped mid sentence. (it was running ISS Live at the time) so for me the -O redirected to a file has problems and seems to have more problems consistently.  In addition, I ran a church service earlier this evening which aborted with a crash because it had an unknown video parameter when retrieving the first chunk.  The stream is not live now, so I don't think it would give the same error.\nIt does seem as if there are some corner cases missing in the ustreamtv plugin that we might be hitting either by design by ustream or just dumb luck.  My python skills are not great, so it will take me a little while to fully understand the logic in the plugin. In any rate, it should be pretty reproducible. Do we think the problem is in the ustream plugin or librtmp python library? Both were updated about the time this seemed to start for me.\nDid you look at some interactive content like public channel / education channel, or were you looking at hdev? Is it possible the content was fairly static when you looked so you thought the video was not having problems?\nPlease check an interactive feed such as nasa public or nasa education and verify it works for you. I am seeing this on python-2.7 and Linux.\n. I'm watching the educational channel now and I think either the penalty applied to us is time-based and since we can fetch a lot of chunks, we may get further and further behind in the delay blocks, or maybe you don't get penalized for lower bitrate streams. I suspect the penalty may be happening because we pull chunks with a new http session rather than using the same one like the flash players.  If you run the 240p feed for a long time like half an hour, do you see one massive gap or is the player somehow able to keep up?\nPlus by capturing it to a file and then playing it back, you have the ability to stall out for a long time, then fetch a whole bunch of chunks at faster-than-real-time and catch up.  If, on the other htand, you are playing it out in real-time, I suspect the 240P feeds will pause as well, although admittedly it doesn't seem to be as bad as the other hd feeds, so maybe there reall yaren't any gaps after all.\nYou can really see the gaps like this\nlivestreamer -O http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-media-channel 720p|mplayer -vo null -ao jack -\nYou'll see the gaps if you watch the status crawl output of mplayer and you will see it loading module info at that time repeatedly.\nI think a good place to start here would be to find out what the code path is when loading module info and a chunk is not retrieved. That might tell us a clue.  I'm seeing gaps in the 240p stream as it waits, but those gaps would not be visible if you're playing a file back because you can play right through the gap as if no time had elapsed.\nso as long as the chunk you want when you are behind is available in the CDN ringbuffer, and if you can download faster than real-time, you should be able to retrieve all the chunks before they disappear.  If you are seeing 404s for the 720P streams, you may be trying to pull a chunk that is older than the \"ringbuffer\" available on the CDN for the channel.\nIt's not really a ringbuffer but you get the idea, older chunks are purged to make way for new ones.  Since all the clients probably run at different points in time, there needs to be a little bit of overlap between now and the past.  We may be simply dealing with the amount of time it takes to go set up a new session with a penalty from ustream.\nConsider from ustream's point of view. They don't want livestreamer to run, but they do want multiple people behind a NAT to be able to watch the same stream. They can't simply limit each IP to one session, and they don't want too big of a delay for the flash player to load. The solution is to penalize an IP that misbehaves or is particularly active, probably with some sort of weighted penalty.\nI've been watching educational channel for the duration of typing this post and only see some minor blips as we pull new content and waiting for the next chunk.\nThis particular channel, if memory serves, is actually an SD feed on the NASA mux. I see they have a 720P feed for it, so they might have begun encoding education in HD. I can check, but I'm pretty sure the satellite feed for Education channel is SD, that may be part of why we are able to pull this without interruption.\nThe 240P stream for live-iss-stream is not so forgiving.  I just saw a small gap in the education feed of about 5 or more lost seconds in the video. I did not actually see it in the frame count output, instead the content playing out had a jump.\n. so what would need to happen to remember enough state across callbacks so we can reuse the same session each time we want to pull some chunks? It seems that might be the reason, but maybe not the entire story.\n. I've been digging into this a little over the last couple days. I had hoped to fix it before the Soyuz docking, but that didn't happen.\nI looked at implementing a harmless change, like reporting the number of concurrent viewers to the caller. I got it to report a float (i.e. there are 505.0 viewers of this stream) but I think I know how to fix that, just use int instead of int / float in the schema definition. This is my first python adventure so things are going a little bit slower than I had hoped, but not much.\nNext looking at what appears to be going on, ustream sends moduleInfo messages towards the client after connect.  In the flash version wireshark packets, the client (after receiving the moduleInfo message) sends a playing() call, and then waits for more moduleInfo messages.  Every so often, it sends stats() messages.\nLivestreamer connects, gets a single moduleInfo() message and then hangs up on the connection.  The next time he connects, he gets the same moduleInfo() message and thus the same chunk he has already downloaded.  Finding no new chunks, he hangs up and trys again.  I don't know how rapidly this sequence happens, but ustream probably penalizes him because he is constantly connecting.\nso things on today's todo:\nmake it send the playing() message towards ustream\nmodify the main process thread to not hang up upon single moduleInfo() message, and verify this is going to be thread-safe when two or more are running at the same time since at first glance it looks as if the flash version might run two threads.\nThen I will figure out if the stats methods are required, if it is possible to deal with them, and report back on my progress.\nI may leave the number of viewers in there. I also added a video codec check in the schema so in the future if somebody wants to they can implement some sort of \"this stream is mpeg4, this one is mpeg2\" so that the livestreamer could be told to pick an mp4 vs mp2 stream or whatever.  At the moment, however, they're all coming up mpeg4 / h264.\nSo even though all I have really done is added a printable, I now understand the ustream plugin code better. I suppose that's a win. :)\n. well I've got it reusing the connection, but I'm not convinced it is much better.  I'm not convinced it isn't either. I tried to implement the playing() call but it doesn't look right in the tcpdump since I didn't encode the reason object. Nevertheless, the moduleInfo objects keep showing up, only thing is it skips chunks because it isn't offered them. I'm in #livestreamer on freenode if you want to work this real-time.\n. I've tried a couple things, and here are my results:\nPrefetching \"old\" chunks does not work, i.e. let's say the chunk number is 55, and the range is from 48 to 58, chunks 49 - 54 are not available (404)\nI tried prefetching the future, and that doesn't work either--I was able to prefetch maybe one or two chunks in advance, but got 404s for the rest (I tried to fetch the whole range)\nand, with the current implementation, if you get a 404, you'll never try the chunk again. This is because the chunk is already in the chunks list and the iterator to add chunks checks the list before adding the chunk again.  I'm hesitant to try to add a new field to Chunks that indicates whether the chunk was downloaded or not because that would require some synchronization between the worker thread and the writer thread.  As it stands, it probably isn't thread-safe unless there's some mechanism in python that protects lists or named tuples.\nThe way I see it there are two possibilities.\n1: need to implement the stats() function to relay back to ustream which chunks were downloaded\n2: investigate why we are not responding to set bandwidth calls from ustream.  Both suspiciously look like they might solve the problem.  The flash player does both.\nIn any rate by singly connecting and implementing the playing() call, things seem substantially better, I'm missing two chunks, and I have a thought about maybe coaxing the download thread into fetching them late. Hopefully that will provide an unbroken stream, and hopefully it will not starve out a player.\nIf you're curious, this is with the nasa media channel that operates at 720P.  Not having proper AMF3 support is proving to be a bit annoying because my ustream calls don't look like the flashplayer calls. Hopefully ustream can read amf0 still, but that will probably go away in the future.\nAnyway it's getting better.\n. ok yes now it is running glitch-free, at least for me.  It might be related to bandwidth as well.  I have enough bandwidth to run several times real-time for the stream, so I can \"catch up\" if you will rather quickly.  I'm curious to see what happens if you run this on a slower connection.\nAs I was playing with this, I noticed one schema failure for streams, and once I was \"unable to retrieve desktop streams\" so I'm looking at the first one to see what's wrong with the schema.  I'm still not convinced this solution is the correct solution, because the messages appear to come less often for livestreamer clients than the flash client.  Basically what I have done is the following:\n1: reuse the same connection to get more chunks rather than going through setup each time we want more chunks\n2: send playing() method to server (not convinced this is really required)\n3: relax chunk retrieval rules to fetch stale chunks that \"should\" be missing but are mysteriously still hanging around on the servers. This means when you try to pull chunks that cross a range boundary you will get \"earlier\" chunks rather than starting at the range boundary (thus the reason for \"missing\" chunks)\nTODO: handle failure cases better and make sure we didn't botch failure notifications\nHow do I get this put into a code review?\n. I've put my changes in https://github.com/jthall/livestreamer.git\nLet me know how that works for you.  It appears there may still be a small hang upon start, but then you don't see it after that. I think that might make omxplayer unhappy, but you can let me know since yo uuse that.\n. I have noticed that as well, and am running some parallel tests between the mobile stream and the uhs stream. I think the timeout msgs are because our tolerences are too stringent.  I think I may have botched the exception mechanism, so it will never fail in the module info process loop. We are benefiting from that because the player eventually does get the chunks.\nBasically it goes like this.\nThe module info message informs the client of some information. Sometimes that information is the streams object. This one tells us about new chunks. The plugin gets mad if we come out of the module info block without a valid streams object, so I wrote a loop that iterates 50 times through module infos looking for valid streams object.  At some point it decides the timeout has been reached and whines about it. Whether that is between getting module info messages or ones we view as valid I don't know.  I'm sure this code could be refactored a bit, but this was a 'first step' to see if the logic is sound.\nI found another stream that the flv parser doesn't like, that is probably an unrelated bug, but since that stream does not broadcast all the time it is difficult to test with it. Maybe it is due to whatever is encoding the service. I know the broadcaster and can contact them to find out about it.  If you find some more streams that just flat out don't work let me know.\n. so it's been a little over a month. How is the testing going with your streams, @liamkennedy? I haven't really looked at this in great detail over the last month, life got busy.\n. yes I have tested all the streams and they're seemingly working fine.\nI would be interested in why it was not working for you, so do please\npost your observations.\nOn 9/8/15, liamkennedy notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSorry for the delay.

You can't prefetch between the\n\"active\" and \"end of avails\" window because that is apparently in the\nfuture, you regularly get 404s if you try that. You can get \"stale\"\nchunks that are older than the start of the avails window. At one time\nI intended to implement the bandwidth() function to just tell the\nustream servers we want 1.5m or whatever the flash version sends (I\ndon't remember off the top of my head) but the servers may require\nRTMPv3 towards the server (currently livestreamer can receive an\nRTMPv3 payload, but not generate one)\nWhen you set the bandwidth properly, you get the module info calls\nfrom the server more often, so you don't have problems with stale\nchunks.  The app is only told about new chunks when it gets a module\ninfo message from the server.  If the app is told more often that new\nchunks are available, it never is trying to retrieve chunks outside\nthe avails window.\nI don't know if I will have tons of time to look at this this week,\nbut maybe the servers will take v0 objects instead of requiring v3\nobjects.\nOn 9/13/15, ErAzOr2k notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOutput from debug log:\n2015-09-13 15:13:22.241 spawn:

GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/860#issuecomment-139873310\n. hmm maybe the reason my version seems to slow down is that if the\nmoduleinfo calls come late and so we backfill fetching, but then play\nout in real-time, since the player is playing all chunks in real-time,\nit is possible it will be behind because it doesn't \"skip\" chunks like\nthe official version does. How far behind does it get over a period of\ntime? It could catch up if module info calls are late, but then it\nwants to play all the \"back\" or missing video. This means the\nartificial delay imposed by ustream for us would make the player fall\nfurther and further behind. The only way you could stay current is if\nyou did not have a real-time component forcing playback at a constant\nrate.\n\nso to make this simpler, let's say you get 10 seconds of good video,\nthen ustream throttles and you have to wait 5 extra seconds before you\nare notified new video is available. Now if you get another 10 seconds\nof video, that 10 seconds will play out 5 seconds late. Each time\nthere is an artificial delay, the player is \"catching up\", but new\nvideo is presented to it at faster-than-real-time because the\nlivestreamer process is cheating and trying to scarf up old stale\nchunks before they disappear from the CDN.  The net.effect is that any\nartificially-introduced delay from ustream will slow down a real-time\nplayer forever until either the viewer can process video at\nfaster-than-real-time rates or gives up.\nSo it appears we currently have two choices--either to watch with the\nofficial livestreamer and sortta keep up with real-time but have\ndamaged video and missing chunks, or use my player and slowly drift\nbehind over time until we overflow the input buffer of the player and\ndrop a lot of video.\nAdmittedly I spent more time working with archiving instead of live\nvideo. Either the bandwidth command makes ustream deliver chunks more\non-time or there's something else we're missing.  I'm not going to\nhave much time over the next couple weeks to dig deeper into this, but\nI do hope to get back around to looking at it again.\nOn 10/3/15, liamkennedy notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOh wow.

Are you wanting the content to write to a single file even if the stream ends and then restarts?\n\nYou might be able to use a shell script and use vlc to output .ts format to a file, that way you don't have to deal with flv headers in the middle of your file.  If you use () in your script, you can put the livestreamer command in a loop that behaves, like sleeps between attempts to get an offline stream.\n. Hi,\nI'm not familiar with this command syntax. oh wait a minute this\n:start is a label. I understand now.\nI must admit I'm not familiar with the variable substitution used. Are\nyou trying to archive this stream on a daily basis, play it with a\nflash player, or something else?\nThe simplest solution here might be to use ffmpeg to read the flash\ncontent on stdin and then output with -f mpegts -v copy so it doesn't\ntry to transcode anything, then write the output to a file. You could,\nfor example, do something like this. This example isn't for what you\nwant, this example pulls the audio, deletes the silence, and then\nencodes it at mono 48khz.  There's probably a better way to do it than\nthis, but it works. You basically run this command and use >> to write\nthe mp3 to a file.  The gist here is the stuffin () gets executed as a\nsingle shot and the lame process stays open because stdout of the\nparent never closes due to the while loop never exits.

Hey guys, I spent the last day or so trying to figure out a handful of problems I've been getting with Livestreamer and Ustream. In the past I had found a fix here: \nhttps://github.com/jthall/livestreamer\nfor the issue with Ustream's UHS streams intermittently losing chunks and freezing. It worked great for a while, unfortunately I then ran into the problem discussed in this thread, where the HD UHS streams are not found. Paul's fix took care of this right away. So using the commit logs I went through the ustreamtv.py and basically merged all of the changes from the two different fixes into one file. \nI was honestly surprised that I didn't break anything when I saw it run, and everything works 99% perfectly for me now. My stream popped right up in 720p+ and I've only gotten one 2 second freeze in the last 20 minutes of letting it run, but I'm not sure if that is even related to this issue. I believe this is exactly the problem you are mentioning @liamkennedy. The only change is in the ustream plugin, so I've uploaded the file here:\nhttps://mega.nz/#!JRlFlKhI!6T4bS08wWvZEJOv9iuvQoR52BOL-GuqvUxyn4K2ZKAs\nFor windows users, download it and copy/replace it into your C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer-1.12.2-py2.7.egg\\livestreamer\\plugins directory.\n@m4a2000, @Palmthief this should be pretty easy to make work. \nI really don't understand github enough to make this a separate fork or how to integrate it into another OS, but I'm sure you guys are smart enough to make it work for you. Enjoy!\nEDIT: If your current livestreamer has some conflict or incompatibility with this, the process that made this work for me was to first clean install the nightly build, then replace the ustreamtv.py file.\n. Alright, try this for the same fix.\nhttps://github.com/spaceplumber/livestreamer\n. @m4a2000 not sure what you mean. I'm on windows 7 and all the files in Livestreamer\\livestreamer-1.12.2-py2.7.egg\\livestreamer\\plugins are .py files. There's no need to compile anything.

You could even open the file with notepad and just copy and replace the code into the one that is already there.\n. @m4a2000 hmm interesting. I had installed it from an .exe previously so it set up the path for me. But to install the nightly build I just deleted everything in the program files livestreamer folder and pasted the files from the nightly build. Then replaced the ustreamtv.py file. \n. @Palmthief hopefully you can make this work:\nhttps://mega.nz/#!FEsSkLpZ!ayjaxkD_u1KFtrA1xvV6jWvFGsfd7wzkZ0BQhhHCgV4\nDelete everything in your C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer folder and paste in the contents of this zip after extracting it.

Thanks @StarWolf3000 but oddly, I'm still encountering the same error with 90% of the streams I'm attempting, 24 hours later...\nVery perplexing\n. @trocknet Thanks, Afreeca streams eventually started working a few days later. \nAs another issue, is there a way to bypass the 15 second timer for HLS streams? I used your trick with:\n``` python\n else:\n            if sequence.segment.uri.find(\"afreeca\")!= -1 and (sequence.segment.uri.find(\"_0.TS\")!= -1 or sequence.segment.uri.find(\"_1.TS\")!= -1 or sequence.segment.uri.find(\"_2.TS\")!= -1):\n                return    \n            content = res.content\n    self.reader.buffer.write(content)\n\n```\nin the hls.pyc file, but it no longer appears to be working...\nThanks\n. @trocknet Hmm very strange, can you confirm you're able to view HLS Afreeca streams without the timer? \nFor example:\nafreeca.com/wnnw\nafreeca.com/gtv7\nafreeca.com/ch1716\nNo timer with non-HLS Afreeca streams, but I always see a timer with HLS streams, unfortunately :(\n. Would love to see afreeca.tv streams supported!\n. Would love to see afreeca.tv streams supported!\n. Thanks for these updates! \nWould you be able to add support for Huya.com also? It's player/interface look very much like Douyu and Longzhu, if that's of help!\n. ",

Livestreamer is no longer being supported. Please take a look at its successor, Streamlink, available here: https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink. @10mins can you run me through how you got to that command (In case they change something and I need to do it on my own) and how I actually use it? I have rtmpdump, but cmd doesn't recognize what you posted as a command line. \n. @biezom Yeah, I'm trying this on my Windows PC, and it's tellming me \"rtmpdump\" isn't recognized as a command. The only instance I have of rtmpdump comes preinstalled with livestreamer.\nCan you tell me how that command works and how you built it, so I can do so on my own and not waste your time :)\n. @skulblakka hm, Netstream.play.failed when I open a command prompt in the rtmpdump folder and run the last command from biezom\n. @biezom The novatv hlsvariant one works perfectly. Since I have no idea how to turn that into a plugin, I'll just save it online and copy it when needed. I'm going through your explanations, might take me some time to correctly parse them, since I'm bad at things like this, but truly - thank you!\nI will use these livestreamer codes a lot, since whenever I travel I carry a small Lubuntu laptop, that can't handle flash streams like these outside of viewing them via livestreamer.\nThe BNT one seems to be faltering. I'm getting this message:\n\"Unable to open URL ... No connection adapters were found for 'rtsp://127.0.0.1/access.denied\"\nThe BNT ones might be trickier somehow, there are 4 channels (I gave you the HD one) that are positioned at http://tv.bnt.bg/, and 3 of them are as I previously said hardcoded to Bulgarian IPs. Might that be the problem?\nWhen viewing the source of the BNT World channel, I find this info:\niframe source = http://showww.bnt.bg/sat/\nrtmp source = rtmp://193.43.26.198:1935/live/bntsat\nBut I can't seem to find a m3u8 file, which to incorporate into your previous code. \n. @Biezom I do have one, as I'm currently in Bulgaria, but I still can't connect. I'm missing something I guess o_o\n. @biezom Okay, now it works. I'm guessing I have to do this every time I want to livestream it. \nhttp://tv.bnt.bg/ - The same method should work for BNT2 and BNT1, since they're hardcoded to Bulgarian IPs, right? Can't figure out the BNT World one though.\nAlso, if I'm outside of Bulgaria, I should add a proxy to the livestreamer command, so that it looks as if I'm within Bulgaria, correct?\n. Thank you, all of these work perfectly. \nWhere does the --http(s)-proxy go in the command?\n. @BaconEggCheese777 Livestreamer is no longer being updated.

If simplistically\n\nAlso possible to to use Internet Download Manager or Wireshark with filter http.request.uri contains \"m3u8\" \n\nFor Russian speaking read this and below:\nhttp://forum.sc2tv.ru/threads/46848-%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D1%81-twitch-tv-justin-tv?p=2347253&viewfull=1#post2347253 \n. It is necessary to enable the integration of the browser\n\nPerhaps you need to put another version of the program. I use:\nhttp://open-tor.org/torrent/417900/internet-download-manager6.23-build-14-2015-pc-repack-by-kpojiuk\nNow the m3u8 playlist is issued if you are not logged in!\n\n\n. I think is possible try to increase --file-caching  if stream is buffering but not sure. I do not use it. Also have the opportunity to use a proxy in livestreamer.\n. It seems it is just a non-working playlist. For example, he does not open in VLC or MPC-player.\n. https://yadi.sk/d/Au52pKjKufT6q\n. Your change will not work with stream as a http://goodgame.ru/channel/Peptar/, http://goodgame.ru/channel/Pomi/. It is necessary to to change the parameter.Example here:\nhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/commit/7f73960b18720fcfec3a746c5bbd442a2a05cf75\nThanks for the correction plugin!\n. Strange. For me it works if I change only twitch.pyc. If I replace main.pyc displays an error.\n\n. @javiercantero Sorry, but I'm not a programmer and do not know how to do it. I tried to change the * .pyc in the * .py (downloaded from https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) in the directory C: \\ Program Files (x86) \\ Livestreamer \\ livestreamer-1.12.2-py2.7.egg \\ livestreamer\\ and C: \\ Program Files (x86) \\ Livestreamer \\ livestreamer-1.12.2-py2.7.egg \\ livestreamer_cli \\ and replace twitch.py and main.py, but  getting the same result.\n. @javiercantero Hmm ... how can I run this on windows? There is no executable files.\nP.S. It seems understood - \"python setup.py install\". But it installed in Python directory. Can I  choose the path for the installation?\n. @javiercantero Okay. Anyway, thank you.\n. @Summon528 You did not understand. Above I wrote that with only replaced twitch.pyc everything works fine.\n. Try this: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/1483#issuecomment-247854848\n. This is fix: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/1483\nTry this:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoneFox78/livestreamer/b48b903af65b2d0da4a77758fee80fa735ca1eee/src/livestreamer/plugins/twitch.py\n- save this and then delete \"twitch.pyc\"(by saving it in a different directory) in directory \"plugins\" (for me it: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer-1.12.2-py2.7.egg\\livestreamer\\plugins\\ ) and copy there saved \"twitch.py\".\n  You can also read: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1478 & https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1456 - same question.\n. https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490 - a similar question\nAlso, read this: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1502\n. Fine!\ngoodgame.ru/channel/... works too!\n. I have created a working plugin using it: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/1160, but it is quite raw and some channels do not work (at least https://goodgame.ru/channel/Miker/):\nhttps://yadi.sk/d/-MA5GdyrxbmN7\n. Works, but with interruptions. Perhaps triggered by DDoS protection. I forgot to warn: only \"best\" quality. @psihkakihmalo use https://yadi.sk/d/-MA5GdyrxbmN7 (not https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/1160)\n. @intact 'socket.error' Errno 10054\n. @psihkakihmalo \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0432\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b \u0438 \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u043a\u0438?\n. @intact Yes of course!\n@psihkakihmalo \u0436\u0430\u043b\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442 :( .\u042f \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043b.\n. @intact get the same:\n\nAnd my plugin works for you? Try please(https://yadi.sk/d/-MA5GdyrxbmN7)\n. @intact yes:\n\n. Probably it would have helped authentication, as was done in the Twitch plugin(https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/1483). This is stated in https://github.com/GoodGame/API/blob/master/Streams/v2/authentication.md (unfortunately only in Russian)\nPage register a new application (personal profile):\n\n. @intact it is your plugin?How about my?\n. @intact it works?Yea!\n. @intact Unfortunately I do not understand this, so I can not help :(\n. @intact I tried both your plugins on Linux(via Oracle VM VirtualBox) and it works! But on windows not work even through vpn(CyberGhost 5)\n. @intact I am using for Windows a version \"livestreamer-v1.12.2-win32-setup\". Our plugins (my, your and psihkakihmalo(corrected)) work for livestreamer on Linux and  for https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases (streamlink-0.0.2.exe)  on Windows. Now I think the problem is an error (bug or something similar) in the version of the Python library this old livestreamer build. Can you create a pull request for streamlink (maybe leaving unchanged the part relating to DDoS, to avoid problems if inclusion of protection against DDoS on site)?\nPlugins that I have used (if needed): https://yadi.sk/d/IXmPIBEHxnCZf\n. I think this should help:\nhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490#issuecomment-248632748\n. maybe \"--twitch-oauth-token\"?Or try replace plugin (https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490#issuecomment-248632748) and then I think this parameter is not needed.\n. Try this: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490#issuecomment-248632748\n. Try this: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490#issuecomment-248632748\nOr use https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases\n. Maybe using streamlink https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases instead livestreamer solve your problem?. If I correctly understood and need a URL to an external player, you can use these commands for command line:\nyoutube-dl -g --all-formats URL > info.txt\nyoutube-dl -g URL > info.txt\n(http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/). For complete information can be used -j instead -g\nSimilar commands for livestreamer:\nlivestreamer -j   URL > info_ls.txt\nlivestreamer -j   URL best > info_ls.txt. Happy to help :). I can not create the plugin, but I can offer an alternative. You can use Internet Download Manager (IDM) or Video DownloadHelper for Firefox to get URL for hls-playlist (https://videos-f.jwpsrv.com/content/conversions/f7waFglx/videos/zBs3suba-26487538.mp4.m3u8?token=0_584eaadb_0x6c65c3f73e698f7d431fa3b7c6fad7e9b676d7ed   - for your video above) and then download via  livestreamer:\nlivestreamer -o filename.flv  --hls-segment-threads 10  hls://URL best. Maybe you just try\nffmpeg -i \"http://abclive.abcnews.com/i/abc_live4@136330/index_1200_av-b.m3u8?sd=10&b=1200&rebase=on\" -c:v copy -c:a aac .......\nwithout the livestreamer?. ffmpeg -re -i \"http://abclive.abcnews.com/i/abc_live4@136330/index_1200_av-b.m3u8?sd=10&b=1200&rebase=on\"  -c:v copy -c:a aac -ar 44100 -ab 128k -ac 2 -flags +global_header -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -bufsize 3000k -f flv \"rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/<STREAMNAME/KEY>\"\nNot sure whether it is necessary \"-re\"\nI am no expert on this, so you'd better read this: http://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/StreamingGuide and similar.. Apparently, this is due to the format M3U8. Probably you really need livestreamer or vlc or something similar.\nPerhaps you'd better ask the same question in a  streamlink theme https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues because https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1550. Found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLStreams/comments/3o5x3j/quick_tutorial_on_using_ffmpeg_to_restream/\nso restream of m3u8-playlist  with only ffmpeg is possible.\nBTW I can not open your playlist:\nhttp://hlslive-l3c.med2.med.nhl.com/ls04/nhl/2016/04/16/NHL_GAME_VIDEO_NYRPIT_M2_NATIONAL_20160416/master_wired60.m3u8\nin vlc-player. It is working for you?. If you only use ffmpeg without livestreamer you can ask questions in this forum: http://ffmpeg.gusari.org/index.php. Use latest https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases instead livestreamer(https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1550). .

In other operating systems, you can do it in their own way. The basic is the command for ffmpeg.. I think you need to create a new issue. So a better chance of being seen. Also probably better to create issue here: https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues , as livestreamer is abandoned.. @dajoka If url expires quickly how you get a new url ?. So you create a bat-file? If so, show it here. If not, then you need to do it.\nIt would also be good to look at the video source..

Then I have no idea. What you describe should work. Maybe the links that you use the wrong?. That's what I thought. You are using an extension  \"mkv\"  in the bat-file via ffmpeg? It is necessary!. Probably it will help: https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues/150 ?. @rodolfofanti Hi! Livestreamer project is almost abandoned.  I think you need to ask questions in streamlink theme.

For me it works if I change only twitch.pyc. If I replace main.pyc displays an error.\n\n. @javiercantero Sorry, but I'm not a programmer and do not know how to do it. I tried to change the * .pyc in the * .py (downloaded from https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) in the directory C: \\ Program Files (x86) \\ Livestreamer \\ livestreamer-1.12.2-py2.7.egg \\ livestreamer\\ and C: \\ Program Files (x86) \\ Livestreamer \\ livestreamer-1.12.2-py2.7.egg \\ livestreamer_cli \\ and replace twitch.py and main.py, but  getting the same result.\n. @javiercantero Hmm ... how can I run this on windows? There is no executable files.\nP.S. It seems understood - \"python setup.py install\". But it installed in Python directory. Can I  choose the path for the installation?\n. @javiercantero Okay. Anyway, thank you.\n. @Summon528 You did not understand. Above I wrote that with only replaced twitch.pyc everything works fine.\n.

This is fix: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/1483\nTry this:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoneFox78/livestreamer/b48b903af65b2d0da4a77758fee80fa735ca1eee/src/livestreamer/plugins/twitch.py\n- save this and then delete \"twitch.pyc\"(by saving it in a different directory) in directory \"plugins\" (for me it: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer-1.12.2-py2.7.egg\\livestreamer\\plugins\\ ) and copy there saved \"twitch.py\".\n  You can also read: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1478 & https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1456 - same question.\n. https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490 - a similar question\nAlso, read this: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1502\n. Fine!\ngoodgame.ru/channel/... works too!\n. I have created a working plugin using it: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/1160, but it is quite raw and some channels do not work (at least https://goodgame.ru/channel/Miker/):\nhttps://yadi.sk/d/-MA5GdyrxbmN7\n. Works, but with interruptions. Perhaps triggered by DDoS protection. I forgot to warn: only \"best\" quality. @psihkakihmalo use https://yadi.sk/d/-MA5GdyrxbmN7 (not https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/1160)\n. @intact 'socket.error' Errno 10054\n. @psihkakihmalo \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0432\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b \u0438 \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u043a\u0438?\n. @intact Yes of course!\n@psihkakihmalo \u0436\u0430\u043b\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442 :( .\u042f \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043b.\n. @intact get the same:\n\nAnd my plugin works for you? Try please(https://yadi.sk/d/-MA5GdyrxbmN7)\n. @intact yes:\n\n. Probably it would have helped authentication, as was done in the Twitch plugin(https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/pull/1483). This is stated in https://github.com/GoodGame/API/blob/master/Streams/v2/authentication.md (unfortunately only in Russian)\nPage register a new application (personal profile):\n\n. @intact it is your plugin?How about my?\n. @intact it works?Yea!\n. @intact Unfortunately I do not understand this, so I can not help :(\n. @intact I tried both your plugins on Linux(via Oracle VM VirtualBox) and it works! But on windows not work even through vpn(CyberGhost 5)\n. @intact I am using for Windows a version \"livestreamer-v1.12.2-win32-setup\". Our plugins (my, your and psihkakihmalo(corrected)) work for livestreamer on Linux and  for https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases (streamlink-0.0.2.exe)  on Windows. Now I think the problem is an error (bug or something similar) in the version of the Python library this old livestreamer build. Can you create a pull request for streamlink (maybe leaving unchanged the part relating to DDoS, to avoid problems if inclusion of protection against DDoS on site)?\nPlugins that I have used (if needed): https://yadi.sk/d/IXmPIBEHxnCZf\n. I think this should help:\nhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490#issuecomment-248632748\n. maybe \"--twitch-oauth-token\"?Or try replace plugin (https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490#issuecomment-248632748) and then I think this parameter is not needed.\n. Try this: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490#issuecomment-248632748\n. Try this: https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1490#issuecomment-248632748\nOr use https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases\n. Maybe using streamlink https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases instead livestreamer solve your problem?. If I correctly understood and need a URL to an external player, you can use these commands for command line:\nyoutube-dl -g --all-formats URL > info.txt\nyoutube-dl -g URL > info.txt\n(http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/). For complete information can be used -j instead -g\nSimilar commands for livestreamer:\nlivestreamer -j   URL > info_ls.txt\nlivestreamer -j   URL best > info_ls.txt. Happy to help :). I can not create the plugin, but I can offer an alternative. You can use Internet Download Manager (IDM) or Video DownloadHelper for Firefox to get URL for hls-playlist (https://videos-f.jwpsrv.com/content/conversions/f7waFglx/videos/zBs3suba-26487538.mp4.m3u8?token=0_584eaadb_0x6c65c3f73e698f7d431fa3b7c6fad7e9b676d7ed   - for your video above) and then download via  livestreamer:\nlivestreamer -o filename.flv  --hls-segment-threads 10  hls://URL best. Maybe you just try\nffmpeg -i \"http://abclive.abcnews.com/i/abc_live4@136330/index_1200_av-b.m3u8?sd=10&b=1200&rebase=on\" -c:v copy -c:a aac .......\nwithout the livestreamer?. ffmpeg -re -i \"http://abclive.abcnews.com/i/abc_live4@136330/index_1200_av-b.m3u8?sd=10&b=1200&rebase=on\"  -c:v copy -c:a aac -ar 44100 -ab 128k -ac 2 -flags +global_header -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -bufsize 3000k -f flv \"rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/<STREAMNAME/KEY>\"\nNot sure whether it is necessary \"-re\"\nI am no expert on this, so you'd better read this: http://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/StreamingGuide and similar.. Apparently, this is due to the format M3U8. Probably you really need livestreamer or vlc or something similar.\nPerhaps you'd better ask the same question in a  streamlink theme https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues because https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1550. Found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLStreams/comments/3o5x3j/quick_tutorial_on_using_ffmpeg_to_restream/\nso restream of m3u8-playlist  with only ffmpeg is possible.\nBTW I can not open your playlist:\nhttp://hlslive-l3c.med2.med.nhl.com/ls04/nhl/2016/04/16/NHL_GAME_VIDEO_NYRPIT_M2_NATIONAL_20160416/master_wired60.m3u8\nin vlc-player. It is working for you?. If you only use ffmpeg without livestreamer you can ask questions in this forum: http://ffmpeg.gusari.org/index.php. Use latest https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases instead livestreamer(https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1550). .

In other operating systems, you can do it in their own way. The basic is the command for ffmpeg.. I think you need to create a new issue. So a better chance of being seen. Also probably better to create issue here: https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues , as livestreamer is abandoned.. @dajoka If url expires quickly how you get a new url ?. So you create a bat-file? If so, show it here. If not, then you need to do it.\nIt would also be good to look at the video source..

Then I have no idea. What you describe should work. Maybe the links that you use the wrong?. That's what I thought. You are using an extension  \"mkv\"  in the bat-file via ffmpeg? It is necessary!. Probably it will help: https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues/150 ?. @rodolfofanti Hi! Livestreamer project is almost abandoned.  I think you need to ask questions in streamlink theme. There are a lot of knowledgeable people.  I am absolutely not understand this - just accidentally found the question. And not quite understand English :) .

    "X-Looper": "Thanks for your reply, skulblakka!\nYeah, this was something I was thinking myself, that the problem might lie within VLC actually. I just thought it was weird that I had no problems when I disable the HLS Passthrough, like yeterday, I played an entire 8 - 10 hour long stream without HLS Passthrough and it played the entire thing from start to finish perfectly.\nI do have MPC-HC installed as well, but I haven't tried it yet, I do prefer using VLC when watching Streams. But I'm going to see if I can try MPC-HC later today and check if that works as you suggested and I'll report back here after giving it a try.\nIn the meantime, is there any options or such within VLC that you or anyone else here can think of that might be the thing causing this issue with VLC when it plays the Stream through the URL in the player?\nThanks again for any help, I really appreciate it :-)\n-UPDATE-\nI'm running MPC-HC using \"player-passthrough=hls\" right now and the Twitch VOD has just passed the 1 hour mark and hasn't died on me yet, this is a good sign. I'll keep the VOD running for as long as possible, but it does seem that VLC might be the problem here, maybe it has problems with Twitch.tv VOD segments? I believe Twitch cuts VODs into 30 minute segments and maybe VLC has problems updating the URL for the next segment when using HLS?\nAnyway, it looks like I'll be using MPC-HC for all my Streaming needs from now on, thanks again for all the help :-)\n/Regards X-Looper\n. It just happened in MPC-HC as well, just before it was about to hit the 2 hour mark. The video was kinda lagging, like it was dropping frames and stuttering / slowing down and then the video just stopped :-(\nDo you know if MPC-HC has any log as well that I can enable / check the next time it happens? I'm no expert at these sort of things myself, it just seems like the passthrough hls thing makes the playback unstable somehow, albeit it seemed a bit more stable in MPC-HC and I'm running the VOD again to see how long it runs this time.\nskulblakka, do you have these issues yourself when you play a Twitch VOD with HLS passthrough and what player are you using if I may ask?\n/Regards X-Looper\n. Yeah, I noticed now when I tried watching the VOD again, that the video will freeze a bit and get some stuttering going, but it did fix itself. But this is also what happened before around the 2 hour mark when the video decided to die as well, kinda like a read timeout or something.\nI also googled for an error log for MPC-HC right after posting and I couldn't find anything myself. I do want to ask you something though. What kind of settings do you use in Livestreamer for HLS?\nThese are the settings I used before:\nplayer-passthrough=hls\nhls-segment-threads=10\nringbuffer-size=32M\nNow I changed the ringbuffer to 64M and I'm running the VOD again now and it has just passed over the 2 hour mark without dying, but I'm no expert at this so I can't say for sure if this is what might've helped with this issue.\nI have also added some additional settings after browsing through the command list and added these as well:\nHow many attempts should be done to download each HLS segment before giving up\nhls-segment-attempts=10 (default 3)\nHLS segment connect and read timeout\nhls-segment-timeout=30 (default 10)\nTimeout for reading data from HLS streams\nhls-timeout=120 (default 60)\nI have no idea if this will help with the issue at all, as I'm no expert at these sort of things and I'm kinda just testing some things out, but the idea was to try and increase the time and attempts in hopes to avoid a possible read timeout, since I feel like it might have something to do with that.\nThanks again for all your help, skulblakka :-)\n-UPDATE-\nNow the VOD died about 3 - 5 minutes after I posted this new message, so it survived a little longer than 2 hours this time. I will try and launch the VOD again with those new settings I added above to increase the time and attempts for timeouts and hopefully it will help.\n/Regards X-Looper\n. > (this means all the network specific settings like the ones you mentioned will do nothing)\nAre you absolutely sure about this? I ask because I'm watching this VOD again and about 10 minutes ago I was experiencing the video freezing and stuttering again, which was once again around the 2 hour mark. Now according to MPC-HC's Statistics, there's something called Jitter which is displayed in ms and usually hangs around 0 - 5 while the VOD is playing, that thing went haywire and jumped up to around 40 000 during this freeze / stuttering that lasted for about 15 - 20 seconds and MPC-HC also pointed out I lost over 1000 frames during this point.\nIt basically seemed like a huge \"choke point\", if that's the right term to use. However, the video didn't die this time, it actually managed to straighten itself out. This could just be some random fluke as well of course, but the VOD was \"struggling\" for a much longer duration and I was almost sure the video would die again, quite surprised it didn't to be honest and the VOD is still running right now as I'm typing this.\nIs there any negative side-effect by having a huge ringbuffer? I might consider raising it even more after reading what you're using yourself :-)\n/Regards X-Looper\n. > This means: Your problem has nothing to do with the Livestreamer application!\nAlright, so if Livestreamer isn't the problem, what is and how do I fix it? I'm all ears for ideas.\n/Regards X-Looper\n. Thanks skulblakka. I raised mine to 256M, I've had no problems when running Livestreams normally with 32M, but I'm sure my computer could handle a lot more than that. The VOD I ran yesterday managed to run for 9 hours straight as well, so I beat my old record of 2 hours before it died, which is why I closed the issue.\nSo maybe the 2 first attempts when I played the VOD I just had some \"bad luck\" with some choke points that killed the VOD, I just thought it was funny it both happened around the 2 hour mark twice in a row. But at least MPC-HC seems to be more stable than VLC for me and while it might not be a permanent solution to my problem, I'll take any improvement over nothing at all, so many thanks again skulblakka for all your help regarding this.\nI do have one last question for you though, regarding increasing network timeouts and cache size in video players. You mentioned before that you did not have this problem with VLC, are there any settings within VLC that I should check out and do some changes to, that you know might help improve stability when playing VODs?\nI know there's one for cache size and I messed around with that around the time when I first learned about Livestreamer due to me having some issues with buffering. But yeah, I'm no good at these sort of things and if you could just point me in the right direction when it comes to which settings I need to adjust, I would be most grateful :-)\n/Regards X-Looper\n. > I think it affects all VODs on Twitch (I've tested 3 different ones). Livestreams are still working.\nI can confirm this as well, VODs no longer seem to work on twitch.tv\n. > Can confirm, and I think I fixed it (see above).\nI tried some VOD's again and now they seem to be working.

I tried your file but it won't work :/\nI replaced your file with mine, didn't work\nI replaced the folder with the newest nightly build, then replaced the file, didn't work.\nThen i simply opened your file with notepad and replaced the content with my file, also didn't work.\nIf i use the original py file the stream normally works with the crap 360p mobile version.\nI made a screenshot of the error trying your file. Thanks so far for you help!\nhttp://imgur.com/sqAjdAM\nps: maybe you can upload your whole livestreamer folder wich is working for you. Maybe that does the trick.\n. @m4a2000 can you maybe upload your folder for testing ? It didn't work for me so far.\n. @spaceplumber\nHi, so i tried it with your file and same error :/ \nBut then i tried the ustream.tv/opensea link and it works.\nSo apparantly the longer url causes the problems. Because streams starting with a \"ustream.tv/channel/randomstream\" or ustream.tv/explore/randomstream\" cause those problems. Maybe thats why my error screen says \"key error url\" ?\nYou have an idea how to fix this ? :)\n. Guess Spaceplumber gave up on me :(\n. @spaceplumber That's a shame. Anyways thanks for you help! Maybe someone else can look into it ? So close to getting this solved :)\n. Can someone walk me through how to do this ? Or maybe send the modified file to me ?\n. @trUSTssc Thanks for the file. It now shows the better quality streams and loads them.\nBut it's constantly freezing up, sometimes it doesn't load the stream and only shows a black screen with the error...sometimes it freezes in the middle of the stream showing the error i uploaded to imgur. http://imgur.com/BhNTyhy\nReading up the Thread again i guess it's the same problem spaceplumber had. \nDid you by any chance use your own ustream.py file or did you modify spaceplumber's file ? Maybe your fix overwrote spaceplumber original fix for the uhs freeze problem ?\nThanks in advance.\n. ",

    "scottbernstein": "The 403 error (Forbidden) is a \"permission denied\" error usually indicating that you need to pass some additional headers with your request to make the site think that the request came from a web browser -- possibly a cookie or other request headers.  You can find out exactly which ones if you use Chrome or Firefox F12 Developer tools and then watch the network traffic as the original page loads.  If you can find the m3u8 request in there, you'll also see the headers that are passed along with it -- including cookies.\n. Not seeing this at all.  Just tried 3 different live URLs and they all worked flawlessly, even up to 1080p\n. I've never tried running livestreamer from the cloud, just from a local instance.  It was not clear from your question that you were referring to Amazon cloud.\n. Thanks!\nInterestingly enough, the player in the browser must not respect that header because it keeps playing\nAnyway, I've been working around it myself by grabbing the M3U8 stream url from the page source and just hitting that stream directly w/o using the plugin.\n. I may take a stab at fixing this myself.  Will have to teach myself a little Python to do it, but it seems that  the fix would be in hls.py, parse_variant_playlist() in this line:\nstream_name = (names.get(name_key) or names.get(\"name\") or\n                           names.get(\"pixels\") or names.get(\"bitrate\"))\n            if not stream_name or stream_name in streams:\n                continue\nThe code chooses to prefer the name_key if given, then the \"name\" if given, then pixels, then bitrate, and then if the stream_name is already existing, it just skips the duplicates, which means that when you have multiple streams with the same resolution height but different bandwidth, which bandwidth you wind up with will be determined by which stream it happens to parse first in the manifest.\nA simple solution would be to change the stream_name setting line to be this:\nstream_name = (names.get(name_key) or names.get(\"name\") or\n                            or names.get(\"bitrate\") or names.get(\"pixels\"))\nThis would be less friendly to the user but would always work right to discern the difference between all streams.\nIf we want to keep things working generally like they are now -- preferring friendly resolution stream names, we could do something smarter than just hitting a \"continue\" in the loop if the stream name is already in the streams array.  In that case we could re-parse the entire set of streams knowing that there is a duplicate entry and prefer bitrate instead of pixels.\n. Yes, you hit the nail on the head.  --hds-segment-attempts should do exactly what you want.  Why not set it to 100 or 500 tries?  That is essentially ensuring that all segments will be downloaded if you set it high enough.\nOther command line options that will likely help you here:\n--hds-segment-threads (i'd set this as high as possible -- 10)\n--hds-segment-timeout (well, your error specifically says that it timed out...so I'd definitely raise this as well to double/triple/quadruple, until you find something that works)\n. Yes, that is exactly what that error message indicates.\nMore threads allow more requests to be made in parallel.  Gives the program the opportunity for retries for each segment while the other segments continue.\n. Yes, you can do this if you are capturing an hls YouTube stream.  Just pass the command line argument --hls-live-edge SEGMENTS.  The higher SEGMENTS is, the farther back in time you can go.  Some streams only allow you to go back a little  bit.\nNote this is not just for YouTube -- it works for any HLS stream that allows \"rewind\".  Also note that if your HDS stream allows for rewind you can do the same with the argument --hds-live-edge SECONDS.  SECONDS is the number of seconds to go back in time.\nI don't think there's any way to do this for a AKAMAI, HTTP, or RTMP stream\n. Sorry, I haven't taken the time to figure that out.  But yeah, if you just keep increasing the number, you will be able to eventually get back far enough to the beginning.  If you set it to something absurdly high (10000?) you can pretty much be sure that you'll get everything that you can potentially get, going back to the beginning and eventually (usually) catching up to the live stream before too long if you have decent enough bandwidth.\n. there are a slew of command line options for retries and timeouts that can make this happen if you tweak them right.  Depends to some extent on what type of stream it is which options will make it work.\n. --retry-streams is only one of many command line options to play with.  You can read the details of all of them here:\nhttp://docs.livestreamer.io/cli.html\nSome suggestions to try tweaking (and of course note that what protocol the site is using will to some extent limit your options here -- so if you're grabbing an HLS stream, all of the --hls-* options wlll be available to you; same for RTMP and HDS):\n--retry-streams DELAY\n--retry-open ATTEMPTS\n--hds-segment-attempts ATTEMPTS\n--hds-segment-timeout TIMEOUT\n--hds-timeout TIMEOUT\n--hls-segment-attempts ATTEMPTS\n--hls-segment-timeout TIMEOUT\n--hls-timeout TIMEOUT\n--http-stream-timeout TIMEOUT\n--rtmp-timeout TIMEOUT\n--stream-segment-attempts ATTEMPTS\n--stream-segment-timeout TIMEOUT\n--stream-timeout TIMEOUT\n--http-timeout TIMEOUT\nSome combination of these will achieve EXACTLY what you want if you set the number of retry ATTEMPTS high enough (why not set it to 10000 or 100000 attempts) and the TIMEOUT values high enough\n. Also note that the \"--retry-streams\" option will NOT help you in this case because that just sets the amount of time to wait before trying again to connect!  The --retry-open seems like the option you're looking for. The default setting is only to retry once.\n. There are a whole bunch of command-line retry options that you can try.  Check here:\nhttp://docs.livestreamer.io/cli.html#command-line-usage\n. Not really, although I would find that very useful.  It would probably have to be something like --delay-start SECONDS -- where you'd pass in the number of seconds to wait before requesting the stream.  You'd pass in 3600 to wait an hour, 7200 to wait 2 hours, etc.\nIf nobody else has already implemented, I might take a stab at coding this myself.  :)\n. Committed a change to do exactly this:\nhttps://github.com/scottbernstein/livestreamer/commit/900c4d199f721fb57d1e534e37bff11377d1c853\n. The problem is that the parameter \"exp=1459417115\" is an expiration date and time -- in unix \"Epoch time\" (see here to convert to real time: http://www.epochconverter.com/) -- in this case Thu, 31 Mar 2016 14:14:49 GMT.  Once that time passes, the URL will no longer work (it will return a 403 response).\nYou would need to request the video again and use the new URL generated (with new timestamp) for livestreamer.\n.

Thank you guys.\nIs there a way to automatically renew the cookie when it times out?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n. I think your issue is that you have quotes inside of one of your cookie values (glb_uid)\nTry turning the embedded quotes into %22\n. I see the problem here.  Breaking it down into its actual Akamai HD stream URL, which if you find the SMIL request in the page source here:\nhttp://api.new.livestream.com/accounts/17275479/events/4945175/broadcasts/118284313.smil\nThe SMIL gives us the Akamai URL here:\nhttp://livestream-f.akamaihd.net/17275479_4945175_59865394_1_198@24128\nBut an Akamai protocol URL requires an SWF to be passed in.  There are 2 SWF URLs on the page, both of which the plugin knows about:\nhttp://cdn.livestream.com/swf/LSPlayer.swf\nhttps://viewerplus.livestream.com/assets/swf/hdplayer-2.0-viewerplus.swf\nFor whatever reason, the 2nd of these SWFs is no longer working.  If you request it from the server, you get a 404 File Not Found error.\nSince the plugin already knows about both of them but seems to prefer the 2nd, it would be relatively trivial to update the plugin to do one of the following:\n1.  prefer the OTHER url (this is easy and it works but is not the best solution)\n2.  Even better:  Make a request to retrieve the SWF file that it prefers, and if that request returns an error, then try the other SWF URL, and assuming that is successful use it (or fail with an error if none succeeds).\n3.  Best:  If you don't succeed with either SWF URL, then fallback to the HLS stream.\nFrankly I think it might be better to always prefer the HLS stream for Livestream streams anyway because the Akamai stream will always cut you off after sending you exactly 2GB of data on the stream, and the streams I request from Livestream are often more than 2GB.\nI am tempted to make these fixes myself unless anyone has any better ideas?\n. The plugin doesn't recognize the \"youtu.be\" URL.  Click on this link to get the youtube.com URL and use that one.

Livestreamer is not intended to be video transcoding software.

The issue here is the parameter hdntl -- that is an expiration date and time stored as \"unix epoch\" format.

After that time expires, a new token (including hdntl, acl, and hmac below) must be generated for akamai to serve you the file.\nIf you can't get the original site to generate you a new token (usually not difficult) there are Akamai token generator sites that you can look up on google if you search a bit.\nBest,\nScott\n\nFrom: brunomoreno71 notifications@github.com\nSent: Friday, July 22, 2016 1:23:51 AM\nTo: chrippa/livestreamer\nSubject: [chrippa/livestreamer] I get \"403 Client Error: Forbidden)\" (#1412)\nm3u8: http://flacvcms-f.akamaihd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmil/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277~acl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%2f47%2f867%2f693686339688_~data=hdntl~hmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db71768be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291bhttp://flacvcms-f.akamaihd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmil/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277%7Eacl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%2f47%2f867%2f693686339688_%7Edata=hdntl%7Ehmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db71768be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291b\nwith osmfhls.kutu.ru I can see\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer>livestreamer \"hls://http://flacvcms-f.akamai\nhd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmi\nl/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277~acl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%\n2f47%2f867%2f693686339688__~data=hdntl~hmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db71\n768be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291b\" best -o 01.ts\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin stream for URL hls://http://flacvcms-f.akamaih\nd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmil\n/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277~acl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%2\nf47%2f867%2f693686339688__~data=hdntl~hmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db717\n68be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291b\n[cli][info] Available streams: live (worst, best)\n[cli][info] Opening stream: live (hls)\n[cli][error] Could not open stream: Unable to open URL: http://flacvcms-f.akamai\nhd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmi\nl/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277~acl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%\n2f47%2f867%2f693686339688_*~data=hdntl~hmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db71\n768be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291b (403 Client Error: Forbidden)\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer>\n\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1412, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AESJ1ua3FsLch6UunnwU9WMBit54SuSHks5qYFPngaJpZM4JScuN.\n. ...depends on if his testing was inside the time window or not.

(#1427)\n@noodle-https://github.com/noodle- Yeah add me in. I'm proposing the following remediation plan of action:\n1.  We go through the develop branch and ensure all the tests pass and determine code coverage (no more merges until that is done and 2 is done).\n2.  Duplicate and set up the Travis settings to make sure everything is getting tested on a variety of operating systems.\n3.  Begin the very tedious process of merging in some of these existing PRs and noting where they were merged, if possible retain history for the associated user to try and get them involved.\n4.  Start looking through the issues, create tags that are available for users in the new repo which we can port over if needed.\nMy only experience with working on a large project is https://github.com/saltstack/salt/, and I've learned the following from that:\nPrioritize proper release naming, no bugs on releases, and proper issue/PR handling over anything else. If we can get more people who are good with Python involved that would be beneficial.

The problem is that on the Windows version of livestreamer you need to install the compiled version of livestream.py -- which will be titled \"livestream.pyc\".\nUnfortunately since you say you are a non-programmer, this may be difficult for you, but this explains how to compile a .py file to a .pyc file:\nhttp://effbot.org/pyfaq/how-do-i-create-a-pyc-file.htm\nHow do I create a .pyc file? - effbot.orghttp://effbot.org/pyfaq/how-do-i-create-a-pyc-file.htm\neffbot.org\nPython automatically compiles your script to compiled code, so called byte code, before running it. When a module is imported for the first time, or when the source ...\nIf I had recompiled this module myself, I would offer to email it to you, but I haven't.\nPoke me if you're still in trouble after giving an honest attempt at it and if you catch me in a good mood, I'll just do it for you and email it to you.  [\ud83d\ude0a]\nAs a technical person, I don't need (or use) the livestreamer plugin, I just look at the source of the page and find the m3u8 URL myself.  Regardless I've found that the livestream plugin cuts out when the file hits exactly 2GB.  When I reported this as a bug, I was (correctly) told that actually the server just stops sending the stream after it hits 2GB, so it's not a bug in livestreamer.  That said, if you use the HLS stream endpoint, the same problem doesn't occur.  So I manually force it to use the HLS source.\nScott\n\nFrom: Spiral-King notifications@github.com\nSent: Tuesday, September 6, 2016 5:03:04 PM\nTo: chrippa/livestreamer\nSubject: Re: [chrippa/livestreamer] Livestream.com URL Not Working Anymore (#1465)\nThanks for your feedback guy.

Have you ever tried using the \"name_key=bitrate\" option?  My guess is that will help here.  This option helps out when there are multiple bit rates for the same resolution (there could indeed be many bitrate options available, for example, all at 720p resolution) -- some of them may be MUCH higher quality than others.\nIn your case, you would use the option like this:\nlivestreamer \"hlsvariant://http://nrj-apple-live.adaptive.level3.net/apple/nrj/nrjcheriehd/cherie25.m3u8 name_key=bitrate\" best ....etc\nBest,\nScott\n\nFrom: baptx notifications@github.com\nSent: Monday, November 14, 2016 4:52:44 PM\nTo: chrippa/livestreamer\nSubject: [chrippa/livestreamer] Livestreamer can't find the best resolution of this livestream (#1542)\nLivestreamer can't find the best resolution of this livestream: http://nrj-apple-live.adaptive.level3.net/apple/nrj/nrjcheriehd/cherie25.m3u8\nIt plays a very poor quality compared to what mpv finds by default.\nThis livestream is ok: http://nrj-apple-live.adaptive.level3.net/apple/nrj/nrj/nrj12.m3u8\n\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1542, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AESJ1mBZoTYzUvcKwyvOuhn3YvjMjbBJks5q-NgsgaJpZM4Kx2xy.\n.

Even then you might get the best quality based upon random chance.  But I think the reason it defaults to resolution is that is more understandable to most people than \"bandwidth\".\nBut these are only guesses.

For example there are currently many many code updates checked in but not merged.  The maintainer is no longer making updates, so some of the plugins for different sites (Twitch, UStream, others) are breaking as the sites' code has been updated.\nThere is a fork to the project, as I mentioned, called Streamlink which took this project's code as its starting point and has been incorporating fixes/updates to the plugins, and is also considering new feature requests -- it is being maintained by a team of people so that the current situation with chirppa (who is the sole maintainer of livestreamer) loses interest, we are not out of luck.

Here are the commands:\n\"D:\\Video\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer.exe\" --http-header \"User-Agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0\" --http-cookie \"lang=1; _ga=GA1.2.702294065.1504901079; _gid=GA1.2.151708328.1504901079\" -o \"C:\\Users\\Peter Spa Pan\\Downloads\\master.ts\" \"hls://http://file26.watchers.to/hls/,f4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3pjjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7k3blarhoa,.urlset/master.m3u8\" best\nand\n\"D:\\Video\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer.exe\" --http-header \"User-Agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0\" --http-cookie \"lang=1; _ga=GA1.2.702294065.1504901079; _gid=GA1.2.151708328.1504901079\" -o \"C:\\Users\\Peter Spa Pan\\Downloads\\index-v1-a1.ts\" \"hls://http://file26.watchers.to/hls/f4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3pjjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7k3blarhoa/index-v1-a1.m3u8\" best\nThe file \"index-v1-a1.m3u8\" points to the individual chucks with the following format\nEXTM3U\nEXT-X-TARGETDURATION:20\nEXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES\nEXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD\nEXT-X-VERSION:3\nEXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1\nEXTINF:22.417,\nhttp://file26.watchers.to/hls/f4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3pjjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7b743arhoa/seg-1-v1-a1.ts\nEXTINF:22.250,\nhttp://file26.watchers.to/hls/f4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3pjjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7b743arhoa/seg-2-v1-a1.ts\nEXTINF:18.167,\nhttp://file26.watchers.to/hls/f4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3pjjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7b743arhoa/seg-3-v1-a1.ts\nEXTINF:18.667, ....................etc.....\nBUT. There is no way to move Livestreamer to download the stream. Always the same answer 403. Forbidden\nImho it has to do with the timestamps in the cookies, but Livestreamer is supposed to send the appropriate information the the server.\nI would appreciate any hint leading toward a solution. Thank you, guys!\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1626, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AESJ1q4CNsYshw55fJvZa4--ffTAWtffks5sgs9JgaJpZM4PSEPc.\n. The 403 error (Forbidden) is a \"permission denied\" error usually indicating that you need to pass some additional headers with your request to make the site think that the request came from a web browser -- possibly a cookie or other request headers.  You can find out exactly which ones if you use Chrome or Firefox F12 Developer tools and then watch the network traffic as the original page loads.  If you can find the m3u8 request in there, you'll also see the headers that are passed along with it -- including cookies.\n. Not seeing this at all.  Just tried 3 different live URLs and they all worked flawlessly, even up to 1080p\n. I've never tried running livestreamer from the cloud, just from a local instance.  It was not clear from your question that you were referring to Amazon cloud.\n. Thanks!\nInterestingly enough, the player in the browser must not respect that header because it keeps playing\nAnyway, I've been working around it myself by grabbing the M3U8 stream url from the page source and just hitting that stream directly w/o using the plugin.\n. I may take a stab at fixing this myself.  Will have to teach myself a little Python to do it, but it seems that  the fix would be in hls.py, parse_variant_playlist() in this line:\nstream_name = (names.get(name_key) or names.get(\"name\") or\n                           names.get(\"pixels\") or names.get(\"bitrate\"))\n            if not stream_name or stream_name in streams:\n                continue\nThe code chooses to prefer the name_key if given, then the \"name\" if given, then pixels, then bitrate, and then if the stream_name is already existing, it just skips the duplicates, which means that when you have multiple streams with the same resolution height but different bandwidth, which bandwidth you wind up with will be determined by which stream it happens to parse first in the manifest.\nA simple solution would be to change the stream_name setting line to be this:\nstream_name = (names.get(name_key) or names.get(\"name\") or\n                            or names.get(\"bitrate\") or names.get(\"pixels\"))\nThis would be less friendly to the user but would always work right to discern the difference between all streams.\nIf we want to keep things working generally like they are now -- preferring friendly resolution stream names, we could do something smarter than just hitting a \"continue\" in the loop if the stream name is already in the streams array.  In that case we could re-parse the entire set of streams knowing that there is a duplicate entry and prefer bitrate instead of pixels.\n. Yes, you hit the nail on the head.  --hds-segment-attempts should do exactly what you want.  Why not set it to 100 or 500 tries?  That is essentially ensuring that all segments will be downloaded if you set it high enough.\nOther command line options that will likely help you here:\n--hds-segment-threads (i'd set this as high as possible -- 10)\n--hds-segment-timeout (well, your error specifically says that it timed out...so I'd definitely raise this as well to double/triple/quadruple, until you find something that works)\n. Yes, that is exactly what that error message indicates.\nMore threads allow more requests to be made in parallel.  Gives the program the opportunity for retries for each segment while the other segments continue.\n. Yes, you can do this if you are capturing an hls YouTube stream.  Just pass the command line argument --hls-live-edge SEGMENTS.  The higher SEGMENTS is, the farther back in time you can go.  Some streams only allow you to go back a little  bit.\nNote this is not just for YouTube -- it works for any HLS stream that allows \"rewind\".  Also note that if your HDS stream allows for rewind you can do the same with the argument --hds-live-edge SECONDS.  SECONDS is the number of seconds to go back in time.\nI don't think there's any way to do this for a AKAMAI, HTTP, or RTMP stream\n. Sorry, I haven't taken the time to figure that out.  But yeah, if you just keep increasing the number, you will be able to eventually get back far enough to the beginning.  If you set it to something absurdly high (10000?) you can pretty much be sure that you'll get everything that you can potentially get, going back to the beginning and eventually (usually) catching up to the live stream before too long if you have decent enough bandwidth.\n. there are a slew of command line options for retries and timeouts that can make this happen if you tweak them right.  Depends to some extent on what type of stream it is which options will make it work.\n. --retry-streams is only one of many command line options to play with.  You can read the details of all of them here:\nhttp://docs.livestreamer.io/cli.html\nSome suggestions to try tweaking (and of course note that what protocol the site is using will to some extent limit your options here -- so if you're grabbing an HLS stream, all of the --hls-* options wlll be available to you; same for RTMP and HDS):\n--retry-streams DELAY\n--retry-open ATTEMPTS\n--hds-segment-attempts ATTEMPTS\n--hds-segment-timeout TIMEOUT\n--hds-timeout TIMEOUT\n--hls-segment-attempts ATTEMPTS\n--hls-segment-timeout TIMEOUT\n--hls-timeout TIMEOUT\n--http-stream-timeout TIMEOUT\n--rtmp-timeout TIMEOUT\n--stream-segment-attempts ATTEMPTS\n--stream-segment-timeout TIMEOUT\n--stream-timeout TIMEOUT\n--http-timeout TIMEOUT\nSome combination of these will achieve EXACTLY what you want if you set the number of retry ATTEMPTS high enough (why not set it to 10000 or 100000 attempts) and the TIMEOUT values high enough\n. Also note that the \"--retry-streams\" option will NOT help you in this case because that just sets the amount of time to wait before trying again to connect!  The --retry-open seems like the option you're looking for. The default setting is only to retry once.\n. There are a whole bunch of command-line retry options that you can try.  Check here:\nhttp://docs.livestreamer.io/cli.html#command-line-usage\n. Not really, although I would find that very useful.  It would probably have to be something like --delay-start SECONDS -- where you'd pass in the number of seconds to wait before requesting the stream.  You'd pass in 3600 to wait an hour, 7200 to wait 2 hours, etc.\nIf nobody else has already implemented, I might take a stab at coding this myself.  :)\n. Committed a change to do exactly this:\nhttps://github.com/scottbernstein/livestreamer/commit/900c4d199f721fb57d1e534e37bff11377d1c853\n. The problem is that the parameter \"exp=1459417115\" is an expiration date and time -- in unix \"Epoch time\" (see here to convert to real time: http://www.epochconverter.com/) -- in this case Thu, 31 Mar 2016 14:14:49 GMT.  Once that time passes, the URL will no longer work (it will return a 403 response).\nYou would need to request the video again and use the new URL generated (with new timestamp) for livestreamer.\n.

Thank you guys.\nIs there a way to automatically renew the cookie when it times out?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n. I think your issue is that you have quotes inside of one of your cookie values (glb_uid)\nTry turning the embedded quotes into %22\n. I see the problem here.  Breaking it down into its actual Akamai HD stream URL, which if you find the SMIL request in the page source here:\nhttp://api.new.livestream.com/accounts/17275479/events/4945175/broadcasts/118284313.smil\nThe SMIL gives us the Akamai URL here:\nhttp://livestream-f.akamaihd.net/17275479_4945175_59865394_1_198@24128\nBut an Akamai protocol URL requires an SWF to be passed in.  There are 2 SWF URLs on the page, both of which the plugin knows about:\nhttp://cdn.livestream.com/swf/LSPlayer.swf\nhttps://viewerplus.livestream.com/assets/swf/hdplayer-2.0-viewerplus.swf\nFor whatever reason, the 2nd of these SWFs is no longer working.  If you request it from the server, you get a 404 File Not Found error.\nSince the plugin already knows about both of them but seems to prefer the 2nd, it would be relatively trivial to update the plugin to do one of the following:\n1.  prefer the OTHER url (this is easy and it works but is not the best solution)\n2.  Even better:  Make a request to retrieve the SWF file that it prefers, and if that request returns an error, then try the other SWF URL, and assuming that is successful use it (or fail with an error if none succeeds).\n3.  Best:  If you don't succeed with either SWF URL, then fallback to the HLS stream.\nFrankly I think it might be better to always prefer the HLS stream for Livestream streams anyway because the Akamai stream will always cut you off after sending you exactly 2GB of data on the stream, and the streams I request from Livestream are often more than 2GB.\nI am tempted to make these fixes myself unless anyone has any better ideas?\n. The plugin doesn't recognize the \"youtu.be\" URL.  Click on this link to get the youtube.com URL and use that one.

The issue here is the parameter hdntl -- that is an expiration date and time stored as \"unix epoch\" format.

After that time expires, a new token (including hdntl, acl, and hmac below) must be generated for akamai to serve you the file.\nIf you can't get the original site to generate you a new token (usually not difficult) there are Akamai token generator sites that you can look up on google if you search a bit.\nBest,\nScott\n\nFrom: brunomoreno71 notifications@github.com\nSent: Friday, July 22, 2016 1:23:51 AM\nTo: chrippa/livestreamer\nSubject: [chrippa/livestreamer] I get \"403 Client Error: Forbidden)\" (#1412)\nm3u8: http://flacvcms-f.akamaihd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmil/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277~acl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%2f47%2f867%2f693686339688_~data=hdntl~hmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db71768be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291bhttp://flacvcms-f.akamaihd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmil/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277%7Eacl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%2f47%2f867%2f693686339688_%7Edata=hdntl%7Ehmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db71768be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291b\nwith osmfhls.kutu.ru I can see\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer>livestreamer \"hls://http://flacvcms-f.akamai\nhd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmi\nl/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277~acl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%\n2f47%2f867%2f693686339688__~data=hdntl~hmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db71\n768be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291b\" best -o 01.ts\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin stream for URL hls://http://flacvcms-f.akamaih\nd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmil\n/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277~acl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%2\nf47%2f867%2f693686339688__~data=hdntl~hmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db717\n68be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291b\n[cli][info] Available streams: live (worst, best)\n[cli][info] Opening stream: live (hls)\n[cli][error] Could not open stream: Unable to open URL: http://flacvcms-f.akamai\nhd.net/i/video/FLAC_FOD_LATAM/47/867/693686339688_,25,40,12,8,4,2,56000.mp4.csmi\nl/index_1_av.m3u8?null=0&hdntl=exp=1469242277~acl=%2fi%2fvideo%2fFLAC_FOD_LATAM%\n2f47%2f867%2f693686339688_*~data=hdntl~hmac=24daf916645be5bbde3aaf03efc21005db71\n768be8d044b33f036ec5c16c291b (403 Client Error: Forbidden)\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer>\n\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1412, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AESJ1ua3FsLch6UunnwU9WMBit54SuSHks5qYFPngaJpZM4JScuN.\n. ...depends on if his testing was inside the time window or not.

(#1427)\n@noodle-https://github.com/noodle- Yeah add me in. I'm proposing the following remediation plan of action:\n1.  We go through the develop branch and ensure all the tests pass and determine code coverage (no more merges until that is done and 2 is done).\n2.  Duplicate and set up the Travis settings to make sure everything is getting tested on a variety of operating systems.\n3.  Begin the very tedious process of merging in some of these existing PRs and noting where they were merged, if possible retain history for the associated user to try and get them involved.\n4.  Start looking through the issues, create tags that are available for users in the new repo which we can port over if needed.\nMy only experience with working on a large project is https://github.com/saltstack/salt/, and I've learned the following from that:\nPrioritize proper release naming, no bugs on releases, and proper issue/PR handling over anything else. If we can get more people who are good with Python involved that would be beneficial.

The problem is that on the Windows version of livestreamer you need to install the compiled version of livestream.py -- which will be titled \"livestream.pyc\".\nUnfortunately since you say you are a non-programmer, this may be difficult for you, but this explains how to compile a .py file to a .pyc file:\nhttp://effbot.org/pyfaq/how-do-i-create-a-pyc-file.htm\nHow do I create a .pyc file? - effbot.orghttp://effbot.org/pyfaq/how-do-i-create-a-pyc-file.htm\neffbot.org\nPython automatically compiles your script to compiled code, so called byte code, before running it.

[\ud83d\ude0a]\nAs a technical person, I don't need (or use) the livestreamer plugin, I just look at the source of the page and find the m3u8 URL myself.  Regardless I've found that the livestream plugin cuts out when the file hits exactly 2GB.  When I reported this as a bug, I was (correctly) told that actually the server just stops sending the stream after it hits 2GB, so it's not a bug in livestreamer.  That said, if you use the HLS stream endpoint, the same problem doesn't occur.  So I manually force it to use the HLS source.\nScott\n\nFrom: Spiral-King notifications@github.com\nSent: Tuesday, September 6, 2016 5:03:04 PM\nTo: chrippa/livestreamer\nSubject: Re: [chrippa/livestreamer] Livestream.com URL Not Working Anymore (#1465)\nThanks for your feedback guy.

Have you ever tried using the \"name_key=bitrate\" option?  My guess is that will help here.  This option helps out when there are multiple bit rates for the same resolution (there could indeed be many bitrate options available, for example, all at 720p resolution) -- some of them may be MUCH higher quality than others.\nIn your case, you would use the option like this:\nlivestreamer \"hlsvariant://http://nrj-apple-live.adaptive.level3.net/apple/nrj/nrjcheriehd/cherie25.m3u8 name_key=bitrate\" best ....etc\nBest,\nScott\n\nFrom: baptx notifications@github.com\nSent: Monday, November 14, 2016 4:52:44 PM\nTo: chrippa/livestreamer\nSubject: [chrippa/livestreamer] Livestreamer can't find the best resolution of this livestream (#1542)\nLivestreamer can't find the best resolution of this livestream: http://nrj-apple-live.adaptive.level3.net/apple/nrj/nrjcheriehd/cherie25.m3u8\nIt plays a very poor quality compared to what mpv finds by default.\nThis livestream is ok: http://nrj-apple-live.adaptive.level3.net/apple/nrj/nrj/nrj12.m3u8\n\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1542, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AESJ1mBZoTYzUvcKwyvOuhn3YvjMjbBJks5q-NgsgaJpZM4Kx2xy.\n.

Even then you might get the best quality based upon random chance.

For example there are currently many many code updates checked in but not merged.  The maintainer is no longer making updates, so some of the plugins for different sites (Twitch, UStream, others) are breaking as the sites' code has been updated.\nThere is a fork to the project, as I mentioned, called Streamlink which took this project's code as its starting point and has been incorporating fixes/updates to the plugins, and is also considering new feature requests -- it is being maintained by a team of people so that the current situation with chirppa (who is the sole maintainer of livestreamer) loses interest, we are not out of luck.  Like I said -- you can open a feature request in the Streamlink Github and see if anyone shows any interest it taking up your request.\n\nFrom: baptx notifications@github.com\nSent: Wednesday, November 16, 2016 2:22:32 PM\nTo: chrippa/livestreamer\nCc: scottbernstein; Mention\nSubject: Re: [chrippa/livestreamer] Livestreamer can't find the best resolution of this livestream (#1542)\nSince when is the project dead?

Cannot play it (broken) (#1543)\nSo,\nI am recording a live stream (24/7) and write it to a file with -o filename. When I interrupt it (cause I do not know how to cut it in parts e.g. after one minute make a new file with new timecode in name) with ctrl-c and then copy the file from my ubuntu 16.04 server to my Win10 computer I am not able to play that file using various players vlc included. Anyone else having such problems or know how to solve them? I am not sure if the problem itself is the livestream which streams mp4. I tried to save the file as mp4 and flv both did not work. Hopefully it is just me who wrongly use the program than rather a problem with the recording itself.\n\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues/1543, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AESJ1ri5eWn4NLNTz59psqq0-mE4JnRpks5q-blmgaJpZM4KyjKz.\n. Youtube-dl has some built-in integration with ffmpeg to do file format conversions.  That is not part of the design of Livestreamer.  File format conversions or issues with players are left to the user to sort out on their own.  Livestreamer is meant to capture the stream bit-for-bit and not do conversions.\n\nFrom: blackjack4494 notifications@github.com\nSent: Tuesday, November 15, 2016 11:38:14 AM\nTo: chrippa/livestreamer\nCc: scottbernstein; Comment\nSubject: Re: [chrippa/livestreamer] YT Live Stream recording to file.

Thank you @scottbernstein \nI think that there's a rather large issue here....\n\nIt's not for a windows computer.  it's for use with Linux, the Raspberry Pi...\nAnd, I did it within a minute...   but, I also need something that'll work for longer than 1 minute, that's why I was hoping that this program was going to start being supported again...\nI was told that there was a solution that works, but I don't know how to put it into place, it's a change to a few lines of the code...    it's listed at #1277 \nThanks...\n. Maybe, if anyone is able to get a hold of the current person who 'own's' this git, can get a few more people added as admin's to it and then spread out the work a bit?  I'd do it in a second if I knew what I was doing to begin with...\n. Yea, @intact is right...  I use livestreamer with a livestream.com live stream all the time, and #1277 worked perfectly for me!\nhls still doesn't work right, but the normal way works great for me and I use it on a raspberry pi...\nGood luck!\n. How would I install this fix since it's not part of the main files?\nI'm brand new and have little idea on how to do things...   This is for a Raspberry Pi that I'm just learning about...\nThanks!\n. that looks fine except it doesn't work on my Raspberry Pi 3 b....\n. oh, and I don't understand that other thread, but i tried the hls and that's what wasn't working right.  It'll play hls for a few seconds then sit's at a black screen and the only way to get the screen back is to reboot it..\n. Can someone help me to try the other solution 0880 wonderfully suggested?  I tried the hls one and it will play for about 5 seconds or so...  I wanted to try the other solution which seems to be to use a pull version but I have no idea how to do this with a raspberry pi (linux) since I'm just starting with this...   Will continue to research it myself as well but I hope someone can help :)\n. @scottbernstrin\nAny thoughts on how i'd be able to implement that fix to livestreamer that was mentioned in that other thread and in #1277 \n.

I'd do it in a second if I knew what I was doing to begin with...\n. Yea, @intact is right...  I use livestreamer with a livestream.com live stream all the time, and #1277 worked perfectly for me!\nhls still doesn't work right, but the normal way works great for me and I use it on a raspberry pi...\nGood luck!\n.

Didn't spend that much time on trying to figure out livestreamer )\nprint \"ffmpeg -i \" + playlist_url[\"hls_url\"] + \" out.mp4\";\nsubprocess.call(\"ffmpeg -i \" + playlist_url[\"hls_url\"] + \" livestreamer_out.mp4\", shell=True)\nin the function in livestreamer/plugins/periscope.py\nif \"hls_url\" in playlist_url:\n        print \"ffmpeg -i \" + playlist_url[\"hls_url\"] + \" out.mp4\";\n        subprocess.call(\"ffmpeg -i \" + playlist_url[\"hls_url\"] + \"livestreamer_out.mp4\", shell=True) \n        return HLSStream.parse_variant_playlist(self.session, playlist_url[\"hls_url\"])\nto get the url and let ffmpeg download the file.\nHere's how your periscope.py plugin file would have to look like to make live stream downloading work (you must have ffmpeg installed):\n```\nimport re\nimport subprocess\nfrom livestreamer.plugin import Plugin\nfrom livestreamer.plugin.api import http, validate\nfrom livestreamer.stream import HLSStream\nSTREAM_INFO_URL = \"https://api.periscope.tv/api/v2/accessVideoPublic\"\nSTATUS_GONE = 410\nSTATUS_UNAVAILABLE = (STATUS_GONE,)\n_url_re = re.compile(r\"http(s)?://(www.)?periscope.tv/[^/]+/(?P[\\w-\\=]+)\")\n_stream_schema = validate.Schema(\n    validate.any(\n        None,\n        validate.union({\n            \"hls_url\": validate.all(\n                {\"hls_url\": validate.url(scheme=\"http\")},\n                validate.get(\"hls_url\")\n            ),\n        }),\n        validate.union({\n            \"replay_url\": validate.all(\n                {\"replay_url\": validate.url(scheme=\"http\")},\n                validate.get(\"replay_url\")\n            ),\n        }),\n    ),\n)\nclass Periscope(Plugin):\n    @classmethod\n    def can_handle_url(cos, url):\n        return _url_re.match(url)\ndef _get_streams(self):\n    match = _url_re.match(self.url)\n    res = http.get(STREAM_INFO_URL,\n                   params=match.groupdict(),\n                   acceptable_status=STATUS_UNAVAILABLE)\n\n    if res.status_code in STATUS_UNAVAILABLE:\n        return\n\n    playlist_url = http.json(res, schema=_stream_schema)\n    #print \"ffmpeg -i \" + playlist_url[\"hls_url\"] + \" out.mp4\";\n    if \"hls_url\" in playlist_url:\n        print \"Calling command: ffmpeg -i \" + playlist_url[\"hls_url\"] + \" livestreamer_out.mp4\";\n        subprocess.call(\"ffmpeg -i \" + playlist_url[\"hls_url\"] + \" livestreamer_out.mp4\", shell=True) \n        return HLSStream.parse_variant_playlist(self.session, playlist_url[\"hls_url\"])\n    elif \"replay_url\" in playlist_url:\n        self.logger.info(\"Live Stream ended, using replay instead\")\n        return dict(replay=HLSStream(self.session, playlist_url[\"replay_url\"]))\n    else:\n        #print \"else\"\n        return\n\nplugin = Periscope\n```\n.

From there, chrippa can merge it into upstream and also the rest of us can get the patch.

Only one directory asked me to overwrite and existing file with the same name and I hit \"Yes'.\n. \nI put it in there and I still get this message.  I really think it has to do with something Livestreamer.com changed.... Just guessing though.\n. OMG it worked!  Finally after 21 days!  Thank you @intact so much!  @scottbernstein also thank you for trying to help me out.  None of you had to do this but you did and I'm very grateful for both of you!  Thank you!\n. ",

I don't think I know how to :(\nSo, I'm going to \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer-1.12.2-py2.7.egg\\livestreamer\\plugins\" and in this folder, I find chaturbate.pyc ... But when I open it with notepad++ to change the line, it's just a load of random characters :(\nWhere am I going wrong? Can someone please upload the fixed file.\nThank You\n. I downloaded the Windows Binaries file, so I only had the pyc files available to me. I managed to do it though.. I just recreated a blank text file renamed it as chaturbate.py (not pyc like all the others), got the original script from the GIT, edited the line text from above, and then just resumed my script.. It's working fine now :) Thanks a lot!!. Anybody else having problems with this plugin again? The same kind of scenario is happening as before. \nI applied the first fix, and it's been working until last night?\nThanks. Hi,\nPlease forgive me, seems like I found the problem. \nThe hard drive was completely full! \nI'm such an idiot lol, Very sorry.\nThanks anyway.. I think the script is alright, I have a few streams recording, and a few failing for 502 and 404... So I think the site is just having a couple of issues. Hopefully be resolved soon..

Here are the commands:\n\"D:\\Video\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer.exe\" --http-header\n\"User-Agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:54.0)\nGecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0\" --http-cookie \"lang=1; _ga=GA1.2.702294065.1504901079;\n_gid=GA1.2.151708328.1504901079\" -o \"C:\\Users\\Peter Spa\nPan\\Downloads\\master.ts\" \"hls://http://file26.watchers.to/hls/,\nf4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3pjjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7k3blarhoa\n,.urlset/master.m3u8\" best\nand\n\"D:\\Video\\Livestreamer\\livestreamer.exe\" --http-header\n\"User-Agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:54.0)\nGecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0\" --http-cookie \"lang=1; _ga=GA1.2.702294065.1504901079;\n_gid=GA1.2.151708328.1504901079\" -o \"C:\\Users\\Peter Spa\nPan\\Downloads\\index-v1-a1.ts\" \"hls://http://file26.watchers.to/hls/\nf4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3pjjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7k3blarhoa\n/index-v1-a1.m3u8\" best\nThe file \"index-v1-a1.m3u8\" points to the individual chucks with the\nfollowing format\nEXTM3U\nEXT-X-TARGETDURATION:20\nEXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES\nEXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD\nEXT-X-VERSION:3\nEXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1\nEXTINF:22.417,\nhttp://file26.watchers.to/hls/f4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3p\njjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7b743arhoa/seg-1-v1-a1.ts\nEXTINF:22.250,\nhttp://file26.watchers.to/hls/f4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3p\njjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7b743arhoa/seg-2-v1-a1.ts\nEXTINF:18.167,\nhttp://file26.watchers.to/hls/f4c6lo34s2krkhrbon2p3anzqdzb3p\njjcttgnbjnh4hyi3buqp7b743arhoa/seg-3-v1-a1.ts\nEXTINF:18.667, ....................etc.....\nBUT. There is no way to move Livestreamer to download the stream. Always\nthe same answer 403. Forbidden\nImho it has to do with the timestamps in the cookies, but Livestreamer is\nsupposed to send the appropriate information the the server.\nI would appreciate any hint leading toward a solution.
